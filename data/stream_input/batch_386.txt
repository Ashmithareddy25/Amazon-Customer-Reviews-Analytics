B00005JKOJ|5.0|My dad was a movie projectonist when I was growig up and he took me to see Funny Girl when I was in the 4th grade.  I saw that movie 5 times that week and a total of 26 times in every movie theater in town.  What an impression it made on me as a yougster, that if you believed in yourself there isn't anything that you can't do.  Of course it is my favorite movie of all time and one that I watch over and over again as if I had never seen it before.  I see something new every viewing.  Do you want to see one of the greatest performances of all time, then watch her perform \\"I'm The Greatest Star\\" and then watch it again and again, there has never been a debut performance like this one and probably never will again.<br />I have been the BIGGEST Streisand fan since and have followed her through all her movies, saw her twice in concert and have everything she has recorded, albums, tapes, 45's, CD's, foreign releases and hard to find classics, every movie poster, every book written about her and every magazine cover she has been on.  This collection started back in 4th grade and now I am 47 years old so you can imagine the collection.  Of it all Funny Girl has to be the shining moment .  If I could have just a few hours with Ms. Streisand I would thank her and ask hundreds of questions, we are only seperated by 2 degrees of seperation, maybe that day will come!  Buy this movie, if you are not a fan, you will be--I PROMISE.
B0000TG9E2|5.0|Alice In Wonderland was first released in movie theaters in 1951, that's over 50 years ago and Kathyeren Beaumont was a great loving voice for her title character, Alice.  Like Cinderella, she has golden hair and blue eyes...but best of all, Alice has a cat called Dinah.<br />I do love this movie on DVD, esspecially one of my favorite bonus features-Virtual Wonderland Tea Party.
B00018D44U|2.0|Man oh man.  Hell.  Why?  WHY???  Lets start here.  I absolutely LOVED &quot;Come Away with Me&quot;.  I am a person of many musical tastes.  I place that album with some of the best albums EVER...<br />What's amazing is how oblivous those who made this second album are to the subtle tiny nuances which made the first album so perfect.  The warm, thick, &quot;ching&quot; of the tone of the piano.  The warm, analog, fat bottom end.  The lush in-your-face vibe.  Music so involving and encompassing, yet as heavy as any Slayer album in its own way.  There is a certain quality that isn't able to be described regarding the first album.  Everything works both as whole AND on its own.  The ones responsible for the second album seem to have NO appreciation for these amazing qualities from the first album.  What makes the first album so good isn't easy to put your finger on, but there is just an intimacy, a catchiness, a sultry seductive fatness.  The second album...<br />Oh boy.  The album SOUNDS so much like the rear cover.  A bunch of &quot;a bit too old to hang out at the college coffee-house but still hangin'-on&quot; pseudo-intellectual new-agers sitting around trying to convince themselves that they were somehow an integral part of the first album, while seeming adamant on being more present on the second album to try to show how much they mattered.  In truth, they just don't.  Now, I am absolutely NOT against having one's own band for identity's sake.  Look how great Jewel's &quot;Spirit&quot; is due to the warm, involving recording and beautiful musicianship.  Once she lost that, she sucked.  (Anyone heard 0304? Talk about a career-ender.)  Its not that her band is bad in any way, but just that you can hear their influence WAY too much, and their influence just isn't at all up to par with the kind of music Norah Jones is fit to record.  Did anyone hear &quot;Don't Know Why&quot; performed on Saturday Night Live or the Grammy's and think, &quot;Hey, something's wrong,its rushed, there's no feeling in it&quot;???  Well, I for one did, and that was all due to this band.  They simply do NOT have the intellectual capability to grasp the subtle nuances that made the first album great.  No clue.  They butchered &quot;Don't Know Why&quot; on those TV shows, for a lack of feel.  That's exactly the problem with this record.  No feel from the music.  <br />Why did Norah Jones have to do that dreadful Peter Malick album?  WHY?  Dammit if that didn't make her stroll down this path with this one.  No one in the world needs any more lame blues-based back-club guitar music.  Stevie Ray Vaughn? Bonnie Raite?  ARRRGGHHHHH!!!!  The country aspects of this (while I HATE modern country although 70's country is ok; before it became a parody of itself in the 80's) actually only help.  At least it drowns out this fake blues crap.  <br />I'm absolutely NOT against trying new things.  But before you do, at least try to understand the tiny little things that were so great in what you previously did.  There is absolutely nothing of the first album here.  &quot;Caroussel&quot; is ok, and track 9 is alright.  But, I was so hoping for more.  When I bought it, I thought that no WAY was it going to be bad.  Then I heard it, and it took about a day to sink in that I really couldn't make myself like this.  And I tried.  And tried.  Man did I try.  Now, the way I feel, you shouldn't ever have to TRY to like something.  But, I REALLY wanted to love this CD as I did the first.  Sometimes it was actually tortuous, actually forcing myself not to eject the MD of it.  <br />The last atrocity of this CD is this.  You know how the first had that tranquil thick chime to the piano?  That old school, lovely warm &quot;clang&quot;?  It is nearly totally absent from this CD.  This actually RUINS the last song.  Doesn't even sound like a real piano.  Sounds like a midi-piano.  Absolute treason.  The third song has the &quot;old&quot; piano sound.  Must have been recorded at adifferent time or place.  <br />Then, I saw on the liner notes the reason for this horrible act of evil:  &quot;Norah Jones plays Yamaha pianos&quot;.  Not that Yamahas are bad in any way.  But for her to give up her signature piano tone...well that's just about as bad as when Geddy Lee or Paul McCartney gave up the Rickenbacker or when the Beatles recorded without George Martin in 1995.  Its absolute armageddon, and signs that these &quot;artists&quot; have truly lost it.  Its with much shame, despair, and regret that it is happening to Norah Jones so early.  :(<br />Her first album will forever be regarded as one of the best albums of all time.
0385504209|5.0|This has got to be the best book that I have read in a very long time.  Having a Catholic school education, it certainly made me question some of things that I was taught.  This could very well be true.  Also, I will never be able to look at another DaVinci painting again.
B00005JM02|5.0|I must have watched this DVD ten times with my three-year-old daughter. It is very entertaining, with enough \\"character\\" development and humor to hold a parent's attention. <br />The plot is essentially what the name implies. A scuba-diving dentist from Sydney separates a father clown fish named, Marlin, from his son, Nemo. Marlin must cross the ocean to rescue his son. On the way he encounters all sorts of adventures, picks up a charming companion, Dory (who suffers from short-term memory loss), and experiences real character growth. Meanwhile, Nemo gets transplanted into an aquarium with a host of other \\"Fish-Prisoners\\", who spend their time commenting on dental techniques and hatching escape plans. The dialog is delightful and the computer animations are spectacular.<br />There are two scary moments that parents should be mindful of. The first occurs very near the beginning, before Nemo is born. A barracuda attacks Marlin and Coral (Nemo's mother). The mother does not survive, but the violence is not graphic. She is simply not scene after the attack, and her death is implied. However, this scene usually prompts my daughter to ask, \\"Where Nemo's mommy at?\\"<br />The other scary part evolves a shark chasing Marlin and Dory through the hulk of an old sunken submarine (that happens to be in the middle of a minefield). This part is not too bad either, and of course, our heroes escape, unharmed.<br />--David Hitchcock, author, VIRTUAL LIFE and PATENT SEARCHING MADE EASY
B000099T2L|1.0|I hate spending hard earned cash on crap.  I don't get all the hoopla over this cd (you know, winning awards and all).  It is unoriginal and quite frankly, not very entertaining.  I think Beyonce, the person is big, but the music is lacking.  It sounds like everything else out there in this genre (Mya, Ashanti, etc., etc.).  Do yourself a big favour, ignore this and go to the Aretha Franklin section in your record store, now that is something sweet.

B00003CXBK|5.0|The list of great Anime films made by Miyazaki is very long: Castle in the Sky, Warriors of the Wind, Spirited Away are a few that come to mind. This is the first really commercially successful Miyazaki film in the U.S.A. (He's a BIG DEAL in Japan), watch this film and you will know why. <br />  Detailed animations, use of colors and interesting story lines are all hallmarks of a good Miyazaki feature. This film is no exception. Disney is now distributing his films in America, there's no way they could make film like Princess Mononoke so the did the next best thing. <br /> If you are not an Anime fan like me, then Princess Mononoke is a good introduction to the genre. Anime fans, you already know that you should buy this film.
B00005CCA9|5.0|Argerich achieves a level of excitement, propulsion, and drama that is astounding to behold.  Her performance of Rach 3 is infused with a relentless virtuosity coupled with an inspired artistry.  This recording, alone, would have made Argerich a piano legend.  <br />I believe the spirit of the Rach 3 allows for two different, yet complementary, approaches to interpretation: one that is poetic, reflective, and reposeful; another that is assertive, unabashedly passionate, and extroverted.  The wondrously expansive Van Cliburn live recording from 1958 (made just 2 days after his triumphant return from the Tchaikovsky competition!) is an ideal example of the first approach.  The powerhouse performance by Argerich on this disc represents the latter.  Of course, both readings contain elements of poetry and bravura, but I'm referring to the overall character of the interpretation. <br />Whereas Cliburn exhibits a refined and restrained romanticism, Argerich bears a naked lustfulness that would make one blush.  There is an unmistakable and highly-charged eroticism in the Rach 3 that Argerich brings forth which makes any of the Horowitz versions seem like comparative models of Victorian propriety.  The comparison is akin to undressing your lover one button at a time versus tearing the shirt clean off in a fit of unfettered passion.  <br />Consider, as one example, the ascending chordal thrusts in the first \\"mezzo forte\\" section in the last movement (eight bars after the famous glissando).  Argerich turns what usually is a rhythmically labored section for other pianists into an explosion of kinetic excitement.  Just hearing this section alone made me want to buy the CD because it revealed a conception of the Rach I never before encountered - a reading of unsurpassed verve and high-wire confidence.  This is pianism at its most primal and viscerally compelling.<br />Yes, there are mistakes to be found: a wrong note here and there; a synchronization problem before a third-movement orchestral tutti; a missed cue at the cadenza in the last movement; and some muddled passage work where notes are either blurred or almost inaudible.  There are times when one wishes Argerich would give equal prominence to the left hand such as in the electrifying \\"a tempo come prima\\" section in - again - the last movement (where Rachmaninov, in a fit of compositional swagger, unleashes a torrent of sixteenth and thirty-second notes over a static and tranquil orchestral support; the image is that of a peaceful ocean deep whose inhabitants are unaware of the hurricane raging on the surface; the way Rachmaninov concludes this audacious section is the musical equivalent of a rapidly spinning top winding down to a sudden stop).   <br />Yet, there are voices and textures Argerich highlights to beautiful effect in other places that are all but absent in other recordings.  Her relatively small fingers forces her to break some chords in the short cadenza preceding the \\"Tempo I. Alla breve,\\" in the third movement, but, otherwise, she clutches Rachmaninov's hefty chords by the fistful.  Her playing is among the most muscular of any pianist, including Horowitz or Earl Wild.  <br />I'll conclude with one comment on a part of the work that is hardly ever referred to, yet is one of the most achingly beautiful in the entire concerto.  It is the \\"Moderato\\" section that occurs after the first movement cadenza.  A further restatement and development of the movement's lyrical second subject, it takes place soon after the point where the piano (playing an accompaniment based on arpeggio figures) and a succession of woodwinds (reminiscing on the movement's first theme) engage in a tender duet.  Rachmaninov rewrites the last note of each measure of the second subject restatement a third interval lower, thus creating an extraordinary feeling of emotional denouement.  The second subject is the heart of the first movement, and its inspired treatment here represents the culmination of a fantastic musical journey.  Yes, the final \\"Tempo I\\" recapitulation section restates the first theme, thus closing the circle, and soon brings the movement to its technical conclusion; but, in a profound way, the emotional conclusion occurs in the above \\"Moderato\\" section.  <br />Martha Argerich brings this section off in the most soul-stirring fashion imaginable.  It's better than Cliburn's treatment (although his is fine in its own way), and it exposes the Horowitz versions as stilted and over-mannered.  In that moment, Argerich ensured that the most exciting and rapturous Rach 3 was also the most meaningful and touching.<br />Argerich has given us a Rach 3 for the ages.
B00005JLKB|5.0|SMallville is a awsome show sometimes it gets a little off track and the story lines can some times be a little over the top but what show doesnt all in all its great and I highly roccomend I wouldnt skip buying this eason otherwise you may miss a few need to know thing for the next season
B00005JMJ4|2.0|I was very curious about that movie everybody is talking about these days. First of all, don't expect a good scenario because there is none, just everyday banalities. This is mostly about the atmosphere surrounding a very boring hotel life in Tokyo, where two people meet and share their loneliness. I wish that movie could have been shot, let's say in Paris. At least the atmosphere would have been more romantic (instead of witnessing those phony disco clowns everywhere) and with a good scenario, would have been more meaningful. Something is missing in that movie and it would be very presumptuous to even think that movie would get an Oscar for best movie, best director etc... Sofia Coppola could have done a lot better with the two very good actors she had (Murray and Johanssen) but, unfortunately the result is very boring and superficial. It's a nice try though...next time maybe...
B00006690G|3.0|Being a previous em fan, i bought this cd. After a couple of times trough, i was pleased. But this album has no replay value. After listening to it less than ten times, it got stale. The beats are appealing at first, but not intricate enough to keep your atttention every time you listen.they are mostly too simple. As for the rhyming, em is always at his peak. But there is something about hearing the same thing in every song that turns me off to his music. It seems to me em came out with his debut album and was passionate about his rapping. His follow up album the marshal mathers lp was mainly about pressure and the public and his troubles. This cd is mostly about him whining. I say he should be a man about many of these &quot;issues&quot; he claims to deal with. Your better of listening to canibus.
B00005JMJ4|1.0|All of the hoity-toity people that walk around holding one pinky in the air and talk about films using words like &quot;dichotomy&quot; and &quot;apotheosis&quot; will undoubtedly just love, looove this movie.<br />The rest of us mortals will just sit and stare at this pretentious and overly-politically-correct drivel, waiting for something, anything interesting to happen.  And then when nothing does and it's all over, you'll feel like you've been jerked around by the unbearably precious artsy fartsies that created this crap and are now laughing all the way to the bank.<br />If you want to see a movie where the main character (Murray) is as dull and boring as they come, continuously makes poor life choices, and defines the &quot;stupid morally bankrupt American in a supposedly superior foreign land,&quot; then be my guest.  If you want to see a movie where you'll care absolutely nothing for any of the main characters (actually after a while I was wishing Murray would tragically perish in a freak karaoke accident or something, just to get this movie overwith), then go right ahead.<br />Further proof that most critics (overwhelmingly liberal-minded) are so out of touch with the normal folks that they have lost nearly all capacity to tell the good from the awful.
B0001GOH6Q|5.0|Well all i really can say about this movie is in one word...amazing. I saw it in theatres and i just cannot believe how amazing it is. The acting by Ewan McGregor and Albert Finney is just incredible. And of course, Danny Elfman's music is just wondeful just like in every other Burton film.Tim Burton did a great job on Big Fish.
0790729369|5.0|Is there a more beautiful love story than this one...  NO. It's all in softness, and so romantic. What do you do when you are emotionnaly detached from a boring husband, and alone for a few days on an isolated farm in Iowa, when you can feel like a women in love again with someone like Clint Eastwood... seriously, all the ingredients are there for a very moving love story that touches our heart very deeply. I had the chance to &quot;relive&quot; that beautiful love story when I visited the different locations   where the movie has been shot. I am not about to forget that wonderful day!
B00011V8CW|5.0|This forgotten classic Bowie album of 93 is a real treasure. The whole album is solid, and if you like jazz/rock/techno, you'll love this album. The way Bowie reinvintes himself is amazing, and he seems to be successful at every change (this album being no exception).<BR>The album itself is 5 stars, the bonus disc is full of remixes and two pretty good tracks that were unreleased (if you like the album you're sure to like these). What you're paying for is the dvd that comes with it, the Black Tie White Noise video that was released on VHS is now on dvd! It isn't a bad buy, and is pretty cool to see Bowie and his band perform some of his songs of the album, and the documentary is pretty interesting as Bowie mainly discusses the album.<BR>So overall this is a great buy, sure the price sucks....but don't let it stop you from buying this great album. Think of it as paying $15 for the album and $15 for the DVD. If you're a true Bowie fan and can appreciate mose of his work, then you're sure to love this.
B00018D44U|4.0|Norah Jones has one of the most beautiful, sensuous voices in music today. Her first album took advantage of this fact to create a romantic jazz album remeniscent of some of the best female jazz singers of the 30s and 40s. This, her second album, is a left shift (or perhaps a 'southern shift') from her debut.<BR>By southern, I mean country. This is far from a country album in the traditional sense. Norah mixes jazz, blues, rock and superimposes all of these forms onto country chord changes and even some straight country songs (like in her duet with Dolly Parton). As the farthest thing from a country fan, I was suprised at the appeal that this strategy had. She managed to produce catchy, romantic songs which surprises at each key change.<br />I'm not sure I enjoy this album as much as Come Away With Me, but I was certainly delighted that she didn't take the easy road and create an album which would have sold as much as her debut. Artistically, this girl is growing and I can't wait to see where she goes!
0679805273|2.0|Like dog owners that buy food for dogs that is more appealing from a human perspective, many of these reviewers liked this because it touches them from an adult perspective.  Not only is this not that great for children, it's not even the good Dr.'s best work.  If you don't believe me, buy it for you kid and see how they like it compared to other books.  Not very engaging for kids...Try one fish, two fish instead.
B00006JOPX|5.0|First and foremost, I am a longtime Dio fanatic, as I am sure you probably are if you're shopping for this album.  This remaster is definitely worth the money; The Last in Line has always been a masterpiece marred my poor engineering.  The 1984 issue of the album sounded great on tape, back when we didn't know any better.  The CD version? Well, what was supposed to sound dark and epic came across as weak and tinny, with all the raucous gusto of a nasal bleat.<br />This Japanese remaster of The Last in Line captures all of the mix you could almost but not quite hear before, adding some much-needed low end punch to the mix.  The opening chords of &quot;We Rock&quot; hit you with the sonic equivalent of a kick to the temple from a steel-toed work boot.  You can hear all -- and I mean ALL -- of Vivian Campbell's nuances on the guitar, from harmonics to whammy bar divebombs that were previously lost to the drums.  Jimmy Bain's bass playing comes forward in stunning clarity, yet doesn't drown out the rest of the mix.  And, of course, Vinny Appice's drumming sounds better than ever; you can tell you're listening to cymbals and not recording hiss.  Of course, bear in mind, the original tapes were done in 1983-84, and you can tell by Ronnie's vocals, but I feel that it adds a certain charm.<br />Overall, the remaster adds some badly needed air to the studio.  If you listen closely during &quot;Breathless,&quot; you can hear Vivian's amplifier hum.  You can actually distinguish what he's playing now as well, which, for a guitarist such as myself, is nigh to a religious experience.  This disc puts the spotlight back on the whole band, rather than just Ronnie.  Give it a listen, and you can see why Vivian Campbell was one of the few men who could be considered Randy Rhoads' contemporary counterpart.  A must for hardcore fans and collectors, and probably not a bad idea for a casual fan who doesn't already have the original.
0792842499|4.0|My criticism of this movie is trivial; this is a great movie, and in scope and story it is the greatest of the Western genre. It's more than a classic, it's an icon. Eli Wallach's character &quot;Tuco&quot; is probably the most interesting character in any western I can think of, and Lee van Cleef is a perfectly inscrutable villain. The filming is fantastic, and like the other Westerns of Sergio Leone, somehow these Italian-made films (also filmed in Spain) feel much more authentic than the Hollywood brand of western. The sweat, the dust, the cockroaches, the dialogue, etc. The Ennio Morricone soundtrack is phenomenal -- one of the most recognizeable soundtracks ever made.<br />The only flaws I find in this film have to do with the production. Leone had a much larger budget to film this one than he did for the others in the &quot;Clint Trilogy&quot; and in some parts the money overtakes the film and gives it a slicker feel than, say, the grittiness of &quot;A Fistful of Dollars.&quot; Clint trades in his run-down pancho for a pricy-looking duster, and the rebel choir (in the cavalry scenes) is overorchestrated (sounds recorded in an orchestra pit). Little details like that tend to intrude with a Hollywood feel now and then. <br />Not to say that Leone wasted his big budget. The Civil War scenes are great, the ending is tremendous, and scant a wasted moment in this nearly 4-hour film. Among Spaghetti Westerns I rank this film second to &quot;A Fistful of Dollars,&quot; but honestly the best Spaghetti Western is whichever one you happen to be watching.<br />Trivia note: Leone plants a clue in this film to tell us it is a &quot;prequel&quot; to the other two &quot;Dollar&quot; movies, even though it was filmed after the other two. Look for the clue after the Civil War &quot;bridge&quot; scene...
B000050FEN|5.0|David Fincher's suspenseful and gritty thriller grips you, leaving you speechless and pondering once the end credits have finished rolling, even while watching the supplements. With its dark and morbid atmosphere and the uncompromising down-beat ending it will leave you thinking about what just sped by you. Harsh and real, &quot;Se7en&quot; is a homicide thriller that will keep you on the edge of your seat for its entire running length, and it will not fail to impress its disturbing mood upon you, sending shivers and chills down your spine.<br />Brad Pitt and Morgan Freeman play as a pair of homicide detectives on a quest to solve a mysterious series of murders. Lt. Somerset (Freeman) is a burnt-out veteran cop on the brink of his retirement when he is teamed up with his replacement, an ambitious and fervent Brad Pitt as Detective David Mills. Two worlds collide as they struggle to accept each other even as a serial killer haunts the streets of this unnamed city, taking upon himself the burden of the Hand of God. He commits various creative punishments on people he feels exemplify the nature of the seven deadly sins. It takes all of the detectives' experience and effort to track the bloody trail of John Doe (Kevin Spacey), who in turn enjoys toying with the cops, planting clues as part of his deadly vision.<br />Fincher's world is dark, gray and foreboding through most of the movie and destroys any hope you might have for this urban civilization. Even the opening credits are murky, jerky, near-subliminally interspersed with disturbing crime-scene photos. Drenching rain is falling from depressingly cloudy gray skies for most of the movie, underscoring the unhealthy and fatalistic nature of this picture. &quot;Se7en's&quot; claustrophobic urban world rustles with cockroaches, and is filled with piles of rotten junk to the point that you can almost smell the putrid air. When the scenes begin to brighten and we finally move into broad daylight, it is only for the most gripping climax suspense cinema has seen in a long time, in a counterpoint revealing the abominable abyss of the dark and masochistic soul of the killer.
B00009V7T2|5.0|It could be an ongoing argument as if someone actually LIKES Mars Volta or not, but there's no doubt about it...they have talent. It did take me a few listens to get hooked, but believe me. It's better to listen to the whole album through than pick out seperate songs. It kind of sets a mood. I would call this style &quot;experimental hard rock with latin influences,&quot; if i were to call it something.<br />Favorite songs: Drunkship, Cicatriz Esp, and Inertiatic Esp<br />p.s. i have no clue what half the words in the songs mean...same goes with ATDI...
B00005JKC3|3.0|For fans of the HULK in all of his incarnations, this film cannot be the best thing ever, because of reasons I want to suggest here.  I rented this after missing it in the theaters so maybe I am missing the big screen experience, but here are my thoughts after watching the film and the extras.  If you havent seen it, then don't read this review.  there are some spoilers (I do think fans should see it, but I also was disappointed) so stop here if you do not want the experience ruined for you.<br />Okay, first we have the origin story.  What made the Hulk's origin so moving is the desperation of the test with the &quot;gamma bomb&quot; and Bruce Banner saving Rick Jones, and sacrificing himself to the bomb's rays.  Here in the film, we have a pseudo-scientific update using &quot;nanomeds&quot; bathed in gamma rays that Bruce already possessed due to his Dr. Frankenstein-like father (Nick Nolte, I will say more about him later).  I have problems with that because why complicate the issue by making another prior origin to the event that transforms Bruce into the Hulk?  It becomes anti-climactic when Bruce is sacrificing himself in the movie.  I may incite arguments from people who loved the film, but really think about it.  Why have his transformation be a two step process? Unless the father/son thing was the impetus for the whole film (which it should NOT have been).  It is true that Peter David has psychoanalyzed Banner in the comics, and it is entertaining to a degree, but to make Bruce and his hulkness a product of his father's tampering, is to change the origin completely!  The tragedy of the Hulk (presented in HULK #1 by JACK KIRBY (shame on the filmmakers for not giving him more credit!) and Stan &quot;the man&quot; Lee) is that it is an accident, that happens to a decent man who is also a genius.  No offense to Eric Bana, but the Bruce Banner in the film is basically there to become the hulk.  You do not buy into his being a genius.  He is too young. My idea of a Banner would have been Kevin Speacy, who could have played a genius, and capture the humanity of the scientist.  Bana is not bringing anything to the table, and he admits it in the 2nd disc.<br />The other thing that I noticed was the misuse of Nick Nolte as the father.  What could have worked were flashbacks to Bruce's childhood and maybe the intro of the anger issues.  But to use the father as the villain is (I'm sorry) stupid.  What made spider man such a success is that the origin story is straightforward, the villain intense, and the tragedy inherent.  HULK is the opposite.  The story is convoluted, the villain nonexistent (the army was always just a 3rd party that hunted the hulk. They do not qualify as &quot;villains&quot;.  They are just &quot;puny humans&quot;. Again, Nick Nolte as the final &quot;showdown villain&quot; makes no sense, even as we have been given his sort of backstory of madness and being locked up for 30 years (?) except maybe to show off some special effects) and the tragedy is less powerful than it could have been because of these things.  Why not have a pure villain? (The Leader, for instance, the REAL absorbing man, or even The Abomination) The film would have been SO much better if the origin was relegated to the first 30 minutes (like Parker's in Spider man) and the rest of the film the plight of the monster, but I guess I am just wishing for things here. For a 2 1/2 hour film, the editing did not speed up the process of telling the story at all, even with the split screening.<br /><br />I want to say something good about the film, and this is because I love comics.  It does try very hard to be a serious drama and succeeds in that you do not laugh at all. They gave HULK the big budget treatment, with a hot current director.  The music is intense from Danny Elfman, and worthy of praise.  It is an emotional film to a degree, but it is so bleak that you feel drained after watching it.  I compare it to Spider man, because Sam Raimi treated spider man seriously, but he kept the element of FUN and ADVENTURE that fans loved.

B00009UW0N|5.0|There are certainly horror films more gory than Halloween, but I have yet to find one that exceeds it in giving the viewer a relentless level of tension.<br />It almost does a disservice to the movie to watch it on a television because that level of tension best comes out when the movie is seen on a theater screen.  I saw the movie at the theater when it was first released.  I can't remember the number of times I was jolted in the theater seat by this movie.  I enjoyed the scares so thoroughly that I remained for a second showing, and I made sure to watch the audience's reaction during the scary parts that I knew were about to come up.<br />Donald Pleasance is wonderful as the relentless Dr. Sam Loomis, a man who spent more than a decade trying to reach &quot;The Shape,&quot; also known as Michael Myers, who, as a child, was committed to an maximum security hospital after murdering his sister on Halloween night when he was but six years old.  Loomis came to know Myers very well even though the child never spoke to him.  In his words... &quot;The darkest eyes.  The devil's eyes.&quot;<br />One night, Myers decides he has had enough of prison life and he escapes (a VERY scary scene).  It's back to his hometown of Haddonfield and...you guessed it...it's Halloween again.<br />Jamie Lee Custis is excellent in role of Laurie, a teenage bookworm/wallflower who is eventually hunted by Myers.  She just needs to learn not to drop a knife.<br />As the official review says, this is a pretty bloodless horror movie.  Believe me, that in no way degrades it's quality.  With Myers moving in and out of the background (lurking) to build the tension, you don't need a lot of blood.<br />John Carpenter's musical theme for the movie is a classic, and it certainly adds to the tension in the scenes.  Solid writing, directing, and acting.  It's a shame they felt it necessary to make sequels.
B00005JKED|4.0|Rookie cop Jake Hoyt wants to stop crooks, not become one. But staying on the right side of the line that separates cop from criminal will be more challenging than anything he's faced. Because Hoyt's senior partner for the next 24 hours is Alonzo Harris, an undercover narc meaner than any of L.A.'s mean streets.<br />In a powerful departure from his frequent good-guy roles, Denzel Washington plays Harris, the twisted but charismatic detective who both attracts and repels as he becomes the kind of thug he's supposed to collar. Ethan Hawke plays unseasoned recruit Hoyt. And Antoine Fuqua (The Replacement Killers, Bait) directs, guiding a cast that includes music stars Dr. Dre, Macy Gray and Snoop Dogg. Training Day. It's a day of reckoning.

6300185311|5.0|This is the third film with the teaming of Doris Day, Rock Hudson and Tony Randall.  The first was [[ASIN:B001TKUXVQ Pillow Talk]] (1959) and then [[ASIN:B0001CNRB6 Lover Come Back]](1961).  This time Doris and Rock play a married couple living in a nice, quiet residential neighborhood (Universal lot, now known as \\"Wisteria Lane\\" of Desperate Housewives tv series).  Tony Randall is the next door neighbor.  Rock is a hypochondriac and he dreams in 1950's television commercial style.  The wide medicine cabinet in the bathroom is just full of what ever could cure him.  Meanwhile, Doris is outside in her bathrobe to get the morning newspaper.  Ernie the Milkman (Dave Willock) runs up to Doris with the delivery and some town gossip to go with it.  But wouldn't you know it, Doris gets stuck outside in her bathrobe.  She yells for \\"George\\", but he is in the shower.  Now getting around to the other side of the house is another matter.  Naturally, she does not want to be seen, but the young man, Vito (Clive Clerk), the dry cleaners delivery man, sees her and boy does he whistle at her.    Hal March  plays his usual ladies man role.  You may remember him from [[ASIN:B000ANE9LI The George Burns & Gracie Allen Show, Vol. 1]] (1950) and a couple \\"I Love Lucy\\" episodes.    Edward Andrews plays \\"Ralph\\", Rock's doctor.  Rock overhears his doctor talking on the phone to another doctor.  Rock thinks the doctor is talking about him, that he only has a couple weeks left to live.    Paul Lynde is in an unforgettable role as the cemetary plot salesman of Green Hills Cemetary.  Tony Randall is cute as Rock's concerned, emotional and sometimes drunk friend.    What a fun movie to watch.
B00005JMJ4|2.0|Let's see: <br />A female lead who is far too young (and indecisive by nature) for anyone to actually believe she's married (let alone for 2 years and to a dude she obviously can't stand)... a male lead who's been married for 25 years, yet has a young son and a baby daughter... a female lead who is, essentially, a blob... a male lead whom we are supposed to care about, despite the fact that he forgets his son's birthday and describes having children as if it's the worst thing that will ever happen to you... the requisite contrived, nagging wifey back home... a female lead who seems to be alone and lost in a foreign city she's never been to, yet suddenly half way through the film has close friends who barely speak her language and are middle-aged... a male lead who apparently, and with no explanation, has ESP (how else would he know which room she was staying in when she invites him to go out on the town with her?)... oh, and don't forget to add some borderline racism and one joke over and over about how Japanese people switch their \\"R's\\" and \\"L's\\" in place of actual humor...<br />...And then there's the [INAUDIBLE WHISPER] at the end, which proves once and for all that the inablilty to give a movie a satisfying ending is contagious (thanks a lot, Spike!). <br />Come to think of it, being outrageously over-rated must be genetic (well, OK, Francis did make two great films-- Godfather I and II). <br />Two stars for the cinematography and acting, which were great. Minus three stars for the lack of anything else. Next time, write a script, Sophia, not just a hackneyed collection of plot holes without a plot.
0743455967|5.0|Any writer and/or Stephen King reader must read this book. It's a terrific insight to King's past, his mind, and his works. King starts by telling us colorful stories of his childhood and lets us follow his career path toward being the most prolific writer of today.<br />His memoirs aren't all cheer and blossom, in fact, they are often a bit dark, much like his fiction. Even the style of &quot;On Writing&quot; takes a dark turn around the middle, written around the time he was run over by a van.<br />He admits his weaknesses in this book and tells us of a time when he was suffering from addiction and how it was his wife, Tabitha, that pushed him to overcome the addiction to become an even better writer. In fact, it was Tabitha that could be credited for his first great success as a writer, &quot;Carrie.&quot; If it weren't for her, the book may have never been published. That's another part of King's story, documented in &quot;On Writing.&quot;<br />If you're only a intermittent King fan and just get into his books for the horror factor, this book probably isn't for you. However, if you want to be a successful writer, or if you just want to know what is behind the King, I would recommend this book. In fact, I loaned my extra copy to a friend and never got it back. Hey Tiff, please return it.

B00003CWL6|5.0|~~~I have a dysfunctional family.  My mother is a crazed realtor who's failure only leads to an affair.  She never talks to me anymore, probably because she only cares about her career.  She and my dad fight more often now.  My dad is...I don't know what my dad is.  He quit his job technically, but I guess he conned his way into getting paid without working.  We used to be really good, but not anymore.  He's obsessed with my friend, Angela. She's a cheerleader at our high school.  She thinks she's so sexy and brags about all the people she's slept with.  She even wants to sleep with my dad, which I think is gross.  My dad knows this and is working out like mad just for her.  Pft.  Ricky Fates...that's my new neighbor.  He is a strange boy that goes to school and walks around with a video camera taping dead birds.  His father abuses him and is pro nazi.  I think I like Ricky.  Lately, I've been talking to him more.  He is...beautiful.....Oh, and me?  I am just an ordinary girl who's depressed.  I hate my parents because everything they do is for themselves.  They pretend to love me.  And as you can see, my life is not exactly the best........~~~<br />  That is the what life would be like in the shoes of Jane Burnham, who's life she believes to be one of the worst.  Portrayed by Thora Birch, Jane is not your typical \\"hot\\" chick you're used to seeing in high budget films.  Of course, she is not ugly either.  Perhaps...beautiful?  So says Ricky Fitts (Wes Bentley), who is the boy with the camera next door.  He likes to tape \\"beautiful\\" things, and has a strong interest in Jane.<br />Now Jane's friend, Angela Hayes (Mena Suvari) is your stereotypical cheerleader--a little snotty, a little popular, attractive, and blonde.  Her physical features is what drives Lester Burnham, who narrates the film from underneath the tombstone.  Feeling the adversities of his marriage, job, and family relations, Lester feels dead.  It takes a scent to wake him up from his slumber and live again....a certain scent.....a rose perhaps.....Angela..........<br /><br />  This film is about beauty.  It is about stereotypes and judegements.  The stereotypical features that are shown from the outside that are not always true.  In fact, they are far from true.  An ordinary girl may not be as ordinary as you think.  The strange freak with the camera who just got out of a mental house may not be such a freak afterall.  The typical blonde cheerleader may not be as sexually active as perceived.  And the seemingly ordinary parents are soon to be discovered as not quite so ordinary.  The only beauty in life does not come from all the sunsets, sunrises, snowy mountaintops, the accentuating blue sky, or the glow of the silver moon surrounded by millions of specks in the everlasting sky.  Perhaps beauty can be sought out within a dead bird?  A plastic bag?<br />  In this heavy movie which contains a bit of sex, drugs, money, power, and discrimination--all themes of drama--director Sam Mendes delivers a powerful, dramatic, yet comedic tale of America's beauty.  He defines America not as a wealthy country with independence and refinement.  Rather than depicting the Eagle that symbolizes America, he defines it with the Turkey--the actual symbol Benjamin Frankilm wanted as the Nation's bird.  Why?  Because turkeys are humble.  America is humble.  That is where our beauty lies.<br />  Mendes perfects this rendition of America with the help of cinematographer, Conrad Hall, and Thomas Newman with the musical score (Also did score for Shawshank Redemption).  Both played an important role to depicting the film's thesis.  The cinematography was tender, yet vivid in the most simplest sense.  My favorite shot was of the raindrops falling.  Watch and you'll see.  The music was mesmerizing....nothing more to say but great.  5-star movie, especially for those who rate films on high standards (more than just acting and plot).  This film was deep, comedic, sexy, romantic in an absurd way, and dramatic.  If you are looking for a hilarious comedy or something to lighten your mood, this one may not be the wisest of choices if you're not into deep drama.d way, and dramatic.

0451196716|5.0|&quot;The Long Walk&quot; is my favorite novel by Stephen King. Considering he's my favorite author and I've been devouring his work since I was a wee lass of 10, that's saying a lot. <br />It's not exactly classic horror. The horror is mostly in the psychology, rather than in the words themselves. It takes place in the future or perhaps in a parallel world. Much like in &quot;The Running Man,&quot; games are played for all to watch. However, in these games the losers die. <br />Eerily like the current reality based game shows, &quot;The Long Walk&quot; is about a contest played by young men in their teens. They consider themselves to be lucky to be chosen to compete. The winner receives fame, fortune, their hearts desire. <br />The concept of the game is to just walk. The 100 contestants walk, and walk, and walk... if one fails to walk, he gets a warning. If he gets 3 warnings, well, he gets his &quot;ticket&quot; and is out of the game. The last remaining &quot;survivor&quot; wins the game. <br />The game is televised and is watched by nearly everyone. People look forward to this game every year and show up alongside the streets where the boys walk to cheer for their favorite contender. <br />You might think it's boring, one book about a bunch of boys and all they do is walk, or don't walk as the case may be. While they walk, they talk. They talk about their deepest desires, their reasons for walking, their relatives, everything except, in most cases, what happens if they don't happen to win. <BR>I read this book for the first time several years ago. I recommend it to everyone and keep going back to reread it time and again. <br />Pick this one up. You won't be sorry.
B00005JME0|5.0|This movie definitely falls within my top five movies. It has a unique and interesting story line that revolves around the butterfly effect theory. I have to say that Ashton Kutcher pulled the part off very well. I was extremely impressed with his acting and his venture into the drama world. Anyone who says that Ashton cannot be taken seriously in this movie obviously didnt watch the same movie that I did. I think that I can honestly say that fter seeing this movie, Ashton is better fit for drama than he is the comedy roles he has been so generally type-cast with. This is a dark, intense movie that really leaves you thinking after it is over. Great ending as well! 5 stars all the way!
B00006BTCA|5.0|It has been a long time since I've heard a CD that actually made me excited about something.  This is it. <br />Interpol is an interesting mix of some of the darkest bands of the late '70s and '80s.  There are strains of Bauhaus, The Church, and even David Bowie that come through in this band.  Although at times it sounds like this New York band is aping '80s British goth rock, it works really well. <br />Favorite tracks:  Obstacle 1 and PDA.
0553296981|5.0|This is a fascinating book for one major reason: it's not the one you read in sixth grade.  For years this book has been known as \\"The Diary of a Young Girl.\\"  Otto Frank's influence on the book released in 1947 should not be underestimated.  How many fathers cope with their daughters' maturing into adults comfortably?  What one realizes when reading this edition is the real title should have been \\"Diary of a Young Woman.\\"<br />This is a much more vibrant reading experience than the first edition released. I think it's mentioned in the foreword that she started writing the diary for personal reasons, but eventually hoped to publish it after the war.  What one realizes is how important Anne Frank would have become had she lived.  It's not an overstatement to say she was talented beyond her years.  She is one of the most important authors of the twentieth century as it is, because this book says a great deal about the twentieth century.  But had she lived, I think we would have seen even greater books come out of her.<br />If you have never read this book, this is the edition to get.

B0000DD7LB|4.0|I am only 18, but I've got two kids. Having two kids makes it hard to enjoy much of my life. I spend most of my day delivering newspapers. It doesn't get me down because I put this CD in my walkman and blast it as loud as it will go. This CD heals all my internal wounds as well as the wounds I usually inflict on my arms and chest with knives and forks. Without this CD, I don't know how I'd cope with my fate. My children are too young to understand how great it is, but I make them listen to it anyway. I play it at all times through the baby monitor. When they sleep, I put it on their headphones and play it real soft. Sometimes it makes them cry, but that's fine because it makes me cry sometimes too. It's a good cry. A release. Anyway, I'm dating this new guy and he's kind of hairy. He hates this CD and says it's not &quot;Metal enough.&quot; I'm definitely thinking of dumping him just because he doesn't like this CD. His name is Pat. He buys me milk and potatoes sometimes. So, I'm still undecided on what I'll do. I love this CD though. It gets me in the Zone.
B000000WF0|2.0|Three or four songs aside (\\"Bittersweet Symphony\\", \\"Sonnet\\", \\"Lucky Man\\" and little else), this record is just a highly disappointing, average, bland and overrated product. It`s hard to believe that critics chose this as one of the best albums of the nineties, since it sounds terribly dated and it wasn`t all that innovative and edgier by the time it came out anyway. <BR>\\"Urban Hymns\\" is britpop by-the-numbers, a combo of predictable and forgettable songs that rarely surpass the safe territory. Richard Ashcroft isn`t a great singer, his voice range is limited and the melodies of most of the compositions sound almost the same. The lyrics go from typical romance situations to that \\"I`m so special and strange, but nobody understands me\\" attitude. So, there`s nothing really new or interesting to find here, it`s just another listenable yet unsurprising rock record. <BR>There are much better hymns out there.

0440237688|3.0|When I read The Giver I was a little confused in the begining. This book is about a young boy who is given the chance to take over a very important role in his community. He learns a lot from his experience and decides to make a very important decision. I would recomend this book to anyone who enjoys sci-fi or fictional type of stories. I didn't enjoy this book as much as I would a more kind of sci-fi horror type of book. I do like fiction but not this kind of fiction. To me this kind of fiction is unrealistic and kind of immature. Some parts of this book did suprise me and the book does kind of keep you on your feet wondering what is going to happen next but I do have to say that this was not a favorite of mine but might be for someone else.
0792151712|3.0|When I saw this movie on the big screen, I was overcome with emotion and the images of the catastrophic fate of the largest oceanliner in its time haunted me for days. <br />Unfortunately, this movie lost its charm and appeal quickly.  The video is nothing compared to the big screen.  The grandness, both of the magnificent ship and of its horrendous destruction, are lost when viewed on the TV.<br />While this film made Leonardo DiCaprio a household name (and somewhat of a pre-teen idol to be mocked by most adults), he has played far more challenging roles in What's Eating Gilbert Grape and The Man in the Iron Mask.  Kate Winslet looked stunning and gave her character semi-believable growth and development throughout the film.<br />What is most striking about this film, especially when viewed on video, is the very apparent break between love story and disaster drama.  The first video literally ends when the two young lovers come together and face the adversaries of their relationship.  The second tape is almost entirely about the sinking of the great ship Titanic.  It is filled with incredible struggle and pain, fear and intense love.  In one incredibly striking scene, a mother holds her children in bed and tells them a story as they drift off to sleep - and their watery grave.<br />This film rates 3 stars in my book - no more because the cheesy love story is almost too much to take!  But no less either, because the tragedy and immense drama of the Titanic's fate is truly brought to life as no work as done before.
B0001AP12G|5.0|I havent really bought any cds for awhile, but this cd is definately worth it. the beats on this cd are hot and so are his rhymes. its nice to hear someone rappin about other things other then guns, hos, and ice. all the tracks on this album are solid and i can listen to it all the way through. my favorite tracks on this cd are all falls down, never let me down, family business and through the wire. go buy this cd now, its definately worth it.
B00008PW2D|3.0|Well, the shortness of the series certainly does beg the question, why did they try squeeze in Season 5 with two pregnant ladies instead of just waiting another year? In addition to the brevity, this series really isn't as strong as the previous four, and the first three episodes are unworthy of what we have come to expect from Sex in the City, or even from HBO. The jokes are forced and lewd rather than funny, and somehow the attention to detail just isn't there - which is irritating because of its unnecessary carelessness. (Two unforgivable examples: in the Atlantic City episode, Carrie goes from lanky hair in need of a cut to tight frizzy perm and back to lanky hair, and in the Christening episode, Steve's Mom holds Baby Brady so badly the viewer is almost relieved that he's obviously a doll.) But it does get better, and five of the episodes are pretty good entertainment. If you're a fan, an average of $6.50 per good episode isn't a fabulous deal, but you'll do it.  And face it, anyone who's mad about the price must have known how few episodes there were before they bought it. So here's my advice: if you're a big fan, pay the money and be quiet. If you're not, rent it.
0812550706|5.0|Peter was too hard, Val was too soft, but Ender... He was just right.  At least that was hope that Colonel Graff was literally betting the world on.  Time was running out.  Earth had twice been invaded by the \\"buggers\\" and they needed a commander capable of winning the war and saving the world.  Ender was their best choice.  The problem was that he was only 6.<br />Ender finds himself in Battle school, where the best young minds the world can gather learn the arts of war through games.  Ender can prove him self to be the best at the games, but will that be enough?   Would there be enough time for him to grow up, learn everything he needed and<BR>provide the world with a happily every after?<br />Ender's game has all the trappings of a Science Fiction book: space travel, nifty future gadgets, war between Man and alien species, but at it's heart it is a psychological drama.  The government is doing everything it can to manipulate Ender into becoming the hero commander they desperately need.  Ender is doing everything he can to win the game and survive.  He wants to live, to be loved and most of all he to keep from becoming the thing he hates most, Peter, a cold hearted killer.  Ender knows he is being manipulated, what he doesn't know is how far they will go.<br />I can see why this book was a Hugo winner.  Card manages to maintain that rare balance of perfect pace that authors strive for. The story<BR>unfolds through the eyes of Ender and we are carried along with it.  Card takes the time to develop full, interesting characters, but at the same time keeps the action and plot moving at a steady pace.  This is the first of his books that I have read, but it leaves me more than willing to pick up another.
B000003TA4|5.0|Smells Like Teen Spirit isn't Nirvana's &quot;best&quot; song.  However, I guess it was the right song at the right time with the message we needed to hear.  SO it was a breakthrough, and it has become Nirvana's &quot;anthem&quot;.  It's a good song.  But take a listen to any of Nirvana's CD's and you'll see why this is the best band you've heard.  It's real, raw, let's you explore/express all sorts of emotions, takes you to a place where you can say f***k the world,...a cleansing experience.  Awake from it with clear eyes.<br />It's quite funny how all these little boy band/punk groups with their $50 pair of &quot;distressed&quot; jeans, cute one word statement tee-shirts, and with product sculpted messy hair try to rock.  Record execs must have tapped into a formula somehwere, cause there are SO MANY of these poppy little groups coming out everywhere.  Scary...Is this what kids think good music is?<br />Listen to Nirvana, believe me they're much better, even still, than the pre-pubescent pseudo rockers out today. :D
1400034779|4.0|I thoroughly enjoyed this book - the characters, the mysteries, the clever and surprisingly non-convulated problem-solving approach by Mma to helping her customers. As a former resident of Botswana, this was nostalgic for me and a wonderful portrait of a welcoming, complex, beautiful country and its people. Hurray for something so different, so human - highly recommeded.

Bought it from Amazon and read it in 2 days I think.

B0000A118M|5.0|This is a really great album from a great artist.   It is NOT &quot;over-hyped&quot; as some people say.   To begin with Coltrane was a bebop player... and a brilliant one.   However, like most great modern artists he had to break the rules to re-write them in his own personal language ...not unlike, Miles Davis, Picasso, Frank Lloyd Wright etc.   The way he forged a personal saxaphone language was amazing and &quot;A Love Supreme&quot; is the best example of this.   However, the problem with Coltrane is that it takes a leap of faith on the part the listener to get on his wavelength.   You see, the music is reliant on it's own inner rules, not by those established by music/jazz history.   If you can make the &quot;leap of faith&quot; then the reward is well worth it, if you can't... I pity you!
0385504209|3.0|If you like John Grisham novels, then you'll like Da Vinci Code.  It moves at breakneck speed and keeps you in suspense, and it really is a good ride, but then like Grisham novels, it sorta falls apart at the end.  The unlikely turn of events in the last part of the book will leave many groaning, especially when you find out who the bad guy is and his motivations.  If you think really hard about it, it doesn't make a whole lot of sense.  But it's breezy, light reading, so just suspend your disbelief for a while and enjoy what is essentially the book version of a hollywood thriller.
B000000W5N|5.0|Where do you begin with an album of this magnitude? The truth is not only were the subjects discussed in the songs taboo but just look at the Andy Warhol designed jacket cover. The album does seem to be more cohesive than &quot;Exile&quot; and for that reason I prefer it to &quot;Exile&quot; or any of their others (except &quot;Let it Bleed&quot;). The Stones had entered a new phase by the time this album was released back in '71. Certainly elements of country and western could be heard in a song like 'Dead Flowers' which was more than likely inspired by the burgeoning relationship between Keith and alt country rock luminary, Gram Parsons. Of course there's 'Wild Horses' which for me is the best composition ever culled from the Jagger-Richards collection (barring 'Gimme Shelter&quot;). Mick Taylor....wow....his playing is graceful, precocious (he was only 21 at the time of recording) and really compliments Keith's playing throughout yet has its own, very distinct sound. His arrival was a godsend for them at the time he joined, a perfect conductor of the sound and feel they were trying to relate. The mention of drug use is a great deal more explicit than we had heard it insinuated in other early Stones albums. A song like 'Sister Morphine' still sends shivers down your spine when you listen to it. It will have the same effect for those who listen to it 30 more years from now. They also return to their pure blues roots with a remake of an old blues tune called 'You gotta move' which was reminiscent in most of what you heard on 'Beggars'. Some would argue to say which album during that prolific creative period (1968-72)for the Stones was their greatest. &quot;Let it bleed&quot; is only slightly better than &quot;Sticky&quot; but not by much. This album should have provoked an end to the Beatles sabbatical just to attempt to try to better it. The thing is only the Stones could have made this album and the point is driven home when Keith strikes that opening chord to Brown Sugar. Rock doesnt get any better than this folks. It is in a microcosm what the Stones were/are all about.
B00008H2LB|1.0|yea ill give this band some credit. i credit them and 20 million other generic bands for all sounding the same. i have listened to both cds and they are pointless and shallow. DO NOT BUY THIS CD or any other rap/nu-metal cds unless its Faith No More or Papa Roach. and whats the hold up it takes them 3 years to write about being angry? they virtualy used the same lyrics as hybrid theroy.. listen to FNM Papa Roach Rage Against The Machine Misfits Marilyn Manson or Nine INch Nails
0312319517|5.0|A true page turner!  Up to date topic, which adds to the suspense.  Unlike most books of this genre, this one has a twist at the end....whom do you pull for when it is--good vs good vs evil?  The winner makes all the difference.  <BR>The plot also has a well-placed red herring.<BR>Don't miss this one!
B000006O7C|1.0|Jeff Buckley had a great vocal range and some nice guitar work on this album, and quite a few clever lyrics, but he is such a bore. Outstanding tracks like &quot;The Sky Is A Landfill&quot; and &quot;Witches' Rave&quot; show how powerful his lyrics can be, but other tracks like &quot;Everybody Here Wants You&quot; and &quot;Your Flesh Is So Nice&quot; shows how corny, pointless, and annoying 85% of Jeff's music is.<br />His vocal range is impressive, and his upper range sounsd quite soothing and lovely, but for the most part his voice is an annoying whine, and he sounds way too desperate and helpless for an intimate relationship on his more &quot;daring and edgy&quot; songs, yet he sings such songs with no grace, elegance or fire the way Queen's outstanding Freddie Mercury did when HE sang a dirty song. He makes me laugh at how corny he is.<br />Don't waste your money. Buy a few of his singles, but skip this album. This guy has nothing new to offer you or your music collection.

B00005JKN9|5.0|Definitely a great 19th century epic movie and one of my personal favorites, Gangs of New York, brings to the screen two main stories which are unfolding simultaneously: Gang warfare in NYC between nativists and immigrants with the Civil War taking place in the background.  In addition, the movie portrays superbly and in great detail, both the corrupt politics as well as the attitudes and mentality of New Yorkers during the Civil War, thus providing insight into a very important period of US History. There is one scene in particular in which newly arrived Irishmen are getting off the ship that brought them to &quot;paradise&quot; (America) only to be drafted within minutes into the Federal Army in order to be sent down south to fight against the Confederacy.  A great movie indeed which shatters several misconceptions, deliberate and not, surrounding northern attitudes towards the Civil War and the Emancipation Proclamation i.e. northerners were anti-slavery and yet very racist, something which is difficult for people today to comprehend, and the fact that most northerners did not want to keep the southerners part of a country that they did not want to be part of, (needless to say going to war was not even an option for the average northerner and they had to be forced to sign up).  Lincoln's decision to order the bombardment of the Northern &quot;jewel&quot; city of NY by the US Navy in order to put down the NYC Draft Riots also provides for historical truths which had been suppressed for long years in the name of &quot;patriotism&quot;...

0800141601|5.0|A truly great epic movie and one of my personal favorites, First Knight, brings to the screen the tale of King Arthur of Camelot, Lady Guinevere, Sir Lancelot and the likes.  Sean Connery, Julia Ormond, and Richard Gere, whose performances are outstanding, make this movie one of the best of its kind. The castles, the battles and the costumes are all wonderful!<BR>First Knight is a movie about honor, bravery, and heroes from a time long gone. <BR>A great movie indeed!!!
B00005V9HA|5.0|WARNING! THIS REVIEW IS ONE BIG, NASTY SPOILER! > Strange things are happening at Miskatonic Medical school. All was well until Herbert West (Jeffrey Combs) showed up. He is an odd looking / odder acting man with insane ideas about re-animating the dead. West moves in with med student Dan Cain (Bruce Abbott) and his cat, Rufus. Unbeknownst to Dan, West is conducting his unholy experiments in the basement. One night, Dan's girlfriend Megan (Barbara \\"Where are my clothes?\\" Crampton) notices that Rufus is missing. She finds him in West's refrigerator, looking like a road-kill sandwich. Later that night, Dan is awakened by sounds that still drop my body temperature when I recall them! Hideous howls and screeches ring throughout the house. Dan grabs a baseball bat and investigates, only to find West in his basement laboratory, battling a re-animated and VERY ticked-off Rufus! With Dan's help, Rufus is vanquished, and used to redecorate the walls. West re-animates the poor feline a second time with his glowing, green \\"re-agent\\" serum to prove to Dan that he means business (or, that he really hates cats). Dan is forced to help Herbert when he threatens to tell the dean (Robert Sampson) that Dan is sleeping with his daughter. One thing leads to another, and the diabolical duo end up in the morgue, re-animating a cadaver. Learning nothing from the Rufus fiasco, our heroes get thrown around the room by a convulsing, zombified madman! Dean Halsey shows up and gets himself squished, leading to his own re-animation. Herbert makes up a story about the dean attacking them for no apparent reason. Convinced he's gone nuts, the dean is put under the care of Dr. Hill (David Gale), a brilliant, slimeball of a brain-surgeon, who keeps Halsey locked up in his office for \\"observation\\" and lobotomizes him. Hill figures things out and decides to steal West's ideas for himself. Extremely bad choice! West beheads Hill with a coal shovel and re-animates both his head and body separately. Hillwakes up, his head in a pan. He controls his body from across the room and knocks West out. Hill goes back to his office and releases the dean, who kidnaps his daughter for him. You see, Dr. Hill has sick desires for Megan and plans to bring them into reality, regardless of his decapitated condition! This leads to the gooey, gloppy climax in the morgue. Loads of nudity, raspberry jam, and slithering rubber entrails abound. RE-ANIMATOR is not recommended for viewing while eating lasagna or spaghetti & meatballs. A must-own mad scientist / zombie / dark humor classic...
B000003TA4|4.0|Though Kurt Cobain publicly repudiated this album as sounding &quot;too slick&quot; and being overproduced, &quot;Nevermind&quot; has held up very well over the past twelve or so years that it first invaded everybody's collective conscience. &quot;Nevermind&quot; is a great album and came out at a time when &quot;real&quot; rock music was needed in the mainstream, but the band did make better albums than this. This is a good starting point, but to really understand Cobain's art, check out &quot;In Utero&quot; with all of its virulent guitar sounds and sheets of white noise juxtaposed against beautiful pop melodies. &quot;Bleach&quot; is also a killer record--more on the poppier side of things, but great nonetheless. While most of the first half of &quot;Nevermind&quot; was chock with hits, the second half is even better. Songs like &quot;Territorial Pissings&quot; and &quot;Drain You&quot; are just as effective as &quot;Come As You Are&quot; or &quot;Lithium.&quot;
B00013PHGS|5.0|I received this album as a belated Christmas gift a few weeks back. I popped it into the player in my car on a rainy Sunday afternoon while running errands and soon found myself circling the neighborhood absorbing this musical masterpiece. Long ago I lost my Moon Safari CD, and had not listened to Air in quite some time. This CD is original, bold, and eclectic, but it all connects together perfectly. I dare say that I like this better than Moon Safari in many ways. Its a little more &quot;cold&quot; and &quot;experimental&quot; on the outset but after repeated listens the warmth and beauty starts to surface. This and Rufus Wainwright's Want One are two of the best albums of the past 6 months. <br />Highlights for me are Run, Mike Mills (one of the most beautiful instrumentals ever!), Surfing on A Rocket, and Biological. The instrumental from Lost In Translation is wonderful as well. The only weak track on this album is Another Day. I hope I will not have to wait so long for new material from Air next time around as this album shows they have much more sonic territory left to explore.

0451452739|4.0|For most sci-fi fans, it is impossible to read Clarke's novelization of \\"2001\\" without calling up scenes from Kubrick's movie. Unlike nearly all books inspired by movies, however, many readers will find that Clarke's fiction enriches, rather than retreads, familiar ground. In particular, the novel more fully explains the purpose of the monoliths and the movie's ambiguous--and to many, bizarre--ending.<br />Those who complain about the book's datedness win the argument on purely literal grounds. The year 2001 has come and gone, and many of the \\"advances\\" in the book (and the movie) seem quaint, while humanity's adventures in space have, for the most part, stalled.<br />Nevertheless, what is remarkable about Clarke's book is not the technology, which was doomed to obsolescence within a decade, but rather the science. Reading \\"2001\\" reminds us that, while our industrial innovations may have departed from the expectations of the late 1960s, the principles on which our technology is based and the astrophysics that informs our worldview have altered relatively little. Indeed, the novel in many spots reads like a science book, and this impression is underscored by Clarke's journalese, which ranges from informative to didactic. (\\"It was true that the Special Theory of Relativity had proved to be remarkably durable.\\" \\"That pinpoint of incandescence must be a White Dwarf--one of those strange, fierce little stars, no larger than the Earth, yet containing millions of times its mass.\\")<br />Even the attempts at characterization are reportorial: \\"Like all his colleagues, Bowman was unmarried; it was not fair to send family men on a mission of such duration.\\" Heywood Floyd, David Bowman, and even Hal (the mutinous computer) are inarguably one-dimensional. Yet, none of this seems inappropriate, since Clarke--and Kubrick--clearly decided to forego traditional features of storytelling (character, plot, etc.) in favor of pure, extravagant speculation. Instead, Clarke has fully developed his true protagonists: science as a discipline and human progress as a whole.loped his true protagonists: science as a discipline and human progress as a whole.
B000002TQV|5.0|Possibly my favorite Radiohead album. <br />Best Songs - High &amp; Dry, Fake Plastic Trees, My Iron Lung, Sulk, Street Spirit (Fade Out)<br />Worst Songs - Planet Telex, Bullet Proof.. I Wish I Was
0767802470|5.0|Das Boot is a very impressive and very, very intense study of human nature in a time of unrelenting, merciless stresses.<br />The generally somewhat quiet yet clearly very deeply intense experienced captain plays well against the crew of boys turning into old men under the stress of their optimistic \\"of course we'll win, let's do it!\\" spirit being dumped to the bottom of the sea via plentiful, capable and merciless British destroyers unchecked by any significant U-boat support.<br />I've seen \\"Run Silent, Run Deep\\", \\"K-19\\", \\"U-571\\" and \\"The Hunt for the Red October\\", and without insulting those admirable works I do have to say the deep intensity, sheer tension and realism of Das Boot remains unparalleled.<br />The characters of Das Boot come across as truly real humans reacting as real humans would to, say, living jammed together in a rather small, unventilated, frequently attacked semi-fragile pipe for months on end often surrounded by possibly excessive water depth pressures, which pretty much sums up the environment for most of the film.  One truly, genuinely wants to use the between-discs intermission (yes, it's that long, but it's worth it) to simply breathe and verify that yes, there are lovely trees and possibly bright natural light right outside the window, but you know that would interrupt the film's intensity.<br />The ending is highly ironic and completely appropriate for anyone familiar with modern German views of war.  As with any modern German film, it is an effective demonstration of the tragic folly of seemingly unending war.<br />An English-language track is on the American market DVD (along with the original German), and almost entirely original actors did the English overdubs.  The mouth movements correspond quite well actually to the English-language overdubs, which along with its being such a quality overdub means you could be persuaded it was originally filmed in English.<br />For a study of humans under way too much tension for way too long, Idon't think it can be beat.
B00002MZ4V|5.0|Hi....John Williams deserves a place in every CD collection around the world.

As the songs my mother sang to make me sleep, his songs are part of my chilhood.
B00003CXE7|4.0|I was very impressed by Ridley Scott's truly magnificent depiction of his vision for the film.  One can nitpick all sorts of details in the film as historically inaccurate etc., but if those details were rendered more accurately they would often actually interfere by being misinterpreted by modern audiences.  Richard Harris portrays the philosophical Emperor Marcus Aurelius very, very well; his character meshes almost perfectly with the thoughts written down in the real Marcus' excellent _Meditations_ well enough to be uncanny.  (The sole exception is essential for the film's plot.)<br />Oliver Reed is also excellent as the gritty, wizened gladiator camp operator Proximo.<br />Russell Crowe brings great force of character to Maximus, a very high-ranking Roman general with long-standing connections at the very top of the food chain so to speak, who also remains down-to-earth and sensitive enough to be personally admired by his troops.  He brings that combination of sensitivity, intelligence and able willingness to bring on extreme yet controlled force (simply and very effectively of emotion at times) to his scenes throughout the film to great effect.<br />The Germania battle scene is probably most accurate and incredible depiction of Roman war techniques the screen will see for a very long time.  Occasional suspension of disbelief is required there though; Ridley Scott is depicting a vision of a great, well-equipped but increasingly challenged superpower military in action effectively enough, so just don't nitpick some of its treatment of ballistic physics or other small details that could make you wonder.  Sit back and be impressed (and set your player to full-width widescreen).<br />The soundtrack by Hans Zimmer and Lisa Gerrard (who invented her own language of indescribable sounds specifically for emotional effect) is masterful, helping carry the action and intensity along without interruption from scene to scene.<br />The depiction of Imperial Rome was impressive overall, depicting it as somewhat more organized in layout than it actually was, again I suspect to support his depiction of &quot;the greatness of Rome&quot; for his vision of the film.  The outside views of the CGI Colosseum again be nitpicked, but it's still very impressively done and the views from center stage of the roaring crowds in the realistic, well-detailed gleaming marble interior make up for it.  Considering that the bloodsport put on in the Colosseum was put on for folks generally of little more than what we'd consider a 2nd-grade education, I won't criticize the previously WWF-compared combatant presentation style.<br />The camera work is also excellent, especially when including the touchingly done Elysian Fields scenes.<br />The outcome is not what you'd expect from a typical Hollywood lots-of-fights film, not at all.<br />Ridley Scott has set out to display the challenges faced by real people whose roots lay in a collectively held fierce desire to build something people of any time could look back at in both awe and humble respect, but who then found themselves having achieved most of that dream while also finding that realized dream half-occupied by the ever-present dark side of human nature.  He succeeds magnificently; that is what in my opinion makes it a truly great film.
B00005V331|3.0|As we know that,Venom was always categorized as a NWOBHM band along with Maiden or Leppard in early 80's. But in fact they really differ from these bands. Especially with their music and their image.Also they highly influenced some bands like Metallica,Slayer and Death. Lars Ulrich(Metallica's drummer) said that \\"Welcome to Hell\\" was the first album that started the thrash metal genre.I think this is true because with its brutal sound this album is a basis for both black,thrash,speed and death metal(but mostly black metal).Also their sound is like NWOBHM but their satanic image like Black Sabbath makes it more black metal.(Of course much more satanic than Sabbath!!).Also there were some NWOBHM bands who used satanic symbols like Angel Witch,Satan,Witchfynde.But their music was classic metal so Venom was unique in their sound. Because they are more brutal.Anyway, I think this album is quite nice but the production of the album is really terrible! Maybe they recorded this album within 7 days or something?? Also vocals of Cronos is really bad but this vocal style influenced many black metal vocalists.Another weak point with this album is Mantas' strange guitar sound. In fact he is playing easy riffs but you cannot understand what he is playing with his guitar because of bad production. Despite these negative sides, \\"Welcome to hell\\" has very good classics in it like, \\"Welcome to Hell\\", \\"Poison\\", \\"Sons of Satan\\", \\"Live like an angel\\"(sounds closer to Saxon) and the magnificent \\"Schizo\\". So as a general review this album is a distorted and brutal NWOBHM album(or we can say that it is a distorted version of Saxon or Def Leppard) and their satanic influences from Sabbath makes it the first black metal album ever. Really I hate black metal and this is the only black metal CD that have but this is a really classic!!!!!!
B0001AP12G|5.0|I was very surprised on how cohesive and good this record is. This is the best record of 2004 so far and could've ranked w/ Jay and Outkast as the best of 2003.

I can't wait for the next. <br /> Best Songs:<BR>1. Jesus Walks<BR>2. School Spirit<BR>3. Never Let Me Down<BR>4. All Falls Down<BR>5. Spaceship<BR>6. Get'em High
B00018D44U|3.0|I think Norah Jones has enormous talent and I look forward to her future endeavors. On this CD, however, while I find the quality of her voice to be enthralling, she seems to have trouble staying in tune. She just sounds flat. I was impressed with her art but disappointed in her singing.

B00006F7S4|5.0|...when you can listen to this album?  I'm new to Beck which means I'm only familiar w/his hits, and songs like \\"Loser\\" never appealed to me much beyond their ironic message.    I used to blow him off.  Until I saw him perform \\"Lost Cause\\" on Letterman in '03 and proceeded to buy this album.  So my point is: get it.  It's timeless and therapeutic, one of the best albums ever produced.
B00005KB9W|5.0|There is something both magic and tragic about live recordings.  The magic is that a performance is captured and bottled for future generations to experience. What's tragic, is that those future generations are only offered a small part of the live experience.  The pallet is only whetted just enough to make the listener say \\"I wish I had been there to see it and hear it-to feel it FOR REAL.\\"<br /> Bob Marley and the Wailers Live! is one of the few live albums I've heard that transcends time and is able to deliver everything but the visuals of being at a live Marley performance.  According to the recording, Marley and company were one hell of a live act.  Every track bounces and grooves.  All of the songs are classic live album fare-in that they're long, extended jams of Marley's best hits.  Unlike most bands, however, these jams are listenable and welcomed.  \\"No Woman, No Cry\\" and \\"Get Up, Stand Up\\" soar with a sonic majesty most other artists cannot achieve in the studio, let alone live on stage.<br /> Live! takes no time in getting the vibes going, \\"Trenchtown Rock\\" opens the set, in it Marley pretty much sets the stage for the rest of the album singing \\"One good thing about music, when it hits you feel no pain.\\" Indeed.  The lyrics are powerful and yet at the same time very simple.  Every word uttered, but Marley or his backup singers, is delivered with much honesty.  A healthy mix of songs-love, feeling good, and politics permeate throughout.  All the things Marley was (and still is) are represented equally.<br /> Upon the third (or was it the fourth?) listen, I began to more fully appreciate the album's musicianship.  The bass is kickin' and the organ hums beautifully.  But best yet...the guitars are funky. Everyone on the recording is the same caliber as Marley and should be commended for helping to create not only one of the greatest live albums of all times...but also one of the greatest albums of all time.  Marley may be many things to many people, but Live! proves beyond a shadow of a doubt that Marley was, at the end of the day, a Rock Star and the King of Reggae.  This should be required listening for anyone wanting to write, perform, or listen to any kind of music.proves beyond a shadow of a doubt that Marley was, at the end of the day, a Rock Star and the King of Reggae.

B00001NFCY|4.0|This album should be a clear indication that this is not a grunge album.  It has inspiring lyrics music that motivates you all in positive ways, as far being depressing and pschologically damaging I'll leave that to the grunge era in general.  I won't pin point but didn't Creed come out of the warm south and 90% of grunge or crap comeout of the dreary pacific northwest.  To say positive and inspiring music is less credible than depressing serious music I think is a crock. Personally the glam metal scene of the eighties was more real than the flanel wearing depression of the pacific northwest.  CREED WILL LAST LONGER BECAUSE THEY HAVE A POSITIVE MESSAGE.
B00007E8V4|1.0|I am aware that System of a Down is not to be taken too seriously. Whether you like it or not, these drug-induced baddies don't exactly make the grade. The problem is that they're basically yesterday's news. Let me begin by presenting the facts. Their first, self-titled album, was extremely fresh and very gratifying. Their second album, Toxicity, was quite ambitious, and very good, but as it slowly leaked into the mainstream it became extremely watered down and lifeless.<br />This album, however, is nothing but pure nonsense. What were they thinking, releasing an album of all their old, unreleased songs? Its been done before, twice over. Did they think we wanted to hear more of the same thing, just making it drier and more generic as it goes? Who knows what was going through their head at the time of making this album. Music should progress forward, not slink around and stay in the same place, making it become stagnant and causing it to slowly wilt away. This album is full of nothing but garbage because they know they can now get away with doing the same three-chord format because its chunky and heavy while the singer pelts out a few choice numbers that go to octaves higher than I'd like to think about. Yes, it was original and cool back in the days of S/T but now to release the songs that didn't even make it on to Toxicity, an already dry and sluggish album, doesn't make any sense.<br />Overall, the songs might have been cool if we hadn't heard them already on their two previous albums. Obviously they are not exactly the same, but it would achieve the same affect if they had just re-released a box-set of their two previous albums. My only guess is that they needed more money and knew that their fans would run out to buy any old garbage they would release. But why am I bothering, its not like all the nu-metal freaks won't purchase the album anyway (which proves my above theorem).
B0000640VO|5.0|I had heard alot about this movie from all the chatter just buzzing around, not to mention the really high ratings it recieved on imdb and ymdb.com. The subtitles are really nothing bad, and you get use to them in a minute. But About the movie, The movie tells the story of Amelie a girl working in a coffee shop in France. Now the depection of France is nothing like real day France, but the fictional aura of it and how beautiful everything looks is really breathtaking. Jean-Pierre Jeunet creates a fabulous display of colors mixing with that slight french carnival music playing at the appropriate times. Audrey Tautou (and her amazingly cute self) couldn't have been a better suite for the title role. Her display of facial expressions and cute top lip make this movie. As the story progresses Amelie finds a box containing memory's of a man's child hood. And she secretly returns it to him, enlightening his life. Here, she devote herself to helping people. Through her adventure we meet Ramond DuFayel her painter friend who asks her about her life through his painting of a crowd, her being the faceless girl. Lucien, the slightly slow fruit salesmen who wants to be an artist and is harassed by his boss about it. And Amelie's father Raphael who she is trying to convince to get out and travel but he would rather stay home with his garden gnome. But in reality Amelie gets so caught up in helping others, that she forgets to help herself. That might sound kinda heavy hearted, but this story of adventure, &quot;stratagems&quot; and love couldn't be any more lighthearted. And in the end it just left me with a big smile, making me feel better than ever and brightening the day. The DVD is two disc's and loaded with extra's but I was to engulfed in the movie to even worry about them. Maybe not the greatest movie ever made, but proabably the most fun and most entertaining movie I've ever watched.
B0000CFW87|3.0|This CD is very similar to Josh Groban's first album.  While this style has been successful, perhaps it is time for him to try something new.<br />The songs he has chosen for this album are quite relaxing and calming.  It is easy to listen to the whole CD without growing tired of the sound (as often happens with other genres of music).  However, as in the first album, Josh's voice is often drowned out by overemotional and exaggerated orchestration.<br />On a somewhat unrelated note, many other reviewers have mentioned that they enjoyed &quot;You Raise Me Up&quot;.  I suggest listening to the song as performed by Secret Garden on their album titled &quot;Once in a Red Moon&quot;; that rendition is even better.
B00000373U|5.0|I've had this CD and all Elliott's since before he committed suicide and this one is his top effort. Either/Or blends the bare accoustic style on his first two albums (Roman Candle, Elliott Smith) but add's the harmonies of his two following albums without over doing it and still making him feel very indie. And as always his song writing is beautiful and genius, such as on &quot;Between the Bars&quot; where he mixes thoughts of love, jail and alchohol. Then later on in the CD he totally rocks out on &quot;Cupid's Trick&quot; and goes crazy guitar solo style. And then caps it all off with the amazingly beautiful and light hearted &quot;Say Yes&quot; which everyone is guarenteed to love. Since he has died now, Its a must to atleast pick up an album or two by him and this is what you need to get.
B00005BF9Z|1.0|This is by far Manu Chao's worst CD. His lyrics have no meaning and he recycles tunes from his previous CD. If you want a Manu Chao CD worth it's weight gold buy Clandestino. If you want a Manu Chao CD not worth it's weight in paper buy this terrible CD.
0385510438|4.0|I believe John Grisham is truly one of America,s greatest writers , not only one of the most popular. He spoiled me with &quot; King of Torts&quot; , which I believe to be his best and one of the best books I,ve ever read. Bleachers followed and was excellent illustrating how we idolize coaches and team that are successful and overlooking that this same were not always hero,s to their children and friends. The Last Juror is an very good read bringing Grisham back to his boyhood Mississippi. There are a lot of little stories along with the main theme. This is almost the differance between just eating and dining. It,s Good.
B00006JDVV|1.0|Spoilers thar be.<br />Oh, what a glorious amazing film this could have been. A fascinating idea with a lot of original potential. As usual, it was all flushed away in favor of easy trash. But what is really worse is that the posters (and trailers to some degree) still advertised this film for what it could have been. Not what it is. It's basically false advertising.<br />The posters feature London in flames, Big Ben blazing, an apache helicopter in aerial combat with a dragon. Wow! Did this EVER happen at any point in the film? NO! What we do get however is 90 minutes of dirty peasants standing about in a quarry and 10 minutes of very unremarkable dragons huffing and puffing. The idea of them ruling the world is completely lost as we never see anything other than a dirty quarry.<br />The trailer said that the movies takes place in 2084 but it doesn't it begins in 2010 (for no particular reason) when a young Christian Bale (a great actor who is repeatedly contracting himself to bad movies) hangs about at his mother's work (drilling for a new underground tunnel for London's tube trains). He comes across some kind of weird egg in a long, long forgotten cave. This, somehow, reawakens a sleeping dragon (which must be female if it has laid this egg) which promptly kills some of the diggers and escapes. Right at this moment the movie jumps to several years later!<br />What a rip off! The entire story of the Dragons taking over the world is just skipped. Why? They threw all of that away! Then they expect us to accept a story in which tough American soldier Van Zant (Matthew McConaughey) travels all the way across the Atlantic with his team to wipe out the Granddaddy of all dragons, who is located in London. But Van Zant travels there via a Northumberland quarry. Makes sense. He says that he would have brought a bigger team but lost most of them over the ocean. Why would dragons be out on the ocean? Fishing? Swimming? I hope they didn't expect us to imagine that they were on some kind of reconnaissance mission.<br />So, anyway, Van Zant believes that this big dragon is the only male and killing it will lead to the extinction of the speices. This means that female dragons can only lay female eggs. So where did this male come from if the Dragon at the start was female? Even a throwaway line of pure exposition would have covered over this gaping error.<br />And how does all the 3D imaging technology and tanks and helicopters Van Zant brings with him work? It would have broke in that space of time. And how did they transport a tank over the Atlantic exactly? And how could his team have lasted so long when they are clearly idiots and get killed right away?<br />All good questions. No good answers.<br />The fact that it's only 98 minutes long makes me suspect major changes in post-production.<br />The DVD is in 2.35:1 anamorphic widescreen with Dolby 5.1 sound (the R2 release by Disney has a DTS track).on some kind of reconnaissance mission. <br />So, anyway, Van Zant believes that this big dragon is the only male and killing it will lead to the extinction of the speices.

B00005JLPK|5.0|This movie was spectacular. Julie Taymor did a great job, especially incorporating the way that Kahlos experiences shaped her art. This movie had everything..happiness, sadness, distress, hatred, love. Selma seriously went through the whole gamut for this. I was VERY dissapointed that she did not win the Oscar for best actress. Not only would it have been great to see an Hispanic actress win, but it would have placed even greater legitimacy to her project! I love Nicole's work, but her performance in THE HOURS was not to par with Selmas. I mean, jeez, Nicole was only in the movie for..what 30 minutes..while Selma held the entire film. You will love this movie..haha dont forget to get the tequila shots out, it only makes it better..but it also makes you cry harder!! Viva TEQUILA!!
B0000C8AVR|5.0|This is perhaps the greatest Dylan album of them all.  I can understand arguements for Blood on the Tracks, but this was the groundbreaker and from an historic point of view this is where Dylan left is mark.  If he never released another album people would still be talkin about his influence based on what he accomplished on the lp.
B0001HAISG|5.0|Director J.P. Hogan does an amazing job blending the child-like wonder of a treasured fairy-tale classic with the underlining mature issues that play such a large role in the original book. This is, hands down, the best rendition of the story to date, not to mention the best children's movie I've seen since the days of my own childhood. This movie is guarenteed to bring out the child in you.
B0000X2EOW|5.0|This movie is wonderful. I highly recommend it. All the viewers out there who liked this movie I'd also encourage you to watch the movies: The Dark Crystal, Legend, and The NeverEnding Story. I grew up on these kinds of movies and to me they're much better than the movies currently out there for kids. These movies are family type movies.<br />Note: Jennifer Connely was good in this movie as was David Bowie. Who would have thought he could act? The puppets are wonderful also. Nobody could do puppets like Jim Henson.
B00006CXSS|5.0|This is my favorite television production, of any genre.  It would have been wonderful to have seen this on the big screen too, I think.  I have bought the DVD, and have seen it four or five times, and I am ready to see it again.  Only a few of my DVDs or (mostly I have) tapes have I seen more than a few times, but I think this will have very long desireability of play.  The music, the production values, and the characters are simply unforgettable.<br />The ten hours lets you get involved in a way one can not with a movie. I so recommend this production.
B00004TL21|5.0|Deftones got me into nu-metal for a while, then I realized that this band is about as good as it gets from that genre.  White Pony has definetely got its share of time in my stereo.<BR>I absolutely adore every song on this album(except teenager but thats okay)<BR>My personal favorite is Street Carp with Korea in at a close second.<br />Some other standout track are: Pink Maggit, Passenger, Elite, and Knife Prty.
B00018D44U|5.0|Nora Jones really is the mirror-image of most of today's music.  Under-produced, understated and slow, it is stripped bare of all the production and marketing gimmicks that are meant to convince us of musical substance.  It reduces the performance to direct and intimate communication between the artist and the audience.  <br />I think it works because Nora's knows how to convey emotion and the natural qualities of her voice enhance the effect.<br />So much feeling from so little effort ...We're used to seeing entertainers hop and flop around, feign exertion, expose various parts of their body, and deliberately violate various sexual and social morays in order to elicit an emotional response.  Surely Nora's quiet performance can't match this.<br />In my opinion she more than succeeds.  More genuine emotion is conveyed in \\"Humble Me\\" than all the bare belly-buttons and ridiculous histrionics that others employ.  Nora's music is straightforward. Her band plays in a very simplistic fashion - and sometime things do get a little too sparse - but Nora's voice and her ability to communicate is the talent here, and it is substantial.
B000002L7Y|4.0|One of the songs I had copied for me (at the time, tape-to-tape was the best way to go) by my high school colleague Howard Narvaez was by the Norwegian trio who joined in the 80's synth-pop bandwagon and became best known for their #1 US and #2 UK hit single, &quot;Take On Me&quot;  What made a-ha's single a hit from nowhere was Magne Furuholmen's (best known as Mags for short) keyboards running at a dizzying express train's pace, and Morton Harket's Tony (Spandau Ballet) Hadley-like voice rising to a keening falsetto in the last line of the chorus.  Oh, and their revolutionary animated hand-drawn video on MTV made sure my peers heard of them.<br />So, what of the attendant album, Hunting High And Low?  The third single, &quot;Train Of Thought&quot; treads more on an industrial line, though still entrenched in pop, with Harket's non-falsetto voice sounding close to Jim Kerr's but with pop sensibilities.<br />The title track and fourth single is a haunting ballad, where I finally hear Pal Waaktaar's guitars and piano.  Some eagle keening sound effects and soaring synths sound before the drums kick in to make the bridge and final chorus more intense.<br />&quot;The Blue Sky&quot; is harmless pedestrian New Wave pop while the five minute mid-paced ballad &quot;Living A Boy's Adventure Tale&quot; veers more toward Spandau Ballet territory.  There's a nice touch with airy synths and a clarinet (I believe).<br />The second single, &quot;The Sun Always Shines on TV&quot; reached #1 on the UK charts but stalled in the US Top 20.  A Top 5 hit in my book.  The piano-synths, and Harket's falsetto spouting romantic lyrics, lead to an explosion of guitar and keyboards and an intensity that rivals its predecessor single.  The blossoming synths in the chorus must've done it for me.<br />After the brief throwaway ballad &quot;And You Tell Me,&quot; things get back in high gear for &quot;Love Is Reason,&quot; a song Stacey Q wouldn't have minded doing on her first album.  Pal's brief strumming bursts on the chorus is notable on this could've-been-a-single.<br />Could the staccato synths of &quot;I Dream Myself Alive&quot; been one of the paving stones for the Information Society?  Could've been, in the same way the third-gear &quot;Here I Stand And Face The Rain,&quot; with Harket's grimmer lower register vocals might've influenced other industrial groups.<br />How else to follow a successful single like &quot;Take On Me&quot;?  Answer, they couldn't, and they became less relevant to the US and more to the UK, although they later surfaced with the title track to the Bond movie &quot;The Living Daylights.&quot;  No, I don't know what Norwegian for &quot;one-hit wonder&quot; is, and I'd probably be insulting them for trying to find that out.  P.S. and thanks Howard, wherever you are, for copying that song for me.f strumming bursts on the chorus is notable on this could've-been-a-single.<br />Could the staccato synths of &quot;I Dream Myself Alive&quot; been one of the paving stones for the Information Society?

B00005JLRT|1.0|I really wanted to like this film. I really did. That's why it hurts so much to have to write this. But I must warn others. Do not see this film. I remember the excitement I felt when I discovered this film was going to be released. Alas.<br />There are possible spoilers below, so beware.<br />The film starts pleasantly enough, with Riker's wedding to Troi after showing trouble in the midst of the Romulan government. Wesley Crusher is finally given his due screen appearance. He is as gorgeous as always. I know that they cut out an entire 45 minute segment featuring him, which I was unhappy to hear.<br />Next, the Trek crew finds scans indicating posotronic activity on a planet, so they go to investigate, finding parts to an android almost identical to Data. They land on a desert planet and Picard acts completely unlike his character. The reserved French captain is now a high testosterone mini-dimensional fun lovin' bad cop kind of guy roving through the desert in a Jeep/Hummer-esque vehichle. I can't quite grasp how Data could locate this new android if only the brain is posotronic, which has been hammered into our heads since the series began. But forget all the rules made so far. To quote the Fantasticks, this movie &quot;defies logic and achieves ignorance!&quot; In the desert the crew meets nasty creatures that look like copies of Max Shreck's 1922 Nosferatu. Of course the vehichles are equipped with laser cannons and such and much F/X money was spent making loud booms.<br />After this lame adventure, the new android is put together. It is Data's mentally disabled brother. Blah blah blah. We already did this. It would have been much more interesting to do exploration with the Lor character. Hmm.. imagine doing battle with Lor. At least THAT would be a match for the Trek crew. Anyway, the new android is called B4. How tacky. A very uninteresting subplot altogether.<br />The &quot;story&quot; continues, if you can call it that. We learn the Romulan senate has a new praetor, Shinzon. Jean Luc gets an awesome cameo from Janeway.  Next, the Enterprise-E visits Romulus, and of course war breaks out, blah blah blah.<br />**end of obvious spoilers you already figured out from the preview**<br />The villain, Shinzon is underdeveloped. The story is too. It felt like echoes of Wrath of Khan were bubbling here. This is the first Star Trek I've seen that was simply a lame battle scenario. Half of the movie was spent at war. It felt felt the Matrix Revolutions to me. Pointless one dimensional buildup and buildup, huge battles, but absolutely no pleasure or satifaction in any of it.<br />Star Trek has been great because each episode/movie dealt with a moral dilemma choice, well built characters and intriguing situations. This movie has none of that. It's just a big battle. If you like explosions and loud sound effects, this movie is for you. If not, beware. Characters are altered for no reason whatsoever. There is no real emotional buildup, just constant fighting, so the climax is boring and uninteresting. It feels like this is the end of Trek, which truly saddens me. It feels like Star Trek is trying to reinvent itself. It was fine before, people! That's why there is still a fan base! Even the music felt similar to the hokey music from the first season of TNG - even with those crappy 80s synth sounds. I cannot say enough: avoid this movie.<br />1/5
0385335482|2.0|This book follows the same formula as Bridget Jones Diary.  However, the &quot;Shopaholic&quot; is nowhere near as endearing as Bridget Jones is.  Rebecca, the &quot;Shopaholic&quot; is materialistic, shallow, irresponsible, and a liar.  &quot;Jerk&quot; is probably the best word I can come up with right now to describe her.  I gave it two stars because it's a fast-paced book but I cannot find anything else good to say about it.  I bought the second installment--&quot;Shopaholic Takes Manhattan&quot; book which I will read--but only because I've already wasted my money on it.
B0000CFW87|5.0|When I first heard Josh sing at the Olympics, I knew it was something special, so, I wrote his name down to find a recording later.  The next I heard about him was on the 20/20 special with Barbara Walters.  Now I own his self-titled album (the US version) the Live In Concert PBS DVD special, and the Internet-Only Fans Edition of Closer.  I went to see Josh in concert recently as well.  He is an exceptional talent, as anyone who has heard him perform will tell you.  Even more, though, he is a nice person, as attested to by those who have met him and spent time with him.  &quot;Closer&quot; is a CD that every family and individual should own.  Josh's vocal appeal spans generation and racial gaps.  His recordings are a timeless edition to any musical collection.

0486266885|5.0|I went into this book expecting something of the pulp monster story Hyde always becomes in the movies, and it's absolutely not what I got.  What we have here instead is a wonderful little book that shoves an incredible amount of depth and character development into  a book readable in a little over an hour.  Really, an hour isn't much reading time to experience one of the great literary classics,  so pick up a copy.
B00005JMJ4|1.0|Definetely in the top 5 of the worst movies I've ever viewed!  The movie starts out the same way it ends.  Nothing ever changes.  After 5 minutes you can turn it off because you have basically viewed the whole thing.  Just because a movie is terrible, critics have to love it and call it arty.  Its so bad you are drawn into it because you know something interesting has got to happen.  The only attention grabbing part is at the very end with the &quot;whisper in the ear&quot; and even that is a let down.  I highly recomend seeing this movie just to see how awfull it really is!  Thank you

He cannot rhyme worth of lick other than the song where he used 64 &quot;F&quot; words and rhymed with simple stuff like mom dad, cop, badge. I was eager to listen to this album after I heard the song Rollin, Rollin remix, and My way. Broiler was on TV and that song is just 5 or 6 lines being repeated. Its like Limp Bizkit try 2 make the best of this album putting songs like Broiler on TV. <br />Lyrics: F*<BR>Production: B<BR>Delivery: F*<BR>Overall: F*<br />* F means Failing in case some fans may misunderstand me as one the hardcore moshpit fans who uses the F words.

B00005BL2A|4.0|After flirting with guitar-driven sounds to varying degrees for more than a decade, Depeche Mode finally returned to their roots with an almost wholly electronic album: Exciter.  The title is slightly misleading because Exciter is a relaxed, fun album not nearly so ponderous with angst and gloom as its forebears (though this trend started with 1997's Ultra).  Venerable fans of Violator and Music for the Masses might dismiss Exciter simply because it is different, but I get the feeling that these people would be pleased with only a rehashing of Depeche Mode's greatest hits, in which case they should just buy 86>98 and pretend that time, and music, do not move forward.<br />With that out of the way, Exciter is not DM's best offering.  It sometimes jars the listener out of a wonderful trance (the bridge in \\"Shine,\\" for example) or just underwhelms the ears with overly simplistic melodies and lyrics (\\"I Feel Loved\\").  But for each of these minor shortcomings, Exciter compensates with several successes.<br />DM themselves have said that Exciter was meant to pay homage to past Depeche Mode songs.  The opener \\"Dream On\\" makes a concession to the acoustic guitar of \\"Personal Jesus\\" and also sets an ambitious benchmark lyrically for the rest of the album.  \\"Shine\\" recalls \\"Stripped\\" by urging a girl to \\"forget the pictures on your TV screen.\\" \\"The Sweetest Condition\\" digs up the sensory addiction of Violator's \\"The Sweetest Perfection,\\" though here it's ex sex rather than heroin.  \\"When the Body Speaks\\" dreams of \\"One Caress,\\" and offers probably the tenderest moment on the entire album.  And finally, \\"Breathe\\" is the obverse of \\"A Question of Lust\\" or \\"Things You Said,\\" exploring jealousy in a troubled relationship.  All of these songs have a decidedly modern sound to them, but to the longtime DM aficionado there are hidden clues that help trace their roots back to previous albums.<br />Yet Exciter is not just an exercise in repetitive nostalgia -- there are several songs here that stand out as total surprises.  \\"Easy Tiger\\" is a lazy, hazy moodsetter perfect for a night on the town.  \\"The Dead of Night\\" swaggers drunkenly onstage with crotch-grabbing guitars and sleazy beats.  It's not very DM, but it grows on you once you get in on the joke.  Then there's the seduction that is \\"Freelove,\\" weary of attachments and promises.  It's about as sensitive as it can be, given its message.  \\"Comatose\\" is one of Martin's vocal turns, sexually possessed to the point of selflessness.  \\"I Am You\\" also depicts a dependent relationship, matched with a languid beat suggesting the impossibility of escape.  And Exciter's closer, \\"Goodnight Lovers,\\" is a touching lullaby perfect for showcasing Dave's fully recovered voice.<br />This album shows that Depeche Mode still are making some great music, even if it does not quite reach the heady plateau of Black Celebration through Violator.  Dave and Martin provide some of the best vocal performances of their career, and the lyrics (with the exception of \\"I Feel Loved\\") are complex and sophisticated.  Four stars for an album that is both upbeat and intelligent.here that stand out as total surprises.  \\"Easy Tiger\\" is a lazy, hazy moodsetter perfect for a night on the town.  \\"The Dead of Night\\" swaggers drunkenly onstage with crotch-grabbing guitars and sleazy beats.

0385474547|4.0|Okonkwo changes and adapts throughout Things Fall Apart; he becomes a symbol for the entire tribe, as many traits of the Ibo tribe are reflected in the character of Okonkwo. Like Okonkwo, the Ibo tribe is not concerned about prophecies, only actions and strength. Okonkwo many time loses sight of the line drawn by the tribe, and is perpetually breaking its law. Perhaps the greatest difference between Okonkwo and his village is their abilities to forgive.  Okonkwo is exigent and allows little flexibilities when it comes to his rules, whereas the Ibo tribe itself has forgiven Okonkwo time and time again.
B000002UAO|5.0|More so than Revolver, ofter considered its sister album, or their swan song Abbey Road, Rubber Soul stands as the Beatles' crowning achievement in terms of superior song writing and performance.  The mastery of their medium is indicative here with the Dylan influenced &quot;Norwedian Wood&quot; and &quot;Nowhere Man&quot;, but The Beatles went beyond musical quotation and influence to create something that is by far amazing and enduring.  Although most Americans will immediately notice differences from their US vinyl equivalent, that should not deter one from purchasing this CD.  This recording presents a maturing sound, illustrating The Beatles exploring sounds, arrangements, and musical instruments, but not yet bound to the deus ex machina of the studio as they would become in Sgt. Pepper; however, nor does it possess the oppressive weight and personal dissonance of later, &quot;naked&quot; works like Let It Be or portions of The White Album.  It is fascinating to think that the more popish Help! immediately preceded this record and that in less than 5 years of its release, The Beatles would cease to perform as a band together.  For those of you who do not have it, its absence in your collection is no less than shocking, but the good news is that there is still hope for you.
B0000AQS0F|5.0|Firefly is amazing entertainment.  It takes the sci-fi genre and gives it a good, swift kick in the rump.  It's a show that relies on character development instead of technobabble and plot rather than special effects (although the special effects are pretty good for a TV show).  It's a little unconventional with the western/sci-fi mix, but it also adds unmeasurable charm and believability.  The characters seem pretty generic at first, but by the end of the 2-hour premier, their personalities come out.  By the end of the third episode, Mal and the gang feel like old friends.  There are no aliens, no transporters, no laser pistols.  But there is witty and clever dialog, suspense, laughs, and great writing.<br /><br />Like most people, I never heard of Firefly until it was off the air.  There is no way this show would have \\"failed\\" if it had been properly promoted by FOX.  Look at all the 5-star reviews!  I'd give it 10 stars if I could; it's just that good.

0375422307|5.0|This autobiography of a girl growing up in revolutionary Iran is at times heart-wrenching, and at times heart-warming. Satrapi presents her memories growing up during the revolutionary Iran in comic-book form, uniquely illustrating the powerful emotions that she felt. Satrapi was only 9 years old when the revolution began, and she tells the powerful story of her family's life as revolutionaries before the Shah, welcoming his ouster. They soon become concerned, realizing that the revolution was not one of freedom, but a revolution of a different kind of totalitarianism. The story continues with the patriotic feelings of her family during the Iraq-Iran War, as her society struggles to survive. That patriotism soon gives way to anger and fear, as her own life is threatened by the fundamentalist regime, when the rebellious values her parents instilled in her lead her to disobey the decrees issued by the government.<br />Her book stays away from sensationalism, focusing on its presentation through the eyes of a 9-year-old girl. The innocence that Satrapi communicates through her memories allows one to take a fresh look at the current situation in Iran.

B000002GYR|5.0|It's not the beat Tom, and it's not the later, husky, noisy Tom.  It's poetic and, yes, sentimental.  But not without humor and not without all things that make Tom Waits who he is.<br />Of what I would categorize as his &quot;sentimental&quot; albums, I think this is the best.  &quot;Martha&quot; is just so wonderful; I play it over and over in my car.  In fact, when I try to take this CD out of my car, it's back within a week.  (I see there's no &quot;Martha&quot; clip here; give &quot;I hope I don't fall in love with you&quot; a listen for a great representation.)  <br />I do love &quot;Small Change&quot; and &quot;Rain Dogs&quot;  and those of that ilk, but if you're looking for *this* Waits-genre I'd easily recommend &quot;Closing Time&quot; over the soundtrack w/Crystal Gayle, et.al.  One of my favorite albums ever.
B0000DD7LC|5.0|This CD is amazing. Alicia captures so much from the listener with the passion and emotion that she put into this CD. All of the tracks are amazing and it's definitely a CD that you can listen to the whole way through. Everybody should have The Diary Of Alicia Keys in their CD collection because even if your not feeling it right now, it will definitely grow on you and that's a promise. This young lady has a lot of talent and if you don't have Songs In A Minor or The Diary Of Alicia Keys, then you are definitely missing out on something and someone that is going to be here for years to come. There's something for everyone on the album whether you are into hip-hop, rnb, soul music, funk, a little classical, or jazz. She combines all of those sounds and elements and creates something that is totally unique and totally hers. Listen to the music, study it, critique it, analyze it, but most of all enjoy it. Her music can be studied, from the instruments, the emotion, and the differnt styles mixed together. Can't say that about a lot of other artists. Don't miss out on a good thing because I promise that you won't be disappointed. Support true rnb and soul music. An artist like this is very rare to find.
B0000541AM|5.0|This is a fun and entertaining movie.  I enjoyed it tremendously when I first saw it (I was in middle or high school).  Enjoyed it just as much many years later when I rented the VHS tape (first job out of college) and now I'm in my 40's and get to own the DVD and enjoy this gem again.<br />Oh, how I enjoyed the &quot;can you dig it&quot; that someone chose to use in their review before mine.  Watch the movie and you'll understand why.<br />I give the movie 5 stars because in my humble opinion it is very entertaining and fun.  One of my all time favorites.<br />Can you dig it???
0515123447|5.0|Lee Child in his initial novel Killing Floor beautifully crafts a masterful thriller in the action adventure genre.  Child's plot simmers just like his hero Jack Reacher slowly but unavoidably reaching the boiling point.<br />Reacher, a 35 year old honorably discharged veteran military policeman is currently living a hobo's existence cruising around the country by bus.  A blues afficiando, while passing through Georgia he remembers having heard that legendary blues guitarist Blind Blake had passed away in the small town of Margrave.  With nothing presssing in his schedule, he gets off the bus and hikes 14 miles to check out the town.<br />While having breakfast in the local diner he is arrested as a suspect in a local murder that has just been uncovered.  Another suspect Paul Hubble, a local investment banker, is also brought in for questioning.  Both Reacher and Hubble are sent to the local prison while their alibis are checked.  While incarcerated they are almost murdered by the inmates in a very suspicious fashion.<br />Reacher is released and soon learns that the murder victim is none other than his older brother Joe, a U.S. Treasury agent.  Nosing around town he manages to stumble into a brilliant criminal scheme headed by a wealthy and devious Mr. Kliner. Kliner owns 4 large warehouses and fronts a foundation that dumps truckloads of money into the upkeep of Margrave and its citizens.<br />Reacher soon learns of the widespread corruption in the town including Mayor Teale and Chief of Police Morrisson.  He befriends Chief detective Finlay who along with Officer Roscoe, a soon to be Reacher love interest, aid him in avenging his brother's murder and cleaning up the town.<br />Child creates an empathetic and cunning hero in Reacher who using his vast experience and resources embarks on a very satisfying campaign of vengeance.  I will absolutely be sure to continue reading the books in this series
B00000JZIK|5.0|The Usual Suspects<br />Every now and again a film comes along that is described as a gem. This is because the film just like a gem is a surprising pleasure to find esecially amongst the mass expanse and typical rubble of moviedom. <br />The Usual Suspects...<BR>is just such a gem!<br />The film is described as a classic by all who have seen it even though it was released as recently as 1995. The title of the film itself is said to be borrowed from the much earlier classic, Casablanca.<br />When the film was released, it contained a host of 'unknowns'. However, do not associate the word 'unknowns' with 'untalented'; as is proved by the star of the film, Kevin Spacey, who picked up an Oscar for his mesmerising performance as Verbal Kint. <br />I confess that I will not try and give you a detailed synopsis of the film as I do not want to spoil your viewing (or perhaps more appropriately I would not know where to start my synopsis!)<br />Quick Synopsis:<BR>Five Criminals Are Brought Together In A Police Line-Up...<br />If you are going to see the film for the first time, you will notice that when you ask for the film at your local video store, a smile will mould itself onto the owner's face. Why?<BR>Because he knows just as everyone else who has seen the film that you are letting yourself in for something special.<br />And, I guarantee you that the next time you go into your local video store and catch a glimpse of the now 'oh-so-famous' cover of the film out of the corner of your eye you will notice that whereas before the film camouflaged itself against all the other films, it now seems to shine just like a self-assured individual stands out from a crowd.<br />If you are going to see the film for the second/third/whatever time. I hope you enjoy the film again and have fun trying to answer the immortal question:<BR>WHO IS KEYSER SOZE?<br />Hope you found this review helpful.
B000002O5L|5.0|Full Moon Fever was Tom Pettys first solo album away from the Heartbreakers, and boy was it a hit, and for good reason, its one of the greatest albums ever recorded! This was Tom Pettys biggest selling album with or without the Heartbreakers. Mostly just acoustic material but thats ok because this album is top notch!<br />Full Moon Fever starts off with one of Tom Pettys greatest songs, the classic 'Free Fallin' this is truly one of the best songs ever. Then we roll right into another hit off the all 'I Wount Back Down' this is classic, awesome guitar, great lyrics its an all around good song! The other hit off the albun was the killer 'Runnin Down A Dream' this has one of the greatest guitar riffs of all time! Its a really good driving song, like all of Tom Pettys other material. Tom finaly pays tribute to his biggest influence, The Byrds on Full Moon Fever, with 'Feel A Whole Lot Better' which is just awesome. 'Zombie Zoo' is just great fun, and its a really cool track if you give it a chance. But the best song on the album has to be 'Yer So Bad' it is probley my all time favorite Tom Petty song.<br />This is one of the greatest albums of all tiem just buy it and you will understand what I mean!
B0000DIXN7|5.0|Amy Winehouse - Frank<br />I first came across Amy Winehouse when I was browsing through the 'coming soon' section of Windows Media Player. There was a short audio clip from a &quot;new up-and-coming artist&quot;, so I decided to play the clip on repeat while checking my e-mails. However, I was surprised to learn that even after a full twenty minutes I had still been listening to the same two minute clip... that means ten times in a row! This immediately told me two things: one, I need to get my ears checked! And two, Ms Winehouse took/takes/will take easy-listening to a whole other level.<br />I can not disagree with any of the comments from the sticker on the front cover: 'A colossal vocal talent', 'One of the most impressive British debuts in years', 'Stunning debut'. If you like 'easy on the ear' albums, I would definitely recommend this. Of course, if you are a sucker for female voices I'd also recommend Dido (what's that... you've already got it... no surprises there), Katie Melua (Closest thing to Crazy...), Norah Jones (Go away With Her) and someone whom I think is under-rated Emiliana Torrini (Love In the Time of Science).<br />I do not go out of my way to sit down and actively listen to an album. Instead, I prefer to play it in the background. So, when I buy an album I will play it from start to finish, reading a book while it is playing. If the album flows one should not be able to tell how many tracks are on the album - it should seem like one long music fest. But, for me, if it is not a good album it won't flow. (It is surprising how well this method works. Try it... it really does work!)<br />I enjoy listening to albums like this i.e. albums that are albums rather than a collection of singles. Albums like this seem to have been lost over the years (listen to me... I'm sounding like an old fogey!). Albums like this flow like a story, like a story there is always a distinct underlying theme. But that does not mean that there is the same old fare for every track, afterall all good stories have a change of pace, and this is true of 'Frank'.<br />When I first heard the album, there were definitely some tracks that stood out straight away. I immediately recognised 'Stronger Than Me' - it was the song that I had heard on Windows Media Player. (I just wish I could play the chorus on repeat again and again...). 'F**k Me Pumps' is probably responsible for the 'Parental Guidance Advisory' sticker on the front of the album. But, don't let this put you off this sassy dig at gold-digging women. It definitely requires a second listen to appreciate the lyrics: 'without girls like you there'd be no fun, we'd go to the club and not see anyone, without girls like you there'd be no nightlife all those men just go home to their wives' (ouch!). 'In My Bed' and 'Take The Box' are sure to become classics in their own right. (Info just for fans: 'Take The Box' actually has the title 'Frank' in the lyrics; again, Ms Winehouse may be teasing us as to the real meaning behind the title of her album i.e 'Good Will Hunting'-style).<br />However, on listening to the album a couple of times there was one track that really stood out. But, whenever I tried to find it I had no luck! When I finally came across the track on listening to the album again I noted down its location. I discovered that it is a hidden track!! It does not have its own track number, it is not listed on the back of the album but it has its own separate lyrics section in the accompanying album sleeve. It is actually located in track 2 (5 minutes and 15 seconds into track 2... to be exact!). The track is called 'Cherry'. It is probably hidden because it is a short track but I like to think of it as a hidden gem - perhaps one of my favourite tracks on the album. 'Her name is Cherry. We just met. But, already she knows me better than you'. Even the most cynical amongst you will have a smile on your face after this song. The vocals on this track I think epitomise the whole album, Ms Winehouse is best when she just lets her voice go and is as the album states 'frank' with her lyrics.<br />I am always so worried for artists such as Ms Winehouse because they have such an impact on their debut, they are so new and so fresh, one has to ask where can they go from here on in? However, perhaps I am being a bit presumptuous... afterall Dido's doing alright. ;o) <br />As debuts go this is phenomenal.<BR>As albums go this is awesome. <BR>I for one am looking forward to what Ms Winehouse comes up with next.<br />Hope you enjoyed the review and found it helpful.<BR>Whatever album you decide to buy I hope it's the right one for you.
B00004U8JV|2.0|This movie was very medeocre. I don't really like Jeff Goldblum very much. I think they should just end the movies. It is alright to see only once, but it for sure isn't worth buying.

B000002H6C|5.0|i own all of the metallica albums, and AJFA is my favorite one. all of the songs are good i can listen to the whole thing withour touching the skip button. It also has a variety of songs; you have &quot;blackened,&quot; and &quot;dyers eve,&quot; which are extremely fast songs then you have &quot;one&quot; which starts off slow and gets fast, and all the others are good too. the insturmental &quot;to live is to die&quot; is amazing, from the guitar work to the drumming i think it is metallicas best instrumental. It is not a cd you get tired of after listening it a few times either. go out and buy this cd, you wont be sorry.
B00005JN08|4.0|i just   got   back  from   seeing   eurotrip and   i   thought   it   was   really  funny . the  main   reason  i   saw   eurotrip  was   because  michelle   trachtenberg   is  in   it .  the   movie   trailer  might  lead   you  to  think  michelle  gets  naked  in   it  but  unfortunatly  she   doesn't   and   doesn't   show   anything   that  you  can't  already  see   in   the   movie   trailer. but  aside  from  that it  is was   pretty  good   so  i   gave  it  4  stars.

B00008973Q|5.0|So much has been written about this film and its' importance I am going to pass over reviewing the movie and say that we all know it is one of the best films ever. <BR>Most previous releases of this film are just terrible.  They have ghosting, color smearing, loss of detail, etc. until they are just about unwatchable.  This edition looks great!  I have that sickeningly expensive limited edition set from last year and I would have to say that this is at least as good a print and perhaps better.  This is a great buy!
0140177396|5.0|I am from BLA high school in the bronx and I thank my teacher MS. Solomon for giving us this book to read. This book tells the story of true friends and how hard it was during the great depression. From this book I have learned that sometimes you just got to do what is best for you and your friend. This book always has a new surprise. The author uses symbolism and foreshadowing to tell the story. As the story goes on the better it gets. I have read this book twice and I can just keep reading it over and over because it tells such good details and information. Reading this book you will feel as if you were there because the action never ends you will keep being surprised until the last sentence of the book.
B00005JMJ4|2.0|This is a touching, understated film deserving four stars, but on DVD it opens with a long set of mandatory commercials -- the Menu function is disabled so you must watch the commercials before you can watch the movie. It's hard to recommend purchasing a product that forces you to watch advertising, and I can't give it more than two stars.<br />I believe Amazon should inform people when a DVD contains mandatory advertising.
B0000CD5FN|5.0|Mostly, I decided to write this review after seeing another that I read in a magazine. <BR>I'm bitter at times, and they gave it a below average review so it's time to balance the scales.<BR>Honestly I would say that 'Rock Art..' was Joe's best,  <BR>'Earthquake Wheather' and 'Globbal a-Go-Go' and I suppose even 'Cut the Crap' are all great listens and all showed Joe's love for music and also showed off his wonderful writting skills. Though, 'Streetcore' is a great album. I guess it wasn't 100% done before Joe's death but what's here is great. <BR>The only thing about this *which also is sad* is the hole it has in it. 'Hole' meaning how it doens't feel complete. <BR>That's noones fault but it can bring the Clash/Strummer fan to tears, especially the last few seconds of 'Silver and Gold'. <BR>Anyway, every track on this album is good, to say the very least. The Bob Marley cover is fantastic, though, his duet with Johnny Cash is almost too much to handle *good not bad*. <BR>In the end 'Streetcore' is a wonderful album and is also a great example of great music...<BR>Joe Strummer has gotten his share of guff over the years but he has proven that he was a legand and an asset to rock. <BR>There really isn't too much I can say to convince anyone to buy this. Mostly I wanted to express my love for Joe and I hope that anyone who happens to come across this *or anyone of his recordings* will pick it up.
B000063DI9|5.0|Iron Maiden has proved again that they are one of the best power metal bands. This cd is so cool. The sound is good the cd was well produced. &quot;Seventh Son of a Seventh Son&quot; is one of the best Maiden cds I own. The cd opens with one heck of a song called &quot;Moonchild&quot;. Then comes &quot;Infinite Dreams&quot; an awesome song. Then comes one of my favorite Maiden songs &quot;Can I Play with Madness&quot; (Watch the video). Then comes possably the most awesome Maiden song ever &quot;The Evil the Men Do&quot;. Then if you don't listen to the cd a least listen to the song &quot;Seventh Son of a Seventh Son&quot; your in for a treat. Another good song on this cd is &quot;Only the Good Die Young&quot; (No relation to the Billy Joel song). On the whole this is an exellant cd. if you want other good Maiden cds listen to &quot;Dance of Death&quot; or &quot;Brave New World&quot; &quot;Powerslave&quot; is good to.
B0000B0WVQ|5.0|I just want to say that &quot;The Valleys&quot; is the most stunning song I've heard in ages.  It will stop you dead in your tracks.  The entire cd is a winner, in fact.
B000099T2L|3.0|Beyonce, Beyonce, Beyonce....you poor girl.  With all the media attention focused on the Destiny's Child member Beyonce Knowles it would appear that this solo album is gold, but with such expectations it would be near impossible to be as good as many people make it out to be.  I bought this album expected nice hip-hop jams like it's first two singles \\"Crazy In Love (feat. Jay Z)\\" and \\"Baby Boy (feat. Sean Paul)\\" which I was turned onto.  But after listening to the whole cd, just a few were actually what I expected the cd to be.  Not that it is necessarily  a bad thing that this isn't a pure hip-hop driven album. In all honesty didn't expect it to fully be a dance record after I heard her third single \\"Me Myself and I\\" and her Grammy performance \\"Dangerously In Love 2\\", but I have to admit, I was still a tad disappointed.<br />Beyonce vocally has a wonderful voice full of power, but in songs such as \\"Naughty Girl\\" and \\"Signs ( feat. Missy Elliot)\\" , she didn't show it.  And lyricly, she doesn't pick the best songs for her vocal style, for instance \\"Hip Hop Star (feat. Big Boi & Sleepy Brown)\\" which came off a tad raspy which wasn't a good choice, well in my opinion anyway.<br /><br />But she did however get the chance to shine with songs such as \\"Dangerously In Love 2\\", \\"Me Myself and I\\", and \\"Yes\\" which her rich voice drips sexuality and power at the time.  She also has good dance beat potential with her already singles \\"Crazy In Love (feat. Jay Z)  \\" and \\"Baby Boy (feat. Sean Paul)\\".  Though she still has room to grow, I believe this album is a mere stepping stone for her future success.
B00008IHN1|5.0|...That is what I wonder everytime I see it.  IT IS SO GOOD and so far better than any movie that I have seen in YEARS that I have to wonder how it ever got made!  You don't need to be black, have any experience with bands, like hip hop, etc to LOVE this movie.  Tired of watching evil people, terrible stories, violence and porn-like-sex scenes?  Then you'll like this movie.  It is just a great story about good people.  SO RARE.  So well done.  I've lost track of how many times I've watched it.
B00009V8Z9|5.0|I am not a sappy, piano love songs kind of girl. I love my rock! However, I love this CD! Don't get me wrong, it isn't sappy. He has great songs with wonderful lyrics, and beautiful songs;Gavin Degraw is a talented guy! I like his Follow Through and I Don't Wanna Be(from One Tree Hill on the WB), but I can't really pick one!! Buy this CD, you won't be disappointed!
006441034X|3.0|The reason why I wanted to read this book is because Hayao Miyazaki is going to turn Howl's Moving Castle into an anime movie.  And Hayao Miyazaki is a genius when it comes to animation.  He surpasses Walt Disney in imagination in his animation.<br />Howl's Moving Castle is great by all means, the story is wonderful, the characters are very well developed, and there are some twists and turns that are just hilarious when it does happen.  This is a book where you can root for the characters.  <br />The one flaw I found reading this book is the author's inability to flow one paragraph to another.  There is a 60% execution rate where the author can link one paragraph to another.  But sometimes the author has problems.  For example, when I was reading the book, (I'll try to avoid giving out spoilers) there was some parts where nothing much happens or the story is very slow, then all of a sudden it takes a turn where you say, \\"What just happened, that paragraph doesn't correlate at all to the previous paragraph of the story, It doesnt even match.\\" So most of the time, you wonder to yourself, what is going on, I'm lost, I'm confused.  <br />Another flaw I found is that the author tried to rush the story.  The story felt rushed, especially during the end.  I kept reading the book, and all of a sudden I finished reading the book, and I wondered to myself, what happened to the climax.  I somewhat read it, is that it?  Is that the climax?<br />Some people will argue, the best way to understand some of the stuff I missed is to read it over again.  Let me tell those people that a good book can explain it all clearly in one read-through.  The only people that would read it twice or 3 times or more are the people that really loved the book.<br />In the end, Hayao Miyazaki will convert this book into something else.  He turns books that have a lot of flaws into animated movies that are 100 times better than the book.
B00008CLOA|5.0|So I heard about this disc and figured I should find out what the rock world will never recover from. Listening the first time you look for loud memorable anthems and you're a little confused (who could blame you) - 'are these all just weird soft songs with noises?' <BR>...then one day you put it on just after work, only trying to relax with it on-- and it BLOWS YOU AWAY! The subject matter is perfect for anyday of your life, it's perfect right after work and fun during it. The subtleties become apparent and it's like a great guitar orchestra. Purchase this album and don't look back.
B00012QLQ4|1.0|i just finished watching it today, the whole day. i could not sit for 2 hours straight watchin this movie that most of the people say is sooo good. i HATE it. since everyone loves it so much i was expecting quality story like ghost in the shell or ninja scroll, but i got a stupid &quot;i donno what to call it&quot; that just draaaggsssssss on and on. and besides that, i hated the animation of the characters, it was &quot;dragonballzee&quot; which i think is cheap. the only thing i did like was the bike racing scenes with the nice light glow trails. on the last note...HORRIBLE MOVIE.
B0000AQS0F|5.0|First off let me say that I have never bought a DVD of a TV series and this is my first TV series on DVD I have bought and my first review. The premise of this show as has been stated by other reviews is that it is a Space/Western, which to be honest overly simplifies this great TV series. The great thing about this show is that it has something for everyone. It had action, comedy, drama..in short it had it all. When I tell people about this show I tell them it's a mix between Sci-Fi and Western. To which I get a perplexed look, but once someone sets down and watches this show they are hooked, they &quot;get it' so to speak. The best example I an give is my wife. She doesn't like Sci-Fi or Westerns, but this was one of here favorite shows. She sat down every Friday night and watched fatithfully just like I did. She doesn't really know why she likes this show since it mixes two genres of T.V. that she doesn't care for. She just says it's something special that really can't be defined. I guess that it the highest complement both her and I can give to Firefly. It was and is something special. If you truly want to be entertained this is the series for you. I'm sure the movie will do well and more people will see what a great show this was.
0312966199|4.0|James Herriot Describing Himself in All Things Bright and Beautiful<br />In the novel All Things Bright and Beautiful, the author James Herriot is using his experiences as a veterinarian in Scotland to make an indirect characterization of himself.  Reading the book, we get the picture of James Herriot as being a person who simply loves life because of the small things that happen in it whether they happen when he visits the farms in the country, goes and gets drunk in a pub, or has to get up in the middle of the night because of his job.  Due to his amusing and joyful way of describing what he sees and does, we get encouraged to love life as much as James Herriot loves it himself.  The way he indirectly describes himself makes the novel a joy to read.<br />We are not supposed to learn the lessons of life when reading this novel; we are supposed to enjoy James Herriot as a fantastic storyteller and get inspired to enjoy the small though extraordinary things in life that happen every day.  The indirect characterization of James Herriot is what makes us realize that.  We get inspired by his personality and his actions.  James Herriot has put his personality onto every page of the book, and it is his personality that shapes the novel and makes it as good and amusing as it is.  James Herriot has not written this novel because he had to; he has written it because he wanted to, and his love of writing about a topic as banal as his own life makes this novel a positively different and extraordinary piece of literature.
B0000028RR|5.0|This album is considered by many to be the best Rage against the Machine album ever produced.  While it may lack the level of knowledge that was put into the songs that came in the Evil Empire album it is still one of the most rebellious ones ever made.  The lyrics openly call for a sudden rebellion, and if anything seems similar to Che Guevara saying the necessary conditions for revolution can be created by the revolution itself.    The album opens with a sort of modern dissident's theme song, Bombtrack, which summarizes exactly what it is like to be a minority leftist.  Then comes Killing in the Name, which is a song about the importance of free thought and not taking orders from others.  It goes into the song Take the Power Back, a critique of the American educational system.  Settle for Nothing is a song about what it is like to come form a dysfunctional family, and how that is connected with the rest of society.  Bullet in the Head was actually the first song that Rage against the Machine played in public; they played it at a party of a friend of one of the band members and the crowd loved it, who wouldn't?  Know your Enemy is my favourite song on the album, it summarizes the emotions and facts that make us dissidents hate America, and calls for us to rise up against it with the lyrics, \\"Now action must be taken, we don't need the key we'll break in!\\"  Wake Up had about the same theme as Know your Enemy, but focuses more on how the government has, \\"neutralized,\\" dissidents.  Fistful of Steel seems to focus on the organizational part of a rebellion, while following song, Township Rebellion, focuses on the active aspect of it.  Freedom acts as a conclusion to the rest of the album, it reminds listeners that their, \\"anger is a gift,\\" and warns them of the many distractions that America tempts potential activists with to keep them from focusing on the real issues.    Many think that because Rage against the Machine signed with a big name label they betrayed their cause in some way.  First of all, Epic is a division of Sony which is a Japanese company, so much of the money spent on their CD's will actually be leaving the 'states and helping a country that is trying to come out of a recession.  And second, Sony was a company which gave them complete artistic freedom and a good budget to make this album (see the Star Profile for RATM) while the other big labels that propositioned them were trying to tone down their musical style so that they would fit into some other more common musical genre.  I have listened to the music from some of the more independent bands and while it sounded nice, the intelligence and music quality did not nearly match that of Rage against the Machine, more people should judge them based on that.
B0000CFW87|5.0|I bought this CD for my wife for Christmas without hearing him <BR>first.  I was surprised at how much good music is on this album.<BR>And Josh performance is marvelous.  I'd rate this album up with <BR>the likes of Bonny Rait's Nick of Time and Santana's Supernatural.<BR>Buy it and enjoy.  Better yet buy several and give them to your <BR>friends.
B0000CDLA7|5.0|...of all the insults that are being thrown at this album and their fans.  I recently have had to put up with some hip/hop/rap \\"music\\"...which I have been told is the most popular music out there today...and all that that is, is just grunting out some sexually explicit vulgarities over some artificial computerized \\"drum\\" beats that any toddler can make on his Fischer Price Music Machine.  And compared to that...this is pure heaven...and they know how to spell.  You may not appreciate this album if you have to dance to your music, or if your musical tastes have not evolved past nursery rhymes.  If, however, your tastes have matured...BUY THIS ALBUM.  And if you do not like it immediately, hopefully some day you will.
B00005JMCT|1.0|i didnt think it was even that funny. i had something to say about every &quot;funny-part&quot;. some parts were all right but i believe the movie should have never been created. And that goes for the sequel. I wish i didn't waste my time watching it.
B0000399WI|5.0|This is my favorite film, and over the years I have watched it grow from a near box office flop to one of the most beloved films.  This is the tale of Andy Dufrense convicted of murdering his wife &quot;and the fella she was banging.&quot; Andy is then sent to Shawshank prison to server back to back life sentences. While there he meets Red, the only guilty man in Shawshank, and his group of friends that make the time easier. He also meets Boggs and the bull queers who make his life a living hell.  Through the course of actions, Andy begins to accept he is in prison and makes the best of it.  He uses his skills as a banker to do favors for the warden and the guards, and in return he tries to make Shawshank more tolerable for all, by building a library and helping to educate the inmates.  Andy seems content to remain in prison, he has found his niche, then he gets word that there may be evidence that could set him free, when the warden disregards the information, Andy generally goes insane and makes a last ditch effort to get out. The film is a roller coaster of emotions, some comical, some tragic, and in the end total redemption.  I have seen it many times and still come close to tears at points.  Tim Robbins and Morgan Freeman create wonderful characters and should have both won Oscars.  Since this films release it has moved to number 2 on the IMDB.com list, just behind the Godfather.<br />About the DVD: It is sparse, which is to say that it does not have the toys that we have come to know and love from our discs (Behind the scenes, trailers, deleted scenes, directors/actors commentary) this one only has the Theatrical trailer.  Hopefully with this being the 10 year anniversary of The Shawshank Redemption, Warner Brothers will capitalize on the occasion and release a collectors edition rife with all the requisite goodies.<br />T
B000001FLI|5.0|This is one of my favorite Roy Buchanan CDs. It's hard to pin Roy down, he played everything so well -- country, blues, rock, jazz,... you name it -- and moved seamlessly from one genre to another, so for lack of anything more descriptive he is often categorized as a blues guitarist. But while this CD has some superb blues playing on it (esp. &quot;John's Blues&quot;), it also has a number of strictly country cuts, which is why I think it's an excellent intro to Roy for fans of fine country guitar work.<br />As some of the other reviewers here have already noted, nobody before or since has played with the kind of power that Roy did. He was a creative pioneer with first-rate skill who first introduced a number of techniques and effects, however, the thing that sets him apart most was his _unmatched_ ability to capture and express genuine emotion in his playing and make his instrument say something truly meaningful.<br />If you're unfamiliar with Roy Buchanan, this CD will certainly give you an idea why so many superlatives have been used to describe him. But he is really at his best live, so if you are new to Roy and would like to explore further after listening to this CD, I would strongly suggest getting Live Stock and the more  recently released American Axe: Live in 1974 -- both available here on Amazon.
B0000AQS0F|5.0|A minister (who may or may not be a minister), an innocent engineer, a prostitute with more class than the rest of the ship combined, a couple ex-soldiers from the loosing side of the war, a mercenary, a brilliant doctor, a girl who might be crazy, a genius, and/or other but definitely with a huge price on her head, a normal guy pilot. These people do not always get along well. A psychotic, frightening government agency, an enormous and strict military, smugglers, mafia, corrupt governors, brilliant costumes for the rich and dusty streets for the poor. Canibalistic space pirates. Cursing in Chineese. Brutal practicality, and kindness both accidental and dangerous. <br />But wait, there's more! <br />Wowza, and boy am I glad I bought this one. I was a little doubtful; after all, it got canceled and all. But after the pilot I was utterly, completely hooked. I can't believe they got this on TV; and once there I can't believe they let it go. <br />This show is very hard to describe in some ways; I tried adding up the elements in the begining but it's all so much more than the sum of it's parts. I originally bought it because yes, I am a Joss Whedon fangirl. Buffy holds a spot on my DVD shelves, but there's no Buffy here. There is, however, some amazing and slightly experimental cinematography. It works very well. I showed my husband (never a fan of Joss' other work, he has a thing against vampires and teenage shows) the pilot; he was a bit bemused for a while, but watched the next episode, and then the next; and by the third one he was praising this series quite loudly, and I had a smug I-told-you-so feeling. So we loaned it to a firend (who was also somewhat doubtful) and he's going to buy it despite having already watched it. There's now a waiting line of people from my work for our copy. <br />There is a strong western flavor to this, but please don't go &quot;I hate westerns&quot; and dismiss it, because there's so much more as well. For the Chineese alone I would love this series; for the detail taken with the set, and the feel of family, and the characters (especially the engineer Kaylee).
B00005JMJ4|4.0|This movie was not as great as people make it out to be. I liked it enough to make it worthwhile, though. Maybe I missed something.
B00008H2LB|4.0|I own over 80 rock CDs and this is a standout.  It was my first rock CD and it has some great songs, Faint, and things like that.  But Hybrid Theory (also Linkin Park) is a better CD and I'd reccommend it to you long before this one.  They're a great band for sure and they definately hold their own in my collection!  They don't sound like Limp Biskit at all.  If you'd like to try something just a little harder there is another wonderful band, Adema, that you should look into.  Want more music advice? My e-mail is Dumbass5mil@hotmail.com
B00005JM02|5.0|I love this movie and i am willing to say that <BR>Lord Of The Rings 3 can be throwed right in the bin<BR>when it comes to animation cause Finding nemo is pure quality.<br />The good thing about Finding Nemo is that you dont have to wait<BR>about 8 hours before something happens like in the trilogy of Lord Of The Rings.
B00004Z459|5.0|This is the best Linkin Park CD I have (I've also got Meterora).  The combination of nu-metal and rap is musically intreging.  One of the great points to this album: no swearing at all.  If my little sister has friends over or something like that then I've got something to play without worring about lectures on playing appropriate music.  ONE OF THE BEST NU-METAL CDS I OWN.
B0000028UK|5.0|Pearl Jam deserve SO much more than this rating system can even BEGIN to show. I've listened to this album SO much that I know every single pick scratch or feedback sqeuak the guitar puts out. Eddie Vedder has one of the greatest voices ever: PERIOD! This whole album (like most of their albums) can be played through and put on repeat like a billion times. The political lyrics are great  and Aaron Lewis, nor that egotistical Creed puker can TOUCH him. This band shines through in it's genre LONG before bands like Glassjaw and others put foot in the area of this type of guitar styling etc. Ed has the most passionate voice ever. I think if you look mostly anywhere in music today you'll find elements of Ed: look at Nathan Grey of Boysetsfire. I don't know how many singles were squeezed out of this album; but ALL the tracks deserve attention. WMA: GREAT F'N SONG! The opening track: TIGHT AS HELL. ALL the tracks are the tightest thing to happen to music. Needless to say: if you haven't heard of this band yet; get off your f'n ass and check'em out! HAVE YOU LIVED IN A BOX YOUR WHOLE LIFE?!
B00008CLOA|5.0|This is one of the few albums that you can listen to the whole way through, notice i said &quot;you&quot;, i normally skip &quot;on the run&quot;, which is good, but i'm normally to antsy to get on with the cd to sit through it, but its still a good song. once you get to &quot;us and them&quot;, you basically lose track of song changes they all just flow into one another so brilliantly, i especially like the change from 'us and them' to 'any color you like' its just great. This is a great first cd to buy, if you have now other floyd cds. i guess i'd say 'us and them' is my favorite song, even though i used to despise that song, then 'time'. David Gilmour is a genius soloist, all his solos seems so desperate, i dunno how that word came up, but it best describes what i'm trying to say. The way he'll bend notes, and hold em i dunno, it's great, makes you wanna cry, i dunno he has a way of crying through his guitar that makes you wanna hug him, haha, idunno. buy the cd.
B000002H6C|3.0|Contary to popular belief,'...And Justice For All',is not the heaviest Metallica album. Listen to the mix,there is no bass!Anyway.......<br />'...And Justice For All' was Metallica's last album of the 80's.Recorded after Cliff Burton had died, it was always going to be sombre than it's all-out predecssors. This is true, but opener 'Blackened' gets the album off to a thrashy start.It is here the mood and intrcacies come in.This is where the album fails. The band have tried to hard to layer the songs on the album, so they often fall out of touch with themselves as a result. The title track and trach 3,'eye of the Beholder' shos this, and it means the songs are longer, and repeat more to incorporate the new parts. Then comes 'One'. Argurably the finest song they have put there name to, it's a ballad-to-heavy song about a wounded soldier. Hetfields voice and Hammets soloing positivley shine here and it is an undeniably fantastic song.Yet,'Shortest Straw', 'To live is to Die' and 'The Frayed Ends of Sanity' are poor.
B000002U8G|4.0|geez 4 stars hurts soo much, i feel like a jerk for doing this, but i guess i give it four stars because i only listen to &quot;fearless&quot; &quot;san tropez&quot; and &quot;echoes&quot; when i listen to the cd, but those songs are GENIUS, the ones i normally skip are great also, the first song has a nice cresendo, delayed bass intro, hypes you up for whats next (sounds cheesy, yes), one of these days, is a GREAT song, i dont listen to it THAT much, but i really love the slide guitar/lap steel not sure which, they're pretty much the same to me, it gives you that breezy, underwater feeling, pink floyd excells at relaxing music, this is no exception. Fearless is probably my favorite song on the cd, its not smooth like ootd's was, its gets a little harder, bluesy-ish almost, but its still has that slow, laidback tone to it. San Tropez somehow remains breezy without the smoothness, i really like the song, but its not a song most mention when on the topic of this cd. Seamus, is my least favorite song on the cd, its basically a basic blues progression, with a little fanciness added in, while a dog is crooning along, its still a good song, sounds loads more raw than the others. Echoes is a classic, it tests your patience with a piercing _____ sound at the beginning, but once yo uget past that, you'll love it. I love how they make the guitars sound symphonic, as if you're listening to a symphony instead of a few overdubbed guitars, they are geniuses, the few.
B000002HMH|2.0|'Load' is a bad album of bad songs.This would get 1 star, but it's saving grace is 'The Outlaw Torn' and 'Bleeding Me',thus it gets 2 stars for these songs, which are addmitedly brilliant. It's lyrically,musically,and idea-wise (it's a bunch of rock ballads for christs sake!) a bad album. It is uninspired,plodding drivel and should be forgotten about. I respect Metallica for having the gall to change direction so sharply,but they seem to have forgotten what made them special in the first place,i.e being a metal band.It's depressing that a band can progress from starting thrash metal to being a dull mainstream rock band,in about a decade. If you want a '90s (studio) album by Metallica then get 'Metallica' or 'ReLoad'.Anything but this.
B000002U9W|4.0|this was the first cd, i bought of pink floyds, i hadn't heard of any of the songs on the album, but i was bored, and felt like risking it and buying this, instead of &quot;the wall&quot; or &quot;dark side of the moon&quot; (i didn't have neough money for 'the wall' anyways). <br />Atom Heart Mother: my favorite track, the lick (if thats what you'd call it since its being played by a whole orchestra), is so catchy, the second part with the organ/bass/violin is genius, seems carnivalish in a way, like an &quot;italian carnival?&quot; i dunno hard to explain, then it goes into a lap steel solo of sorts, very relaxing. At about 10 minutes into the song it turns bluesy-ish, the bass plays a one-chord line, behind a soloing guitar, chanting ensues, i think. I normally lose patience and skip to the next song then, only if i'm in an hyper mood.<br />If: cathcy song, i like the overdubbed guitars, as i've said of pink floyd before, i really appreciate their thoughtfulness in overdubbing guitars to make their solos that much more beautiful.<br />Summer 68: I used to hate the song, but with repeated listens i can stand more and more of it, a very catchy piano riff, i love gilmours voice, he's the one with softer voice. Like on 'comfortably numb' he's the one who says &quot;when i was a child . . &quot;, waters sings the doctors part &quot;tell me where it hurts. . .&quot;. I like the way they'll share the singing in the songs. Good partnership, however not in this song, gilmour sings it all.<br />Fat Old Sun: I used to not like this song, but after repeated listenings, it really grew on me, reminded me of lynard skynard on downers or something. I only say that because of the slide guitar, they way its sung, and the guitar.<br />Alan's Psychedelic Breakfast: dont think i've ever heard the whole song, i can't get past the food, and talking, i think i didn't listen to it the whole way through once, but i didn't remember it so it must not be that great.<br />Overall: GREAT, buyit, you'll love it, eventually, if not immediately.
B00000FCBC|3.0|I don't really like cover albums, I think it's a waste of time and the sort of album a band on it's last legs releases to try and gain a wider appeal. 'Garage INC' is a decent album, but is just what the above describes. There are some excellent tracks over the 2 CD's, most notably 'Overkill', 'Blitzkreig' and 'Whiskey In the Jar', but these are countered by tracks like 'So What' and 'Stone Cold Crazy'. I think the fact that the best track is'Last Caress/Green Hell',songs first recorded waaaay back in '87, says it all.
B000024D4R|5.0|People have said this was one of pink floyd's most unaccessable albums, however, me and my friend logan, sat down and listened to most of the album, one day, while we were sitting around in my room, we loved it, especially &quot;Dogs&quot;, the guitar solo about 3 minutes into it, is soo beautiful, people need to have more harmonious (can't spell word, does it matter though?, you know what i meant) guitar solos, if more artists would take the time to dub over at least two guitars, i dunno music would be that much better, but music now-a-days doesn't even have good one-guitar solos, so its a kinda dead issue. Gilmour has a kind of smoothness and vibrant sound to his guitar, that makes it sound so great. Roger waters, is a musical genius also, he wrote the lyrics and most of the music, i assume, since his name is next to the titles as being the creator of it all? There was always a big fight amongst that band about stuff like that, i want to go back in time and slap them for that, they could've made more beautiful albums, like this one, if they'd not fallen apart. But of course if i slapped any one of them, i'd have to kill myself. I really like the keyboardist too, i forget his name, but hey man i know youre there, and you kick ass too. I love the pig thats always floating around in all the pictures, i dunno that was soo cool for some reason. Buy it.
B0000TB014|4.0|I like every video on here cept for 2. That was the Smooth Criminal one and the Blood on the dance floor video. Naturally, I don't like BOTDF but the Smooth Criminal was sped up too fast to catch a glimsp of his magic. oh well!
B00005JLYW|1.0|This has to be one of the worst movies ever made. The special effects were great but they were used in the wrong way they made this movie worse not better. Its even hard to write this review there are so many things they did wrong on this movie that i would be doing this all day. The acting was not good either which i do not understand most of these professionals are good at what they do it just blows me away that they would  be in a movie that would hurt there career!! If i were you i would not waste my TIME or MONEY or the 1 1/2 hours to watch this thing. They could have done so much better!!! :(
0446677450|4.0|It is an interesting book. The name of the book Rich Dad Poor Dad has already drawn my attention when shopping the book store. It is different from other investment books. It will also challenge the way you look at life, education, business ownership and money in general. Mr. Kiyosaki discusses his own life and offers a lot of good advice. This book has the ability to motivate you to consider having your own business, and have money work for you versus always working for money.
B00005JMGL|5.0|I thought that peterpanwas brillant and i would 100% go and see it again and i cant wait for it to come out on dvd and video so i can buy it stright away! The whole film was fantastic and the actors are the best my favorite actor out of them would have to be Jeremy Sumpter because he is a cutie and a very talented actor :) but the rest were very good too!
B000063DFS|5.0|This album reads like a greatest hits of Ozzy's career.it starts withe &quot;Mr. Tinkertrain&quot; a hard rockering song, with a strange intro. Then there is &quot;I don't want to change the world&quot; which is a fast song, with some great lyrics. Ozzy slows down on  track three with &quot;Mama I coming home&quot; a nice ballad with a great chorus, this song ( I think)is the best ballad song by Ozzy. &quot;Desire&quot;  has a really interesting guitar part, and also has some great lyrics. The Title Track is Of Course, &quot;No More Tears&quot;. This song is simply great. The album version is nearly 7 and a half minutes, every second worth it. &quot;S.I.N.&quot; good fast song. &quot;Hellraiser&quot; is also good, with some great guitar work. &quot; Time After Time&quot; is okay, kinda of a ballad. &quot;Zombie Stomp&quot; has some intersting usical effects at the beginning and end of the song, the song has a sort of early 80s Ozzy sound. &quot;A.V. H.&quot; Starts off with a lttle guitar strumming, but quickly hits with a big roc sound. &quot;Road To Nowhere&quot; another semi-balladsong, but a good way to end the album. The two new re-issue songs are &quot;Don't Blame Me&quot; and &quot;Party with Animals&quot;.Both songs could have been easily  been on the album, both fast and loud. To sum up this album, it  has some great rock songs , and a few ballads. This would be the best start to getting to know Ozzy's music. If you like the 80s style Ozzy get Blizzard of Ozz
B00000I14Z|5.0|There are three albums that make up my introduction to jazz records. Time Further Out by the Brubeck Quartet was first. Next was Monk's Underground LP. Then I'm diggin' this great album cover with the cubist painting and what a great title Goodbye Pork Pie Hat, a selection from the Mingus Ah Um masterpiece. In no time I'm so crazy over Mingus, I start buying everything I can find by him and shortly after that I caught him live at 2-Saints, a small...No, make that a tiny club on St Marks Place. During intermission I even found myself standing next to this jazz titan at the pizzaria on the corner of St Marks & 3rd...Having a slice with Mingus....Man, what a night that was!!! <br />Back to Ah Um...It's a seminal jazz recording. In my opinion as vital as anything by Elington, Monk or Miles. Pork Pie Hat is at least as great as Round Midnight, Sophisticated Lady or Funny Valentine. If you don't own this one in your jazz collection...you've got a lot of explaining to do!
0385504209|1.0|The Da Vinci Code is quite honestly the worst book I have ever had the misfortune of reading.  Dan Brown's success results only from his discussion of the Holy Grail and an interpretation of that mystery which most people have never heard.  That is where the merit of this novel ends.  It is bascially a cookie-cutter novel in the mold of a Michael Crichton or Nelson DeMille novel without the former's frighteningly believeable scenarios or the latter's character depth.  Mr Brown's writing is about on par with Danielle Steele; he tries to manufacture suspense when none is necessary, and key plot points are disapointingly predicatable.<br />The complete lack of style would not have bothered me had it not been for his argument for moral relativism.  When I say this work is heretical I am not referring to his treatment of Mary Magdalene.  Personally I dont think what he has to say about her is too theologically important.  What bothers me is that he makes the same argument Kevin Lomax makes in Devil's Advocate, an argument that denies the existence of right and wrong.  By having people take part in pagan rituals, and then anouncing they are practicing the correct form of christianity suppressed by the catholic church, he reveals his disgustingly relativistic outlook.  Brown is just one more whiner blaming the catholic church for all of the world's problems and is unable to get even his own facts straight(see the review &quot;Constantine spoke English&quot;).  His argument that the church has suppressed &quot;Goddess&quot; worship for two thousand years is ludicrous.  Has he ever heard of the cult of the Virgin?  It is no mistake that their is no mention of Notre Dame in his description of Paris.  The most famous Cathedral in the world being named after a woman is a serious blow to his argument.  Keep in mind that the reverence catholics held for Mary is one of the key complaints many protestant groups voiced before splitting from the church.
6304806442|5.0|This breakthrough film from director Danny Boyle (The Beach, 28 Days Later) was an international hit that deserves all the critical acclaim it garnered and helped launch the career of actor Ewan McGregor.  Adapted from the acclaimed novel by Irvine Welsh, Trainspotting tells the story of Renton (McGregor), Spud (Ewen Bremner), Sick Boy (Johnny Lee Miller), and Tommy (Kevin McKidd); four Scottish heroin addicts in the wake of &quot;choosing life, or choosing not to choose life&quot;.  Director Boyle and screenwriter John Hodge manage to transfer what is an unfilmable book to film thanks to the off the wall hyperkinetic humor and the brilliant cast.  Robert Carlyle's performance as the fight provoking, hard drinking Begbie is excellent as he goes from humerous to frightening in the snap of a finger.  While Trainspotting isn't an ode to heroin, it is not a warning about the drug or drugs in general period.  The film sucessfully presents all the otherworldly pleasure and excruciating pain that goes with addiction, and like the later made Requiem for a Dream, this is a film that can be hard to watch and is definitely not for everyone.  As a previous reviewer stated, it's your choice.  The DVD has no extras at all, hopefully someday Miramax will have the good sense to re-release Trainspotting with the host of extras that it so deserves.
B0001HAISQ|5.0|When I first saw this movie in the Cinamas I was blown away! I thought it would be just like the Cartoon with a bit of Hook, but the way they shot the movie it actually felt that Never Land was real. Jeremy Stumpter was amazing as Peter Pan, I dont think anyone else could fill in that role then him. Hes a heartthrob girls, Watch Out.<br />Peter Pan is a GREAT movie of all ages and something the whole family can enjoy. This is why I gave it 5 stars, you can't rate it untill you see the Magic in this movie.

0553212753|5.0|This book is just as much fun to read at the age of 33 as it is at 13.  I laughed out loud and stifled sobs throughout the book as we watch the four March girls - Jo, Meg, Amy and Beth - turn from young girls to young wives.  As I read, I worried that that description sounded a bit boring although it really is an entertaining book.  Then it dawned on me that, as each chapter is a small vignette from the progress of their lives, this is a lot like watching Little House on the Prairie. This would be an exceptional book to read to children and is quite enjoyable for women of all ages to read for themselves.<br />It was a bit of a blow when reading the afterword to find that Louisa Alcott did not like the book. She had been pressured into writing it by her publisher and regarded it as \\"moral pap for the young\\", calling the first part \\"The Pathetic Family\\" and writing an alternative second part she called \\"Happy Women\\" in which the sisters flourished in professional careers in a community of spinsters. \\"Good Wives\\" obviously won out and I can't say that I am not happy about that.<br />One thing the book and the afterword did do is awaken an interest in Louisa May Alcott herself. This might be a wonderful place to start on a women's study given the disparity between the work produced and the authors ideals.<br />Whether you are interested in reading it for sheer enjoyment or as a \\"jumping off point\\" for broader studies, you will enjoy the book. It is almost impossible not to.
B00006RIO7|5.0|This is a great soundtrack except for the 3 bonus songs, Class, Cell Block Tango (Queen Latifah &amp; LiL' Kim) and Love is a Crime. I love all of the other songs though! Here is my rating of them all.<BR>1. Overature/And All That Jazz- I love this song, Catherine Zeta-Jones has a great voice!<br />2.Funny Honey- Who would've thought Renee Zellweger could sing!? <br />3.When You're Good To Mama- Queen Latifah is amazing, and I love the music!<br />4.Cell Block Tango- Probably my favorite, good lyrics and amazing music!<br />5.All I Care About Is Love- Richard Gere is good, but on the movie it sounds better for some reason.<br />6.We Both Reached For The Gun- This is a funny song, I like it!<br />7.Roxie- Another great song sung by Renee Zellweger!<br />8.I Can't Do It Alone- On the CD, this song isn't that great because you can't see CZJ dancing, &amp; there aren't many lyrics.<br />9.Mister Cellophane- A sweet, sad song, John C. Reily is perfect for the song <br />10.Razzle Dazzle- Razzle Dazzled me! <br />11.Class- An OK song, didn't blow me away. <br />13.Nowadays/Hot Honey Rag- Upbeat fun instrumental song!<br />14.I Move On- There is a reason this song won an Oscar! It was just great! <br />15.After Midnight- I like this number!<br />16.Roxie's Suite- I like this number too!<br />17.He had It Comin'- Awful compared to the original! How did a R&amp;B number get on this CD!? <br />18.Love is A Crime- Pretty bad too! Why did they put these songs on the CD?
B00005JMJ4|5.0|This is a great film!  A lot of the reviewers here don't like it for two main reasons:  they thought it was a comedy and it's NOT, and/or they didn't like the way it depicted Japanese culture.<br />First, I'm going to address those two things.  It was marketed as a comedy-- big mistake.  Although I laughed at times, this movie is a subtle exploration of two people out of there norms, lonely, and -- well, \\"lost\\" is the right word.  It is absolutely not a comedy and it's too bad that the guys who market these things tried to make it out as one.  Now about all you people who think it's all racist or whatever-- I think it's quite obvious that it's not trying to put Japanese in a bad light, and I also don't think it does.  It simply portrays them in the way that most Americans would relate to if they were there.  The main characters are American and the sotry is about them and how they view things.  Like in the elevator, Bill Murray is the tallest guy there and he's not a tall guy by our standards.  Two of my firends who have been to Japan said \\"oh my God I know exaclty how that feels.\\"  When the Japanese try to speak English and get some of the L's and R's wrong--well, they do get it wrong.  The movie didn't make you laugh about that, it just said that they do that.  A lot of people just happened to think it's funny.  It's not necessarily funny, but it is necessarily accurate.   I know if I was trying to talk Japanese a lot of people would be laughing at me!  Also, I thought it did many things to portray Japanese positively.  I can't name specific things off hand, but I did think all the Japanese characters were very fun and interesting and the movie made me want to visit Japan, which I previously had absolutely no desire to do.<br />Now then, back to the movie.  It's a wonderful movie!  The part of Bob must have been written specificly for Bill Murray because he is absolutely amazing.  I don't know how to describe it any better than that.  The girl, whose name I know but know I will mispell it, also did a fantastic job in her role.  So basically, good casting.  It was also a very fun movie for just identifying with loneliness and hoping to connect.  And although there's that romantic aspect of meeting a stranger in an exotic place and there is some sexual tension because they are different sexes, the movie is about friendship.  I really liked that fact.  It has been a long damn time since a movie had two characters that weren't the same sex and didn't get it on.  The only thing that kind of pissed me off was the fact that, without ruining it for somebody who hasn't seen it, sex was the thing Sofia chose to be the event that it was (no the characters didn't do it) rather than having something else serve that purpose, since the relationship between the two main characters was about friendship and not necessarily romantic.  But it was forgiven when they also came to that conclusion during the fire alarm, and it also brought up the question about if guys and girls really be just friends.<br />I hope I have cleared a few things up and given a decent review of the movie as a movie, unlike many reviewers.  I also hope that this helps those of you who don't knwo whether or not to see it.  Obviously it's not for everbody but I think it's a damn good movie and highly recommended.  (And it's certainly much better than the god aweful Virgin Suicides!)
B00008H2LB|5.0|All you people dissing LP are probably people who listen to mindless music like Slipknot or ICP because thats &quot;real heavy metal&quot;. Well in my opinion, its just &quot;real mindless and stupid&quot;. LP is heavy at times, light at other times, but the difference is they know what their doing and how to put together songs that have energy and emotion without going on a mindless screaming spree.
0385510438|4.0|I thought this was Grisham's best book in years. He captured the spirit of the 70s in the deep south while giving the darker aspects those difficult times a light touch. His quirky characters (one of the things he does best)were well written. And, for those of us who loved &quot;A Time to Kill,&quot; it was interesting to compare characters in this loose &quot;prequel.&quot;
B00008J4P5|3.0|I do like this CD, but its not amazing. People say the lyrics are clever, well in a way they are, but they also sound a little outdated and corny too (the last song had me cracking up with how stupid it was). Jack White is an awesome guitar player, I'll give him that. Very creative and fun to listen to. Meg White on the other hand... not a very good drummer. She can keep a beat, but sometimes she sounds extremely off tone (ex: the chorus of Seven Nation Army). The best songs are Seven Nation Army, Black Math, Hardest Button To Button and Little Acorns.
B00007GZQI|5.0|I do not believe this movie is to be seen in a straight forward manner with actors, a story, etc.  This is a psychedelic-symbolic film depicting discordian experimentation with capitalism using humor and not-so-subtle inferences to motivate the viewer to see things their way.  <br />If you are looking for linear narritive with quick modern MTV style cuts and action, you will be sorely disappointed.<br />If you are looking for a strange series of vignettes exploring the outer limits of capitalism with iconoclastic and psychedelic humor... then you've found your film.
B00008HCCF|3.0|I want to start this with a disclaimer - I am a big Norah Jones fan. I love Come Away With Me and enjoy Feels Like Home, but that's another review. I agree with just about everything positive that's been said about the video portion of this DVD, especially the lingering close ups on the instrumentalists and of course Ms. Jones. As for her performace, well, it's been said before - live performing isn't her strong suit. <br />I want to make the point, in contrast to others it seems, that the audio on this DVD is terrible. No, it's not like experiencing a good live session either. The mix is very poor on most tracks. Typically the drums are far too loud and the acoustic guitar is nearly lost, although some cuts are better than others. <br />The worst, however, is the recording of Norah's vocals (not the vocal performance itself). Easily the worst job of capturing a vocal I've ever heard. She sounds like she's standing 5 feet away from the mike in an empty, echoing auditorium ill-suited for sound. This is probably not so much the mix as it is miking that seems to be capturing at least as much reflecting sound as direct but I'm just a listener, not an audio engineer. For two very different examples of good quality miking and mix of live performances try James Taylor's Live at the Beacon Theatre or Roy Orbison's Black and White Night.<br />This must explain why the DVD is so cheap. For Jones fans, in spite of the poor job on the audio portion of this dvd it's probably still worth the purchase.
B0000AFQS0|5.0|I've had this DVD for two weeks and I am very pleased, especially with the 2nd disc Special Features.  I like being able to isolate the \\"Bass\\" line on two songs and changing camera angles.  While my family had lived within earshot of the 1967 Monterey Pop festival, I didn't know much about \\"The Who\\" until I saw this movie. I viewed \\"Tommy\\" and \\"The Kids Are Alright\\" as a double feature in Seattle.  Every time the WHO appeared on the screen, the audience would jump up and yell (especially when the film broke during \\"Tommy\\")!  I remarked to the woman sitting next to me that \\"I'd never been in a riot before.\\" The recent commercialization of The Who's music (The CSI TV Shows, Hummer Commercials etc.)reminded me how great they were, so I ordered this DVD.  I am not disappointed. The clearity of the picture and the stereo sound is great and there's no film to break or video to fade!
B00005AQE8|4.0|If it wasn't for &quot;What'z Ya Phone Number,&quot; it would be a 5 star album and disk 1 wouldn't possess one bad song.  There isn't a shadow of a doubt that this is the best hip hop album of all-time and one of music's finest albums altogether.  Growing up when this fine piece of recording art came out I was hoping he'd release &quot;Can't C Me&quot; as a single, seeing that it's my favorite song on the CD, but I Ain't Mad At Ya Pac.  The DPG version of &quot;Can't C Me&quot; is a can't miss also.  When it comes to an album's depth, &quot;All Eyez On Me&quot; is music's 2004 Sacramento Kings.  It's such a dynamic album that even Nas had to blatantly steal the beat from &quot;All Eyez On Me&quot; for one of his songs just so rap fans could say, &quot;Ooh, he came hot on a track.&quot;  Well newsflash rap fans, Nas, Jay-Z, and Puffy are all talentless thieves, jacking 2pac for soundbites.  The bottom line is that &quot;All Eyez On Me&quot; from top to bottom squashes 98% of all rap albums with it's combo of amazing beats and script-flipping lyrics.
B00006FR47|4.0|I have been a long time Chicago fan. (Since the mid 70's)<br />A lot has already been said about this album already and, if you but this CD, more in the liner notes.  Here is my input.  Listen to the bass line in this album and you can tell you are listening to true musicians.  When you listen to \\"Goodbye\\" you realize that Peter Cetera's talent goes beyond the high voiced pop singer.  Peter is also the bass player and the bass lines here are very intricate.  In my opinion this is the one Chicago album that appeals to the more serious musician. Even though it includes \\"Saturday in the Park\\" one of their biggest top 40 hits.
0385504209|5.0|This is an excellent novel--both a thrilling mystery and an enlightening and fresh view on the Church and Jesus Christ. It will only take you a few hours to read this page turner and it just might change your entire perspective on religion, the church, and life(!) You will not regret reading this fabulous book, take it from this more than satisfied fan!
B00008EYA5|2.0|S.W.A.T. is a typical summer action movie - several big set pieces with little coherent plot or character development.  As such, it succeeds fairly well.  Samuel L. Jackson stars as the team head, Sgt. Hondo, who returns to the force to help burnish the tarnished image of the Los Angeles S.W.A.T.  He assembles a team of misfits, including Colin Farrell and Michelle Rodriquez, and LL Cool J.  The team trains and is thrown into the field just as an international crime figure (Olivier Martinez) is captured in LA and is to be transported to a remote dessert prison.  This transport mission is complicated greatly when the fugitive offers $100 million to anyone who can free him.<br />The movie features a few good action scenes, including a Lear jet trying to take off from a bridge, and the dialogue includes a few funny jokes.  However, S.W.A.T. never gains much traction, largely because of the generic characters and plot.  TV director Clark Johnson (The Shield, Third Watch) helms, and his apparent lack of vision is a major debit.  With such a great cast, a good basic plot idea, and a large budget, S.W.A.T. should have been fantastic, but it ends up being a disappointment that will likely be forgotten quickly.<br />Extras: A potentially fun commentary track with the director and cast (sans Colin Farrel) goes nowhere as the director obviously recorded his commentary separately from the cast.  The result is a disjointed and joyless commentary track.
B000003TAR|5.0|In my opinion i like this album better than Nevermind, dont get me wrong Nevermind is a top quality album but a lot of my favourite Nirvana songs are on this album such as Serve The Servants, Rape Me, Dumb, Radio Friendly Unit Shifter, All Apologies, Frances Farmer Will Have Her Revenge On Seattle, Pennyroyal Tea etc.. Buy this album if you call yourself a Nirvana fan as this is a legendary Nirvana album
B0000CABBW|5.0|This movie is completely underrated.  Keisha Castle-Hughes is being nominated for Best Actress in this year's Academy Awards for her brilliant performance as Pai.  This young newcomer to the film world has a wonderfully natural ability to bring warmth and honesty to her character despite having no acting experience at all.     This is the story of a young girl's impression on her Maori tribesmen and family.  Born to a line of Chieftains who date their heritage back to the mythical Whale Rider Paikeia, young Pai is the unexpected and shunned heir to her family lineage when her mother and twin brother die in childbirth.  After painfully losing his wife and boy, the chief's eldest son relinquishes his obligations for tribal leader and departs the country to follow his own ambitions, leaving young Pai to be raised by her grandparents in New Zealand.     Koro, the tribe leader, eventually grows to love young Pai, but never truly accepts her as part of the family.  As a girl she's useless to him.  In order to maintain the traditions of his heritage that had been passed down through generations of first-born males, he decides to take matters into his own hands by training the young boys of his village in a vain search for a new chief.  Young Pai proudly embraces all the traditions of her culture despite her grandfather's forbidding because she loves him uncondtionally.  It isn't until the end that Koro discovers the answer he was looking for had always been right in front of him.     Other people who've seen this film were expecting more flash and bang based on the reviews, but I thought the temperament of the story was just right.  This was honest and mild yet emotionally powerful.
B000003TA4|5.0|Let me firstly say if you like this album then go buy all of Nirvana's other albums or atleast In Utero and Bleach. This album is simply superb, the song quality you get track after track is incredible, it has so many hit songs on this album, including Smells Like Teen Spirit(although I think it is over-rated), In Bloom, Come As You Are, Lithium. Akthough i think although those songs are good songs i think some of the other songs are just as good and some even better like Breed, Polly, Drain You, Lounge Act, Something In The Way etc... I think you should go buy this CD if your a fan of this kinda music because every track on this album is quality.
0345452577|2.0|Is this reall written by Kellerman??  Why do authors DO this; abandon a character that the public likes....see Patricia Cornwell's HORRIBLE Isle of Dogs when she dropped Kay Scarpetta...where are Alex Delaware and Milo Sturgis??  One reviewer referrred to them as &quot;stale&quot; ???  Not to me; I want more.  I'm glad I checked this out at the library instead of wasting my money.  I hope he or his staff reads these reviews,  This character is weak and the whole story is simply NOT what I was expecting.  Mr. Kellerman  please bring back Dr. Delaware!!!!!
B00009W0U1|2.0|THere are few films that actually make me sick to my stomach, and this is one of them.  The violence is so graphic - there is one scene where you can count how many teeth a man loses as his head is slowly bashed in - that I simply had to fast forward it OFTEN.  Really, it made me heave, near vomiting.  Then, there is the horror at the center of the plot, the fate of a beautiful and happy young woman.<br /><br />Now there was a time in my youth when I would have relished my &#34;reaction,&#34; feeling that such a film made me &#34;experience&#34; a new reality, etc.  All the artistic longings - often nonsense in retrospect - of the inexperienced.  Well, I am afraid that life has made me no longer want to see such things.  I have had friends who suffered similar things and there is nothing to learn from it and no value is bringing it to the screen in my opinion.  However, it does make the film controversial - look at the range of reviews here!<br /><br />Because of the odd way that the film is edited, I am not revealing the plot here.  Indeed, with the camera waving around in an attempt at avant garde technique, it added to my nausea.  Nonetheless, the acting is very very good.  Moreover, there are philosophical points throughout the whole thing and they are not totally pretentious, but add to the portrayal of life and love in the film.  The chemistry between the actors is totally believable, as is the changes in personality.<br /><br />Am I a bourgeois philistine for saying that it was simply awful to watch?  Perhaps, but maybe I have just outgrown this kind of art thing.  I think you can get deep philosophy and thoughtfulness without such total horror.<br /><br />Not recommended.
0140288503|5.0|On October 3, 1993, less than a year after President Clinton began his first term as President of the United States and almost eight years before Sept. 11, 2001, a small force of U.S. Army Rangers and members of the elite Delta Force were helicoptered into the heart of Mogadishu, Somalia's war-torn capital, in a daring daylight raid to capture two of Somali clan leader Mohamed Farrah Aidid's top lieutenants.  The plan was simple -- drop four &quot;chalks&quot; of Rangers to secure a perimeter around the target building (near the Olympic Hotel) while the Delta commandos -- the D-Boys, as the Rangers referred to them -- gathered the prisoners.  Then they'd be exfiltrated by a convoy of armed humvees and trucks and whisked back to the U.S. Army base in Mogadishu International Airport.<br />But, as General of the Army (and later President) Dwight Eisenhower once said, no military plan ever survives intact once the first shots are fired, so instead of a quick in-and-out raid, the 100 men of Task Force Ranger found themselves in the middle of a hostile and anarchic sector of Mogadishu known as the Bukara Market (and also as &quot;the Black Sea&quot;), engaged in what was, until the recent war in Iraq, the most sustained and deadly firefight in American military annals since Vietnam.<br />Mark Bowden, a long-time reporter for the Philadelphia Inquirer, chronicles the harrowing &quot;Battle of the Black Sea&quot; in his bestselling book Black Hawk Down: A Story of Modern War with a fine eye for detail, a crisp and gripping narrative, and without bias toward either the Somalis or the Americans involved in the 18-hour firefight that left 18 American soldiers dead, over 70 wounded, and hundreds of Somali casualties.  Despite having had no prior military experience or even any expertise on defense issues, Bowden has written a non-fiction work that joins such works as Cornelius Ryan's A Bridge Too Far and Lt. Gen. Hal Moore's We Were Soldiers Once...and Young as a true classic of military history.f military history.
0451526015|5.0|Oscar Wilde's The Picture of Dorian Gray is a story of a handsome young man and his transformation from innocence to vile, wickedness.  The story is set in London, England in the late 1800's.  Through his acquaintances and a little wish his life is changed.  Dorian's personality and manners alter drastically and thus, he begins his downfall. The novel is very descriptive and uses philosophical themes.  The use of language is extraordinary and some of the things discussed in the novel really make you think.  The story is very morbid and cynical, but beautifully done.  At times though, the descriptions and philosophical jibber-jabber can be a bit overdone.  Still, I liked this novel and would recommend it to anyone.  Once I started reading this, it was hard to put the book down.
B00009V7RF|5.0|'Elephunk' is an awesome album. This is one of the first albums I can listen to, in it's entirtey, without having to skip any tracks. Whether I'm listening to the upbeat 'Smells Like Funk', the sultry 'Sexy' or even the angst-filled 'Anxiety' I can always find something about the song to love. Adding Fergie for a female voice was an ingenius move. She really adds alot to the group when singing songs such as 'Let's Get Retarded' and 'Shut Up'. <br />Just so everyone buying the album for 'Hey Mama' knows, the lyrics were changed on the single version to avoid sounding too political (\\"then drop bombs like we're in the Middle East\\" was cut) and to add more of Fergie (her \\"off the richter\\" lyrics are not part of the CD version). Both versions basically sound the same other than the slightly altered lyrics though. <br />The first six tracks are all quite fast, then 'Latin Girls' slows it down quite a bit. 'The Apl Song' is one of my very favorites on the album. I absolutely love the lines \\"A version of my ghetto where life felt for real/Some would call it hell but to me it was heaven\\". The song is sung in both Tagalog and English, which sounds awesome. It's about having to work together and live off the land, and it truly is a very beautiful song.<br />Check out 'Elephunk' if you're a fan of Hip Hop, or even Pop. If you like 'Shut Up' and 'Hey Mama', chances are you'll love the album. The lyrics, vocals, and beats are all very good, and the album overall is awesome.

B000084T18|2.0|Words cannot even describe how grateful I am for not buying this album. I borrowed it from a friend, and was appalled by how bad it is. I don't even want to think about what our world is coming to when 50 Cent has become the biggest thing in the music world. You know his music's bad when he attempts as hard as he can to be \\"street\\" and \\"tuff\\", and still fails miserably. Personally, I want to listen to music with substance, or at least to a musician who's honest about their talent and their music. I really have no respect for self-proclaimed \\"pimps\\" and \\"gangstas\\". I would much rather listen to educated artists who know how to spell and rap intelligibly. Honestly, I can't understand a word this moron sings, which is probably a good thing unless I wanted to hear about how rich he is, how \\"pimpin'\\" he is, how many \\"hos\\" he's slept with, or how he plans to shoot me. <br />Wow, 50's been shot nine times? That must mean his album is \\"off da hook\\" (as all the pre-pubescent 50 Cent fans would say). Wrong. This is crap. I'll admit, being shot nine times and living to tell about it is quite a feat, but it doesn't make you a rapper. It seems like anyone who has this supposed \\"cred\\" that comes with being shot or having been in jail is getting signed. What bull. Honestly, let's all go out and try to get shot so we can become famous rappers with \\"bling bling\\" and million dollar homes. <br />50 Cent even looks like a fraud. The genius probably thought up the sleeve of his album all by himself. A great picture of himself looking hard and \\"gangsta\\", with a bullethole right through the middle. Why a bullethole? Just in case anyone forgets he's been shot, what was it again? Oh, yeah, nine times. Seriously 50, get over yourself. If the only crap you have to rap about is being shot, being a \\"gansta\\", being a \\"pimp\\", all the women you've slept with, and all the \\"wankstas\\" who hate you then you really have a pretty sorry life and a pretty pathetic amount of talent. The only reason I gavethis album two stars rather than one is because the beats are pretty good (courtesy of Eminem and Dr. Dre of course, there's no way someone as unintelligent as 50 Cent could've come up with them).<br />Go out and buy some Tupac, Run-DMC, or Notorious B.I.G., not only can you understand them, they actually have talent, and intelligent things to say. Even Eminem is better than this crap, he actually has opinions on serious issues. 'Get Rich or Die Trying'? Well it looks like you don't have to wait for that tenth shot to finish you off 50, you've surely earned enough money from all those people out there who actually buy into this sort of \\"image\\" to live lavishly for quite some time.

B0000CDLA7|4.0|I can understand why so many people are talking badly about this album.  It is Dream Theaters angry album.  On first listen, this one is quite different from others.  It is fast, heavy, angry, and the highlight of the album is guitar.  Generally when you think of DT, you think of a balance between heavy, light, and dazzling keyboard sounds all over.  That balance is gone with this one.  Keyboards are still used, but they are basically in unison with the guitar sounds, except for certain points.  I would argue though, that musically, everything that DT stands for is still present.  Extreme technicallity, shifting time signitures, soaring vocals, ripping guitar solos, and everything else.  The difference is, that in order to appreciate this one, you have to enjoy brutal music.  That is what seperates this from others.  They are all metal, but this is &quot;headbanging&quot; music.<br />I would like to touch on the nu-metal references now.  I do not understand how anyone could classify this album like this.  Everyone is entitled to an opinion, but I would like for someone to point out one nu-metal band that produces music like this.  It does not happen.  There are a few riffs that might remind you of it, but this is still definate Dream Theater.  In conclusion, this is still a great DT album.  I personally feel that some of their previous work has lost it a little bit as far as musicality, which has returned with this one.  Just because it is heavy, it does not mean that it can't be musical.  I strongly urge that any fan of progressive metal check it out, but make sure that you know what to expect so that this purchase is not a let-down.
0385504209|5.0|I could not put this book down.  Although his writng style has never been one of my favorites, this book is outstanding!
0440180295|4.0|Kurt Vonnegut's Slaughterhouse Five is about a writer (Vonnegut himself) who is writing about a book about an optometrist/WWII vet who regularly converses with aliens. Yes, it's a writer who writes about another writer, whose writings are based on the original writer's war experiences. <br />Billy Pilgrim, the protagonist of said novel, is unstuck in time, which basically means that he relives old memories in a seemingly random order. He is totally unfit for war, yet he is forced into service to fight in World War II. Vonnegut's novel within a novel details Billy's experiences before, during, and after the war. During the war, Billy sees many things that would be considered heroic by many, yet Vonnegut portrays these would-be heroes as ridiculous and obnoxious. <br />The book has a clear anti-war message, but ultimately, it states that war is inevitable. Vonnegut brings his book to a filmmaker, who states that being anti-war is like being anti-glacier; you can dislike it, but it's going to happen anyway. When a death in the novel occurs, Billy Pilgrim's only response is, \\"so it goes,\\" which reflects on his powerlessness in his situation. He may not like what occurs around him, but he cannot do anything to stop it, and so he accepts the way things are.<br />Slaughterhouse Five is written well, but it is rather difficult to keep up with because of all the changes in setting. There are several settings Billy is unstuck in, such as America during the Vietnam War and Billy as a prisoner of war during the firebombing of Dresden. Also, Billy's encounters on the alien planet Tralfamadore are just strange. Despite this, Vonnegut's message is clear, and it is articulated in an interesting, albeit perplexing manner.
0385504209|5.0|I can't tell potential readers anything more about the story than other reviewers have covered here, but I do want people to know they need to take a trip to see the places mentioned in the book. Use DaVinci Code as a travel guide. Seeing the Monna Lisa, the floors in the Louvre, the frescoes, and the churches makes the book mean so much more. So many more truths are out there.

The children begin to miss their parents, and in their unique ways make plans of escape. Will it all work well, and will they escape the man set on robbing them? Lemony Snicket introduces us to a series of unfortunate events, a great read for all ages. If you enjoy reading or not, these are really good!
B00003CXE7|2.0|personally i think it's boring. but i gave it 2 stars anywayzzz. cuz some parts of it was actually pretty awesome. but i was just kinda half asleep when i was watchin' it.
B00018D44U|2.0|I have to join the chorus and tell the truth. These songs are well crafted, layered, sophisticated... and boring. It starts off with \\"Sunrise,\\" the only worthwile tune on the CD (and the only reason I gave this two stars). Then, well, it just get's bland and stays that way for the rest of the cd. It isn't that the songs all sound alike; they're just not that interesting. And they get even less interesting with repeated plays. If this cd were food, it would be flavorless oatmeal - no cream, no brown sugar, no raisins... just blah.
0385504209|1.0|This proves again that insulting and falsifying Christianity is big business, and that asnti-Christianity is one form of politically-acceptable bigotry. Funny, no-one writes books insulting Islam for some reason.<br />Christianity doesn't need me to defend it, but I'm offended that this book is being passed off as some sort of insight into history and theology when it is neither. It is garbage for the gulliable, or more precisely, for the half-educated and those who passed through school and university after history and theology ceased being taught there.<br />To quote another reviewer: &quot;Same old lies. Hardly any of this background is original. Most of it is derived from the fantasy-disguised-as-history work 'Holy blood, Holy Grail,' and the rest is cobbled from other bits of well-worn and risible muggests of esoteric and Gnostic conspiracy theories.&quot;<br />The Catholic Church is shown as brutal, repressive and murderous. I am not a Catholic, so I have no particular reason to take offense, except that all this untruth should be offensive to anyone, and I feel angry on behalf of the many good Catholics I know. Its attitude to Catholicism and Christianity is simply vicious bigotry.<br />Among the ludicrous historical errors presented as part of the factual back-ground are the alleged facts that the Divinity of Christ was invented by the Roman Emperor Constantine, and voted on at the Council of Nicea.<br />There is a claim the Church killed five million accused witches during the medieval period. This is also utterly, ludicrously false.<br />This is a frankly degenerate work - it is not even well-written as a suspense thriller - aiming to exploit the gulliability of the modern half-educated and its success is a depressing comment on the state of our civilization.
B000099T2L|5.0|I've never really been a fan of Destiny's Child but my husband is so in love with Beyonce that I had to give her CD a try... I have to say I am very impressed with each song on the CD. My favorite is the last song {15} called Daddy where she pays tribute to her father. I thought it was simply beautiful... <br />Keep up the good work `B'...
B000099T2L|1.0|This album really sucks. Beyonce herself has no talent at all. Her voice is really artificial and very horrible. The songs are even worse! The only slightly better song is Baby Boy, but it still isn't very good. <br />I would actually give this record 0 stars. I have no idea why Beyonce won any Grammys at all.
B00018D44U|5.0|Norah Jones' sophmore effort is a lovely musical landscape. It's plain enchanting and mesmerizing melodic pop at its very finest. Why all these &quot;Norah groupies&quot; such as Dolly Parton(who I like on her own turf)have been allowed to suck up NORAH's moments in the light is beyond reason, as Dolly had three decades, if not four, of nonstop successes. Maybe NORAH's astonishing ability to sell 18 Million copies of her debut ALL BY HERSELF caused some of these other artists to sweet talk her into a guest appearance just for the sake of acquiring exposure for their own gain. This is a beautifully produced recording and would be better with only NORAH JONES singing all the lyrics by herself - after all - NORAH JONES is the STAR here and it's her turn! Hopefully, on the next album, NORAH JONES will be the only singer featured.

B00006CXXU|4.0|Xtina is truly in a class of her own. I was an average Xtina fan until I heard this CD & then I became & huge fan. Xtina puts Britney, Beyonce, Ashanti & those other so called singers to shame. If she can back away form the \\"I'm A Whore\\" image, Xtina will definitely become a icon if she isn't one already one.The album starts off with an interlude that could've been made into one song (add on Stripped pt. 2). Every song on this album is great except for Underappreciated & Make Over which in my opinion could've been left on the cutting room floor.The standout tracks in my opinion are \\"Impossible\\" which X-tina teams up with the very talented Alicia Keys for a soulful banger. \\"Loving Me 4 Me\\" lets us see the romantic & softer side of Xtina that is beautifully done. \\"The Voice Within\\" shows Xtina at her best vocally. If you want to hear some true talent, then definitely pick this one up!
B0000507PC|5.0|I've seen this film only once, in the theater when it was released.  I haven't yet read the book.  This movie touched me in a way I can't explain, even to those who saw it with me.  I'm now ordering the video.  It's one of those film experiences where you have to remove yourself from the current  world as you know it, and take in everything as it happened at the time.It's not easy to do, but there was a time when everything that happened here, happened. I love this movie. That's all.
B00008EYA5|5.0|Swat was a really awesome movie.  It had so much action in it.  Definetl one of the best movies of 2003.  Its about a druglord offering 100 million dollars to whoever gets him out of jail.  That offer causes problems for the swat team (played by Colin Farell, ll Cool J, and Michelle Rodriguez) who must transport him to a federal prison.  This movies is fun to watch.  I highly suggest this film.
B00006BXI0|5.0|Symphony X is one of the best progressive metal bands around today. Most fans consider this album to be the band's best. The music is very diverse with many influences, from classical to metal and progressive rock, and at times they throw a bit of jazz into the mix. The vocalist, Russel Allen, at times, sounds like Dio, but overall has a very unique operatic voice. In fact, I'd say that it's safe to say he has one of the greatest set of pipes in any genre today. He'd yet to find his signature sound that he achieves on later albums, but due to the production value, he still sounds magnificent. Michael Romeo, the band's shred-master is a standout among the band's standouts and most of the musical highlights include interaction between him and Mike Pinnella, the keyboardist. They together achieve some complex though accoustically pleasing solos perfectly interwoven in a quilted and layered soundscape. The drumming and bass playing are also excellently performed, and the mastering on this album is nothing short of perfect. All of the drum pieces are expertly captured and mixed, which is needed in this music genre. Every track on the album is a winner, though there are a few that deserve to be mentioned in detail.<br />&quot;Of Sins and Shadows&quot; - this track wonderfully starts off the album with a sonic onslaught that reminds me immediately of Pantera. One of the heaviest songs on the album, it is also one of the best.<br />&quot;Sea of Lies&quot; - This and the following track, &quot;Out of the Ashes&quot; both serve up a vocal centerpiece ala Russel Allen. These two tracks compliment each other perfectly and when placed after Of Sins, the trio provides one of the best opening sequences of metal ever heard.<br />&quot;The Accolade&quot; - The opening of this track alone is worth the price of the album. It's a perfect blend of progressive and dark age folk music...something that has to be heard to know what I mean by that. The lyrics are particularly good on this track, though, as mentioned by others, the vocal is not pulled to the front enough....Russel has a great set of pipes and he should be up front in a &quot;ballad&quot; such as this.<br />&quot;Divine Wings of Tragedy&quot; - This, the title track, times in at over 20 minutes, and could have been released as an EP on its own. The numerous musical themes in this remind me of another progressive band, and despite its length, each section sounds like a new song so it's not so bad even for those less inclined to the progressive scene. <br />&quot;Candlelight Fantasia&quot; - The second &quot;ballad&quot;-like song on the album, this song reminds me a little of &quot;Beethoven's Last Night&quot; by Trans-Siberian Orchestra, though the music and singing are better here. At times Romeo sounds a little like Van Halen.<br />If this review helps to convince you of Symphony X's genius then I've done my job, if not--keep reading the other 5-star reviews until you are convinced and buy this album today!
B00018D44U|3.0|I liked many of the songs from her last collection but come<br />on there are so many gifted singers, musicians out there just<br />as talented as Norah Jones, waiting for a BIG BREAK. Its nice to see 1 million<br />fans running out to buy this, I'm really surprised that this<br />style of music is being embraced considering so much quality music out there is neglected due to &quot;ageism&quot; or what is considered &quot;oldies&quot; stuff by the younger power buying public<br />and radio programmers and the likes of MTV and VH1.  I don't see the younger generation beating down the doors to buy this one, especially after watching the Grammy Awards and seeing whats<br />now considered Hot Music, this tame stuff is so different its<br />almost hard to believe its on top of the charts. I guess I like<br />my music to not only say something to me, I need it to move<br />my feet as well, this music I can read to, fall a sleep to, but<br />not go out to see in a concert, sorry.  I agree she's very talented and smooth but It would be nice to mix some styles up,<br />especially the new collection, much of the same sounds and tempo?  They say shes<br />bluesy, I like my bluesy females the likes of Bonnie Raitt, Billie Holiday, Janis Joplin, Josh Stone (the 16 year blues/soul singer who deserves the same recognition),<br />Lucinda Willams and Aretha Franklin to name just a few talents that STRUGGLE to be heard these days on radio.  Way to much good<br />music out there to put a crown on Norah Jones stylings, its nice to have the power of her producer behind her?  I like the<br />way Dolly Parton forces Norah to pick up the pace, leave it to<br />Dolly.  This will be one of those recordings that will need<br />to be mixed with my other music to truly appreciate the gems<br />found here. Artists need some time and recordings under their<br />belt before their given this kind of treatment? Nice stuff, hope<br />it opens more doors for those just as talented but ignored.
0684803356|5.0|Having read two Hemmingway novels, I was not impressed.  Frankly, I was surprised that I did not enjoy them.  After growing up and hearing about the great Hemmingway, the man's man, I found his characters weak and whinny.  Ready to give up, I gave him one more try and I am glad he did. This is a magnificent novel. <br />Set in the Spanish Civil War during the 1930s it tells the story of Robert Jordan, an American volunteer fighting against Franco and his fascist allies. This is first-rate story telling, it grabs the reader from the offset and pulls him into the story.  Unlike other Hemmingway novels (i.e., The Son Also Rises), these are heroic characters that we deeply care about.  <br />The imagery is magnificent.  I can still see in my minds eye, the retreating Republicans, the panicked soldiers, the horses out of control and the cartridge casings spilled in the road way.  If you are unfamiliar with Hemmingway, read this book first.  All the others will pale in comparison.
B0000WN0ZK|5.0|In the scene where Vanessa Redgrave gives David Hemmings her fake phone number, a black thread appears along the bottom center edge for about 15 seconds.  No problem for me, but an earlier comment that it was flawless might consternate the obsessives out there (and you know who you are).
B00004YA66|5.0|OK, great movie with an original story. I still have two questions:<BR>1. After father and son change history and Dad identifys/shoots/chases away the killer, why is the killer never tracked down until the final struggle thirty years later?<BR>2. How did the father (as an older man) know to come to his son's rescue at the very end, and why wait so long? He should have moved his whole family knowing the killer was still out there.
B00005JME0|5.0|THIS is the movie upon whom's greatness all should be judged against.<br />At the very beginning, the \\"time gaps\\" lead you to believe that this movie doesn't make much sense (but this is just a brilliant insight into the character's own confusion).  Stick with it, and all will be clear by show's end.<br />This movie drives at the same notion that MEMENTO did...can you travel back in time (in this case through dreams) to fix your mistakes?  I don't know, but I sure wish I had always kept a journal...
0151008116|4.0|Here is an exceptional book that I read in a few sittings. It was always a pleasure to rejoin Pi on his seemingly impossible journey. It is slightly imbalanced, the story being very much in two halves, but I enjoyed both parts. My imagination was sparked continually by the clever use of language and the character of Pi's continuing amazement of the natural world. It's worth reading.
B0001BKAEY|1.0|Let this review target the common viewer who loved the original Matrix for what it was, a great action movie.  In my opinoin, although the second Matrix got a little complex, it at least delivered the incredible action scenes that we all craved.  From the highway scene to the Mr. Smith showdown, it was for lack of a better phrase, \\"action-packed.\\"  Personally, I was even pleased with the philosophical content that it carried over from the first Matrix.<br />Revolutions, however, is the read-headed step child of the Matrix trilogy.  From the time the movie begins to the end, you are asking yourself, \\"What in the hell is going on?\\"  Although the story fits with everything from the first two, it seems as if it was just thrown together.  Characters assume roles as if we are supposed to already know who they are, with no explanation or meaning even.  Fight scenes and scenes in the Matrix are limited, and all of a sudden the war becomes the main focus of the movie; who really cared about the war in Zion (like we haven't already seen enough futuristic war movies...against machines of all things)?<br />If you are thristing for more of Neo breaking the rules of the Matrix, watch the first two over again.  If you waste your time on this movie, you might find yourself asking, \\"Why did they ruin such a great trilogy?\\"  In my opinion the answer is that they forced the third one.  It seems to me that everything was slopily thrown together and shoved into the market for distribution.  I know that there are a lot of good reviews for this movie on Amazon, but let me say it once again: If you are the common viewer that enjoyed Matrix for it's mind-blowing action, then leave this one for the Star Trek and Dungeons and Dragons fans.
0060925000|5.0|The length, the size, the number of characters, the descriptions; Vikram Seth here succeeds in re-creating life of several characters into a highly acclaimed and engrossing novel. The story is simple, as is his narration, so the reading fast forwards through various people and several episodes that span nearly all human emotions. I would not discuss the characters here, for I would recommend just about everyone to commit himself to this book and see them for himself. The characters are people drawn from common lives, and he creates very vivid personas, describing in picturesque detail their houses, streets, odors, colors and both successes and failings. The sheer volume of labor that author must have put in to create this masterful  epic is mind boggling. The story is set in India, and for anyone who searches for words while describing his country and people, Vikram Seth sets a defining example.
B00008H2LB|5.0|Hello, I am your tipical rock fan. I lean towards more--old stuff, ie Led Zeppelin, Beatles, Rolling Stones, Pink Floyd, but I do enjoy an occasional dose of the newer stuff, ie Disturbed, Linkin Park, and some others.<BR>Lets look at all of these 1-Star reviews. Tisk, Tisk, Tisk. Nothing but bashing--for no damned reason, too. &quot;Stinkin Park!&quot; I've heard some yell. &quot;Anyone who picks up this album is obviously special&quot; others cry. And, of course &quot;LINCOLN PARK IS TEH SUCK!!!&quot; some of the idiots declare.<BR>This album, in my opinion, is a nice balance of hip-hop (I dare not call it rap [I don't like rap, much]) and rock. Each song is different, in one way or another, and that is a good thing.<BR>Enigma gives this album a 5---outta 5.
B00005JMCT|1.0|When compared to a train wreck I suppose this movie, &quot;American Wedding,&quot; the third in the American Pie trilogy, engages in a photo finish.  How to say that more succinctly and clear?  &quot;American Wedding&quot; is a cinematic disaster that should be avoided at all cost.  I suppose there may be a use for a movie like this.  After all the CIA still has Saddam Hussein and are surely interested in him telling all sorts of things.  Hussein could be forced into watching &quot;American Wedding,&quot; continuously looped until driven absolutely mad from being subjected to un-funny sight gags and tired forced American Pie I and II references until kicking and screaming he spills the Garbanzo beans.  Just the threat of having to watch the character Stifler in an annoyingly abrasive performance would be enough.<br />Half of the cast bailed from American Pie I and II and for good reason.  Chris Klien (Oz) and Shannon Elizabeth (Nadia) are most notably absent and surely happy about their career choices to sit this one out.  While the majority of the movie industry have moved past the &quot;let's see just how gross we can make the sight gags,&quot; the American Pie team has not.  So, we are left with jokes about consumed dog poop and body hair from certain regions of the body making it's way into the air conditioner and all over the wedding food.  Not much in American Wedding is funny.  Not much in American Wedding is worth watching.<br />So surely there must be something redeemable here.  Well die-hard fans of American Pie I and II may get a few yucks here and there and appreciate seeing Alyson Hannigan's &quot;Michelle&quot; character blossom beyond band camp.  And actually the soundtrack is quite good, but I can't recall the last time I or anyone else went to see a movie to listen to the soundtrack.  Save your money with American Wedding and skip the movie, go buy the soundtrack instead.<br />--MMW
B00005U2JL|4.0|What can I say, other than this made my day, I really liked the fact that this artist continues to reinvent himself while at the same time making sure to keep his early work as blistering, tight, fresh and hard hitting as it ever was. Say what you will about his creative path but when it's all said and done this band rocks the house like few others ever could. The only reason I give it a four and not a five is because well... I only reserve my fives for Mr. Trent Reznor... Ha!
B00008EY9G|4.0|I'll watch just about anything with John Cusack in it, and &quot;Identity,&quot; doesn't disappoint.  It turns out not so much as any single actor or actresses showcase, but fine spread around performances by all take the sidelines to the plot and the setting.<br />Director James Mangold, of &quot;Girl, Interrupted&quot; fame, does a fine job of setting the tone and mood with the scene.  It all has a neo-film noir nuance about it, with a neon-lit motel sign watching above a rainy and watery shadowed scene of a Bates-like Psycho lodging house from hell, where ten characters are trapped through loosely connected circumstances in an island of intrigue and mystery.  A perfect storm of weather and serendipity has left them stuck together trying to figure out who is doing it (murdering them off one by one) before their own numbers are up.  It is somehow tied into a convicted death row inmate up for consideration of a 24 hour prior reprieve, played creepily brilliant by Pruitt Taylor Vince.  The twist and turns that lead up to a horrifying ending will not disappoint.<br />Granted an experienced film and literary buff will probably be able to pick out familiar threads and elements of Agatha Christie, Psycho, and Sybil, but I'm not knocking the screenplay for revealing the inspiration for such an deliciously spooky murder mystery.<br />See for yourself.  Identify an edge of your seat thinking person's thriller in &quot;Identity.&quot;  I had to escort my wife around the dark recesses of our house after watching &quot;Identity,&quot; and boy what fun it was reeling from the lingering aftershock of entertaining fright.  Don't miss out on this flick.<br />--MMW
B00006879E|5.0|I was hooked the minute I heard Harder to Breathe, so I HAD to go out and get the CD. To my complete shock, none of the songs were like Harder to Breathe, but completely different, so much so I didn't know how to describe it to people. This is a MUST buy album, it's one that will be a classic and even possibly a trend setting album. You just gotta listen to the thing and trust me, you'll just friggin' love it! I'd rate the songs, but I love just about every single one on there, but the highlights are Harder to Breathe, Shiver, Tangled, and the very melodic and extremely smooth Through With You! GO BUY IT!
B00000JZC4|4.0|With Title of Record released 4 years after it's predecessor Short Bus (in 1995), some people were skeptical that Filter was dead. This, of course was hard to evaluate since the original Filter band was only composed of two men, Brian Liesegang and Richard Patrick. Since programmer Liesegang dropped out in 97, Patrick retained the group name for the next release.<br />In 1999, after a 4 year wait, Title of Record was released and it was without a doubt, a better effort. It sounds smoother, further industrialized, and the songwriting is improved. In other words, today's Filter is way better than the latter day Nine Inch Nails. This is ironic, since Richard Patrick was a guitarist for NIN's earlier work.<br />&quot;Title&quot; is clearly a driving record that never lets up. By late 1999, Korn's &quot;Issues&quot; and Marilyn Manson's &quot;Mechanical Animals&quot; were the only other monster albums out there. NIN offered the long-awaited &quot;The Fragile&quot;, which was a letdown for many since The Fragile's songwriting was less developed than &quot;Title of Record's&quot;.
B00006JIA4|4.0|When i first learned that this set is coming out, i was quite excited.  I feel that Queen, is one off the best rock groups of all time, but most people have only had the pleasure of listening to a few songs.  So if you are one of the people who have only listend to a few songs, this is the must have box set, you get to listen to most of Queen's best hits and the most memorable ones two! For the price, even if you haven't herd of Queen you don't have musch to loose.  And i can almost garantee you will love over 80% of the songs on the, three CD's.
068484267X|5.0|Angela's Ashes is a remarkable memoir in which the author, Frank McCourt, uses an abundance of literary devices to convey the dpressing story of his Irish Catholic childhood.  Through his themes, contrasts, and symbolism, McCourt creates a memoir that remains with the reader and teaches us all about the circumstances of life that he faced growing up in Limerick, Ireland.  The title of the book is derived from the ashes that fall from Angela's cigarettes and those in the fireplace that she stares at bleakly.  The entire setting of the narrative feels draped in ash-dark, decrepit, weak, and lifeless.  Angela's ashes also represent her crumbling hopes.  Her dreams of raising a healthy family with a supportive husband have withered and collapsed, leaving her only with cigarettes and the smoldering ashes of a fire for warmth.  <BR>In addition to the symbolism of Angela's ashes, McCourt also provides the River Shannon.  Frank's outlook on life matures during his childhood and adolescence.  Initially, the river symbolizes Limerick's bleakness and the brooding desolation of his childhood.  Frank associates the river with the endless rain that causes so much sickness.  However, when Frank grows older, he begins to see the river as a route out of Limerick.  As a result, it comes to  a symbolic escape, movement and freedom.  This is only one of the many literary devices employed by McCourt to strenghten his novel.  Also through the many day-to-day situations in McCourt's life, he provides the reader with an emotional outlook on the Irish culture, at least of those who were impoverished.  By setting up the entire narrative through literary devices, Frank McCourt has ultimately provided several layers to the story, which can be uncovered when the reader is ready and willing to contemplate the many meanings of his symbolic story.

B00009V8Z9|5.0|Chariot is one of my favorite CDs.  I heard &quot;Follow Through&quot; on Vh1 and I decided I had to have the CD.  &quot;Follow Through&quot; is amazing.  &quot;Chariot&quot; is one of my favorite songs.  Its piano is incredible.  &quot;Just Friends&quot; is also one of my favorites on the CD.  I also like &quot;I Don't Want to Be&quot; and &quot;More Than Anyone&quot;.  These are my favorites, but you cannot go wrong with this CD.  Everyone should own it.  I have let a lot of my friends listen to it.  Not many of them have heard of Gavin DeGraw, but they all love the CD after listening to just a few songs....get this CD, you will not be disappointed.
B0000797IO|4.0|I watched this movie borrowing a friend's DVD and at the close of it, I regretted not spending a pie on this touching movie.<br />One gets reminded of &quot;Full Monty&quot;,  &quot;What Eats Gilbert Grape&quot; and &quot;Blow Dry&quot; - three dissimilar movies which share certain common principles with this movie. The vulnerability of (lower?) middle class, the desperation in people endowed with limited choices and the moral dilemma they face with regard to decisions impacting family. <br />For those with an eye for subtlety and belief in myriad goodness of human emotions, this is a must-see. The morality of small time (self-made?) capitalist in Retail Rodeo owner, who cares for the health of his team and bereaves the dead; the unsung bond that willy-nilly develops between a couple regardless of fertility or masochism and many other nuances.<br />Stellar peformances by all actors. Isn't it really amazing that page one celebrities like Jenniffer Aniston, leading a life of zilion possibilities could portray such vulnerability and gullibility so convincingly ?! Wel, that's why they made to page one :-)
B000099T2L|2.0|Beyonce has a strong voice. She can really sing. I think her lyrics are so corny and silly and sexually dumb. <BR>A lot of the music on the cd sounds like remakes.<BR>She has too many people featured on the cd.<BR>I personally don't like Baby Boy even though Sean Paul is hot right now! But then again, maybe it's the Video.<BR>I don't know what she plans to do when she returns to her group DC because she has change her image completely with the Solo cd.<BR>I think she cross over too far with the sexual, Floetry is the only artist in my opinion who can write that way but keep it creative and tasteful.

B0000UJL96|4.0|This was definately the last great Trek of the original series, and perhaps the last great Star Trek adventure.  While I enjoyed the first 20 minutes of &quot;Generations&quot; and all the deleted scenes I have, esp the orbital skydiving scene, nothing can compare to the original series crew.<br />The menus were VERY annoying -that and the lack of a booklet cost it a star.  How many times do we need to see that cart go down the shaft??? <br />I did think the documentaries took a good chunk of time explaining the allegory to USSR / US, sometimes over-explaining the fact.  <br />I did enjoy the Shatner out-take - I just wish this film had more out-takes and or scenes. The problem with a near perfect film is the desire not to ruin it by adding things in that were left out. <br />As for the upside down ship on disc II, there is def. quality control issues - after the pains they went thru for Star Trek II, and TMP with Robert Wise, you'd think there'd be consistancy, but then again look at the titles, package coloring, etc they've all varied too.<br />My only hope is that Generations is of the same calibre as TMP or TWOK in terms of extras - many fans have the 12 or so scenes excised from Generations, and it would be helpful to have a more definitive mastered version of this. But Paramount being Paramount, it's not a 'given'.
B0000DJZ8R|5.0|It's almost too easy to label a movie a masterpiece today, but The Grapes of Wrath deserves that praise in spades. Not only is this film a masterpiece in scoop and visuals but a masterpiece in it's acting as well. I will say that this film is Henry Fonda best, and he holds your heart like no one does, and never lets go for an instant. Jane Darwell is simply perfect as her role as his mother, and her will and determination is the heart and soul of this movie. John Ford has made perhaps one of the greatest movies ever made, and made a timely massage about the faith of the human Sprit.
B00005U8EM|5.0|This is a terrific movie - hilarious, uplifting, and deeply romantic and heartwarming.<br />Bill Murray and Andie McDowell are perfect in this film, Murray as the cynical, infinitely self-centered TV weather newscaster, and Andie McDowell as his radiant and relentlessly uplifting TV producer and love interest.  The plot has been rehashed many times by others, so I won't repeat it again.<br />The thing that makes this movie so memorable, and makes it stand out from all others is not the comedy, which is enjoyable, but the deeper themes behind it.<br />What are these themes?  In reading the other 226 reviews, people have mentioned everything from Buddhist karma and reincarnation, Nietzsche and existentialism, Kubler Ross, the Seven Sins,  and Gurdjieff -Ouspensky and the Fourth Way.  Comparisons have been made to themes from the Twilight Zone, and Frank Capra movies like \\"It's a Wonderful Life\\".<br />Yes, I suppose all of these themes are present, and people will interpret this movie in the religious or philosophical context with which they are most familiar.  Which is why it's a bit surprising that so far nobody has mentioned the main theme that stood out immediately for me in this movie.<br />Above all the existentialism and New Age themes that might be found in this movie is a very old fashioned one -  at its core, this movie is a moral tale of love, hope, and redemption.<br />Bill Murray's character is stuck in time, stuck in purgatory, stuck in a perpetual rut of endless reincarnation and immortality, whatever you want to call it.  His character, Phil Connors asks, \\"What would you do if you were stuck in one place and every day was exactly the same, and nothing that you did mattered?\\"<br />Connors first uses his recursive immortality to dive even deeper into the Seven Sins, and then sinks into despair, hopelessness, and attempted suicide. But gradually, he awakens to the possibility that his choices of action do matter, and discovers that through caring for the other people in this town, he is able to regain hope in his own life again.  It is this genuine turn in becoming a better person that wins the heart of Andie McDowell's character and earns him redemption from this purgatory.<br />Another reviewer had mentioned a link to the theme of making hard choices in the \\"Lord of the Rings\\".  Thanks to \\"Groundhog Day\\",  I came to understand one question from LOTR that had always bothered me - why would any immortal being (i.e., elves like Arwen and Haldir in LOTR) ever give up their immortality?  The answer:  maybe immortality becomes tiresome and meaningless if one cannot make a difference in this world, maybe leaving immortality to gain the love of another is truly more worthwhile.<br />There was just one other aspect of this idea that came to mind - what if whoever or whatever had kept Phil Connors stuck in time had continued to keep him there even after his transformation?  We like to think that love and hope always leads to redemption.  What if it doesn't?  That's one real-life possibility which is not explored in this movie, but nevertheless, it is still a terrific movie.r the other people in this town, he is able to regain hope in his own life again.

B00018D44U|3.0|I bought the CD retail and brought it home, inserting it in my PC to play while I worked on the Mac.<br />Imagine my shock and anger when I discovered that by listening to this CD on my PC using Windows Media Player I had unwittingly installed Bandlink software on my hard-drive that was now collecting and attempting to communicate information on my music listening practices to Bandlink and other commercial entities via my internet connection.<br />I think that kind of software's called Spyware, isn't it?<br />When I e-mailed Bandlink to get the uninstall tool [it isn't provided with the Norah's CD that installed it], they tried to convince me that allowing them to collect information on what I listen to was in my own interest.  How George Orwell is that?<br />While Norah Jones continues to create and record enjoyable music apparently with great artistic integrity, both she and Bluenote should be ashamed of themselves for associating themselves with Spyware.
B000003NA4|4.0|Being next to her just as she sings... simply couldn't get better than that! As a jazz freak, it is nice to settle down and just enjoy little nicely composed tunes, in all sense just a great work! Very standard preserved jazz, well structured and entertaining, and Diana's piano skills just add more and more to the scene, not to mention her consonant beautiful voice that is always precisely adding more harmonic structure overall. The girl is talented, no doubt, but I recognize other than her virtuosity the fact that she sticks to her style, and she does it like few others, Sarah Vaughan  et al... Great music, just get it...
B0000214F0|4.0|I have read many reviews on this movie. Saying how sick and XXX-rated this title is. There's a lot of literature that clearly states how the empire of Rome fell due to their love of it's pleasures. Even the bible speaks of how depraved Rome was. So really if you're going to be sick of a movie that clearly states it's based on ancient Greece. Don't watch it!!! Yes there are a lot of sick parts in this film, but don't say this isn't a good movie. Everything in this movie is almost an exact portrayal of that time. There are many parts of this movie that's hard to sit through, but I have to admit the acting is superb.
B0000C3I6U|5.0|A lot of other people who reviewed this movie wrote about the &quot;psychological&quot; aspect of it and how Arnold was able to psych out Lou Ferrigno to win the 1975 Mr. Olympia title.  The fact is that most of what happens in the movie is acting, except for the training scenes and the actual contest outcome.  This is what I want to focus my review on.  Arnold retired from the sport of bodybuilding before I was born, so like many people my age the only way we could see Arnold training was through black and white photos in his Bodybuilding Encyclopedia book.  However, this DVD brings those pictures to life and now you can see Arnold training &quot;in motion&quot; for the first time (although it is less than 10 minutes of the movie).  Two scenes in particular that really give you an idea of how hard he used to train is when he does T Bar Rows and Squats.  Its unbelievable, the guy was a machine.  I have watched this movie so many times before I went to the gym and it is a great way to get motivated.  And as good as the movie is the extras are even better.  The interview with Arnold is very interesting and so are the behind the scenes footage.  The movie itself is very well done, Arnold has some hilarious quotes but the best thing about it are the training scenes.
B0000DZEA1|5.0|The Lord of the Rings: The Return of the King is soundtrack is so good, it's unbelievable! This soundtrack is the best one I've ever heard in my entire life! (With the exception of The Fellowship of the Ring &amp; The Two Towers!!)<BR>Howard Shore comes back better than ever...and, as they say, three time's the charm!<BR>Each track is beautifully performed, with guests such as the famous flutist and tin whistler Sir James Galway, Annie Lennox, Ben Del Maestro, and Renee Fleming. The soundtrack also captures the hauntingly beautiful voice of Billy Boyd (Pippin) and the deep quiet of Viggo Mortensen (Aragorn). <BR>My track recommandations:<BR>#5 - The Steward of Gondor (Very beautiful, feat. Billy Boyd)<BR>#11 - Shelob's Lair (Don't listen at night -- very scary!)<BR>#13 - The Fields of the Pelennor (Perfectly done, recounting themes from Isengard Unleashed {The Two Towers} as well)<BR>#15 - The Black Gate Opens (Awesome - feat. Sir James Galway!)<BR>#17 - The Return of the King (All 10 minutes are awesome!)<BR>#19 - Into the West (Who can resist Annie Lennox?!)
B00004Y635|5.0|In 1996, Wes Craven had directed the cleverly scary and hip, SCREAM. In 1997, Wes Craven returned to the director's chair to direct SCREAM 2. In 1999, Wes Craven had directed and welcomed us to the final act: SCREAM 3        In L.A., California, Cotton Weary (again played by Liev Schreiber) has returning to his L.A. home, where he has been shooting his Pilot episode to his talkshow entitled, 100% Cotton. He gets a call from a woman who claims to be his biggest fan. He asks for her name, making pleasant conversation, where the girl asks what his girlfriend do. Cotton asks how she knows about his girlfriend, where the Killer's voice takes over. Cotton's girlfriend, Christine Hamilton (played by Kelly Rutherford) lives with Cotton and is showering. The killer tells Cotton that he wants to know where Sidney is, but Cotton is smart enough to reveal that, but the killer hangs up after telling him that he will now kill Christine. Cotton rushes on home, as the killer appears. She locks herself in Cotton's in-house office. At that moment, Cotton's voice appears, but the killer is using a voicechanger that takes up your friends' voices. Cotton arrives at home, grabs a hotpoker and breaks into his office, where Christine hits him with golf club, but the killer appears and kills both Christine and Cotton. The killer is somehow linked to the latest film, STAB 3: Return To Woodsboro. STAB 2 was made after the events of Scream 2.        Sidney Prescott (again played by Neve Campbell) is safely hiding in a very secluded suburban area. Sidney is now working as a Women's Crisis Counselor. She, at the moment, does not know of Cotton's murder.         Gale Weathers, who is now an anchor woman for Total Entertainment, is offered, by Detective Mark Kincaid (played by Patrick Dempsey), to help the cops find the killer. At that moment, while Sidney is feeding her dog, the news reveals Cotton's murder. Sidney looks horrified, for she now knows that this is still far from over.        Onthe set of STAB 3, the producer of the all three STAB films, John Milton (played by Lance Henrikson), Roman Bridger (played by Scott Foley), who is STAB 3's director, and the movie exec are talking about how the murder was possibly influenced by the making of STAB 3, while four of STAB 3's cast members are on a replica of Stu Macher's house. The four castmembers are Tyson Fox (played by Deon Richmond), Sarah Darling (played by Jenny McCarthy), Tom Prinze (played by Matt Keeslar), & Angelina Tyler (played by Emily Mortimer). In STAB 3, Sarah will be playing Candy, Tyson will be playing Ricky, Tom will be playing Dewey, replacing David Schwimmer, who played Dewey in STAB & STAB 2, and Angelina will be playing Sidney, replacing Tori Spelling, who played Sidney in STAB & STAB 2. Gale arrives on set to get a good scoop on the set of STAB 3. There, she meets Jennifer Jolie (played by Parker Posey), who has played Gale in STAB & STAB 2, and will be playing Gale again in STAB 3. They have a little competitive arqument until Dewey (again played by David Arquette). Jennifer borrows Dewey's cell, while he talks to Gale. At that moment Gale and Dewey talk bitterly, where Gale is escorted out.         That night, Sidney has a nightmare, where she sees her mother's ghost, which turns into the killer's image. This ordeal is getting to her, seriously.        The next morning, Sarah Darling arrives at the studio to meet with Roman. He isn't there, so she decides to wait. He calls her and tells her that he is ten minutes away, but decides to run through the script with her while he is on his way. The read through Candy's murder sequence, where the STAB 3 killer says that his favorite name is Sarah. At that moment, Roman's voice turns into the killer's voice, where Sarah is killed.         Dewey and Gale head over to Jennifer's house. Gale, Dewey, and Jennifer find out that the killer is killing the celebrities in the order they die in the movie. The third person in STAB 3 that bitesthe dust is Gale. But, who amongst Gale and Jennifer will get killed? Luckily, there were three different versions to the script of Stab 3, so maybe Jennifer and Gale may have a chance of survival.         That night, Jennifer and Dewey are in Jennifer's house with Tom and Angelina. Gale arrives to tell Dewey that the director, Roman Bridger (played by Scott Foley), who was arrested for the murder of Sarah Darling, being that he was supposedly the one who called Sarah, was released due to the fact that Sarah's call did not come from Roman's, but from a cloned cell phone and was very untraceable. After the first two murders, the killer left a picture of Sidney's mother, Maureen Prescott. Dewey picks up the picture left at Sarah's death. He looks at it and notices that the buildings in the back of Maureen look unbelievably familiar. He picks up a picture of Jennifer dressed up as Gale and notices that she is standing in the same spot Maureen is standing in her picture. Maureen Prescott was in Hollywood over 25 years earlier. While Gale and Dewey are discussing what they found out, Jennifer's bodyguard, Steve Stone (played by Patrick Warbutton) is murdered.        Dewey and Gale return to the living room and discover that Jennifer, Angelina, and Tom are nowhere in sight. They suddenly come inside and find Stone's dead body at the front doorstep. Dewey and the rest run back inside and lock the door. Suddenly the power is cut and sends the crowd running outside. They suddenly get a fax. It's a re-write of the script. Only it's not the script to Stab 3. It's a script explaining who in the house is going to be murdered next. Who will it be? Gale? Dewey? Angelina? Jennifer? Tom? They run back outside, but Tom runs inside to find out what happens. The page reads, \\"The killer will grant mercy to whoever smells the gas\\". Unfortunately, Tom used a lighter to read the script. The combination of fire and gas blew Jennifer's house into nothing, killing off Tom. Dewey, Angelina, Gale, and Jennifer find yet another picture of Maureen. This time, on the back of it reads, I KILLED HER.         Sidney arrives in Hollywood. Dewey, happy to see her, asks her why she showed up because it is not safe for her. She showed because of the call she got from the killer. She says she's no more safe there than she is in Hollywood, but in Hollywood, she's not alone. Sidney notices the pictures of Maureen in Kincaid's office. Gale asks her if she was an actress because the pictures looked a lot like publicity stills. Sidney has no idea. At Sidney's request, Sidney, Gale, and Dewey go and see the places in the pictures where they run into Martha Meeks (played by Heather Matarazzo), Randy's sister. Martha has found a very useful videotape of Randy (played by Jamie Kennedy) that he made from the second film. It explains that the Sidney, Gale, and Dewey are not dealing with a continuing sequel. They are dealing with a sequel that is the concluding chapter of a trilogy and tells them how to stop this.        Gale goes off to find more info on this whole ordeal. Of course, the annoying Jennifer shows up at her side. The two head into the Archives building, where they meet Bianca Burnette (played by Carrie Fisher). Gale shows her the picture of Maureen Prescott and asks her for info. She tells them that they are look for Maureen Prescott and that they are not going to find anything about her. If they look for Rena Reynolds, they'll find more info. She hands them a file on Rena Reynolds. Rena Reynolds was the stage name Maureen was using while working as an actress in Hollywood. She starred in three horror movies: Amazombies, Space Psycho, and Creatures From The San Andreas Fall. The movies were produce by John Milton, the guy who has produced STAB, STAB 2, & STAB 3.        Sidney, is in the bathroom, where she meets Angelina. Angelina runs off to Stage 16. Sidney realizes that Angelina dropped her brush. She runs after her, hoping to find her and return her brush. She walks through the set that appears to be a house that looks all too familiar, but can't put her finger on it. She exits the house and finds the set looking like Woodsboro. In front of her is a replica of her house. The house she just walked through was Stu's. She enters her house, with memories of a conversation she had with Billy in the beginning of the first film. At the moment, Sidney is attacked again, for third time. Trying to bring her down mentally, the killer uses the voice of Sidney's mother. Dewey comes to her rescue and has her taken to the police station for safety. Dewey is then approached by Gale and Jennifer, where they him about Maureen's acting escapade. They head over to Milton's office and find out some things about Maureen that no one has ever known before. They head over to the police station to tell Kincaid and Sidney what they found out. But instead, they get a weird call from Sidney saying she's heading over to Milton's house, where Roman is having a party for his own 30th birthday.        There, all hell breaks loose when Tyson, Jennifer, and Angelina are murdered. Sidney is called by the killer, who has Gale and Dewey tied up. Sidney shows up to battle the next killer for the third and final time. Who is the killer this time? If you want to know, all you have to do is SCREAM one final time.
B00005JLR6|5.0|In America is such a great and moving movie that cried several times during the show. Samantha Morton and Paddy Considine give great performances as well as the little girls who play their daughters. _ Djimon Hounsou though is the scene-stealer in this film, and he deserves the Oscar nomination he got for his role. <br />If you are looking for a movie that will blow you away emotionally, this is it.

B0000A1RJI|4.0|First of all, let me say that I loved the Gladiator soundtrack before going to see Pirates in theatres.  Anyone who knows the Gladiator music immediately recognized it during the movie.  Now, of course, this has caused some to love the soundtrack and others to disdain it as a cheap cop-off of Gladiator.  At first, I really didn't like the soundtrack for the same reason.  <BR>However, then I considered the Gladiator soundtrack.  I believe it, like other Zimmer works, is heavily influenced by other composers.  Specifically, I am referring to Gustav Holst, a turn of the 20th century British composer.  In particular, Holst is known for his work entitled The Planets.  Mars, the first movement, is famous for its power and energy.  I believe if one listens to this track and then the Battle track from Gladiator, the listener will hear heavy similarities in tone structure and progression between the two.  Furthermore, I believe some of Zimmer's work in The Thin Red Line, in particular the track Light, may also be traced back a Holst work, Second Suite in F (Song Without Words).  <BR>Is there something wrong with these influences on music?  No.  These instances may be very much comparable to classical pieces of literature.  Chaucer's The Canterbury Tales is largely a retelling of Boccaccio's Decameron, yet it still has wonderful portions of originality and freshness.  Getting to the point, the Pirates soundtrack may be viewed in the same way.  Certainly, it is heavily influenced by Gladiator, but it also has a wonderfully original villain track and new perspective to the familiar Gladiator beat.    <BR>Furthermore, this piece has Zimmer's full blessing.  &quot;Score Overproduced&quot; by Zimmer is probably an understatement.  Badelt is certainly coming along, and for me, a Zimmer fan, it is delightful to see Zimmer training new composers.
B0001GOH6Q|5.0|Big Fish is the best movie I have ever seen and I have sent many, many people to see it and none have been disappointed. The easiest way to describe the movie would be \\"Terms of Endearment\\" for Sons and Fathers.  The son knows that his father is dying, but is unable to let go without at least trying to distinguish between his Father's \\"Fish\\" stories and his father's real life.  The viewer never knows until the very end of the movie where the truth lies in this senerio.  I assume many viewers will find themselves in this \\"non-chick\\" flick and so you may need some tissue, I did.  Also this is a Tim Burton masterpiece in production, visual effects, plot, music, and character interplay.<BR>The sexiest scene I have ever viewed in a film takes place in Big Fish and yet there is no nudity in the scene.  Jessica Lang provides the viewer with her usual superb performance and the young version of her character looks so much like her the viewer forgets they are two different actors and both their performances are outstanding.  McGregor, although has lots of scenes in the movie, plays his part of the confused and somewhat angry son flawlessly.  The father and his younger version keep the viewer so entertained that you never want this film to end.  I would recommend this film to everyone over the age of 12.  It is not a good choice for real young children because Tim Burton has done such an outstanding job of producing this film and most of the scenes are bigger than life and would easily scare younger audiances, although this is not a scary movie.  It is brilliant and I do not understand why Hollywood has not given this picture more oscar attention and it is rare that I ever want to view a film more than once I intend to buy this DVD and watch it 100 more times.

B00005K9LN|2.0|Most metal fans say that this is the Priest's best album, but I strongly disagree. This is a decent metal album, but in no means is this one of the best JP albums. After the brilliant proto-trash metal of Sad wings of destiny, Sin after Sin and Stained Class, Priest decided to make a 180 degree career shift with Hell bent for Leather. But this album, while being more hard rock than metal, still had high quality songwriting. This is not really the case with British Steel. The album open quite nicely with the simple but heavy &quot;Rapid Fire&quot;, with Rob Halford favoring a rough barking vocal style over his  banshee screaming of yore. This song is really catchy, but the complex metal of old priest is sorely missed. Then comes &quot;Metal Gods&quot;, another ultra-simplistic song driven by nice vocal line and hypnotizing guitar riffage. Once again, the childish simplicity of the song leaves you with an uneasy feeling but it's still an high quality song. &quot;Breakin the law&quot; is the best song of the album, with a nice riff, a nice drive and ultra catchy melodies. But you can't overlook the fact that this song is no more than a re-write of their song &quot;hell bent for leather&quot;. &quot;Grinder&quot; is the last good song of the album, once again with simpler-than-punk guitar work but the chorus is pretty memorable and the groove never let down. But all the remaining songs are worthless. &quot;United&quot; is a embarassing Queen rip-off, &quot;You don't have to be old to be wise&quot; is a pure AC/DC pastiche, &quot;Living after midnight&quot; is one of their most popular song but it is too hard-rock/almost hair metal for my tastes. &quot;The Rage&quot; manage to rock quite hard, until you realize with disgust that Priest stole Led Zeppelin's &quot;black dog&quot; riff note-for-note. &quot;Steeler&quot; is a filler re-write of &quot;Rapid Fire&quot;, with weaker riffs and a generic Halford melody. <BR>Only for the completist. I'd suggest Sad Wings of Destiny, Stained Class, Defenders of the faith as their best albums, with Screaming for vengeance, sin after sin and painkiller as good albums. The rest is not very good.

6305781427|4.0|I had seen this wonderful Yani work on VHS and remember the rich sound. While the performance in DVD format provides the eye candy you would expect I found the audio to be flat and the sound of the applause to be &quot;rain on a metal roof&quot;. Vocals had an annoying flatness and a strange echo - like the mixing was not done at the same level as the music. Seems the bass is nice during the music but disappears during the vocal spots. I think this is an awesome performance that belongs in everyone's library - just wish the entire audio was up to the video quality. I think his work that you find on CDs has spoiled this viewer - live recordings tend not to be of the same audio as studio work and certainly this live presentation had its own set of complexities to be sure. Buy it and enjoy it never-the-less.

B00005JMX4|4.0|I have finally seen it and I have to admit that while my expectations were low, I was surprised with how funny, smart and fast-paced this movie turned out to be. Yes, it might be a bit convoluted at times and have too many things going on, but the movie handles that incredibly well. You are entertained every step of the way, the movie doesn't feel slow or long at any point and it's downright hilarious.<br />I have to admit that the only reason why I wanted to see this movie was because of Emile Hirsch. I first saw Emile in The Emperor's Club and was amazed at how good he was in that film. He played the cocky troublesome kid with such ease that I was instantly reminded of another younger actor who acted in a similar fashion: River Phoenix. <br />I really believe that if River hadn't died, he would be one of the greatest actors around. But since that's not to be, then someone else should take that title and I am convinced that Emile Hirsch is the Next Best Thing. Let's hope he makes the right role choices and projects that will ultimately advance his career. Because he has incredible potential and it would be a waste if he doesn't take it seriously.<br />Aside from having such charisma and charm on screen, the kid can act. He's not just a pretty face. And in The Girl Next Door he plays Matthew, a straight-laced senior high schooler who is getting ready for college but needs a scholarship to attend Georgetown, his university of choice. He follows the rules, he studies hard, he never parties and his life is on the right path.<br />That is, until he meets Danielle, who is housesitting next door. She disrupts his life but in a good way. She forces him to take chances, to take risks, to skip school, to enjoy life to the fullest.<br />Now all of a sudden his life has been derailed. But it's all good until he discovers that she is a former porn star. He is upset and handles it badly. He makes attempts to win her back but is confronted by her manager, Kelly, who will have none of her quitting the business. Timothy Olyphant plays the manager in a casual manner, as if it's not hard to envision him doing this on a regular basis. I was a bit appalled to see he got porcelain veneers over his crooked teeth (which you can see in \\"Go\\"). They looked fake and much too big for his mouth. But anyway, Kelly is a scoundrel looking to make it big in the biz. And he considers Matthew very much an obstacle in achieving that goal.<br />Much hilarity ensues as Matthew attempts to win Danielle back, try to win the scholarship for college, try to fix all the messes Kelly has left behind. Amazingly enough, in the end, it all ties up very nicely. You are always cheering for Matthew and Danielle and enjoying yourself along the way.<br />I didn't expect to like Elisha Cuthbert in the role of Danielle. I had seen her before in the TV show \\"24\\" and I always considered her boring and vapid. But she was good here. Although I am not sure if I completely believe her to be the same age as Matthew as portrayed in the film, but that's neither here nor there. <br />I highly recommend this movie is you just want to see a smart comedy a la Risky Business/Ferris Bueller's Day Off (and no Matthew never speaks in the camera - Broderick was the only actor who could pull that off successfully and it should never be attempted again).

B0000DC13U|1.0|I have to admit, that both Gimme Shelter and the Rolling Stones Bridges to Babylon Tour Live in Concert '97-'98 DVD rate high for me. These two are classics that give us great performances by the Rolling Stones. Easy to follow, entertaining; and in the case of Gimme Shelter, thought provoking.<br />What happened here? I originally bought the VHS version back in 1994 during the Stones hype of Voodoo Lounge. I do not have the DVD version. I do not want it. This is perhaps one of the worst films out there.<br />Don't get me wrong. I love the Stones footage of rehearsing the song. I can even see that the director may have been trying an avant garde film (or avant garde a clue, as the late George Harrison once remarked). Just because this is the Stones or \\"avant garde\\", does not make it any better.<br />Disjointed scenes of interviewing one woman about love, the black revolutionaries scene, and other hodgepodge of stuff make this unwatchable. C'mon. Give me a break. If I am watching Stones I want performance, interviews, or insight from the band themselves. I would have given this movie 1/2 a star(if I could have on Amazon) for at least seeing the Stones in part of it. I always like to give the benefit of the doubt to any artist that I like.  In this case, avoid this \\"movie\\" at all costs.
B00005JMTQ|3.0|SOMETHING'S GOTTA GIVE is a lugubrious romantic comedy that at times doesn't know what to do with itself.<BR>     Harry (Jack Nicholson), a successful executive, is spending the weekend with his 30ish girlfriend (Amanda Peet) in the Hamptons. Erica (Diane Keaton), a playwright and the girlfriend's mother, comes to the house unexpectedly, meets Jack, and we're off. <BR>     The first section of the film feels like a manifesto, as the pros and cons of older men dating younger women is debated. When Harry has a heart attack and is forced to stay at Keaton's house things perk up a bit. The movie calms down and the two stars get a chance to shine. Keaton is very good as a woman coming back to life,and Nicholson, though asked to do less, has some good moments coming to grips with his age for the first time. The large cast also includes a loose Keanu Reeves as a doctor who falls for Erica and Frances McDormand,wry, as Erica's sister. <BR>     The last third of the movie is a bit of a ramble, writer/director Nancy Meyers can't tie it up as neatly as it should be. Throughout much of the film, the idea of older people being intimate is seen as weird, and indeed Nicholson and Keaton's sex scene is played very broadly. Still, they are both very appealing and transcend the material. Recommended for a date night rental.  (Keaton deserves the Oscar nom, by the way.)
B000050XEI|5.0|I've been a fan of Enya since I was little and therefore had to check this album out. This review is a little late, but definately needed. You will enjoy this album, it may be short, but you will love it.<br />Every song is just as beautiful as the last and they will each pull your heart strings; especially Only Time. Fans should enjoy it.<br />And yes, it needs extra tracks. The import version is worth your money. :)
B000003JA7|5.0|Like other reviewers I find the longevity of this record unmatched. The music moves with such skill and diversity, but most of all pure confidence. I have to listen to it at least twice whenever I put it on. Creativity was just wilder back then, and like the music, the LP cover is more entertaining than a dozen contemporary CDs. <br />As of today TAAB has 13 reviews, Dark Side of the Moon has 864. I am truly among the elite. To be fair, I guess Mike Oldfield is a far better comparison. Oldfield once made the best music of this kind - his first three albums. A great recent one-number prog-rock concept album would be Green Carnation's 'Light of Day, Day of Darkness'. So, find this album somwehere, and give it to your personal weird, pot-smoking buddy - positive results guaranteed.

B00006CXXU|1.0|unfortunately i find this album rather boring. what is interesting in someone belting out &quot;dirty ,naughty&quot; etc. her voice is more screaming/belting than singing and the songs are rather weak. One song even sounds like a weak copy of the Sugababes first hit &quot;Ovaload&quot; (UK No.1). Christina really didn't &quot;grow up&quot; with this album...maybe the next one will do.
B00006879E|5.0|this cd is simply amazing. i usually listen to either hip hop or rap but there something about maroon 5's sound that i just cant enough of. it mixes different genres into one amazing sound. buy this thing, no  joke.
B00005JM20|5.0|Johnny English is one of my favorite movies of all time.<BR>This Movie is hillarias.<BR>To compare this movie to any others I would have to say it would be down the line of, The Stupids, Top Secret,and the Master of Disguise.If you have seen those movies and you don't like that kind of humor this movie is not for you, even though this movie is better than all of those.<BR>Also you never know whats going to happen next.<BR>So if you like Stupid Humor this Movie is for you.
1401300901|2.0|I'd recommend this one only if you are somehow inexplicably stuck with NOTHING else to read. I had such high hopes for this buzz book but after the first 50 pages or so I found I had to force myself to pick it up each day and trudge as many pages as I could stand. Honestly, there are just so many other wonderful novels out there -- chick-lit or otherwise. You're not missing anything here.
0385504209|1.0|The Da Vinci Code is really two different books pushed together.  One of the books is awful and the other is unbelievable.  The awful part of the book is the thriller.  The main characters, like all main characters, are trying to uncover a mystery while be chased around by an appropriately bizarre killer (a super-strong albino Catholic fanatic).  This part relies on some of the oldest cliches in mystery/thriller writing, including the dying man leaving obscure clues as to who killed him instead of just writing the killer's name.  He supposedly doesn't do the latter because the killer might be watching him, but his behavior in leaving clues behind is so bizarre that if his killer was watching he would have to realize something was going on.<br />For a thriller to work, we need to care something about the characters.  That's impossible here because the main characters have no personalities.  One is a man and one a woman, but there doesn't seem to be the slightest thing interesting about them.  They are in no way distinctive human beings.  There are comic book characters with more depth than the ones you find here.<br />Thrillers of course turn on the characters trying to uncover some mystery, or acquire something that someone evil wants.  That gives the writer the excuse to have his characters being chased around, shot at etc. until the conclusion.  Alfred Hitchcock famously referred to the thing that is being fought over as a &quot;McGuffin.&quot;<br />Normally no one cares that much about the McGuffin.  Here, the McGuffin takes over the entire book.  The McGuffin here is the Holy Grail, which is very different than any would think who knows it only from Arthurian romances.  And it is Brown's explication of what the Holy Grail &quot;really&quot; is about that is driving the sales of the books.  Brown bases his theory on sources that have been known to be false for centuries.  However, it appeals to a certain segment of the population, and most people will uncriticly accept what he has to say.  For anyone with access to archives of the New York Times Book Review section, I suggest that they read the back of the Book Review for 2/22/04 for more on Brown's sources.<br />Normally I wouldn't care about what wacky McGuffin the characters in a thriller were chasing -- I like the X Files for years without ever believing in aliens -- but here it is Brown's statements about the Holy Grail that are responsible for the success of the book.  This success is not deserved.<br />I gave this book 1 star only because Amazon does not allow you to give a book no stars.y accept what he has to say.

B0000028M7|5.0|No one really talks about it much, but the 90's alternative explosion was rooted in heavy metal.  It was just covered up.  Nirvana claimed a punk tradition, citing The Meat Puppets, Sonic Youth, and The Pixies as influences.  Pearl Jam covered their dirty roots with big Who-ish guitars and poppy melodies.  The Smashing Pumpkins spent their time in the 80's new wave and goth areas.  But Alice in Chains was no-bones about their metal-ness, and in leiu of keeping up pretenses, they pummeled the music industry, their fans, and the radio with bottom-feeding guitars and an iron fist.  And in 1992, they went about making their follow-up to &quot;Facelift.&quot;  &quot;Dirt&quot; remains today their masterpiece and THE definitive early 90's rock/depression experience.<br />Drugs, self-loathing, death, and war are the biggies here and they don't try to cover any of it up.  There are no euphemisms, no suggestions in Layne Staley &amp; Jerry Cantrell's lyrics.  They lay it on the line in the same fashion as their heroes Metallica and Black Sabbath did before them.  The band had a sort of fear, yet obsession with death-- Layne screaming at the beginning of the album &quot;I believe them bones are me!!&quot; in horror.  Jerry pays tribute to his dead uncle, a war casualty in Vietnam, nicknamed &quot;Rooster&quot; by his squad.  The fear follows the band into the deepest depths of drug addiction  (&quot;Down in a Hole,&quot; &quot;Junkhead&quot;) through most of the album.  And the guitar, bass, and drums are just as desperate and pleading as the subjects they encase (Layne's apocalyptic harmonies on tunes like &quot;Sickman&quot; and &quot;Angry Chair&quot; are especially intreging).  The broading &quot;Rain When I Die&quot; has become all the more poignant with Staley gone (RIP Layne).  And finally, Alice in Chains give us a last minute gift; perhaps the greatest album closer in all of rock music... &quot;Would?&quot;<br />So many bands made such a fuss about hiding what theirmusic was; &quot;Seattle sound,&quot; &quot;Grunge,&quot; &quot;alternative rock,&quot; etc etc.  No one took the bull by the horns like AIC, and they are missed.  We must never forget our metal heritage.  Overall:  10 out of 10.
B00005JMQ0|4.0|Without a strong interest in history, everyone may not enjoy The Fog of War. While it's one of the most powerful documentaries I've seen, that is at least partially because it puts into context my place in world history in a novel way: I am a child of the first generation-- my parents' generation--- which almost annihilated itself completely, and our generation and those behind us now take it somewhat for granted that the capability of complete human extermination exists. Errol Morris, the director, and Robert S. McNamara share at least this goal: they do not want that power taken for granted.  <br />I even liked the wonderfully understated Philip Glass score, although I am not typically a Philip Glass fan. Whether the film would succeed simply as a black-and-white movie or would be as affecting, without the power of history behind it, is difficult to judge: it is rivetingly thought-provoking rather than entertaining. However, the accumulation of historical footage of events and public and private conversations of the powerful, both video and audio, is itself an astonishing achievement. Definitely I want to own this movie on DVD, as I will want to watch it several times to learn everything from it that it could convey--- certainly more than McNamara's succinctly titled \\"Eleven Lessons\\"--- , and something different could be learned from it if I watched it at three or four year intervals for the rest of my life. <BR> <BR>As film, it might be compared to \\"The Kid Stays in the Picture\\": a searingly honest, introspective account of a person's life. However, while Evans was an important filmmaker, McNamara made history, both before and after his stints in the Cabinets of Kennedy and Johnson, and world power was his milieu. McNamara's retrospection of his mistakes and the lessons learned from his life are profound, rather than merely fascinating. While Evans is an extraordinarily talented man, McNamara may be one of the most brilliant men of his era. That he makes this record at the age of eighty-five, and makes it not merely to be his self-exculpatory legacy, is staggering proof of his still-active mental prowess, and his willingness to process intelligence into wisdom. He doesn't make these shockingly honest revelations to convince us of his brilliance or his talent, but to let us also be boggled, as he is, by the concept that we human beings have the power to annihilate ourselves, our society, our species, and that some of us are stupidly willing to do so. <BR> <BR>He hopes that the lessons he learned will help us avoid the same mistakes in the future. He is not after credit, or assignment of blame, but after some honesty in the way we interpret what we think we know--- about him to a much lesser extent than about history. He does not ask for sympathy; in fact, he refuses to discuss some of the most personally painful aspects of his life. His mention of his and his wife's affliction with polio is almost off-hand. His grief over the death of JFK is all the more poignant because he is trying to hide it. He does not talk about putting himself in harm's way in VietNam, and explicitly avoids detailing  the personal threats menacing him and his family because of his position and the militant opposition to the war in VietNam. <br />McNamara does talk about service to his country, and the fact that he was poised to be an extremely wealthy man at the helm of Ford Motor Company when he accepted a government job--- a Cabinet position as Secretary of Defense under Kennedy-- that he was not entirely sure he was ready to accept. He is frank about those mistakes and misconceptions that he held earlier in his life which he now recognizes as mistakes, but clear-eyed when he talks about the fact that some of his actions would have resulted in his trial as a war criminal if he hadn't been on the winning side. He is not only brilliant, but much wiser, and very human. McNamara is a man who has learned the power of humanity's flaws, and this movie is his and Errol Morris's reverberant exposition of the flawed humanity of power. (A-)
B0000VCZKM|4.0|This is a very entertaining family friendly movie...for the most part.  There's a frightening chace scene where the villians are after Annie.  <br />There's one more thing--I think they went a bit overboard with Miss Hannigan's character.  Now, don't get me wrong--I'm a BIG fan of Carol Burnett and every time I watch her I laugh sooo hard.  But, I mean, that song \\"Little Girls\\" was a bit...brutal.  Not to mention that she is always in her underwear.  (Although, thankfully, very old-fashioned 30's underwear.)  I did like at the end how she tried to stop her brother from hurting Annie, so that mostly redeemed her character I think.<br />Overall, this is a very good movie.
B0000WN0ZK|5.0|Okay, here's the truth about this film.  If you are not into slow-plot movies, then you won't like this movie.  Sometimes while watching the movie you wonder whether there is a plot at all.  I had read the short story &quot;Blow-Up&quot; by Julio Cortazar which this movie is based on before watching the movie.  And I thought that the plot of the movie was minimized greatly to show quiet scenes.  All one really remembers of this film is watching this good looking guy (Hemmings) wrestle around on the floor with a couple of naked models, Hemmings developing pictures and looking at them over and over again until he realizes what he has been looking at all along (a dead body)..and a bunch of mimes in the end playing tennis with an imaginary balls.<br />Okay, so the first time you watch the movies it can be quite boring unless you are in the right mood.  But the second time I saw it it was on DVD instead of VHS and the pictures and scenes are so fun to look at that you finally realize what director Antonioni was creating...A pituresque film...The plots become more interesting...<br />But here's the next thing..You should watch this film alone...This is not a good date film....Because you may be in the mood to watch it...but she might not...All I know is that this is a film you really have to be in the mood for.  It can really make a date crumble...This should be seen with an sophisticated, intelligent person...<br />Julio Cortazar's story was mainly about a man who takes a picture and becomes obsessed with a woman he has photographed.  After examining the picture day in and day out he finally realizes he has been staring at her because she seems to be staring at something...And then he realizes that she is looking at something laying on the ground some distance away...A body...  Antonioni's film uses this plot in his film but expands on it with imagery and the story of this swinging 60s man.<br />Anyway, watch it, on DVD of course, cause it looks better, definitely worthowning if you like this kinda stuff.
B00006LLLN|5.0|I have never liked Bluegrass music but picked this up after hearing her voice in the movie Cold Mountain. This is a really good album. Her voice is lovely, but the MUSIC is the thing here! Whether it's her fiddle playing, or her bandmembers cutting loose or Dan Tyminski singing I can't find anything wrong with this album.I don't think it's made me a bluegrass convert but I've definitely become an Alison Krauss fan. There are very few singers that sound great &quot;live&quot; but Ms. Kraus is one of those and this is one album to buy if you enjoy good singing and GREAT music.
B00008WG3U|5.0|This albulm takes nofx's abstract political messages (like those in &quot;the decline&quot;) and uses them to attack the real political forces in this country.  Songs like &quot;franco-unamerican&quot;, and &quot;the idiots are taking over&quot; help to shed light on the crumbling relationships between americans and thier leaders, while songs such as &quot;she's nubs&quot; and &quot;mattersville&quot; deliver humor in only a way nofx can.  This albulm is a must have for any person who likes music in any way.
B00005JMJ4|4.0|Lost in Translation has a beautiful, dreamy feel to it. Loneliness and the universal search for identity feature as the major thematic focuses of the film.<BR>Two strangers who superficially appear to be very different (one being a older, fading actor and the other a young newlywed) share a common need for companionship and understanding. <BR>While I loved the majority of the film, much of the humor that centered around the culture shock each character experienced was misguided and too stereotype-driven to be genuinely funny - instead the jokes came off as ignorant and clich.

B000065U1N|2.0|From a technical and realistic point of view this movie is certainly very well done. The movie largely focuses on the realism of shootouts.  Unfortunately the enemy is depicted as -- as a previous reviewer had pointed out -- cardboard cut outs.  <br />In an almost documentary style... the movie recalls the 24 hour period in which the US military tries to capture the Somali warlord Aidoo.<br />Naturally, there will be comparisons to previous war movies.  This movie stays clear of the politics and the mythos behind war.<br />There appears to be 2 main purpose of this movie:<br />that 1. War is hell and 2. soldiers fight first primarily to protect and save eachother.<br />In my opinion it is NOT enough for a movie to be simply 'realistic' to illustrate point 1. (War is Hell).  Many movies made today can achieve this (Private Ryan, Schindler's List, Thin Red Line) through on screen gore.<br />Which brings us to point 2. --- this point is explicitly made by a 15 second conversation between two soliders.  I suppose Ridley Scott felt that the average viewer needed to be hit over the head with this message through this dialogue in case the 2 hours of depiction of soliders helping eachother didnt get the message through.<br />The trailers which preceeded this movie shows a scene involving a warlord (an Aidoo confidant) -- in a style reminicent of Kurtz in Apocalypse Now (played by Marlon Brando) -- suggesting a larger role and involvement of this character.  The reality is that this character very is 2 dimentional and is on screen very briefly and is infact a very VERY minor role...unlike the signifcance of the Brando Character.

If you want to get into the personal lives of mathematicians, their outlook on world, and the various intrigues in the mathematical circles, then this book will fill you in. If you're simply looking for a good story, look no further than _Fermat's Enigma_. It's great.
B00005JMJ4|5.0|I did not know what to expect when I finally saw this movie.  I had read so many rave reviews in the newspapers and watched critics say it was one of the best films of the year...I was convinced that I had to watch this movie.<br />When I finally started watching it I kept expecting something funny to happen, after all, Bill Murray is one of the funniest actors alive (Groundhog Day, King Pin), but it wasn't funny.  So immediately I said to myself, what a jip!  He won the golden Globe award for best actor in a Comedy?  But this isn't a comedy! I thought.<br />By this time I was bored and turned it off only 10 minutes into the movie.  But I was determined to watch it through so I played it again the next day and forced myself to sit through it.  What I ended up watching was one of the best films I have ever seen!<br />The story is not funny at all..It's actually sad...very depressing...But beautiful at the same time.  It's about this middle-aged actor (Bill Murray) and a young married woman (Scarlet Johansen) who are drawn to each other.  They are 2 Americans in Tokyo, and they movie shows them throughout the movie getting to know each other in this foreign place, and being alone in the world.  It might be, they both realize, that they may be each other's soulmates, but the fact that loneliness is not a calamity but fate for these two surpass their feelings.  This movie makes you cry at the end, and I seldom cry.<br />I still think that Bill Murray's best performance was in Groundhog Day, but I am very happy that he has been nominated for an Oscar for this film.  Usually these awards are not just for the sole movie they are nominated for, but for the body of their work...Take John Travolta when he won the Oscar for Pulp Fiction, for example!  I think Bill Murray should beat Sean Penn for best actor this year (2004).  I like Sean Penn a lot, (and I still think Sean Penn's best movie was Bad Boys-1982), but over all, Bill Murray was more effective in Lost in Translationthan Sean Penn in Mystic River.
B000002UAU|5.0|This is the most famous pop/rock album ever, and so many people wrote thousands and thousands of words about it. And it's hard to write something more.  I have to say I love this album although I don't consider it the best Beatles' product (this honour falls to 'Abbey Road' in my opinion). At the same time no one could ever deny its musical importance. Peak of Beatles' experimentation and psychedelic attitude, maybe even peak of Lennon/McCartney inspired songwriting (we have to wait two more years for Harrison's peak), I admit most of original ideas this album was based on sound rather dated today and we know the pop/rock music after 1967 didn't stay psychedelic and turned to roots-rock. I understand why someone might be disappointed at first listen and why more and more people consider other Beatles' effort as superior ('Revolver' and even 'Rubber Soul'). But I don't agree with them.  Personally I enjoy most of all 'With A Little Help From My Friends' (sung by Ringo, probably his best effort ever), the psychedelic 'Lucy In The Sky With Diamonds', the wonderful ballad 'She's Leaving Home', the amazing 'Being For The Benefit Of Mr Kite' (based on their first experiment with backwards tapes, cut and stitched) and the great 'A Day In The Life' (with the well-known crescendo of the orchestra). 'A Day In The Life' stands as one of my favourite songs ever. All the other songs are nice too in some way, although I was never so impressed by 'When I'm Sixty-Four' (and, partly, by 'Fixing A Hole', though I love the harpsicord rhythm section).  In the end this album was so full of innovations that it is easily one of the most important albums in pop/rock. It's not at all the most experimental or revolutionary album ever (I consider it 'innovative' but not 'revolutionary' from a musical point of view), but it made many people recognize pop music as a trend in modern art and influenced thousands of artists.  So if you don't own this album go and buy it. Don't miss a crucial element in pop/rock history in your music collection.
B0001AP12G|5.0|What more can I say that hasn't been said, the Kanye West is talented. His beats are UNTOUCHABLE!!!! Plus he spits hot lyrical content for the mind (&quot;We Don't Care&quot;), body (&quot;The New Workout Plan&quot;), and soul (&quot;Jesus Walks&quot;). Also he's representin Chicago, letting people from the East and West know Chitown has a city full of talent thats yet to be discovered. COP THAT DISC!!!!!
B00005JMJ4|4.0|So i heard that Sofia Coppola had a new movie comin out.. Immediately I my ears perked up... wasn't too keen on Bill Murray at first.. but hey..  I loved what she did with the Virgin Suicides, and the score especially..<br />Eventually saw the movie...wow..  a friend of mine said it was slow..so i went in with that expectation..  it's slow if you have a short attention span, or expect a car to explode every two minutes.. if that's you're thing this isn't for you.. <BR>nawh, I'm kidding about the attention span :-)<BR>it's not an action flick,though..  <br />someone said it was a boring film about two boring people, who double their boredom.. they were RIGHT.. a film about two real people being people, and done in such a lovely way.. It was funny, in a poignant way.. i don't see where the racism accusations come in..  anyhow.. it didn't feel contrived at any point, unlike some other movies(too many to list right now) <BR>Bill changed my original thoughts of him in the movie.. he was superb! the on-screen chemistry between the two is tangible, and i shall definetly be on the watch for her career.<br />bottom line.. great movie,with a great soundtrack..  Sofia has an eye (and an ear) for great cinema...  <br />it's a bit quirky at times ( due to the culture shock ) and a bit mundane ( the short snippets of conversation when they meet)  but highly enjoyable..<br />oh and i LOVE the 'style b' poster, with Scarlet Johansson in the<BR>Tokyo traffic, with the dinosaur scrolling across the building , and all the neon.<br />Sofia Coppola is one of my favourite directors;granted she only has two films, but I patiently await her next project, whatever that may be.
B00005V9QJ|4.0|...because Sade's concert was cancelled in Vancouver when Lovers Rock came out!  I was disappointed about that; but this CD makes up for it.  I bought the video version as well which is fantastic.  Sade seems like an old friend now, her music soothes me.
B000066NW0|5.0|Avril Lavigne is not a very likeable person but her music is awesome. The best track is #3, Sk8r Boi.
B000002J1O|5.0|In my opinion this is one of the best Prog-Rock products ever (I just cannot decide amongst this one, Jethro Tull's 'Aqualung' and King Crimson's 'In The Court Of The Crimson King'). And for sure it's the best Genesis album, the only one in Peter Gabriel's era with no filler at all, no boring passages and very consistent songwriting, the album that shows in the best way the particular and original approach of the band to Prog-Rock. <BR>My favourite tracks are 'Dancing With The Moonlit Knight', 'Firth Of Fifth' and 'The Battle Of Epping Forests'. The first one is a real masterpiece, with impressive Gabriel's vocals and lyrics and amazing instrumental breaks mostly based on synths and guitar. The second one is my favourite Prog-Rock tune ever. Someone finds it pompous (especially about lyrics) but for me it's the most impressive music I have ever heard, based on piano, flute, synth and guitar that contribute a wonderful wall of sound, cleverly alternating tension and sorrow. The third one is another wonderful epic tune, once again based on Gabriel's amazing interpretative skills. It's twelve minutes long but doesn't feature any boring passages.<BR>About the remaining songs: 'I Know What I Like (In Your Wardrobe)' is a very nice pop song with a catchy refrain and a complex and impressive structure; 'More Fool Me' is written and sung by Phil Collins and although it's just a sweet love song, it wonderfully fits into the overall mood of the record; 'After The Ordeal' is another very nice effort, recalling 'Firth Of Fifth' complex arrangement; 'The Cinema Show' is maybe the only weak tune, not so impressive especially when it starts, although instrumental final part of the song redeems the boredom of the beginning. 'Aisle Of Plenty', the album closer, reprises very wisely the main melody of the first song.<BR>In the end if you like Progressive-Rock you just cannot live without this album. An absolutely 5-star product for me.
B0001AP12G|5.0|I liked this album, the length helped it alot. Kanye has a slow mellow style of rapping ala: Mase and Fabulous, But his beats and lyrics are more methodical than the afore mentioned artists, not exactly bling bling good overall album.<br />Best Songs: <BR>School Spirit<BR>Never Let Me Down<BR>Through the Wire<BR>Jesus Walks

0385504209|4.0|Dan Brown clearly rankles some nerves in \\"The Da Vinci Code,\\" with his sweeping condemnation of the Church and its evil operatives. The pre-prologue, labeled \\"Fact:\\", may also cause some head-scratching among students of religious history. But I think the book can be best enjoyed by not taking it too seriously. After all, this is pop historical fiction, served up with intriguing plot twists, high-tech surveillance devices, charming little riddles, and a dash of sexual innuendo, all of which are played out by a cast of jet-set international cognoscenti.  James Bond meets the bible.<br />Chances are you've read, or are thinking about reading, \\"The Da Vinci Code\\" because, well, everyone else is reading it. Whatever formula delivers popularity, which begets further popularity, \\"The Da Vinci Code\\" certainly has it. And that could be the novel's strongest point.  It appeals to a wide audience and keeps readers captivated to the end.  That's the holy grail of this book.  It's easy to poke holes in \\"The Da Vinci Code,\\" but treat it as a fun read for the bus ride home and you'll probably be glad that you read it.
B000000OSG|4.0|Plenty of solid tracks on this one, still not as good as it's significant other. Locomotive is as good as any song off of the other Illusion. You could be mine and Civil War are great as well, but other then Knockin on heavens door, Pretty tied up and Get in the ring, they shouldn't have bothered making this album and just replace the weaker songs on the first album with all of these songs that I have favorably mentioned and 'Use your Illusion' would be an album that would stand next to Appetite for Destruction as another perfect album. I am aware that there already is a merged Illusion album, but it wasn't properly put together. I'm sure people would disagree with all this, and I don't care, that's their own opinion.
B00005OM4Q|5.0|I had heard from several different sources before I saw this movie that it was stupid and not to go see it, that it was just about some bands and their roadies....I say that is just total BS. This movie is increadible...it's not just about some band, it's about experiencing life, growing up, realizing who you are and axcepting it and what is stupid about that? Nothing, and on top it has some great actors that do a rather fantastic job of make the movie a GREAT movie.
0440237688|4.0|I really enjoyed reading The Giver. I thought that there were new twists to the story with every chapter. As Jonas goes through his training and journey to new discoveries we learn as he learns, about the community and beyond. I thought that every detail of the community life and the citizens was well thought out. I liked the fact that the society had a Utopian shell and corrupt internal workings. It showed that people go throw great lengths to take away all of the hurt and pain but it also takes away so many of the joys of life that can become complicated. I liked the deeper meaning and the overall picture that the story lays out. I would definitely recommend it to anyone!
B00006JDS4|1.0|I Spit on your Grave is first and foremost, an awful title for a film. The word \\"art\\" should never again be associated with this contrived and melodramatic film. The rape scenes are filmed from the rapists' point of view, and are FAR too long, in the sense that after 20 minutes, they lose their power, thus it becomes pornography. According to this sexploitation movie, revenge is a churchoing solution to violence. Something unforgivably dull about this movie is that there is NO soundtack. You would think they would learn that music is powerful after the harmonica scene, but unfortunately not. \\"I'm telling you (the town) it's too peaceful\\" is an example of the laughable dialouge that painfully ensues.<BR>  Save yourself the misery and instead buy the powerful, artistic rape film \\"Last House on the Left\\" which is great whatever you classify it as, horror, rape, revenge, or 70's darkness. But sadly, I Spit works on no levels, so don't waste you're money on it like I did.<BR>  Last Note- I Spit on Your Grave shows the rape victim get dirtier as she is sexually assaulted, and she is olny clean when she kills her assailents 'gloriously'. In Last House on the Left, it is the killers that become dirty and discusting after destroying their victim's innocence and lives.
B000001E29|5.0|This is Tom Waits's most original album by far. There are no regurgatated melodies from blues, jazz, and country like on previous efforts. Instead they are ripped of from romani folk music and circus tunes, however thats not meant as a criticism. These styles suit his voice quite well. It's not that his lyrics are better, or the presence of William B., it's the wonderfull back-up band he has this time around that makes this C.D. a must own. The orchestra is fabulous and the tunes are unique. Tom likes to experiment but too often experiment ends up meaning play very slowly with the intonation just a bit off. On this release he writes some great tunes that are fun even in an instrumental way. The music probably turned out so great because it was done for a play, which meant that Tom got slightly more ambitous with his orchestration and melody choices. Goot thing too as you are unlikely to ever hear a more oringinal Tom Waits album. 'November' in particular makes me cry everytime. Highly reccomended.
B0000009SE|5.0|As a synthesist, I realize I could probably count the number of people who will appreciate this review on one hand.  Nevertheless, all synthesists should hear Don Preston's great work on Waka/Jawaka.  I have been playing synthesizer for almost thirty years and consider Jan Hammer the best player of all time.  However, Don's solo here has got to be heard to be believed.  In thirty years, I have yet to hear a more expansive, boundless, breathtaking solo, and of course it is monophonic.  It is also played over what is arguably Aynsley Dunbar's greatest contribution to Zappa's catalog (Aynsley was one of Zappa's favorite drummers of all time largely because of the loose, creative style of polyrhythmic playing exemplified here).  Waka/Jawaka is a beautiful composition with classical development of multiple motifs, and features classic solos by Sal Marquez and Zappa.<br />While Big Swifty is avant garde electric jazz, the rest of the record is simply excellent rock/blues, with eccentric instrumentation such as electric bed springs.
0800187814|3.0|This is, without a doubt, an original, inventive and quite offbeat bio, which isn`t all that surprising given its subject matter. <br />Instead of a predictable, by-the-numbers approach, director Milos Forman actually manages to bring his main character to life, exposing his personality and making him a real love-or-loathe kind of person. Woody Harrelson is convincing as Larry Flynt, and the other actors manage to deliver excellent performances, too (Edward Norton as his lawyer and particularly Courtney Love as the messed-up Althea).<br />The story cleverly touches the polictically correcteness of the US, which ìs an interesting move, but in the process it also seems to glorify Flynt a bit too much. Still, for the most part, it suceeds in presenting all the controversy in an engaging, quirky and entertaining manner. The picture is also longer than it really needs, as the court scenes start becoming repetitive and tedious at parts. Yet, there are some memmorable moments to discover here (Althea`s declining situation is gut-wretching, and Courtney Love incorporates the character rather well in a beliavable performance that gets better as the plot unfolds). <br />All in all, not a masterpiece, just a fine accomplishment about a tricky and difficult subject matter. A serious, funny, moving and though-provoking cinematic experience.<BR>Recommended.
B0000CFW87|5.0|This CD is the best CD you will ever buy. I liked it so much I gave it to my friends for christmas. They love it too and are now fellow Grobanights. I have heard tons of CD's but this one is by far the best. This CD is truly in a class by its self.
B000002H2H|5.0|All he tracks on this CD are good... but the great ones are Ride the Lightning which is a good, fast song. Trapped Under Ice, Kirk has a solo after every verse. Fade To Black is the GREATEST song ever...buy the album and you will see.
B00005JMJ4|4.0|I enjoyed this movie for a number of reasons.  First, it is so wonderful to have a film about actual people moving through something approaching a real life on the road overseas.  If you've ever traveled on business in a different culture you will recognize how this actually feels and how it intensifies the stage of life in which the two main characters find themselves.<br />Isn't it wonderful that there are NO explosions, no 'action', no murders, mayhem, or monsters?  Just actual human characters with failings and emotions.<br />Bill Murray does so much with such complexity and subtlety that my appreciation for him has grown even deeper.  Just a superb job.  Scarlett Johansson is also quite special and memorable in this role.  There is a pair of scenes that epitomizes what these two pull off together (there are many more wonderful scenes than this example).  They are just before and just after Bill Murray is forced to open his door when he doesn't want to and Scarlett Johansson is on the other side wanting to ask him to lunch and he wants to go, but he can't just then and she understands why.  His embarrassment and disgust with himself and her disappointment, hurt, and let down is sad but a wonderful scene to behold.  They pull this off with a power that distills real life.<br />The film seems to work hard for its R rating.  The image over the opening title seemed unnecessary to me as well as the scene where he meets her briefly in a strip club and the drug references also seem tangential.  The core of the story doesn't hang on any of these things.  This is an adult film not because of the images, or sex, or drugs.  It is an adult film because of the deep, complex, and subtle emotions it evokes in dealing with the pain the protagonists lives and the friendship that flowers for them in their exotic setting.<br />It really is a touching and powerful film with some quite humorous moments.
B0000029GA|5.0|This album has the best lyricism ever! Many think that rap doesn't go any farther than 2pac and biggie but this album proves that although biggie &amp; 2pac may be better overall than Nas, this album is better than anything either released before or after their deaths. If you have had enough of all the 'bling' rap I advise you that this would be money well spent!
1400034779|3.0|I just read Alexander McCall Smith's novel and enjoyed it, but think it was best suited for high schoolers.  It was rather simplistic, and took many shots at Americans unjustly.<br />While Precious Ramotswe and Mr. Matekoni may be the kindest  Africans around, the crimes and behavior displayed by fellow Africans was not unlike those found anywhere else in the world. I liked both of their characters enough to read Tears of the Giraffe, again their kindness comes through.  No marriage yet.  I think the author plans to string us Americans along to sell books. He shouldn't bite the hands that feed him by slamming us. Even in the second book on at least four or five different occasions he takes shots at us when it isn't justified.<br />I guess I've had it with Mr. Smith.  He should show some &quot;kindness&quot; to his audience too.
0395389496|5.0|It must be nice to have written a real holiday classic.  I imagine that author Chris Van Allsburg must be tickled pink by way his book, \\"The Polar Express\\" has slowly gained increasing attention and praise as the years have gone by.  Though not my favorite Van Allsburg (a tip of the hat grants his miraculous \\"The Stranger\\" that honor) this book is perhaps more perfectly his style than any of his other texts.  And in that way, it is truly wondrous.<br />In this story, a young boy travels at night by a train bearing the book's title to the North Pole with a host of other antsy children.  This combines the dual pleasure kids would feel in getting to staying up late AND taking a train all by themselves.  Once at the North Pole, our hero asks Santa only for a silver bell from his reindeer's sleigh.  Santa complies and though the boy looses the bell on his way home, Santa returns it to him.  For years afterwards, only those who truly believe can hear the bell's magical ring (which, actually, explains why adults cannot hear Santa fly overhead at night, I suppose).<br />It's a lovely story, complimented nicely with Van Allsburg's realistic (but not photo-realistic) illustrations.  Particularly nice is how the story does not date.  Though it clearly takes place at a time when children wore dressing gowns, it does not feel as if it is a period piece.  The kids traveling on the train are slightly multi-cultural and the waiters on the train delightful in their white puffy hats.<br />This book is so well loved that it has actually inspired whole communities to create their own makeshift Polar Expresses.  On these trains, kids are served hot cocoa \\"as thick and rich as melted chocolate bars\\" while grown-ups read them the book.  They then meet Santa and go home contented and happy.  Unfortunately, as charming as this may seem, it may be greatly exploited with the late 2004 release of the CGI film version of the book.  My advice is to grab this book right now, regardless of whether it's Christmas or not, and read it to your kids thoroughly.  Such nice stories as this deserve extensive attention.  Let us all hope that this story sinks deeply into the canon of picture books beloved by millions of kids the wide world over.  It's a class act through and through.it's Christmas or not, and read it to your kids thoroughly.  Such nice stories as this deserve extensive attention.

B00005JH7D|1.0|I can not believe how many people liked this album. All the soloing is overdubed and uninspired. It is simply not jazz.
0451169514|5.0|This is an amazing book. This book made me realize that his &quot;bad guys&quot; in his book might actually be us. The reader begins to place themselves into the lives and minds of every character. Good or Bad. The plot is SO incredibly complex and detailed, and your head will be spinning halfway through the book. Don't let the size fool you. You won't be able to put it down, so this huge book becomes a &quot;weekend reader.&quot;The evil is so dark and the power of the said evil is depressing and Heavy. <br />This story is about a group of mis-fit kids that become an unbeatable force one summer in Derry, Maine. (Readers beware of Stephen Kings beloved Derry, Maine.) The way they meet, the people they are and the evil they must face, makes this the best horror book ever to occupy a bookstore shelf. All of the characters are lovable and so REAL that you feel everything they feel. It is truly amazing.<BR>I do NOT recommend this book for anyone under 17. It is VERY adult. Some of the ideas, themes and circumstances are not meant for young readers without the careful discusion and direction of an Adult. Proceed with caution.<BR>Also, my own word of warning to all. 'It' is real. When you read this book the room does not exist, but 'It' does, and you will be stalked by Derry (It) for a long time to come.
B00000AF98|4.0|OK, first off, let me point out that this was my first ever Kiss album so I'm somewhat partial to it. But in the years since I have come to be well aquainted with their entire catalog and you'd be surprised how well this one measures up. With the glaring exception of two tracks that should have been left off completely, \\"Crazy Nights\\" is a Kiss album that fitted in comfortably with the times. It could have benefited from a heavier mix and Gene Simmons sings four songs in much too high a key. He does not display his trademark growl ala \\"God of Thunder.\\" But the upside is he actually has a voice.<BR>  The album gets off to a roarin' start with \\"Crazy, Crazy Nights,\\" one of the best Kiss anthems marred only by an awkward intro. As far as I'm concerned, it ranks right up there with \\"Rock N Roll All Nite\\" and \\"Detroit Rock City.\\"<BR>  Up next is \\"I'll Fight Hell To Hold You,\\" a very dramatic song that is the 2nd or 3rd heaviest song on the CD. Paul Stanley lets his voice soar one this one.<BR>  But then we get to \\"Bang Bang You,\\" one the two worst songs in Kiss's history (Christine Sixteen being the other.) And possibly one of the worst in music. It's so unbelievably bad it's almost hip. It's hook is the kind that once you get it inside your head you'll go nuts. Avoid at all costs.<BR>  \\"No No No\\" is fairly bland, not well written. Gene sings it.<BR>  \\"Hell or High Water\\" is good, fairly heavy. Another Gene song. AC/DC has a song with the same name and although the two versions don't resemble each other, the Kiss version has shades of AC/DC.<BR>  \\"My Way\\" is the other song that doesn't belong here. This song sounds like it should have been recorded by Starship or Journey. It's very light.<BR>  \\"When Your Walls Come Down\\" rocks but sounds a bit stilted. There's no momentum.<BR>  \\"Reason To Live\\" is one of their best ballads. Slick, with keyboards(!) added. The video that aired on MTV was gorgeous and stayed number one on DialMTV for weeks.<BR>  \\"Good Girl Gone Bad\\" is terrific. Gene gets sleazy as only Gene can and sings this one in a lower key.<BR>  \\"Turn On the Night\\" is a great singalong even if the mix was a bit light. It's infectious and I listen to it often so I'll give it a pass.<BR>  Ending the album is the heaviest song on here, \\"Thief In the Night.\\" I've always felt that this number was completely overlooked. It could have been perfect if Gene had growled his way through like he usually does. The singing isn't bad but it could have been a Gene classic.<BR>  Overall \\"Crazy Nights\\" has more identity than \\"Asylum \\" does and their singles \\"Crazy, Crazy Nights,\\" \\"Reason To Live,\\" and \\"Turn on the Night\\" were very popular on MTV. They held their own against the Def Leppard juggernaut that was \\"Hysteria.\\" It has it's weak points (and one really atrocious song) but \\"Crazy Nights\\" is still Kiss done proud.
0805047905|4.0|For those cave dwellers amongst you who've finally crept out of your hermit-like existences to gain a little knowledge about the wide world of children's picture books, the name \\"Eric Carle\\" will be unknown to you.  For everyone else in the universe, however, Mr. Carle is undoubtedly one of the best known illustrators of the Western world.  The father of \\"The Very Hungry Caterpillar\\" and the more recent \\"Slowly Slowly Slowly Said the Sloth\\", his earlier work, \\"Brown Bear\\", is a sweet simple storyline that remains timeless.<br />In this story, different animal characters, cut cleverly from a dazzling array of colored papers, tell the viewer what it is that they see.  The cat sees a dog, the dog sees a sheep, the sheep sees a goldfish, etc.  Now when I said this story was timeless, I wasn't kidding.  Honestly, I'm having a great deal of difficulty finding ANYTHING about this story that's going to date it in one or two hundred years down the road.  Originally published in 1967, the book is particularly impressive because of the shot of children it cuts to towards the end.  Suddenly the viewer is observing kids of a myriad of races and skin tones.  In 1967.  And these are not your white-kids-painted-brown type pictures either.  And they're not all just black or white!  There's the most surprising thing of all, to my mind.  In an age when illustrators were having a devil of a time remembering to even include black kids in the occasional book, here we have a book that is including everything from Asian to Native American children, front and center.<br />On a completely unrelated side-note, the mother in this book bears a striking resemblance to a LOT of very hip mommies these days.  From her dark rimmed Harry Potteresque glasses to her well coiffed hair, this is a mother on the go.<br />To be perfectly blunt, I'm not an Eric Carle fan.  He bores me, and I have distinct memories of finding \\"The Hungry Caterpillar\\" annoying as a child.  But at the same time I'm having a lot of difficulty finding anything at all wrong with this book.  It's not the most exciting picture book on the market today.  It will not grab you, necessarily.  It doesn't demand the spotlight or find itself in intellectual discussions about the nature of animal representation for the pre-adolescent set.  It's just a good book with a nice plot and pretty pictures that teach kids about colors and animals.  And doggone it, that's good enough for me.lot of difficulty finding anything at all wrong with this book.  It's not the most exciting picture book on the market today.

B00013PHGS|5.0|AIR's best album since Moon Safari, don't get me wrong, Virgin Suicides Sdtrk was good, but this is the best &quot;album&quot; of original music from this fantastic duo in years. &quot;Run&quot; is a bit eerie and sweet at the same time, &quot;Surfing on a Rocket&quot; is a neo space age dream song of groovy proportions. Buy this and relax. The DVD is quite good also, only 5 tracks and nothing new, but its nice to see a band actually play their own instruments for a change.
B0000CABBW|5.0|I'm in the process of moving and packed up and shipped off all my DVDs.  Except for one.  I wanted to rewatch this- and it was even more moving the 2nd time around.<br /><br />Cinematography is wow.  The acting by all characters moving.  The writing, the storyline...I cried.  Niki Caro takes us through the emerging culture of the Maori, struggling to keep the old ways, as nearly every culture today does, yet in the midst of technological change, and the import of Western values.  And perhaps not all those values are bad... In no way is the culture of the Maori denigrated in this- rather the opposite, it is revealed in new ways to the outside world, as something valuable and worthy to be followed.  But it is also evolving, emerging, as is every culture, in every time.<br /><br />It is Keisha who makes this movie work most of all.  She is cute without being pretentious- she is honest and open in her acting, and so creates a character that desires goodness, and yet on terms of what is right for her soul, not necessarily what is dictated for her.  She is an Idealist NF dealing with an often absent Artisan SP father and a very strong Guardian SJ grandfather.  Her world is controlled by the Guardians, and she seeks to break free, and bring freedom, as an authentic Idealist.<br /><br />Benefits to the DVD:  Cut scenes were really great, especially the dinner scene, though I'm still trying to figure out why the scenes were cut.  And the section on some of the cultural background of the Maori people was very enlightening.
0385510438|1.0|I took this book on vacation expecting a great read and it turned out to be a boring tedious read.  If not for the Grisham name this book would not be on any best seller list.

0670451495|4.0|A tip of the hat, one and all, to Mr. Robert McCloskey.  The father of the delicately shaded picture book, his stories always contain simple plots and a bundle of warmth.  \\"Make Way For Ducklings\\" (which battles with \\"Blueberries For Sal\\" for the title Best-Known-McCloskey-Story) is one of the author's strongest efforts.  Bringing elements of rural and urban life together, it not only tells a great tale but remains timeless in its telling.<br />The story follows Mr. & Mrs. Mallard, a realistically portrayed duck couple.  No animals in funny clothes here.  The two settle on a small metropolitan island to lay their eggs.  Once hatched it's up to Mrs. Mallard and her troop to walk to their new home in the central park with the help of their local police force.<br />In the sixty some odd years since its publication, \\"Make Way For Ducklings\\" has remained exactly the same.  The closest it comes to dating itself (aside from the stately cars and \\"lending library\\") is that Mr. Mallard abandons his family to fly ahead to the save island.  That's one way of looking at it.  Another way is to point out that Mrs. Mallard is a capable mother who knows exactly how to lead her small brood.  The book is fun, diverting, and illustrated beautifully.  It does not pretend to be anything it isn't.  It is the classic above all other classics.  And it is McCloskey's greatest invention.
0316236535|5.0|I love this book, not only is it a fun book to read, but it helps children learn how to make the monsters go away when they are scared. I not only read this book to all my children at school but I also read it to my five month old son. He listens to me and the colors really catch his eyes.
B00000IMYA|5.0|This release is a miracle. Phil Schaap and Sony Music have done it again. When you take into account that no two tape machines play at precisely the same speed at any time and there was no timecode on the original,I continue to marvel at how well Schaap and his engineers at CBS Syncronized this. The sound is so clean it's as though this concert was recorded yesterday. You are put right in the front row! The Bass drums boom. The horns Blare. There are some flubs, miscues and so forth, but that's all right. There is a warmth and presence to this recording that blows the lid off most of the digital recordings I own. Hearing this release begs the question \\"Is digital really better than analog?\\" Put this on,relax and go back in time!
B00018D44U|5.0|This album has more of a folky feel to it than her previous album, but I like it even more. It's more upbeat, yet still relaxing. I listen to it every night as I'm falling asleep. It's very good background music for working as well, though I always find myself singing along.<br />Favorite tracks: Sunrise, Those Sweet Words, Be Here to Love Me, Toes

B00005RHGL|5.0|I rented this movie, then taped it off of tv, then bought the VHS, then bought a DVD player and this DVD and I would do it all again. First just let me say that I have shown this movie to six different people and they have all bought it. Many people may not like this because there are many scenes that seem inacurate, but many things in this movie that seem completaly ficticious, like Curly Bill shooting at Wyatt Earp three times and missing are acutally true, and things that seem real, like Virgil Earp and Morgan Earp being shot on the same night, are actually false (I forget the actual time frame, but there shootings were atleast 5 months apart). Despite these things, it was impossible for me not to love the movie and especially Val Kilmer's character (Doc Holiday). The movie \\"Wyatt Earp\\" (Kevin Costner) shows his whole life, and I am one of those people that get bored with most stories very fast. \\"Tombstone\\" spans just the short two years Wyatt Earp lived in Tombstone, Arizona, though the movie almost seems like the whole story takes place in only a few weeks. Anyway, this is a great movie (my favorite)and is filled with likable charactors, #1 ofcourse is the almost un-intentially comedic Doc Holiday. This DVD has some deleted scenes included that were not in the VHS or regular DVD, which do help to bridge the story, like what happens to Doc's mistriss Kate.
B0001AP12G|3.0|Hearing songs like get em high,jesus wlaks,and a few others before the album came out, i was anticipating an average mc with some production talent. AN album i could listen at interval points when i was temporarily sick of the classic hip hop records. Aside from the few songs i knew i liked, there were a couple that were also decent material. but i was disapointed in the end. Kanye had some prospect, but didn't follow through. Some songs are just boring, and as an mc, he is average,but at times less than par. The beats are for the most part good, as he is a good producer. Its better than most of the mainstream craap, but still not that great. The worst thing about this album are the insufferable amount of skits. some are seperate tracks so you can pass them,but others come at the beggining of songs,so you have to manually ff,or just sit through it every time. ANother thing is his constant slander of college. Now i respect everyones right to speak what they feel is their position, so i will let his postion on college stand-while i say my position. Kanye is insecure and has low self esteem about dropping out, and thus disses college in almost every skit. now that is fine, but his main point are that people with degrees end up as hobos or poor people with low paying jobs. In fact the opposite is true, people with degrees and schooling are the ones with HIGH paying jobs who dont have to resort to &quot;Drug dealing just to get by&quot;. this cd isnt worth the moeny,maybe if your friend owns it,burn it or borrow it for a couple weeks.
B000001ESN|5.0|Permanent Waves was a change in style for Rush. This was the album where they streamlined their sound while still continuing to compose the musically challenging epics that up to this point were their calling card. This album for Rush was equivalent to how Metallica's self-titled album was to them. But while Metallica's music would get noticeably weaker after they altered their sound, Rush would continue to make spectacular music for many years, not only with this album and their next release Moving Pictures, but also with more recent albums such as Counterparts and Test For Echo.<br />The high points of this album are the tracks &quot;The Spirit Of Radio&quot; and &quot;Freewill&quot;, two of their most enduring tracks, which still get solid airplay on classic rock radio. &quot;The Spirit Of Radio&quot; is the best of both worlds, it maintains the complexity of their previous works and is also one of their catchiest songs. Like their future signature track &quot;Tom Sawyer&quot;, you know the song immediately from its intro, in this case Alex Lifeson's memorable guitar riff. &quot;Freewill&quot; is one of their great radio-friendly rock tracks featuring excellent bass playing from Geddy Lee and a killer solo from Lifeson. Another standout track from this album, which the band has started playing again on their last couple of tours, is &quot;Natural Science.&quot; This is one of their best long tracks and sounds similar in style to what progressive metal bands like Dream Theater would do in the '90s. &quot;Entre Nous&quot; is one of their more overlooked tracks and features some of Neil Peart's more personal lyrics. The remaining tracks, the subdued &quot;Different Strings&quot; and the sci-fi epic &quot;Jacob's Ladder&quot; are also strong tracks. A more commercial album but by no means a sellout, Permanent Waves remains one of Rush's best musical statements.
B00018D44U|4.0|If you are a fan of Norah's first album, then you will also enjoy this album.  It is beautiful, warm music that soothes.  I agree that it does have a bit of a country influence, but I think it really works.  If you want more of this kind of music then I recommend you check out Rabbit Songs by Hem and Trouble Creek by The Damn Lovelys.
B000093BDX|5.0|I grew up on the Beach Boys and remember them appearing on Ed Sullivan when I was three years old. In those heady days, had anyone suggested that Brian Wilson was a genius, they would have been thrown into the nearest loonie bin. But now, his catalogue of work compares favorably to anyone else of that generations, excepting Dylan, the Stones and, of course, the incomparable Lennon and McCartney. Consider that Brian wrote, arranged and produced these 2 minute pop masterpieces. He also devised and invented the incredible harmonizing of the band. Yes, a real genius was Brian, this disc proves it.<br />This is by far the best one-disc compilation of the Beach Boys hits. It far eclipses the two-disc hits packages of 1975 and 1976, &quot;Endless Summer&quot; and &quot;Spirit of America.&quot; The songs are all remastered and many are in the original mono, which changes them slightly, but improves upon them. The package spans the period 1962-1985. My only regret is they didn't include their first minor hit, &quot;Surfin,' a rather inexplicable omission. But the rest of the songs are truly happy music. It's hard not to feel good about life when listening to the Beach Boys.
B00000ADG2|5.0|You know it's a good album when...it came out 6 years ago and it is still relevant today.  It is still moving, hip, rich in message, melody and harmony.  This CD took me back in the day and brought me back to the present day.  I see why Lauryn Hill got so much praise for this CD. Even though I like her raps, I love her singing much better.  Sister Act 2 showed the world the powerful voice she possesses.  The Miseducation of Lauryn Hill showed she knew what to do with it.
B00005U8EM|5.0|This movie was hillariously funny. It was about a TV reporter(Bill Murray) who relives ground hog day for six months. His mission is to make his producer  fall  in love with him. This is acomedy for the whole family to enjoy. Comedy at its best.
B000006TRV|5.0|Wow i think this is the best pink floyd album ever, and one of the best albums ever. One of the first concept albums.<br />The whole first side is just a great endless sequence. Best songs: In the Flesh?, Another Brick in the Wall Part 1, Another Brick in the Wall Part 2, Empty Spaces, Young Lust, One of My Turns, Another Brick in The Wall Part 3.<br />On the second side, the best songs are: Hey You, Is There Anybody Out There, Comfortably Numb, The Show Must Go On, In the Flesh, Run Like Hell, Waiting for the Worms, The Trial.<br />You really have to listen to the album the way it was meant to be heard-in one sequence-to get the feel for it.<br />!!!!BUY IT NOW!!!!
B00003CXPJ|4.0|Ben Stiller has been for quite a while now one of my favorite comedians, but I admit when this movie first came out in 2001, I didn't feel compelled to check it out. Time would prove me wrong. After seeing a few clips off of it recently, I decided to give it a shot, and how much I laughed!<br />To be honest, there were more than a few similarities to Austin Powers in &quot;Zoolander&quot;, but Stiller went beyond that. Taking on multiple roles, not just as an actor, but as Director, Producer, Writer, etc. Stiller proved on this one that he's up to the challenge, and makes you laugh 'til it hurts with his incarnation of a VERY dumb male model (Derek Zoolander) alongside a cast made up of close relatives (his wife, Christine Taylor, and his dad, Jerry Stiller, among them), multifaceted Will Ferrell and Stiller's now-inseparable comedy companion, Owen Wilson playing equally dumb male model Hansel McDonald, Zoolander's upcoming opponent.<br />Overall, more than a good renter: a funny movie for a good 2/3 of its duration. The end turned out to be a bit lamer than in most Stiller movies, but there are so many hilarious moments all throughout it, that I cannot give it less than four stars.
0385504209|1.0|As a matter of fact the only good thing about this book is that I got it free. Its ridiculous inaccurance and lack of cultural reference is overcome only by the predictability of the plot.<br />As a reader I would feel offended by somebody who would so badly mistreat my thinking capacity.<br />Two good examples:<br />Does Mr. Brown know  the correct spelling of the English name for Leonardo's famous portrait? It is MONNA ( double N) hardly rearranging into his poorly chosen AMON, on the other hand not without a hilarious effect since MONA ( single N) indicates the female genitals in the Venitian dialect<br />Does Mr. Brown actually considers that Emperor Constantine knew and spoke English so as to give the name of SUN - DAY to the seventh day of the week, honouring the abandoned cult of the sun, as he states in his novel? Amazing, since the name of that day in all latin languages is derived from Dies Dominicus, day of the lord ( domenica, dimanche, dominga) and even more amazing an English speaking Roman Emperor.<br />In my opinion Mr. Brown should do a lot more reading than writing, for histoy's sake.<br />maria russo
B00000294R|5.0|This album is simply amazing. One of the best lyricicts I have ever seen whose style was \\"thuggish\\" other than the late B.I.G. Its a tradegy that he died so soon and his talent could only be shown through two albums. Song by song he expresses such great verbiage and wordplay, its shocking. Everything works in this album, the lyrics, the beats, its one of the best ever. Let me try and give you some quotes:<br />\\"I got juice like boco, mad crews I broke through<BR>n*ggas be getting mad cause I hit more chicks than they spoke to\\"<br />\\"Battles I lose none I make crews run<BR>I get fools done, got ten fingers but only use one\\"<br />\\"I was taught wise, I'm known to extort guys<BR>This ain't Cali, it's Harlem n*gga we do walkbys\\"<br />\\"Cause on the shelf is where your LP cold stood<BR>Because it was no good, that sh*t ain't even go wood\\"<br />And there's plenty more where that came from. If your a fan of hip-hip in general and brilliant lyrics, then this cd is a must have.
B00005JKNF|3.0|If you're looking for something witty and exciting like &quot;Clue&quot; then this movie is not for you.  It shows the subtle relationships between the serving class and those that they serve all in the context of a murder mystery.  This movie is more like a novel, with the details that most directors would leave out of a movie because they aren't &quot;action packed.&quot;  I found it to be entertaining and full of wonderful detail.
0312995423|5.0|Characterization in Dan Brown's Digital Fortress<BR> Characterization can fall into two different categories, indirect and direct.  Dan Brown's use of indirect characterization in Digital Fortress has strengthened it almost exponentially.<BR> Susan Fletcher, the protagonist in this novel, is a somewhat mysterious character in the beginning of the storyline.  But as the story moves further along, the reader is able to gather quite a few things that they normally would not have discovered.  Because of this employment of indirect characterization, Brown is able to let on what Susan wants, and what she fears, but in a manner that is more, shall we say, secretive, than direct characterization.  Brown utilizes this literary device very effectively.  He is able to let the reader learn things about Susan as the plot progresses.  Things that sometimes not even she knows.  When things are written in this manner, they keep the reader in more a guessing state of mind, one that makes them interpret the scene differently than they would have normally.<BR> Brown uses indirect characterization to keep his readers guessing.  He allows for very open interpretation of his novel, which leads to a very interesting sub development in the sub plot.  It is because of these reasons that Dan Brown's Digital Fortress gets a plus for being strengthened by the use of indirect characterization.
B00008BRB5|5.0|Synchronicity has all of the ingredients I love in Sting's music: great tunes, insightful lyrics, great harmonies and infectious rhythms. The Police are at their finest on this album.<br />Every track is a gem and the album has great variety: there is a lot more to it than Every Breath You Take and Wrapped Around Your Finger.<br />This is one of the best albums by any artist. Highly recommended.
B00005JLXE|1.0|Maybe not the worst ever, but definitely close. How they could have such a huge budget for this film and accept such a horrible story is beyond me.<br />I've been a pretty big comic book fan for 20 years. While I never got into Daredevil too much, he made numerous guest appearances in my favorite comics, and I was looking forward to this film. Yes, it's a comic book movie, but the level of camp in this film was unreal. There must have been hundreds of cheesy lines in almost every line of dialog during this film, you'd almost think Arnold Schwarzenegger wrote the screenplay. Add to that the ridiculous amount of blind jokes and it was painful to sit through. Okay, Daredevil is blind, and yet has insanely high perception in his other senses, we get it. No need to show endless shots of him doing amazing things with his other senses to hammer this into our skulls. Bullseye has perfect aim and can hit anything he wants to, we get it, no need to show 20 scenes of him using this skill either.<br />This film takes \\"ridiculousness\\" to a new level. Daredevil is human. Unlike Spider-Man, he has no genetic mutations. He simply has heightened senses from being blind. The story never proclaims he has anything other than human abilities either. However, there are literally hundreds of stunts that Daredevil does that are humanly impossible, I don't care how great he can here, there is no way he can jump 50 feet in the air, or vault off a 50 story building and land on a fire escape and not break his legs. This guy could give Spider-Man a run for his money for all the advantages they gave him.<br />By letting Daredevil achieve insane stunts, it creates no sense of weakness for him. You are never left feeling like there is a battle this guy can't win, which is a mistake in film making. Daredevil can scale a 20 foot wall, yet he gets stabbed in the shoulder and that knocks him out for half the film? He can't summon the energy to help out Elektra, his love, yet right after that he can make his way a couple miles across town and get involved in the fight of his life?! This film is FILLED with inconsistencies, mistakes, and just absurd events that would require a complete suspension of belief reality in order to enjoy this film. I expect comic book movies to take some license, but this film makes \\"Armageddon\\" look like it was taken straight from the film vaults at NASA. And with all of this absurdity, there is no way to enjoy this film as a campy popcorn movie. I would consider \\"Tomb-Raider\\" a masterpiece in comparison.<br />Perhaps the biggest flaw with this film is the CGI. For a recent movie, this is some of the worst CGI effects I have ever seen. None of it looked realistic. I can't think of a single special effect that I would believe. Remember that scene in Spider Man where Toby Maguire gets his new powers and starts jumping 50 feet in the air from roof to roof? Imagine an entire movie of that. They may as well have left the blue screens and wires in. At least Mark Steven Johnson admits on his commentary that the CGI is crap.<br />Did I mention that Bullseye (with a horrible performance by Colin Farrell) actually cuts someone's throat with a playing card in this film and kills a man by throwing a paper-clip into his neck?!<br />That being said, if you like this film, the DVD is loaded with bonus features. The audio and video come across very well, and the featurettes are fairly well done. This DVD has everything you could want if you're a fan of the film.make his way a couple miles across town and get involved in the fight of his life?!

B0000A5A0T|5.0|For me, the recordings Coltrane made between 1957 and 1959 were his greatest of his entire two decade career. Milestones, Kind of Blue and Blue Train all showcase Coltrane at his best. Unlike the two recordings he made with the Miles Davis Sextet, this music is more easy listening and for that reason offers the perfect introduction to John Coltrane. Coltrane plays with fire on a wonderfully exciting blues journey, Blue Train; his solo being perfectly complemented by an equally exciting solo by trumpeter Lee Morgan. This piece is one of the most famous of all Coltrane recordings and rightly so. The recording captures the freedom and ambience of a true jam session sound. My personal favourite, however, is the only cover track on the album, I'm Old Fashioned. Here, Coltrane showcases, what for me, is the highlight on any John Coltrane solo - his sound. Coltrane had one of the most sublime saxophone sounds in the history of jazz, for me, second only to Charlie Parker. On this track, Coltrane bares his sound for all to hear, free of the intense technical displays which tend to obscure it. Like many other Coltrane ballad interpretations, he plays the pure melody, with slight augmentations, but always with simplicity and honesty. John Coltrane truly had one the most individual and beautiful sounds of all time and it is truly exemplified on, this, his most accessible of all recordings.
0780622553|5.0|This is a near-great movie, with fantastic production values and decent acting.  What keeps it from being among the truly greats is its somewhat trite mind-control storyline. The consensus rating of 4.5 stars is about right; l gave it five because Amazon does not allow half-star ratings.<br />&quot;Dark City&quot; would make a great double-feature with &quot;The Truman Show,&quot; also released in 1998.  Both movies deal with manipulated realities, and Dark City's Shell Beach, which John Murdoch is so eager to find, is a dead ringer for the idealized town that Truman Burbank is trying to escape from!<br />PS: Amazon's listing for &quot;Dark City&quot; notes that people who bought it also bought 12 Monkeys, Donnie Darko and Blade Runner.  I am one of those people (I own all three, although I didn't buy them from Amazon) and &quot;Dark City&quot; is definitely in the same general quadrant!
B000000Y2R|4.0|I first heard this recording when I was sixteen. It was one the few recordings I heard of Charlie Parker and Dizzy Gillespie playing together. While nothing can top the original recordings they made together back in 1945, this recording is by far second best, when compared to the final recording of Gillespie and Parker made for Verve towards the end of Parker's life. With the inclusion of Thelonious Monk, that album featured three of the bebop originators. The Quintet at Massy Hall, however, features all five of the original and greatest names in bebop - Charles Mingus, Max Roach, Bud Powell and Parker and Gillespie. Unlike the Verve date, the playing on this album, particuarly on the fast numbers, is far more cohesive and less brittle. Gillespie is still rather brittle on this recording, but Parker sounds smooth and quite haunting in the higher register. This is his true sound, not the anguished cries of his later years when he was deteriorating physically and mentally. Gillespie is technically inventive and as always is entertaining to listen to. Powell ebbs and flows, playing angular but smooth phrases that are rather like a cross between Monk and McCoy Tyner. Mingus and Roach are also standouts. I have never had the opportunity of hearing any live recordings of Parker and Gillespie from the mid forties in New York, when Parker was at his peak, in my opinion. This is about as close as one could get and it really is the last great Parker/Gillespie masterpiece.
B000002V0Q|4.0|Perhaps Megadeth does not get the credit that they earned through their career, especially for their best album, &quot;Countdown to Extinction&quot;. On this disc, their guitars are the heaviest, and Dave Mustaine had grown into his peak as a songwriter. His lyrics are much better on this album than their previous efforts, and definitely better than the things that were to come for Megadeth. <br />This album seems to be forgotten because of the massive downward slide this band took after this disc, and the end of the band was producing nothing more than far below average metal. They lost their edge in the end, so we tend to forget that they were really good at one point. Also, Megadeth has always been overshadowed my Metallica, and rightfully so. For every good album that Megadeth put out, Metallica put out a better one. For those who might remember, &quot;Countdown...&quot; made its Billboard debut at #2, shortly before the Black Album began its incredible run at #1. <br />Comparisons aside, this is a good thrash album, and it does deserve to be remembered for its venomous potency and great guitar riffing.
B000000Y2R|4.0|I first heard this recording when I was sixteen. It was one the few recordings I heard of Charlie Parker and Dizzy Gillespie playing together. While nothing can top the original recordings they made together back in 1945, this recording would come about third, when compared to the Carnegie Hall concert of 1947 and the final recording of Gillespie and Parker made for Verve towards the end of Parker's life.

The only other live recording made of Charlie Parker and Dizzy Gillespie in a concert environment is Diz 'n Bird at Carnegie Hall, which is stunning. However there are only several pieces and the personnel is not nearly as representative of bebop greatness as this album. This is about as close as one could get and it really is the last great Parker/Gillespie masterpiece.
0790729652|5.0|Too many people have forgotten about the Batman movie franchise because of what Joel Shumacher did to the last two movies by making light and fluffy flicks with a cavalcade of cheesy villains. But the original &quot;Batman&quot;, directed by the brilliant Tim Burton, is by far the best comic book movie ever made. It is dark, the way it should be (note to Shumacher and anyone else who makes a Batman movie), and the plot is limited to one villain in the Joker. Jack Nicholson plays the Joker, in what I believe is the best performance in his career. Michael Keaton also shows he is the best Batman of them all, his calm and broodingness appropriate for the Dark Knight.<br />Burton directs this movie perfectly, bringing in his patented cartoonish look, making Gotham the perfect combination of 'toon and nightmare. His wild imagination could not be better on this movie, as he must have had thousands of ideas to bring the classic comic to life.<br />There is not much more to say about &quot;Batman&quot;, as the movie speaks for itself. It was a monster hit in 1989, and has entered the annals of being a classic since. I hope that WB puts out an anniversary edition this year, since it has been 15 years since its release. For those who like the idea of a comic book going to film, this is the movie to watch. Aside from that, it is a great dark story about vengeance and classic good versus evil. An excellent movie all around.
B0000DD7LB|5.0|I like this CD and recommend it for anyone above 14yrs and interested in good pop music with a flavour of hiphop<BR>I read one-star reviews by the same people. Some dud keeps on and on about how good Karen Carpenter was and gave her whole biography here instead of commenting on Britney's album. It is really sad how people who haven't even listned to the CD come here to write reviews. Because if you have listened to the CD, there must be something in here that you'll like unless you're a rock fan. <BR>This CD is filled with fun music. And the lyrics are not about all the crap someone mentioned below this review. They're fun lyrics and this is a party CD. I advise you to buy it.
B00004YRQA|4.0|Sony produces 1 GB smaller memory sticks, this big card has only 8MB (which really sucks, because most of the games take over 1MB).. also it is kinda slow (well, slower than expected)<BR>What's so good about it is its reliability (the classic PS1 memory card gets erased when its not used for a long time, this one doesn't (yet!)) , and the price is very fair
044022165X|5.0|This is truly a fantastic book. I dont want to go thru the plot, coz to tell you the truth, this book is less abt a plot, its about humourous narative power unleased by Mr grisham, that will keep you in splits throughtout. Some may think me to be nuts, but really the court room thriller is just a canvas on which I think Mr Grisham wanted to try his hand at humour. And it comes of beautifully.<br />you dont want to read this book,<br />* If you dont like first person perpective in present tense.<BR>* If you want 50 % dialogues which get you through big fat fiction books in one evening.(This book is purely narrative power, only abt 10 % in dailogue).<BR>*If you dont like books where there is no shift in perspective. This book is completely through the eyes and ears of Rudy Baylor the main protagonist page 1 to page last.<BR>*You are looking for big conspiracies and huge climatic endings like the firm.<BR>*You really dont have a sense of humour and infact hate laughing,smirking,smiling,giggling while reading.(I did all of these while reading) <br />For everyone else this book is a joy<br />Humour highlights<br />*The mulch planting section with Miss Birdie. <BR>*The U section in the courtroom (this is the cream)<BR>*Rudy's odd shaped colleague, Deck always waiting for tragedies and disasters so they can make some money representing them for insurance claims. I coud not believe this, lawyers actually waiting in hospital cafeterials wishing and hoiping for bandaged and mummied up patients to be taken up as cleints. The better the car accident the more the claim.<BR>*Dont miss this ..The stupid letter as the bomb in the courtroom scene.<BR>*The pretentious Mr Drummond episodes from the &quot;Trent and Brent&quot; firm with his collection of 4 other pretentious souls like him who all the time keep scribbling on their legal pads god knows what and bill at obscene hourly rates.<br />Lots lots more.. just read it<br />PS:Also dont read this in crowded places..people will takeyou for some dumb guy who keeps breaking into sudden smiles and chuckles.
B0000AQVCL|5.0|What we really need in this music industry is a band who can make you wanna get up and rock out.  Not a lot of bands these days do that.  Their all about looking hot and cool.  Not Jet.  They have awesome music and aren't concerned with appearences.  They are more focused on their music.  I think Jet is an awesome band!!! Go Jet!!!  Ally06

B00004Z459|5.0|I really don't know why everyone is bashing Linkin Park. Sure, their music doesn't really fall into rock or hip hop (even though it belongs more in the former category), but nonetheless, it's still pretty good. When I first bought this CD a couple of years ago, I mainly wanted it just for \\"One Step Closer.\\" However, as I started to listen to the other songs on Hybrid Theory, I realized that these guys actually have some talent. Most of the songs are pretty good; the only one that seemed to bother me was \\"Cure for the Itch.\\" I wasn't really sure what they were trying to do with that song. Overall, not a bad CD, considering this is their debut album.
6304711905|3.0|Tombstone is about the Immortal Wyatt Earp and his brothers in a town called Tombstone where they came to make a new living but took up the side of the law again to fight evil cowboys. There are running horses, saloonfights and a lot of gunbattles, so nothing new there. And a little romance of course. Even the titles in the end scene are western like<br />What makes this movie stand out a little about the others is the acting performance of Val Kilmer as Doc Holliday. His accent is perfect and he plays a dying man very convincingly. This is the only reason you should really see it.

0780625129|5.0|In one word this movie is indeed \\"POWERFUL\\" American History X is a movie unlike any other I've ever seen. <br />Edward Norton (The Score, Fight Club) is brilliant and Oscar worthy as Derek Vinyard, a bright young man who is at the breaking point and falls victim to the trap of racism by listening to the lies and propaganda of white supremist leader Cameron (Stacy Keach). Derek's younge brother Danny (Ed Furlong) destined to follow in his older brothers footsteps must learn the wrongs of his older brother so he doesn't repeat them. Perhaps the only one who can reach Danny is his brother Derek.<br />If you've never seen it American History X will shock you to say the least. It contains Extremely brutal violence, extremely harsh language and subject matter, wouldn't recommend it to younger viewers. If your looking for a \\"POWERFUL, SHOCKING\\" movie with superb acting than check out American History X! Well worth a look!
B00005VWK3|5.0|I wish there were 10 stars.<br />Having stood the test of time, it was first published in the 30's, this book teaches you all that is there to figure drawing.<br />Andrew Loomis is one of those rare, gifted artists who can articulate as clearly and truthfully using words as he could with lines.<br />Using very simple tools to define the structure of the human body, essentially the skeleton as the foundation, he teaches how fantastically easy it is to draw the human body from any angle, in any action, and of any type.<br />This is not one of those 'feel good' books that teaches you to do 'yet another thing'. This is a grand text. absolutely dedicated work, you can see the earnestness in Loomis' anxious words about getting across the details to the reader.<br />Kimon's 'Natural Way to Draw' is a classic in a different way, where he asks us to discover almost everything. Loomis gives us the crutches. I think a combination of these two approaches can be terrific. thats what I am finding out.<br />It has been very fullfilling , since I can pick up the artifacts of drawing the figure, and infact drawing anything for that matter, Loomis will lead you to explore and expand, the techniques are amazingly simple, yet absolutely powerful.<br />He reiterates to see the structure beneath anything, the skeleton, and how it aids us in construction.<br />Note: the book is out of print, but several online versions are scattered across the Net.
0446530891|4.0|As a fan of David Baldacci, I really looked forward to this book, Split Second. The author kept me interested with great characters and intrigue. The relationships between the characters are well-developed, and I found my self caring for them. I especially appreciate not having to wade through tawdry sex scenes and an abundance of foul language. Although the believability of the plot falls apart about 3/4 of the way through the book, I hung in there for the characters. The ending sets up the possibility of a sequel - I certainly hope so for these great characters. And maybe the ending will be plausible.
0385508417|4.0|What a wonderful idea to skip Christmas, away from all the hassle of sending x'mas cards, preparing for parties, getting the house decorated, buying gifts and receiving gifts that probably are useless... However I guess Luther should have picked an earlier date, rather than christmas day itself!<br />Of the preparations that Luther and Nara took for the trip - going on diet and going for tan, I was anticipating what would have happened in the end.  It was quite a twist, that add to the an element of excitement and hence the pace of reading.<br />I was particularly touched by the ending.  A kind gesture of Luther, but I guess as an accountant, he did just the right move than to have his three grand wasted.  (What a timely x'mas gift~!)
B0000VCZKM|5.0|I cannot believe such a horrid review was made (editorial review)! Obviously this person was not a little girl growing up in the 80s. I did not have a chance to see the play as a girl. I will tell you, this was my ALL time favorite as a child. I watched it every day. I now have a baby girl of my own, and cannot wait to share the joys of this movie with her. I think I can even remember the words to sing along!!
0804102988|1.0|I have to admit that I haven't finished the book (yet) but at page 836, I think I've read enough to say that this is a horrible book. I can't comprehend how anyone would voluntarily read it AND even more amazingly, read it to the end. This is the book used for torture in my British Lit class, and I can honestly say that the ratio of people that actually enjoy the book to people that are already making plans to burn it once the year is over, is about 1 to 200.<br />Admittedly, I'm not a history buff, and perhaps those are the only people that can enjoy such a book. But to my thinking, anyone that interested in history must already know it very well, so all the boring passages trying to cram decades of history in while the actual characters and plot sit by and wait, would seem superfluous. <br />If anything could save this book, it would be captivating characters and a gripping plot. Unfortunately, Sarum has neither of these. The characters are hackneyed, lacking depth and anything to interest the reader. No character lasts longer than a chapter. The flood of names and half-developed personalities don't stop throughout the book. So many characters share the same one-dimensional personality with their ancestors in preceding chapters, that it just seems like the author got tired of trying to invent new characters. <br />The main fault with this book is that it invariably bores all but the most dedicated of readers. Anyone looking for a book that mixes accurate history with engaging stories and vivid characters had better look elsewhere. Even all the unnecessary sex scenes are not enough to rouse the interest of my fellow students, which is saying a lot. <br />I would not recommend this book to anyone, and would even go to great lengths to prevent anyone from subjecting themselves through the hellish nightmare of reading this book. There are better books out there; don't waste your time or money on this one.
0812550706|5.0|It is an interesting occurance that nearly everyone who reads this book finds something different in it. Some find it a scathing indictment of the industrial-military complex, others see it as a tribute to the bravery of the soldier. Some find a Christian parable, others see Ender as a humanistic massiah. <br />One thing is certain, however, this is the seminal novel for current and former GATE students. You know those kids who in Middle School were sent to special classes to take advanced classes but ended up just being pushed to do extra busy work. This book seems specailly poignant to them.<br />Anyway, this is an excellent sci-fi novel. Don't be deceived by the seemingly simple story of alien invasion, there are many levels of depth.
0783225792|3.0|This is where it all happen for the great Martin Scorsese. His take on the origin of Las Vegas is not only a step back for the director but a bad reflection on Robert Deniro himself. He is good in this movie but he is saddle with a over acting Sharon Stone ( which is good but she goes a bit too far), and a tepid Joe Pesci. The movie is a bit too long for its own good, and needed to shave the minuts down.<br />I don't know what went wrong with this great director because the next films after are almost as bad as this film turn out to be.
B00018D44U|1.0|The music is not bad, not too different from her previous album. The CD contains stuff to mess up your computer if you listen to it there. It is like a telemarketer that calls when you are having candlelight dinner with your date. I would not recommend buying it because of this problem. Norah should fire her managers.
0385504209|5.0|THIS BOOK WAS SO VERY WELL WRITTEN. I PICKED IT UP ON A SUNDAY AND FINISHED IT ON A WEDNESDAY. I COULD NOT PUT IT DOWN. I WANTED THE STORY TO GO ON AND ON....NEED MORE ABOUT LANGDON AND SOPHI PLEASE!!!!!
B00005JLKN|3.0|Before Hannibal ... Before Silence of the Lambs ... There was evil in its purest form ...<br />That is the tag line Universal Pictures is using to lure in fans of Hannibal the Cannibal into the latest feature film. Though younger fans of the Hannibal Lecter series may be amazed at the originality of Red Dragon, the older fans may believe that the story for the highly anticipated sequel is all too familiar. And they would be right. Red Dragon is actually a remake of the first Hannibal Lecter film, Manhunter, which was released to little public acknowledgement back in 1986. In Manhunter, Dr. Hannibal Lecter was played by Brian Cox. Now veteran actor Anthony Hopkins returns to the role that made he made famous in Silence of the Lambs. But returning to a famous role can have its downs as well as its ups, just look at Hannibal. Granted the highly anticipated sequel had a huge opening weekend (the largest opening weekend for an R-rated film until The Matrix Reloaded opened) but due to lackluster reviews and some public panning, the film dropped quickly from the public eye. Will Red Dragon be doomed to suffer the same fate as its predecessor or will it be able to bring the series back to its former glory?<br />The story takes place several years after Dr. Hannibal Lecter is captured by FBI agent Will Graham in a bloody confrontation that leaves both with permanent scars from the event Though Graham has left the FBI because of the capture of Lecter, he is still sought out by Agent Crawford who needs help in a special case. It is believed Will possesses an ability to get into the mind of the criminal and capture them quickly. After searching through evidence of the disturbing murders of two families, Will admits that had help in his cases. That help came from Dr. Hannibal Lecter, who is now in jail serving nine consecutive life sentences. Now Will must face his greatest fear of confronting Lecter again. If he doesn't, more and more people will die at the hands of this serialmad man. The story of Red Dragon is pretty well done compared to Hannibal. It sets up a good opener of how Lecter was captured but the injures sustained by Lecter in that confrontation are not fully explained in the course of the film, which causes some confusion as they seem to focus more the injuries of Will Graham then Lecter. Other then that small squabble, the story envelops the audience and really brings them into a suspense thriller that is well played.<br />The cast for Red Dragon is pretty large and offers a variety of talented actors and actresses from many different backgrounds. Anthony Hopkins once again offers a stirring performance as Hannibal the Cannibal. He presents a character that is not only intelligent but one that will leave chills down your back long after the movie is over. He plays him so well that it seems that he was destined to play Dr. Hannibal Lecter. Edward Norton gives a good performance as Will Graham. His character isn't cared for as much as Clarice in the previous Lecter films but then again, the audience isn't as attached to him as they are Clarice, emotionally that is. Ralph Fiennes presents a quite but twisted look to a serial killer. He plays the role straight out as a man who knows what he is doing is things that are wrong but has no emotional control over himself. Other characters within the film are played as they should be and do not stand out amongst the earlier mentioned cast but still are pretty good overall.<br />Overall, Red Dragon was a good film but not a fantastic film. The story played well with its two hour time frame but there several moments that offset the generally good film. There were parts in the plot like the ending to the confrontation between Lecter and Graham in the opening sequence and whole ending to the film that caused confusion and really let down fans of the series. The ending to this film could have been taken to a whole new level but the filmmakers stuck with one that was sort of expected. Notto say that everything in the film was bad. The story played out for the most part except for the previously mentions plot holes. The acting from Hopkins, Norton and Fiennes really set this film from the rest of the trash that is currently cluttering the box office theaters. Plus the way Red Dragon transitions itself into Silence of the Lambs film by introducing Clarice but not showing her was very well done by the film makers. But all those good things can't take away the feeling the audience was a little cheated with the ending. This is a good film to see opposed to trash like Knockaround Guys and The Tuxedo which may or may not be getting more attention then films like this.
B00001MXXH|5.0|A timeless classic.  Smart, funny, clean... a movie that teenagers can watch with their parents without feeling uncomfortable, and vice versa (unlike other teen movies, like Fast Times at Ridgemont High - another classic - and the American Pie series that have explicit sexual situations). No matter how many times you see it, it's still just as funny as the first time.  This is a definite must have in your DVD collection.
B00005JLSE|4.0|The Walt Disney Company and Storyline Entertainment have had a very successful relationship together reviving old musicals which they hope to continue with Chicago. In 1997, they revived Rodgers &amp; Hammerstein's Cinderella which aired on The Wonderful World of Disney on ABC and became a ratings success. Both companies were willing to see if lightening strikes twice so a revival of the old favorite Annie was created for ABC in 1999 and followed in the footsteps of Cinderella. Now that Storyline Entertainment has proven to be a worthy investment, the real test was to revive the musicals for the big screen. The musical has greatly lost its luster since the golden days of the 1930's. The highest grossing musical since 1975 was Grease, which opened in 1978, and the most successful musical in recent memory would have to be 2001's Moulin Rouge with a $57 million take. With that in mind, will Storyline Entertainment find success once again with their film adaptation of the Broadway favorite Chicago or will this be their first failure?<br />The story of Chicago focuses on the lovely Roxie Hart who has huge dreams about becoming a star like her idol Velma Kelly. She is willing to do anything to obtain that dream which includes cheating on her husband with a guy who claims to have connection in the business. One night Roxie finds out the truth about her secret lover and taking the gun from her dresser, she shoots him once and then shoots him again. After her husband spills the beans, she is taken to jail where she learns that one can still become famous with the right angle and the right lawyer. That lawyer is the flashy Billy Flinn, who has never lost a case with a woman client. Roxie soon enters a new world of deception and greed as she competes with the famous Velma Kelly for the razzle, dazzle lawyer. Who will come out on top in Chicago? The storyline for Chicago is fabulously well done. The musicals sequence strive from the imagination of Roxie Hart which allows the musical to be a musical without the song and dance sequences come off as tacky. Most musicals start out a song with the usual one liner with dancers coming out singing moments later. Chicago thankfully doesn't do that and it works. <br />The cast of Chicago is truly an Oscar worthy cast. The most fabulous thing about the cast was that each actor and actress did his or her own singing. They may not all hit the right note but the feeling that you get from the film is very gratifying. The biggest surprise from the bunch is Richard Gere who plays the flashy lawyer, Billy Flinn. He really shines in numbers like Razzle Dazzle and All I Care About. Cathrine-Zeta Jones, who is actually a Broadway veteran, really shows off her stuff with great style especially in the opening sequence of the film. Renee Zellweger is good but not great as the central character Roxie Hart. There could have been someone better then Zellweger to the play this role but she still does a decent job. She definitely has the right look for the role but it was her dancing and singing in the musical that were the big disappointments. John C. Reilly does such a fantastic job especially n the Mister Cellophane number that there is no need mentioning anything else. Queen Latifah was a delightful surprise as Mama Morton. The remainder of the cast does a wonderful job at providing the perfect amount of background characters that you would expect from the Chicago backdrop. <br />Overall, the film adaptation of Chicago was as good or better then all the buzz suggested the film would be. The songs are amazingly well done with best being Razzle Dazzle, Mister Cellophane, and the Cell Block Tango. The numbers were quite surprising and didn't come off tacky as originally thought. Most of the cast seems to work well except for two. And was said before, Renee Zellweger is good but not great as the central character, Roxie Hart. There certainly could have been a better to take the role but Zellweger works fine, just notoutstanding. The other member who didn't work well was Lucy Liu. It wasn't her but her character that was the problem. Her slight appearance in the film seemed kind of pointless though she does help play out the rest of the story just a bit. They could have done a lot more with her character but it is no real loss. The comeback of the movie musical may have been started by Moulin Rouge but Chicago continues the surge with full force. Chicago is one of the best movie musicals in recent memories and one the best films this year. Make it your priority to see this wonderfully delightful film.
0393307050|5.0|Reader after reader will pick this book up only to throw it down, head swimming. It is obscure, obtuse, arcane, and absolutely wonderful! Throughout the Aubrey/Maturin books, O'Brian places his fictional characters into factual battles, trying to not pepper the actual history with fictional outcome. With the lead protagonist based loosely on Lord Cochrane, an infamous character in his own right. The result is a studded prose style, closer to the actual prose of the time, rather than writing with a pseudo~arcane style as viewed through the late 20th century prism of many writers. If you can finally fall into the book's rhythm, you'll have to deal with the lexicon of the 18th century sailor which itself seems a daunting task. Most of the sea terms are not needed to follow the story so don't get hung up, or let the obscurity &quot;cross your hawse&quot;. <BR>Literature is read to for one to grow, and in that sense this book is literature. Very few writers send me running to the dictionary... O'Brian can do it with a three-letter word (fug).<BR>If you want a rollicking good and easy read go with Hornblower (yes the C.S. in my name is an homage to Cecil Scott Forester), but if your up to the challenge of growing as a reader and being immersed in the culture of the day, then do what it takes to get through this book. Once you find O'Brian's cadence (or WHICH cadence of the many he seems to use) the books get much easier. The plot and sub-text become clearer, and in the end this is an intense 20 volume &quot;buddy&quot; novel with much of the plot being the interactions of two diametrically opposed friends.<br />PostScript: It took me two times to get through it too!
6300214435|4.0|After a film as critically and publicly praised as Raiders of the Lost Ark was, how does one make a follow up to it? That was the question on the minds of creators Steven Spielberg and George Lucas, who, during the time leading up to and during Raider's success at the box office, continued to make names for themselves in Hollywood. In that time, Steven Spielberg directed quite possibly one of the most memorable films in his career, E. T. Extra-Terrestrial, while producer George Lucas wrapped up his highly successful Star Wars trilogy. Indiana Jones himself, Harrison Ford, was reaping the benefits of success from both the Star Wars series as well as the first installment of Indiana Jones series and was eager for another go around with the hat and whip.  But what adventures awaited the adventurous archaeologist? The possibilities were limit-less but choosing the right one with just the right story elements proved to be more difficult then many would think.<br />The story takes place nearly a year before the events of the previous feature, Raider of the Lost Ark, and shows the venturesome archaeologist in rare form, not battling Nazis for once.  In 1935, we find the reckless Indiana Jones in China seeking an artifact from a dangerous Chinese businessman named Lao Che but in his turbulent escape with his child partner, Short Round, he becomes involved with a bombshell named Willie Scott, who ends up tagging along for the ride. The adventure places the group in a small village in India which finds itself under a curse after a group named the Maharajah of Pankot steals the sacred stone that has kept the town prosperous for hundreds of years. Not only that but it appears that at the same the time the stone was taken, all the children of the village mysteriously disappeared. The native shaman begs Indy to travel to Pankot Palace and discover the source of this unspeakable evil plot. After being welcomed grandly by maharajah, the trio discovers a secret passage that leads tothe underground Temple of Doom, watched over by the evil Mola Ram, the high priest of a cult known as the Thuggees. Can the audacious adventurer find his way out of voodoo curses and perilous mines? The story for Indiana Jones & the Temple of Doom is a decent outing for those looking for escapism but it doesn't quite live up to the standards set by the original film. For one, the romantic angle between Indy and Willie Scott is lacking and doesn't match up to the one in Raiders. Secondly, the plot lacks the religious connection with the audience that Raiders and Crusade showcased, which is probably why it is the least enduring of the three films. And thirdly, as entertaining as he might, the addition of Short Round ends up being more of an annoyance then a plus to the story's plot line.<br />Another great thing about the Indiana Jones series is that it isn't afraid to switch up its supporting cast from film to film because the filmmakers know that the only thing that matters is how they interact with Harrison Ford on screen. Harrison Ford, who had just completed his stint as Hans Solo in Lucas' epic Star Wars series, gives another exhilarating performance as Indiana Jones and proves once again that he is fit for the role, no matter what is thrown at him in it. Ford works perfectly well by himself despite the annoyances of Kate Capshaw and Ke Huy Quan. Kate Capshaw, who would later marry director Steven Spielberg, just doesn't fit well into this film at all. Her hysterics come off as being more annoying then hilarious and she lacks chemistry when paired up romantically with Harrison Ford. Ke Huy Quan, who performs as Short Round in the film, is another case of a character being more of an annoyance and a distraction then an increment. Sure, his attitude and the way he speaks might be humorous, cute even, as the feature starts out but as it progresses, patience wares thin especially in the more serious aspects of the film.<br />Overall, Temple of Doom continues the thrilling adventures of Indiana Jones but fails to surpass the standards set by Raiders of the Lost Ark just a few years before. Unlike the previous installment, the supporting cast is more of a hindrance then anything else and just doesn't compliment the wonderful performance given by Harrison Ford. Also unlike Raiders, Doom lacks the romantic integrity and the religious implications that made the series so enduring to movie-goers. The darker overtones also alienate many who had grown accustomed to the series' light-hearted fare but not to such an extent that it ruins the experience entirely who do sit down and watch it. Despite its obvious inferior enduring quality behind Raiders of the Lost Ark, Temple of Doom remains an entertaining feature for Harrison Ford's engaging performance and the beautiful landscapes alone.
B00004SST6|5.0|This is one of George's best CD's to date! He's still the smoothest there is ! People need to just get over the fact that he's so talented he has the widest fan base of any jazz artist ever! He can sing. That's why he has an added dimension in his soloing with the guitar. His guitar literally sings and scats! I'm tired of these so called jazz purists tripping over the fact that he's got a great voice and has fans that appreciate it as well. Back to this album.<BR>I absolutely loved this whole album and can't wait for the next. If you have a chance to get the DVD be sure to because he does most of these cuts live and he really cuts loose. He and Joe Sample said they waited 30 years to work together! Joe Sample stated, and I quote &quot; I don't think people understand, that George Benson is and INCREDIBLE guitarist!&quot;  <BR>  I think that should be the name of his next album. &quot;INCREDIBLE BENSON!&quot;

0440237688|5.0|'The Giver' has been my favorite book ever since 8th grade. This is the type of book that really makes you wonder about the world. Will we live like the Jetson's in the future? Will we still live on earth? Will there be life on other planets? How will our world be run? All these questions run through my mind while reading a book like this. 'The Giver' is an excellent book and is also a very easy read. I read this book when I was in 8th grade and I loved it, and now that I have read it again as a senior I still love it!!
B00005JMJ4|1.0|to state it simply, this film has no plot, no action and no real meaning other than trying to make us identify with a couple of rich and spoiled bores who despite having an all expense paid trip to a wonderful city do nothing but complain about how difficult their life is...it seems like only a girl whose father was a famous director and who never had to work a day in her life could write and direct such a film..come to think of it..that is who directed this film.
0345440900|5.0|I read this book over and over while I was pregnant. It is easy to read and easy to implement. I even took it to the hospital with me for reference and highlighted passages for my husband to read so we would be in sync. Every single piece of advice works, is easy to implement and makes great sense. WITH ONE HUGE EXCEPTION. Tracy's advice on how to breast feed, although at first seeming to make logical sense, DOES NOT WORK. Following her advice to breastfeed one side at each feeding, which I truly believed and followed diligently, caused me much HEARTACHE AND TEARS when the doctor told me the baby was not growing at the proper rate and recommended formula. I still persisted because all her other advice was so right on. But it has taken three months to get back to sole breastfeeding, on both sides, and no more formula, thanks to lactation consultants, acupuncture and TOTAL persistance on my part. SO, buy the book, it is amazing, helpful, loving, smart, funny and IT WORKS. BUT DO NOT follow her advice on breasfeeding.
B00005JMJ4|1.0|somparing this film to Monsoon Wedding only goes to show how some hype from out of touch critics can actually lead to a film with nothing to it actually being nominated.  If you want to see a film with real substance then see Monsoon Wedding.
B0000CFW87|5.0|I remember seeing Josh Groban on Ally McBeal two differant times and thinking , this guy is pretty good. Then he appeared in Anaheim in the American league playoffs singing &quot; The Star Spangled Banner&quot; better than I,ve ever heard it sung, and in a way not glorifing himself. I wanted to find out just who this singer was and if had made any recordings. Amazon.com and his fans made me all the information I needed. I purchased the first Josh Groban album and picked up Closer as soon as was available.I had the priviledge of seeing Josh in person in Milwaukee Feb 8th and he was fabulous. He started out with Oceano and than included approx 20 more of his recordings &quot; You lift me up&quot; &quot;broken vows&quot; etc. It,s been said that a tear does,nt need interpretation is why some of his song,s in Italian,Spanish or French are so powerful. This singer at his young age and humble composer and absolute great voice in my opinion has no equal. This is a must album if you love music...

B0000E64TQ|5.0|This is a great album, which now sounds even better. Even on my regular CD player (this is a hybrid and plays on both regular and SACD players), it sounds much better than the 1996 remastered CD. My only complaint is that many of this \\"Deluxe\\" series don't need to be 2-CD sets (the double album would fit on one CD, and the bonus tracks are unecessary since 3 of the 4 are already on the 1996 remastered \\"Don't Shoot Me\\" CD).
0345440900|5.0|This book saved my sanity.  Tracy's EASY cycle and her tips on baby signals really helped me figure out when my 5-week old was hungry, tired, over-stimulated, gassy, or bored.  Before that, I was clueless - I was trying to feed my baby when all she wanted was to go to sleep!  Tracy also has great tips on breaking bad habits in your baby - they took patience and perseverance but worked like a charm.  Out of all the baby books I've read (Dr. Sears &quot;The Baby Book&quot;, &quot;The Mother of All Baby Books&quot;, &quot;What to Expect the First Year&quot; and several others) this book is by far the most helpful and informative and right on the money.  Definitely give it a read - if you can, read it _before_ you have your baby so you'll start off on the right track.
0345457684|5.0|The film noir  of  Cyber-punk!!  I could hardly put this book down.  The ideas in this book about cloning, digital consciousness, body modification, and immortality made for fresh and exciting read.<br />And even if there was no &quot;sci-fi&quot; part of the book, the &quot;mystery&quot; of this book, I feel, held its own in the mystery genre. The plot moved smooth and steady with no &quot;slow&quot; spots. I think being written in first-person made the mystery more entertaining than if it would have been in third-person.<br />Richard Morgan did a great job of not giving too much away but keeping the reader interested with great ending. For those of you out there in cyberspace that love sci-fi and love a good mystery, this is a must read!!!!!!
0060934719|5.0|This story was a delightful fairytale, perfect for an older audience (though appropriate for young ones as well) looking for a great story full of fantasy and magic, yet compelling enough to keep older readers hooked. It's hard to find good fairytales that aren't either slow paced or childish. Stardust is an excellent fairytale. Definately worth buying!
B000008LOV|5.0|This album is brilliant! This was definitely one of the most exciting music projects to come out of the '80s. There had been &quot;super-groups&quot; before, like the Yardbirds or Blind Faith, but it was unprecedented to have FIVE well-established rock 'n roll greats (Roy Orbison, Bob Dylan, George Harrison, Jeff Lynne and Tom Petty) form their own band and bring out two records, and it was a trans-Atlantic collaboration. The story goes that ex-ELO maestro Jeff was helping produce new albums by George and the others, when they decided, &quot;Hey, why not try to bring out a whole album together?!&quot;<BR>Part of the beauty of Traveling Wilburys Vol. 1 is that it is so under-stated. It's not like the five guys were saying, &quot;Look at us, we're a super-group!&quot; No, they got pure enjoyment from their collaboration, appearing almost mysteriously as five &quot;Wilbury&quot; brothers. You first had to figure out who those guys in sunglasses were on the album cover.<BR>That notwithstanding, this album was also invaluable for the appreciation it gave the legendary Roy Orbison for a new generation. It made me interested in his songs from way back, even before the movie Pretty Woman gave him new exposure. Sadly, Orbison died soon after Traveling Wilburys Vol. 1 was released. The band commemorated his passing in their music video for the single, &quot;End of the Line.&quot; When Orbison sings, a guitar is shown in an otherwise empty rocking chair.<BR>But the first song I heard from this album was the catchy story-song, &quot;Tweeter and the Monkey Man.&quot; It was Bob Dylan, but it was more. What a great song! It got a lot of airplay in South Africa, where I grew up. The first single, &quot;Handle With Care,&quot; is also excellent, with Harrison leading the vocals and the other guys chiming in.<BR>Bob does a great job on &quot;Dirty World,&quot; which has some really funny tongue-in-cheek lyrics, e.g., &quot;I love her big refrigerator.&quot; &quot;Rattled&quot; is fine rockabilly sung by Jeff Lynne and with Roy adding his trademark growls. &quot;Last Night&quot; with its reggae beat is probably my favorite track, a humorous story of misguided love as sung by Petty and with a fine bridge by Orbison. Roy himself shines on the track written for him, &quot;Not Alone Anymore.&quot; &quot;Margarita&quot; on side two is also an excellent song with the guys trading lead vocals.<BR>Jeff Lynne's production, as well as familiar vocals by the parts of the whole, gave continuity to the Wilburys' solo albums: George's Cloud Nine, Petty's Full Moon Fever, Orbison's Mystery Girl and Lynne's own Armchair Theatre. I think of these albums as collectively being the missing Vol. 2.<BR>We await the re-issue of Vol. 1 and Vol. 3 on CD. Warner Brothers, are you listening?
B00018D44U|1.0|~ Know this:  this album is MUCH MUCH more like COUNTRY music and utterly unlike her previous CD.  I loved the first CD so much that I bought the second w/o having listened to it. <BR>    Big mistake - unless you are a country music fan, then you might still like this style.  Since the sound clips on this website don't do the CD justice (or give you a taste of the annoying parts), I'll try to explain the &quot;country&quot; feel of the CD:<br />1.  &quot;Sunrise&quot;:  beat and instrumentals conjures up an image of a cowboy on the range.  Beat has a lazy gallop to it. Could easily be a country song for children's entertainment (has &quot;jovial&quot; instrumentals that just alienate adult listeners).<BR>2. &quot;What Am I To You&quot;:  enter the twangy guitar (country style)<BR>3. &quot;Those Sweet Words&quot;: some light piano playing, percussion (this song is bearable, similar to the style of the first CD)<BR>4. &quot;Carnival Town&quot;:  here the style Nora is singing in is quasi- country with elongated words that have an emphasis in the middle (especially the word &quot;lonely&quot; that is repeated ad nauseam)- make it stop!<BR>5. &quot;In The Morning&quot;:  country beat, Nora's singing style is country as well, <BR>6. &quot;Be Here to Love Me&quot;:  entirely country, twangy guitar, country lyrics, lazy beat (not pensive like the first CD)... Nora's singing is not harmonious but instead whiney <BR>7.  &quot;Creepin' In&quot;:  square-dancing beat, sounds like a Dolly Parton singing style (this is where I usually make the CD changer go to another album)<br /> That's it, I simply can't listen to anymore, this review gives you an idea of what you're in for, which is more than I had. I recommend finding a store with a listening station or borrowing a friend's CD to listen to before buying.  You'll know what I mean. <BR>*** Good luck ***
0385504209|5.0|This is a SUPERB thriller! But let's be clear - it never intends to be fine literature, with richly developed characters.<br />The characters of this story are merely props, to propel a FABULOUS plot.

B00009W0WM|5.0|Casablanca has been beautifully restored and the extras only enhance the movie experience.
B00005MP58|4.0|Pride and Prejudice is one of my favourite books of all time. I have read the book countless times and have the three movie versions: the A&amp;E miniseries (1995) with Colin Firth/Jennifer Ehle, the BBC production (1979) with David Rintoul/Elizabeth Garvie, and the 1940 movie with Laurence Olivier/Greer Garson.<br />The Olivier/Garson movie is an amusing film but bears no resemblance to Jane Austen's novel at all. Purists beware - you will be horrified!<br />Which brings me to the A&amp;E version...  Had I never watched the BBC 1979 series, I would've given A&amp;E 5 stars for bringing the novel to life. We need more well-made dramatizations of classic novels. However, having the BBC version makes you aware of the many weaknesses in the A&amp;E miniseries. The A&amp;E filmmakers took many liberties in &quot;modernizing&quot; the plot. Why they felt compelled to tamper with Austen's story I have no idea - unless they thought that adding scenes of a wet Colin Firth (twice!) would attract the female audience or a chesty Lydia Bennett sprawled in bed would charm the male audience.<br />The casting and acting in the BBC version is superior to the A&amp;E. Elizabeth Garvie and David Rintoul played Elizabeth and Darcy perfectly. Colin Firth, wet or dry, was fine as Darcy, although I don't think he was haughty enough; however, he badly needed a haircut and shave and looked more like a Heathcliff than a Darcy. Jane, the eldest of the Bennett girls, is supposed to be a beauty -- and she was, in the BBC version. Alas, the A&amp;E Jane was quite plain and looked as if she had a goitre problem. A&amp;E's Mrs. Bennett overacted terribly, screeching annoyingly throughout the film.<br />On a positive note, the cinematography in the A&amp;E version was wonderful. Although the music in the BBC version was probably more appropriate for that setting, I enjoyed the lively soundtrack of the A&amp;E much more. And finally, one drawback to the 1979 version is that it is available only on VHS, as far as I know.<br />I did enjoy the A&amp;E miniseries and I give it 4 stars. However, if you are a Jane Austen fan, I recommend the BBC version, which is beautifully acted, perfectly cast and a truer representation of the novel.on VHS, as far as I know. <br />I did enjoy the A&amp;E miniseries and I give it 4 stars.

B0000B1OFL|4.0|The Italian Job is a smart action movie with chase scenes above and below the streets.<br />This is a DVD well worth buying.
B00005JLT5|5.0|Iam almost speechless to explain just how horrifying a motion picture this really is!That in fact much of what we are asked to view is actually based on true events is equally as disturbing.I would find that there was much personal information that was placed in context of the Third Reich occupation of Poland and the creeping calculation of annilation that placed any efforts to survive as a premium that was virtually fruitless.That the garden was virtually barren and the green of spring was dried to a crisp is to suggest that what was attempted by the forces of the Third Reich brought the end of the world in sight.This is not a picture for the faint of heart for there is such a terrifying calculation to certain death that the only greater shame would of been when the victorious Russian Army was searching thru the occupied communites and almost shot to death the pianist who in order not to freeze to death wore a german coat to keep warm.To me that would of been a defeat to knock you out of your chair,however,thank God,that defeat was not to be.It is an un-nerving event that this individual survived and even more so why we couldnt get to that monster sooner.Though this dear reader is not to place controversy at those that perished during the occupation,the victorious Russian Forces were to be required to surrender the lives of some ten million before they entered into Berlin.Even today with such devastation just a crisis away there may never be a time when such would be the case as was told of in this motion picture.I dont like a whole lot of politics however a concept of eternal vigilance may seem more appropiate than a recommendation to see this picture.I viewed this on DVD,it was a rental from a local library.I do not recommend this film to be viewed by anyone under the age 18 or even perhaps 21.If the adult wants to view this film they should be forewarned,again this is not for the faint of heart!
B00005JMJ4|1.0|Tokyo is a bewildering city for foreigners, if only because of its sheer size and of course the language barrier. But this movie beats the culture shock theme like a dead horse and jams every Japan cliche into its 105 minutes. I read in an interview that Sofia Coppola has spent some time living in Tokyo, which I find astonishing since Lost in Translation doesn't demonstrate the astuteness or sensibility of someone familiar with the place. No, Japanese are not uniformly short and not everything on Japanese TV is a wacky variety show (or b/w Kurosawa classic). And there are not many Japanese who speak otherwise decent English, but still confuse &quot;l&quot; and &quot;r&quot; sounds with such hilarity. I stayed at the Park Hyatt in Tokyo last year, I'm 6'6&quot; and can attest that I had no issues with the height of my shower. If anything, I find Tokyo surprisingly accomodating for a person of tall stature, especially compared with other places in Asia. What can I say? This movie is total exaggeration. Why on earth would Bill Murray's character take the girl to some non-descript hospital where no staff speak a word of English - when Tokyo is packed with medical facilities and services catering to expats? But aside from all this, the characters themselves are a bit unconvincing. I did not buy the girl as a Yale philosophy graduate considering the trite dialogue of the heart-to-heart sessions and i have never known any self-respecting philsophy graduate to listen to self-improvement audio tapes. And Bill Murray's character, married 25 years but only just experiencing the monotony of married life with a young kid. Then there's the photographer husband (he seems about 18 years old) and a vain actress, neither really developed to any extent, and several token Japanese for flavor. It baffles me why this movie has received such acclaim.
B00018D44U|3.0|I bought the CD over a week ago and I have still not heard the entire CD. I'm sure N Jones' new CD is great as many of you fans have written but I have yet to finish it because I am constantly annoyed by the Bandlink player. Safe to say this was one of my first CD purchases in a long time and it will probably be the last for a while. I could have downloaded Kazza, then the songs, and burned a CD with less hassle.  If the Record companies and RIAA want to keep selling CDs, they better take this CRAP software out of their CDs.  Here I was for once buying a CD as RIAA asked and then they surprise me with this &quot;wonderful&quot; POS software for my computer. I'll let this CD collect dust while I go download the songs and burn it on my own CD to listen to without having to give out information on the songs that I listen to to Bandlink and RIAA crap people. Little wonder why people stopped buying CDs from RIAA companies who can produce CDs for less than a dollar and lots less than a cassette yet still sell them for double the price. Makes perfect sense to me. Rip off your customers who they think doesn't know any better and you'll get customers who rip your songs off the internet. I guess what goes around comes around, and round and round.
0517548232|3.0|This is a very old book.<BR>The author is talking from a 50 year away point of view... so it's like reading something very thought-provoking that was written 50 years ago (the ideas are still valid, but it seems that you are reading something that you discovered on your grand-father's book-shelf).<BR>The way the book is written seems like if you were living in a socialist country, and the author is tryig to slap you in the face and trying to convince you that the open and free-market capitalism is the right choice. He tries very hard to force you to see that it's very, very wrong to think otherwise.<br />In the end, the book still has some valid ideas, and presents the Economy as Thatcher and Reagan viewed it.<BR>I think this is a very basic book, with no graphics, no analisys, just plain talk. Talks about the things modern Economics live on as if it was the greatest discovery on the modern world, even if nowadays we take it for granted.<br />Just good if you want to know a bit about Economics and you don't like to see graphics or analise any kind of data.<BR>Try to read &quot;Principles of Macroeconomics&quot; if you want an up-to-date approach to the same subjects in a thicker and more in-depth book (although written for begginners).

B00005JN08|4.0|EUROTRIP is not for everyone!  There is more nudity in this film than the three AMERICAN PIE and PORKY'S films combined (a lot of which happens to be male).  There are drug references, sex, and bad language.  It is, also, extremely funny.  If you made EUROPEAN VACATION really perverted, then this is what you'd have.  There is no need to rate the \\"artistic expression.\\"  If you like this type of movie, you won't be disappointed.

B000050XEI|5.0|When Enya became a singer on her own, it was a great idea. I'm not saying Clannad has bad music (I love their music), but they do well on their own and Enya has such great music, all of her albums are worth adding to your collection.<br />At first when I heard Enya, it was always in the car - my dad played it. I always thought Enya was a band or something - I didn't even know the name that well. Then I was given this CD for my birthday, and I loved it. I then started listening to all of Enya's music more and more.<br />Though this CD is only about a half hour long, it's worth it to buy it. The songs are all great.<br />1.

0385504209|5.0|This book was a great work of fiction.  Just the thought that something like that could have really happened is pretty amazing and it's fun to get swept up in the writings of a talented author.  After reading this I was compelled to look up further information on the web, and that was pretty exciting as well.  It's just a good story to get lost in.  Too many people are freaking out as to whether this could possibly could have happened in history.  I say just sit back, read, and have fun.  If nothing else it's a good story.
B00005Y228|3.0|The Aussie pop diva Kylie Minogue returned to the airwaves in 2001 with her smash hit ''Can't Get You Out Of My Head''. The song was an instant hit in Europe, topping the No. 1 spot for 4 weeks straight in The UK. ''Can't Get You Out Of My Head'' put Kylie Minogue back on the American marked, having been absent for numerous years, the Americans embraced her music once again. Despite disappearing from the American charts, Kylie Minogue has always been an Australian and UK favourite. Her 2000's ''Light Years'' gave the Aussie a UK No.1 with 'Spinning Around'' and the singles from the album enjoyed great chart success as well. <BR> <BR>2001's ''Fever'' raced up the charts around Europe and Australian as it was released, mainly due to the bouncy, danceable ''Can't Get You Out Of My Head''. If fans were expecting something similar, they weren't disappointed. The album follows the same music style as the lead single.<br />The album opens with the disco-inspired ''More More More'', which sets the pace for the ''Fever'' album. The fun and energetic song is a bit repetitive at times with its ''More More More'' throughout the song, however it's still quite catchy and enjoyable. A great opener for the album giving the listener the urge to hear ''More More More''. The music is a bit cluttered at times, but the hook is contagious. <BR>My favourite song on ''Fever'' is the boogie romp ''Love At First Sight''  It has a killer beat and is highly enjoyable. Her vocals suit the song perfectly. I love how the pace picks up in the chorus, giving it a climax each time the chorus appears. It was the dance anthem of 2002. It was the third single release in Europe from ''Fever''. It earned Kylie Minogue a top 3 hit in the UK. The video appeared to be quite simple compared to the ''Can't Get You Out Of My Head'' video.  I believe the US version was a bit different to the European one. It seems it was more bass-driven. I could be wrong since I have only heard it one or two times. I prefer the original one though the difference isn't that visible anyway.  <br />What can I say about ''Can't Get You Out My Head'', which hasn't already been said. Er nothing. If you haven't heard this song during 2001/2002, surely you must have been living under a rock or having been abducted by aliens. It was the biggest single in Europe in 2001 and among the five best selling singles in the UK in 2001. Its infectious beat and the 'LaLaLa' lyrics proved all it takes to get a hit on your hands is an awesome beat and sing-along lyrics even a 3 year old can enjoy. The offering isn't a favourite of mine, but I can enjoy the song for the great beat. <br />''Fever'', ''Give It To Me'' and ''Fragile'' are among the weaker offerings on the album. The title track has the silliest lyrics you can imagine. It has quite an annoying beat accompany it. Catchy chorus though. I don't particularly care for the song at all. ''Give In To Me'' has a telephone-like bleeping noise going on. No guessing what Kylie is alluring to. Definitely a filler and one I easily could do without. ''Fragile'' is the 'slowest' song on the album, yet it still has that overall eletro pop sound to it. ''Come Into My World'' is another highlight on the ''Fever'' album. and I believe it won a 2004 Grammy Award for Best Dance Song (?) and deservedly so. Its suggestive lyrics inviting you to ''Come Into Her World'' works extremely well with the breezy, breathy chorus/hook. The vocals suit the song perfectly. The video sees multiples of Kylie Minogue and it was heavily played on various music channels. It was released as the fourth and final single off the album. The trance-inspired track ''In Your Eyes'' was lifted as the second single in Europe. The danceable beat and sultry vocals had everyone dancing. <br />''Dancefloor'' is an up-beat song, which seemingly is inspired by the disco days. On ode to the good ol' days of boogie. It sound like it could have been on the ''Light Years'' album with its cheesy lyrics. ''Love Affair'' continues the synthesizer-pop sound. ''Your Love'' has light guitar playing throughout the song.  It doesn't sound as ''over-produced'' as the rest of the songs on ''Fever''. The plain mid-tempo song is a fresh and bubbly contrast compared to the eletro/dance sound dominating the ''Fever'' album.<BR>The final offering ''Burning Up'' sees Kylie opening the song with sultry vocals. It works really well. Then the beat sets in and that completely ruins the song for my liking. The contrast, between the verses and the choruses, doesn't work  and the ''Burning Up'' throughout the song gets annoying after only so long.<br />Kylie Minogue has never been afraid of taking chances. Her latest album ''Body Language'' is a testament to that. She doesn't seem to take herself all that seriously, which is quite refreshing in a business were everyone tries hard to do exactly that. It's a given that Kylie Minogue doesn't have a powerful voice in any sense of the word, however she uses the little she does have quite well on ''Fever''.<br />Why only 3 stars you ask? Well the overall sound tends to be a bit repetitive. The single releases are the best songs on the ''Fever''. The rest of the material doesn't have the same potential as the single releases. ''Fever'' is a good dance/pop album and if you enjoy some light pop music ''Fever'' is the album for you. Personally I prefer ''Body Language'' over ''Fever'', but ''Fever'' is highly enjoyable and a guilty pleasure of mine<br />Overall Rate: 7/10
B0000TB01Y|5.0|As I started reading through the reviews people had been leaving about &quot;Wicked&quot; I was saddened to see how certain viewers critically reviewed it saying, 'it wasn't what I had expected', or 'I generally did not enjoy it but the music was alright'. It's unfortunate that so many of you cannot simply enjoy &quot;Wicked&quot; for what it is, instead of downsizing its magnitude, professionalism, and strength as a musical. For a newbie to Broadway, it's power and unique approach (along with composition and musical score), makes it one of the finest productions on stage today. I saw &quot;Wicked&quot; last night with 50 other members of our local choir and orchestra. I loved it, and didn't discount it with criticism and negative this' and thats'. <BR>Most of you who negatively review the play usually have read the book before hand. I do not believe that all opinions should be based singularly off of the book. If that is how you come into any show, or book (knowing a version of it beforehand), you never get to have that glorious feeling of never knowing what to expect. That's where I believe that most people begin to find flaws with things. You find flaws in the play because you are expecting the book. Well, it's very loosely based, but still a very wonderful, beautiful, and deeply symbolic production that will go far. You (some) mention that its &quot;cheesy&quot; or &quot;childlike&quot;. Why does that make it bad? Can't we all just watch and enjoy it for what it is, if you make the connections and enjoy it even more, great for you!<br />I loved &quot;Wicked&quot; and I certainly reccomend it for any theater lover. Don't listen to people who say it's horrible, it's the complete opposite, it's wickedly fantastick!<br />Defying Gravity As Always<BR>~Wicked Fan~
B0000DD7NL|5.0|After her first release &quot;Songs In A Minor&quot;, I didn't think she would be able to come close on a sophmore effort.  She proved me wrong.  She shows her incredible talent and singing ability throughout this entire album from beginning to end.
6304806426|5.0|There are English Patient loving people and English Patient hating people - and therein is an explanation for many failed relationships and marriages. Ideally, online dating services should only pair EP lovers with same and EP haters with same. It should be a deal breaker.<br />The film is, ultimately, an Anthony Minghella film of a Miramax Production, and that pedigree should tell anyone what they need to know. If you thought Minghella's \\"The Talented Mr. Ripley\\" was excessive, over long, high toned, homoerotic dreck, than stay away from the English Patient. The love in English Patient is all hetro hot, but the literary notions and expansive storytelling, where the insight is obvious but the telling sublime, is the point of the film. If you're a Cliff's Notes or action comics or video game person, it's not for you. If you love reading a classical novel, no matter how many tangents, digressions and verbal loops the author goes into to communicate their cumulative apprehension of the piece, then buy this film.<br />The beautiful parts are stunning, and the parts that are \\"over the top\\" or \\"over wrought\\" in some viewers opinion are no more so than the excesses in an opera, which one may sit through bemused as much as impressed, charmed by the lovely lyric and moved by the fine score it's all wrapped in.<br />The film is also worth watching as the piece in with Ralph Fiennes patented the character he has played over and over again through out his entire film career, including the proto version in Schindler's List: the stoic, emotionally remote, cool, sophisticated man who, once smitten by love, becomes an obsessive, emotionally unhinged and self destructive mess. He is very good at this maneuver, and this is a world class performance of his own, personal, character genre.
B00012FXAE|4.0|It may not be the first one but it is a very good sequil anyway. ( Make that only good sequil) Since the alien movies become even more horrible and less scary, they make this movie look like a classic. The only thing wrong with this movie is that   the marines make it seem boring. But buy it anyway.
B00001ODGR|5.0|Wow, this dvd was an amazing surprise. I picked this DVD up after becoming a huge Styx fan. The video and sound quality are excellent. I didn't expect it to be anywhere near as good as it is. The music selection couldn't be better. It doesn't have one bad song on it. <br />Dennis Deyoung sounds excellent. You can really appreciate his talent in Suite Madame Blues and Come Sail Away. No one could do the songs like him. <br />The DVD has an interview with Tommy Shaw. It lasts about 5 minutes. There are also pictures and the history of Styx on the DVD.<br />Overall, this DVD couldn't get much better. It has great sound, great video, great musicians, and great features. If you like Styx in any way, I suggest you get this DVD immediately.
6305388458|3.0|I love Holy Grail and all of the Flying Circuses, and was excited to see this film. I was very disappointed with it. While it did have some funny parts, such as Pontius Pilate and Biggus' speech impediments and the roman graffiti, a lot of it was unnecessary and sacreligious. Was it important to the story to show Graham Chapman fully naked? What about the other woman's nudity, pushing the envelope even for some of today's standards. If that was what I wanted to see in a movie, I would have never turned to Monty Python. I also found the movie to be very sacreligious. While there were no direct attacks on Christ or Christians in general, the different situations in the movie were screaming blasphemy. A lot of religious parodies are aimed at Christianity, and to be honest, I think that if this moive would have referred to Islam or Hinduism, or any other religion, it would be seen as degrading towards that religion. Putting that aside, though, the movie was funny. Eric Idle's song, &quot;The Bright Side Of Life&quot; is a classic. The roman graffiti will always be remembered, and the rivalry between the People's Front of Judea and the Judean People's Front was humorous. Overall, the movie was very average in humor, but is pulled down dramatically by the blasphemy in the film. I don't recommend it unless you are a huge Monty Python fan.
B00005JMJ4|5.0|i honesty cannot think of anything to say about this movie. the amazon review is right, it is like a great dream...on dvd. <br />not a lot happens, but the general vibe of it is just...relaxing and, subtle.
B00005JKBC|4.0|I am not a great action movie fan - but I will watch almost anything associated with Robert Redford, whose \\"Three Days of the Condor\\" and \\"All the President's Men\\" are among my all-time favorites; as is \\"A River Runs Through It,\\" his first collaboration with Brad Pitt. So, I figured, with these two in co-starring roles I couldn't really go wrong with \\"Spy Game\\"; and I certainly wasn't disappointed.    Told from a 1991 perspective - two years after the fall of the Berlin Wall, when the CIA changed from an agency run by operatives with field experience to one run by \\"suits\\" - \\"Spy Game\\" flashes back to the cold war, when American politics' overriding goal was to outmaneuver the Russian-controlled communist block; although Middle Eastern politics eventually did add more complexity. (Shot before, but released after September 11, 2001, as director Tony Scott and producers Douglas Wick and Marc Abraham note on the DVD's commentary tracks, the WTC attack had some effect on the editing process). The story begins with CIA operative Tom Bishop (Pitt)'s capture during an unauthorized rescue attempt in a Chinese prison, resulting in his former supervisor Nathan Muir (Redford)'s summons, on his last day in office, to a meeting of the agency's top brass, for an account of their operations between 1975 (their first meeting in Vietnam) and 1985 (their last operation in Beirut). However, already tipped off to Bishop's capture by an old confidant in the U.S. embassy in Hong Kong, as Muir gives his report his suspicion is quickly confirmed that his information won't be used to save Bishop but to construe a reason to let the Chinese execute him. So it is left to Muir, several thousand miles away, to come to his former protege's aid; and in so doing, break all his rules of survival: Put away some money to retire in a warm spot, never touch that money for anyone, never risk your life or career for an outsider, and if an agent goes \\"off the reservation\\" (engages in an unauthorized operation), don't go after him trying to pull him out.    Of course, most of this has been done before; in the aforementioned Redford movies, countless other celluloid tales of the past 50 years and the novels of writers who have built entire careers on this kind of material, from John le Carre to Tom Clancy and Frederick Forsyth. But \\"Spy Game\\" was directed by Tony Scott, who, like his brother Ridley, has already left his mark on the genre (see \\"Enemy of the State\\" and \\"Crimson Tide\\") and, with his arts and advertising background, understands that action movies are about visuals at least as much as about plot and character development: weak editing and camerawork will sink an action thriller as assuredly as weak acting. And Scott's direction is spot-on, in his choice of camera angles, movement and even coloring (providing every chapter with a unique color scheme), as well as his editing, so fast-paced that there are several details you only pick up on in your second or third viewing. Even in the largely static scenes in the CIA conference room, thanks to numerous small tricks, great dialogue and a cast of outstanding actors - including Stephen Dillane as Muir's intra-agency opponent Harker and Larry Bryggman as CIA vice-director Folger - Scott never loses the viewer's interest.    I do have a few issues with \\"Spy Game\\" - leaving aside that, as in most spy flicks, there are some sequences where I have to suspend just a bit too much of my disbelief (like the East Berlin sequences of the operation used to set up American mole Anne Cathcart [Charlotte Rampling] and parts of Muir's rescue operation for Bishop), I think it is a pity that a director/producer team otherwise so focused on authenticity didn't realize how many people would remember Robert Redford's looks in films like the above-mentioned ones, i.e. from the mid-1970s, coinciding with this movie's Vietnam and Berlin episodes; for although Redford has definitely gained in class and authority with his growing number offacial lines, which well behoove Tom Bishop's mentor, arguably there should have been at least some visible age difference between Muir's 1975 and 1991 looks. And just as an aside, from a native Berliner: Guys, much as I applaud your choice to substitute nightly Budapest streets for those of cold-war East Berlin, you shouldn't also have filmed the rooftop scene there, because neither the city's overall look nor its topography pans out to those who actually knew Berlin then. (Not to mention the \\"vopos\\"' obvious Hungarian accents and a few other details I won't go into here.)    But overall this movie is certainly a cut above the rest of its class, due to great directorial work as much as that of Redford, Pitt and Catherine McCormack as Elizabeth Hadley, the woman who finally comes between them in Beirut: Redford as the inscrutable, controlling master spy - whose past is, unlike in the original screenplay, kept suitably ambiguous -, Pitt as the young gun, aptly codenamed \\"Boy Scout,\\" who is not above exploiting \\"assets\\" for an operation's sake but does fall in love with the wrong woman at last, and McCormack as the tough, no-frills activist whose feelings for Bishop ultimately endanger not only him but also herself. - Last but not least, Harry Gregson-Williams's soundtrack deserves special mention: With an excellent blend of classic rock tunes (Joe Walsh's \\"Rocky Mountain Way\\" and Dire Straits' \\"Brothers in Arms\\" ... where are these on the soundtrack CD???) and a score alternating between middle eastern and Asian melodies, a boy soprano (Bishop & Hadley's love theme) and techno grooves, it is always in tune with the action and provides a perfect frame for the movie's voyage from Langley to Vietnam, Berlin, Beirut and China. This may not be one of film history's all-time greatest moments - but it is a well-crafted thriller and definitely worth watching if you're looking for some action.

1920769005|5.0|This has to one of the best books that i have read. The pace that it moves along at and the detail and storytelling ability of the author hints at a talent nurtured over many years of experience.<BR>Its a hefty 900 odd pages (in hardback), but very hard to put down. Its one of those rare books that have you laughing and thinking from the first page, totally involving and utterly compelling.<BR>The novel is about the Indian mafia, scrapes and skirmishes, love &amp; friendships and a view of the wilder side of life by real life Australian prison escapee Gregory Roberts. This is not really a review but a recommendation for a very worthwhile read.
B00008H2LB|5.0|It makes me angry that intelligent people like the ones who comment in this demoralize this obviously talented band by writing such idiotic comments as &quot;they just suck.&quot; Gee, thanks for the info. If you hate it so much, why are you even typing the ridiculous crap which was spewing from your keyboard when you wrote the review? To the ones who can actually spell: Perhaps you are older than six. You're forgiven. For the time being. Get better tastes in music, or stop posting crap. Please.<BR>This is an amazing album, with sounds from the hip-hop beats of &quot;Nobody's Listening&quot; to the rock styled sounds of &quot;Faint&quot;. Get the album, listen to the lyrics. They actually say something. Intriguing, no?
B00005JMJ4|2.0|This movie is watchable as a travelogue as it captures Tokyo's urban landscape, but as an exploration of empty despair, loneliness, culture shock, blah blah blah, I found it neither insightful nor amusing. It feels as though Sofia Coppola came to Asia for the first time, had a sophomoric affectation by how different things are from America and proceeded to make this silly movie where the audience is supposed to ponder such things as - the novelty of jet lag - how the Japanese have trouble pronouncing r's (this is really exaggerated in the movie) and many Japanese do not even speak English...TV is different too. Culture shock and introspection ensues. Yes, how profound. This movie is no better than shows like The Amazing Race, where the rest of the world is just an exotic backdrop for Americans to run through and observe such differences.
B0000696I1|4.0|The Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles are back at again in this third installment to the very popular trilogy. Released in 1993, the plot centers around April and an ancient scepter which she discovered at an antique store. Unbeknowest to her it(scepter) has power to transport her back to 14th century Japan. April brings the antique to the turtles underground layer. Suddenly it begins to glow and with many special effects she is transported to Japan...1300's!! The Turtles go back as well to 14th century Japan to save their closest human companion. Along the way the Turtles befriend a little boy and have fun with the locals. There is even a person who looks just like Casey Jones ancient relative.<BR>     Although Many a critics and would be critics deadpanned this movie as being lame and tame, this it is not!! There is action galore and many special effects along with a charming and family friendly plot! However, it never ventures to anything that would bore an adult or child, it is very entertaining!<BR>      When this movie came out the popularity of the turtles was not what it once was but their icon did not and still hasn't died! Personally I even now an adult myself can still watch thier cartoons and their movies and reminisce. It just goes to show you that no one, the power rangers included, have never come close to the popularity and brightness of th Ninja Turtles! There never has been and never will be any cartoon, comic or movies based on a kid's show franchise than the four loveable turtles. So, if you're a true fan ,you always appreciate everything the thing or person you follow  and look over any differences that maybe visible from begining to end of their reign as the most popular super heroes of the late 80's and eraly 90's!  I recommend this movie as well as the other two that came before it.
B00005Q4CS|5.0|When I first started watching this movie, it interested me alot, but the more I watched it, the more and more disturbed I was, almost to the point of being horrified. I couldn't watch it the whole way thru the first time,from the fear of having nightmares!<BR>The fact that this movie has the ability to effect an individual to that point is astonishing. I think that if you have the stomach for it, it is an eye opening, gut-wrenching movie about drug addictions, and the terrible effects they can have.
B0000E1WKE|5.0|WOW! What an album. Whitney you have outdone yourself on this one. Every track, pure perfection, even the two last tracks,  which brings me back to the greatness of THE PREACHER'S WIFE Soundtrack. My favorite song on the album is &quot;O Come O Come Emmanuel&quot;, which gives you this Take 6 vibe with the throat and choral production. I feel that Whitney's talent is now being overshadowed by her personal problems, and it should not be that way. People have to realize that we are all human and do things that may make us fall off track but with the help of GOD, we can get back on our feet. I still feel that WHITNEY HOUSTON is the one of the most legendary divas in the industry. Hey so what she made her mistakes, EVERYONE NEEDS TO GET OVER IT and get back to the real reason she was put here, FOR US TO HEAR HER SING, NOT TO PRY INTO HER PERSONAL LIFE. I feel that's no one's business but hers and GOD's. STAY UP WHITNEY! YOUR TRUE FANS STILL LOVE YOU!
B0000C23DO|4.0|For a band with a duration of nearly thirty years, the Grateful Dead haven't been anthologized nearly as much as people might assume. Their San Francisco peers, the Steve Miller Band and the Jefferson Airplane have produced so many anthologies that it has underminded the integrity of their original releases. The Dead, on the other hand, have had a much longer career trajectory and this is the first single cd anthology that covers their entire career span...well, sort of.  This anthology is overly reliant on their Twin Towers studio albums, \\"Workingman's Dead\\" and \\"American Beauty\\". I have probably heard \\"Truckin'\\" over 10,000 times in my life and sitting though that song is the sonic equivalent of fingernails on a chalk board. \\"Uncle John's Band\\" seems to never wear thin and thousands of listenings later, it remains the most unique and powerful statement of the Dead's collective metaphysics.<br /><br />Among the missing and unaccounted for are; \\"Dark Star,\\" \\"Jack Straw,\\" \\"Black Peter,\\" \\"Stella Blue,\\" \\"Brokedown Palace,\\" \\"Playing in the Band,\\" \\"Wharf Rat,\\" and \\"Terrapin Station.\\" The biggest puzzler is what happened to \\"Aoxomoxoa\\" and \\"Anthem To Sun?\\" The tribal elders of the Deadhead nation are certain to frown upon any collection that omits \\"St. Stephen\\", \\"China Cat Sunflower\\", \\"The Other One\\" or \\"Alligator.\\" These two albums broke open more musicial space than any other Dead albums, and are the cornerstones of the Haight Ashbury psychedelic renissance.<br />Now that the Grateful Dead has remastered all of the 22 official albums, the hardcore Deadheads will probably want to recollect all of the orginal releases, because there is a significant improvement on the sound of the remastered editions. The track separation has dramtically improved the listenability of even some of their most ragged sounding efforts. Each time I've listened to the remastered editions of these tunes I've picked up on musical subtleties that were unmasked by the remixing of the analog masters, using the highly developed digital technology that we now call \\"state of the art\\". So for me, I will be buying (for the third time) all the 22 Grateful Dead offical releases that have been remastered. It will take some time however, because there seems to be no end to releases from Dick LaVala's archieves or ones from \\"The Vault\\" that keep on coming. Until I can afford to rebuy all of the remastered offical releases, this haphazard collection of Dead tunes sounds fantastic.sing the highly developed digital technology that we now call \\"state of the art\\".

B00005B36H|5.0|Alex the review of Tool's third album you posted is worth less than toilet paper.  How can you criticise an album as &quot;angsty puke&quot; when other artists such as SMASHING PUMPKINS and NIRVANA are the very definition of angsty puke, and you go on to award 5 star reviews to them!!!  This is also the same man that gave the ultimate classic album of the century LED ZEPPELIN IV not five not four, but yes, three stars and bagged the Velvet Underground, because he does not &quot;understand&quot; their music.  Alex, if you're someone who hates Lateralus so much, why did you go to the trouble of bagging their album then go and listen to their other albums.  Is it because you're some loner nerd with a lot of spare time on his hands and would like to see truly visionary music go down the toilet?  You obviously go with the flow and like whatever the public likes (NIRVANA, PUMPKINS, BEATLES), so you're opinion is not worth a f**king cent.  Thank you.<br />PS favourite songs on album are SCHISM, LATERALUS and THE GRUDGE.<BR>I saw A PERFECT CIRCLE live on thursday and they were amazing by the way.
0553801546|3.0|I've waited impatiently for the conclusion to the saga of Fitz and the Fool. While the book was as compulsively readable as all Ms Hobb's work, I found the ending inexpressibly disappointing. Conventional, mundane, even hum-drum. While a hum-drum life is certainly more pleasant living than one full of terrifying adventure, at my age I like something a little more challenging than 'and then they all lived happily ever after'.  Too bad - the author wasted a fantastically fraught premise.
B00008BXJG|5.0|\\"Back In Black\\" remains AC/DC's best and by far most succesful record, the best-selling hard rock/heavy metal album of all time.  But \\"Highway\\" is no throwaway either...the title song is one of rock's all-time classics, and the big riffs and the big, thumping backbeat helps make this the best and tightest collection of songs AC/DC had produced at the time.    Songs like \\"Love Hungry Man\\", \\"If You Want Blood\\", \\"Girls Got Rhythm\\" and \\"Touch Too Much\\" may not be among the band's best-known songs, but they do rank among their best, and while not every song is equally memorable, there are precious few clunkers here.   This is one of the highlights of AC/DC's career, and one of the highlights of hard rock as well.
B0000CDLA7|5.0|I had never listened to Dream Theater before this, until my cousin gave me a track of Six Degrees of Inner Turbulence, which was &quot;The Glass Prison.&quot;  After hearing that song, I decided to go buy Train of Thought, and I have to say, it is the greatest album I've ever heard.  The thing is, I don't really like their earlier stuff as much as I like this.  I am a metal fan, and this is very hard, with great lyrics, and incredible drums/guitar/bass.  Buy this album....  it's absolutely incredible.
B00008WT5M|5.0|\\"The Razor's Edge\\" is not as well known, or indeed as well liked, as \\"Highway To Hell\\" or \\"Back In Black\\", but it is nevertheless one of AC/DC's very best albums, and certainly their second-best with Brian Johnson.<br />\\"The Razor's Edge\\" rose to #2 on the Billboard 200, and produced three top 20 rock singles, the menacing \\"Thunderstruck\\", the formulaic but fun \\"Are You Ready\\", and the catchy, anthemic \\"Moneytalks\\". And the rest is great as well, all crunchy power chords, big riffs, big hooks, big, dumb, testosterone-powered songs. <BR>Brian Johnson sound as good as he ever did, and lesser-known songs like \\"Fire Your Guns\\", \\"If You Dare\\", \\"Shot Of Love\\", and the title track are better than most of the best songs on AC/DC's mediocre mid-80s albums. There are no weak tracks here at all, and if you only ever buy a handful of AC/DC albums, this should definitely be one of them. \\"The Razor's Edge\\" recaptured everything that was great about AC/DC in the 70s and early 80s.
B00004SVID|4.0|Some here are dismissing this album as unnecessary, but I'm joining the one's who say that this is the definitive version of The Wall on the market. Until Roger Waters releases a DVD of The Wall Live (the tapes are there!) then this is the best way to experience this legendary album. Firstly, the music has much more of an edge to it, making it sound much better than the somewhat contrived (and arguably overly produced) studio version. Secondly, the forementioned studio version had to be toned down for length reasons, while this album lets it all hang out, and to be exact it is 24 minutes longer overall than the original version. Not only are there are a couple of extra tracks which were cut from the studio version, but the stronger songs on The Wall have been fleshed out much better and what results is a much superior listening experience. One of the main complaints with the original was that besides a few good songs, the album wasn't full of great, fleshed out music (cramming 26 tracks into about 60 minutes). Mother, Comfortably Numb and Run Like Hell are all upwards of 7 minutes here while Another Brick, Pt 2 is more than 2 minutes longer than the original. There isn't much interaction between the band and the crowd (most will know why though- it's part of the theme of the music here), however Roger's rant at the start of Run Like Hell is interesting and there are a few p.a. announcements throughout which add to the live experience. The crowd is decent here but that doesn't really matter the same as an arena rock band like Kiss which feeds off the crowd for their energy. You're probably either one who dismisses Floyd as self-indulgent stoner music, or you're a fan. If you fall into the later category then you'll enjoy this.<br />Whether you get this version or the other version with the hardcover booklet, you're still getting the same content (linear notes wise). The other version is just the booklet spread into two in paperback form. Either way the booklet is huge and it's a great insight into the project (especially the concert tour) as well as lots of cool pictures of The Wall in concert for those of us who never experienced it.<br />This is more than just The Wall in a live setting- there are more tracks, and the standard ones are longer and sound much better. Any real Pink Floyd fan, or fan of The Wall will enjoy this, and if you're just getting into Pink Floyd you may as well get this one instead of the original. Until the original Wall is remastered and brought out on SACD along with the studio versions of the songs which were originally cut then this will be the definitive Wall experience. I've got this sitting next to the original at home and I hardly ever play that one anymore.
0142004235|5.0|John Steinbeck is one of the greatest North American writers ever. With his work he was to create a huge portrait of the life in the first half of the 20th Century in United States of America. East of Eden is among his masterpieces, in which he is capable of bringing to life real and vivid characters, influenced by their habitat.<br />The novel follows the life of a family, concentrating on its two offspring since before their birth. Steinbeck also inserted his own family and himself in the book as minor characters and this device sort of gives him authority to talk about the events and people.<br />Not many writers were able to draw such a convincing portrait of such people. By choosing the right words and building the right sentences, the author gave depth and beauty to his novel, so filled with descriptions.<br />East of Eden has survived for decades and praised as one of the most perfect North American novels ever. All this due to Steinbeck geniality. Despite his labored prose this book is not difficult to read and understand. Its reading flows easily and from the beginning the story captures ones attention.<br />Nevertheless East of Eden is not for everyone. Many readers may not connect with the prose and the story. People who usually read contemporary fiction with dubious quality should stay away from any Steinbecks novel, and not to read it only to appear to be highbrow.
B00005JME0|4.0|\\"The Butterfly Effect\\" was a great film despite it's negative reviews from reviewers in the newspapers and such.Ashton Kutcher whose performance people have insulted alot did a pretty good job in the film although he's no where near Oscar nominations.<BR>But the film is about Alex Treborne(Kutcher) whose childwood was severley damaged and now an A student in college he begins to read his childhood journals in an attempt to recreate the the childhood all in the hopes of saving his girlfriend Kaylie (Amy Smart).The flashbacks are very interesting getting you hooked on the story right away and the characters are well casted with Kutcher perfectly fit for the role.Also smaller characters are great too such as a kiddie pornographer played by Eric Stoltz.<BR>The film was very entertaining from the first frame to fade out and was worth the six dollars and fifty cents it cost to get in.<BR>Go see this film,you are not wasting your money.But another thing I should bring up is the fact that this is not really what you would call a horror film,it is more of a drama but it will be likeable for horror freaks.B+ for the movie,B for the acting.<BR>Enjoy!!!
B00005OAE6|5.0|Bob Seger, the unsung hero of American rock and roll, who is finaly being let into the rock and roll hall of fam eafter all this time made one of the greatest albums in rock history with Stranger In Town. Many conceder this to be Bob Seger greatest album but I on the other hand think that title goes to Night Moves, but thats just me. This is a much more lush-album with keyboards and more even softer ballads.<br />The album starts of with one of Bob's biggest hits and one of his all time best songs 'Hollywood Nights' its a great up tempo rocker, and has a warm summer feel to the song. 'Still The Same' is one of my all time favorite songs, its a really great ballad, deffinatly one of Segers best ballads. 'Ol Time Rock And Roll' what can I say its the theme song to me life. 'Till It Shines' is one of Bob's more underrated songs and I think it is actualy one of his best. 'Feel Like A Number' one of my all time favorite songs and my favorite on the album, when ever I hear it, it reminds me of my father because he is a Truck driver and thats what the song is about. 'Aint Got Know Money' is all right but nothing to special there. 'We've Got Tonite' is a great ballad that always reminds me of my parents. 'Brave Strangers' and 'The Famous Final Scene' are both great rock songs, and are a perfect way to end the album.<br />Stranger In Town, is one of the greatest albums of all time, and in my openion Bob Seger's second best, right behind Night Moves. If you like good American rock and roll then you will love Bob Seger and this album.
B000089RVX|4.0|I saw the &quot;new&quot; Evanescence in concert last night and while listening to &quot;Fallen&quot; on the way home came up with the following deep thoughts:<br />First, if you see Evanescence in concert you are going to discover that the performance of most of these songs on stage are rather significantly different from what you have been listening to on the album.  There are lots of ways of characterizing this difference (e.g., the album is chamber pop but on stage it is Goth metal), but it is rather substantial and is due to more than simply adding another heavy metal guitar into the mix.<br />Second, to state the most obvious point, Amy Lee has a voice.  I would say one in a million in terms of people living in this country but I am leaning towards making the odds one in ten million.  Before last night there had been three times at a concert when I got a chill listening to somebody sing (Jewel doing &quot;Foolish Games,&quot; Sarah McLachlan's a capella version of &quot;Fear&quot; and McLachlan and Paula Cole's duet of &quot;Elsewhere) and Amy Lee got me twice with &quot;Going Under&quot; and, of course, &quot;My Immortal&quot; (which starts on the piano and ends with a heavy metal finish in concert).  Whether she is soaring over power chords or a piano ballad it is something to hear.<br />Third, although &quot;Fallen&quot; has some great songs it is not a great album, which is actually a good thing.  &quot;Bring Me to Life&quot; and &quot;My Immortal&quot; have gotten the biggest boosts from the prominent and perfect ways in which they were placed in the &quot;Daredevil&quot; film, but I think &quot;Going Under&quot; is a close third.  &quot;Tourniquet&quot; is a fairly simply song compared to some of the rest, which helps it to stand out from the other tracks on the album.  But there are a few tracks that do pale in comparison to the album's high points.<br />The idea that this is only a &quot;good&quot; album is good news for Evanescence because there is room to improve.  Yes, they won the Grammy for Best New Artist, but I still remember the Starland Vocal Band and Debby Boone in the whatever happened to category, so I take such wins with a grain of salt.  Could Hootie &amp; the Blowfish top the success of their first album?  That was a great album and it was all down hill from there.  Go look at your music collection and see how many groups had a great first album and then never got even close the rest of their career (e.g., Bad Company).  Having a great second album is a lot harder than having a great first album, but despite the success of &quot;Fallen&quot; the opportunity for improvement is definitely there.<br />Of course now there are all the song writing concerns about Evanescence since Ben Moody left and was replaced by Terry Balsamo, formerly the guitarist from Cold.  The success of this group depends on that next album and my biggest concern is not what the songs will be but that they are probably going to be more like the heavy metal I saw in concert last night than the piano ballades that stand out on the album.  If I had to make a bet it would be that the next Evanescence album is not going to go platinum twice let along four times like &quot;Fallen.&quot;  But I have little doubt that Amy Lee is going to be making records one way or another for the next couple of decades.s room to improve.

B000001DQI|5.0|Im not what you would call a Elton John fan, I dont really listen to this kind of music. I like my music to have more of a harder edge. I only own this and greatest hits one. But I most say this is a five star album in all of its glory.<br />Everything you heard about this album is true, well all the good stuff at least. I mean Listen if a guy who listens to primaraly bands like Aerosmith, Metallica, AC/DC, and Black Sabbath likes this album it must be really damn good. All the songs are good, there isnt a bad or weak track. Elton John wrote some very good songs for this album! I cant say this is his best becaus eit is the only album of his I own, but I can say that anyone that buys this album wount be let down.<br />For me this is a guilty pleasure, I know for like 90% of you its the complete opposite, and like I said I cant say this is his best because I only own this album, but I can say I would choose this over anything Billy Joel ever made. Because from what I can tell, Elton is the real Piano man.
B0000AZJXQ|4.0|I love the CD, but for some reason the live versions of the 13th Step songs have a different character live, it's almost like the songs truly come alive out on the road.

B00000612P|5.0|Rod Stewart made a few really good rock and roll albums, and Every Picture Tells a Story is the best of those albums. Rod made some solid albums before this but this was his strongest album to this point and really it was the strongest and most concistant of his whole carear. He never made an album better then this.<br />The Title track is maybe the hardest rocking song in Rods whole carear. Its got great vocals and amazing guitar by none other then Ronnie Wood of course. 'Seems Like A Long Time' and 'Thats Alright' are classic Stewart. 'Tomorrow Is A Long Time' isnt anything that special, its the only weak moment on Every Picture Tells A Story. 'Maggie Maye' Rods signature song, this is one of the greatest songs in rock histroy! 'Mandolin Wind' also is one of Rods best songs, and one of my personal favorites, and noone can play the mandolin like old Ronnie Wood! '(I Know) I'm Losing You' is one of Rod Stewarts best songs, and definatly his best cover song by far! 'Find A Reason To Beleave' is the perfect song to close the album as it to was one of Rods biggest and best songs!<br />This is one of the three essential-must own album by Rod Stewart, he and Ronnie Wood never sounded better together, except when they played with Jeff Beck!
B000063DFQ|5.0|What is there to say about Iron Maiden? First of all, you could take the incredible fast paced guitars, and destructive drums, and put them together to create the powerful force which is Iron Maiden. I first bought this album when I started to discover the better music. The music that counters all the lame crap we see on television. When I bought it, I found myself being hooked. Out went the Disturbed and in came the real metal. All that followed was Tool, Opeth, Emperor, anything you can think of. I'm getting of subject though. Iron Maiden's Piece of Mind is an excellent work of musicianship. The metal on this album is some of the best around. These guys can play! With the raging guitars going a mile a minute, this album certainly is quite a treat. Futures such greats as &quot;The Trooper&quot;. This album will satisfy. Buy it!

The only thing Timberlake will ever be known for is the Janet Jackson debacle. And yes I am old and proud of it...music from the 60s and 70s was way better than the junk that passes for music these days. Spears &amp; Aguilera have no talent except for taking their clothes off, but musically, forget it. YES rules!!!!
B0001AP12G|5.0|This is the best album since Talib Kweli's &quot;Quality&quot;. Every song is unique and Kanye has his own signature style. &quot;We Don't Care&quot; kicks off the album beautifully, and from then, a classic unfolds. Violins played by the Israeli violinist Miri Ben Ari, the album has a lot of musical gener's combined and coverted to Hip Hop context. &quot;All Falls Down&quot; (Previously known as 'All Comes Down w/ Lauren Hill' to the mixtape fellas) is one of the albums many highlights. Then is my favorite track of the album &quot;Spaceship&quot; which is creative, original, and funny. &quot;Jesus Walks&quot; is a great track with a positive message about God. &quot;Never Let Me Down&quot; has 2 verses by Jay-Z, but for some reason, Kanye's verse is the best verse for me. The beat is fire, like all of the tracks, and there is a councious message in Kanye's verse, while Jay-Z does his usual bragging about himself (I still love Jigga). &quot;Get Em High&quot; features Talib Kweli and Common Sense. Now, Kanye spits ill, but Common's verse is probably the best verse I've heard in the last year. Amazing rhyme patterns and it seems as if he's dissing Lil Jon (Illerate Ni**a with a pimp cup), Talib's verse is funny. After that is another one of my favorites &quot;The New Workout Plan&quot; which has funny lyrics and one of the best muiscal arrangment I've ever heard in Hip Hop. Then comes the album's weakest track &quot;Breath In Breath Out&quot; featuring Ludacris on the hook. Most of the skits are funny. Then is &quot;School Spirit&quot; which has an ill beat and Kanye just rips this joint up! But for some reason this song was edited. &quot;2 Words&quot; has my man Mos Def and Freeway on it, it's just ban-anas! crazy. The beat, the lyrics, the hook, the quoire, the violines...&quot;Through The Wire&quot; is a great track about Kanye's nearly fatal car crash and how his mouth was wired shut. I'm sure al of you heard that joint by now. &quot;Family Buisness&quot; is fresh, original, creative, and everything that a Hip Hop song should have. The last track on the album is &quot;Last Call&quot; and Kanye rhymes all of his verse, and towards the end he says his story on how his musical career came alive. This song is like 15 minutes. Pretty dope. Overall, this album is one of the best albums I've ever heard. Definatly a classic record.
B00006JL1Z|4.0|It is just so unreal to realize, that we often forget about certain artists in the music industry because they are older. That does seem to be the case with so many acts from the 70's. It still doesn't surprise me, but no matter what people think of music now, there will always be a special place for so much great music out there in so many people and their hearts. That just truly is the case for Fleetwood Mac. They have no doubt, seem to define what survival is absolutely all about. They have encountered substance abuse, and other hazards that would enchant the formula of mass destruction that would never lead a band back together again. The music still leads a lot more than ever.<br />The 2002 Very Best Of Fleetwood Mac is considered as a gem for any fan of the 70's group, or for anybody who is just started to be interested in their groove. The double-disc collection contains 36 great songs that are truly landmarked here, accept without failures including Time from 1995, and earlier records from the 1960's and 70's, but they aren't featured here. The songs are just absolutely geared into greatness. The songs range from upbeat and signature classics like Landslide and Little Lies, to absolute true masterpieces like Gypsy, Don't Stop, Hold Me, and Sara. The album highlights a whole lot, including some great songs like Tusk, and Silver Springs as well. Still, it would also lead into another chapter for Fleetwood Mac. Longtime member, Christie McVie, left the group in the 1990's after their comeback live record, The Dance. That leads into the behind the scenes of Say You Will for 2003, which none of the songs from that record are on it, for people who don't have a computer. Truthfully, Say You Will, didn't do as well as this did, largely because there was no commercial support for that record on radio.<br />It just surprises me that I've just rediscovered Fleetwood Mac for what they truly are. Nevertheless, they've had a fantastic journey for what they've encountered as a group. I still wish that so many people who are onterested in manufactured artists today, can try to celebrate these gems from the past. The Very Best Of Fleetwood Mac is a absolute must have.as a group. I still wish that so many people who are onterested in manufactured artists today, can try to celebrate these gems from the past. The Very Best Of Fleetwood Mac is a absolute must have.
B000000OYN|5.0|This is very bluesy,soulful,and rockin cd. Anyone who likes the WHITESNAKE sound of the late 80's  and early 90's are in for a surprise because this cd is just plain hard edged rock and roll. This isn't 80's hair band this is DEEP PURPLE,ROLLING STONES AND AC/DC WRAP INTO ONE. A VERY GOOD CD.
B000089RVX|4.0|Of course I had heard of &quot;Bring Me To Life&quot; and &quot;Going Under&quot; a long time ago...but I'd never REALLY REALLY got interested in Evanescence until I heard the astonishingly beautiful ballad I have come to know as &quot;My Immortal.&quot;  You can feel the agony, the anguish, and every emotion that unfolds in that song.  After all, that's what good artists have the ability to do.  So onto this album as a whole.<br />I got this album yesterday for my 17th birthday and it is just phenomenal.  Don't listen to all the negativity about Evanescence being posers and not true music.  They are otherworldly talented lyricists and not so shabby at playing instruments and singing.  The only complaint I would have is one that several of my friends warned me about:  most of the songs sound, well, too similar.  However, the lyrics are incredible; some bringing me to tears, some making me extraordinarily happy.<br />I recommend this album to anyone who likes real music, good lyrics, and Linkin Park.
0142001104|5.0|The &quot;Art of Possibility&quot; deeply resonated with me. Creating value by managing risk and uncertainty has been the core of my life's journey. It has been filled with complexity, tension, and dissonance...but it has also been filled with the discovery of possibility and meaning. The Zanders have done a real service in framing the &quot;how&quot; of possibility with their examples and practices.<br />This gem of a book will be useful not only in managing one's life, but also in helping other's to create their great life stories. The answers to core questions like &quot;which game of success will I choose to play?&quot;,&quot;will I choose to be a contribution?&quot;, and &quot;do I take myself too ___seriously?&quot; are keys to a life of joy, meaning, and fulfillment.<br />Can you see the work of art within you? Within others? Or are you focusing on the facade? Who is winning the battle between the caculating self and the central self? Are you vulnerable or are you permeable? What is here now? And what do you want to do from here? Get yourself this book and engage in THE joyous adventure of opening up to your possibilities.
B00006ZXSK|4.0|Ever After is one of my favorite films. I saw it when it came out and I've just watched the DVD. It tells the Cinderella story in a new way. This Cinderella is gutsier, braver and more believable than the classic story book story would have us think. She knows about equality and independence and she's outspoken. Her Prince Charming is really cute, too! Angelica Huston's Wicked Stepmother is a lot of fun, though the viewer wants to protect Cinderella from her. I highly recommend this movie.
B00005JMJ4|5.0|i will start off by saying, i absolutely loved this movie.  that being said i will leave a disclaimer...this movie is not, i repeat, NOT for everyone.  this is a movie that revolves around two people who find themselves in japan for different reasons.  this movie is first and foremost a character study.  it has funny parts, it has dramatic parts, but mainly it is a look into the life of two people.<br />that having been said, if you like rich and vivid characters you may find yourself liking this movie.  bill murray plays an aging actor who finds himself in japan filming a commercial for whiskey (something we find him drinking often!).  scarlett johansson plays a character who travels to japan with her husband.  we find her character wandering japan quite a bit as her husband (brilliantly played by giovanni ribisi) is a very busy photographer.<br />both johansson and murray are absolutely great in this film.  they play the characters with a passion that is rarely seen in films (at least in my humble opinion) today.  we have seen flashes of greatness from murray (ex. rushmore) but he has never been as on top of his game as he is here.  and although johansson is basically a newcomer, she plays the part with a style and grace rarely found in actresses of her age.<br />again, i will note that this is not a movie that everyone will enjoy, in fact most people will probably be bored by it.  but, if you are looking for two outstanding performances, and a movie that hits character development full on, then watch soffia copola's &quot;lost in translation!&quot;
0060989157|5.0|Buy it, even if you are not a Motley Crue or a hard rock fan coz this is pure R N Roll!!!!!!<BR>No other books has shown me so far what white american trash really means.<BR>If I was a movie producer,  would get the rights straight away. I read this book in one day, it is so intense. Buy it you will not regret it !!!!!
0385504209|2.0|Which is why I bought this book. It does have a strong start, and at first, I thought that it was going to be very good. But, the self-conscious writing style, the short chapters (which give the book a newspaper feel), the annoying habit the author has of obviously withholding information, and the awkward dialogue combine to make this a very tedious read. In fact, I lost interest about halfway through.....just about the time my plane was ready to board.<br />If you're curious about this book, wait for the paperback.
B000002JS0|4.0|In my opinion this is not 1 of ac/dc's best albums but pretty damn good for a debut it gave the world a taste of what would become one of the biggest hard rock bands in the world if your an ac/dc fan you gotta have this album.
0783116934|3.0|CITIZEN X     (USA - 1995)    Aspect ratio: 1.33:1  TV soundtrack: Dolby Stereo    Based on a true story: In 1980's Russia, a low-paid forensics expert (Stephen Rea) struggles against the paranoia and bureaucracy of his Communist bosses during the search for serial killer Andrei Chikatilo (Jeffrey DeMunn), who has tortured, killed and cannibalized dozens of young people and children over a period of eight years.    Anchored by Rea's committed performance as the dogged pathologist-cum-detective who risked his reputation and livelihood in pursuit of Russia's most prolific mass murderer, TV movie CITIZEN X (a conflation of events outlined in Robert Cullen's book 'The Killer Department') points the finger of blame at an unyielding political system which allowed a monster to operate virtually unhindered for almost a decade. Veteran Brit actor Joss Ackland essays the role of a hardline Communist official whose allegiance to the State proves the single biggest obstacle to the apprehension of Chikatilo, while Donald Sutherland suffers manfully as the only high-ranking officer prepared to assist Rea's investigation, at great personal sacrifice.     Writer-director Chris Gerolmo's bleak but compelling film marshals a wealth of information, conveyed for the most part through dialogue rather than action, as the body count rises and the authorities struggle to hide their secrets from the outside world. Crucially, Chikatilo is portrayed as a desperate man, trapped in appalling social conditions (he's regularly humiliated by workmates and lives with a shrewish, loveless wife), whose repressed emotions and psychopathic tendencies find expression in appalling acts of violence (depicted mostly in long shot, with the worst mutilations occurring off-screen).     While the tone is generally grim, Gerolmo can't resist lightening the climax with typical Hollywood fripperies (cf. Rea's unlikely 'confrontation' with an angry crowd whose loved ones were murdered by Chikatilo), but that's atiny lapse in an otherwise laudable production, which includes Max von Sydow in a small, but pivotal, cameo role. Technical credits are professional throughout, and performances are uniformly excellent.
0345457684|4.0|Mr. Morgan surprised me with the quality of his language, depth of character development, and off-handed technical understanding.  To explain this last item, I've found that many new SF writers get overexcited by the wonders of whatever world they are exploring.  For &quot;Altered Carbon&quot;'s characters, the technology that 2004's most powerful people would beg for is as widely-understood and understated as microwave ovens.<br />A note of caution to timid and/or young readers: this book gets very precisely violent at least a dozen times and very sensuous at least five.  Murder, war, rape, corruption, and rotted love are the grit of the story, and double(and triple)speak is common.  The lies and colorations of the dialogue is sometimes difficult to follow, as there are more than twenty major characters (i.e. with at least a page of dialogue and a wish to kill the narrator at one time or another :) ).<br />Perhaps another note of caution is the constant reminder of the narrator's status as an intelligent soldier - there is a great deal of musing and reciting from warrior doctrine.  If you were annoyed by the &quot;propaganda&quot; in &quot;Starship Troopers&quot;, your patience will be severely tested by &quot;Altered Carbon&quot;.<br />The narrator, Takeshi Kovacs, is a James Bond without the dashing good looks or tact.  His training (and former job) was Envoy of the United Nations, a doublespeak word for exterminator/guerilla/ninja.  Since actually sending an army through space is not feasible for timing reasons (I believe the idea was &quot;they'd get there in time to interrogate the rebel's grandchildren&quot;), the U.N.'s armies are conveyed digitally over near-instantaneous communications and placed inside dormant bodies to fight insurgents.  Criminals' minds are put into storage, and their original bodies are often put to good use reviving those whose bodies have died.  The basis of all of this is the &quot;stack&quot;, a small, armored piece of diamondoid circuitry that records the states of the brain it's implanted in. &lt;ah!  So that's why this is in the science fiction section&gt;  The narrator (and most of the rest of the characters) have switched bodies often enough to call them &quot;sleeves&quot;.  Takeshi is hired in the first chapter to find the killer of a very powerful man on Earth.<br />This is a detective story, and if you like detective stories (like me) you just might read all 300-odd pages in 22 hours.  The &quot;truth&quot; revealed at the end is a superb summation of the evils that can accumulate in a world where it's difficult to die.<br />One obvious editing problem appeared: a name appeared in the last chapter which hadn't been used before; it referred to a victim who had several names already for business reasons.  Otherwise, characters grew like wild roses : in bursts whenever you're not looking.<br />Overall, this book is an excellent read and a worthy volume to go beside my Gibson and Niven.  Mr. Morgan hasn't reached Asimov status in my eyes yet, but the next book is due 2 March, and I can't wait.

0739313126|4.0|One thing is absolutely certain Dan Brown can write!! Whether or not his plot is completely feasible or his research can be supported his prose is artful and all of his characters, even those that play minor roles, are well developed. While I personally believe that a millennia old secret society would have a better system than to rely on the security of the secret identities of its four top members, this premise leads to an enlightening and suspenseful tale. Having previously researched in depth the role the church played in the subjugation of women I know that much of Brown's evidence is legitimate. However, his casting of all pagan's as egalitarian is a stretch, misogyny was evident long before monotheism. And he has woven the fact together with his fiction so well that it is impossible to see where one begins and one ends if any of his evidence is in fact his own brainchild. While a bibliography can be found at [...] I would have appreciated a clear outline of what was supported and what was fantasy. In that regard it is a torment to the intellectual mind. Paul Michael does an excellent job as the reader of the book. His voices are specific, and his interpretation of Silas is particularly heart wrenching. Worth a read or a listen.
B0000WN0ZK|5.0|The new DVD (released 2-17-04) is flawlessly restored, very clear and bright with not a hint of dirt in the print.  Even the audio appears to have been cleaned up and restored.  Hard to believe, watching it, that it's almost 40 years old; it looks brand new.<br />Of course no comment needs be made about the film itself -- it deserves every accolade garnered in its long life.  The nature of observation, perception and reality, layers of meaning within meaning... it's all here for discovery.<br />One could have hoped for a bit more in the extras, however.  What we get are two threadbare theatrical trailers and an absolutely braindead &quot;commentary&quot; by some halfwit critic, who completely misses the poetry, whimsy and most of the symbolism of the film.  In fact, his self-important babbling threatens to ruin the whole presentation, so I recommend you avoid it altogether.  With as much analysis, speculation and adulation as this film has gathered over the years, I'm sure much better extras could have been included.<br />And the packaging here is painfully cheap....<br />But no mind, the film itself rises above all the negatives (pun intended).
B00006JLX4|3.0|Everyone wants to praise this album, but this is in fact, not as original sounding as some of the later Pavement albums. This album sounds like The Fall - lite. Every idea on display on this record was directly stolen from Mark E. Smith, a man with more talent in his pinky than SM and SS combined. The sound of this album is pretty enjoyable, after all it sounds like a lost Fall album. As for another reviewer who said that Pixies and Sonic Youth records haven't held up over time....hunh? Both of those bands in their prime were also much better than Pavement...especially The Pixies.
B0001I562I|5.0|When our family first saw this movie,it set up a lot off long didcussions at the dinner table,about what such an event would be like for our sons,and us,of course as parents we could see the down side to having our sons kidnapped and not brought back for eight years! You have to hand it to the younger generation they only saw the adventure and I have to admit their enthusiasum really over came our reservations! I'ts a great movie to be watched with the family(in case there are any questions)and then just turn them loose to watch it when they want,let them have there dreams that allow them to reach out much further in life and accomplish anything (if) they want it bad enough! I know I didn't give away the plot, but in this case I know first hand that telling the plot to a child will only ruin it for them! They will thank you more for the suprises! I can say this from years of raising our children and now I'm buying it for my Grandchildren. Thank you very much for rereleasing it! Thank you.
B000002GB9|5.0|this album is great. all of the songs on this album are great. the best songs on this album are the grand illusion, come sail away and castle waltz. i recomend this great album.
B000000OAH|4.0|Jazz has some of Queen's very best efforts: the remarkably upbeat \\"Don't stop me now,\\" the winsome folk rock of \\"Leaving home ain't easy,\\" and the typically great Deacon pop-rocker \\"If you can't beat 'em,\\" but also some real clinkers like the poorly structured \\"Bicycle Race,\\" and the obnoxious \\"Let me entertain you.\\" A mixed bag, but it's Queen, so there is always more going than most bands can squeeze out of an entire career.
B00006879E|5.0|Since M5 is a local band, I've known about them for more than a year.  I first picked up their CD last May and it's the most listened to CD I have.  I can't tell you how great this band is; they are amazing in concert, their energy is just contagious and they make me want to get out of my seat and dance around.  They're great for playing in the car or sitting at home doing work.  It's difficult to compare them to anyone b/c there's no other band like M5, but just trust me...you want this CD!
B00008J4P5|4.0|It wasn't the greatest thing I have ever heard, but it was good nonetheless. Jack White is a really good musician and Meg White Seems to tag along and keep the beat straight, but the cd just lacks the right amount of good songs leaving the cd sounding rushed. OK well I have the courtesy of leaving personal reviews about every song.<br />Seven Nation Army: The pretty much only hit of the cd but having a fun sound to it it is a very good sound but good quite boring after continous listening. 9/10<br />Black Math: A fun song and a fast track and really loud. good, just good. 8/10<br />There's No Home For You Here: Yawn, very boring, I don't really know what to say about this one. 5/10<br />I Just Don't Know What To Do With Myself: A love this song, probably my favorite. 10/10<br />In the cold, cold night: Meg White sings this song so its kind of slow plus she can't sing. 5/10<br />I Want To Be The Boy To Warm Your Mother's Heart: This song is so lame im literally speechless. Wonder where he came up with this one. 4/10<br />You've Got Her In Your Pocket: Stupid, the songs are getting lamer by the minute. 5/10<br />Ball And Biscuit: Luckily the last crap song. But For How long? 5/10<BR>The Hardest Button To Button: The only other hit on the cd and a very neat song but lacks in lyric perfection. &quot;I have a backyard with nothin' in it, except a stick, a dog, and a box with somethin' in it&quot; What is that? Still... 10/10<br />Little Acorns: The beginning is boring but after the beginning it is a cool song. The riff is good to. 9/10<br />Hypnotize: Short, Sweet, and a fast song. Thumbs up! 9/10<br />The Air Near My Fingers: Sounds like one of Ozzy Osbourne's songs but that won't help the song's grade. Kind of boring. 7/10<br />Girl, You Have No Faith In Medicine: Great song, should of been a hit. Sounds like a classic if you ask me. 9/10<br />Well It's True That We Love One Another: Crap, its like a musical type of I love Meg and my cousin, yay!!! Really mushy and stupid, Not what I paid for. 2/10<br />Well after all of the songs calculated up I would have to rate this cd a...OverAll 7/10
B00008NV4I|5.0|I happened to like this movie a fair bit (maybe not five stars but I'm doing that just to irritate the one star complainers.)  TNG was a heck of a lot better than TOS and the this plot was similar to Wrath of Khan but unique as well.  I hope Paramount decides to make new Trek movies based on DS9 and Voyager.  The story in Nemesis was an appropriate send off for TNG and leaves the way open for future movies, etc.  The only thing that ticked me off was Worf.  Leave him on QonoS from now on.  Nemesis had an interesting idea (Shinzon as Picards clone) but perhaps would have been even better if it had been a Reman.  Who knows?  Hopefully Data will be restored (he always was an intriguing character) but not in the way of Search for Spock and then DS9, the equal of TNG can take over and take Trek even further and better.
B00006LLNU|4.0|After numerous spins of this disc I am quite moved. It does a bit remind me of Radiohead, but more abstract, and nowhere near radio friendly. Something good to wind down, or spaceout to. Nice soothing guitar, beautiful piano, and overall pretty dreamy. Not sure what he is singing in, I assume Icelandic? Fans of space-rock and shoegazers should dig it. There is a video on youtube of track 2 I think that is really beautiful and disturbing at the same time. School kids playing outside, etc., you'll see it.
0553579908|5.0|All these books are great. Never read anything near so believable or real-worldy descriptive.. they are full of life, of eating & drinking & fighting & wenching.. I could easily be one of these sellswords or lords and that's what makes you get into a story, is its believability and identifiablity on the part of the reader. It is like Braveheart & LOTR mixed together. Characters act like real people in these books. They all (well most all) have a conscience, they have fears and hates and lusts just like you & I. On a whim (not much of a fiction reader) I borrowed the 1st from a coworker and quickly read thru the series, not realizing there have been yearlong or more waits between each of these books, so I am left sitting here like a fantastic movie has just quit playing before the finish, leaving me hanging & wanting more. C'mon, make with Book Four already, I'm dyin here.<br />I'm not going to mention any overt spoilers about this book, but there are some elements that had me feeling deja vu until I realized these things in the story had occurred in real life. The seige of King's Landing is basically the real-world yearlong seige of Constantinople by Muslims in 717, from the great chain idea to the napalm-like wildfire (Greek fire historically) flung from missile engines (Martin's Three .....) in frangible clay pots. Swollen refugee population in King's Landing = swollen refugee population in Constantinople as people fled before the invasion. Religious fanatics under King Stannis = Religious fanatics under Maslama & other muslim caliphs. Both suffered heavy desertions in the battle, while starvation to the point of cannibalism is in there too. When you realize the similarities, what seemed like such great originality and creative strategic battle sequences turns out to just be lifted from the history books.<br />This is not to discount Martin as all his characters, their interplay, their dialogue, all is from him and nothing is to be faulted. I actually enjoyed having to look up some of his olde words, it proves he does his research and only helps add to the realism and timeliness of the world he's created.<br />The only recurring sidestory in all the books I personally didn't care a whole lot for was the Daenerys thread.. it was hard to care about her and believe her wise actions seeing as she was a meek 14yr old who suddenly, inexplicably started acting twice her age. Rereading the series I skipped past these passages. The immense forces of Dothraki horselords are basically Huns or Mongol hordes, living & dying on thier horses, eating horseflesh & drinking mare's milk, living a life of complete savagery and constant hardship. But just when you think the story is only a fictional Middle-Ages Earth with different names, all the true fantasy stuff comes in and makes it engrossing all over again. The things happing up North are awesome and I can't wait to see what happens in Book Four. Do yourself a favor and read this story. Long live Tyrion!

B00018D44U|5.0|Norah Jones sophomore effort is a continuation of its predecessor. A loose blend of jazz, folk and country, coupled with her clear, almost breathy vocals. Right from the beautiful surreal cover art, you know you're in for a treat.<br />`Sunrise', the lead off single, opens the cd to good effect. It's a light, breezy song.<br />`Carnival town' is an excellent cabaret style number, one of 6 songs penned or co penned by Jones.<br />`In the morning' is another beauty, with some great bass playing.<br />`Humble me' is a beautiful song of contrition and forgiveness, almost Gospel like.<br />`Above ground', The long way home' (with delightful guitar strumming), The prettiest thing' (very pretty song), and `Don't miss you at all' (a tender piano ballad which samples Duke Ellington to good effect), are other standouts from this stark, understated gem.<br />This cd will do your collection no harm.

0743243307|2.0|I honestly don't get it. As another reviewer suggested, this writer is just the luckiest girl alive....she's riding a hot wave of interest in ethnic fiction, and the Bangladesh/London setting is what must have sold this book. It can't be the writing. This is one of the most painfully boring and slow moving stories that I have read. The opening is quite good, but from there it just fizzles. We know far too much of her old husband Chandu and his weird habit of playing with his stomach. She repeats things endlessly in this book. The letters from the sister are also painful to read, and as someone else mentioned for some unknown reason they are in broken english, which makes zero sense. The letter would have been written in their native tongue, and unless the sister has dyslexia or is completely illiterate, it just make no sense to have her writing be so bad.<br />This book is just so easy to put down. It amazes me that for all the really good books out there, this one is garnering so much unwarranted attention.
B00005JMJ4|2.0|Let me start by saying I love Bill Murray and I thought he did an excellent job in a REALLY SLOW movie.  Perhaps the filmmaker was trying to show us how boring and sad some people's lives are, if that was the intent, then the film was a success.  I kept waiting on something interesting or exciting to happen, and before I knew it the film was over.  If you are really bored, and want to see a film about someone's life that is worst than yours, then this is your movie.
B00005JKGZ|5.0|One of the greats...I read somewhere (don't remember where)that Vincent Minnelli called \\"time\\" the real antagonist in this seemingly benign musical.  The things that time has the power to take away from all of us is what makes the movie so poignant.  This underlying theme makes the movie timeless and so beautiful. I can't wait to see what the DVD looks and sounds like.  DVD was made for movies like this.
6304711905|5.0|Aside from Clint Eastwood's \\"Unforgiven\\" & \\" Outlaw Josey Wales\\", this is the best western (and certainly the most authentic, as they used actual antique guns, saddles,etc). Val kilmer gives a performance that ranks with Peter O'Toole and Richard Burton. Just buy it! I own one of Val's pistols and knife from the film, acquired from the company owner who supplied it ( and also played Texas Jack Vermilion ((Peter Sherayko)). If i can spend THAT MUCH CASH, you can drop a $20 bill for a treasure. And stop reading all these \\"critics\\". The film is historically acurate save the shortening of time between events. Self proclaimed Earp experts insist that Doc could not have killed Ringo , as Doc was in another state. I saw, in earp's own hand (in a letter to a friend), that false papers were made to make people think doc was somewhere else. doc killed ringo, then turned ringo's gun belt upside down......typical holliday humor.  Enough history. Enjoy the film and be prepared for kilmer to blow you away!
B00005JLH3|1.0|I think most of the gushing reviewers here are in love with the &quot;concept&quot; of this film.  I love southern colleges and the halftime experience too, but this movie is poorly made.  Too cliche, too predictable, and overall just a simple product.  However, until a good movie is made regarding this topic; line up and join the masses that seem to be &quot;falling over themselves&quot; about this movie based on the idea of the story.
B000089RVR|4.0|I bought this disc for my girlfriend as a Christmas gift and didn't think I would really enjoy it seeing as how I'm not a huge fan of her previous work. I have to admit however, that its really grown on me. Although not perfect, it's a good listen none the less. Great production and solid songwriting. A bit more poppy than what I usually listen to but a nice change of pace.
B00007G207|4.0|Tender tale about a kid, and the way the local Movie house influences him and people around him in post World War Two. Giuseppe Tornatore creates an atmosphere full of love and nostalgia that fully brings out the way cinema really touches our life. I love the priest who censors the movie a head of time with the sound of his bell when he finds something objectionable in a movie. Reminds me of the people we have in our government today.
B00011V8CW|5.0|An outstanding album by the Chameleon himself. This album is a MUST by Bowie  fans and a must by music fans! This new age neo jazz funk rock CD is simpely amazing. If you can afford it....then go get it!<BR>5 Stats for the album<BR>5 Stars for the dvd<BR>2/12 stars for Bonus disc<BR>0 stars for price!
0156027321|3.0|Martel weaves an intriguing story of survival and faith in clean, skillful prose. A decidedly enjoyable read, with moments of wonderful humor and insight. And yet, I can't help but feel that the book is a bit overrated. It definitely does not live up to its (somewhat gimmicky and self-congratulatory) promise that it will &quot;make you believe in God.&quot; There is a wink-wink-nudge-nudge self-consciousness to the writing that keeps this book from entering the ranks of magical realism masterpieces by writers like Garcia Marquez or Vonnegut.
B00001OH7P|5.0|Bottom line: If you don't own this album.....then go get it NOW!
0792833201|2.0|Love the cast, love the ideas, but this movie never scared me over twenty years ago when it came out and it definitely doesn't now.  It felt more like an amusement park ride than a horror film.<br />There were rumors at the time of its release that Tobe Hooper had been fired or barely showed up, giving control of the film to Steven Spielberg.  I've never heard any follow up to that, but it's obvious that this movie is more of a Spielberg film (cute kids, harmless thrills, constant tracking shots, etc.) than a Tobe Hooper film (think of the dark, mischevious cynicism of THE TEXAS CHAINSAW MASSACRE).  I don't know.<br />All the whispering scenes drove me nuts.  Did they think the ghosts wouldn't hear them?<br />The \\"experts\\" in the story didn't seem afraid of anything and made the supernatural sound fun and fulfilling.  How can you feel any dread when Beatrice Straight and that crazy little psychic are all giddy?<br />THE EXORCIST makes POLTERGEIST look like an afterschool special on Nick at Nite.
1577311523|5.0|The Power of Now is a terrific book which helps us to understand that running away from the present moment is tantamount to running away from life.  This book moves us toward acceptance of the present moment and life, even if it isn't great.  Being in the now makes us fully present in life.  This book is worth the money for sure. Strongly recommended also is Optimal Thinking: How To Be Your Best Self, a brilliant book for showing us how simple it is to put our best self in charge of our lives and how to make the most of everything that comes our way.
B00005M989|5.0|Let's focus on the songs and music that are presented here. Prince is the champ. Prince is the KING. You cannot get much better than Prince. He is probably my favorite recording artist of all time. His is an amazing lyricist and guitarist, and not to mention vocalist. His hard rock, 80's techno, pop and disco sensabilities are excellent, and all of the tracks presented here represent Prince perfectly. Sure, there are a few great one's missing, but all the songs that ARE here. They are great. My all time favorite Prince tracks are here: Little Red Corvette, Purple Rain, Lets Go Crazy, 1999 - but all of the songs here certainly are great. Flawless. Prince is one of the few GREAT talents out there, and unfortunetly people don't seem to get it and mock him. People, take a look into this music. All the songs are excellent. Excellent, perfect, flawless songs from the master of music, a excellent blend of hard rock, techno, funk and pop. Get it. It will definetly convert you into a Prince fan.
1560100842|5.0|Vey basic book on the principles of animation.  Teaches you basic modeling of characters and some techniques on walks and movement.  Coupled with The Animators Survival Kit, a great way to start learning animation.
B000002NFM|4.0|However, I sagged the star rating a bit because there a few songs where the singing turns into rapping, and I hate rap. But I really like Techno. The beats and hard hitting and groovy, they force you to get up and move. They are very fast as well. The bass, keys and all that other good stuff is excellent. Well constructed, well placed, dark stuff all around. Great rave techno stuff. The technometal songs are pretty good, considering I am not the biggest metal fan in the world. The singing/chanting/talking is interesting, with a few quests sprinkled here and there. All the songs are pretty good, but the best one's would have to be Smack my B!tch Up, Serial Thrilla and without a doubt, the head-bobing 'Firestarter' - the catchies song here. Prodigy have held up after some great albums, and this is another good album. Must have for all ye techno fans.
B00005JMJ4|1.0|ACTUALLY, I BELIEVE IT IS MY DUTY TO WRITE AN ANSWER TO THAT IDIOT WHO GAVE THIS MOVIE 5-STARS, &quot;A PHILOSOPHY STUDENT FROM WHEATON, ILLINOIS&quot;. I JUST WANT TO MAKE SURE THAT WHOEVER READ HIS REVIEW DOES NOT GET THE IMPRESSION THAT &quot;LOST IN TRANSLATION&quot; IS A PHILOSOPHICAL TRIP INTO THE HUMAN SOUL. INSTEAD THIS MOVIE IS A HORRIBLY CONCEIVED AND EXECUTED MOVIE. IT ACTUALLY REMINDED ME OF ALL THOSE MIND-NUMBING RUSSIAN MOVIES I SAW IN CUBA DURING THE '60S (THOSE WERE THE ONLY MOVIES THAT CASTRO ALLOWED INTO THE COUNTRY IN THOSE DAYS, ANYTHING ELSE WOULD HAVE BEING, ACCORDING TO THE COMMUNISTS, &quot;CAPITALISTIC OR IMPERIALISTIC&quot; AND HENCE CORRUPTOR OF THE &quot;PEOPLE'S MIND&quot;). THOSE RUSSIAN MOVIES WERE BAD. I MEAN REAL BAD. I REMEMBER THAT IN ONE SCENE OF A NOW FORGOTTEN MOVIE, I SAW SOMEONE WHO FOR NO REASON AT ALL, WAS LOOKING OUT OF A WINDOW FOR WHAT SEEMED AN ETERNITY. I THOUGHT ABOUT THIS SCENE OVER AND OVER AS I SAT, BORED AND DEPRESSED DESPERATELY TRYING TO CONCENTRATE AT WATCHING THIS EXCUSE FOR A MOVIE, &quot;LOST IN TRANSLATION&quot; TO GET MY MONEY'S WORTH. YES, I ADMIT IT, I WATCHED THIS MOVIE. AFTER ALL, I PAID $3.00 RENTAL - I HAD TO SEE IT TO THE END. BAD MISTAKE, I SHOULD HAVE TURNED IT OFF AFTER THE FIRST 5 MINUTES BECAUSE THE REST OF THE MOVIE IS THE FIRST 5 MINUTES OF THE MOVIE BEING EXTENDED INTO A FULL LENGTH MOVIE. <BR>BUT, BACK TO MY ANSWER TO OUR PHILOSOPHY STUDENT FROM WHEATON, ILLINOIS&quot;: <BR>FIRST OF ALL, IN YOUR REVIEW, INSTEAD OF ASKING US TO EXAMINE OUR PITIFUL LITTLE LIVES, YOU SHOULD HAVE CONCENTRATED ON THE JOB ON HAND: REVIEW THE MOVIE &quot;LOST IN TRANSLATION&quot;. <BR>SECONDLY, YOU WERE NOT HELPING ALL THOSE PEOPLE WHO MAY BE INFLUENCED TO BUYING THIS MOVIE SIMPLY BECAUSE BY READING YOUR PSEUDO-PHILOSOPHICAL MAMBO JUMBO THEY MAY THINK THEY ARE BUYING A &quot;DEEP&quot; AND COMPLEX MOVIE. BOY! WHAT A MISTAKE THAT WOULD BE!<BR>AND THIRD, A BAD MOVIE, IS A BAD MOVIE, IS A BAD MOVIE, THERE IS NO PHILOSOPHIC MANOUVER THAT CAN CHANGE THAT.<BR>... AND IN CONCLUSION: G-E-T -A- L-I-F-E.
0385504209|5.0|Dan Brown writes a mind boggling, intriguing mystery that questions the beliefs of many. The Da Vinci is a must read for those with a open mind to the worlds of religion, art and culture. The Da Vinci Code is a perfect mix of history and a modern murder mystery.<br /> When the curator of the Louvre is found dead the French Judicial Police are on the trail to pin point the murderer. Robert Langdon, an American symbologist is brought into help decipher the curator clues. When Sauniere is found out to be linked with the Priory of Sion, a secret society the matter changes and a treasure hunt around Europe begins.<br /> The Da Vinci Code is written in such a way that advanced vocabulary is not needed. It is an easy, enjoyable read.<br /> The characters are definitely different and each have their own flaws and talents. Their ability to solve the puzzles and link one story to the other is amazing and blows my mind. The characters have a voice of their own and are well developed.<br /> The plot is a bit predictable but the puzzles, clues and mystery aspect of it makes up for the weak plot. In some parts it is confusing but as the book continues the pieces fall together well. The book does have the potential to create a controversy.<br /> The book is like no other I have ever read. The Da Vinci Code stands in a category of its own, setting the bar high for those authors that wish to enter. I believe that The Da Vinci Code will set a trend with books and short stories. I think that The Da Vinci Code will be made into a motion picture in the next few years. Whether or not it would be the best thing depends on the audience. Personally I feel that the book should remain as it is because if it is made into a movie Brown's voice will be lost within the translation from novel to script.<br /> Overall this book has been the best book I have read in a long time. It was refreshing and a wonderful idea. Dan Brown puts together a wonderful masterpiece just as Leonardo Da Vinci and his Mona Lisa. I admire Dan Brown for putting together this wonderful mystery and I encourage all of you to read The Da Vinci Code and experience this story!a. I admire Dan Brown for putting together this wonderful mystery and I encourage all of you to read The Da Vinci Code and experience this story!
B00005LC4B|4.0|Pretty good DVD/movie...its a little boring at the beginning but it gets better.
B00005JMJ4|1.0|Portions of this movie are ideal for illustrating to the folks at home, how lonely and isolating business travel can actually be.  The best of places, in the greatest of locations, are little more than a velvet cage when you are alone for extended periods of time.<br />The problem is that these are experiences you look forward to ending, not bringing into your home for entertainment purposes.  Clearly the finest arts form a visceral connection with our emotions, but for me please, lets not connect with my sense of boredom.  Real life is brimming with opportunities for boredom and isolation.  This is not a plea for pabulum, but for gosh sakes, lets actually entertain.  This is like watching &quot;Empire,&quot; but with people.
B00008H2LB|5.0|I loved Meteora.  I would recommend this CD because I think Linkin Park is unbelievably talented.  I love Faint, From the Inside and Lying from You.  Chester has an amazing voice and I can actually understand what Mike is saying when he raps.  If you liked Hybrid Theory, I would definitely recommend this one.  I would like to request that when someone dislikes a CD, that they give concrete reasons instead of babbling on incessantly about how it is just crap(I really can't believe that someone compared them to the Backstreet Boys!).  Everyone is entitled to their opinion, but at least use a little intelligence when you write your review!
B00009RDGA|5.0|I discovered this funny gem a few years ago and haven't been able to stop watching it.  The humor is subtle and hilarious, the acting superb.  Tatum O'Neal's frank and mature performance as her real-life father's tag-along cohort in crime makes the movie.  If you enjoy tales of lovable con-artists, this is definitely for you.
0385504209|2.0|It is remarkable to me how the success of &quot;The Da Vinci Code&quot; has catapulted Dan Brown's career.  It has caused his previous under read works to hit bestsellerdom years after first being published.  And as a matter of fact, it was based solely on this book's significantly long ride at the top of the New York Times Bestseller list that finally (after nearly a year) convinced me (against my better judgment) to see what all the interest was about.  And to my deep disappointment (not in Dan Brown but rather in the seemingly abhorrent taste in fiction that pervades our culture and has been cemented by pitiful works of fiction such as this one) this novel is little more than a fictional account of some historical research, dragged along for 450+ pages with extremely bad prose, truly one-dimensional characters, and what can only be considered barely plausible action.  If you want to read a good book (one that is actually written well, has good characterization, and a meaningful and plausible plot) then please, please do NOT read &quot;The Da Vinci Code&quot;.
0316666343|5.0|Despite its morbid premise, this book left me feeling uplifted.  This is a tale of a community's response to tragedy, the rape and murder of a beloved teenage girl.  While the aftershock of her disappearance has understandably negative results on her family and neighborhood, the story was crafted in such a way that it ended up as a narrative of hope, not depression.  More importantly, this was one of the better books I read in 2003.  It kept me riveted from the first page.  I would definitely recommend it.
B00005JM02|5.0|I'm a huge fan of Pixar and their work; I think the animation they've done in the past decade or so has been truly revolutionary for the way kids movies are crafted.  There are a lot of &quot;moron&quot; movies that get splashed across the screen every year so that kids will beg their parents to take them to the movies, thus pumping large revenues into the studios.  It's the candy-bar effect: they do nothing for the kid, but they do make the kid make their parent spend money.<br />If those movies are candy-bars, &quot;Finding Nemo&quot; is a full meal complete with veggies.  First off; the animation--it's like a moving art gallery.  Colors are everywhere, they're vibrant, they're full of motion, they absolutely entice, and a joy to watch.  There's not a drab speck in this film, even when the water gets smokey and the scenery is sparse; it's still thrilling to watch the animated ocean, especially how the different shades effect the appearance of the two lead fish; Marlin and Dory.  I especially like the little &quot;neighborhood&quot; that Nemo and Marlin are a part of, with variated corals everywhere, multi-hued fish swimming past, sumptuous undersea fauna, etc etc etc...<br />The comedy; first rate.  And I mean really top-notch.  One thing a lot of kids movies do is assume that their audience will only get the dumbest of jokes.  Kids are sharp and respond to subtle humor, and the writers of &quot;Nemo&quot; know this.  It helps a lot too that you have a seasoned comic actor Albert Brooks and comedienne-actress Ellen Degeneres on board as well (incidentally, I think this role for Degeneres really announces her as a comedy heavyweight, if her show a few years ago didn't.  Perhaps I'm late in catching on :-).  This isn't to say &quot;Nemo&quot; is high-brow humor, but it manages a level that I think is perfect for both kids and adults to laugh at, most of them coming from Dory who's a quirky mix of comedy relief, odd-ball character, and dramatic seat.  With her reststhe majority of the comedy, but also an added element of the satisfaction that comes from her character's resolution.  It seems too that a lot of comedy movies lack a basic silliness; as if they're unable or unwilling to go there, and rely on vollying insults back and forth for two hours.  &quot;Nemo&quot; brings back the silly and it pays off.<br />The movie might be viewed as a little skewed against Australians, as another reviewer has mentioned, but I think this is an innocent quirk of the movie and has nothing to do with trying to slant Australians.  There is a pelican in the movie who is Australian and is not in anyway stupid or bumbling like the Dentist.<br />You'll probably also miss Willem Dafoe voicing Gill, I know I did.  Maybe I wasn't expecting it; but the tank in the Dentist's office is a neat little microcosm of the ocean in terms of learning how to survive, alliances, rights-of-passage, etc.<br />All in all, you can watch it for these different levels, or you can sit back and laugh.  My only gripe with the movie is the beginning which is far too scary for kids (reminds me of Bambi walking around the forest calling out, &quot;Mother!  Mother!&quot;), but if you have the DVD you can skip by this part without missing a beat.
B000066I6N|3.0|With the darkened sun and black bodies disembarking on a distant shore on its cover, this is a theme album about death. The topic appears directly or indirectly in most of its songs. So if you are in the mood for something of that nature you will probably enjoy this. It is quite a valid artistic attempt in my opinion although some of the songs do plod along like a funeral march and Plants vocals are so whispery and croaky in places it sounds like someone singing from their death bed, perhaps this was done on purpose to increase the effect. The music is mainly a sort of folky rock with a couple of more noisy numbers thrown in for good measure. I remember getting this at succot (feast of the tabernacles) where we sit in temporary structures to remind us of the transience of life so it quite suited the situation really. Not recomended as party music.
B00005JN08|4.0|I normally hate gross-out films so the only reason I went to see Eurotrip is for Michelle Trachtenberg's post-Buffy debut.  I kept laughing throughout the film.  There is very little gross-out humor.  Its mostly sex and fish-out-of-water humor which is especially funny if you've traveled through Europe.  I don't see how the film can be insulting to Europe because its a comedy.  The only bad part was when they messed with the Vatican but the rest of the film was excellent.  I cannot wait to buy the DVD.
B0000CFW87|3.0|Josh Groban's voice is so beautiful.  His first CD was a pure delight, track after track.  This CD does have its bright spots, &quot;When you say you love me&quot; and the much overplayed &quot;You lift me up&quot;.  However the balance of the the CD falls short, not with his voice but with the song selection.  Because there is so much hype for this CD, I wanted listeners to be aware of the inequality between the first and the second CDs. If you just love his voice, by the CD.  I hope you are not dissapointed.
B000002IZ4|5.0|The 90's didn't get much better.  A must have.
B0001HAISG|3.0|I followed the development of this film for a year, and was so excited about seeing it, however when the time came and I saw Tinkerbell rendered as an idiotic, comedic mime, I just couldn't enjoy the film as much as I wanted to.  A fairy should possess some kind of mystique, and I guess it was just a victim of mis-guided producing.  It seemed they were trying to make it a little darker and mature, while at the same time dragging it down with some deplorable obligation to a preschool audience.  It had amazing potential, most of which was realised... if only they had let Tinkerbell stay dead.
B00018D44U|4.0|Norah Jones absolutely surprised me with this album. I don't own, but have heard her first album and thought it was decent. It was a good jazz record. This one blew me away. Here we have a contemporary young artist doing good music! It's more country flavoured than her first and with the wailings of Dolly Parton it is an awesome listen! It's a quiet sunny Sunday afternoon listen. The highlights are &quot;Sunrise&quot;, &quot;Creep On In&quot; and Tom Waits' &quot;Long Way Home&quot;.
B0000YWKHC|5.0|Lost in Translation isn't just brilliant. It's ethereal. The plot? Two lonely souls (funny how you can be in a roomful of people and still feel all alone, huh?) discover each other in a foreign land. That's it? No, but a picture is worth a thousand words, so go watch this movie.
1401300901|5.0|I couldn't put this book down! It was a touching,yet very  funny story. Throughout the hilarious moments with her girlfriends,you can still sense Holly's struggle with her grief. Cecelia Ahern describes the pain of losing a spouse so clearly, that I hugged my husband a little tighter than usual while reading it. The laughter through tears moments made this a wonderful book!
0385512104|5.0|In the second chapter of this book (actually labelled as \\"3\\" because this is the second prime number), we are introduced to Christopher, the narrator, who is writing a mystery novel as a class project.  Christopher is an extremely intelligent 15-year old who just happens to be autistic.  He begins his tale by relating his discovery of a neighbor's dog, which had been murdered with a garden fork.  Because he likes both dogs and mysteries, Christopher sets off to find the killer, but what starts as a story about a dog becomes a story about Christopher's life.  Not only do we learn about Christopher's many quirks, but also we learn the explanations for his seemingly irrational behavior, making it seem almost logical.  The book is surprising funny, as Christopher, with his limited emotional range, makes the perfect straight man.  Overall a delightful, different, and quick little read.
0385504209|4.0|After finishing the DaVinci Code, I have to say that this is one of the best novels that I have read in awhile.  After reading the first few pages, I quickly became engrossed in the story.  At its core, the plot is pretty basic, but the extra details and twists that are added in along the way, definately make this novel unique.<br />  The DaVinci Code is written in a style that flows well and makes it easy to read, the author is able to write a realitively  complex plot without confusing the reader.  The chapters are pretty short and are written in several different points of view, that keep the story moving along, with out getting too repetitive.  The mini history lessons that accompany the plot are actualy quite interesting, and those alone make the book a worthwhile read.  The plot is interesting and enough to hold your attention, but around the end it does lose some of the excitement that it initialy had.  As for the characters, there definately are several unusual ones in the book, and I found the majority of them to be both realistic and interesting.<br />  While the book isn't perfect, it is definately entertaining and teaches the reader quite a bit in the process.  In a way, it reminded me of the movie, The Ring in the sense that they Both started out as pretty basic plots, but along the way you see new details unfold, which transforms it into a much more complicated, and detailed story. The DaVinci code adds a new, more intelligent twist on the classic suspense novel.
0767830555|5.0|Directed by Martin Scorsese, one of the greatest films of the 20th Century. The story about a man drowning in loneliness that desperately seeks the approval of the social lives of those around him. He is Travis Bickle (Robert DeNiro), who (as the film opens) gets a job as a cabbie because of the insomnia he suffers of. He prefers working nights (12 hour shifts), will take anyone anywhere, and still he can't seem to sleep. His point-of-view is an ingenius cinematic approach whereas it is viewed in slow-motion (which symbolizes his heightened observation). There are so many undercurrents within the film that even Bickle himself doesn't realize. There is an apparent prejudice against african-americans (the usual stereotype of them all being pimps or drug dealers - and ironically enough when Bickle finally does meet a pimp, he turns out to be white). <br />Bickle bides his time in a coffee shop where all the 'night shift' cabbies hang out. He listens to them ramble about imaginary women who give them $500 tips and their phone number to somewhere in South America. His attention wanders and his inability to socialize presents an awkward air that is at times difficult to watch. <br />Bickle eventually meets Betsy (Cybil Shepherd) who is an avid supporter of the presidential candidate Palantine. His former view of the inhabitants of New York as &quot;scum&quot; is finally changed when he meets a girl who &quot;is not like the rest of them&quot;. He asks her out to a movie and it turns out to be porn. He knew it was porn (he goes to the same theatre every night he's off work), but he doesn't go for the usual reason people go, he gets no satisfaction out of it, it is as if he's punishing himself for having walked into such a place. He seems to not realize why she looks at him with disgust and eventually leaves and never wants to see him again. <br />Bickle is a &quot;walking contradiction&quot; whereas he sees the world as evil and wrong, but in his attempts at being accepted, he finds himself bending the rules of morality and becoming what he despises.<br />He comes across a 12-year old prostitute named, Iris (Jodie Foster), who he immediately likes, but the only way he can be near her is to pay for &quot;half an hour&quot;. He does so, and despite her attempts to &quot;make it&quot;, he tries to tell her that he's come to set her free from the life of prostitution. &quot;Don't you want to get out of here?&quot; he asks. &quot;But it saves me from myself,&quot; she answers innocently. He leaves frustrated.<br />Bickle is (like the John Wayne character in &quot;The Searchers&quot;) trying to rescue women who don't want to be rescued. It becomes his obsession that these women are being oppressed and that his goal in life is to set them free.<br />His obsession leads to violence when he purchases weapons and attempts to assassinate Palantine, but runs away almost as if, at the last moment, coming to his senses. But that is only the &quot;dress rehearsel&quot; for the climax of the film which is one of the most graphic scenes of violence ever filmed. It is shot in 'washed out' colors as if the ensuing violence has drained the blood from the film. <br />The famous line, &quot;Are you talkin' to me? Well I'm the only one here,&quot; spoken to himself in a mirror, has been many times mimiced but the meaning can only be fully realized in this film. It is the voice of a lonely man amidst the crowd, a voice of sarcasm at his own worthless condition. The condition we all find ourselves in from time to time.<br />The film ends with Bickle meeting Betsy one more time as he is driving her home in his cab (by a chance meeting). Her look has changed from one of disgust to admiration and the viewer senses that this scene is not real. That it is either his final dying thoughts or simply a fantasy in his mind. It is Bickle finally finding redemption, finally finding his place in society. It has all been resolved and now he can lead a normal life or die happily.
B000099T2L|5.0|I got this CD last Christmas from my grandparents and I am really glad I own it. Apparently, several people over the world seem to think Beyonce is a talented artist. Come on... Look at all those grammys she won! This album is nicely done, and here are my ratings:<BR>1)Crazy In Love 8/10- Good song, but a little too overplayed<BR>2)Naughty Girl 10/10- One of my favorite songs, I love the beat and the Tina Turner lyrics<BR>3)Baby Boy 9/10- I would have given it a 10, but I have been hearing way too much lately...<BR>4)Hip Hop Star 8/10- It's okay, nothing I would kill to listen to everyday<BR>5)Be With You 10/10- Another one of my favorites<BR>6)Me, Myself, &amp; I 10/10- Another great song, let's hope they don't play out this one<BR>7)Yes 7/10- I don't really pay attention to this song<BR>8)Signs 9/10- Another favorite, very slow, soothing beat<BR>9)Speechless 6/10-It's okay but slow and boring<BR>10)That's How You Like It 10/10-Another favorite, great dance beat and lyrics<BR>11)The Closer I Get To You 10/10- Very nice remake and duet with Luther Vandross<BR>12)Dangerously In Love 2 7/10- Not bad, although I don't really listen<BR>13)Beyonce Interlude 5/10- Like I said before, I do not listen to interludes<BR>14)Gift From Virgo 7/10- Okay, not a favorite<BR>15)Daddy 9/10- Good song, kinda reminds me of memories with my father and me<BR>**I hope to hear more Beyonce records in the future!!!!
B00018D44U|2.0|This CSW was nothing special.  I enjoyed her first CD, but this one is a little more &quot;blah&quot;.   I was hoping she would use her sultry voice and continue with the bluesy type songs.   This album leans more toward country, and is really not her style.  I wouldn't recommend this album.  Keep listening to &quot;Come Away With Me&quot;!
B00008WT5E|5.0|Bon Scott's voice, a rhythm section designed for industrial-strength rock and roll, and some of the best bluesy guitar work ever put on vinyl or into ones and zeroes.  You've heard the dozens of rock and roll standards, but this album has gems beyond the publicly adored stuff.  &quot;What's Next to the Moon&quot; and &quot;Down Payment Blues&quot; are both amazing.  Who am I kidding?  The whole album's amazing.
0790729652|5.0|This is undeniably the best in the whole Batman series. 1989 brang the dark knight to a whole new level. Batman was idolized by everyone now. Thye movie isnt quite dark, well nowhere as dark as the next film [Batman Returns] but it sure has its awkward moments. The Joker is by far the best of the film though Jack Nicholson is a bit annoying but his perfomance is outstanding. It is scary in the way Joker falls into acid, his girlfiends new face is very creepy, but this movie is the best in the whole series and it definitley deserved the MAJOR credit it got. This is one film that people MUST-SEE!!! The dark knight debut is amazingly well done by the awesome director Tim Burton. SEE THIS NOW! The DVD extras are OK , interesting but definitley should've had interviews, a documentary or anything like that I really dont consider &quot;Production notes&quot; to be a {SPECIAL} Feature!!.<br />BUT U JUST GOTTA SEE BATMAN 1 IT IS AWESOME!
B000002GFC|3.0|I bought this off the ebay and thought maybe I had been hoodwinked into purchasing some crappy BMG record club selection or something.  Closer examination reveals that this was released in 1995 which means that it missed out on a proper re-mastering.  The hissing sound is very audible in the background and just drives me crazy.  This super-group deserves a new re-master, 2004 style.  Otherwise, most all the Cream a normal person needs.
0790730960|4.0|1992 saw the release of the much anticipating &quot;Batman: Returns&quot; and it really is a mixed feeling movie. Its enjoyable but in the way it dosent match its predessor &quot;Batman&quot; it is very cool how it is all dark and got a creepy vibe and its storyline is OK but it just dosent really meet perfection. Penguin is absolutely disgusting and i really hate him and Catwoman is cool but in other words they are cool villians. Same &quot;SPECIAL&quot; featues as #1. This film is good and I reccomend you to see it but if u have to choose 1 out of the 2 &quot;Batman&quot; is the way to go.
B0000AQS0F|5.0|...but briefly. It's hard to express how refreshing it was to find a series this complex and thoughtful on network TV. I recommend it to any fans of science fiction - not necessarily Western fans, despite the American Frontier feel of it, it's solid sci-fi. Some viewers' gripes to the contrary, the idea that newly settled planets would be horse-and-buggy tech is hardly new in science fiction. Check this series out if you haven't seen it. Terrific characters, very solid acting and effects. I have my fingers crossed for the movie, if they manage to make one. Please support this series!

B000002I2G|5.0|Though loathed by some, &quot;The Soft Parade&quot; finds the Doors exploring new sounds, new arrangements, etc.  Many fans were put off by the brass and strings which dominated many of the cuts.  I just consider it an experiment.  Personally, I like it.  I also like the Doors enough that, in hindsight, I will give the album five stars.<br />God, how I miss the '60's!  Experimental albums such as &quot;The Soft Parade,&quot; the Stones' &quot;Satanic Majesties,&quot; the Airplane's &quot;After Bathing at Baxter's,&quot; the Beatles' &quot;Sgt. Pepper,&quot; would be tossed aside by major labels in today's music industry.  No wonder bands like the Doors, the Stones, the Beatles, still sell amazing numbers of CDs thirty-odd years after either disbanding or producing their best work.  The albums by these bands stand the test of time.  Bands that experiment and follow their muse, wherever it takes them, will always remain relevant because that constant search for perfection, enlightenment, call it what you will, is what brings meaning to life and art.<br />&quot;The Soft Parade&quot; sounds just as exciting and vital today as it was when it was released thirty-five years ago.  How many of today's albums will human beings long to hear in 2039?
B0000074BS|5.0|To the reviewer who said this album was mostly unknown outside the circle of Talk Talk aficionados, you're in luck! I hadn't even HEARD of the band until I saw this album mentioned in an interview of Rick Wright, Pink Floyd's keyboardist. On a lark I decided to give it a try--and sure enough, his taste proved extraordinary.<br />&quot;The simplicity of the songs and Mark Hollis's voice make this album just incredible,&quot; Mr. Wright had explained to Record Collector magazine. &quot;The first tune, 'Happiness Is Easy', says it all--nothing but a bass, a snare and a weird chord. That's Talk Talk all over, great songs and simplicity with a twist ... Why does it touch me? Hard to say, but it's got the feelgood factor, which all my favourite records have...&quot;<br />From the second I heard the opening to &quot;Happiness is Easy&quot;, I knew every word of Mr. Wright's was dead-on accurate. &quot;Colour of Spring&quot; is indeed a most appropriate title--I immediately felt a sense of gentle, uplifting power coming from the music. Although pensive, sometimes even sad in the lyrics at times, he does not go overboard with it. Mr. Hollis' voice becomes like a musical instrument in its own right, mingling perfectly with the open, never overpowering musical arrangements.<br />Particularly striking about this album are the Hammond organ played by Steve Winwood, which floats gently in the background and provides each track is atmosphere. The acoustic guitar and piano seem to dance gracefully in and out of the songs. Overall, Colour of Spring is incredibly soothing, but without putting the listener to sleep. This is the perfect album to unwind from a stressful day, and definitely a recommendation worth listening to!
B00003CXXP|5.0|Steven Spielberg's \\"A.I.\\" was one of the most imaginative films in the year of its release, but the powers that be were not aware of it, the Academy choosing as Best Picture a sword-and-sandal romp. Originally picked as a movie project by Stanley Kubrick (it's dedicated to him), \\"A.I.\\" combines that director's ideas (there are impressions of \\"2001: A Space Odyssey\\" and \\"A Clockwork Orange\\") with the domestic themes associated with Spielberg. In an unspecified post-deluvian age robots (called \\"mechas\\" and used primarily for servile jobs) have become increasingly utilized and despised. The head of a robotics firm (William Hurt) dreams of creating a mecha that can do just that -- dream. The obvious choice is a child, so David is constructed by the firm and \\"adopted\\" by an employee and the employee's wife whose own son is comatose. Brought into the home of Henry and Monica, the doll-like David's reactions are strangely inappropriate. (His first words are \\"I like your floor\\".) Initially repelled by David's unblinking smile and mecha-nized politeness, Monica (a difficult role well-handled by Frances O'Connor) is eventually drawn to the robot and, following the prescribed instructions, she unlocks the filial love which has been programmed into him. A problem occurs when Monica's real son comes out of his coma and returns home. Contemptous of the mecha, the \\"orga\\" boy causes conflicts which doom David's chances of staying with Monica; and the scene where Monica deserts David in a forest has a Grimm-like terror. Then the script opens a completely different story line as we follow the misadventures of a mechastud Gigolo Joe (Jude Law)who, fleeing the police, comes across the disconsolately wandering David -- and his companion, a super-toy Teddy bear. Together, David and Joe are captured by orga entrepreneurs and forced into what is called a Flesh Fair, a sort of circus of horrors where robots are violently destroyed for the thrilled amusement of humans. (Actually, it looks pretty much like a demolition derby.) Escaping the fair, David and Joe proceed to a neon-drenched Rouge City (you'll hear a quote from \\"Der Rosenkavalier\\" -- Kubrick's idea), David seeking Pinocchio's Blue Fairy, the power to help him become a real boy and win his mother's love. There's a very funny scene when they visit Dr Know (\\"There's nothing he doesn't\\"), designed to look like Einstein and voiced by Robin Williams. Advised by this cartoon guru, David and Joe enter an inundated Manhattan and an unsettling glimpse of the World Trade Center -- which, of course, wouldn't exist in the future. (\\"A.I.\\" was released in June of 2001.)At this point the film becomes more abstract (and it should be stressed this fairy tale is not for children), but I think it's here that Kubrick and Spielberg merge most successfully. The ending is dark but gentle: throughout the story David has longed to be a real boy -- in other words, a mortal -- and at the end his dream comes true. John Williams' lovely score is especially effective in these final scenes. The outstanding quality of \\"A.I.\\" is the almost Garboesque acting of Haley Joel Osment as David. In scene after scene, he displays a remarkable sensitivity. The performances and special effects were some of the best of that year, and the screenplay was one of the best-written. But, as I said, the Academy chose to brush aside the whole production. Perhaps it thought \\"A.I.\\" stood for Absolutely Ignore.
B0000C7PQK|3.0|Having heard all of Enigma's albums prior to this, it seems to me that Michael Cretu has reached a crossroads--but not one that I'd particularly hoped for, myself.  Gone, it seems, are the musings upon life and the vast, sweeping, and graceful sound I've previously associated with Enigma.  What has replaced it is something that rides dangerously close to a very average, bland sort of techno.  Voyageur is not a total loss; don't get me wrong.  Mr. Cretu does get points for moving forward in terms of experimention with different moods than those previously heard; while other albums have had a much more optimistic feel by the end, and have also been somewhat cyclical in nature, this one has a rather darker character; the final outro was certainly a surprise to me.  There's something grittier in the mixing, a heavy distortion that sometimes works--sometimes seems like ovrekill.  I do give Mr. Cretu credit for the distortions on his own vocals, which have quite an interesting effect.<br />Gone are the samples of world music and Gregorian chant.  Although there are no *directly* sampled loops, there is one intriguing &quot;tribute&quot; buried on the title track, to the keyboard playing of Pink Floyd's Richard Wright on the studio version of &quot;Set the Controls for the Heart of the Sun&quot;.  This is the one place where the distortion of the sound makes complete sense; if you listen to the distortions in Mr. Wright's initial playing, it's very clear that Mr. Cretu has emulated it down to the last detail.<br />Speaking of Pink Floyd, in bands like that, the shift towards a heavier, more brooding atmosphere often signals a move towards a more serious approach to music--but with Enigma, I'm not entirely convinced that's happening.  In fact, I'm quite shocked that something with such infantile lyrics as &quot;Boum-Boum&quot; was released with the Enigma name--if I want something with so little substance (and I do not), I'll turn on a &quot;Top 40&quot; station.  &quot;Myheart goes boom-boom-boom...every time I think of you!&quot; repeated ad infinitum...come on, Britney Spears can do better!  &quot;Weightless&quot; comes fairly close to a similar degree of emptiness, although *nothing* beats &quot;Boum-Boum&quot; in the vapid department.<br />That is not to say this album and new direction are wholly without merit: &quot;Incognito&quot;/&quot;Page of Cups&quot; is certainly an interesting foray into darker territory for Enigma.  &quot;Total Eclipse&quot;, &quot;In the Shadow and the Light&quot;, and most particularly the ethereal and beautiful track, &quot;The Piano&quot;, will probably be the most satisfying for fans of the classic Enigma.  I admit, also, that when I hear a piece like &quot;The Look of Today&quot;, I wonder if perhaps Mr. Cretu *has* decided to move towards serious social commentary, even satire.  While &quot;The Look of Today&quot; wears the mask of empty techno, there's something quite biting in his delivery.<br />The trouble is, he needs to be careful of just how much of this vacuousness he allows into his work or he may lose his identity in the process.  What is also annoying to me as a listener is the *inconsistency* of quality--something I've never heard before from Enigma, not even on the debut album as is the case with most artists.  I notice that while the album begins as all Enigma albums do with that typical &quot;signature riff&quot;, it's abandoned at the end...a clear signal of a shift towards something else.  The problem is, what will that transition be to, when it's complete?  Overall, Voyageur is an album that, in many ways, is hovering upon the brink--between light and dark, between satire and sellout.  Does the cold feeling I get at the end indicate Enigma's success, or its failure?<br />I can only hope that in his next venture, Mr. Cretu will properly assess the merits and deficiencies of Voyageur, and respond accordingly...I hope he's thought out where he's headed.
B00005JLPK|5.0|The film Frida and the accompanying background material here is a visual entertainment that seems to be oriented with the current fascination with her art as an expression of inwardly turned, self-referential, and pyscholoigcal concerns that seem to pass as social concern these days. The acting, direction, and production design here are all masterful. Yet, there seems to be a simplification to enable glorification.  Frida emerges as a saint, a heroine, but not a real person.<br />People I knew who knew her 1938-1942 and the biographies that were written about her before she began to be taken up by the New York hipsters, tended to talk about how the pain and difficulty of her life were expressed in a personality that was not exactly the sweet, sunny, firm clear, fair and always just character portrayed in the movie. The condition created by the Frida Fad of the past 10 years has made her into such a non-person, such a glorified abstraction, that otherwise serious grownups who have no real knowledge other than she is now popular and \\"collectable\\" wince when you tell them people world wide for their warmth, judgement, and trust who saw her every day for years could say that Frida was not always fun to be around. No less than the Diego depicted in her film, Kahlo did not really understand the consequences her own personal picadillos and adventures could have on people who had more conventional views of life and love, and who needed stability in life.<br />The movie and the accompanying DVD background material were either false or ignorant about why Trotsky moved out of the Blue House.  He did not move out because of Natalia Sedova's anger over the affair. [ The affair really break Natalia's heart and almost caused a split among the Trotskys, although that split was healed. Trotsky is almost rapsodic in his diary when he realizes his love for Natalya is there emotionally and physically and they are still together.] Trotsky and the Riveras split due to a deep and public political disagreement over elections in Mexico. Diego was making public statements that gave people the impression that Trotsky was backing a right-wing candidate for President of Mexico that Trotsky stridently opposed. Moroever, Diego's actions gave the false impression that Trotsky was publically intervening in Mexican politics, something Trotsky resolutely refused to do.  Both Trotsky and the Mexican section of the Fourth International, the world organization Trotsky founded, had to disassociate themselves from Deigo at this point.<br />This movie uses Kahlo's association with Trotsky to give a gloss to her and Rivera. Unlike the Mexican movie made about her entitled Freida (this is the name Kahlo was born with, not Frida), this film does not tell the view that in the late 1940s, Rivera and Kahlo became ultra-Stalinists.  They revived their friendship with David Alfred Siqueros who had attempted to murder Trotsky.  Frida Kahlo issued public statements denouncing herself for having had sex with Trotsky and pledged her eternal devotion to Stalin. Of course, this aspect of her life doesn't fit into the kind of marketable hagiagraphy that has less concern with the reality of a person and of politics than it does with a marketable image. It is true you do see a picture of Stalin on a canvas toward the end, but it is not clear to anyone who isn't already familiar with the story.<br />I also was disappointed in the actor they had playing Diego. He played his part extremely well, but he was just not the right person for anyone to think to be Diego. The person was an English actor, apparently of Italian or Spanish origin.<br />Diego was mostly if not entirely Indian, whereas Frida was actually half German Jewish.  Diego actually did the rough outlines and instructions of his murals and then got very indigenous Indians to paint in the colors with their rough brush strokes.<br />This attempt to identify with the non-European art and culture and political identity of Mexicowas a big part of what Diego and Frida were about, but it gets no play or reference in the movie. Frida adopted the regional dress of one of the most indigenous areas of Mexico,rather than follow the Europe-centered fashions of Mexico's intelligensia. Mexico is a nation where the the vast majority, the scores of millions of people of mixed and all Indian blood have traditionally struggled against an elite which emphasizes its \\"Spanish\\" ancestry.  Diego's proclamation of his Indianness and his sucess in Mexico as a mostly Indian cultural figure, and Frida's decision to identify with this was central to their lives and impact on their times.<br />To me what is rather unfortunate is that while Kahlo's art was interesting and beautiful, and great in some ways, Diego is simply lost in all of this. He was one of the great artists of the 20th Century, far more significant than Kahlo in his impact on Mexican, Latin American, and world culture. Moreover, particularly for Mexicans and other Latin Americans, the cultural ideas about reclaiming the Indian identity and linking with the popular masses and the pre-Columbian cultures that he advanced were very important, not just for artists, but in political and literary circles as well. Diego played an important role fighting with his friend Andre Breton in charting an independent and radical artistic and intellectual response to Stalinist theory of \\"socialist realist\\" art.  Pathfinder Press has just come out with a brand new updated and better noted and glosseried edition of Breton's What is Surrealism which contains the declaration on Art and Artists in the 20th Century that Deigo, Trotsky, and Breton wrote together.<br />Of course, all of Deigo's work dealt with the political struggle of Mexico and the world's working people to fight against imperialism and capitalism. This isn't very marketable among the upper middle class fadists at whom this film seems to aimed. They prefer a Frida and a Diego whose personal concerns about romance, sex, and personal fame are at the center of their lives, not two fighters for a socialist world!was a big part of what Diego and Frida were about, but it gets no play or reference in the movie.

0385504209|5.0|It was so exciting reading Dan's researched fiction that it made me long for more books like this. The intriguing time line and the details of the codes in this book are alluring to say the least. You'll never look at the Last Supper the same way. Don't want to be a spoiler, but I could not put this book down. An easy read if you've already studied this stuff in art history, etc.
B00011D1RC|5.0|Finally on DVD, Grand Hotel is an early talkie classic that deserves all the praise it has received over the (many) years. The film offers some truly great performances, production quality, and a gripping story about the various people who stay at the Grand Hotel and how their particular lives intertwine.  There is Garbo as a &quot;disillusioned ballerina,&quot; who is particularly meloncholic and manic. She goes from low to high and then low again quite fast, you may wonder if she is schizoprenic. Then again, there are some devastating closeups to put all detractors to rest.  <br />As for Joan Crawford, all that needs to be said is that she is timeless as the ambitious stenographer (with, as it turns out at the end, a good heart).  She offers the only performance in the film that would fit right in with modern audiences.  There isn't a hint of the archaic silent style that other actors of the time were holding on to, and her style and appearance come across as very contemporary and likeable.  <br />John and Lionel Barrymore are also terrific as two good-hearted people who are facing bad times. One has no luck and resorts to theft and the other has the first good luck in his life, even as he is dying. Wally Beery is also memorable as the rather careless boss.<br />Best thing about this DVD?  I'd have to say the excellent picture quality of this legendary film, the legendary performances it contains, and the very special 1932 film premiere clip of Grand Hotel (on the extra features section).  There we can see Joan in her prime, and apparently as shy and full of humility as most of her detractors would never guess she possessed.
B0001AP12G|5.0|I thought Kayne album was going to be a typical rap album, Boring. So I end up getting the bootleg first to check it out. After listing to it, I had ran to Best Buy to buy the Album. This one of the best rap albums I've heard in while, other than Outkast. The only thing I wish Kanye would have done was left off some of his cameos. Even though the cameos help make Kanye's songs tight, I would have like to hear Kanye more by himself. Overall, College Dropout is a hell of debut album, a must have.
B00005NGZX|5.0|this thing is absolutely incredible. some of the most honest metalcore you will hear. converge meld metal, hardcore and noise in ways you have never heard before. some songs like &quot;heaven in her arms&quot; flat out rock, but then it goes in to the beautiful, textured, downright ethereal &quot;phoenix in flight&quot;. thats what makes them so great...those types of dynamics. converge are easily the best hardcore/metal band out there now. they get better with every release. buy this as proof.
B0000AQS0F|5.0|Firefly was one of the pinnacles of television for me.  It was the product of group of people who truly believed in what they were doing. Great Writing, Great Directing, Great Acting...<BR>I look forward to any other avenues that this franchise might take... be it movies, books or anything.  And I know that something will come becuse there is just to much unfinished.  <br />You can't take the sky from me.
B00006J9OT|5.0|Diana Krall delivers a wonderful concert to her fans in Paris and to everyone who enjoys live recordings without all the polish and remixing of a studio recording.  She sings and plays with feeling and does some really great piano solos and isn't afraid to let her fellow musicians share the spotlight with their respective talents.  This is a wonderful cd and it is only surpassed in enjoyability by the dvd of that same performance.
B00003CXWV|5.0|ok.. ill tell you now that this is the best movie have have ever seen in my life. It would take one [heck] of an outstanding movie to beat this one. This is the only movie i can watch over and over and over again at any time, all my friends like it to. Johnny Depp plays the perfect role in this movie. Money/Sex/Drugs can either bring u happyness but in George Jungs case it really did him in at the end. Buy a copy of Blow I gaurentee you will be satisfied
B00018D44U|4.0|This is a really good cd.  It is different from Come Away With Me because of the country feel of most of the songs.  She plays and sings well and is backed up by her capable band.  With 13 tracks, there is plenty of music to listen to and enjoy.  <br />The Bandlink software is sort of a pain because you can't listen to her via pc without it installed and there are some tight restrictions on adding software to the computers where I work.  I'll be more careful to watch out for products that include Bandlink.  <br />Overall, I think fans of Norah Jones will enjoy this cd.
B00005JLT5|5.0|I really loved this movie.  I could not even leave the room while it was on.  YOU have to see this.  A++++++++++++++++
B000002J09|5.0|This is the cd in which everyone will remember becuz of three points.<br />1. The last early days cd<br />2. The amazing 8 minute song &quot;Stairway to Heaven&quot;<br />3. The different voice of Robert Plant<br />I do not think there is any really bad song on this cd. Of course, it's just my opinon, but this is the number 1 cd of all time.<br />1. Black Dog - Ahh yes, this song really starts off the cd with a bang. First you hear Robert Plant sing, and then kick in the instruments. 10/10<br />2. Rock &amp; Roll - Fast paced song for Led Zeppelin, and seems to be a bit short, but still a well deserved song on the cd. 11/10<br />3. The Battle Of Evermore - Robert Plant and some woman, I can't remember her name, sing a song is perfect from start to finish. Soft but certainly brings out the beauty of the cd. 9/10<br />4. Stairway To Heaven - Amazing song... this song moves fast for an 8 min song, and shows that Led Zeppelin can turn such a sorrow song into a masterpiece. 15/10<br />5. Misty Mountain Hop - It's a great song. PERIOD! 10/10<br />6. Four Sticks - People would like to dance to this song cuz it's so up-paced. And yes, the singers voice can get tiring after a while, but it still is a rock hard song. 11/10<br />7. Going To California - Robert Plant's lyrics are so perfect! It makes you more relaxed than any other song. 12/10<br />8. When The Levee Breaks - Finally, the best conclusion to a cd ever. Last songs generally tend to be the best, but you know this song is even better than those ones. 20/10<br />This is a perfect buy, definetly number 1 on the top of my classic rock list. Get it now!
B00005JN08|1.0|Uhm yeah... so I hoped that after David Hasselhoff singing in EuroTrip it couldn't get worse anymore. But it did get worse. This movie [is not good]. All the clichés in this movie. I guess they thought they were being funny exaggerating stuff about countries in Europe - like the hooligans in the UK, the charming guys in France, the gay Italians, the Netherlands and prostitution and what ... me off most - the German child called Heinrich (last name probably Himmler?) dressing up as Hitler. I felt that scene was so offensive that I finally had to quit watching this movie. And besides all of these stupid stories about European countries it still seemed like in reality they had not left the USA at all, because most people still acted just like Americans. I had the impression the people who made this movie have never actually seen all of these countries nor met anyone who comes from one of those countries. Really sad story. But I should have known... with David Hasselhoff it couldn't get better.<br />I guess you must be totally brain dead to like this movie. That must be one of DreamWorks' worst movies ever.<br />Now I do not even know whether the American guy and German girl got together. But after all this I hope the German girl kicked the American guy's ... real hard and chose one of our German Nazis instead and made Arian kids with him.
0385504209|2.0|On occasion this story was good, but after the author used the same technique to cheat the audience repeatedly just to keep some suspense going, I started to get bored.<br />It is also interesting to note that every extra (disposable) character in the same scene has the exact same reaction as all the others.  I didn't realize there were still so many sheep bleating overseas.<br />If you want a good story and don't mind the author's poor writing skills, this is a decent attempt.  I must admit I was amazed when I realized Dan Brown had been published before - I thought the mistakes he made were because he was a beginner!
0140277447|5.0|The Rape of Nanking is a very chilling and sobering account of atrocities commited by Japanese soldiers upon civilians when they took the Chinese city of Nanking in WW2. The author uses first hand accounts of the soldiers themselves, the victims, and observors from other countries in her book. At the time it took place, the atrocities were front page news in the New York Times and other large newspapers, including newspapers in Japan. A major source is the diary of a German Nazi who saved thousands of Chinese lives. <BR>There can be no doubt that something terrible happened in Nanking, China. Perhaps the numbers can be questioned, but the fact that attrocities happened cannot be questioned at all. Please read the book and judge for yourself, rather than go by the one star reviews here. And please be aware that you must have a strong stomach when reading it. :(
0786867973|5.0|This a truly wonderful cookbook. And the first that I've ever wanted to own.<br />For a person with as yet very (very) rudimentary cooking skills I felt not a trace of intimidation after looking over numerous recipes. Finally, interesting and yummy sounding food that I just may be able to make without wasting ingredients! And no matter who you are intending to entice with any of Lawson's recipes they will no doubt be welcome and greatly appreciated. Not to mention gone as soon as it is placed in front of them! (There really is something for everyone here.) The few baking excursions I have taken since I found this book came out surprisingly well and with little effort. I've still to try some (okay most) of the harder recipes, but the success I have had so far is encouraging indeed. <br />As much as I enjoyed the food, I also enjoyed reading Lawson's remarks about each entry. Her voice is engaging and she truly gives you a great sense as to where each recipe is coming from. I never thought I would want to read a cookbook, but there you have it--I've already been through *How To Be a Domestic Goddess* twice. <br />I can't speak for Lawson's other books, but if you do like to bake (or would like to learn) this is a very good place to start.

B000004286|5.0|This soundtrack is by far my favorite of any that I own.  I listen to it practically everyday, and in every aspect it is perfect.  It fits the movie perfectly, and it stands on its own as a tribute to traditional, moving celtic music.  James Horner is an amazing composer, and this soundtrack will move you with such stirring tracks as \\"Freedom/The Execution/Bannockburn\\" and will have you waiting for more after the final track.  This is a definite must-have for any movie lover, or lover of just plain beautiful music.
B0000AZJXQ|5.0|Thirteenth Step is a good cd. It doesn't quite sound the same as their first release,  but there's nothing wrong with that. Maynard is very talented and I look forward to more releases in the future. Tool will always be my favorite though! :)
B000021XS0|5.0|Don't, for one second, read any of the reviews below 3 stars. If you do the mindless idiots who write the reviews will turn you away from one of the greatest albumd ever made. Those people have no musical concepts within them, and are not up to the level of Dream Theater<br />Now, this album is a pure masterpiece. It consists of everything that their should be. It has emotion, heaviness, amzing technical playing, and too many other things to list. You have to check it out yourself. I've listened to this cd 30+ times, and it gets better everytime. John Petrucci is one of the greatest guitarists I have ever heard in my life. He came up with timeless solos and riffs in this album. Jordan Rudess, Mike Portnoy, James LaBrie, and John Myung also shine on this album.<br />You know what! I would write more about the greatness of this album and the superb playing ability of each band member, but I have to go listen to this cd again!<br />P.S. Pick up Liquid Tension Experiment 1 and 2 as well
B00018D44U|4.0|I saw Nora in concert last year and she played a lot the new songs from this CD that night.  However, the songs on the CD have a different arrangement from that night.  Mostly gone are the organ and jazz piano replaced with guitars, softer piano and more of a country arrangement.  You can tell that most of the songs were written on guitar.  Jessie Harris of Come Away with Me fame does play on 2 songs, but does not write on this CD.  Lee Alexander who wrote a lot of songs from the last CD writes most of the tracks along with Nora.  What you have here is a more complete CD and one that develops more upon each listen.  This CD has no obvious singles, so the beauty is to be discovered.   I was hoping for more of a jazz organ sound, but the organ only appears on two tracks.  I would describe this, still like the first CD, as jazzy nocturnal sounding with some country western overtones.  This is at least a 4 star CD, IMO, and the track with Dolly is pretty awesome.  Do yourself a favor and buy this.  You will be surprised how different in concert the songs will be played.  It will be nice to compare them.  Besides, this is another classic offering from someone that I hope is around a long time.
B000002URV|5.0|Enigma is by far one of the major phenomenon in music.<BR>The music is going to take you to a dream like state, and you'll never want to return to reality. Better than anything one could sniff. There is only one thing better than Enigma's music, the Enigma's music DVDs.<BR>If you listen, or specially watch, Mea Culpa and Beyond the Invisible, and you are not deeply moved and forever changed, there is no hope for you, and you'll forever know only one narrow side of life.<BR>For the gentlemen that wrote in his review that what Enigma does is marketing, I would like to point that that statement is totally wrong for the following reason: How many of you have ever heard about an Enigma tour, on camera interview, a red carpet walk to any social event, or anything that would put them in the spot light? Of course nobody heard about any of these, because they never do any of these things. Why? Because they wanted their fans to concentrate on the music, not on the people. Who loves Enigma, loves their music, not necessarily the people behind it. To me that is worth a lot, and actually it is preety bad marketing, by American standards. Unfortunately, nowadays too few people do art for the love of it, not for the money. <BR>As of the people behind Enigma, until 5 - 6 years ago, only rumors existed. Looking deep behind the mystery, hype, and prejudice, one can find the Gothic, the Gregorian, the Roman numerals, the Cathedrals, as real part of the ancestry in which many have roots, including Cretu (Curly) and the forever changing gang behind the music. Nothing less could one expect from the land that brought us vampires, Orthodoxy, and the Gothic (I am not talking about young people painted in black wearing weird clothes).<BR>Given all this, no one can touch, or come even close, to Enigma's music and the feelings they inspire.<BR>If you Mr. Robert J. Murphy do not agree, better stick to your RAP...
0805062971|4.0|I really enjoyed this book even though I saw the movie first.  I would recomend this book to anyone who has ever felt that things weren't what they thought they were.  You really should read the book first because there are differences.  The world of Tyler Durden is full of intrege and intellegent thought.  What he helps the men realize is that they are not special and that they are not what society wants them to be.  If you have ever felt trapped by the consumerism that the world pushes on you just lash out and quit buying all that garbage.  You really start to feel the same way Tyler feels towards the rest of the world.  This is an emotionally charged ride with many ups and downs.  I really recommend this book to all and will read it many more times in the future.
B0001611DI|3.0|3 stars for this DVD's features, 5 stars for the movie itself.I am being blunt and to the point to the fans. This DVD sounds to me, like a half-fast rushed job, to get something on the shelves before the popularity of the new Dawn movie takes off, which is due to be released soon. Don't allow yourselves to be sucked in by simply a remastered version (I know it's hard).<br />If you're a real fan like me, you will wait for the directors cut later on this year, with all the bells and whistles that you've been dreaming of. I've seen both versions and the directors cut is the only way the movie should be viewed. The theatrical version is rushed. You may think an extra 20 minutes or so is no big deal, but try to think how many little scenes you can cut out of a movie, with 20 minutes.<br />Trust me, the bells and whistles of the 2 DVD disc set are not to be missed. I have Dawn on my old Laserdisc (It was a total of 4 laserdiscs in a big box and the only way I will watch this classic) and it has most these bells and whistles that i'm speaking of. It has the full original script, with the original \\"Suicide Ending\\" that was rewritten. It also has things like the commercials, the board game, the floor plans of the mall and interviews to name a few. I'm telling you, you will kick yourself for not waiting.
0385510438|3.0|I have ALL of John Grisham's novels and this is the second one written about Clanton Mississippi! Murder(and mayhem) are the topics in two of his novels. I was familiar with one character in this novel, lawyer Harry Rex Vonner, also from &quot;A Time to Kill&quot;. The other characters in this book were well fleshed-out. This book was written from the point of view of a young newspaper publisher, not a lawyer, so it was &quot;different&quot; from the usually brilliant Grisham legal books.<br />If only John's ATTEMPT at writing this book had been as wonderful as his descriptions of &quot;Miss Callie's cooking&quot;, I'd give him 4 stars! <br />I was really looking forward to another 'legal thriller' (as alluded to on the book jacket) but this book did NOT deliver.
B0001AP12G|4.0|Jesus Walks and Never Let Me Down should be required listening for everyone who claims to love hip hop but claims that the music put out these days has any value.  Kanye took it back to a time when the music had a message, but didn't shove it down your throat.  The rest of the album is very good, especially for a first effort.  The skits are funny, they poke fun at a segment of the population that can be egotistical.
B00005JM0B|1.0|This movie is worse than junk: It is revolting junk. I used to be engaged by the action sequences in his movies, but even those are reruns. And with the blatant misogynist attitudes of this &quot;piece&quot;, I am totally put off. My interest in anything Schwarzenegger has dropped to nada! I will have no problem passing over anything this guy has to offer, past or future.

B00004W221|4.0|'RUDY&quot; IS IRISH SENTIMENTALITY, BUT ENTERTAINING<br />&quot;Rudy&quot; (1993) is one of those stories that could only be told about an institution like Notre Dame University. If anybody tried to make a film about a scrub trying to make the varsity at UCLA or Nebraska, they would never get it off the ground. As it is, Rudy Ruettiger had his share of troubles pitching the true tale of his appearance in Notre Dame's final 1975 game to Hollywood.<br />&quot;I had an appointment with a producer,&quot; Ruettiger recalls, &quot;but he didn't show up at the appointed time and place. I was in Santa Monica, and I knew he lived nearby, so I asked the postman if he knew this guy.&quot;<br />Ruettiger looks enough like the Midwestern rube he has been portrayed as than the sort of city psychopath the mailman might have suspected him to be, because he sent him right to the guy's house. The producer tried to fend Rudy off by telling him he was not a Notre Dame fan, but it ended up at Orion Pictures anyway, and was released just as the 1993 college football season was getting underway. Notre Dame coach Lou Holtz actually was threatened with N.C.A.A. penalties because he showed a bootleg copy to his players prior to the opener, trying to inspire the boys a la Knute Rockne. The infraction was providing entertainment to his team not available to the rest of the student body (somebody ought to go on a secret mission to Shawnnee Mission, Kansas and do a demolition of this near-useless organization). Anyway, it worked that day and most days in '93, as the Irish came within one loss to Boston College of the National Championship, but that is a different Irish tale. Despite a pretty good reception, the movie did not save Orion from folding up its operation about a year later.<br />Patty Duke's son, Sean Astin (remember him in &quot;Like Father, Like Son&quot; with Dudley Moore and Kirk Cameron?) stars as a blue-collar kid from a blue-collar family. He is a poor student, and a below-average high school football player despite his very best efforts. Upon graduation he goes to work in the steel mill just like everybody who ever lived in his home town, yet still clings to the fantasy of going to play ball in South Bend. Everybody scoffs at his craziness except his best buddy, who considers Rudy's goal quite within reach.<br />When that buddy is killed in a mill accident, Rudy realizes it is now or never. Despite being closer to graduation than freshman age, he journeys to South Bend, is met by many obstacles and a kindly priest, enrolls in a junior college and makes good enough grades to get into N.D. <br />Once there, he tries out for the football team, is kept around for four years as a &quot;tackling dummy,&quot; but due to his popularity on the team and among the student body, new coach Dan Devine fulfills old coach Ara Parseghian's promise to let him play a few minutes. Rudy even makes a tackle during garbage time of a game against Michigan State.<br />Director David Anspaugh (&quot;Hoosiers&quot;) focuses on the character development of Angelo Pizzo's screenplay. The story is predictable (being true it was not easy to hide), but that matters less than Astin's inspired gullibility. Charles Dutton is terrific as the stadium groundskeeper, and Ned Beatty is great as his dad. <br />Look, if you hate Notre Dame, this film will probably make you sick, but if you can at least tolerate the mythology for a couple hours, &quot;Rudy&quot; is one of the better sports movies of recent years.

B00013PHGS|5.0|Although I loved \\"10,000 Hz Legend\\" it was much, much different than \\"Moon Safari\\" and some were disappointed by it. I guess when \\"Talkie Walkie\\" was released I had no idea at all what to expect from Air this time around. But boy have they created a masterpiece. To me \\"Talkie Walkie\\" lands somewhere between \\"Moon Safari\\" and \\"10,000 Hz\\". It is beauitul and mellow and yet has an electro vibe, if you will, to it and feels completely fresh and new. This is not to be missed by anyone who loved \\"Moon Safari\\". Every track is simply amazing, especailly songs like \\"Surfing on a Rocket\\" and \\"Cherry Blossom Girl.\\"
0380713802|5.0|I picked this book up on a whim. I found myself near the Travel section and it just called my attention. I had been wanting to get a travel memoir for a while, so I decided to follow my instinct and buy it and read it immediately. I am very glad I did.<br />Bryson's memoirs of his trip through Europe are incredibly funny and poignant. Interspersed throughout the narrative are stories from a 1972 trip he took with a &quot;friend&quot; named Stephen Katz which help to bring modern Europe into focus. Bryson, who at the time was living in England though he is American, has a bit of a &quot;best of both worlds&quot; kind of vision, which makes him able to see Europeans on their own terms, so to speak. The book covers a lot of ground, as Bryson travels from Scandinavia, through the usual staples of Western Europe, and ends up on the fringes of Europe, in Yugoslavia, Bulgaria and Istanbul. Some of the places he visits I have visited myself, and in those cases it was fun to see how we each experienced the city (I am happy to report we share our opinion of Naples, namely Ugh!) and/or country; in those cases where he goes to places I have never been (and there are quite a few those), the fun is in both his stories and just the sheer fun of travel. As I said, Bryson is funny in a candid way; he has no problem telling you about how many times he got drunk, or the various times he gets completely taken for a fool, always with wit and humor. Travel memoirs usually include these little details, factoids, that make the places come alive, and Bryson, though not a scholar and not a travel guidebook writer, injects quite a few of them in, always with an eye to bring the destination to life through history and context. In the end, however, the book is excellent because it is a very heartfelt and honest travel memoir that takes you along as a companion. Anyone who has ever traveled can relate to it, especially if you have visited Europe and can chuckle silently (or loudly, as I did too many times to count) when you remember all those little quirks that are quintessentially European. On a personal level, memoirs like this help me to bring into focus my own trip to Europe, going on three years ago, and remind me of the joy of travel, of the joy of seeing new lands, of the joy of coming home ready to do it all, all over again. And that is something that I appreciate immensely.ny times to count) when you remember all those little quirks that are quintessentially European.

1565117808|4.0|...in that there are more talented wordsmiths out there but just like the Celestine Prophecy, I had trouble putting it down. Definitely worth a read and the message about belief and faith will stick with me for a long time.  Many of the images will stay with me for a very long time.
0385512104|5.0|This is a terrific book.  The main character is one of the quirkiest you'll encounter, however you come to identify with him and cheer him on.  His autistic world view starts to make more sense than the normal world view of those people around him.  Plus there are diagrams, and he explains the &quot;Let's Make A Deal&quot; door selection dilemma so I finally got it!  What more could you want in a book?
B000002JSR|3.0|Released after Zeppelin's breakup, Coda is still credited as a full length album even though all of the songs were outtakes. What makes this worse is that most of the good outtakes had been used already on Physical Graffiti. That's why half of the songs were ones that did not make it on In Through the Out Door. \\"We're Gonna Grove\\" sounds good and the live version of \\"I Can't Quit You Baby\\" is even better than the original version; probably because of more guitar solos and better riffs by Page. Bonzo's Montreux is like \\"Moby Dick\\" except that it is all John Bonham playing his \\"Drum Orchestra,\\" with only added electronic effectsd by Page. \\"Wearing and Tearing\\" should have been put on In Through the Out Door instead of \\"Hot Dog.\\" \\"Poor Tom\\" is only okay, and all of the rest of the songs were easy to tell why they were left off. This should probably be the last Zeppelin album anyone should buy and will only be appreciated by die-hard Zeppelin fans.
B0000BWVCM|4.0|Having followed the X-Men thru the 70's and 80's, I had to see this movie sometime.  I got it on DVD recently, and despite being baffled by the multitude of scenes filled with hollow writing, and basic film and character flaws, it is SO enjoyable to watch a dozen times or more because of the strength of the film, action and characters.  This might be one of the few non-turkey films that is technically flawed in story and storytelling, but just DARN enjoyable to see again and again.  The designs, acting, colors and movement are so enticing.  On the negative tho, let me present a few notes...<br />First, the entire plot for the film is faulty.  It isn't devastatingly faulty because it plays in forward motion, but falls apart as you back up.  Basically, Stryker made this alternate Cerebro to kill all mutants...why did he have to get Nightcrawler to attack the president?  Why did he need to invade the Mansion??  He could have just said 'Its complete, lets get Xavier and call it a day.'  HOW did Stryker get a hold of Kurt Wagner?!  Its just a mess of implausible, less then pragmatic reasoning.  They wrote the White House scenes only to make symmetrical 'book ends' for the writing - president's office scenes of error and correction.<br />Over all, a lot of scenes had nothing more behind them then what they were.  In terms of writing, this is death, and it made the movie tedious to me.  What this means is that there was no crafty subtext, subreason, sub anything to most scenes.  A lot of scequences were exactly what they were, sometimes merely injected as ways to explain how the world works, but not how the story works.  Examples - Bobby Drake's house, the President's house, the fight in the Adamantium room, the plane fight.  <br />Much footwork!  So many scenes/sequences were so poorly thought out.  Nightcrawler grabs Rogue from outside of a moving plane and bamfs back in...yet has trouble bamfing through a 1 foot door at the end.  They layered up that drama all wrong, tho the Nightcrawler/Storm faith vs. eyes stuff was nice.  The writers should have made the Kurt/Ororo sequence some gradiose, tricky maneuver of multiple bamfs.  Why did they go to Bobby Drakes house??  Whats this about?  Why'd the kid call the cops??  Horrid motivation all over this sequence.  I hated all the footwork in the end.  Kurt can teleport, so why wasn't he zapping people all over?  Why was Rogue flying the jet??  Why is Styrker one moment under the jet doubled up in pain, then suddenly he's taking a nice little coffee break as Magneto approaches??  Why did Logan have to carry the kid?  Why did they have to walk over to Stryker chained up?  Why didn't they have Jean stop the water from getting them as they ran TO the plane instead of her stepping OUT of the plane???  Then, her skitish powers give out as the plane rises...she dies....simple.  Instead, they write an 'apology' sequence, after, where Xavier mysteriously explains she 'made a choice'.  She's a dummy, basically.  Why they had Iceman in this show at all was a huge mystery, and why didn't he turn to ice when activating powers?  Instead of Jean leaving the plane and dying in the water, Iceman should have frozen the water so they could fly out.  Simple.  Why didn't the film creatives think of this?  Even a cheap Rogue, 'oops I knocked him out with a victory kiss,' would have been fine and then set up inner conflict in Rogue, who let Jean die, for the next film.  I assume Bobby Drake was only here to provide the obligatory, Hollywood LOVE STORY deemed necessary to any high budget movie.  This film was really about walking, not about the trials and tribulations of super powered weirdos.<br />Lastly, the main characters went OUT of character so often.  Basically, Wolverine and Scott Summers.  These two are the primary engine of conflict within the X-men, and should be very carefully portrayed.  Wolverine should be a gruff jerk, a real spikey character who is mostly self centered and motivated as much forhis own reasons as for his team.  While not a bad guy, he is a dangerous person, and not someone anyone would call pleasant.  Scott Summers is the nice white boy who sees himself as, and is granted, the lead of the team.  He gives commands, he organizes, he uses logic and strategy, and sums up situations.  Scott isn't very pleasant either, because he puts up walls between himself and everyone else, aside from the Professor and Jean; both whom he loves dearly for different reasons.  His whole motive and personality was never well established.  The kind of pedastal he puts the prof. on isn't shown properly, nor the pressures of his walls making him NEED Jean as a buffer for his emotional burdens from holding together a group of oddball elements in dedication to his idol/father figure, professor X.  Wolverine changes personality within every scene as he goes from 'nice guy around the house' to 'gruff baddie' for no real reason.  Wolverine should never say 'Thanks', 'Hows it going?' or 'Hey kiddo'....too nice.  He is an aggressive character that is always in the way, brutish and demanding, as well as rudely unappreciative in most situations.<br />There.  I liked a lot of the effects work!  It is a very rewatchable film for me.  I saw it 12 times so far (most times playing in the background).  While the basic ideas are fun, it is fairly hollow.  The charm comes from the use of the powers and character interactions at the best of times.  Some writing is really nicely thought out, but overall it feels like a script and idea put through a paper shredder and then taped together to make work.
B0000029AL|3.0|This self-titled album is the debut for Aerosmith, and you can tell from the first song that they were going to be something special. This album boasts good songs with great riffs. The only downside is that for some reason Steven Tyler for whatever reason does not sing with his characterist screaming. He instead seems so laid back that his vocals don't go with Joe Perry's guitar playing. &quot;Mama Kin&quot; is good, but is much better live, with Steven's normal voice. Of course, &quot;Dream On&quot; is the first power ballad with the distorted sounds of keyboards and guitars. Overall, a better than average debut, but did not change the face of rock yet.
6300208699|2.0|It will be difficalt to advise other film fans about the MAGIC CHRISTIAN.  It isn't like many other movies. It doesn't have a linear plot.  It wasn't made with great attention to production values.  It seems to have been shot wildly - for fun - and then brought back for sorting out in the editing room.  It is steeped in a bygone culture no one practices anymore (if they ever did).<BR>But I find it interesting sometimes to see what other people do with a movie camera. Like a guilty pleasure, I like it even though I admitt it isn't &quot;good&quot;. I like the way it makes you question the value of &quot;good&quot;.There are a few funny jokes and a theme but I guess I like it becuase it isn't like many other films, has no linear plot, was shot wildly as if for fun, ignores production values and is steeped in a bygone culture that no one practices anymore, if in fact they ever did. <BR>Worth a look if you're into film and have an open mind. <br />Two stars for conventional merit - four stars for being cool with the two stars.<BR>&quot;Come and get it&quot;
0316666343|3.0|As this book was the No. 1 best seller at the time when i bought it, i naturally had a high expectation. However, after reading I was utterly disappointed at the story that was not really what I would call intriguing at all. Narrated by a girl named Susie Salmon, a gifted, attractive, innocent, good-natured country girl, dearly beloved by friends and family. she was tragically raped and murdered by mentally perverted neighbor, Mr. Harvey, and went to heaven. Thus began her narration of her families, friends, and classmates' lives on earth as they lived on, grew older, adapt to her absence and slowly unraveled the mystery to her death. The characters, first of all, like Susie and Lindsey, were   beautiful, intelligent, lovable little girls who were basically perfect. I found these characters quite severely lacking originality and reality, and quite similar to characters in stories written by some middle-school girl. Then there was the overly predictable plot of the book. It is such a shame because the initial idea of having a dead person narrate stories on earth was actually creative (surprise!) and had it been better developed would have made this a more worthwhile read.
B000002KBU|1.0|i read the reviews of people who bought this and said buy this cd it's great and i went out and did it and i regret doing it after listening to this cd i can understand why no radio stations play her music in my city not 1 station.her voice is really awful.and the music is enough to put anyone to sleep.you wanna hear good folk music listen to love's forever changes or the kink's 68 masterpiece village green preservation society.this is the last time i go by other people.i can see why less and less people even know who joni mitchell is anymore.like her fans she is a dying breed.
B00005JLZN|5.0|This movie has flawless acting and really leaves you saying WOW!!!   The movie has a great message that is still argued about today, the death penalty.   There is allways two sides to the story this movie deals with alittle bit of both you have to see the movie to see what happens it's worth it trust me.   At first I didn't want to see this movie because my girlfriend rented it and I assumed it was a ckick flick I was wrong real wrong.   It's a well made movie with great actors across the board.   Like I said the leaves you feeling satisfied.   A must see!!
B00005JMJ4|5.0|The thing about this movie is that is just about life and how two people deal with a situation.  There is no revelation or humangous theme that comes from it, its just life.  I think it is a very good movie and could definitely be difficult to appreciate for some.  Overall this was a very good movie.
B000002BFZ|4.0|Upon listening to this album the other day I noticed something strange about the album's design.  There are 13 songs on the album, but only 9 polaroid pictures containing song lyrics in the sleeve of my cd.  I noticed that it was 'Who You Are', 'In My Tree', 'Lukin', and 'I'm Open' that had been excluded.  This made me think that the album in its original incarnation was only intended to have nine songs, and the four songs omitted from my collection had been added only after the cover art had already been designed.  Given that 'Who You Are' and 'In My Tree' have a heavy asian influence, 'Lukin' sounds like it was written in 5 minutes, and 'I'm Open' is a spoken word disaster, this is very possible.  The main criticism of this album was that it was a haphazard unorganized mess. This is true, but given a better running order where the songs don't get progressively worse, the original nine songs could be put together nicely since they all (besides mankind) have a common theme: the mixture of pearl jam's rage with the distorted folk of Neil Young. 'Off he goes', 'Smile', and especially 'Red Mosquito' are the best examples of this new sound, while 'Hail Hail' and 'Habit' rock as hard as any of their previous work.  The key to these songs though, is that they demonstrate that pearl jam was finally capable of merging strong melodies into their trademark aggressive sound.  'Who You Are' and 'In My Tree', while not only being two of the best songs of the album,  but of their entire career, do not fit well at all.  Neither does 'I'm Open', the worst Pearl Jam song ever released (well besides 'Hey Foxymophandlemama' and half of the mess on 'Lost Dogs').  'I'm Open' and 'Present Tense' experiment with replacing drums and rhythm guitars with open ambience, and it sounds terrible.  Obviously Pearl Jam wanted to try some new things with this CD, and when they succeed(ie 'Red Mosquito'), they show why they were the most popular rock band throughout the nineties.  However, they alsoshow that can fall flat on their face with half-baked ideas and songs they probably can't admit to even liking (ie 'Around the Bend', 'I'm Open', 'Present Tense').  It's a shame they listened to the critics though, since 'Yield', while being a much more consistent cd, has no song that is half as good as the best songs on this album.
B00005UW9T|4.0|When I first saw it in the theaters, I fell asleep. I'm not sure if the movie got to boring, or if I was just tired. But anyways, on to the movie:<br />Story: Anastasia, her grandmother, and the rest of the Romanov family are enjoying a royal ball in their palace. But alas, there's always a bad guy,.......Rasputin in this case. He says that Anastasia's whole family will die soon, and that happens (off screen of course). Well, everybody except for Anastasia and her grandma. Her grandma escapes to Paris. &quot;Anya&quot; falls off a train, hits her head, and ends up in an orphanage. 10 years later, two conmen named Dimitri and Vladamer are &quot;collecting&quot; girls that look/act like Anastasia. This is because Marie (Anya's grandma) is holding a grand reward of 10 million rubels for anyone who finds her lost granddaughter. And Anastasia? She is finally released from the orphanage. But instead of going &quot;fishing&quot; like the lady at the orphanage tells her to, she goes to St. Petersburg to find her family. Following her is the undead Rasputin (ha, and you thought he was dead). He's trying to get revenge since Anya lived. The rest of the story follows the journey's of Anastasia, and how she finds her grandmama. <br />As for the historical record? Well, Rasputin was actually a &quot;friend of the family&quot; as you might call him. He helped to cure little Alex, Anastasia's brother, from a fever. From what I've heard, I guess Anya's whole family (including her) was killed. Not a very happy ending is it? Of course, they can't let the kids know this, so it's all &quot;re-arranged&quot;. As for Pooka (the dog), who knows if the Romanov family had a dog or not. Dimitri? He looks suspiciously like Alex dosn't he? And what about Bartok (the bat)? Of course, he is purely fictional. I have to admit that he seemed like the main character more than Anya, since he had the most &quot;personality&quot;. Kind of a cute little guy actually. <br />Overall, it's fun, cute, and whimsicall. Sounds like a kids movie dosn't it? That's because it is!! But all in all, I think you'd enjoy it.

0060555661|3.0|Classic investment book. However, each chapter in this edition is followed by a chapter of commentary by a journalist. I found this annoying and would have preferred an appendix with the information. The content of those additional chapters makes for some interesting reading but doesn't sit well between Graham's original chapters, in my view.
0385510438|5.0|I've read all the novels John Grisham has written. I have liked some better better than others, but THE LAST JUROR reeled me in from the beginning. The protaganist is believable, and it is neat to watch him find his voice as he interacts with the residents in a small town. Grisham is meddling in &quot;social history&quot;--he hits class issues, civil rights, gun control, the buying habits of  small town USA, and on and on.<br />He  has a disclaimer about certain Mississippi/Ford county laws with which he took liberty, but on page 114, he has the first Italians in Ford county loaded into 1904 Ford Model T's at the railroad station. Oops. The first Model T's were built in 1908.<br />I'm glad that John, like Willie, has made lots of money doing what he likes to do. Now he has the resources to do a little experimenting. In my opinion, Grisham is never a dull read!
B00009V7PJ|5.0|I was actually there in Miami for this taping.  Cher put on quite a show.  But it was that, a show.  Perfectly orchestrated, Cirque du Soleil style.  Very perfect and calculated and rehearsed, down to every line she said.<br />But the real concert was the opening act, Cyndi Lauper.  She sounded amazing combining her old-time hits with her new songs.  Running through the audience and shaking hands with them, singing into people's cell phones.  By the time she started hitting stratospheric high notes during extended rendition of &quot;Money Changes Everything&quot;, everybody was on their feet, screaming in ecstasy.<BR>What a concert!  Who needs dancers and special effects when you have the best voice in Pop music, a kick-ass band and enough energy to electrify a stadium.  BTW, she's taping her own concert on March 11 in NYC.  I can't wait for that one to be released.[...]<br />Oh! and about the Madonna argument.  Cher did have another #1 with &quot;I Got You Babe&quot;.  And Mariah Carey has 16 #1 hits which beat Madonna's 12.  Diana Ross has 18 but twelve of those are credited to The Supremes.  And as for sales in the US, Barbra Streissand is the number one seller with over 71.5 million  albums sold beating Madonna's 60 million.  Worldwide Madonna most likely is the winner, though.<BR>Madonna is amazing for many reasons.  You have to compare apples to apples.  Cher has an Oscar to her name and hosted a top TV show for years.  I don't think Madonna could ever do that.
B00005YW4H|5.0|I just got the new Norah Jones album, \\"Feels Like Home\\" and I have to say I really like it. I wasn't always a huge fan of hers at first but I heard the album was really good and worth the buy. I agree; I enjoyed it a lot. It's very relaxing and definitely a good CD to just throw on at work or while driving home and unwinding. My favorite track off the album is \\"Those Sweet Words.\\" I liked the way the vocals and piano were in synch.....it reminded me a lot of \\"Don't Know Why,\\" which I always liked hearing on the radio. A friend also lent me their copy of 2 other CDs that Norah was on (I had never even known they existed). I listened and LOVED those tracks as well. If anyone is interested, the other CDs are \\"New York City\\" and \\"Chance and Circumstance\\" (they are actually listed on Amazon if you search for &quot;Norah.&quot; My 2 favorites from those other CDs are \\"New York City\\" and \\"Heart of Mine.\\" The jazz and blues style they had is amazing and I think I'm going to order a copy of them for my own CD collection as well.

0385504209|4.0|I am a christian man and I found this a very good read. I know there are a lot of reviewers bombing this book due to its content. That is only due to the fact people cannot seperate Fiction and NON-Fiction.  Dan Brown is a excellent researcher and he is masterful in the way he ties facts together to wield a truly good read. So decide for yourself. Thumbs up on my personal book of the month :)
0385504209|3.0|The Da Vinci Code is one of those books that would make a much better movie. In fact, as a high school aged reader, I found myself picturing a movie during the whole time I was reading the book. So, when I found out that a film based on Dan Brown's novel was going to be made into a movie, directed by Ron Howard, I couldn't have been more pleased. I will be excited to see the movie version of the book because the book had a terrific plot, but sadly, it lagged in parts from the monotonous writing of Dan Brown. The movie could make up for that major weakness in the book.<br />The Da Vinci code starts out extremely compelling. The curator of the Louvre in Paris has been killed by an unknown assailant and the police are after Harvard professor Robert Langdon because a code next to his dead body says, \\"O, Draconian Devil! Oh, lame saint! P.S. Find Robert Langdon.\\" Robert Langdon and a cryptologist, Sophie Neveu, are then racing against an enemy to find out a secret that a group, The Priory of Sion, have been hiding from the world for hundreds of years.<br />Parts of this book are actually very well done. One could clearly picture the characters and they seemed like real people. I also enjoyed the clues and word puzzles as they were very well done and challenging to figure out. The book raised some interesting topics about the bible, Mary Magdalene, and the Holy Grail. The book also had many plot twists and so one never knew what was coming next.<br />While reading the book, it seemed to me that the author ran out of steam about two thirds of the way through. Dan Brown includes chapters on events as pointless to the plot as Langdon and Neveu going to a library. To me, this is a sign he was just trying to fill up space. The book has some very interesting information, some of which is made up by the author and some of which is based on fact. But one has a hard time believing the facts that the author does have information to support because the facts are mixed in with a great deal of fiction.eat deal of fiction.
B00005JMCN|4.0|SEABISCUIT was a very good \\"movie-movie\\" with an underdog theme and I'd recommend it to anyone, but it wasn't without flaws.  I don't want to seem to \\"dwell on the flaws\\" -- this IS a four-star review, after all -- but this review will highlight and coalesce some of the less admirable aspects of this expensive, high-production movie because so many others have sung its praise so commendably.  This isn't a pan--just one consumer's viewpoint who has seen the film both in theater and twice on DVD with bells and whistles.<br />The acting was noteworthy.  At the least, convincing (Jeff Bridges as the title horse's owner, Tobey Maguire as Seabiscuit's gentle jockey); and at best illuminating: Annette Bening as the Bridges' character's first wife, who had to carry a lot of the emotional baggage left over from a highly truncated first third of Laura Hillenbrand's bestselling nonfiction book, on which this movie is based.<br />Leaving out of the movie such not-so-minor historical details as the San Francisco earthquake (which proved the validity of the panic-proof Horseless Carriage and made a millionaire out of Jeff Bridges' character, Buick franchisor for the West Coast), SEABISCUIT as briskly as possible establishes the rags-to-riches biography of the man who made his fortune selling cars--and then, ironically and much like Henry Ford, developed a taste for the idyllic and bought himself a huge estate and became a gentleman squire of horseflesh.<br />It isn't easy to do in a standard-length movie what Hillenbrand's massive book did, which is underline the synergy that took place when owner, trainer and jockey all collaborated to rehabilitate the \\"impossible\\" Seabiscuit, a \\"runty\\" horse, built all wrong and raised to bring out his violent temper.  (Seabiscuit was Man O'War's grandson, but on the wrong side of the bloodline.)  So now, the truly interesting phase begins, the underdog (underhorse?) saga--think of Seabiscuit as a kind of equine Rocky.<br />Unfortunately, the movie has to haul out the ol' Hollywood Duck Tape to bring the three guys together convincingly, in essence putting Tobey Maguire's character through seven or eight hellish years of surviving the Depression by racing, roundabouting, and fighting bare-knuckles....but then to backtrack in calendar years, creating a sci-fi type \\"time anomaly.\\"  [I can almost hear some stereotype of a 1940s studio exec hollering \\"Where's the love interest?\\"]<br />To accommodate the romantic angle and introduce the owner's courtship of his second wife, and to provide background info for the Depression (for which I am grateful), some number-cooking ensued.  At the point where jockey and owner meet, the plot from the jockey's point of view should have landed him in about 1937, but the movie tells us it's 1934.  Which it must be, according to the conventions of Hollywood Logic; what we're told is true, but the time anomaly results from the script's (or more accurately, the abbreviation of script's) painting the plot in a corner, logic-wise.  In all fairness, Hillenbrand, lacking the restraints of the 100-page screenplay, had the space to tell the real story from multiple points of view and so the numbers add up just as they did in real life.  So while I must give the film five gold stars for good civic intentions and solid acting (and more to kiss than a horse), it gets held back in primary for failure to achieve in elementary arthithmetic.<br />Other not-too-subtle signs of condescension toward a mass audience are at hand, the kind we DIDN'T see in the truly top-notch underdog \\"Gladiator\\" or \\"Rocky.\\"  SEABISCUIT leaned a bit much on Hollywood overproduction to puff itself up.  This is such an utterly compelling story that even with the occasional glitch it would have sold better understated than without Randy Newman's (or his assistant's) plebian background music, which made every meadow a vista, every emphasis an epiphany, every awakening an orgasm.  Too many carefully inserted \\"ta-daa\\" moments signaled by music or quick cuts that condescended to the audience, a pity in a film derived from a book that earned plenty of real \\"ta-daa's.\\"<br />There is, however, one time-saving plot device which is utterly charming.  It's pure fiction and I don't care.  Kudos plus to the invented (NOT composite) character played by William H. Macy of tipsy radio sportscaster \\"Tick-Tock\\" McLoughlin, who broadcasts his own special blend of pixillated pony wisdom and thoroughbred blarney from a tiny studio with a host of noisemakers and musical instruments and the occasional help of a very bored girlfriend.  (If you've seen BULL DURHAM you know the potential the blind eye of radio holds for fabricting faux \\"on-site\\" events.)  Much welcome comedy relief that advanced the plot without my really knowing it.  Not to digress, but is Mr. Macy ever in a bad movie??<br />I personally think SEABISCUIT is an asset to any family.  Anecdotal DVD material is okay, nothing amazing.  Visual transfer is fine, aural copy is just OK.  I for one found that irritating earwash of not-quite-wall-to-wall background music annoying, especially during the false crescendoes; when I set the home theater receiver (and I have a cheap one) for U-shaped (ampitheater/surround) playback, it wasn't so annoying and blarey.<br />Seabiscuit his ownself was a no-bull horse.  Despite the fact that the film comes equipped with some gratuitous bullfeathers, it's still well worth experiencing, and more than once.erted \\"ta-daa\\" moments signaled by music or quick cuts that condescended to the audience, a pity in a film derived from a book that earned plenty of real \\"ta-daa's.\\"  <br />There is, however, one time-saving plot device which is utterly charming.

B00006AFUR|5.0|30 seconds to mars is still an awesome band, and this cd hasn't gotten old yet. It will always be a great buy. There aren't any songs on this cd that I am sick of at all yet, and I can listen to the whole thing through without skipping past a song. So buy it... k.
B000084T18|4.0|50 Cent's album may not exactly be a work of genius, but it's been ruling the hip-hop dancefloors for well over a year.  His songs consistently have bumping beats and a solid lyrical flow.  Between the witty punchlines and the great production, this is an album you can enjoy when you want to get pumped for a night out.  If you want thought-inspiring, innovative music, though, stay away from this album.  <br />My only complaint is that there's a lack of variation in the subject matter, even by gangsta rap standards.  Every track is just about how he's going to shoot you and how he's really not kidding about it.

B00005OM4Q|5.0|This movie, along with &quot;High Fidelity,&quot; is good to show to anyone who might wonder why music is the central focus of your life!  Most people my age (33) stopped listening to and following music when they left high school, but this movie is genius in showing why music still matters and will always matter for myself.  The scene where his sister is leaving home to the strains of S &amp; G's &quot;America&quot; is a priceless example of the power songs can have.  On this extended DVD, the extra footage enhances an already excellent movie, the Stillwater CD is a sweet touch, and the bonus features, including the commentary, add substantially to the mix.  This is one of those DVD's to get lost in for a weekend, a trip back in time to when music really MATTERED, before videos and celebrity stole the soul.  Don't worry about the higher pricetag here; every dollar is worth it!!

You SHOULD buy this, if you want to have a complete DVD collection (and I mean it, he was a BEATLE!!!)
0671027344|5.0|I'm almost afraid to admit how much I related to this book. Like the main character of Charlie, I've always been withdrawn and reluctant to take the spotlight, prefering to keep a &quot;low profile.&quot; But reading this book makes me realize how much you're missing out to live like that. To quote a line from the film, Adaptation, &quot;You're not who loves you, you're who YOU LOVE!&quot; In other words, it's all about what YOU can give in this life, how much love YOU can give. This book, more than any other, made me realize that. Please read it and don't waste your life! Thanks also to the guy who recommended The Losers' Club by Richard Perez
0060930187|5.0|\\"The Bell Jar\\" introduces us to a college-aged woman who spends a month of her summer vacation in New York City, all the while working at a magazine and attending events with a group of other girls from this summer program.  She is somewhat of an outsider, perpetually waiting for something more.  In the novel she describes waiting for the mystery of New York City to rub off on her, but she can never seem to find it.  We learn of her continual disenchantment with relationships and the potential for relationships.  There is a continual feeling that she's slightly off-axis from everyone and everything else -- not in terms of any mental instability, but more that she cannot resign herself to be like the average girl her age or find herself fulfilled by anything superficial.  As the novel progresses she becomes even more disconnected, as an effect of her mental degradation.<br />It's a wonderfully well-written book, and it definitely held my interest. One of the difficult things about this novel is that it tends to over-saturate in certain age groups. And this caused me to have a somewhat distorted presumption about it prior to reading it. I enjoyed it, but it wasn't quite the \\"descent into madness\\" I was expecting.  Though I've found this the case with other novels I have read as well, such as \\"Girl, Interrupted\\".  The insanity doesn't quite seem so abnormal.  Though that is definitely subjective.  I did, however, appreciate how honest and realistic the novel is.  (Granted, the protagonist obviously isn't far from the author's reach.)  So while it may not have been as intense as I had hoped, it was certainly satisfying.  In fact, the more I think about it after having finished it, the more satified I become with it; the way Plath crafted this book really leaves a lasting impression on you.<br />Overall, I would certainly recommend this book.  Plath has an excellent style of writing that can be very sutble, yet quickly draws you in.  While I haven't read many novels dealing with this subject, I would recommend \\"The Bell Jar\\" over \\"Girl, Interrupted\\" in terms of the former's ability to really bring the reader into the mind of the \\"insane\\".
0385504209|3.0|The topic of this book was new to me, but I found it absolutely fascinating and eye-opening (the only reason for the 3 stars)! I immediately went out and bought some informational books on the Priory of Scion and the premise of the Holy Grail. If this book had been about some other fictional topic, I would have put it down after the first few pages. The murder mystery plot was predictable and the &quot;leave-you-hanging&quot; endings to every chapter got old quickly (especially with the large number of chapters in this book). The speed at which this fast-paced mystery and its cryptographic puzzles was solved was completely unbelievable and, quite frankly, insulting. Admittedly, I did find the Epilogue alittle surprising, but nothing else caught me offguard. I'm not one for reading murder mysteries, but because this came so highly recommended by many, I did. Now I've confirmed for myself why I won't be reading anymore.
B00007BH3Y|5.0|I find it rare when a score really catches my attention while watching a film.  Philip Glass creates an absolutely beautiful and haunting score, which is wonderfully appropriate for this film.  I've been a fan of Glass' work for years, and I would count this among his best.  He captures the differing moods of the film perfectly.  And while intense, the score does not over-shadow the film, but compliments it perfectly; the score itself is able to tell the story of the film.  &quot;The Hours&quot; is predominantly composed for the piano, violin, and cello, which leaves it free of being over-burdened and heavy.  This also allows the music to be extremely fluid, which is an important element in the cohesion of the film (with respect to the three overlapping plot lines).<br />Furthermore, unlike some film scores, when you listen to &quot;The Hours&quot;, you're not consumed by the emotion of the film, but you're made very aware of it.  I make the differentiation, because a score like &quot;Requiem for a Dream&quot; easily puts you into an intense emotional state, practically throwing you into that despair.  But with &quot;The Hours&quot;, that emotion is present, but it doesn't burden the experience of listening to the score.<br />I would higly recommend this to anyone -- even if you're not a fan of Philip Glass, this is different from many of his other works (specifically film scores).
0380789019|3.0|This story was built with a rich imagination.  I loved reading about what odd scenario the characters would find themselves in next.  It was clever, interesting, and quite a page turner.  The characters, however, especially Richard and Door, were too shallow.  I never took to them the way I wanted to.  I didn't long for their success.  Door had so much potential, but the details just never came out, and Richard, well he was mostly a doofus.  If this author could make us really care for the characters, this would be world-class storytelling.
B0000DZEA1|5.0|Soundtracks do not make or mar a film per se, but it cannot be denied that it is an important element. An irritating or faky soundtrack can make you laugh at what should be a serious part of the film, and would probably draw your attention away from the actual movie.<br />  But then sometimes there are those soundtracks that come along that the listener just really likes. It captures the emotion of the film, it can deliver a mighty punch when necessary, but also presents softer parts where they are required. In short, it fits. This is what Howard Shore has done with the Return of the King soundtrack.<br />  Featuring the masterful voices of Ben del Maestro, who had previously worked on the Two Towers soundtrack, Annie Lennox, and Renee Flemming of opera fame, as well as the wonderful London Philharmonic, The London Voices, and The London Oratory School Sola, this soundtrack takes us on a third journey into Howard Shore's music of Middle Earth.<br />  Beginning with a harmless, happy flashback depicting Deagol and Smeagol fishing on the Anduin River, the music is joyous, and somewhat reminiscent of the Shire tunes that featured in the other soundtracks. But before many minutes have passed, the music rapidly descends into a thunderous blend of the two Mordor themes, reminding everyone that the enemy is not defeated yet.<br />  Soon after, we are introduced to a theme that was not in either of the other soundtracks: the motif of Gondor, the mightiest nation of men still extant in Middle Earth. The loud brass music here is sure to remind everyone of the theme for the Fellowship, but it still has its own sound to it, and it well depicts the honor and hope that still lives on in Gondor.<br />  There is another new theme here, encapsulated in one long track, that has not been heard in previous soundtracks, simply because the loathsome creature it portrays has not showed herself before: the theme for Shelob. Starting off with slow, ominous brass depicting her dark lair, it soon kicks off with racing violins as she begins her quest for blood. This is not a track to skip-it doesn't let up much at all, once it gets going.<br />  Just as choral music featured prominently in Two Towers and the Fellowship, it has a key role in the Return of the King as well. It marshalls itself chiefly into two incredible tracks-The Battle of the Pelennor Fields and The End of All Things. In Pelennor we have a variant of the Nazgul theme-a little less subtle than the one we're used to. The pounding chorus here may very well be my favorite part of the entire CD. Did I talk about no letup in Shelob's tune? Try this one.<br />  The End of All Things is another great track-since it depicts the final climax of the film, it has to be pretty dramatic, and it certainly is. This features the excellent voice of Renee Flemming in the quieter parts, and shows that this lady does not need to stick to opera to sound good.<br />  There is one track-only one, mind you-that I am not very enamored with in this CD, and I think it may simply be because the scene it accompanies is one I dislike. This track depicts one of the mercifully rare appearances of Arwen Evenstar in the film-and probably is not intrisically bad music. I think I'm just prejudiced. If you liked Arwen, you'll probably like this.<br />  Shore does something unusual in this soundtrack-two separate actors in the film have small singing parts. One-Billy Boyd's song in track 5, the Steward of Gondor-is quite excellent. The other-Viggo Mortensen's solo in track 17, The Return of the King-is not. Mortensen should have kept just to speaking, but his part is only about thirty seconds to a minute out of a ten-minute, otherwise very good track, so it is not too bad.<br />  And then there is always the final track: Into the West. Annie Lennox give us an emotional, very good song about the final destination of all the good guys in Middle Earth--the western land of Valinor, which seems to be Tolkien's allegory of Heaven.This is an excellent song, and Annie Lennox has a very good voice.<br />  The Return of the King is a wonderful end to a wonderful soundtrack, with recaptions of many of the excellent themes that made appearances in the other two CDs-the Fellowship theme and the Rohan theme, chiefly. With its epic scope and wonderful performers, it is a great soundtrack for a great movie, and is nearly as good standing on its own as it is accompanying the movie. Don't pass it by.allegory of Heaven.

B0000C9ZLD|2.0|Listen. The Strokes have talent. Some of the guitars here are great, if formulaic, and sweet. I've seen The Strokes live and both guitar dudes know what the hell they're doin'. Moving on, though, the bass player is incredibly inept, and Julian Casablancas is quick to get on nerves with that grating voice of his.<br />I must say that &quot;Reptilia&quot; is one of the best rock songs I've heard in a long, long, LONG time. It gave my rating the extra star to make it two (**). That's about all this album has going for it, however, and that should be frowned upon. Listen, &quot;Reptilia&quot; was recently released as a CD single. Buy that instead, and save a few bucks.<br />The Strokes are NOT the saviors of rock 'n roll. Some of you have mentioned The White Stripes. They aren't saviors either, but I'll tell you one thing, they're better than The Strokes.<br />But hey, &quot;Reptilia&quot; 's good.

B0000DJZ7W|5.0|The last few years have been a roller coaster for Celine Dion, and her music of late seems to reflect that - she's released dance tunes, ballads, and even jazz classics. However, Celine returns to her roots on &quot;1 Fille &amp; 4 Types&quot; with songs that are not only in her native French, but beautiful tracks.<br />You don't have to understand the language to appreciate the tunes contained on this album. They are all very much alive, and there is distinct emotion communicated in each. To write about each one would take more time and room than either of us have patience for, so here are the highlights:<br />'Je Lui Dirai': The first time I heard this song, I fell in love with it. The story of a mother telling her child about his family and the world around him, it is at once light, catchy, and a beautiful track.<br />'Je t'Aime Encore': Celine recorded the English version of this acoustic gem on her last album, &quot;One Heart&quot;, and she treats fans to a French - language version on this album. In many ways, the song sounds better in French, and the delicacy of the mood is even more evident in this language.<br />'Ne Bouge Pas': I never thought I would hear Celine Dion singing something resembling country music in French, but in 'Ne Bouge Pas', she does just that. It's a fun track to sing along to, with relatively easy lyrics to learn and a catchy refrain.<br />'Retiens - Moi': Sounding like something you would normally hear from an artist like Jewel, 'Retiens - Moi' is a warm, acoustic song with a beautiful melody and lyrics.<br />'Valse Adieu': A bonus track on this album, 'Valse Adieu' ('Goodbye Waltz') is a beautiful track, ballad-like but with acoustic guitar. NOTE: It is not listed on the album's tracklist, but Amazon has included it on theirs.<br />Overall, this album is a great new sound for Celine. She has toned down the powerful vocals she has been performing in ballads for years, yet it's much tamer than her more recent dance albums. I highly recommend &quot;1 Fille &amp; 4 Types&quot; to anyone who enjoys beautiful, relaxing music. This one's not full of studio magic - there's just a great voice singing heartfelt songs. C'est tres bien.
B00005JMX4|5.0|this movie is really funny..and after seeing it it kinda makes you in a better mood cause you know even the biggest losers can get some girls..even though the main guy in that was  HOT..its hillarious too, and not much movies have a plot about how hard a porn stars life could be, so its kinda the first of its kind. and the girl in this is GORGEOUS..guyyss if you wanna see a REALLY hott girl..see this movie. so i most definitely suggest this movie. hope this helped.
B00018D44U|1.0|Same rubbish as the one before. Still unbeliveble how people all over the world can buy it.<BR>   If Norah Jones was a singer just known in a town somewhere, released those two albums and sold about 10 000 albums, I wouldn't say a word about it because then it had been shown that just a few like this kind of music. Now it's different; her albums sell in millions all over the world and I am totally dumbfounded.<BR>I can't really understand what's so unique about her music. It's even not good. Her music is just irritating and boring. Among the best reviewers on her albums are those who liked her music at first but then realized that it IS meaningless and boring. That's strong!
0440237688|4.0|Jonas lives in a world without choice.  Everything is cared for.  No one goes hungry.  No one feels pain.  To live in this world, the people have given up all their choices and emotions.  The Giver details how Jonas becomes the reciever of memory for his community.  He learns about the pain and the emotions of their past, and he and the giver take action.  <BR> I found that the book was well written, and rich with symbolics. If you were to look into it deeply you could see what it was telling you.  I did not like however, that the actual story did not seem to have a real solid plotline.  There was no real cause and effect.  There was no reasoning.  It seemed like a bunch of random incidents tacked togeather to create a meaning.  <BR>     Overall though, it is a good book that will wrap you around it's finger for a few hours and leave you wanting more.  Just wanting a bit too much more for my liking.
4789009637|5.0|My first-year Japanese college course uses Genki as its textbook, and it has proven to be a very helpful guide. I've had experience with Nakama, which was decent but a bit too disorganized with too much thrown around at once. The Jorden book, simply titled Japanese, is so dated that it is painful and contains no kana in the normal text of the book.<br />Genki gives the user the vocab they are likely to need, along with just enough kanji (which are tied to the vocab in the lesson). Everything is laid out simply yet concisely, and genki is by far the best book I've ever used. It is currently being used by the first year students at Indiana University.<br />What I love the most, other than its organization, is its use of kanji and kana. Virtually every word in Japanese in the book is in kana, with no romaji. Kanji (along with kana subscript) are used frequently. This has helped boost my reading speed greatly.
B00018D44U|4.0|I actually think many of the songs are better than the first CD.  Those who truly don't like the style...never will.  Those who love the style...her style...will continue to buy.  Guess music does that to folks &amp; always will.  <br />But...the reviews I find most interesting include the notes about Bandlink.  I for one do make my own compilations, not to give away, but to listen to with other songs I prefer to listen to.  Using software to mess up PCs will destroy the sales market, not enhance it.  Perhaps the fools who think this will create sales know something the people who buy music do not know.  If I had access to a list with CDs containing Bandlink...and I'm sure there is...I would not buy them.
B000002MP2|5.0|In my opinion, this is one of the greatest cds of all time.  Every song on this cd is a great one that i do not skip over when listening.  On most cds, there are songs from the start that you dont like becasue they are crap. This cd has no filler.  It is all great green day punk.
B00005Q4CS|5.0|The reasons this movie is brilliant are -in my opinion- not easily graspable for most people. This becomes more obvious if one reads some of the negative reviews here at Amazon.<BR>    I read here in some reviews that this movie is poor because...it's depressive! Since when do films need to be cheery to be good? Is life that way? Is reality, anybody's reality that way? I read in other reviews that this film is not good because &quot;there's no message involved&quot; or because &quot;there's no ethics defended&quot;. I really fail to understand such mindsets. This film is a depiction of reality, a very particular reality, that of people being addicted to heavy drugs and the lives they lead. THAT is the message. It's simply a raw depiction of a specific reality that millions of people (esp. in the west) are experiencing daily. Now, as far as &quot;ethics&quot; are concerned, i'll say this: if the director endulged in some heavy pedagogic diatribe via this film to tell us that &quot;drugs can be dangerous for you&quot; i'd simply say &quot;duh&quot; and watch something else. Besides, he does show that in a more than obvious way. But thankfully, he doesnt attempt to shove an agenda down our throats.<br />     Now to the film itself: I'd already been super-impressed with the director's previous film (the equally brilliant &quot;Pi&quot;) so i was more than intrigued about this one.<BR>     I was rewarded again by Aronofsky as a viewer. This film has great camera work (it's through and through cutting edge stuff visually) , great acting, minimal but efficient dialogue, <BR>and an absolutely superb conceptual soundtrack (most of it is based on one theme).<br />     It surely is hardcore in its visuals but there's more quality here to be discovered as the director doesnt try to impress with cheap and unrealistic scenes. There's nothing in the film that's over the top or exaggerated and that might sound as self-understood but there are more than enough films with a drug theme that stretch things to extremes visually as if depicting things realistically isn't overwhelming enough.<br />      No need to describe the plot as 10s of other reviews have already done so, so I'll simply reccommend this film (as many others did too) to anybody with a passion for groundbreaking cinema. Extra kudos for Burstyn's performance which is definately show-stealing but even more credits for the fact that &quot;Requiem for a dream&quot; doesn't merely stay on the illegal drug scene but takes a hard stab at the legal drugs. Legal they may be, but there's literally millions of people battling serious addictions from them and they continue to be prescribed massively nevertheless.<br />     An ode to antihypocrisy as well as great filmwork.
B00005JMJ4|1.0|I CONFESS: I didn't make it through this film, I fell asleep halfway through it. Plus, it bugs me that I used a free rental to watch this ode to paint drying on film.<br />I just wish the critics and the Oscar judges would be as honest as I am about this film. All the snappy dialog in the world can't hide the fact that this film GOES ABSOLUTELY NOWHERE. Why don't they just create a &quot;let's give Bill Murray an Oscar award for being such a swell guy&quot; Oscar category and be done with it.
0385504209|3.0|Ok, I'll admit it, I couldn't put it down! Honestly, from page one you're there - following Langdon everywhere. There's no way that you'll stop until it's all over and then you'll wish it wasn't! That's that kind of book. Aside from this,however, this book has no artistic value at all. Brown is a new Sidney Sheldon, that's all. Well... the new Sidney Sheldon who wans to be Umberto Eco but he can't.<br />Recommended for a light, afternoon read.
B000002G6J|5.0|This CD is a classic, no doubt about it.  It's a release that I would have to recommend to anyone that's a fan of Bossa Nova and Antonio Carlos Jobim's music.  To many, Wave is like the essence of Bossa Nova and a cornerstone in the genre.  Simply put, you haven't heard all there is to hear of Bossa Nova if you haven't heard this.<br />I love this CD - I can put it in no matter the time of day and unwind and relax.  It has soothing orchestration, gentle touches of life and the musicianship is stellar, of course, and it's very romantic.  It's almost like there's a song for each season of the year and once the music plays, you're taken to another place.  Of all the Antonio Carlos Jobim releases, this is certainly an essential - along with Elis and Tom.  So many artists have redone works here and it's safe to say that very very few of them capture the magic that the versions here do - with the notable exception of Elis Regina's &quot;Triste&quot; IMO.<br />Definitely PICK THIS UP!  It's worth every penny.  But be warned if you're a bit new to Bossa Nova, this isn't so much about Astrud Gilberto, Stan Getz or Joao Gilberto so the versions here are very different from theirs.  And if you do pick this up and like it, certainly check out Getz/Gilberto, Elis &amp; Tom, Astrud Gilberto and of course Joao Gilberto and work by Joyce.  Oh yeah, and check out &quot;Tide&quot;, by Antonio Carlos Jobim too.  Enjoy!
B00008J4P5|4.0|ok so they reach there peak with white blood cells ,then they come out with Elephant. Sure seven nation armys a good song but they beat it over the head on the radio ,now im sick of it. Their previous attempts are better beacuse they had better lyrics ,better music and better songs. They overproduced this album way to much i really hope they pull  themslef's around into what they had. I will recommend this album but listen to white blood cells first.
B00008CQS0|5.0|Yann Tiersen's soundtrack for 'Goodbye Lenin' really fits the film. That's everything I can say: It's the perfect soundtrack for a perfect movie.
B00006IU73|5.0|Complex, edgy, and beautiful.  A hard rocking yet somberly melodic prog album that features real musicianship.  I was drawn to this release after checking out the excellent band O.S.I.  One of the songs on that CD features lyrics by STEVEN WILSON (SHUTDOWN- great song) who I tracked to PORCUPINE TREE.  The great thing about this band is that they can be heavy but WILSON's voice is melodic and sweeping, never veering into the typical growling noise some vocalists rely on in heavy metal.  The result is a rich harmonic battery of tracks that sway from crunching guitar and complex traps to quiet moments of acoustic strum and hook.  If you love heavy rock n' roll with melodious, inventive vox along the same lines as (but decidedly  different from) TOOL, then IN ABSENTIA is right up your alley.  Cool CD.
B0001AP12G|5.0|By now we've all heard of the excellent production skills of Kanye West. He's produced for some of hip-hop's finest MC's including Jay-Z (&quot;Heart Of The City&quot;, &quot;Izzo&quot;, etc.), Talib Kweli (&quot;Get By&quot;), Ludacris (&quot;Stand Up&quot;) &amp; many many more including such R&amp;B acts as Alicia Keys (&quot;You Don't Know My Name&quot;). After hearing such great production everyone was already assured that Kanye would have a future in hip-hop, but now i know that Kanye doesn't need just his beats to get by. His debut album, College Dropout, blends incredible beats with intelligent, truthful, and sometimes funny lyrics. <br />Kanye West needs no help speaking out on important issues such as racism, terrorism &amp; cancer, he shows his skills in full effect on this amazing LP. The most brilliant aspect of Kanye's album is how he blends skill with the beats &amp; masters his lyrics. He displays tongue-in-cheek humor on such tracks as &quot;The New Workout Plan&quot; &amp; &quot;Spaceship&quot; but still keeps it serious when he needs to on &quot;Jesus Walks&quot;. The album really has no flaws songwise, the total of tracks have absolutely nothing negative to say about them. The singles &quot;Slow Jamz&quot; (also available on Twista's Kamikaze) &amp; &quot;Through The Wire&quot; assure the albums commerical success while &quot;Get 'Em High&quot;, &quot;Breathe In Breathe Out&quot;, &quot;Never Let Me Down&quot; &amp; &quot;Two Words&quot; assure its straight hip-hop success. The highlights of the album (even though the CD is flawless) include &quot;All Falls Down&quot;, the personal &quot;Family Business&quot;, street favorite &quot;Two Words&quot;, and the previously mentioned single &quot;Through The Wire&quot; were Kanye tells the story of the near-fatal car accident that almost took his life. To end off a perfect effort is &quot;Last Call&quot;, a track over 12 mins. long which not only features hard hitting lyrics (&quot;Mayonnaise colored Benz i push Miracle whips&quot;) but tells the full story of how Kanye got his record deal word-for-word. <br />The only negative part of College Dropout comes in the many skits. The album features 7 total and they seem to get in the way of things, some of them, however, do fit in with the songs (&quot;Workout Plan&quot;) but others just don't. Besides that, CD is the highlight of hip-hop in 2004 and shows just how far an artist can push theirselves to make a great album. <br />Top 5 Fav Tracks<br />1.) Two Words (featuring Mos Def, Freeway &amp; Harlem Boys Choir)<BR>2.) The New Workout Plan<BR>3.) All Falls Down (featuring Syleena Johnson)<BR>4.) Jesus Walks<BR>5.) Through The Wire
B000003TA4|1.0|Despite the overview, there's nothing shocking about Nirvana or Kurt Cobain, especially Kurt's &quot;pained&quot; screams and &quot;controversial&quot; lyrics. Nirvana was utterly harmless (they actually started devolution to what we now have today that is considered rock), and yet Kurt Cobain was so self-destructive towards himself. Kurt Cobain just screamed and shouted because he couldn't get anyone's attention any other way. He was like a two-year old who had to have a temper tantrum in orer to get his message across. Other times he just half-arsed mumbled the rest of what he said. Nevermind is so overrated it's nearly criminal. There's such better music than Nirvana out there, and it's a cryin' shame they've overshadowed all the great music of the 90's. Yes, they had two memorable songs (SLTS and HSB), but those two do not constitute all the praise they've gotten. Quite frankly, the only reason Nirvana's still so popular is because Kurt shot himself and that catipulated him to status of &quot;legend&quot;. But becaue of that, now you've got young kids and teens carving &quot;Kurdt&quot; in their wrists and them shooting themselves to prove their &quot;love&quot; for him. Wow, what a freakin' impact. Both Nirvana and Pearl Jam really blew. This so-called &quot;Alt-Rock&quot; has given way to schitt like Smile Empty Soul, Limp Bizkit, and Good Charolotte, all of who claim Kurt as their inspiration. Kurt spawned all of today's hate-rock whether he realizes it or not, and then left us to deal the mess he created after he did himself in. As long as people hold onto past music like Nirvana, we'll never move forward. Thanks for stagnating rock, Kurdt. Smashing Pumpkins are the rock gods Nirvana are wrongfully hailed as. Coincidentally, Kurt's Rome incident was caused by his thinking that Courtney was cheating on him with her previous love Billy Corgan. <br />1.5 out of 5
0156027321|5.0|its like old man and sea if it would be written by rushdie .. simply mindblowing.
B000001EC1|5.0|Just a note to the person who wrote a review on Feb 4, 2004.  What planet r u from if u think this is an accoustic album?!?!  This Left Feels Right is an accoustic album, CROSSROADS is NOT!!
B00012FXB8|5.0|This is a rarity.  Alien 3 is one of those flicks that gets more flack than it deserves.  The only real problem I had with the film when it was released was the fact that 20TH CENTURY FOX duped everyone into thinking that the third ALIEN movie was to take place on earth (due to the misleading teaser trailer).  I kind of liked the different style of the film and director FINCHER's bleak vision.  Upon hearing of the restored footage I ran out for my copy, and was not dissapointed.  The restored version adds some dimention to the characters and some more interesting plot arcs that make the film seem more complete.  The DVD also contains the original theatrical version and a plethora of extras that make this a must have for any fan of behind the scenes film making drama.  I'm usually interested in deleted scenes and not so much in making of documentaries.  All of the featurettes on this disc are really interesting.  It's pretty cool to see all of the turmoil surrounding the making of ALIEN 3, and the painstaking work that went into trying to mold a movie without a solid script or a sympathetic studio.  So watch it again, I enjoyed this more knowing that FINCHER crafted ALIEN 3 without a working draft and he was a first time director.  I found this to be any excellent viewing experience and the sound and picture quality are superb as well.  Great addition to any serious DVD collection.
B00018D44U|4.0|This cd took more than a few listens to grow on me. Now I think it's a very good cd. Songs like &quot;sunrise or Humble me&quot; are perfect night time songs. Feels like home has more of a country feel to it and is very consistent in quality. It's cool to finally have a young muscian who has talent. It's very rare these days.
B000006TRV|5.0|This album is by far one of the most ambitious and most accomplished albums of all time.  Perfect listening when in an altered state of mind.  The movie, with its intense visuals, only adds to the mystique of the album and helps the story along.
B00004UEIF|5.0|This album might not blow you away the first time you hear it, but man is it powerful. I honestly think that the synergy between Motian, LaFaro and Evans is comporable to that of the players in Davis's kind of blue. Chances are, if you're a jazz fan you've heard Kind of Blue. Evans was in it, and was absolutely amazing. Here, a few years later, he's at it again with a thoughtfulness, sensitivity and passion that might take a while to sink in, but it gets better each time you listen to it and if you're like me, you'll listen to this album hundreds of times. I haven't heard all of Evan's albums but a lot of people say that Live at the Village Vangaurd is the best. I think this album is so great that it tops even that album. I believe Evan's piano will be played as long as the piano of Bethoven . . . seriously! As if the previous reasons weren't enough to justify buying it, you'll hear one of the best bassists of all time. Buy it. The sooner the better.
B000066F6H|1.0|I'll tell you what sh@t for brains giving ***** to this horsecrap of a band called the hives - take your dog sh*t band back to whatever country you came from and shove Veni Vidi Vicious right up your wazoo you coward that cant make decisions for yourself.  Horrible, mainstream, designed by marketing guy, developed by Fox Networks, total a**hole of a sellout society, thats all I have to say, other than learn to swim.
B0001906O0|4.0|First off, has anyone else noticed that many of these recordings differ from the originals?? I've had most of these B-sides for years, and as far as I can tell, the earlier ones (i.e., songs from disc two and much of three, since I didn't have anything prior to that) sound like newly recorded versions - not just remastered or remixed, but re-done! I guess that could be an unexpected pleasure for most hard-core fans, as they are the ones who most likely spent their hard-earned cash on these songs already. Secondly, some of these songs are easily on a par with their best studio albums - in fact, I would have to say that &quot;This Twilight Garden&quot; may be my favorite Cure song ever! Sure, this could have been a 3-disc set, but stretching out boxsets with padding like unnecessary remixes, is pretty standard now. And it looks the rest of their B-library will be included on the remastered studio discs.
B000000OAC|5.0|Justin and duran duran?  you must be kiddin, Queen was and always will be possibly the greatest rocks bands in history, but you must have mature ears to hear it. justin? Freddy mercury had more talent in his pinky than justin has in his whole body. this album is my proof.
B000089RVX|5.0|Just listen to the words.<BR>It is not a cd for everyone but actually it is...<BR>The mix of instruments is absolutely fabulous <BR>And the lungs of the singer oh well she has a remarkable voice!<BR> E X C E L L E N T .
B00005AQE8|5.0|2Pac had all eyez on him them and even though he is no longer here, his inspiration and style is still well known. This 1996 album mixes a lot of emotions and beats and puts it all on two very well made CDs. The 1st CD of the set features songs such as &quot;How Do You Want It&quot;, which features the R&amp;B group, Jodeci. &quot;How Do You Want It&quot; has the coolness of Tupac along with the smoothness of Jodeci. &quot;2 of Amerikaz Most Wanted&quot; also features the well-known artist, Snoop Doggy Dogg. <br />The &quot;doggy style&quot; of Snoop combines with Tupac's style to give you &quot;2 Of Amerikaz Most Wanted&quot;. &quot;Only God Can Judge Me&quot; and &quot;I Ain't Mad at Cha&quot; are two of Tupac's more emotional songs on the album. Songs like this are one of the reasons that 2Pac is one of my favorite rappers. He not only gives you beats to dance to, but also songs that make you think. These songs make you look inside yourself as well as him and get to know who 2Pac is a lot better then you ever thought you did. <br />&quot;I Ain't Mad at Cha&quot; is one of my favorites, which illustrates his own personal feelings and experiences. In the video, it is actually illustrated to be predicting his own death and looking down on his loved ones and the experiences he's had and just saying &quot;i ain't mad at cha&quot; for the decisions you made, etc. The next song, &quot;Whatz Ya Phone #&quot; is also one of my favorites. This is one of the funniest songs I know. In the song, he is having a conversation with a female that gets a little nasty...and his reactions and responses are the funniest thing. <br />I highly recommend listening to this song!! The second CD in the set is not my favorite, but I do like the songs &quot;Shorty Wanna Be A Thug,&quot; &quot;Holla At Me,&quot; which is a very meaningful song with more personal feelings of 2Pac but it also has a good, semi-fast beat. &quot;Wonda Why They Call You B****&quot; is also one of my favorites because I can very much relate to these feelings about gold-digging women. I also recommend the songs &quot;When We Ride,&quot; and the title song &quot;All Eyez On Me&quot; which is the best song on this CD. <br />It has a fresh beat and it is also a song that allows you to look within 2Pac and understand the person he was. I think he made this the title song because it illustrates feelings that he strongly felt. I highly recommend this CD set! Be prepared for plenty of cursing, which is characteristic of 2Pac, but also plenty of good beats.
0789723107|5.0|Where to begin?    Mr. Krug has a writing style that matches my own: logical, easy to follow, and full of humor. Once I started reading, I simply couldn't put the book down.    This book gives a copious amount of information about the right ways and wrong ways to design a web site. Mr. Krug easily pairs this information with live examples of sites that are online, or intranet sites in which he played a part. Interjected in this valuable information are some of the funniest barbs, observations, and comments I've heard in quite some time.    Most of the concepts in this book are straight common sense. So common, in fact, that we tend to overlook them, and consequently violate the rules. Don't worry, Mr. Krug gently points them out to you with vivid pictures and diagrams, and has you laughing while he does it. He even has a name for his business that ties in to this common sense mentality. Read the book - you'll understand...and smile.    Want to know what billboards and roadsigns in Los Angeles and Boston have to do with web design? Read the book. You'll soon discover yourself critiqing road signs and such in the area of town you live. Department stores will become a library of examples on how to organize and display information. And you'll always, ALWAYS find yourself analyzing web sites that you already frequent, and pointing out what works and what could be improved upon.    One question: are you a scanner or reader? You'll find out once you read this book. And then you'll be amazed at the accuracy of what Mr. Krug has said and what you actually do when you're on the web.
6305897786|2.0|I loved the book and I was really looking for ward to the movie adaptation.  I was prepared for all the normal compromises you must expect.  However this movie fails on most levels despite the best efforts of Johnny Depp.  The script is just terrible, and nothing anyone can do can get past that.<br />I can see why the movie bombed, there is just isn't much to recommend.  The cinematography is good, even great in parts.  So perhaps that might appeal to a film student.  Otherwise the movie is without real merit.
B00005JMJ4|1.0|This movie has one scene that is worth a look (and it lasts about 2 minutes), but the rest is trash.  It is one of the most boring movies I have ever suffered through.  In the beginning, you are not sure what's happening, but you're sure that it's slow and dull.  About half way through, you finally understand what the movie is about and where it's going and you are extremely disappointed.  Finally, you reach the end and if you are still awake, you are feeling extremely unfulfilled and robbed.  I don't understand where all the hype comes from.  It must be one of those movies that people don't dare to hate because somewhere along the line it became &quot;cool&quot; to like it.  You will feel robbed even if you don't pay money to see it.  I want my hour and a half back!
B0000AXE8I|5.0|I'm going to open by saying i really enjoyed this movie.  I have heard other people say it wasn't good, it sucked, whatever.  i don't feel that way.  If we go back in time to 1980, people said the same things about The Empire Strikes Back.  This is because both films ask more questions than they answer.  The effects in Reloaded were better than the first most times, although a few scenes i found to be lacking after a second or third viewing.  Without giving away any of the film, I'll just say pay attention to the dialog.  There are some really interesting twists and explanations.  This is one of those rare films, like the first one, that bears repeat viewing.  I totally recommend this movie.
B00003CXIY|2.0|Going into this, I thought I would like this movie.  I figured it would tread the same line as the American Pie movies.  I found it, however, very disappointing.  I've never been a fan of Tom Green.  His patent &quot;Confused stare&quot; is stomach churning.  An accidental genious, if you will, and I am glad America has woken up from their hypnotized state that he had over them.  All the other characters are unlikeable.  The pot head kid is an arrogant, self-serving, character that is too smart for his own good.  DJ Qualls is too whiny in the beginning and then is too full of himself at the end.  Sean William Scott tries but fails to save this movie by delivering a second-rate Stifler.  The ending feels too much like a cop out.  Breckin Meyer gets saved because of Tom Green's stupidity.  If only Tom Green would have taped over Paris Hilton's tape.  A better ending would have been if his girlfriend beat him to a bloody mess.
B000022TSH|3.0|I am a film noir but I haven't watched it in years because of Polanski's conviction and subsequent flight to avoid imprisoment for molesting that little girl.  For that reason I am boycotting all of his movies.<br />The tough part is, this is a good movie.  Not the greatest of it's genre, but still worth seeing.  So it's for each person to decide.  Does the quality of the art out weigh the crimes of the artist?  For me the answer was no.
B000002G87|5.0|Occasionally, something will enter your life and, from the very first moment, grab you and never let you go.  Once (or twice) in a lifetime, a person can do this to us. In this case, it was the essential music on \\"Layla and Other Assorted Love Songs\\".  When I bought this record 7 years ago, the moment I heard the modestly pointed opening chords of \\"I Looked Away\\", I was locked in.  But that was just the beginning.  This is one of those rare records which improves and reveals more details with each listen, growing on you song by song.  It clearly ranks with the 4 or 5 greatest albums of all time.  \\"Layla\\" teems with passion and few other records inspire such emotion.    There's hardly time or space to cover even a fraction of \\"Layla's\\" brilliant moments. The soaring, shimmering solos on \\"I Looked Away\\", the gutbucket chorus on \\"Bell Bottom Blues\\", the emotive coda on \\"Why Does Love Got to Be So Sad?\\" and, of course, the magnum opus title track move you with their soulfulness and passion.  The thematic consistency is also brilliant.  Nothing immerses us more than unrequited love, and in every song, Clapton grapples with his from a myriad of angles.  Duane Allman proves his greatness throughout and pushes Clapton to heights unseen before or since.  The real surprise is how Bobby Whitlock (what happended to him??!) is equally inspirational. You can even hear him practically kick Clapton to the next level near the end of \\"Anyday\\" where he interrupts him, bellowing, \\"You Gotta Be a Man!!!\\", as if to say, get to the real point of this record, E.C.  As for \\"Why Does Love..?\\"..  whew.  That song is even more tumultuous than the famed title track and is nearly as cathartic.  During this fierce ninth track, Clapton and Allman solo constantly and the band sounds liable to fall apart before the boil gently cools to that adorable coda.  The solo during the bridge of \\"Anyday\\" is one of the best and most expressive ever in rock.    One could write endlessly about the gifts this record offers.  To sum it up in a word: powerful.  Whether you are embroiled in passion for someone or are contently driving alone along a stretch of highway, this song cycle of spectacular music will move you--right up until the final chords on \\"Thorn Tree in the Garden\\" gently melt away.  One for the ages.
B00005JLT5|5.0|\\"The Pianist\\" is one of the top 10 best films of 2002.  It was rightfully nominated for seven Oscars, including Best Picture, going on to win three: Best Director, Best Actor, and Best Adapted Screenplay.  Its true story of world-famous pianist, Wladyslaw Szpilman, who struggles for his life during the Holocaust is very powerful, yet brilliant.  The hardcore drama begins the moment his passionate music career becomes threatened by Hitler.  Its material is close to as graphic as the actual conditions, which is how it should be displayed.  Such intensity, which is never lost for a second, guarantees an emotional reaction.  All the emotions in the scenery and through the characters are heartpounding through Szpilman's entire unfortunate journey.  The immense research of these events is present.  The writer's own heart and soul was written in every word.  This project was wonderfully led by Roman Polanski's brilliant vision.  His directing talents answer why he deserves his legendary status.<br />The set scenery is as accurate to the actual buildings and living conditions of Europe in 1939-1945.  The hard work through the construction paid off, adding extra living intensity.  The clothing worn in the movie adds the necessary emotional value that keeps audiences watching.  All other physical details in this film are also flawless, namely the make-up and the dirty scenery (dirt, burns, blood, etc.).  The musical score was composed beautifully, blending perfectly with every scenes' particular mood.<br />The performances from all the actors are beyond words.  Adrien Brody beautifully portrays Szpilman in his career-launching role.  His every drop of heart and soul are obviously presented through his character.  This is one of the best Holocaust movie roles in cinema history.  His talents prove that he'll be around for many more years.  A few other actors could have received Oscar nominations for their supporting roles without critic complaints.<br />\\"The Pianist\\" is a greatmovie for entertainment and education.  This future classic is sure to please many audiences.  Those looking for more perspectives on the Holocaust should also watch \\"Schindler's List\\", which offers a more graphic look.
B00003CXXP|2.0|The premise of the movie was good but after the first half it dissolved into unitelligible nonsense.  Looks like the writer ran out of any ideas as to what to do with it at the end and dreamed his way into nothingness.  Pinocchio is a much better story, has much more meaning (actually that isn't hardto do because this was very little meaning in AI) and is much more satisfying to watch.  AI tried to be a modern-day (future-day) Pinocchio but fell flat.
0440237688|5.0|What would it be like to live in a world where everything is exactly the same for everyone? \\"The Giver\\" by Lois Lowery is a truly extraordinary book that ponders this very question. Jonas, a young boy, never gave much thought to the way things were until the day he was chosen to be the next Receiver. The Receiver is the one person who holds all the memories of the way things were, \\"Before\\" A decision has to be made. Should he allow things to remain as they are, or should he attempt, against impossible odds, to change them. <BR> I greatly enjoyed the book. It made me realize how great it is to have a world of diversity. Pain is not always bad, it is what makes us stronger. Lowry thoroughly explored the concept of good vs. evil, and pleasure vs. pain. I recommend this book to anyone who wonders what it truly means to be your self in a \\"follow the leader\\" kind of world.
B00005B5L4|5.0|After reading many of the reviews, I decided to buy the DVD-A version of Rumours and listen for myself.<br />I think the mix and overall sound quality is excellent.  I do not hear the so-called variance in mix quality as the disc progresses.  <br />That said, I am not sure why they decided to change the song orders...it doesn't make sense.<br />Overall, an excellent choice for DVD-A.
B000059Z8J|4.0|Now that comic book films are part of Hollywood, it is helpful to re-examine one of the first and the best.  Richard Donner's direction of this film is excellent, as is the acting by the cast.  The wonderful midwestern landscapes of this film are still as beautiful now as they were then (I think they were shot in Canada, if memory serves correctly), and are in my view WAY underrated.  It took twelve years (Dances With Wolves) before the plains were shot this way again.<br />I also remember the big hub-bub about Marlon Brando's salary for this film...Brando's performance is very good and just reinforces why he is one of the all time greats. <br />Many people remember Star Wars.  This is the film that I remember from that time.  Truly a classic.
B00000CQJZ|4.0|I like this movie, the characters are believable and sympathetic, the action is riveting, and there is enough suspense . . . but . . . why is the plot so convoluted.  Why involve Big Ben and why don't the bad guys just take out the good guys in a more conventional manner.  But it is a good movie anyway, even if the basic premise doesn't make sense to me, and I would recommend it.
B000003B6J|5.0|okay so i know BDP was ground breaking i grew up on BDP too but any true hip hop follower..especially old school hip hop would tell you that Str8 outta compton is classic dont be fooled by the profane raps ...these dudes had somthin to say...NWA the greatest rap group there was...Beatles of Hip hop if i must say
B00008S2VH|5.0|Madonna is much more interesting, deep and sensitive. Her lastest album \\"American Life\\" is a declaration of freedom and love, an attempt to go against the mainstream beliefs, she even declares \\"nobody knows me \\" in one of her songs, why? Maybe she has always been misunderstood, when the \\"material girl\\" video was released many people started callig her \\"the material girl\\", which she hated , of course, in her words \\"I made that video to show that love is more important than money\\", which was clear for intelligent people that understood her irony to the mainstream machismo. In \\"american life\\", she made sure it was clear enough what she meant, maybe that is why many people feel disturbed by that, a queen of pop speaking against the us republican government in times of war instead of saying \\"lets give charity for the poor people and praise president bush\\": It is clear, Madonna is not anti-american(she vaunted some not- mainstream-american lifestyles- as the black gay culture), rather, she is anti some republican americans that have done so much damage to the world. The \\"Hollywood\\" track and video corrobores that idea, a crytics to some superfitial and nonsense lifestyles of california, there is a huge similarity to the artist Cindy Sherman, an intellectual and well known photographer in the artworld. \\"American Life\\" cd has so much to say to the world.
B00005JM0B|1.0|I hate this movie so much it doesnt deserve one star. I loved the first and second film but this is just pure garbage. I hate this film but then again it has the governator. Garbage garbage garbage, dont even see it. worst film ever
B000001FHV|5.0|Definitely one of the great albums from 1994 or even the mid-90s.  The Meat Puppets have a country twang mixed with metal power chords that makes this a great album to listen to. For the more country mix I love &quot;A Hole in the Wall&quot; and &quot;Comin Down&quot;.  More metal induced riffs are some of the first tracks on the album like &quot;Violet Eyes&quot;. My personal tastes run from Grateful Dead to Frank Black to Norah Jones to acid jazz, etc... so if you have a wide range of tastes - like good guitar and bass work - with lyrics that are more thought provoking/interesting than pick the album up.
B00006LLNV|3.0|Of course Goldenthal would win accolades for a film score which is pretty atypical for his body of work.  Gone are the driving basses, the thunderous percusions, the Strussian strings.  They're replaced with latin flavors and some great songs which, while wonderful, are not what a true fan of Goldenthal's work would expect.  Perhaps he got the Oscar for his work the previous year for FINAL FANTASY, a much better work and vastly more representative of Goldenthal's style.
B00005JLXE|4.0|Daredevil is a fun DVD. Not realistic, but fun. Radioactivity heightens Matt Murdock's senses and reflexes so he can do all kinds of amazing things. Silly, but entertaining. Some like to believe that Spiderman's powers are more real, and maybe they are a bit more &quot;believable&quot; sort of, but would a human really be able to leap several feet leap up in the air and do amazing flips and things just because he got bit by a spider? Hell no. Is it remotely credible? No way. Sure it's a radioactive spider, but it's still impossible folks. Don't forget the impossible wall climbing because of little spider hairs on his fingers too, AND the giant spider webs that shoot out of his wrists, AND the idea that the the spider bite gave him super-human strength too, AND that time slows down around him, AND he can see things before they happen.... All of this stuff is impossible and even dumb, but fun. The X-men don't really make any sense either although the whole &quot;they were just born that way&quot; excuse for all kinds of impossible powers always makes me smile. Daredevil is an entertaining DVD which will require a flight of fancy and a sense of humor. This isn't Remains Of The Day, or The Hours and non-&quot;Tekkies&quot; who can lighten up will probably like Daredevil more than those who pick apart comic book movies for being incredible. Most of it is impossible and absurd, but comic's are impossible and absurd. Lighten up, settle in, and have fun.
B000003TA4|5.0|This is a great album. It sucks that theres no more nirvana. Kurt Cobain is an icon who will never be forgotten. How dont know how people could not like this band. This is the greatest band of all time. Kurt Cobain was murdered which sucks because he was great. Dave Grohl said nirvana was breaking up but anyways kurt cobain should have been with another band. This is the best band of all time
B0001GOH6Q|5.0|Do you like magic?  (The kind that can actually happen?)  If so you'll like this movie.  If Hollywood made more movies like this, the world would be a better place.  This will be one I buy . . .
B000001GQY|5.0|Hearing Piano Concertos 1 and 2 from this cd was love at first listen. What I love most about Brahms' piano concertos, aside from their combination of deep passion and virtuosity, is how the piano organically blends in with the orchestra. And what better tandem to bring this out than the Berliner Philharmoniker and Emil Gilels? It truely doesn't get much better than this from a musical standpoint. Piano Concerto no. 2 is one of my all-time favorites. It has everything, including the beautiful 3rd movement in which piano and cello sound so graceful together; and a glimpse of Brahms' outstanding talent for composing for small ensembles and piano.
B00005JM02|5.0|It's outstanding, how the Pixar people have come to make such a realistic animated movie, so I'm not going to praise them more, because it's obvious this is a well done technical movie, instead I'm gonna tell you that the plot of this movie, is simply innovative, and creative, touches delicate topics, like the death of a parents, without getting to much into detail.  The story of an scared father searching for his son thru all the pacific, is simply delgihtful, and the heartouching ending is better, specially this movie teaches everyone, that friends like Doris, even if she is like out of place and without focus could give you a needed hand, so remember this is a great movie, well done, and with a great message.
B00005JMJ4|2.0|An okay movie but as most of the reviews state, very oversold. If it wasnt made by a Coppola it'd be just another film.
B000099T2L|3.0|Let me start off by saying that I am a Beyonce fan.  I think she is a wonderful artist with great showmanship...... BUT , I feel that this cd is HIGHLY overrated.  The first 4 songs are definitely nice.. but tracks 5 on down just continues this downward spiral that plagues this cd.  &quot;I'd Rather Be With You&quot; , &quot;Me, Myself, &amp; I&quot; and &quot;Yes&quot; are great songs..... however, the extended version (as I like to call it) of &quot;Dangerously in Love&quot; is just a bit too much... the song didn't need any rearranging... &quot;Signs&quot; should have been left out in the cold...overproduced...(sorry Missy).. and &quot;Speechless&quot;... just drags this cd down. &quot;That's How You Like&quot; shocked me... I didn't think she would do a song like that(and yes, her boyfriend/husband is featured on this also)  I've read the 5 star reviews and they are hilarous... as with anything, you have people who do not &quot;listen&quot; to the album and soo quick to label others as &quot;haters&quot; when that is not the case.
0780626494|5.0|Calvin Webber (Christopher Walken) is a slightly mad genius living in Los Angeles at the height of the Cold War. Paranoid about the communist threat, he has made a vast and elaborate nuclear bunker under his house. And, at the height of the Cuban Missile Crisis, he takes the precaution of going into it with his pregnant wife Helen (Sissy Spacek). By bizarre coincidence, just as they get down underground, a military aircraft crashes on their house. Convinced this is the dreaded nuke, he locks in and they prepare to stay there for 35 years until the radiation reaches safe levels. Finally come the 1990s and son Adam (Brendan Fraser) is sent out to reconnoitre and get look for fresh supplies in what they are convinced is a nightmarish and disintegrated post-apocalyptic world. (The neighbour has gone badly downhill in a way that makes this a more than understandable mistake.) Out he goes armed only with an indefatigable innocence and decency, an unshakable conviction that Perry Como is at the cutting edge of popular music and what he does not yet realize is a huge fortune in vintage baseball cards. After a few hours he is seriously at sea and hopelessly lost. Then he meets Alicia Silverstone's wordly and cynical Eve...<br />The central conceit of this film is the clash of what is basically a 1950s sensibility with the harsh and cynical realities of 1990s America. That way it strongly recalls `Pleasantville', made a year earlier. But this is a much better film. While `Pleasantville' rather condescended to the past, with its knowing modern kids teaching stuffy old 50s types how to be cool and have sex, this film is much more intelligently ambivalent about the blessings of modernity and has a very nice satirical edge. Not to mention much funnier. It is Eve who learns from Adam far more than the reverse. It's essentially an unusual romantic comedy with a bizarre fantasy premise. But it's an unusually sharp, witty and unintelligent romcom. A certain mismatch between British and American senses of humour may partly explain why I seldom laugh out loud at American movies. Several lines in this were notable exceptions. Its best moments recall, as very very few contemporary films manage to recall, the sharply observed intelligence of the great Hollywood romantic comedies of the 30s and 40s. Fresh, entertaining and extremely well-acted, it's well worth a look.
B00009V7T2|5.0|in short this is the best album i have heard in ages.  a quick side not about it:the entire album is about a tribute story the singer wrote about his friend who killed himself. he wrote a fictional account about his death, how he attempts suicide but doesnt die and falls into a coma for days, and when he wakes up still decides to kills himself. so the album is one big story. just thought the fans might want to know. the music is hardrock/spacey/experimental and the vocals from cedic are as usual...incredible. no offense to radiohead, but this is our generations pink floyd......in the end though, they will be remembered as the first mars volta.
0783223218|2.0|Not too good, not too bad, &quot;The Jackal&quot; is one of those average action movies that brings nothing new but it`s a competent and mildly pleasant product nonetheless. The plot is derivative and predictable, the characters are bland, yet director Michael Caton-Jones chooses some decent actors (Bruce Willis, Richard Gere), a neat soundtrack (Massive Attack, Primal Scream, Moby) and some decent action sequences that manage to deliver a minimum level of entertainment value. As far as popcorn movies go, there`s certainly worse, so this is a fair choice to spend a couple of mind-numbing hours. <BR>Watchable but forgettable.
B00011RPB0|1.0|I have to admit that I'm not a Bill Murray fan, but how this movie could get 5 stars frome anyone is a mystery.  It is plotless, houmorless, and an overall waste of time and money.  Can people &quot;pump&quot; a movie online just to get sales up?  Every movie I've seen Murray in was better than this one.
B000089RVX|5.0|This album has got everything a true rocker wants in an album.<BR>The songs are easy to understand and very easy to relate to. I give this CD *****.  ROCK ON!<BR>... cant wait to hear more from them in the futurel influences:  how else could I justify liking both Evanescence and Megadeth? :-)<br />Other female rock vocalists I like are Liesje Sadonius (Hooverphonic's first album), Mari Anne Braeden (Green Apple Quickstep) and Sara McLachlan.  In some ways Amy Lee's voice sounds similar: sweet, mellow and vulnerable.  <br />Hopefully Evanescence will be able to follow up with more great albums.  Other bands with sudden fame could never come close to their debuts like Dishwalla and 3 Doors Down.  Evanescance has a good range.  The music flows from dark, quiet piano and vocal pieces like Hello and My Immortal to the all-out rock of Going Under and Bring Me To Life, and everything in between like Taking Over Me and My Last Breath.  <br />If all goes well they will realize the advantage they have of exploring all of these styles and they won't fall into the trap of choosing to play only pop or only rock. gorgeous and should be the envy of all girls in america.  i think the greatest aspect of their show, however, was that people, who listened to music from different genres that attended that music festival, all knew the words to their songs.  it's not often you find a band that appeals to both goth kids and top 40 radio listeners.<br />needless to say, after that performance, i was captivated.  their sound is indescribable and amy's voice, uncomparable.  i seriously prefer staying at home singing along with her voice rather than going out.  okay, so that's really sad, but i think you get the idea.  anyway, if you don't already have &quot;fallen,&quot; shame on you.  if you're hesitant and not yet convinced, try downloading &quot;going under,&quot; &quot;my immortal,&quot; &quot;tourniquet,&quot; &quot;taking over me,&quot; and &quot;whisper&quot; to get an idea of evanescence's genius.  and if they ever stop in your city for a show, make sure you catch it, even if the ticket price is outrageously high.  you will definitely not be disappointed.
1582432678|4.0|The only reason I gave this book four stars is because I found it to be a bit of a slow starter, but perhaps that's only me.  Otherwise, its immensely difficult subject matter and excellent writing made it one of the best books I've read in the past several years.  I can't recommend this book highly enough.
B000002PB2|4.0|An excellent album, to be sure but the track list on this page doesn't apply to Dawn Patrol!
0316779237|5.0|World-famous erotic artists/literatti Je.X.x.X. Gordon and Sara de Holmes (a.k.a. \\"The Americans\\") recommended to me this wonderfully short little plopper of a writer, and I couldn't be happier to have taken the advice.  As Gordon pointed out in a recent SF Bay-Area appearance - after he and De Holmes re-enacted the final love scene from the Marquis De Sade's lost novel, The Merit of being Meretricious - the contemporary literary repertoire has taken a disturbing turn with its obstinate stance of high-falootin'ness.  I don't mean (nor did Je.X.x.X., to my knowledge) to bemoan high-falootin' literature *per se*, but the lit journal hegemony has seemingly chosen high-falootin' writers to the point of exclusion of all others....<br />Enter David Sedaris...<br />With Sedaris, we finally have an author who can satisfy both the high-falootin' crowd and those with at least a marginal sense of humor [litmus test : if you laughed out loud (LOL'ed to you interweb addicts) during the encore of Madonna's Oklahoma City concert during the Papa don't Preach tour, you most likely have at least a marginal sense of humor.].  Here he is, a U. of Iowa graduate (or so Gordon says - I haven't checked for myself..) with a knack for post-modernistically meaningless sentences such as \\"We turned instinctively to our mother\\" (page 88, Holidays on Ice), a cleverly unoriginal first name that brings up images of infuriatingly incoherent short story authors, and cool pictures of himself smoking cigarrettes (probably either hand-rolled or European.. no, wait, probably the cheap brand that your retarded uncle buys..).  Add to that formula a public-radio-worthy wittiness and a cute smile, and you've got yourself one of today's rising literary stars. <br />Sedaris owns! Bring it!
B000008M54|5.0|The Waterboys are best known for the song &quot;The Whole of the Moon,&quot; which although overplayed thanks to being released as a single both in 1985 and 1990, is still their best song. But Fisherman's Blues is their best album. It's one of the most cohesive albums I've ever listened to, integrating a range of musical influences: Irish folk, some rock and some soul. As well as a cover of Van Morrison's &quot;Sweet Thing,&quot; they use part of a Beatles song and close their album with Woody Guthrie's &quot;This Land is Your Land.&quot;<BR>The title track and &quot;A Bang on the Ear&quot; are my favorite songs on this album, also being the most radio-friendly. But I also enjoy the Irish instrumental, &quot;Jimmy Hickey's Waltz,&quot; the aforementioned &quot;Sweet Thing&quot; and &quot;When Will We Be Married.&quot; &quot;We Will Not Be Lovers&quot; and &quot;World Party&quot; are more reminiscent of their previous album, This is the Sea. While not my favorites, they display the uninhibited fiddle playing that became The Waterboys' signature alternative rock sound.
B00008HCCF|5.0|Definitely Norah Jones is a first class singer and a very good proof of her talent is this amazing DVD.<br />This show was captured in New Orleans few months before she won 8 Grammys with her debut album, the Multi-platinum, #1 &quot;Come away with me&quot;.<br />The show starts with &quot;Cold, cold heart&quot; and from there you go through a wonderful experience all the way to &quot;Don't know why&quot;, the song that closeses the show.<br />The atmosphiere in this show is very simple but intense, don't imagine a show like Cher's with lots of lights, change of custumes and all that. This was taken at the House of Blues in New Orleans but it's really amazing. Norah's music if you don't know it very well is soft but delightful, you can listen to her for hours, days, months...all your life and never get tired and if you know her music or have one or both of her cds, this is a must have.<br />You'll find here almost all her &quot;Come away with me&quot; repertory and some unknown songs. You'll also get the change to see her &quot;Come away with me&quot; video as a special feature and the encored &quot;Tennessee waltz&quot;.<br />I recommend the songs &quot;Cold, cold heart&quot;, &quot;Nightingale&quot;, &quot;Seven years&quot;, &quot;Feelin' the same way&quot;, &quot;Come away with me&quot;, &quot;Lonestar&quot; and &quot;Don't know why&quot;.<br />You won't be sorry with this DVD.
038572179X|5.0|This was one of the most beautiful books I've ever read.  McEwan shows astounding insight into the mind of the young girl at the center of the story and creates a wonderully woven tapestry of the people and the world around her. His ability to provide the reader with a sympathetic viewpoint as we see a tragedy unfolding is remarkable. Throughout the book are instances that showed a deep understanding of the strengths and weaknesses consistent with our human condition, and that there may be reasoning behind even the most profound mistakes that we make in life. I couldn't put it down.
076780421X|5.0|I love this movie.  It has become my all-time favorite love story.  Very well done!
0684800713|2.0|This book reminds me of a painting that has so much detail that you can't figure out what the artist is trying to say.
B0000C1733|5.0|Most of the songs on here are pretty good.  In my opinion, they shouldn't have put Universally Speaking and Road Trippin' on here, and put I Could Have Lied, or something else from Mother's Milk or One Hot Minute.  Nonetheless, I think it's worth a buy.  Buy BSSM if you don't already have it first though.
0440237688|4.0|When I was assigned to read \\"The Giver\\" by Louis Lowry, I was having to actually do it. I usually hate reading for school and tend to put it off until the last minute but I had a snow day and decided to start it. I read the entire book in one seating. I really enjoyed it! Some parts were kind of unnerving but I liked the concept of a \\"perfect\\" world. It's very interesting to think about. It makes you imagine how the future will be. I would definately read this book again. It's short but has a powerful message behind it.
B0000C8AQM|3.0|Where are &quot;Back In Black&quot; and &quot;Highway To Hell&quot;, by AC/DC?? &quot;Smoke On The Water&quot; by Deep Purple? &quot;Iron Man&quot; by Black Sabbath? Instead of that, the others are in the cd soundtrack, but for you, who are entering the magical world of rock music now, don't forget to get this soundtrack together with another amazing albums, like the ones Jack Black gave to the childrens, Jimi Hendrix &quot;AXIS BOLD AS LOVE&quot; that's wonderfull, Pink Floyd &quot;Dark Side Of The Moon&quot;, that's PERFECT, Yes &quot;Fragile&quot;, that's a real classic too, and other wonderfull rock albums of only the good old rock'n'roll music! KIDS WANNA ROCK!!!
B000002I53|5.0|This is a wonderful CD in so many ways.  If you are not a lover of jazz, this would be a great introduction to the genre.  Coltrane is one the greatest jazz musicians of all time and Elvin Jones is arguably in the top two or three greatest jazz drummers.  Really a perfect CD.
0962477060|5.0|Let me start off by saying that this book is unique, and because of that, it will probably always have detractors. I am writing to advise you not to pay any attention to them. There are thousands of books out there which teach guitar as if it is no different from a piano and I've bought an awful lot of them and wasted a lot of time. <br />The nay sayers seem to be attacking it in part because it gets rave reviews from readers. They seem to want to elevate themselves by putting down others, which is sad, but all too common. If I could, I'd ask them to produce credentials first, and then I'd ask how much effort they actually put into it. I'm pretty sure they are not household names in the field of guitar. A good example is the guy who felt slighted because Fretboard Logic didn't make him \\"master his guitar.\\" Heh. That's funny and sad at the same time. To me that sounds like some kind of cart and horse situation where the horse is sitting back on his haunches waiting for a ride from the cart. <br />Let ME be clear - Fretboard Logic is the first book I have read which treats this unique instrument with the respect and detailed analysis it deserves. I am eternally grateful to the guy for taking the time and effort to put it together for the people like me who always wondered if there wasn't something missing from what my own teachers were teaching. After reading the Special Edition, I bought the entire series including the videos, and I'm glad I did. I will admit to having had to reread certain things a few times before it sunk in, but I usually have to do that anyway with any new stuff I'm learning - like with my pilots license, for example. And a lot of those books weren't even as well-written as Fretboard Logic.<br />Some of these Amazon flamers apparently don't understand what they are reading very well. One guy asks \\"How long can you fake being a musician without reading music?\\" Disregarding the tortured grammar, the implication is that Fretboard Logic is \\"anti-reading\\" or something. I guess maybe his copy was missing the introductions in the back, including \\"Introduction to Music Theory\\" where the author introduces various notation formats including -you guessed it - standard music notation which is continued in the next book.<br />But aside from gross misrepresentation, there is an even more important issue at stake here, and that relates to personal choice. If I understand him correctly, Mr. Edwards is trying to let each player decide for themselves the direction in which to take their musical efforts after the basics are covered. Here is an example:  say you want to learn to improvise blues - just to jam away to your hearts content and make it up as you go along. What does that have to do with reading music? Answer:  NOTHING. Reading something previously written isn't relevant when you are improvising. Same goes for things like, say, using a pick. If you are studying classical music, it isn't likely that you will have much use for a flat pick - but you probably would if you chose to study bluegrass. Each player's choices create a range of relevant subject matter. To my knowledge Fretboard Logic is the only series to even attempt to give the student so much freedom of choice. Only when I got to the third book did I start to fully understand why he put things in the order he did. It's all about building on solid foundations and allowing us to make our own choices about what we want to play. In book III I found some of the material very useful, but frankly, some of it didn't pertain to me.  Since the chapters on notation - including tab - were so helpful to me personally, it is ironic that the guy is getting slammed for not having it in the first two sections. The people criticizing Logic apparently have a form of tunnel vision and can only see things in terms of their own narrow field of experience. <br />Bottom line - the author is trying to get us away from what he calls the \\"put this finger here, that finger there,\\" typeof thinking. Why? Because it creates a rote mindset that stifles creative thinking and keeps people stuck in the beginner stages of playing. (I'm just glad I don't have to have to carry around a giant chord book with me anymore.) To the guys who can only think in terms of one dot/note/finger at a time I would just remind them that when you arrange those dot/notes/fingers on the page into tonal groupings and meaningful wholes - what do you start to see on the fretboard? PATTERNS. It just takes a lot longer the old way. <br />The problem these people are having with Fretboard Logic is not because of the material or the organization - it is too clearly written and illustrated. Some people just don't engage in things that are not terribly easy, and playing guitar is not an easy endeavor. Also, I suspect it has to do with something the author mentions in the end of the first book:  resistance to learning. Bill says - I'm paraphrasing - that learning new things is somewhat akin to \\"breaking eggs to make an omelet\\" and that there will always be a natural resistance to changing the status quo in our brains. I guess the smart people out there who do learn new things easily get used to this, and those who don't, prefer not having new ideas disrupt their intellectual comfort zones. Since Fretboard Logic is so different, I guess it will always have its detractors. Not me. I  wish I'd ignored them in the first place. I'd have bought it sooner and saved a lot of time and money. THANK YOU BILL EDWARDS.
B00005JMJ4|1.0|I could not believe how much attention this film has garnered given its use of offensive Japanese stereotypes which inadvertently and ultimately detract from the artistic merits of the film. I found the protagonist played by Scarlett Johansson so unlikeable when she continued to say such dumb comments about why the Japanese mix up their r's and l's. She's supposed to be a Yale graduate but yet she doesn't know that there are more a few thousand languages in the world, which don't have a r's and l's in their compendium of sounds? There was a continual undercurrent theme of the Japanese being strange and incomprehensible, which definitely verged on racism, however, covert. They are mocked at because the characters in the film did not care to delve further into the culture of the country that they were visiting. The characters are portrayed as isolated and lonely because of their cultural ambiance (foreign and strange Tokyo) not by their choices to remain aloof and uncurious. These characters were not intelligent cultured people though I believe it was the artist's intention to depict them as such. The dialogue was grossly insipid. The only real parts of the film are when Bob, Bill Murray's character and Charlotte, Johansson's character share some beautifully orchestrated intimate, but platonic moments. It's packaged to be an artsy movie, but laden with cliches and cheap laughs at the expense of the Japanese. I understand that the isolationist element was the backdrop to the romance between the 2 leads. The creation of a milieu conducive to feelings of alienation experienced by the main characters did not need to use Japan-bashing. This storyline could have taken place anywhere, in New York City, Iraq, or a party in local neighborhood. But must Coppola resort to racism in order create to the effect that she did? A more skillful artist would NOT.
0385493622|5.0|Depicts Andrew Wiles quest to solve Fermat's Last Theorem (Last theorem in a sense that it was the last theorem of Fermat's devoid of a rigorous proof). Author takes the reader to the times of Archimedes, Euler, Fermat then to the modern day Andrew Wiles. <br />Singh makes an effort to make his prose understandable even to people with a high school mathematics background. Appendixes contains some simple proofs for those who want to know, less mathematically inclined readers can read on. There is no detailed explanation for Fermat's Last Theorem in the Appendixes though as I believe it is difficult to comprehend, nonetheless Singh tries his best to make the reader understand the gist of the proof. Definitely an interesting read.
B000035Z3K|5.0|This DVD features the original 1931 classic horror flick, \\"Dracula\\" directed by Tod Browning. It was considered the most frightening film of its day but nothing to scream about by today's standards. The DVD features include commentary by film critics, the theatrical trailers and the addition of Phillip Glass' music by the Kronos Quartet ensemble. As a bonus, this DVD also includes the Mexican, Spanish version of the film.  This is a must have for fans of classic horror. Let's take a look at why Dracula was such a big success and why today, the vampire legacy he planted is still very popular in literature, art and cinema.<br />It was 1931. The Great Depression was only three years old since the Stock Market Crash of 1929. Cinema had been around since the turn of the century, with the silent films of such directors as the Lumiere Brothers and D.W. Griffith. Silent film stars were the Hollywood celebrities of the day- silent film actor Rudolph Valentino, who was a sex icon, swashbuckler Douglas Fairbanks, seductive and exotic Theda Bara and of course, the comedian-actor Charlie Chaplin. In silent film, visual scenery created real atmosphere and the physical, slapstick, body language and facial expressions of the actors played the most important part in making the film seem real and engaging. Yet, there was still no sound. Music could not be heard nor the actor's voices, so the whole thing looked remote, distant and even alien to audiences. Not until \\"The Jazz Singer\\" did sound enter the world of cinema. Finally, actors could be payed to speak. By the time of Dracula, everything was set to electrify audiences with a horror film. Horror was not new at this time in film. Lon Chaney was the leading horror star actor of his day in the 20's, though they were mostly silent films. He was called \\"The Man Of A Thousand Faces\\" because he could transform himself into so many guises as different grotesque characters. When Tod Browning's Dracula came along, Lon Chaney had died and it was time for a new face of horror- Bela Lugosi.<br />It is Bela Lugosi who really makes this film work. Many viewers who are so young their earliest memories are of the 1980's won't appreciate the subtlety in horror. Today's horror film is all about graphic and gratuitous violence, excess of blood and bodily harm as well as shallow teens who are in danger by some malevolent force. But Dracula started the vampire film business in the first place. He paved the way for the future vampires of our modern day like Anne Rice's Lestat. We have to look at this film in the context of its time. If it's dialogue and acting may apepar tacked-on and stilted, it's because it was taken directly from a play performed on Broadway. Bela Lugosi's heavy Hungarian accent, his wicked eyes and grin, his nocturnal, caped eveningwear, the way he says \\" I am Dracula\\" and \\"I never drink wine\\", his bodily manners and movements all contributed to the making of the first Dracula. He would always be seen as Dracula, for it was the only movie that made him a star. He would star in other films as Dracula. He even requested to be buried with the caped costume.
B00011RPB0|1.0|I watched this movie for 2 reasons- first I'm a big Bill Murray fan, and second, the movie had all this hype around it with it's praise from critics and the awards it had recieved. I was bored within the first 5 minutes but I just figured that it had to get better... WRONG! Nothing happens!! It just shows Bill Murray and Scarlett Johansson looking bored all the time, which makes you bored. There is no story line or point to this film. Don't buy this if you are looking to be entertained, or moved.
B00011RPB0|2.0|I expected great things of this movie but unfortunately, it did not live up to its hype. It was a one-note film, full of angst, and had no plot.I had read that there were some funny parts, but they must have been cut out of the version I had!<br />And Bill Murray, nominated for a best-actor award...all he did was mope around with a long face and bassett-hound eyes!<br />What a depressing, dull movie!
B0000CFW87|5.0|Josh Groban has the most amazing voice I have heard beyond the walls of any theatre. Though it is common to hear a tenor similar to him on Broadway, I rarely have the privilege of listening to it at home. <br />Using Italian lyrics, Groban accentuates his already incredible talent. You can hear the passion and emotion in his voice as he sings each word. Even while singing in English, Groban has no trouble maintaining his continually improving and already solid vocal technique. I would say we are witnessing the beginning of a future Luciano Pavoratti. <br />Groban's talent is one of uniqueness. Though his albums are often considered to be pop or contemporary, he could easily walk on a Broadway stage and still bring tears to his listener's eyes. Regardless of whether Groban is a pop idol or Broadway star, I expect nothing less than amazing things from him in the years to come.
B00005JMJ4|4.0|As a mainstream film this must be a rare example of its type. The plot, such as it is seems incidental to the situations in which the characters find themselves. If you have been abroad on business as I have, you will recognise many of the scenes. If you haven't you may find yourself wondering what the film is about...<br />Calling home... two Germans talking while you wonder why you are alone... flicking through foreign language television stations... being dazzled by the sight of an unfamiliar landscape from your taxi... drinking on your own at the hotel bar... These and many more will be familiar to all the &quot;suits&quot; that travel by plane every day.<br />Necessarily for such an atmosphere-biased film, the end left you wanting more, but not knowing what. Having said that, it was great while it lasted... very relaxing.
B00005JLK1|5.0|First off, this film wasn't scary, but very unpredictable and many scenes were unexpected.  I love to watch this movie over and over again.  It was great.  The wire scene was incredible and cool.  This movie had everything-blood,gore,big explosions,violence,good acting and was fast paced.  The wire scene is the best opening scene, along with D-Day in SPR.  If you are easily scared and hate gore, don't see this.  Buy and enjoy.
B0000C7PSW|5.0|Given to me by Santa, this CD took a little while before it really became a fave of mine.  It takes a little getting used to, and for me, I had to know the songs before I really got into it, but now it is a regular in my cd player.  I just saw Rufus live in Chicago a couple of days ago, and, amazingly, he is better live than on his CDs.  If you love his music, I highly recommend seeing him live.
B000003S0I|5.0|&quot;Larks' Tongues In Aspic&quot; is King Crimson's aspiring masterwork from 1973. By this time, the band had gone through nearly half a dozen line-up changes in less than four years with guitarist Robert Fripp being the only mainstay through it all. In late 1972, Fripp hit upon something special when he assembled a fresh new line up to record this album. The line-up of Fripp, bassist/vocalist John Wetton, violinist David Cross, drummer Bill Bruford (who had recently left Yes) and percussionist Jaime Muir (who would leave King Crimson shortly after this album was made) became the band's second classic configuration and would create what many would consider the best material under the King Crimson band name.<br />&quot;Larks' Tongues In Aspic&quot; is bookended by its lengthy instrumental title track. The first part which opens the album is a nearly 14-minute tour-de-force which combines free-form experimentalism with jazz-fusion, classical and even heavy metal influences. It's quite extraordinary that the band can combine these many genres into one piece of music and still sound coherent.<br />&quot;Book Of Saturday&quot; is a simple 3-minute ballad which is quite the opposite of the previous track. Although King Crimson has never been a singles band, this track would have worked out great as one. It's melodic guitar parts and soaring vocal work from Wetton suit this songs contemplative mood.<br />The 8-minute \\"Exiles\\" sounds as if were an outtake from the first King Crimson album \\"In The Court Of The Crimson King\\". John Wetton's vocals have a sound reminiscent of Greg Lake while Fripp's guitar and mellotron work are straight out of \\"Epitaph\\" from the aforementioned album. Cross adds a definite Classical influence with his violin playing and also plays flute on this track (though it's not credited. Wetton also plays uncredited piano).<br />The latter half of this album is considered by many to be its most memorable as it includes the timeless Crimson classics \\"Easy Money\\", \\"The Talking Drum\\" and the second part of \\"Larks'\\" title track.<br />\\"Easy Money\\" has a slight blues influence and deep groove which leads into a solid group improvisation. Fripp gives a wrenching guitar lead here while Muir litters the track with various percussion abstractions and noises.<br />\\"Easy Money\\" leads into \\"The Talking Drum\\" which is a giant 7-minute crescendo beginning at an extremely low volume but builds until the track is literally screaming from the speakers. This track is a solid demonstration of the band's tight musicianship. Bruford, Muir and Wetton lock into a repeated rhythm pattern which Cross and Fripp improvise over. As the track reaches its peak, it cuts into a brief snatch of violin and guitar screeching which leads directly into the next and final track, \\"Larks' Tongues Part 2\\".<br />\\"Larks' Tongues Part 2\\" has remained an active part of King Crimson's live repertoire since it was initially released on this album. Like the previous track, \\"Larks' Part 2\\" shows of the bands high-class musicianship and their ability to stick together through radical dynamics and time signatures. Everyone in the band is in top musical form here. And you just gotta love that `trash-can' ending to this track.<br />With all due respect, \\"Larks' Tongues In Aspic\\" is King Crimson's second magnum-opus (the first being \\"In The Court Of The Crimson King\\") and is an essential classic for fans and musicians alike. The powerful musicianship and experimentation of this band is unparalleled. King Crimson continues to make inspiring music today with its current line-up. However, as mention at the beginning of this review, Robert Fripp did something special when he assembled the \\"Larks' Tongues In Aspic\\" line-up in 1972. That special something is forever preserved on this album.<br />A Progressive Rock Classic and an essential King Crimson title., \\"The Talking Drum\\" and the second part of \\"Larks'\\" title track.<BR>\\"Easy Money\\" has a slight blues influence and deep groove which leads into a solid group improvisation.

B00009V7P8|5.0|I actually first head Damien in a short commercial during Saturday Night Live with my friends.  We liked what we heard, so we immediatly started downloading the music to get a better feel of it.  Being in highschool, they had to go home only 10 mintues later for midnight, and so didn't get to hear what we had downloaded.  I stayed up 'till 3 and listened to and fell in love with every track.  Damien's voice goes perfectly with every song, and the cello is a beautiful and necessary touch.  A short while later, I bought the CD because I felt a little bad for downloading them all (it's one thing to download from Led Zeppelin and The Rolling Stones, but with little artists like Damien I always buy the CD) and didn't regret it, because if I hadn't I wouldn't have gotten the gorgeous case, complete with page after page of distinct artwork.  O is a must buy for any folk lover who adores heartfelt well written songs.
B0000CFW87|2.0|I looked forward to Josh Groban's second album as I absolutely <BR>loved his first.  His voice was so powerful, emotional and personal.  What I especially enjoyed was the way the music did not overwhelm or substitute for the vocals.  <BR>This album evocked this comment: &quot;My God, he's been Celine Dioned&quot;!  My partner, a musician, simply said: &quot;Sounds like songs<BR>on a hollywood sound track.&quot;   There are dozens of albums like this and they all sound the same.   <BR>I have a deeper appreciation of how a producer can make or break<BR>you.  I am a huge fan of Eva Cassidy, who, in part, never became <BR>famous in her lifetime because producers didn't know what to do <BR>with her wide ranging talent: jazz, folk, torch, ballad, etc. This album indicates a lack of appreciation for the voice by <BR>commercializing the &quot;product&quot; to the point of blandness.
B00008PX8P|5.0|Being influenced by thier music every day with bits and peices of Led Zepplin on the radio I realized that I knew nothing about them and decided to purchase an extra copy for myself when giving this masterpiece as a gift for a client.  He's a big fan and I wanted to know why.<br />I humbly say that this DVD has touched me in a way that no other band has.  I think of past girlfriends and the sun in their hair; grassy fields with the sweet smell of an accoustical guitar.  There are times where I no longer exist in my office chair-I'm in Yosemite sitting on my trucks tailgate-experiencing love and all of its stormy patterns.<br />If quality of sound is what your after than this is the album for you.  I work with high end speakers and of all of my demo material this one sets it self apart and people basically stop in awe of the qaulity of the performance, thier raw talent, and shocking quality in audio and video.  I thank this band for taking me to a place that I oh so often forget about.  <br />Thanks for reading.  =)
B000070IXT|2.0|Well well well... what have we here? Ah an intersting bit of trite marketing to 14-16 year old boys... interesting. What happened to the highly anticipated artsy horror film that the maestro of zombie movies was supposed to make? I for one am very curious as to why the studio canned Romero and instead brought in the &quot;oh so talented&quot; director of Mortal Kombat. What a crock of sheckles; I have had the privelage of reading a draft of the script by Mr. Romero and let me tell you that that film would have been a million times better than the mindless fodder that ended up on the screen. <BR>I love George A. Romero's films, particularly his dead trilogy. It hurts me deeply that something beautiful could have been made and wasn't out of the deeply involving and original Resident Evil video game saga.<BR>Well kudos to the studio for raping and pillaging a very artsy and wonderful videogame series. My deepest sympathies to George A. Romero for the studio's injustice. Hopefully someday a different director and smarter studio will do this series justice.
0385510438|3.0|Grisham just seems to have run out of literary steam. A Time To Kill, and his novels through Pelican Brief, keep the reader interested and curious in the action, the people, and the outcomes. The characterizations and dialogue are lively and sharp. The Last Juror, even with the first person perspective feels distanced and uninvolved. I finally broke down and bought it because some editorial reviews promised hope of the old fire, but I'm putting it back on the market and re-reading some old Dick Francis stories....
B00005JN08|3.0|Come along for the mis-adventures of Scotty & 3 of his friends, who decide to back-pack across Europe to find the woman of his dreams. If you enjoy a wild, care free,(and sometimes raunchy)Summer movie (even though it was released in February)you'll like this one. I'll have to admit, Eurotrip is DEFINATELY a guilty pleasure & may not be for everyone. Be forewarned....It's a movie about partying high school kids. Sex, drinking, loud music, sex......electric testicle clamps. WHAT???!!! Lol!<br />Eurotrip was filmed on location across Europe (great scenery), & has cameo appearances by Kristin Kreuk (Lana from Smallville), Matt Damon, Lucy Lawless (Xena), Fred Armisten (SNL), & one of those chicks from \\"Absolutely Fabulous.\\" <br />...It's destined to become a classic in it's genre' of teen movies.
B00005JMJ4|1.0|I am at a loss as to why anyone would like this film.  It is the sad story of a long married man, alone in a strange city, where he can not speak the language, with no friends to communicate with, &amp; a young married girl in the same situation having been abondoned by her artist husband for a few days.  Bill Murray's character wants badly to jump the girls bones but can't/doesn't.  When he does get the chance to get laid, its by the lounge singer in the hotel they are staying at.  It was a boring 105 minutes of film for me.  If he wins for best actor at the Oscars next week, I will eat my hat.
0385504209|1.0|This book was a relatively quick read and just barely enough of a mystery to keep me going to the bitter end.  But there are so many problems with it.  Like other reviewers, I had many of the clues figured out long before they were revealed.  The premise of the book--and the various aspects attached to it--are so totally absurd as to be laughable.  The end was disappoiinting.  And, as other reviewers before me have pointed out, the author's &quot;facts&quot; are anything but accurate.  I can only assume that Dan Brown is trying to be sensationalistic (for the sake of monetary gain?) in his &quot;revelations&quot; about Christ, the Catholic Church, paganism, the Nag Hammadi, the Dead Sea Scrolls, Mary Magdalene--not to mention Da Vinci and his works, along with other famous artists, scientists, etc.  How does Brown figure his &quot;facts&quot; are more valid that the thousands of scholarly works which are in conflict with his book?<br />Since many reviewers before me have pointed out specific contraditions of Brown's revelations, I won't do so again.  I must say, however, that I am appalled that so many readers are so ready to be taken in by Brown's assertions that the things he writes are true.  Many reviewers have written that their &quot;eyes have been opened.&quot;<br />Wait a minute here.  Just about any author, film maker, TV executive--or man/woman on the street--knows that controversy sells, and sells BIG. Dan Brown certainly knows it.  And he's getting rich while he trashes religion, distorts truths, tarnishes reputations and destroys faith.  He's anti-Christian and wants all of us to join him.<br />My advice:  For Heaven's sake, don't be so gullible!  Take this book with a grain of salt.  If it makes you doubt your beliefs, find out the truth for yourself.  Don't take Dan Brown's word on it.
B000002UCQ|4.0|This song alone is worth Ten times More than what the CD costs. Of course the whole CD is great ( CD # 2 is debatable ), But Isnt it a pity Has to to be the most sweetest, beautiful gorgous melodys i have heard in years. Its perfect. All things must pass confirms that George Harrison isnt and never was \\"The quiet Beatle\\". He was a talented and peaceful soul. That very soul was in every song on this CD. So, If you want to get in touch with the soul and many talents of George Harrison, Buy this CD. Its as close to his soul as you are going to get...
B000002N25|4.0|If only for one of the best love songs ever, &quot;A night in Summer Long Ago,&quot; this is a gem of an album.  When I saw Don Henley touring his &quot;Inside Job&quot; cd he came out for an encore and performed that song as an anniversary present for his wife.  It's that good.  &quot;Darlin Pretty&quot; and the title cut are great, as well.  The rest of the cuts are somewhat pedestrian but Mark's never been one to really consider cutting edge.  I still listen to it every few months or so, just to hear that wonderful love song.  Enjoy.
B000093BDX|5.0|It's time to hit the beach yet again. Imagine yourself putting on your hawaiian shirt, shorts, flip flops and jumping in your 'ol woody with surfboards on the side and on top and heading down to the sand and surf to catch a wave. That's the feeling you get when you think of The Beach Boys and their historical legacy. Opening the case of the CD practically makes you hear the waves and the sounds of the ocean. The guys from Hawthorne, California became the American version of The Beatles, and gave them a run for their money. There wouldn't be a group if it weren't for the genius of Brian Wilson. A man who ranks along with Lennon/McCartney as one of the top composers of all time. This disc is A LOT better than the greatest hits package released previous to this one. There's more songs here and it's a bigger bang for your buck. There are 30 tracks on here and the music journey is exhaustive. The disc kicks off with \\"California Girls\\" and \\"I Get Around\\", and their first hit single, \\"Surfin' Safari\\", which charted back in August of 1962 at #14, is the third track. Their first single, \\"Surfin'\\", isn't here. Should of been. Amidst the group of songs that seem to be about water, surfing, girls, cars, and everything else sunny, there are deep moments here from the Wilson psyche. \\"In My Room\\" sticks out the most. It's a song with lyrics that are a sharp contrast to the norm of the other songs. My favorite song has to be \\"Don't Worry Baby\\". I think it's about as picture perfect as a song could get. The 26th track, \\"Do It Again\\", which was a top 20 hit, is another top favorite. It wasn't as huge a hit or as remembered as others, but it features one of Wilson's finest grooves and catches. An underrated gem. The set gives you the bare essentials of the Beach Boys' work. From their first hit in 1962, to their last charting hit, \\"Kokimo\\", which hit #1 back in November of 1988. This is the best single disc collection of the Boys' hits. Hardcore afficiondos will want more, but anyonelooking for the bare bones collection that sweeps thru most of their hit making decades will want this one instead of forking over a ton of money for the boxed sets. \\"Getcha Back\\" was a worthy return to the Beach Boy sound back in 1985, and it was also a top 20 hit. The also cover the Chuck Berry chestnut, \\"Rock And Roll Music\\", but it seems that every rock and roll band from that era at one time or another covers that song. I've heard better versions. They also include their cover of \\"Come Go With Me\\", a cover that I prefer over the original. The genius of Brian Wilson is undeniable. His ear for harmony and the perfection of chords, choruses, and beats, is legendary. We must also give credit to Mike Love, who wrote or co-wrote a good chunk of these songs too. Some people only hear happy, sunny music and think nothing of it, but they always fail to really hear the brilliance of one of the finest musicians/singer/songwriter/composer heading up one of the finest bands in music history. There is a lot more material here to go over, but it would take too long. It covers everything you would want from \\"Barbara Ann\\" to \\"Wouldn't It Be Nice\\", from \\"Good Vibrations\\" to \\"Help Me Rhonda\\" and beyond. As the Amazon review stated, this is the best well rounded hits disc that beats the recent releases from Elvis and The Beatles. There you have it. Hit the sand and hang ten!.
B000002ADT|5.0|This is by far my favourite jazz album of all time. I was first introduced to when I was a fifteen year old school boy saxophonist, and I loved it immediately. I remember my sister leaning into my room and whispering to me, 'this is quality music, Tom'. The soloing on this album is about the closest thing to any true definition of great music you will ever hear.  There are so many magic moments on this cd. I remember a jazz critic, John Fordham pointing out such a moment - when the drum crashes after the melody statement on So What and Davis begins to solo - as typical of great jazz and great music. Each solo is gem and represents the best in modern jazz of any era.
B000001DYA|5.0|Crank it up and watch the neighbors close the doors and shut the windows. Blue Cheer are the inovators of Metal, that is the fact and nothing else matters. Dickie Peterson was and still is the man with his southern drawl and screams that are un matchable. He is out in Germany right now playing his butt off and still sounding as loud and raw as ever with his new group. Leigh Stephens had to be one of the loudest players I ever heard and Paul Whaley on drums with a mountain of drums so big you could barely see him on stage. In 1969 I was at one of thier shows at the Whiskey A Go Go on the Sunset Strip in Hollywood, and in the middle of the second song the management pulled the plug cause they were so Loud. Needless to say the place started to riot and there went all those lovely Marshall amps that Leigh had stacked. Dickie said after the show, ah Sh-t man this happens all the time!
B00005JL7Q|4.0|This is a story about a coming of age for someone who is still selfish acting like a boy at the age of 38.<br />The irony of a young lad who has a feeling for the important things influencing a change in a grown up with no feeling for anything but himself.  Through out the movie, Grant's character Will is getting closer and closer to being an honest person with some meaning in his life.  It takes a young boy with a need, Marcus, to shake that lose in him.<br />You can read the othe reviews about what he was up to originally, yet the touching part about the movie is how much Will grows to care, to care in general for someone and something without looking for anything in return.  Isn't that really where life has meaning anyway.<br />The movie is an attempt to teach that by caring we can help others in ways that even we do not understand.  This movie is brilliantly cast and produced.  You wonder if you are going to shut it off at first, yet the humor in the movie keeps you going until you just enjoy the plot and the story and you get to hoping that something gets better for someone.<br />This movie gives hope to those who may have nothing.  Marcus is the teacher, the one with the can do attitude.  If we could be like children when it comes to relationships our world would be so much better.
B00005JMJ4|1.0|I have noticed several 5 star reviews all from &quot;A viewer from USA&quot;, this seems like quite a coincidence that with such a rash of 1 star reviews we have a spate of 5 or 6 perfect reviews all from people with the same description.  It is a shame that the few who actually liked this film have to resort to in essence stuffing the ballot box in order to keep the score inflated.  There are many poeple who reply on these ratings before deciding whether to spend hard earned money and it is a real diservice to them to write multiple reviews under false pretenses. I hope in the3 future amazon will require a different sign on for each review.
156898443X|5.0|I loved every moment I spent with this book, from the gorgeous cover to the heartfelt drawings and journal entries throughout.  Well done, Danny Gregory.  Not only can you draw, you have inspired another to do the same.
B00005JMJ4|1.0|I have checked back and it does appear that some guy is writing like a dozen 5 star reviews one after another.  Take them out and you have like 8 one star reviews out of every ten reviews.  I wonder if some flack has invaded this normally open and honest forum.
B000092Q4U|2.0|I have american new gospel by lamb of god and that  cd is realy amazing but as the palace burns is the worse metal album i heard so far...

B000002PCS|5.0|Simply put, this is some of most beautifully crafted music you will ever find.  From the original &quot;Somewhere In Time&quot; theme, to the rendition of the Rhapsody, to the beautiful track &quot;A Day Together,&quot; one can hardly feel unsatisfied by the emotion that pours out in this music.  An even bigger treat is to actually watch the film and see how the pieces of music are so brilliantly married to their corresponding scenes.  I was fortunate enough to pick up the Gold Masterdisc version of this years back.  Unfortunately it's now out of print but I highly recommend to lovers of this soundtrack that you search for it on <BR>Ebay because the transfer and sound quality is magnificent.  <br />How powerful is this music?  To me, it almost sounds at times that it came down from heaven itself.  It's more than music.  It's a journey into the soul.
B000002UR7|1.0|Pablo Honey is a pretty bad album on it's own, but compared to Radiohead's later work, it's terrible! It's what has always made popular music disgusting; pointless, predictable, commercial rock. Kid A, Amnesiac, and Hail to the Thief are absolutely brilliant, and OK Computer is undoubtedly the best rock album ever. Thank God Radiohead changed. Get Kid A. That's where I started and since then I have become a huge Radiohead fan.
B00012L786|5.0|In the booklet that accompanies this DVD, Martin Scorsese writes, &quot;if you don't like the films of Sam Fuller, then you just don't like cinema. Or at least you don't understand it.&quot; It's a bold statement-one that sums up the attitude of Fuller's movies. He was a filmmaker who could never be accused of being wishy-washy on any topic. His films take forceful stances on a specific issue, be it Communism or war or personal honour. They are stripped-down, straightforward masterpieces that pull no punches. Pickup On South Street was Fuller's unflinching take on the Cold War. Even though he made the majority of his films within the studio system, very few have been released on DVD (or on video for that matter). The Criterion Collection previously released Shock Corridor and The Naked Kiss with excellent transfers but only theatrical trailers as supplemental material. They've rectified the situation with this new release that features a solid collection of extras providing a fantastic introduction into the cinema of Sam Fuller.<br />Aside from the movie there are some top notch extras included:<br />&quot;Sam Fuller on Pickup On South Street&quot; is an interview with the filmmaker by film critic Richard Schickel (taken from an longer piece he did for Turner Classic Movies). It's great just to hear Fuller tell anecdotes in his trademark hardboiled delivery-a passionate, gravelly voice.<br />&quot;Cinema Cinemas: Fuller&quot; is an interview with the man that originally aired on French television in 1982. The closest we get to an audio commentary on this DVD is footage of Fuller watching the opening reel of Pickup On South Street and gleefully talking over the footage.<br />&quot;Headlines and Hollywood&quot; is a well-written essay of Fuller's life and career that provides excellent insight into his background as a tabloid journalist that informed his movies.<br />&quot;Recollections from Richard Widmark&quot; is an interview with the film's star, taken from Lee Server's book, Sam Fuller: Film Is a Battleground.<br />Also included are trailers for nine of Fuller's films. They all look fantastic and make you instantly want to see each and every one of them.<br />Finally, there is a collection of stills from the movie, a poster Fuller filmography and illustrations by Russell Christian that accompanied the screenplay of the movie when it was published in Scenario magazine in 1998.<br />The Criterion Collection has come through again with a stunning transfer that beautifully restores this film noir classic. For people who haven't had the opportunity to see any of Fuller's work, this is a great introduction into his hardboiled, un-sentimentalized world.erver's book, Sam Fuller: Film Is a Battleground.<br />Also included are trailers for nine of Fuller's films.

B000092ZYX|5.0|Popular music today is so horrible... music has become a complete novelty. Rap (or hip hop or whatever) is a perfect example. Rap, having no musical quality whatsoever, is a status symbol, just like what clothes people wear. And then there are the record companies, who choose who gets popular and who doesn't. And who do they usually choose? Avril Lavigne singing about &quot;Sk8r Bois.&quot;<br />At least there's one band that chooses originality over popularity. Hail to the Thief is a perfect follow-up to Radiohead's brilliant experimentation with Kid A and Amnesiac. It seems to be a mix of them and OK Computer, with the darkness of Kid A, the strangeness of Amnesiac, the emotion of OK Computer, and a side of Radiohead never before seen. Hail to the Thief has more grooves and flowing drums than their earlier work, A Punchup at a Wedding being a good example.<br />There There, a personal favorite, is a beautiful, almost spooky track that starts out very rythmical and suspenseful, and ends up with Radiohead's trademark choatic guitar sounds. Sail to the Moon is a very slow, stripped-down track, showing Radiohead's ability to use simplicity to make a great song. And then there is Go to Sleep, probably the best rock song I've ever heard. I could go on and on describing the genius in each track, but I'll sum up the review by saying Radiohead has done it again, made an album that is stunningly creative in a world of pointless, meaningless music, if you'll even call it that.
0676973779|5.0|Loved it!  Was not on my radar as I try to avoid overly popular books,aka Oprah Book Club.  However it was selected by a memeber of my book club & I thoroughly enjoyed it.  Bloody parts & all. Get it and pass it around until it falls apart!
B00005JMJ4|1.0|As much as I like Bill Murray, I could not keep my attention focused on this movie. I couldn't even stay awake the first time, and had to keep munching popcorn to make it all the way through the second time. I watched it the second time to make sure I hadn't overlooked or missed something. Fact is, there's nothing to overlook or miss. The only interesting thing was the maze of lights and electronics shown in downtown Tokyo. Your money is better spent on a travelog of Japan than on this meaningless, go nowhere movie.
B0000DD7LB|1.0|Okay, here's what Britney has got going for her, #1 she's willing to do anything for money, even if it means dressing like a complete tart and #2 she's pretty so young girls look up to her.<br />Anyway, the album. I listened to this at my 7-year-old cousin's house, and I was digusted! All the songs are inappropriate, especially &quot;Touch Of My Hand&quot;, and as usual, the rest of the songs (&quot;Early Mornin'&quot;, &quot;Brave New Girl&quot;, &quot;Toxic&quot;) are the same trahs Britney has been trying to sell since the start. She hasn't matured at all! I am upset my cousin is listening to it. Yes, I'll admit she has a smart producer that makes her songs catchy and great to dance to, but she'll all hype, that's all.<br />Please, don't waste your money on tasteless trash that objectifies women and gives the wrong impression on how to dress for preteens and teens. TRUE musicians sing live, write their own music (without assistence that do most of the work!) and sell their music, not their body. <br />Britney is on her way out. If you want a pop album, buy Christina, because at least that girl can SING and often does it live. Or buy Micheal Jackson. He dances far better than Britney!
B0000AQS0F|5.0|You can get a better synopsis from any of these other reviews, so I'll just throw out a few thoughts. Release the hounds!<br />A show that takes 'space, the final frontier' to its logical conclusion. A show with nine equally interesting main characters. A show in which a man can be put through an engine and come out clean the other side (well, more 'hamburger' than 'clean'). Firefly is all of these things, and more...<br />Firefly takes place in a universe where colonies are neither domed cities nor idyllic paradises waiting for bright-eyed, stouthearted men and women to move in. Life is as it has always been on the frontier of the moment: hard, gritty, sometimes violent and usually more than a little smelly. The 'haves' live on Core worlds, with most of the advances people usually think of when they think of The Future. The 'have-nots' live, for the most part, everywhere else. Oh, there may be a maglev train pulling into the station, but it's as likely there's a herd of cattle to be unloaded from it.<br />Firefly's main characters are each interesting in their own right. Black and white give way to nine different shades of gray, some (read that: Jayne) darker than others. Even relatively minor characters (such as &quot;Badger&quot;, a 'businessman' with A Very Fine Hat) seem to possess a life of their own, one that continues even after their scene ends. In just 14 episodes, this series introduced several secondary characters (Badger, Saffron and Early spring to mind) that I would be very interested to learn more about.<br />The first time I saw 'The Train Job', I knew that Firefly would be A Different Kind of Show. You don't push a (quite deserving) man into a spaceship's engine and then go on like you're so-called 'Must See TV'. The good guys don't wear white hats (in fact, they don't wear hats at all and aren't always that good). The gray areas of personal morality and ethics remind me of Star Trek: Deep Space Nine, although opportunities for moral and ethical fuzziness come up a lot more often on Firefly than they ever did on DS9. Point being, while they do have some broad, archetypal strokes (the Captain, the Mercenary, the Doctor, etc.), you quickly begin to notice how much fine brushwork went into these characters. They seem like real people, and I can't think of higher praise for fictional characters.<br />Misc Points:<br />  * No sound in space (it takes you aback at first, as you wonder if your fancy Surround Sound system just gave out)<br />  * Bathrooms (Star Trek has no bathrooms; a Federation toilet is as mythical as a Romulan Jumping Bigfoot)<br />  * Laser guns are expensive and rare (and an old-fashioned slug-thrower will make a man just as dead)<br />If you like DS9, Farscape, Buffy, Brisco County Jr., Gargoyles, Millennium... I think you'll like this show. 673 people can't be wrong! (Actually, it's quite possible we're all wrong, but after watching the first episode, &quot;Serenity&quot;, I think you'll find that the odds start to stack up in our favor.)<br />I won't even bother making crude allusions about the FOX executives, their parentage, their intelligence or their personal habits. It's obvious they've done that themselves.<br />Keep your hopes up. With talk of a soundtrack and a movie, it's quite possible Serenity will keep flying.zziness come up a lot more often on Firefly than they ever did on DS9.

B00000IPAX|4.0|When I listened to this album for the 1st time . I knew Blink 182 reached a new high . Plus it was the 1st album with Travis Barker who is so much better than Blink's former drummer . I recommend this album to all Blink , punk and music fans.
0440237688|4.0|I first read this book back in 5th grade, along with a few of Lowry's other books, and it still holds the same amazing results as it did that first time I read. Why? Because of the picture she paints with her words, asking you kindly to imagine her world, a terrifying world of equality. Imagine a world without colors, music, smell, anything at all that makes life enjoyable now. You're not allowed to date, not allowed to do what you want, and not allowed to have hopes and dreams of your future, as your future is already chosen for you. It's scary, yet thrilling all at the same time. To imagine this is amazing, to think of it is ingenious. The idea is purely terrifying, the idea of such an equalized world that it would take out everything that makes it worth living, makes it exciting. I fear a world like this, yet it sparks my imagination.
B00006690G|3.0|It seems like Eminem has just fallen down the path of all rappers now rapping about the same topics as all other rappers out there. What happend to rappin' bout' shrooms, etc. on his first album? Quite the shame that someone so different and revolutionairy conformed only 3 albums into his fading career.
0811826848|5.0|I can't say enough about how great this book is. I ran out the day it went on sale and bought it. The photos are fabulous, and I can't say anything that hasn't been said already. However, they are typically vague on the Pete Best controversy. I did have a great laugh at Ringo's recollection of seeing John and Yoko nude on the &quot;Two Virgins&quot; LP cover! A Beatle fan must.
B00000G3AZ|4.0|'Emma' is your chance to catch a great set of actors and actresses on their way up, before they became big.  In 1996, Gwyneth Paltrow was better known as either (a) the daughter of Blythe Danner and Bruce Paltrow, or (b) Brad Pitt's one-time fiancee.  In 'Emma,' she rolls out her pitch-perfect English accent for the first time, to be used again over the next couple of years in 'Great Expectations,' 'Sliding Doors,' and ultimately in her Oscar-winning performance in 'Shakespeare in Love.'  'Emma' is a chance to catch a young Paltrow before she became one of those special &quot;owned by the world&quot; people identifiable through a single name.<br />'Emma' has another rocket as well: in a small role, there's Ewan McGregor.  'Emma' was made contemporaneously with *his* breakout performance in 'Trainspotting.'  Make a movie with Paltrow and McGregor today, and it's $20M for starters just to pay the co-leads.<br />A third treat:  Toni Collette, back a bit to 'Muriel's Wedding' persona - she's added a few pounds here to portray the role of wallflower, Harriet Smith.  As usual, she's spectacular.
0385510438|5.0|As an aspiring journalist I love the way Grisham wrote &quot;The Last Juror&quot; from the point of view of a young, green newspaper editor!  It was a refreshing turn from his usual main characters, the lawyers.  The suspense of the trial and the ensuing events were not the focus of the story as it implies on the cover (a mistake that was no doubt made by the copywriters and not Grisham himself), so do not get your hopes up for a real thriller like &quot;A Time to Kill.&quot;  However, the emotional pull between Willie Traynor and Miss Callie more than make up for the mishap of the cover teaser.<BR>I am severely disheartened by the fact that so many people are giving this novel poor reviews.  In my opinion, &quot;The Last Juror&quot; is one of the freshest novels I have read in a long time and the choice to approach the legal system from a different point of view was a magnificent choice on the part of John Grisham!<BR>I couldn't put it down!!!
0393320928|2.0|Yes, Feynman was brilliant. Yes, Feynman revolutionized the teaching of physics. Yes, he seems to have been a delightful, charming, handsome, womanizing, fun guy to hang out with. But the Feynman cottage industry ran dry a long time ago. I expect his grocery lists to be published any day now to feed the insatiable hunger for anything that he touched. The essays and articles in this book are bland and nearly worthless. One is introduced as &quot;uproarious.&quot; Uproarious is defined as &quot;provoking hilarity.&quot; If you think anecdotes about Feynman running up a stairway to bring his heart rate up are hilarious, you are easily amused. This book was a complete waste of time and money.
B00005ASHM|5.0|an album of epic proportions. mentioned in just about anyones top 5 albums of all time. the production quality is bar none some of the best ever heard on an lp. can you imagine dreaming up something as delicate and melodic as this? i cant. brian wilson almost certainly motivated lennon and mccartney to create some of their finest work. if it hadnt been for brian wilson i dare say that the lennon-mccartney machine would have become complacent with making second rate music and rest on their laurels. it propelled them and the world is a better place for pet sounds.
0553213105|4.0|I'm a recent newlywed who decided to raid his wifes bookshelf and this was the first book of hers that I picked up. Wanting to be better read and enjoying the movie &quot;Sense and Sensibility.&quot;<br /> I recommend to anyone that is curious but apprehensive of Austen like I was to see a film based on one of her books. You will hear the use and cadence of victorian speech which will, in my humble opinion, make her books more accessible and easier to read. This is the first Jane Austen I've read and I am now bonafide fan.<br />This is one of those stories where the destination is not important but the journey is. Within the first ten pages, the stage is set. The two headstrong protagonists, Miss Elizabeth Bennet and Mr. Fitzwilliam Darcy cannot stand one another at the beginning of the book. Sparks fly and meet with typical results. The characters are distinct and memorable. Mr. Bennet, Elizabeth's father, was one of my favorites. Anyone who is an admirer of dry &quot;british&quot; humor will find themselves in stitches. It is the first book in a very long time where I found myself laughing out loud and on more than one occasion.<br />A moderately quick read for those used to victorian prose. I for one am glad that I got over the &quot;girly&quot; stigma that's usually associated with Jane Austen. It has made me consider other books in my wifes arsenal I normally would not have otherwise.<br />I will, however, pass on her &quot;The Divine Secrets of the Ya-Ya Sisterhood&quot;<br />Great book. Enjoy.
B000002NHN|5.0|I have never heard of Loreena Mckennitt in my whole life. I hardly even listened to newage music before. However, I listened to the preview of the songs to this CD and it opened a door for me. I bought this CD and &quot;the vist&quot;. &quot;The Book of Secrets&quot; is definitely the better of the two in my opinion. The instruments were great. Very powerful when played in conjunction with Loreena's voice.<br />1. Prologue <BR>Not bad, but it didn't really hit me like the other songs.<BR> <BR>2. Mummers' Dance <BR>This song has a great melody playing throughout. Vocals were also good.<br />3. Skellig  <BR>Very very soothing string work in this song. Top knotch.<br />4. Marco Polo  <BR>This song is a nice change. It's more suited for the percussion fan, but still enjoyable.<br />5. Highwayman  <BR>Again, awesome string work at the start. This was the highlight of the song for me.<br />6. Serenissima  <BR>What can I say? The strings are again a hit. A very soothing instrumental.<BR>      <BR>7. Night Ride Across the Caucasus <BR>Like most of the songs on this CD, this song has a great intro and the vocals fit in quite nicely. The song has good percussion work here, but it's not as heavy as Marco Polo. The strings too, do a great job.<BR>       <BR>8. Dante's Prayer<BR>No better song could have been used to conclude this CD. The way that Loreena sung this song was by far the best in this piece, especially when the piano and the strings come in. Very moving stuff. Great lyrics.<br />This CD had a very good mix between the vocal and instrumental elements, which is why I thought that it was better than &quot;The Visit&quot; which is more vocal orientated. There is nothing wrong with this ofcourse, as it depends on the taste of the person.
B00002MZ2C|5.0|what can I say, Rage Against the Machine is AWESOME. with great lyrics and insane guitar riffs make rage's music  complete. it pissed me off when they called a quits because really they were pretty much the only band left with integrity. oh well, what are you going to do I guess. ok to finish: the cd is amazing, the band is awesome, and you don't have it or aren't buying it right now because.....?
B000002L75|4.0|Some Great Reward takes the first big step towards more mature sound and lyrics. Blasphemous Rumours is one of the greatest songs crafted by DM. The breathing at the end gives an eerie feeling that would be felt during Black Celebration. Master and Servant and People are People, along with Blasphemous Rumours, are the highlights of SGR. The only flaw in SGR is that some of the tracks feel as if they were not completed. Other than that, SGR contains some of DM's finest work and my all time favorite DM song, People are People.
B00000IP4H|3.0|It's quite a bit different from Practice What You Preach, that's for sure.  I have mixed feelings about this direction Testament decided to take with this.  I don't know why they felt they had to become borderline death metal.  It actually kinda seems juvenile.  I mean, I never bought a Testament album saying to myself, &quot;Boy, I sure wish Chuck Billy would growl.&quot;  I think I speak for most Testament fans when I say that Chuck Billy's voice is one of the big reasons we like the band.  Why change the style now?  Chuck's growls are kinda corny anyhow.  They were fine when he would do it every once in awhile on older albums, but doing it for an entire album is lame.  As far as the music goes, it's also a break from traditional Testament.  It's not bad, it's pretty friggin heavy actually.  But it seems like they were trying too hard to modernize themselves in a way.  The formula's pretty brutal, but pretty repetitive at the same time.  Plus, it never seems to kick into really high gear.  The entire Legacy album is faster.  Basically, I would like this alot more if it wasn't Testament, or if it was done as a Testament side project.  It's a worthy addition for a hardcore fan, just done be expecting to pop it in your player as much as their other albums.
B00005JN08|5.0|If you are under the age of 30, or at least young at heart, and have always loved movies like European Vacation and Airplane you will enjoy this movie!<br />I have seen it two times since the release.  The simple plot is made up for in big laughs.  The movie has smooth transitions and has many small but very memorable characters.  For example, the very strange and peverted Italian man on the train is something I don't think will ever forget.  \\"Mi scusi!\\"<br />A great advantage of this movie is that it introduces some new but really great actors.  I see Scott Mechlowicz doing great roles in the future.
0385504209|1.0|I won't even go into the historical or theological inaccuracies of this hack piece of work. What I will tell you is that this \\"novel\\" is his previous work, \\"Angels And Demons\\", just with different character names.<br />The beginning involves the murder of a prominent intellectual figure by a secret society. The book's main character, Robert Langdon, a Harvard Sybologist (semioticist?) is yet again brought in to assist on the esoteric clues left behind.<br />We have Langdon yet again thrown in with a female character who is related to the murder victim. He has to deal once more with thick-headed law officials possessing no imagination. Once more there is a race against time...<br />Reading this book was a bad case of deja vu!<br />Mr. Brown, please think of a different plot and more complex characters for your next novel. Also (most importantly), do better research if you're going to continue doing these so-called \\"religious/conspiro\\" thrillers.

I see Scott Mechlowicz doing great roles in the future. Also, the Matt Damon cameo was interesting... I didn't even spot him the first time.<br />I don't wish to seem melodramatic, but Eurotrip is the most hilarious film I have ever seen. I only wish I could reserve a copy on Amazon right now! <br />The movie could've lived without the molesting Italian, and it would've been stronger with more than one fully developed female character. It even offers scores of male frontal nudes in a beach scene that turns into a riff on zombie movies. It's in keeping with the movie's cheerful homophobia and its sunny misogyny. Still, Eurotrip is sort of admirable: Unlike its peers, it's tired of talking about sex and is ready to have some.
B00005JMJ4|2.0|This movie absolutely bored my wife and I to death. It was very slow starting out and continued to drag on throughout the movie. We didn't finish watching it because we fell a sleep. I give it a 2 because I like Bill Murray.
B000001Y2U|5.0|This album may have outraged thousands, but at the same time, it provoked far too many into looking within the lines and asking questions.  It's clearly evident that Manson was fueled with much more than hate and sappy agnst when he created this album, and he doesnt just spend our listening hour bashing things here and there and cursing his way to a top selling album. No, no, he takes us into his disturbed mind and shows us the different way of looking at life, the one that no one else seems to be able to come up with or want to even hear.   The first time i saw the CD, back when i really didnt even know who manson was, i can honestly say i was struck with a feeling that was mixed between fear and disgust.  It was that viewing of artistic tragidy. But being a girl, i guess people program you to be offended by things like that.  And one of the coolest things about this album is its 'story.' Which is based on the main character (the worm,) who spends its entire childhood in fear and pain and judgnment it cannot escape, and eventually, when it grows up, it sheds its skin of self-doubt and weakness, to becomes the monster, the angel, the antichrist.   Obviously a personal story of how manson himself was a weiner of a little boy and grew up to be a strong powerfull person, it also shows how when things are abused and given pain, they grow up to abuse others and give pain to others.  The more you listen to the lyrics the more you'll find the interconnections that fabricate this complex story.  Now, The album sounds like a mix of NIN and abstract recordings and is very strange and makes you think about things. And as always with Manson, his songs always sound a lot different, never ever would you hear two manson songs that sound the same. okay okay......here are the song ratings themselves    Irresponsible Hate Anthem 6/10  okay this one is kind of strange and it dont really like it becuase its too brash and the lyrics were kind of sad.  i did like the stomping 'i hate thehater, id rape the raper' he seems to hiss at your    The Beautifull people 10/10 an obvious hit and its so catchy you could listen to it all day long! it has that intoxitcating drum beat and Manson's fluziating and wonderfully disturbing voice  Dried up....8/10 very interesting and buzzy with a heavy metallic chourus    Tourniquet 100000/10 love this song!! its my absolute favorite on this CD.  Its a slow combination of low humming basselines, shreiking vocals, hard-hitting drums, and no evident sign of lead guitar.  its very sad and poetic and manson shows how 'you never ever belived in me'    Little horn 8/10 not my favorite but its very strange so i like it.  sounds a lot like somehting from the Potrait album for some reason.      Crypochid 9/10 yes a lot of people dont like this song becuase its just a wierd electronic hum with women-like vocals.  the lyrics of it are very interesting and they pretty much encompass the main theme of the album    Deformography 6/10 i dont like this one very much becuase its annoying and i find it too monotonous.  i just like the 'youre such a dirty dirty rock star' riff    Wormboy 15/10 cant really explain why i love this song, i just really like this song.  it has a really abstract guitar line and while the bass line really pounds it on most of the time, it never sounds heavy and usually ends up sounding very goofy with the strange guitars and manson's intentionally silly vocals.  the lyrics are also right up front and really make a lot of good sense.    Mister Superstar 9/10 okay i must admitt i really only like this song becuase of some of the 'interesting' lyrics it provides. such as 'hey mr. porno-star/ i i i i want you. hey, mr. super-f**k/ i wanna go down on you    Angel with the Scabbed wings 8/10 very nifty riff and tamborines    Kinderfeld 7/10 a very personal song i can tell as it accounts the dirty parts of our hereo's childhoold. this song is very slow and doesnt really go anywhere, but for some reason i find thissong very captivated    AntiChrist Superstar 9/10 dont know why this song got the title becuase it doesnt even use the words the entire time.  Hard to get into, but once you do, it gives you the feeling like you are at a rally or something.  Creepy and dark as you hear manson hiss the lyrics like 'Prick your finger it is done the moon has now eclipsed the sun...' followed by yelling 'REPENT.'    1996 9/10  very good song lyrically and it shows the popular side of our rocker that he is so well known for.  it should be titled anti-christ superstar, seeing as how that is the main riff used in it, and the song is almost entirely all the things he is agianst.  'anti-boy and anti-girl, i am the anti-flag unfurled.'    Minute of Decay 8/10 very slow and filled with that creepy vibration.  the vocals make it sound lke he he is actually in your head, the way it sounds unedited is a very good touch.    The Reflecting god 100/10 very very good song and is an epic really.  its sounds really long but only about 5 minutes.  the lyrics are once agian pure genious.  love it so much!    The Man that You Fear 10/10 creepy and intelligent and filled with so many interesting sounds.  everything from, what i believe is, manson's piano work, to echoing noises at the begining.  the lyrics are once agian very well thought out and beautifull.    great album, but as you can see, im kind of picky about the songs  on here, but they are really good anyways.  Not only does this rock and create a massive feeling to its listener, it is insightfull (reading his autobiography really made me realize this) and intelligent.  Say what you want but this music has real taste and substance.
0790744295|5.0|This movie is great! That is if your into cheesy movies! Alot of people get the wrong impression about this movie, its not scary! Non what so ever, but it is so much fun! <br />Fathers Day: Fathers Day is about a woman who kills her father on fathers day. The reason why she kills her father is because he is ranting and raving about getting his fathers day cake. so she takes a...I don't know what it is... and smacks him with it. She buries him in her yard and she moves and someone else moves in (it doesn't show this but it basically tells you). Every fathers day she comes back to the spot where she burried him. Now this is where it starts showing. she goes and visits him and he comes to life (the people are awear that the woman is there). she gets killed, and the people in the house are sick of waiting, so each of them go out-side..one by one...and all get killed off...well sorta! just watch it! <br />The lonesome Death of Jody Verrill: To make a long story short...This one is about a meteor striking and turing some guy, jody verrill (stephen king), into a weed. This one is pretty funny! <br />Something To Tide You Over: A rich guy strikes revenge on a guy for cheating him out of his money. The guy, and his girlfriend, that he kills comes back to life and they then get revenge on him.<br />The Crate: Is the longest story of them all. so, as you can tell from the tital of this one its about a crate. and in that crate is some sort of evil monkey/monster thingy. and the other part of this story is about a man that cannot stand his wife (niether can I) and he see's this crate and the animal in it. he tells his wife to come down and help him and the monster gets her! so basically its about a guy that is trying to kill his obnoxious wife! <br />They're Creeping Up On You: is the story that makes the movie! A millioniar hates bugs, and keep in mind that this man is mildly evil, and to make a long story short he his invaded with cockroaches. it is pretty gross and this one is probably the reason why this movie is rated R!
0385424736|5.0|This was an outstanding story about an above average law student who just wants to make his mark.  He just wanted to earn an honest living, but Rudy Baylor had more curves thrown at him that most people would just run and hide after the first pitch.  Grisham has young Rudy ready to take on the world, and boy did he ever.  I use to work for an insurance company, and I was never very fond of the insensitivity and cold-hearted poeple of the business, and now I hate 'em even more.  Well, Rudy goes after &quot;Great Benefit&quot; Insurance and their large team of lawyers.  What a ride!  There are a couple of other cases Rudy is dealing with aside form the Great Benefit case.  Without telling you the story, it has an ending that I didn't quite expect.  I loved this Grisham Novel! <br />(I never saw this movie)
0671027344|5.0|Words cannot describe how ABSOLUTELY amazing this book is. Stephen Chbosky's wonderful style of writing pulls you into charlie's world withouta doubt. the book was imaginitive and interesting. I have read it twice, the first time about six months ago and the second the day before yesterday. both times I could not put it down and finished it in a single day. by the time I closed the book the second time. I was ready to read it again. I only wish it had gone into Charlie's Sophmore year. it was just not enough. It leaves you wondering what Charlie's doing now, how Sam and Patrick are fairing at college, and whether or not Charlie still feels &quot;Infinite&quot;. I highly recommend this book to anyone who is, or has ever been a teenager coping with the every day struggles of highschool, friends, romance, and life in general.
0780622650|5.0|If you still have the heart of a child and a sense of wonder you'll love this. Some are too &quot;adult&quot; for this type of movie, but it's got the same style of fun that comic books, Ray Harryhausen, and Irwin Allen used to serve up. Nothing earth shattering, but fun. A lot of the characters are far more interesting than they used to be too. In the old show I was never sure why the women were there accept to make lunch.
B00004RJ74|1.0|Every flick I've ever seen of this weirdo is frightening, not in a &quot;spooky-frightening&quot; way either, I mean he's frightening in a disturbing way. I believe he's a murderer trapped in a society that doesn't allow murder. Hollywood is his release, but I wonder how long that will satisfy him? Anyhow, about FROM DUSK TILL DAWN, it could have been a good vampire flick. It just seemed to me there was too much senseless dialog, cursing, violence and way too much blood. Yes, I know it's a vampire movie, it's just that it felt too over the top with all the heavy blood baths, horrible murders, bad acting and nerve-racking psychotic behavior!<br />I cannot, in good conscience, recommend this sickening film.
B00005JLXE|4.0|Not a great movie and not an awful one. Part of the problem is that they tried to make Daredevil a typical popcorn special effects movie and at the same time have it all be different from typical popcorn special effects movies. The guy who said Daredevil has no weaknesses missed all the pain pills Daredevil takes plus he yanks his own shattered tooth out. No other super-hero in a movie is quite this vulnerable, but they have him doing all kinds of comic book stuff and it's an odd contrast. Daredevil tries to do too much too fast, but it's entertaining and I liked the real side of him. With the glut of super-hero movies it was nice to see one who bleeds and feels and is a little more raw than most.
B00005JMJ4|1.0|With all the hype that this movie got, I forced myself and my spouse to watch it to the end hoping (in vain) that the misery we had endured thus far would be rewarded by some fantastic finish.... which never came.<br />Undoubtedly the most boring movie I have ever seen.  <br />Perhaps I disliked the movie because I could not identify with it.  I feel sympathy for those who could, as what tragically boring lives they must lead. <br />I wish I could return this bomb, but the BS no return policy on software and dvd's that retailers force on consumers prevents me.
0385512104|5.0|Fifteen-year-old Christopher John Francis Boone, the narrator of Mark Haddon's Holmesian-titled Curious Incident, comes upon his neighbor's dog late one night lying dead in its yard, run through with a pitchfork. After hugging the dog for precisely four minutes, and after being accused of the animal's murder by its distraught, pajama'd owner, Christopher determines to investigate the mystery of the canicide. What makes this task particularly challenging, however, and what sets this book apart, is that Christopher is autistic. Though he is able to communicate and he is unusually intelligent, Christopher's disorder renders simple activities--talking to strangers, traveling by public transportation--often prohibitively difficult. (Christopher cannot interpret facial expressions well, he cannot abide being touched, and his moods are governed by the colors of the cars he sees en route to school. But he excels at math and science and can, for example, rattle off a list of prime numbers up to 7,057.)<br /><br />In addition to undertaking to solve the dog's murder, Christopher writes down the story of his investigation in the form of a novel--The Curious Incident itself--a book whose sparse but highly readable prose ends up being about far more than a single dog's death. In passages alternating between real-life events and Christopher's scientific and mathematical musings, the curious incident of the pitchfork-pierced dog is explained, further deceptions are revealed, and the reader is introduced to an extraordinary mind.<br /><br />Reviewed by Debra Hamel, author of Trying Neaira: The True Story of a Courtesan's Scandalous Life in Ancient Greece
B000003TA4|2.0|Let me break this down, in a rather incomplex fashion, for all who are either considering the purchase of this CD or just reading the reviews to gripe and moan.  Nirvana, while rebellious, offered NOTHING new, or even creative to the musical landscape of this or any other era.  I understand, and even empathize with all the 'tortured souls' out there, but Cobain didn't speak to you. In fact, he loathed you, as he did all of his loyal fans.  That's the catch twenty two with an anti-everything group such as Nirvana.  In following them, you are actually defying all that they stand (or stood) for, and thus become the antithesis of their idealistic contemporary or true fan.  In fact, by worshipping Nirvana, you actually become the very enemy that Cobain sought to destroy.  Learn this, and accept it.  <br />Secondly, the music (please, stop pleading otherwise) was diluted, poorly constructed and almost completely lacked any semblence of complexity OR beauty.  His lyrics were NOT poetic, or abstract, or other-wordly, they were simply the lyrics of a disgruntled and nihilistic elitist.  I also seriously shouldn't need to call any attention to the complete lack of adeptness or training with which Cobain attempted to play the guitar.  Let's simply say that his ability on guitar was less than passing.  In addition, the rest of the band members were also hardly virtuoso's.  So, you can cease in claiming that as well.<br />Thirdly, an album's greatness depends solely on its ability to persevere.  The longevity of an album (inspect this postulate, it shows in what we now consider to be 'classic') is also completely dependent on the diversity of sounds and styles which the album employs.  Time has repeatedly shown this.  And, needless to say, Nevermind, and all other Nirvana albums for that matter, are about as diverse sonically as a ceiling fan.  That's three strikes Nirvana fans.  Yep, (0-3).  So...<br />I'll leave you with a sagacious word (advice, if you will) regarding a better musical path which it isn't too late to pursue.  For the love of God (if one exists) heed my call, the world will experience a profound change for the better if you do...<br />If you are planning on picking up, or playing, or praising, a Nirvana CD, and are doing so because:<br />1. You despise society, and all that the archetypal American stands for, then you should listen to these albums instead:<BR>     The Velvet Underground - The VU and Nico or White Light/White Heat<BR>     The Mothers of Invention - Freak Out! or We're Only in It For The Money<BR>     The Fugs - The Fugs<BR>     Elliott Smith - Elliot Smith or XO<BR>     Radiohead - Amnesiac, Kid A, OK Computer, The Bends or Hail to The Thief<br />2. You have a mild aversion to consumerism and/or love poignant, heartfelt lyrics, then pick up these albums instead:<BR>     Leonard Cohen - Songs of Leonard Cohen or Songs of Love and Hate<BR>     Wilco - Summerteeth or Yankee Hotel Foxtrot<BR>     Bob Dylan - Highway 61 Revisisted, Freewheelin', The Times They Are A-Changin Blonde on Blonde, Another Side of Bob Dylan, or Bringin' It All Back Home<BR>     Billy Bragg - William Bloke or Talking with The Taxman About Poetry<BR>     Nick Drake - Pink Moon or Five Leaves Left<BR>     The Beatles - Sgt. Pepper's, Revolver, Abbey Road, White Album, Rubber Soul etc.<BR>     Yo La Tengo - I Can Hear The Heart Beating as One or And then Nothing Turned Itself Inside Out<br />3. You love heavy rock music and feeling angsty or contemplative, or love gruff or non-traditional sounding vocals, then you should listen to these albums instead:<BR>     Television - Marquee Moon<BR>     The Flaming Lips - Zaireeka, Yoshimi Battles The Pink Robots or The Soft Bulletin<BR>     Captain Beefheart - Safe As Milk, Lick My Decals Off Baby or Trout Mask Replica<BR>     Billie Holiday - Lady in Satin or Songs For Distingue Lovers<BR>     Van Morrison - Astral Weeks<BR>     The Pixies - Surfer Rosa<BR>     Morphine - Cure For Pain or Yes<BR>Tom Waits - Rain Dogs or Swordfish Trombones<BR>     Jeff Buckley - Grace or Sketches for My Sweetheart The Drunk<br />4. You simply love a great guitarist, then pick up these albums instead:<BR>     Leo Kottke - My Feet are Smiling, Greenhouse or 6 &amp; 12 String Guitar<BR>     Robert Johnson - King of The Delta Blues Volumes 1 and 2<BR>     Jeff Beck - You Had it Coming, Blow by Blow or Wired<BR>     Dillinger Escape Plan - Calculating Infinity<BR>     King Crimson - In The Court Of The Crimson King or Starless and Bible Black<BR>     Built To Spill - There's Nothing Wrong With Love or Keep It Like A Secret<BR>     The Jimi Hendrix Experience - Are You Experienced?, Axis Bold as Love or Electric Ladyland<BR>     The Yardbirds - Over Under Sideways Down or Having a Rave Up<BR>     Wes Montgomery - Smoking at The Half Note or Full House<br />5.  You just love well arranged, complex, moving or eclectic music, then pick up these albums instead:<BR>     The Zombies - Odyssey and Oracle<BR>     The Move - Shazam<BR>     Charles Mingus - Pithecanthropus Erectus, Mingus Ah Um! or Oh Yeah<BR>     Broken Social Scene - You Forgot it In People     <BR>     Miles Davis - 'Round About Midnight, Steamin', Cookin', Sketches of Spain or Kind of Blue<BR>     Art Pepper - Plus Eleven or Meets the Rhythm Section<BR>     Love - Forever Changes or Da Capo<BR>     The Byrds -Notorious Byrd Brothers, Turn!

If you really desire something profoundly lyrical, read some poetry.  I would suggest Theodore Roethke, T.S. Eliot, Allen Ginsberg or Ezra Pound to any Nirvana listener,established or potential, (or basically to anyone for that matter).
B00005JKGZ|1.0|Such an adorable little girl, it's just so cute how she goes round assaulting and abusing defenceless old men, and almost derailing trolleys, nearly murdering hundreds of innocent pedestrians - ahhhhh... the good old days. <BR>Quite possibly sowed the early seeds for today's abundance of youth crime and lack of discipline in society.<BR>Charming and quaint it is not. <BR>Tedious, oversentimental nostalgia with frankly appalling clothes (who would really wear that bow?) and bangs from the devil.
B00000DGUY|2.0|I realize that they had to edit this CD in order to put all the tracks on it...that's clear. My advice to all of you is to do what I did. Download all of the full versions of every song on the album minus &quot;Private Investigations&quot; and &quot;Local Hero/Wild Theme&quot;. Leave those 2 songs off and you will have enough room on your blank CD to put the rest on it. The reason for eliminating these 2 tracks is....1. &quot;Private Investigations&quot; has no beat or rythym to it at all and is a boring song...and 2. &quot;Local Hero/Wild Theme&quot; is a cover of a solo working by Knopfler, so why is it even on here. Go buy the album &quot;Screenplaying&quot; if you want to hear that song. Do this and you will have a perfect Dire Straits &quot;Best Of&quot; CD.
B00005YW4H|5.0|I love this Cd.I could listend to it anytime! :) She is very talented!I cant wait to see what other albums that she will have in the future!Shes got alot going for her!
0385510438|4.0|Not one of Grisham's best, but it was OK.  The Thursday lunches at Miss Callies kept me hungry enough to read more.  It is a good read, but doesn't compare to Grisham's earlier work.
0140177396|4.0|Overall, John Steinbeck's Of Mice and Men is really a good book.  Even though it's rather short, it delivers its message quite well.  The book opens with George and Lennie near the Salinas River south of Soledad, California.  Lennie is a big, loveable guy who isn't very smart, but is easily pleased.  Lennie loves to stroke soft things, and has a mouse in his hands that he accidentally killed by petting it too hard.  Lennie's portrayal is extremely sympathetic and sentimental, but I couldn't help but like him, regardless of his flaws.  George is the little man behind Lennie; he acts as the big man's brain in guiding him and keeping him out of trouble.  The two travel and work together and have a friendship unlike anything most other characters in the novel have ever experienced.  The book really got me to feel like I knew the characters, especially Lennie, and to pity them.  The underlying theme of man's innate loneliness and his need for companionship is a bit dark and pessimistic for my taste, but is delivered tactfully with the repeated story of George and Lennie's farm where Lennie will be able to tend rabbits while the two live off the fatta the lan' offers hope so the book can be easily stomached by someone with a more optimistic worldview.  All things considered, I would definitely recommend this book for everyone to read; the ideas behind it should be considered by all.
B00005JMJ4|1.0|If you've had trouble falling asleep, this is the film for you.  I hav'nt seen a film with this much action since Andy Worhals Empire State Building.  I've worked in Tokyo under similar circumstances and had an exciting and eventfilled experience.  These principle characters come off as a couple of dull folks from the USA.   Why all the fuss about this film?  Somebodies pockets must be getting lined.  And I'm a big Bill Murry fan.  I'd rate this film 0 stars and 5 ZZZZZs.
B00018D44U|2.0|Wake me when it's over. Great voice but so what. Cutsy pablum with a country twist. How refreshing. <BR>TIP: Nellie Mckay debut kicks this to pieces!
0385504209|1.0|From [...]<br />The Da Vinci Code is a fictional work. Notwithstanding the book's marketing promotion and its pretension to authentic scholarship, the truth is that the novel distorts the historical record about Christianity and the Catholic Church and gives a wholly unrealistic portrayal of the members of Opus Dei and how they live.<br />For example, the Da Vinci Code presents as fact the absurd notion that the fourth century Roman emperor Constantine invented the doctrine of the divinity of Christ, when in fact the New Testament and the very earliest Christian writings manifest the Christian belief in the divinity of Christ. Likewise, the novel asserts that it was Constantine who chose to include the four Gospels in the Bible, when in fact they had always been recognized as authentic.<br />The Da Vinci Code likewise gives a bizarre and inaccurate portrayal of the Catholic institution Opus Dei. The numerous inaccuracies range from simple factual errors to outrageous and false depictions of criminal or pathological behavior. For example, the novel depicts members of Opus Dei practicing gruesome corporal mortifications and murdering people, implies that Opus Dei coerces or brainwashes people, suggests that Opus Dei has drugged new members to induce religious experiences, and insinuates that Opus Dei bailed out the Vatican bank in return for its establishment as a personal prelature. All of this is absurd nonsense.<br />In short, the Da Vinci Code is a work of fiction. Promoting it as anything more would be dishonest to the novel's readers, and disrespectful to the faith of millions of Catholics and other Christians.
B0000VAFO0|2.0|Kate Beckinsdale is a vampire \\"death dealer\\" who just takes it out on lycans (read:werewolves) in this dark gothed out city. When it becomes clear that the wolves are stalking a human for some reason, she defies her annoying,sexually harrassing, vaguely trent reznor looking, vampire boss and investigates on her own to find that the wolves are trying to make a vampire/wolf hybrid and royally piss off all the old racist vampire types.<BR>Everything bad you've heard about this film is true. So is everything good you've heard. It really depends on a) You being able to suspend your disbelief mightily even within well-worn vampiric film conventions b) being able to put up with exceptionally crappy werewolf CG effects and c) getting past some of the worst acting in a modern hollywood release recently, including the normally charming Kate Beckinsdale in the lead role, who just looks bored and faintly embarrassed to be reading these lines. Really though, we've seen much worse crap than this in horror/action crossovers and despite the above-listed major problems, there are some genuinely fun moments, to laugh at if nothing else. I thought it was hysterical that thrown out as an afterthought at one point, it is mentioned that vampires don't really drink from humans anymore but subsist on artifical plasma. Not that the factoid advances the plot in any way, but I'm sure some exec hand wrote it in there because how else are you gonna make a crowd sympathetic to a man-killing female vampire? \\"Underworld\\" won't start any new players to White Wolf's \\"World of Darkness\\" RPG's (of which this has been accused rightly I believe of ripping off) but it's not gonna make you despise it either. It actually gave me some hope. See, it made some halfway decent money apparently. Perhaps now with more money spent on actors, CG, and script, a sequel set in this world could turn out to be quite entertaining. So, I'm a relentless optimist when it comes to vampires, so sue me.
B00005B36H|5.0|I bought Lateralus when it first came out, nearly 3 years ago, and still listen to it constantly. It is without a doubt, my favorite album (Aenema is probably second). During a time when most (mainstream) music is predictable, trendy and filled with &quot;ear candy&quot; hooks, Tool comes along and blows everyone else out of the water. It's hard for me to try to compare Tool to other bands people not familiar with Tool, may be familiar with, because Tool is too unique and too complex, and this album (Lateralus) epitomizes that uniqueness. It takes you on a long journey with hypnotic melodies, and &quot;trance inducing&quot; (as the 'official' Amazon.com review said) lyrics. I would highly recommend this album to anyone looking for an excellent piece of music to explore, or anyone looking for something new and unique.
0792164903|5.0|Sleepy Hollow is an awesome movie. Its dark and yet it seems to have a hidden humor about it (mostly thanks to the talented Johnny Depp)  Johnny Depp, as in all of his work, protrays his part perfectly.  The is not only scary, but also magical and a little romantic. And the costumes are beautiful! Especially the Stripped dress shown in the last scene!
0790734850|5.0|I was raised in Los Angeles during the 1950s and this is one of the very few movies that capture the look, feel, and character of the city at that time. The acting is stunning and the DVD transfer is razor sharp. Jerry Goldsmith's superb score terrific and the locations, particularly the &quot;Formosa Cafe&quot; and the Bunker Hill area flop houses are particularly authentic. What I have to say about this great film has been said by the many reviews here already.  I wanted to add that this gem is brilliantly adapted from the great novel it came from with awesome authenticity. Intricate, brilliant, action-packed and mysterious all at the same time. An easy five stars!!
B00008H2LB|5.0|Well first of all this CD is great and LP is a great band.  And for all of you with all this \\"I hate nu-metal\\" and \\"this is rap not rock\\" [stuff] just stop.  Who cares what it is.  If you like it, that's great.  If you don't, listen to something else, and leave the rest of us who like their music alone.  I also noticed that everyone who liked the CD had a lot of great things to say.  While others who didn't wrote two lines and then stopped.  And it was all the same [stuff] written over and over again on top of that.  Please stop wasting our time.  ...   Oh and another thing, stop mentioning these idiotic bands that no one has ever heard of and have barely made it out of their garage as good bands.  LP is a great band, they have great CDs, they are great in concert.  I, along with many others, prefer not to waste my time with ranting and worthless yelling of groups like ICP, Mudvayne, and any other bands who prefer to see how loud they can yell and the expense of no one ever understanding what the ... they are saying.  So please if you like this band and this CD put reviews that reflect that, and if you don't that's ok, ...   Well that's my two cents, so I am off to listen to Meteora
B000022TSH|5.0|This is simply one of the finest films EVER made. It is MY personal favorite film of all time and was judged one of the top 25 best films of all time by the American Film Institute for very good reasons.  First of all, the script is brilliant.  This film was MADE to be owned, since on first viewing the spectator won't realize that EVERYTHING in the film, down to the pictures on the walls and seemingly off-handed remarks by the characters are PART of the story. In  one line from the film, Noah Cross says &quot;.... you may THINK you know what you are dealing with, Mr. Gittes, but believe me, you don't&quot; and that statement could not be more &quot;on target&quot;....  This movie gives the viewer clue after clue along the way.... but one should NEVER rewind or go back until the entire movie is viewed.... but absolutely play it a second time a week or so later... and suddenly you find the clues, the lies and the deception stands out in bold relief.  I have seen Chinatown at least 25 times over the years... and it still fascinates me.  Nicholson deserved the Oscar for this film. Dunaway was sultry and marvelous. John Huston was absolutely convincing as Noah Cross, the man with unlimited power and even Diane Ladd, in a minor role as &quot;Ida Sessions&quot;... a small time &quot;working girl&quot; was perfection.  The DVD transfer is not perfect... I would say it is a 9 on a scale of 10, some fuzz here and there and some background noise in the quieter parts... but overall it looks clear, color corrected and clean. The soundtrack by Jerry Goldsmith, although composed in a week, is probably his best score.  THIS FILM IS NOW 30 years old and we deserve a 2 disc boxed set with the COMPLETE score (the CD soundtrack only has about 35 minutes of SOME of the cues) and we deserve some still frames, some information about WHERE the scenes were filmed and so forth.  ON the Criterion release on Laserdisc several years ago, you could see the entire film with ONLY the music score (L.A. Confidential has that feature on DVD)... this one would be terrific to watch that way.  Overall... this film is a MUST have for any fan of film noir and cinematic perfection.
B000002KK2|5.0|I'd set this record aside many years ago, for reasons I can't quite explain. Recently, I sat down for another listen, and this is what I found: Twenty-five years after its release, this recording still jumps right out of the speakers, grabs you by the heart and won't let go. I was reminded of the astonishment I felt the first time a stylus touched this particular vinyl in 1979 -- an unknown singer-songwriter called Rickie Lee Jones had in her debut album created a masterpiece, a pop music classic. Today, it sounds every bit as fresh, confident, mature and as utterly original as it did a quarter of a century ago. I'll skip all of the specifics covered so well by others, and say, if you haven't heard this record -- or not listened to it for some time -- you should do it now, if not sooner.

0790730960|5.0|One of the great ones.  It's that rare sequel that goes one better on the original, and it goes to extremes.  Superheroics are an afterthought here; director Tim Burton is clearly more interested in his characters and their own dark, twisted inner worlds.  It was so in the first film, but here it's taken to an entirely new level; these three people are nakedly vulnerable, always on the edge of a breakdown (it's no accident that Rick James' &quot;Superfreak&quot; is heard during the masked ball).  It's not too coherently put together, but it's profound and emotionally complete.  Features Michael Keaton, Danny DeVito, Michelle Pfeiffer, and Christopher Walken, all in top form.
B00006RYIQ|5.0|Maybe it was the copious amounts of drugs consumed during recording, maybe it was the endless budget, maybe the influence of the producer Thomas Jefferson &quot;Madman&quot; Kaye, or maybe just the enormity of the talent packed between the grooves, but No Other is truly Gene Clark's masterpiece.  In it, he is mystical, beautiful, spiritual, moving, funny, dramatic, tuneful, spare, overwrought (I could go on, but that's just the first song!)  Spare further reading and considering whether you should purchase or not, this is a must-have for any true music fan, anyone open to the flights of boundless and visionary risk-taking in music that seems to have gone the way of bell-bottoms, mood rings and, er, Gene Clark.
B00005JMJ4|5.0|People who give this film  1 star or wish they could give it negative stars need to either start watching movies or stop writing reviews.  <br />I can understand if something doesn't jibe with certain people's sensibilities, but COME ON!!  ENOUGH WITH THE \\"WORST MOVIE EVER MADE\\" cliche.  \\"Dude, Where's my Car?\\" is a piece of crap; so is \\"Troll 2\\".  \\"Lost in Translation\\" is nowhere near this category.<br />Life is indeed full of long moments of quiet reflection with very little action.  The moments that are important are what creates the stories of our lives.  But by portraying the dead time in between these moments, Coppola makes a piece of art that's not simply there to stimulate bodily nerves (Which I think was her reason for showing Scarlett's ass in the begin, just to fool you morons into thinking that there would be plenty of tang to go around) but to make you think and contemplate the boredom and loneliness in your own lives.<br />Get this notion of \\"entertainment\\" out of your heads, kiddies. The great films don't simply entertain.  You don't read \\"Hamlet\\" or \\"Leaves of Grass\\", or listen to Mozart just to be entertained.  You do it because it moves you on some level buried deep inside where your conscious mindset can't see it.   That's why we're capable of falling head-over-heals in love with someone in a dream only to wake up and realize we never lived that life at all; Or you can have the capacity to find beauty in the simplest of objects right outside your very window without needing that simple objects to give you a lap dance; or you can have an intimate connection with someone without sex and without ever seeing that person again. These feelings stem from the source and is created in the form of \\"art\\", and it's the artists job to tap into these unknown realms that seem strange to every untrained and unimpassioned slob who dares call this \\"The worst movie ever made.\\"<br />All slobs who sit around and let the television think for them have to drain the silicon out of their minds and get off their sex-saturated materialistic asses for half a second, and realize that these higher states of being do exist in the world.  This is life, people, not your \\"Idol\\" worship, or your explosions.

B00009V8Z9|5.0|Gavin DeGraw has proven that he has staying power, showing his enthusiasm and enjoyment of the business and music, seldom found in artists anymore. Gavin's powerful vocals prove worthy of attention, obviously stemming from his background in opera.  The piano skills follow close behind, with Gavin's double 'shot' of musical power dubbing him the next &quot;Elton John,&quot; &quot;Billy Joel,&quot; and the &quot;next big thing.&quot; This young singer is strong on and off stage, and before you would ever rate him as an artist, seeing him live should seal the deal. This young man is just beginning, and the world is ready for a musician like him.
B0000TG9E2|1.0|We bought this DVD for our daughter and quickly returned it. They first problem we had was when there was a walrus SMOKING A CIGAR? Thought it was odd for a children's movie, but got over it. Later in the film a butterfly is seen floating on a giant MUSHROOM, SMOKING A BONG?!?! <BR>It is hard enough to shield our children from the evils that exist in the world. We do not need to introduce them to [this] via cartoons in their pre-school years!!! Shame on you Disney!
B000001ZS4|5.0|A great Jarre album, and Equinoxe is only having a single bad track, and it is Part 2.<BR>I think the best two tracks on the album is Part 4 and Part 7.
0064409422|5.0|The Lion, the Witch, and the Wardrobe was a very good book.  I really love this book and highly recommend it to any readers who seek adventure, for it is full of it.  Four children; Peter, Susan, Edmond, and Lucy, are staying with a professor in England.  The youngest sister, Lucy, who is not much thought of by Edmond, finds a fantastic world through the back of a wardrobe. This fantastic and wonderful world is called Narnia.  Spreading the news of her find to her siblings is not very easy. They are finally convinced when they stumble upon Narnia themselves.  Their adventure continues as they find themselves fighting battles and working together to conquer evil. This story is an allegory of Jesus dying on the cross and defeating the enemy.
B00018D44U|5.0|The latest album from Norah Jones, &quot;Feels Like Home&quot; shows us a different side of a singer who clearly has some diverse tastes. Where her debut &quot;Come Away With Me&quot; was reminiscent of Jazz singers like Billie Holiday and Rosemary Clooney, &quot;Feels Like Home&quot; has more of a Gillian Welch sound to it, a feeling that's only enhanced by Jones' duet with Dolly Parton on the bouncy track &quot;Creepin' In&quot;. <br />But that doesn't make it any less spectacular. Jones' voice is still beautiful, her piano playing is lovely, and her backup musicians, The Handsome Band, are amazing. Fans of &quot;Come Away&quot; won't be disappointed, despite the change of style.<br />Something else that you see on &quot;Home&quot; that you didn't get before was more of Jones writing her own songs. Most of the tracks here are co-written, but Jones did write one track, &quot;What Am I to you&quot;, herself. I will say that Jones is no lyrical genius, but the lyrics take a backseat to the still hauntingly beautiful instrumental work, especially on &quot;Carnival Town&quot;, which has a nice string arrangement by the album's co-producer Arif Mardin.<br />So, to sum up: &quot;Feels Like Home&quot; is quite different from &quot;Come Away with Me&quot;, but it's no less great. Jones maintains the casual, relaxed quality of her music, and leaves fans more than satisfied. I can't wait to see what she comes out with next. Judging from this album, she can continue experimenting with whatever style she wants, and she'll still produce a wonderful work of art.
0380977788|4.0|The book is about a girl that moves to a house that has a door that connects her house to another house that looks the same as hers. In it she finds another father and mother that want her to stay with them. They kipnap her parents and she has to fight against them to get them back.<BR>I liked the book because it is very interesting and because it is about courage and what can we do for the ones we love.<BR>I would recommend the book because I think the book is different and exciting.  When you read it you feel like you are the one that is passing for all the adventures.
0385510438|5.0|&quot;The Last Juror&quot; may be John Grisham's best work since &quot;A Time to Kill.&quot;  If there is anything Grisham understands it is the small town south and the lawyers and judges who inhabit them. Here, he adds a three-dimensional 23 year old newspaperman, Willie Traynor, into the mix.  Willie is an interesting fellow, whom we see grow from a callow youth with a rich grandmother into a mature and responsible -- not to mention highly successful -- newspaper publisher.  The story turns on the threat to the jury that convicts him by a vicious rapist and murderer, Danny Padgitt, and the subsequent deaths of several of those jurors - shortly after Padgitt's parole from prison after only nine years.  Grisham gives us a clever, exciting story that is very different from what you might expect, in more ways than one.
B0000DJZAH|5.0|The sound is simply amazing. It is clearer than it ever was and you realize what a fantastic group the who were back then. Of course these new remastered versions are getting more and more expensive but they are definitively worth every penny. The extras are also very very good.
B00005OAIE|5.0|Before John Mayer burst onto the music scene, I was REALLY bored with what I was hearing on mainstream radio. &quot;Yeah, yeah&quot; and various ways of saying &quot;baby, i love you&quot; just don't cut it for me. I love John's &quot;smart&quot; lyrics and his rich voice. I've almost had to stop listening to this CD in the car just because I get so into what he's saying, I forget to pay attention...But anyway, he's at the top of my list and I reccomend him to anyone!
B00004Z400|5.0|There are certain people who wrote reviews for this album that completely ripped it apart and only gave it one star. It's easy to tear it apart when you don't even understand it. One reviewer wrote that the song &quot;pink maggit&quot; was just a cliche song that many bands tackle, dealing with the agony of High School long after they are out of school. The person wrote that review didn't understand Chino's real feelings behind the song. I read an interview one time with Chino where explained how he wrote that song to sort of goof on all the other bands who whine about High School, on purpose. He said that with that song, he wanted to paint a picture of being lifted up on people's shoulder's at school like he was some high-school heroe. He was going for painting an image that was very corny on purpose. It's a good song and witty, if you think of the irony.<br />anyways, the deftones are one of my favorite bands and show definate maturity on this album instead of conforming to the rest of the &quot;nu-metal&quot; hybrids out there. THis is one of the best album's i own. I love the lyrics and how metephorical they get. They're cryptic and mysterious, yet poetic, not empty like other bands.<BR>Digital Bath is my favorite track on the CD and probably the best simple four minute single i have ever heard. Yes, it was released as a single, but you will never hear another song like this. <BR>If you life your music mature and different, i would recommend this CD.
B000099T2L|2.0|First, don't get me wrong, because &quot;B&quot; certainly does have a smooth voice, but the writing was very bubble gum to me. Kelly's CD was by far much better than &quot;B's&quot;, as far as writing skills, or the producer chosen to write for the album. I think the only reason she won those grammy's is because she's &quot;hot&quot; right now, and being beautiful seems to have it's advantages in the music business. But there were definately a lot more female artist who's albums surpassed &quot;B's.&quot; Sorry &quot;B&quot;, but I'm just calling it the way I hear it. Keeping it real! Try harder on the next one.
6304913176|2.0|I first read &quot;SST&quot; in grade school, not so many years after the book was published.  I loved the book then and love it now.  But I cannot say the same of the movie.  A great many Heinlein and SF devotees eagerly awaited the film based on the naive expectation that the movie would resemble the book.  But the director said publicly after reading all of 40 pages, &quot;This is not the film I want to make.&quot;  Well, he should have made something else.<br />It's regrettable that Heinlein's estate signed with Verhoeven.  Apart from the near absence of the book's philosophical basis, much of the &quot;factual&quot; aspects are lacking: Skinnies are absent; Bugs excrete their own highspeed plasma (or something) into space; no bio-mechanicals; on &amp; on.<br />Despite the many lapses, this is an enjoyable film to watch.  By that, I mean &quot;To Look At.&quot;  The leading characters are extremely cinematic; Denise Richards is an absolute Babe; Caspar gets girls glassy-eyed.<br />And that's about all you can say for SST: The Movie.
B00000I2UC|5.0|Even though this is different than Darklands in the fact that it's faster paced and a little over produced it still is an excellent Album from the end of the 80's. Automatic is better musically structured and sonically superior to the inferior, strident, harsh, unlistenable, mish mash of PsychoCandy and miles better than the convoluted unmemorable Honey's Dead. Don't always believe reviews that slam a groups music, if it was up to these boobs the music these groups played would not progress and become redundant recycled rehashes; Pearl Jam, Hootie and the Blowfish, Matchbox 20 ect. are prime examples. Unfortunately Jesus and Mary Chain had a hard time finding a sound that was uniquely them, explains why every CD sounds totally different from each other. Frankly I personally find Darklands to be the best this group ever had to offer, the most complete and a darkly haunting masterpiece. Automatic is Darklands on speed fast furious and intense, the same type of songs (lyrically, musically) sped way up, it's pure enjoyment for anyone who loves feedback guitar! and a song that jams and is easy to listen to, unlike the ears bleeding, grating nails on the chalk board PsychoCandy!
B0000VAFO0|3.0|At least this movie looks great--although at times it's so darkly lit I couldn't see what was happening. It moves fast and sometimes it's hard to follow but for about 2 hours, it's worth the look. One curious note: although Kate Beckkinsale is a vampire, you'd never know it. She's just like some edgy, model-looking dame who occasionally jumps off a l5th floor balcony. I wanted more monster transformations, a la Howling. She's surly, moody and doesn't have much charisma. The hero is a real babe!
B000053VAZ|5.0|I think this is one of Johnny Depp's best movies. He is hilarious in this movie with silent Buster Keaton routines. It has a great storyline about a szizophrenic (sp?) and a dyslexic falling in love; but it's also about the relationship between the overprotective brother and his sister. Wonderful, cute little movie.
0440237688|4.0|The Giver, by Lois Lowry, was an excellent book.  It gave a lot of insight into what the world would be like if there was no love, and a rule and role for everyone in the community.  The main character, Jonas, is a young boy at the age of 12.  He is a typical boy, who loves to play with his friends, and is very bored of school.  When he gets chosen for his specific job in the community at the Ceremony of Twelve, it was no surprise.  Jonas's best friend, Asher, is a very loveable, carefree character; so much so that it almost makes the reader sorry for him because he cannot love.  I would recommend this book to people of all ages.
0440237688|4.0|The Giver is certainly an intriguing book that would most certainly challenge the perception and knowledge of any young adult who reads it. Through a young man named Jonas' journey into self-discovery and such profound incidents as seeing colors for the first time and feeling the horrid sting of true fear and pain in a world, which is so controlled and monitored that the people around him will never understand unless he finds the strength to share it with them. Showing us that a world of ignorance and perfection is by no means what it should be and forcing readers into considering their own reality and how the world around you must always be questioned, even presenting us with parallels into our current state of the world. Hopefully showing some young readers what it means to analyze the society around them and the barriers that societies build up, which sometimes must be broken.<BR>However, this is a mature book, even though it is a middle school reading level it deals with complicated situations and emotions, which some young readers may find upsetting and confusing. This doesn't mean it isn't a great book, but best for a mature young adult.  A great discussion tool and definitely a book some kids will never forget.

0440237688|5.0|I thought that The Giver was definately a good read. Although it wasn't particularly difficult to read, it was thought-provoking. The tale of a new community in \\"sameness\\" is one that I have not yet heard. It was totally original and gave new meaning and depth to my memories and of what I think of as my community and my way of life. In never having thought of the lessons learned in everyday life the way that this book proclaims them to be, I sat in a pure state of thought after completing the selection. The only books that I could think of that could possibly compare to this are Madeleine L'Engle's- A Wrinkle in Time, George Orwell's- 1984, and William Gerald Golding's- Lord of the Flies. All in which people are set apart in some way and begin taking on their own culture and ways of life.
B0001611DI|5.0|Why must Hollywood feel the need to remake classic horror movies?  The remakes of the ones from the '50s seem to come out OK (most likely because of the updated special effects), but I don't know if I'll even be able to watch the remake of this film.  I hate the fact that people will go into the theater to see the remake without watching this one first or even knowing that what they are seeing is a remake.  It just bugs me.  It's also sad that big studios can't come up with new and original plots and have to go and maul classics such as Dawn of the Dead and TCM.  But anyway, this movie is great and i can't wait to get it on dvd.
0385504209|4.0|Unlike many reviews I found the book quite compelling.Mystery, Crytography and riddles throughout kept your mind busy.With a plot of religious background it makes this quite a thinking person's novel. I strongly recommend it and will look forward to reading his other books.
B00005JMJ4|1.0|I am a big Bill Murray fan, but even that could not help me get through this movie.  I kept waiting for the movie to &quot;start&quot; but it never did.  And seeing that it is up for an Academy Award, I have to agree with those previous reviewers who say it's only because of Soffia Coppola's name. I thought this movie was boring, slow moving and it took 1 1/2 hours when it could have taken 30 minutes (if that) to get the point across.
630469654X|5.0|In medieval times, a young thief named The Mouse (Matthew Broderick) escapes from the dungeons from Aquila, led by a menacing Bishop (John Wood).  He is saved by a mysterious knight named Navarre (Rutger Hauer), who roams around with a hawk.  By night, however, she is a charming beauty (Michelle Pfeiffer) and he is a wolf.  The two are in love, but are cursed by the Bishop.  So, with the help of a former priest (Leo McKern), The Mouse is determined to help them break the curse and destroy the evil Bishop.<br />I really love this film.  It's one of my top favorite fantasy films of all time.  It's also a childhood favorite; they used to show it on the ol' family channel right after Neverending Story.  Nostalgia aside, this is a wonderfully made film.  You have a traditional medieval story about starcrossed lovers, epic battles, beautiful locales, and humor along the way.  I especially liked The Mouse's misconceptions about God and towards the end of the film, he finally has an idea of what's going on.  The acting is quite good, especially considering the main three stars were up-and-coming; Broderick just got off of doing WarGames and Ferris Fueller before taking the role.  Hard to believe that Rutger Hauer wasn't the original choice for Navarre (it was reported that Kurt Russell was originally selected to play the part) because he makes the role all his own.  It's also nice to see him play a hero role, too; for a long time I thought of him as the psychotic replicant from Blade Runner.  Of course, Pfeiffer is excellent as she is beautiful, too.<br />Richard Donner, best known for helming the Lethal Weapon series, directed and co-produced.  His wife, Lauren Shuler, produced the film.  His directing style here is actually different from most of his films, allowing the beauty of the old landscapes and the fight scenes to be portrayed properly.  The screenplay is top-notch, which is no surprise since one of the writers wrote Enemy Mine and the other contributed to the Superman series.<br />Probably the only quarrel I have with it is the music score by Andrew Powell (one of the members of the Alan Parsons Project).  I actually liked the score, especially with its jaunting theme, but one critic described it as &quot;disco-medieval.&quot;  I can't agree more.  It screams the 80s so well that a contemporary score set to a medieval picture seems very inappropriate.  Still, a good score despite what people say.<br />Overall, I highly recommend this fantasy film to anyone that likes the genre.  In fact, I recommend it even if you're not because it's such a beautiful film that must be seen.  A must-see.erman series.<br />Probably the only quarrel I have with it is the music score by Andrew Powell (one of the members of the Alan Parsons Project).

0393039765|5.0|If you have never seen the movie I highly recommend reading the book first. Both are great but I think I would have appreciated the novel a bit more without having the characters from the movie in my mind.  I am a huge fan and would say that this is his best work behind lullaby, which is my personnal favorite.
B00005JMJ4|1.0|I have seen this type of film over and over--better ones--by unknown independent filmmakers and they have all been ignored. Sofia Coppola's Lost in Translation is noticed because of her name. Any unknown filmmaker makes this kind of film and it would go straight to the forgotten file.<br />Please do not fall for the idiots that interpret this movie as profound. There is nothing extraordinary about this film. Some of the scenes seemed like they were there so that the film would reach a feature length--otherwise this would have really been a short film (it would have been good as a short film). It is getting recognition because Sofia is Francis Ford Coppola's daughter and Hollywood wants to make it a Hollywood story: the daughter of a onced great director is now a great director. What a Hollwood story it is! So let's nominate her and put her on the pedestal. <br />Lost in Translation is a short film that Sofia Coppola extended to a very boring feature. Anything she makes now will be a masterpiece even when it's not. Only people with real sense will see that this film is garbage.
B00005JMFQ|5.0|this is quite possibly my favorite romantic comedy ever.  this movie starts off with a bang and continues that way throughout the entire movie!  it focuses on multiple people and never loses its edge throughout the entire romp.  instead of losing us in the multiple characters, they are all rich and developed to their fullest.  <br />hugh grant plays a loveable (as always) english prime minister who finds himself pining over one of his assistants.  colin firth plays the best role i have ever seen him in!  he is absolutely great in this movie.  he plays a writer who has just lost his love.  into his life steps a housekeeper who can't even speak his language.  the on-screen chemistry between these two is outstanding as they show how love crosses even language barriers.<br />liam neeson's character is my personal favorite in this movie.  he plays a character whose wife has just died.  he is left alone with his step-son as they try to cope with this loss.  liam and his counterpart (wonderfully played by thomas sangster) move throughout this movie with a grace and charm that is hard to find in modern movie cinema.  liam tries to teach sam about love and winning a girl.  some of their parts actually brought tears to my eyes (which rarely happens).  they teach how a step-son and step-father can love each other and help each other through the hardships of life.<br />other great turns in this movie include emma thompson as a wife starving for the love of her husband, sienna guillory as the housekeeper to colin's writer, bill nighy as an aged rockstar trying to make a comeback, and keira knightly as a recently married young woman.<br />if this movie doesn't cause you to feel something, then i would have to believe that you are dead inside.  if you are looking for a wonderful look at how love actually exists, look no further!!!
B000063COX|4.0|This is  a Great debut from one of the Best Metal Acts in the World, It's simply Fun, Energetic, and sometimes Punkiest, i really enjoy the RUNNING FREE ' version here more than the Live after death one(in wich nicko always plays it in a very sloopy way), this was a Different IRON MAIDEN back then , and yes' Dirtier , and Tight sound try KILLERS  wich in my opinion is a better album than this one with better direction, that's why i gave this album 4 stars -
B0000640S2|1.0|Oh man, I bought the 1st one which is really a good movie with a real scenario.<BR>Moreover, Stallone does not talk too much and there is a real script but here!!!!<BR>The dialogues are so bad, the acting is so ridiculous that I did not know if I would cry or laugh when I saw the movie.<BR>This flick is the worse stuff I have seen since the Chuck Norris serie...<BR>Do not buy it, you would really waste money and if you like Stallone, buy Rocky 1 and 2 instead.
B00005JLXE|2.0|I had high hoped for this movie, because i am a casual dare-devil fan/ guess what, i hated pretty much every minute of it. the acting was awefull, they chose the worst villians to put in, and elektra shouldnt have been there at all (its not called daredevil and freinds!)! the CG's were OK, but the action was kind of lame. i'd MUCH rather be watching a '60's low budget kung fu movie than this.
B00005JMJ4|5.0|Bob Harris (Bill Murray) is a faded American action-movie hero visiting Tokyo -- courtesy of a $2 million dollar check -- to film commercials for Suntori liquors.  Spending a week camped out in a luxury hotel he soon meets 25 year-old, American Charlotte (played beautifully by Scarlett Johansson).  Her photog husband is off gallivanting around the country on various shoots.  These two lonely Americans, often unable to sleep or shake off the very 'foreigness' of Japan, soon find interesting company in each other.  She is bright, a Yale philosophy graduate, who is struggling with her role in life.  He is -- at heart -- a washed-up actor, uncomfortable in his long-standing marriage.  Together they encounter more of Japan than either would have alone.<br />The mysterious ending is wonderful... and open to many interpretations.  Coppola has done a masterful job both telling a story and weaving beautiful cinematography into a cohesive whole.  Photographed languidly, at a pace that captures a week of both characters' lives, you will revisit the story repeatedly in your mind.  And that's the mark of an exceptional screenplay.
B00005JM1F|1.0|Why a couple of very talented people like Luke Wilson and Vince Vaughn would get involved in something like this is beyond me. This movie never gets up to speed, the situations are trite and cliche, and with the exception of Luke Wilson's character, who actually has some depth (and then he does something completely out of character and it ruins any sense of credibility that he has developed), there isn't a role in this movie that is at all believable, and more importantly, there is very little that is funny.  It isn't Animal House, it isn't American Pie.....it's just a whole lot of one-liners and 15 second sophmoric humor stretched to 3-5 minutes per gag. It's a good thing Will Ferrel made &quot;Elf&quot;, becuase if this was the best he could do, he should have stayed on SNL.
6303674984|4.0|This is an awesome movie, and a real epic. While true that up close it is not very bloody and people stay intact, it still gets across well the scale of the battle. While being impressed by the bravery of Picket's Charge it still seems stupid and forlorn, and maybe it wasn't so clear cut on the day to those taking part. Even so I thought Martin Sheen was convincing as Lee, while Tom Berenger as Longstreet and Richard Jordan as Armistead were excellent. My only quibbles for me were the unconvincing Oirish sergeant and the sniffy British observer. The unpaid extras were great and must have had a wonderful time.
B0000CEB4V|5.0|This is the best tribute concert I have ever heard and that includes the one for John Lennon.  Thanks to all the perfomers it is a moving and exciting concert.  Too bad that its reason for being is George Harrison's death.  It was erie to see Dhani, Harrison's son, looking like a young George.  I loved Ravi Shankar's loving tribute and how fitting it was.<br /><br />This was a bargain!  I could watch it again and again and have seen it many times already.
B000084T18|1.0|I have no respect for this type of rap music. There is no message, no flow, nothing. It's 100% image. You could kick a typewriter down a staircase and come up with better rhymes than this fool.
B00011RPB0|2.0|This movie tries desperately to express the struggle two people undergo to find  meaning in their lives.  Unfortunately, the expression of the whole concept of what it means to be human is overdone and tedious, and the main characters are unsuccessful in appearing complex and multi-dimensional in their journey.  Instead, they seem spoiled, ungrateful, and just plain bored.  All the scenes showing the main characters looking out of windows or looking into their drinks become annoying when you see them for the 99th time.  I understand what this movie was trying to express, but it failed miserably and instead comes across as an immature and underdeveloped low-budget film that happens to have a big star in it and an association with another famous director.  The Coppola reputation and Bill Murray's talented performance can't salvage it, unfortunately.
B00005JMJ4|1.0|This is to the arrogant reviewer who titled his review, &quot;Measure of Intelligence&quot;. <br />First of all I read a lot of philosophy: Nietzsche's Thus Spake Zarathustra, Sartre's Being and Nothingness, Camus' The Myth of Sisyphus, etc. I have seen all of Ingmar Bergman's film--The Seventh Seal is my all-time favorite. And I understand the emptiness of existence and have examined it myself: &quot;Nothingness lies coiled in the heart of being--like a worm.&quot; (Sartre) I love the cinema and I have seen a lot of cinema--from foreign art to exploitation because I do not discriminate.<br />But enough of this we must praise this film because it is about loneliness and the moments of life that we take for granted. There were a lot of independent films like this released and have all been ignored. If this film is so meaningful, what about the other meaningful films released in 2003 that were ignored? What about independent films like Sylvia, In the Cut, or Dummy? Why choose Lost in Translation? The answer is Sofia Coppola. It is obvious that we are being conditioned by the entertainment media/critics. The hypo-critics are telling us to love this film because it will create a great story: Sofia is not only a female director but is also the daughter of a great director, and now she will become a great director. <br />Wake up folks! This is an average film. There is nothing great in the writing and the directing of this opus. And I cannot believe it is being nominated for best original screenplay. Sofia even admitted that she had to add unnecessary scenes that were not in the script in order to make it longer because her script was too short. <br />Only the herd mentality who likes to think they are smart will fall for this hoax. They are conditioning us to love this film. Please do not fall for it. Think for yourself and be honest with your opinion that this is only an average film.
1869504917|4.0|With something approaching 100,000 copies in print this is one of the all time best-selling NZ books.  Probably the publisher didn't expect it to be the sales success it has been otherwise more money would have been spent on it.  The pictures are all there but they are are small.  A bigger page format would have done them and the beatiful scenery justice.  It's nice to know where the scenes were filmed, but don't expect to recognise the settings in the film instantly as there was a heap of digital manipulation done and a standard requirement of their getting permission to use the locations was that everything look the same after they had finished.  I haven't been on one of the guided tours but I think that would be the best way to go, rather than use this book as a self guide.
B00008H2LB|2.0|Linkin Park. How can I describe these guys? I'll do my best here ....<br />&quot;Whiney, corporate-created Top 40 pop-rock.&quot; <br />That about does it. Linkin Park is talentless. The only band member with some promise is Bennington. He actually has a decent voice. The rest of them blow. Simple power chords, simple drumming, simple bass, et cetera. Indescribably simple songwriting. I mean how many songs can a band write that goes Verse, Chorus, Verse, Chorus, Break, Chorus. Christ man. Learn to write something else. And for the love of God, please stop whining about how bad your relationships are, how no one loves you, how you can't go on, and so on. <br />And to whoever is classifying this band as metal, please, educate yourself a little more thoroughly.<br />By the way, the only reason this thing got 2 stars (and that's stretching it) is because of &quot;Lying From You.&quot; I can actually tolerate that song.
0679759328|4.0|Once again, I finished a Brookner novel wondering if I have read science fiction or maybe the Brits are from another planet.  I always have a strong urge to find some one to discuss a Brookner novel with because it they are generally maddeningly absurd in the portrayal of characters.  The writing and scenery are fine.  I believe that the author attempts to remind us of our own foolish feelings:   Remember how it feels to \\"love\\" someone foolishly the way Edith \\"loved\\" David? (Do you know why you did you did it, or why you are doing it?)  Is freedom better than love or mining for a rich husband even though you might have to pay for it by continuing with a empty \\"love\\" non-relationship with a David?  Brookner does paint in vexing terms these asinine relationships that we have been involved in.  The parent/child relationship is there. Master/slave is always lurking in the name of love.  Things are not what they seem because this is a satire.  You are  reminded of your self if you are a woman. But please, Anita, give us a break.  There are happy relationships out here.  Try to write about one now and then.
B0000CAXIC|5.0|This album speaks to all generations and may be one of the finest works Dave Grohl has done since Nirvana!  I can't imagine any band having more talent with Dave Grohl as the lead singer.  If you don't own it yet, buy it!!
B00006879E|5.0|I first heard of Maroon 5 while at breakfast one day. The TV's in the cafeteria were playing their daily reel of bad pop and rock songs on the college station, CTN. Suddenly, I hear this song, HARDER TO BREATHE, that is unlike anything I've ever heard before! It was such an amazing song that I rushed to my room to try and find out more about this new band. After listening to some more of their songs, I immediately bought a copy of &quot;Songs About Jane&quot;. The music is excellent. The beats are great, and really capture the feelings. From interviews with the band that I've read, though, the title is a little misleading, as not ALL of the songs are about Jane (a psuedonym for Adam's ex-girlfriend). I played the CD for my best friend, and he has declared that &quot;She Will Be Loved&quot; is the song that he and his fiance will be dancing to at their wedding. I highly reccomend Maroon 5. They're a great band with a lot of energy who give really great performances. Also, be sure to check out &quot;The Fourth World&quot;, which was their album when they used to be called KARA'S FLOWERS.
B0001BKAEY|5.0|I am among the group of those who simultaneously both loved Revolutions and hated it. Giving my reasons bluntly would be a huge spoiler for the film itself, so I can't do it, except for to say that this is the only - and I mean the only - film that has ever had me curled up into a ball and sobbing like a child.<br />Seriously. I cried until I had a mild asthma attack, first time I saw this. I had tried not to cry all through the particular scene that tears me up, but I just couldn't do it. Someone in the row behind me laughed and I almost KOd him. The first seven times I've seen this, uncontrollable weeping.<br />But having said that, I do love the film. It's got so many undertones, and despite what I read in an earlier review, it isn't to show that there's 'one truth', but many. I'm an atheist, but the Matrix trilogy does something to me that's impossible to explain without religious terminology. And I'm in love with Trinity. I write fanfiction...

It also has 4 real decent bonus tracks with the Albert's Shuffle remix being absolutely PHAT.  You will love this disc and be totally inspired by it.  Buy it!

0385510438|3.0|In his latest novel, John Grisham has returned to the small town of Clanton, Mississippi, the scene of his first book A TIME TO KILL. Once again he has proven that he has the knack of drawing you into the book, compelling you to read more. I found that this was both good and bad in the case of THE LAST JUROR, good because I always had the sense that something was about to happen and I was desperate to find out what it was. Bad because, more often than not, I was left hanging.<br />Covering the years 1970 to 1979, it's written in the first person from the point of view of Willie Traynor, a young outsider to the town who has just purchased the town newspaper. It's through his eyes that all the events in Clanton are reported.<br />The big story of the day was the rape and murder of a young local woman who was able to identify her attacker as Danny Padgitt to her next-door neighbour. Much is made of the powerful and infinitely corrupt Padgitt family. We hear how dangerous they are when they're crossed, how ruthless they are when dealing with invaders to their land. They are an ever-present, menacing storm cloud lurking on the horizon of the peaceful town of Clanton. Traynor, as an outspoken mouthpiece against Danny Padgitt looks to have put himself firmly within the Padgitt's sights, as have the potential jurors for the trial.<br />Callie Ruffin is the last juror chosen for the Danny Padgitt trial. She is a notable selection because she is the first black juror chosen in Ford County and she is a god-fearing mother of eight adult children and a friend of Willie Traynor. She is a fascinating character and her past is drawn out over a series of extravagant home cooked lunchtime meals that she prepared for Willie.<br />As it turns out, the trial of Danny Padgitt is over one-third of the way into the book. From that point on it really reads like a study of life in a southern small town during the 1970's. Consequently the pace of the book settles down to match the comfortablelifestyle that comes with living in a small town. While this is fine and pleasant enough, it all became a bit frustrating after being revved up by the frenetic activity in the opening and the continual references of retribution that could possibly come from the Padgitt family.<br />Admittedly, we do see some action later in the book, but these sequences too are punctuated by long pauses of inactivity. So much so that rather than building up tension and suspense, I found that it had the opposite effect and it was more a sense of relief that something was happening that I felt. <br />I suppose the most damning observation I could make is the realisation that the anecdotes told to Willie about the misdeeds of the Padgitt family sounded a lot more interesting than the actual events of the book. The story of sheriff's deputies going missing on Padgitt land appeals to me a lot more than the manoeuvrings of minor politicians in an election race.<br />It also seems that Grisham's chronic ending problem is continuing. I've been disappointed in the way Grisham has ended his books in the past (notably in THE FIRM, THE CLIENT and THE SUMMONS), often leaving the whole story unfinished at the final full stop. I felt that he did it again here. After meandering through town learning about every religious belief in the county, renovating Willie's house in record slowness and drawing out the discussion of whether or not to sell the newspaper, we were suddenly nearing the 350-page that appears to be Grisham's limit. Before I knew it, everything was wrapped up in a clumsy package and the book was finished. Long and carefully constructed plotlines were cut without a by your leave and characters who had become very familiar were abandoned.<br />As mentioned at the start of the review, Clanton Mississippi was the setting of Grisham's first book, A TIME TO KILL and as such, we are reacquainted with a few of the characters from that book. Making his reappearance is Harry Rex Vonner, lawyerand source of all sorts of useful local knowledge for Traynor. Also, there's the deliciously unscrupulous defence attorney, Lucien Wilbanks, one of the better &quot;man you love to hate&quot; characters I've come across. Smaller appearances are made by D.A. Rufus Buckley and Judge Omar Noose who both have much larger roles in Grisham's earlier book.<br />All is not lost with THE LAST JUROR. Read it for the pleasant imagery of rural living in Mississippi. Relax on Callie Ruffin's front porch over a delicious home-cooked meal. Delight in the increasingly profitable newspaper business built by Willie Traynor. But don't go looking for a tension-charged mystery.
B0000DJZA5|5.0|LET IT BE...NAKED did not disappoint.  Ringo Starr states in an interview that THE LONG AND WINDING ROAD sounds incredible, but the title track, LET IT BE is unbelievably crisp and soulful using the take used in the film (one can tell by George Harrison's solo guitar work). The rest of the album is just a pleasure to listen to.  Another chapter of greatness by the fab four and a &quot;must-get&quot; album for Beatlesmaniacs and non-Beatlemaniacs alike.

B000031XCR|1.0|this is poop. and stinky poop at that.
B00009ATKS|5.0|Having previously heard Young Team, an album that I considered a mixed success, I was hoping to find that the band had learned from their successes and failures and come up with a more refined effort.  I am very pleased to say that I think they did.  I can hear both the explosive elements of Young Team as well as a new element...much better mixing and a much richer atmosphere that at times can remind me slightly of Sigur Rós.  Perhaps it's the string arrangements that most contribute to this impression; I think they are a wonderful addition to the Mogwai sound.  The painfully short tracks &quot;Moses? I Amn't&quot; and &quot;Golden Porsche&quot; best exemplify this new element.<br />The only disappointments I found are in &quot;Moses? I Amn't&quot; and &quot;Boring Machine Disturbs Sleep&quot;.  In the first song, while it was nearly perfect, I admit I was disappointed by the amount of analogue hiss I could hear in the percussion.  It was such a haunting sound they used--I just wish it hadn't had such a major flaw in it.  The other thing that disappointed me was the fact that &quot;Boring Machine Disturbs Sleep&quot; was in fact a bit boring in comparison to the other songs this album had to offer.  I've never been impressed with the lead vocalist's unaltered voice, so I consider this track the only true weak point of the album.<br />But, not enough can possibly be said about the other tracks!  &quot;Killing All the Flies&quot; starts out soft, but has a surprising explosion into a refined version of a Young Team-like rock that really makes listening worth it.  &quot;Ratts of the Capital&quot; has a similar effect, but is even better...even as the longest track of the album, it just isn't long *enough*.  Perhaps the album's most *haunting* track, though, is &quot;I Know You Are But What Am I&quot;.  The piano part in particular is quite haunting and minimalist--but without becoming annoying and monotonous as I sometimes heard on Young Team.  The percussion loop isalso mesmerising, and that strange, almost Game Boy-like synth gives it the feeling of a cold winter's night under the moon.  I also noticed there's something very unusual going on with the time signature--some strange aspect to the rhythm that I can't quite catch hold of, and don't have the expertise to describe.  Whatever it is, it's quite intriguing, to say the least, and a very neat sign of the subtle inventiveness Mogwai has learned.<br />As if the music weren't enough, I mus truly commend the initiative of Mogwai and the generosity of Steinberg--as an amateur sound production enthusiast, imagine my surprise and delight when a white slip of paper fell out of the liner notes saying the album had come with a free demo of Cubase SX, no less, and tracks provided by Mogwai of &quot;Hunted Like a Freak&quot;.  Imagine my further delight when I discovered the demo has no expieration date and is *nearly* fully functional.  I am not an expert, and I don't pretend to understand even half of Cubase's full power--but what I *have* managed to figure out, I'm impressed with.  I've truly enjoyed playing with the possibilities.  Again, I extend my thanks to Mogwai and Steinberg for this remarkable opportunity as well as for an overall great album.
B00018HU4U|4.0|I don't understand the people who are bored with her new album (or first for that matter). It is a refreshing change from the one size fits all &quot;rap-crap&quot; or &quot;diva-dung&quot; that most folks are listening to now days. You who find it unappealing can keep your Snoop Dog or Bratenie Spears . . . give me something where the words mean something and you can understand them. Give me a Norah Jones ballad anytime. Why do you think she won the Grammys last year? Like Come Away With Me, this one will just get better and better each time you listen to it. It has spent more time in the CD player in my car than in its case.<br />This is the best Valentines gift my wife has ever given me!
0062502182|5.0|I was pleasantly surprised by what I found in this book. Despite the appearance of a simple fable-like story the depth of wisdom contained in this book is both deeply profound and inspiring. In the 10th Anniversary Edition the author discusses the idea that as children growing up we are constantly told that our dreams are silly and unattainable, so as we get older we move further and further away from our dreams until we can't even remember what it was that we wanted most, how sad.  This one is a story that can be read over and over,it peels like an onion, with so<BR>many layers.  I've recommended this book to all my friends, and I hope those of you reading this will pick up this gem and enjoy it as well.
0440237688|5.0|This is a wonderful book for all ages. THE GIVER provides a startling example of the importance of shared experiences and the impossibilty of utopian societies. The concept of opposites not existing without the other is also explored in THE GIVER, when pain cannot be eradicated without also eradicating pleasure. Lois Lowry has created a beautifully written book that you will think about for days after reading it.
0385510438|5.0|The Last Juror is a wonderful story about the decade between the late '60's and late '70's, tangentially covering social and political issues from Vietnam, Civil Rights, and the youth movement.  The characters are real people you will care about.  The story is well paced and grabbing.  If anyone has been harboring doubts about the status of Grisham in the Pantheon of great American writers this novel will easily dispel them.  This is a rich Southern Novel that will stand beside all others.
B00000JGHS|4.0|Although some of the casting in this movie is a bit cheesy, the story line isn't too bad. Some of my favorite actors are here, like demi moore for starters, the t T-1000(a.k.a. robert patrick)and even smokie and the bandits burt reynolds! The story revolves around a stripper who ends up in a custody battle over her daughter. If you've ever wanted to see demi moore as close to au natural as possible then this movie in my opinion comes as close as were probably gonna get! But i'll leave something to the imagination! Just watch the movie and judge it for yourself!

6304884419|5.0|Every time i watch this movie i wish i was back in that time in a doo-wap group or whatever they call those things. I believe its one of the first things you'll see when the movie starts. This movie i believe has a lot of harmony in it, you just have to be able to find it. I thought the soundtrack was killer! Of all the acting i've seen from chaz palminteri and robert deniro, these have to be two of the best performances i've ever seen! So if you can get past the profanity and the racism,i think you'll find this movie a 10 just like i did!
B0000C1733|5.0|well as excelent as this cd is, some songs could have been better chosen. Universally speaking could have been switched with cant stop or preferably aeroplane.  another thing. why not throw right on time in there.  i mean, its only 1:56 seconds, and nothing wouold have to be removed.  still a must buy cd though.  Save the Population is a great songs that getts better every time you listen to it.  Fortune fadded is also great but you should get single #1 which has eskimo on it.
B00005JLYW|3.0|Fans of the modern theatrical incarnation of the hit 70s T&A-a-rama shouldn't be too disappointed with the second cinematic outing staring three of the hottest ladies in film today. It's a thrill ride of bombastic, baroque proportions where every action sequence blows off the screen like a James Bond flick on steroids. There's something to be said of the steam-generating hotness of Cameron Diaz, Drew Barrymore and Lucy Lui, but all the butt-kickin' action, cleverly orchestrated comedic scripting and eye-popping, scantily-clad flesh isn't enough to make it memorable. After the ride, it's quickly forgotten. Still, it's one of those movies one likes in the collection to pull out once a year for surely escapist purposes.<br />If you're looking for mindless fun with a generous payoff in humorous and sexy antics pureed with flashy unrealistic action sequences, fun cameos and over-the-top acting that doesn't take itself too seriously, give the dvd a whirl. Don't bother searching high & low or paying extra for the \\"Unrated\\" version; the changes are barely noticeable. Further, while the slick, shadowy and suggestive cover art entices the prurient mind and the wandering eye, there is no extra skin in this flick, just a few drawn out action scenes and a little blood.
B00005JM0B|2.0|Folks, this just isn't a very good movie.  It's little more than a remake, of sorts, of Terminator 2.  <br />Gone is any mystery and menace associated with Arnold's Terminator character.  Political correctness has turned him into a &quot;nice guy&quot; who avoids killing people at all costs (an ideological carryover from the second movie).  Lokken's female Terminator character is a rehash of the Terminator played, more effectively, by Robert Patrick in T2.  While she is a little more advanced, technologically-speaking, than T2, it takes the form of bang-and-boom weaponry than anything that really adds to the story.<br />The scene in the cemetary was totally unnecessary.  I mean, c'mon, that's the only place that weapons could be hidden?!?  Half that stuff you can buy on the street--or better still, do what Arnold did in the first movie and just walk into a store and steal it.  I would also add that the reintroduction of the character actor (don't know his name) who played the psychiatrist in the first two movies just doesn't work.  I'm sure the makers thought it would draw big laughs, but it only drew a couple of snickers in the audience that I was among.<br />While the introduction scene for Arnold--in a strip club--is amusing, it, too, has become a tired imitation from the original.  <br />Of course, you have the highway chase and destroy scene.  Visually it is an eyeful, but even it is rather mundane since it is so over the top.  Other special effects are outstanding, as you would expect.  But they should have spent more on a better story, instead.<br />The John Connor character acts more like a whining momma's boy than a savior of the world, and his new girlfriend doesn't add much to his persona.  <br />Obviously, this movie is simply setting the stage for yet another sequel and, hopefully, an actual resolution to the story.  Let's hope they actually do it right next time.  I also wouldn't mind seeing Kyle Reece, played by Michael Biehn in the original, reintroduced for the final chapter.
B0001AP12G|4.0|from his mind, his heart , he tells whats important in his life. His career his family and his values . Also mentioning his shortcomings and faults--- great album --amazing hooks too
B00005OM4N|4.0|&quot;Britney&quot; was the first album from Britney Spears that I could listen the whole way through without skipping anything.  She grew up and matured her material this time around instead of singing bubblegum stuff from her first two.  Before I begin however, I do admit that Britney's voice has degraded since her first two albums, which is a shame, because it's evident here on a few of the tracks.  But that being said, she still deserves some due credit for this rather surprising album:<br />1.  I'm a Slave 4 U -- The first single.  Some love it, some hate it.  It's all a matter of taste, really... if you like the urban, funky beats you'll love this track.  I happened to hate it at first, but it grows on you after awhile.  <br />2.  Overprotected -- Second single.  Great track!  Catchy in its lyrics and sucked me in from the very beginning.  Great message, shows a side of Britney we didn't see earlier.<br />3.  Lonely -- I love, love, LOVE this track.  This is such a powerful song with a message that boasts killer beats and drums.  It kind of reminds me of &quot;Can't Hold Us Down&quot; from Christina Aguilera in terms of supporting female empowerment.  <br />4.  I'm Not a Girl, Not Yet a Woman -- Another single.  I thought it was a bit icky at first, since this was the first ballad and it's VERY evident how much poor vocal degrading Britney has gone through since her debut.  Nonetheless though, it's a pretty ballad with a meaningful message.<br />5.  Boys -- Another single.  Great song with a catchy beat, but the remix with Pharell Williams was better.  If you can get a copy of the remix, I'd recommend that.  Listening to the remix compared to this one makes this one sound rather bland.<br />6.  Anticipating -- Sounds like a song Janet Jackson would do.  Very fast-paced and energetic.  Not as good as the others in terms of lyrical content, but still pretty good.<br />7.  I Love Rock 'n' Roll -- Okay, some people REALLY despise this because it's a cover of a classic, but honestly, it isn't that bad.  Of course the original is better, but Britney doesn't massacre it like she did with the Rolling Stones from &quot;Oops!... I Did it Again.&quot;<br />8.  Cinderella -- This is a harsh, gritty song where Britney sounds rather agravated through the whole thing.  Great tune as Britney renounces being a &quot;Cinderella&quot; for everyone.<br />9.  Let Me Be -- Hmm.  The lyrical content is pretty good, but I don't like the beats or the tune.  Probably my least favorite on the entire disc.<br />10.  Bombastic Love -- If there's one song that should have been a single that wasn't, this is it.  Great beats, great melody, and Britney does great with it.  It was also very catchy as well, as I found myself humming it a lot.<br />11.  That's Where You Take Me -- Sounds rather mediocre at first, but after a few listens, it's actually a nice track.  Give it a few listens and it grows on you.<br />12.  What It's Like to Be Me -- I don't really know what I think about this one.  It's not one of my favorites, and I think she could've closed the disc with a better track, but nonetheless, it leaves a good message to ponder.  <br />So there you go.  Britney's third album, IMO, is a pretty good one, and I recommend her fourth in addition to this.  Skip the first two, unless you are dying to have the singles and are compelled to buy the albums rather than buy the singles online.  Britney's growing up and is maturing in her material, and it is evident on this disc.  It is shocking how different she is in terms of sound and material from her second album to this one.  She experiences with different beats, sounds, melodies, and lyrical content, and I think she succeeded pretty well.
B00004Z400|3.0|I'm into lots of styles of music, rock, punk, alt-metal, but I can't get into this album. I don't dislike it, I've just never really gotten excited about it, even after a few years. At the times when I think I could like it, I realize I'd just rather listen to something else. I don't think I like the way this guy sings/screams. I think they remind me too much of &quot;Staind&quot;, who's better, and I don't even really like them. I do like the songs &quot;Change (in the house of flies)&quot;, and &quot;Passenger&quot; though. I know some people probably worship this disc, but I'd rather listen to &quot;Tool&quot;, &quot;Korn&quot;, &quot;Rage&quot;, etc.
B0000CFW87|3.0|Josh Groban is a refreshing young voice in a time of talentless commercialized hype. He is professional and polished, and it will be interesting to observe his progress in the years to come. Those who are interested in pursuing music &quot;a cut above&quot; the norm will do well to hear his latest offering. However, in reviewing recent comments, I must concur 100% with the guidance of those who have referenced the work of Dmitri Hvorostovsky. A well trained ear will recognize that voice as a gift of God...truly divine and rare. There is no singer alive who compares. If you are now beginning to develope a taste for music along more classical lines...Josh Groban is a good point to diverge from the tedium of pop culture. But do give yourself the opportunity to hear Hvorostovsky; you won't regret it and his voice will open you to a whole new world of understanding and appreciation!
B00018D44U|1.0|...to &quot;Feels Like Home&quot;<BR>Im very dissapointed I thought she would stick to her sound like in her debut album which was an ok album this album seems very countryish and I realy dont like it!<br />I advise you if you like &quot;Come Away With Me&quot; and is exspecting this album to be like that then dont get it its just 100 more times boring and has realy bad tunes!
B000084T18|5.0|I can't see how anyone would say this albumis garbage, or that em or dre didn't do a good job. I think this ranks right up there with the classics ( Ready to Die, Illmatic.) I would say that 17 out of the 18 songs on the album could be hits. The beats and lyrics on this album are almost unrivaled, in the last couple years, besides maybe Jay-Z's Black Album. This is a great album, 10 years from now people will still be buying this classic. I can't wait for the next album.
B00018D44U|1.0|This is the most horrible Album of 2004 and I can't belive I bought it!<BR> I wanted too see what all the fuss was albout this album so I got it and Im so upset I lost my money's worth.<BR> The songs are bad,the toons are awful,and Norah's voice is very tiring.<BR>And also there is Spyware on this CD which means if you place this disc in your computer it will mess it up grrrrrrrrr Im so mad so I thought I should give peeps second thoughts before getting such an album!
B0000DD7LB|1.0|At first I followed Britney. Then she took her break and I took mine. When I heard this ablum, I realized, this girl can't really sing. I mean, she has talent, but she really can't sing. I have never really heard her sing from deep down. Her tunes are catchy, but that's it. No meaning, no feeling. The only reason she is a pop princess is for her looks. Her voice is less than mediocre. At least Jessica Simpson and Xtina can sing. Give it a try Britney! You might just become a singer! You let me down :-(
B0001AP12G|5.0|Yo, I just gotta tell everyone that this album is tight.  Not to put the album down or anything, but it's not for everyone, I'm sure there will be some haters out there, but it's all good.  It's something different, you know?  He raps about some serious social issues as well as some of the usual hip hop rhymes about money, girls, etc.  My favorite tracks are Get 'Em High, We Don't Dare, and All Falls Down.  If you're into the soft stuff, Family Business and Last Call are tight too.  Family Business is tight because I can relate to a lot of the stuff he raps about.
B00009TB5G|1.0|Come on guys this is a boring pointless movie. I have never met any one who didnt like it. Most of the movie is talking. The hobbits look like freaks. I think the author had serios problems with his brain. Its like the movie makes everyone like it even though its one of the worst movies ever. The plot is crazy its all about a stupid ring. I know everyone is going to say its a bad reveiw but its my opinian andplease realize that LORD OF THE RINGS IS A STUPID POINTLESS UNREALISTIC MOVIE MADE BY A RETARD.
B0001ENY6M|5.0|I loved this music because it was so evocative of the movie, and the book the movie is based on, THE AUTOBIOGRAPHY OF JESUS CHRIST .
B0001AP12G|4.0|Yo Kanye West got some skills being that he's not only a producer but a rapper, a crazy combination.  Though the album is crazy there were still some things that I didn't like.  As album art goes the thing that was kinda of hard was to tell wut song you're listenin to, but u get over that very quickly.  The major thing is that though it lists 21 tracks, there are really 14 with 7 skits.  SOme of the skits like School Spirit 1 and 2 are very humoress but very correct, they're are just some that are completely not needed.  Other than that I have no problems.<BR>    Beside those defects, tha album got some &quot;soul&quot; to it which is much different from any other album out now.  MY favortie tracks are &quot;All Falls Down&quot; featuring Syleena Johnson, &quot;Spaceship&quot;, &quot;Jesus Walks&quot; which gotta be tha best song on this cd, &quot;Get em High&quot; featuring Talib Kweli nd Common(COmmon spits some ill rhymes),&quot;WorkOut PLan&quot;, and &quot;Two Words&quot; featuring MOs Def and Freeeway.  Though I like &quot;Last Call&quot; the thing I like da most about it is that towards tha end of the song Kanye informs u about wut he did do get to where hes at.  He tells the whole story.  Another thing I would like to bring up is that when I first heard of KAnye, all I could think of was his big headed attitude but through the lyrics in this song &quot;Last year shopping my demo I was tryin to shine/ Every motherf@**%# told me that I couldn't rhyme/Now I could let these dreawm killers kill my self esteem/ Or use my arrogance as the steam to power my dreams/ I use it as my gas so they say that I'm gassed/ BUt without it I'd be last so I ought to laugh&quot; I understand why he is the way he is. ANd if you cop the album, you'll see he has all the right to be arrogant.  Though reading this review you find that K. West got some skills but to me there is something lackin from his ability to rhyme than from is ability to produce.  He's produced hot tracks for manyartists and in my opinion he is a better producer.  BUt when he drops a sophmore album I'll be first to cop it. 1
B000001EC1|5.0|I love  cross  road.   . but  cross  road   does  not  have   all   of   bon  jovi   hits. I  heard   that   bon  jovi   is  going   to  put  out    a  box   set   of   their   greatest    hits  later   this   year.    can  some  one  tell   me   if   this   is   true ?
B0000057C5|5.0|This album is definitely fighting for the title of Rammstein's best album, and is definitely up there for the top industrial rock album of all times.<br />First, let me explain what the term Industrial Rock means:<BR>Industrial rock is basically heavy metal/hard rock, combined with elements from both techno and pop.  When done right, as in this case, it creates not a cheezy, poppy effct, but an incredibly heavy rock song.  Industrial rock is NOT Korn.  Korn sucks.  Industrial rock is Marilyn Manson, Rob/White Zombie, some Nine Inch Nails songs, Hanzel und Gretyl, some KMFDM, especially their latest, WWIII.  And most of all, Industrial Rock is NOT David Bowie.  (While that is occasionally good music) It's not even rock.<br />1) Sehnsucht (Longing)--the title track of this album is incredible.  The vocals are great, the guitars are sharp, and the beat is fas and hard.  A quintessential Industrial Rock song.  The lyrics are about a guy who screws a girl while she's asleep. <br />2)Engel (Angel)--This song is good too, with a slower, hippier beat that makes the video's setting (a strip club) easy to believe.  It also features a background singer, a woman named Bobo, who plays the voice of the angel, which is a nice contrast to Till Lindemann's harsh growl.  Also notable about this track is that the instrumental version was combined with a rap song by Eminem called \\"Slim Shady,\\" which was very cool.  This song is about going to hell.<br />3) Tier (Animal)--This is an awesome song.  It starts out with a trippy line on the accoustic guitar, then slams into the full fury of Rammstein.  This song is about a guy who sleeps with his daughter until his wife kills him.<br />4)Bestrafe Mich (Punish Me)--This song is cool as well, with a slightly more poppy sond than some of the other ones.  The song is about someone who wants to be punished, and I think with some religeous allegory.<br />5) Du Hast (You Have)--This song has a total of about ten words (Du -- du has t-- du hast mich.  Repeated a lot of times, and then the chorus).  It has a really cool guitar riff, and an awesome chorus that sounds like opera turned gothic, but there is an annoying techno blip to it.  The song is about renouncing wedding values.<br />6) Buch Dich (Bend Down)--An awesome, really hard song with a slamming beat and guitars, sadistic vocals, and a cool 'solo' ish thing at the end.  It's about homosexual rape.<br />7) Spiel Mit Mir (Play with me)--from the start of this song, it's apparent that it's going to be evil.  It starts out with a low string line, a single note repeated many times, with children laughing barely audible in the background.  Then the guitars kick in, and it's a mid tempo, pounding song, with more operatic vocals and a guitar solo that sounds like something you would hear in a murder scene of a movie.  In fact, they should use the whole song in some horror movie.  The song is about an incestuous relationship between two small children.<br />8) Klavier (Piano)-- this song is pretty good, as far as ballads go.  It's pretty sad, but about halfway through it gets downright suicidal when the guitars start.  It's about a guy who dates a girl who plays her piano in a locked room until her mother and father find out and beat him to death.<br />9)Alter Mann (Old Man)--this is the only REALLY bad song on the CD.  I hate it; it's just a boring, pointless song that seems to go nowhere, with lackluster vocals and not enough tempo.  It's about an old man who dies, basically.<br />10) Eifersucht (Jealousy)- This is a cool song, but not nearly as cool as any of the first seven songs.  It has a low, pounding beat and evil, psychotic sounding vocals.  It's about a guy who's making threats to someone who is jealous of him, telling him to remove whatever he's jealous of.<br />11) Kuss Mich (Kiss Me)--An okay song, but the vocals are too high, and not suited for the sadistic content.  It's about rape, basically.  And about killing someone by beating them to deathwith your tounge.<br />Overall, the album is great, even though it seems to lose much of its intensity after the first eight songs.<br />10/10
B0001KL5DA|5.0|Well, it took long enough.  Thanks HBO or whoever set this up.  Season 1 was outstanding, and I expect nothing less from S2.
B00000272N|5.0|Is there anybody who can sing like Layne Staley?  I don't think there is and this cd prooves it. Not only are the vocals excellent, the songs are all great. The guitars have a nice crunch to them and some cool solos. This cd is well worth the $11 I payed for it, it's one of my favorites. If you like metal/grunge/rock you will love this cd!
B000002J5K|5.0|Take two comedians with an interest in the blues, give them a backup band, a movie, and some creative license, and look at what comes out...<br />The songs go from the campy (Peter Gunn &amp; Rawhide) to the dancable (Shake Your Tail Feathers) to the standard (Sweet Home Chicago &amp; Minnie the Moocher).  With a phenomenal backup band (The old Saturday Night Live orchestra) and some classic guest vocalists (Chaka Khan, James Brown and Ray Charles to name a few) it's a treat for the ears.  Eleven songs pack both a variety and depth of fun music.  <br />The only downside on the album is two missing songs.  Some might expect Soul Man, which was perhaps Belushi &amp; Akroyd's most famous tune.  I personally missed John Lee Hooker's Boom Boom Boom Boom, my favorite song and artist from the movie.<br />That said, the CD is great for those looking for a smiling memory of the movie or a wide pop introduction to the blues.  I'm generally not one to review too many CDs, but this one warrants a good plug!
B00009Z576|4.0|Don't judge it just because Anderson isn't in it, this album shows off some of Squire's best playing and some good 80's Yes. Best thing from Yes to come out of the 80's.
B000002NC4|4.0|Eight tracks. Each track is roughly seven minutes or more long. I don't know what 7 multiplied by 8 is, but I'm sure it equals something along the line of awesome. Honestly, this is one of the better albums I have heard for a while. Each track is full of different parts and changes, ignoring the common verse chorus verse pattern you might hear elsewhere. Plus, no song sounds alike, each offers something different. The lyrics, although somewhat odd, match the sound of the music, which is very full and unique, with chords and guitar parts you are likely not to hear anywhere else. It is very melodic, and very full sounding, although not packed with over dubs and effects pedals. It's mostly just guitar, but it's well done. All in all, a good unique album, definately worth the $15.
B00008CLOA|5.0|WOW!!!!!!!This 30th Anniversary Edition is worth buying even if you got the orignal Pink Floyd CD buy this one. This includes many features that will blow you away yes I do have surround sound and its out of this world. I listened to it in both formats even in STERO which also sounds wonderful so if you got surround sound or dont it does not really matter. This includes a booklet with many rare photographs also many rare covers like their RUSSIAN COVER and other record covers. I listened to the whole CD and it just rocks. This is DIGITALY REMASTERED also their are lyrics to all the songs so you can sing with the record. Please dont miss out on this masterpiece buy it NOW!!!!!
B000002GJ7|5.0|Nuno's ability to wail away on his custom washburn and Gary's amazing vocal range with Pat Badger throwing down a crazy bass line on \\"Get The Funk Out\\" along with Paul Geary keeping the heart of the band is the formula for utter success!!!  You may be buying this album just for \\"More Than Words\\" or \\"Hole Hearted\\" but believe me, put this album on and listen from start to finish and your mind will be blown away.  When I was about 4 or 5 years old, my mom bought \\"Pornographitti.\\"  \\"More Than Words\\" was the song I listened to when I was going to sleep.(The Only Way I Would Go To Sleep)  Anyway, as I got a little older and more into playing guitar, I had to play this whole album to perfection, a near impossible task, just because I was so infatuated with this album.  No song on this album will let you down.  It will truly take you on a journey of the mind and body when you buy this truly wonderful combination of a story behind the music.  Take good care of this album because you will want to hand it down from generation to generation.
0385512104|4.0|I picked this book up in London after having learned that it was bestowed the Whitbred Prize.  I had never heard of it and had no idea that it had been selected by the Today Show as a book club book.  In any event, I felt it was a terrific read.  The main character, an English teenager with Asperger Syndrome, is a totally sympathetic character.  Through a series of episodes, we are quickly able to understand the world in which he, Christopher, is trapped.  I had only a few complaints regarding the thrust of the action.  Christopher loses faith in his father for something his father did.  Granted, his father's actions were deplorable, but, perhaps, understandable, given his father's anger with Christopher's mother.  However, did Christopher write his father's actions off because of the on/off, black/white nature of his syndrome, or because Christopher is a teenager? To not know this answer diminished my experience as a reader.  And in terms of pacing, the first 90 percent of the book took place within a scope of days, the final ten percent in a course of months.  To me, it felt slightly lopsided.  Nonetheless, the wonderful writing style and peak into another world made this an entertaining and worthwhile read.
B00005JKC3|1.0|Ang Lee viewed the story as a Greek Tragedy. The only tragedy here was letting him direct this ponderous, dull, flat meandering film. The multi-frame scenes that are supposed to mimic a comic page only distract. I mean how many frames of helicopters flying endlessly over featureless desert are needed?<BR>The story starts out with a confusing obtuse story about the hero's father doing some sort of proscribed experiment. Unfortunately the rest of the film adds nothing to the plot. The characters are all either flat and stereotypic, or silly caricatures. You never get a chance to develop any sympathy for anyone in the film. <BR>And just so it does not go unmentioned: four star generals DO NOT   <BR>command bases; secret or otherwise.
B00006IUIG|5.0|In 8 1/2 we enter the fragmented world belonging to a filmmaker struggling with the creation of his next film.  Guido Anselmi is the protagonist and is a thinly-veiled projection of (director) Federico Fellini.  Formally, this film has moments of rare beauty.  In terms of content, it is a confessional piece that appears extremely personal while at the same time giving voice to common struggles of man.  Guido is subjected to a maelstrom of questions which he has no answers to.  One can assume these are all questions that he is silently asking himself.  Guido's conversations become quite loaded and reveal an incomplete man beneath the mystique of an artistic reputation.  Guido navigates often hostile environments with only brief possibilities for fulfillment and repose.  Guido cannot find the worldly rewards that he expects for himself and seems as much a victim of his own pessimism as of the endless demands of his colleages and lovers.  Toward the end, the desperation featured in the story might actually reflect the reality of the production of 8 1/2.  I am only guessing, because as obsurd as the film becomes it seems to remain interested in \\"the truth\\" of things.  Questions play a large role in this story as much as do the silences that often follow them.  <br />Fellini has left us with a groundbreaking film that has a lot of heart.  I highly recommend this DVD to anyone willing to watch it.
B00014TJ6Q|5.0|It's such a shame this album is often overlooked.  Most fan/critical buzz is over All Things Must Pass, which is a brilliant set in its own right.  But if you're looking for a relaxed and happy George (newlywed and new father!), you can find him right here.  &quot;Love Comes To Everyone&quot; and &quot;Blow Away&quot; are real gems that are easy on the ears.  This is a cd you can repeat over and over in your car or on your daily walks.
B00000K0DT|4.0|great movie. if u like a good mystery movie this is the one for u it has enough twists and turns to keep u interested to the finale 5 minutes. this is a great mystery movie that is not to be missed
B00005JMFQ|5.0|This is one of the best romantic comedies I've ever watched. I liked that the characters had depth and the fact that even though it was a romance, the romances didn't work for every couple. Kinda like real life. The Laira Linney character and Kiera Knightley's secret (for a while) admirer were 2 of my favorites although Martine McCutcheon was my favorite. I wonder why she hasn't been in more films than she has. Anyway It's a great movie.Watch it and see for yourself.
B000050FEN|4.0|seven is one of those movies that gets under ur skin and is gut wrenching it is clever and it provides a few jumps here and there. there is no way u can leave this movie not feeling at least a little disturbed.this is a great phsychological thriller
038572179X|2.0|this is another strange book by ian mcewan,it features the misinterpretation of a young girl named Briony and her false accusation of the man who raped her cousin.it is cleverly divided into different time periods;1935,1939 and 1999 therefore showing the events leading up to world war 2 and during and after.it includes startling and accurate viewpoints from nurses and soldiers.i think this book is only let down by ian mcewans habit of rambling on and over analysing a situation or feeling. not a bad read but uneventful and slightly dated.
B0000542D2|5.0|If you are a fan of the Beatles, and who isn't, this is the DVD you must have! Besides being one of my favorite movies, the bonus material on the 2nd disc is awesome! THis movie is awesome and hilarious, whether you like the beatles or not! I reccomed this movie to anyone who likes movies as everyone will love it!Buy this DVD now!you wont be dissapointed!
B000024C7W|5.0|I've been looking for and thinking about this record for a long, long time. I'm so glad that it's available here! It is truly a work of art -- with out question Stevie Wonder's best.  You won't find a lot of hits on it, but an incredible combination of world (before the genre even had a name), jazz, classical.  Truly before its time, and nothing has come quite close to it since.   A must have.
B000002C25|4.0|When I thought of writing a review for this album the first word to completely describe this extravaganza of sound and emotion was, &quot;Bombastic!&quot;  The scope of this album is gigantic, their incredible ambition notable on each and every song.  These guys exude such a high level of confidence on each track here that I simply couldn't help but enjoy myself.  Their confidence is that infectious!  There are the familiar nods to The Stone Roses and The Beatles, undeniable influences, but here there are also Led Zeppelin flourishes that make the music sound immense and powerful.  While this CD certainly isn't as tightly produced as &quot;(What's the Story) Morning Glory?,&quot; it is equally ambitious, infrequently overblown, and is certainly worth the paltry sum they are asking for here at Amazon.com.  This is a solid album, and is easy to recommend.  Later.
B0000DD7LB|5.0|This album has got to be the best collection of pop music I've ever heard!  Not one track is bad, in fact they're all amazing and each have something different to offer the listener!  Among the best tracks are Breathe on Me, Toxic, Me Against the Music, Touch of My Hand, &amp; Everytime.  If you want to hear the best pop music has to offer, take my advice and pick this album up immediately!
B00005JMJ4|1.0|As a grad student studying film as social history, I must emphasize that this hapless drivel could well begin the fall of civilization as we know it!  Sophia Coppola takes her audience on a wild and woolly romp through the underbelly of a luxury hotel in Tokyo.  A bunch of Japanese people who want to be American but haven't bothered to learn English are annoying to Murray (who gives the greatest cimeatic performance since Jim Varney in Earnest Goes to Jail)yet he manges to maintain his focus on his pediophilaic lust for a pale, dare I say bleached young wench.  This film makes Sex in the City look like The Autobiography of Mother Theresa.  That is to say, the depths of its philosophic vacuity recall Allen Iverson's famous dictum:  Practice?  We're talkin about practice!  If Iverson manages to capture the ennui of post Y2K melancholy, then Coppola would have done well to bow to Socratic defiance and drank the proverbial hemlock, metaphorically speaking, of course.  I sadly give this film a -5 stars.
0385504209|3.0|Fundamentalists should consider other reading material but you have to give kudos to the author for making theological discussions such a hot topic.  A very interesting premise which involves the Holy Grail, the Knights Templar and the Priory Of Sion. Brown beautifully interweaves fact and fiction concerning these fascinating subjects and prodded me to read related works.  Now onto the problems I had with this novel:  annoying references to previous novel (the Vatican incident); too many of the scenes are just outright unbelieveable and the inclusion of hollywood blockbuster action scenes forces the reader to question whether Brown was counting on a movie deal as he wrote; major reasoning flaws scattered throughout the second half of the novel (to name just one, a mirror image that the most brillant code detecting minds couldn't figure out? come on); and lastly, the totally smarmy ending tempted me to scream.  Overall, an entertaining read.
B00005QGAT|4.0|I just want to alert any potential buyers out there that this CD has tracks containing nothing but TALKING by Quincy Jones, or else first-draft attempts at a song by Michael.  So in other words, if you are like myself, and you like to just throw some CDs into your stereo, and put it on &quot;shuffle&quot; or &quot;scramble&quot; for a party, you'll end up getting some tracks of nothing but talking, or else a draft track that's not quite as good as the final track, found elsewhere on the same CD.
630518299X|5.0|This is one of the greatest movies ever, mostly because of the brilliant script. It is pretty touching, creative, emotional and it really makes you think about how privilegded you are with your own privacy. <BR>Christof tries, or better say he still did, to create a perfect world\\" for Truman. A life, without any real emotions. But the movie shows that a life without any emotions, including sadness, fear or pain, could never exist.<BR>But nevertheless, sometimes I was wondering, how realistic und plausible it seems. You begin to ask yourself what if this all happens to you!?<BR>I think this movie is open to many interpretations, which is what makes it so interesting.
B00011RPB0|1.0|I really wanted to see this film because of all the hype.  In addition, I adore Bill Murray.  I guess I need to just avoid any movie that the critics like (I did love THE ENGLISH PATIENT).  I have actually heard critics say that this movie is better than LORD OF THE RINGS and it should win the academy award.  Hello!!  Watching LOST IN TRANSLATION was sheer torture.  It was so boring--of course this is because nothing happened.  And, it wasn't funny (with the exception of a couple scenes).  In fact, there was no point, message or even climax during the entire movie.  The only thing I liked about this film was the scenery of Tokyo.  Before I rented this DVD I checked the reviews on AMAZON and there were over 4 stars.  I'm glad to see that the dislikes now total the likes and people will get a fairer overview.
0385504209|1.0|What a dissapointment. The topic is well researched but the prose is very poorly written. He actually uses the simile &quot;the ambulance sirens cut through the night like a knife.&quot; I think I wrote that in a seventh grade paper. The religious history is interesting for those not well versed in Christian lore but is the author writing down to a median intelligence level? Not that I think all writing should make a contribution to the &quot;canon&quot; but jeez - do bestsellers have to be so cliche???

B00008CLOA|5.0|Arguably the greatest event in rock history and quite possibly the most influential recording of the 20th century and yet Sony (in their \\"infinite\\" wisom) decide to release this recording only on a niche format. Why on Earth release this as SACD only, when but a tiny percentage of the music listening market own SACD players? Just why in God's name wont Sony release this 5.1 mix on a DVD format for Joe Punchclock who can't afford the 2000 odd dollars for an SACD player or SACD compatable DVD?<br />Its such money-hungry decisions such as this that turns people against Sony and towards \\"alternate\\" music sources. <br />Grab that cash with both hands Sony.
B00018TI5E|4.0|Frusciante has succeeded in releasing an album which feels like a more artistic &quot;by the way&quot;, in which the chili peppers should rename their group to 'John Frusciante and the hot three'.  More seriously though...It's a work of art that has 50's harmonies with spooky drum machine tracks.  &quot;Carvel&quot; is a real gem as it opens the cd with a feel of psychadelic beach boys. Songs like &quot;I regret&quot; and &quot;Ricky&quot; feel like it should be 3 am drinking white wine feeling happy.  John has succeeded in producing an album that has outdone &quot;To Record Only Water For Ten Days&quot;...
0393312836|5.0|If you have only seen the Stanley Kubrik film &quot;A Clockwork Orange&quot;, you really must read the book.  The movie only shows the first twenty chapters.  While the movie is well done, it does not tell the whole story.  In most copies of the book, all twenty-one chapters are present.  Both the movie and the book are a very insightful and alaramingly realistic satire of modern day adolescents.  What Anthony Burgess wrote in 1962 seems very realistic today.<br />While the coded language or slang used by Burgess is often hard to decode, it gets easier as you read further into the book.  Alex is a rebellous and often violent teenager.  With his gang of thugs, he rules the night with violence and theft.  The crime spree continues until Alex is arrested and convicted of murder.  At this point, we see a megalomanical government attempt to intervene by committing what we might now call a human rights violation.  Through a series of dramatic episodes, classic conditioning cures Alex of his violent tendencies.  Alex is then released into a world he is forced to rediscovered.  Many of the things he once found pleasurable are now painful.  These events nearly cause Alex's demise.  It is only through his near death that the conditioning is reversed and his mind is liberated.  With a free mind, Alex is left with the prospect of finally having to act as an adult and take on adult responsibilities.<br />The controlling government is eerily reminiscent of books such as &quot;1984&quot; and &quot;Brave New World&quot;.  If you enjoyed these books or books similar to these, I suspect you would enjoy reading &quot;A Clockwork Orange&quot;.  Even if you personally find the book unreadable, you will at least learn what a &quot;clockwork orange&quot;, the name means.
B000005H3A|5.0|Jazz can be a very personal or subjective form of music.  To me Takin' Off  by Herbie Hancock is one of the best examples of early 1960's music.  Other jazz classics of this time period are generally driven by the trumpet and alto sax. Takin' Off features  no less than Freddie Hubbard, Dexter Gordon, Butch Warren, and Billy Higgins.  But it is Hancock who is in charge of tempo and mood.<br />The result is an album of grace, character and soul.  Watermelon Man, Empty Pockets and Driftin' are Hancock classics but all six original songs and the three alternate takes are first rate.<br />All of this was done by Hancock at age 22.  No wonder he was able to easily move on to other, more understated  forms of Jazz so easily (Maiden Voyage).<br />Takin' Off is very underrated and a worthy addition to any collection.
B00003CXB4|4.0|I really loved this movie. I can see where they polished it up. That's fine. As far as the extra song &quot;the morning report&quot;, it really wasn't necessary to put it in the movie. I think it was the worst song in the movie and it takes away from the original story. Everything else was a.o.k.
B00018D44U|3.0|She brings her country root this time, but waaay to many.<BR>Guess this album was meant to be the anti-climax of her groundbreaking &quot;Come away with me&quot;.<BR>Nevertheless, the die-hard fans would really enjoyed her tunes.
B0000TG9E2|3.0|The Cartoon itself is a classic. I really enjoyed that. However, the special features were at best mediocre. The games are very misleading, they really aren't games at all. The extra song for the cheshire cat was done as a 'video' in a way, with clips from the movie.<br />I think that if you're buying it for the extra features, you're going to be severely let down.
1400034779|2.0|Very light reading.  I did not draw me in.  So many better books out there.
B00005JM02|5.0|This movie is one of my favorites. I cannot get over how well PIXAR's art is! The extra features are fantastic bonuses. My son is obsessed with fish and loves the aquariums. I highly recommend this movie!
B0000AQS0F|5.0|I think the show is even better watching it the second time around on DVD.  The unaired episodes (3) were brilliant.  I especially loved the return of Saffron in &quot;Trash.&quot;  Through each of the 15 episodes, one of us watching would stop at some point and bemoan, &quot;I can't believe they cancelled this show!&quot;  Well worth the money to own this bit of TV history.
B00014TJ6Q|5.0|A wonderful and very 70-ish album, with George in fine form on nearly every track. Compares favorably with 33 1/3. A worthy addition to any Beatles/George Harrison collection. Great to have the Dark Horse catalog in release again!
B000008M1P|5.0|I just pulled this CD out after not listening to it in about 12 years! Back in College I remember really liking this disc and I wanted to see if it held up. It does! This is just a really fun CD with some great songs. &quot;Edge of a Broken Heart&quot; I think was the single and it is a really catchy tune. But I think the best song on the disc is &quot;I Want you To Rock Me&quot;. It has an infectious hook and great chorus. &quot;Cryin&quot;, &quot;Cruisin&quot; and &quot;Charmed Life&quot; are all really catchy. The guitar work on this album is great, and I don't think Vixen is given enough credit for thier musical abilities. (Maybe the tie-in with Richard Marx hurt them, who knows?)If you are a fan of Pat Benatar's music you should give Vixen a try, you won't be disappointed.
0385510438|5.0|I loved this book! Thought it was one of Grisham's best. The charaters are so real I could picture them in my mind (and I must admit I was imagining who could play them in the movie).<br />The development of J.William Traynor to Willie Traynor is believeable and interesting. The friendship between Willie and Miss Callie is sweet. I wonder how much of it was based on Willie never having a mother. I cried a little at the end which I don't remember doing while reading any of Mr.Grisham's other books.
B0000AZJXQ|5.0|A Perfect Circle's first cd is one of my all time favorites, so when this came out I had to get it. After tons of listens I've decided that Thirteenth Step, while a bit different, is just as good as their debut in its own right. Unlike their first, Thirteenth Step has a couple of filler-esk tracks in Crimes and Lullaby but these don't do much to pull down the greatness of the rest of this cd. The rest of this cd is just pure rockin' music with a sound that's not heard enough in todays rock music. It's slightly different from their first cd, with perhaps a more layered sound that has not quite as hard of an edge as their first effort, perhaps a little closer to Tool. Still it manages to be every bit as good, with great songs like Weak and Powerless (the solid single), The Noose (the instant APC classic), A Stranger (the very underrated mellow side of the cd), The Outsider (my favorite on the cd), The Nurse Who Loved Me (A great cover that shows just how much depth this band has), and Pet (one of their most rocking songs). With great songs like those this cd assured APC the title of my favorite band. This is not a cd you want to pass up. If you're a fan of any type of rock music this should be exactly what you're looking for. Be sure to check out their first cd if you haven't yet, as it is excellent.
B00008WT49|5.0|I agree with the previous review stating that the SACD mix is flawed. Even adding a +6dB boost to the subwoofer channel isn't good enough, so I have to resort to listening to the regular stereo mix instead. :(<br />Still, I give it 5 stars because it is Norah... but I will be complaining to Blue Note as well, because this is simply an amateurish error that makes me wonder if their engineers tested the mix properly. None of my other SACDs have this problem.
B000002P5W|4.0|as a hendrix fan I had to buy this cd just to update my hendrix documentary! But what a shock to hear this remastered version of hendrix songs that usually every hendrix fan should know from the original LP! Hendrix is a guitar god and in these remastered versions of the old songs there are whole guitar sections just remastered to be in the &quot;backyard&quot; of some songs, so that you can hardly hear them! So to be brief, if you are a real hendrix fan, and youve already have the LP dont buy the cd, the anger would just be to big!
0380018179|5.0|I first read this book when I was thirteen, and now, four years later I am still taken away by this novel. There are so many subtle ironies and twists that you don't catch them all at once. The story itself is beautiful, in a  very twisted sort of way. Pain is a way of life to the Cleary family and all those who come in contact with them. There is nothing that can be protected from fate and from the outback sun. From the deaths of sons to eternal bitterness to passionate love and lust, every human emotion is explored in this novel. The metaphors for life are extrodinary and very delicate. I still quote from this book regulally since it has become, it feels, so real to me. Meggie and her family come alive in your mind when reading this, the characters are so incredably vivid. An amazing read from cover to cover!
B0000AQVCL|5.0|A great CD, especially Are You Gonna Be My Girl, and Cold Hard B****.  I also really like Get Me Outta Here, and Look What You've Done has an oddly beatles remniscent quality to it.<br />A very promising band
B000001F29|4.0|love the first 30 seconds of Mr Cairo. I used to play it in the car to watch the reaction of the driver... first he looks into the rearview mirror... then sticks his head out the window while shaking his head and saying &quot;What the ..&quot;  then suddenly docks.<BR>Warning... dont play this in the car when you've got the kids with you.
B00018TI5E|5.0|So you're a fan of John's work with the Peppers, but his previous solo outings ... didn't sound very good? Shoddy sound quality? Well here finally is the definitive Frusciante album that you won't be embarrassed to play in front of family and friends. 5 stars for the production quality, 5 stars for the music. John divides his time between acoustic guitar, clean electric guitar and keyboard sounds. Together with Flea's bass and Chad's drums, there is a rich variety of textures on this album.<br />Going track by track: \\"Water,\\" \\"Second Walk\\" (stunning melodies on this track) and \\"This Cold\\" will have you up and dancing in seconds. \\"Carvel\\" rocks hard. \\"Song to Sing When I'm Lonely,\\" \\"Wednesday's Song,\\" \\"Omission\\" and \\"Chances\\" are all very beautiful songs. John's singing on Chances is his best ever; in fact his singing on the whole album is leaps and bounds ahead of his previous work. \\"Failure 33\\", \\"23 Go\\" and \\"Ghost 27\\" are a collection of strange and mesmerising sounds that thankfully don't detract from the quality of the album. The remaining vocal tracks, like the poignant \\"The Slaughter\\" and the haunting \\"Cut Out\\" are gems too. Suffice to say there isn't any filler on this album, every track having its merits.<br />Chad Smith's drumming is stellar throughout, definitely on par with anything he has ever done with the Peppers. Water has a nice bouncy bassline for Flea fans, but for the most part he plays low-key lines and allows John to shine. John's earlier solo albums may have been optional hearing for Peppers fans, but this is truly essential. Give it a few listens - you might be surprised to discover that \\"Shadows\\" has more replayability than \\"By the Way,\\" a quality that might not be apparent on your first hearing.
B00009V7PJ|5.0|I saw Cher live in Calgary, AB on August 25th 2003 and it was an AMAZING show. This DVD came out the day after oddly enough, but I still picked it up. Anytime I want to relive that amazing night, I pop in the DVD and watch and remember. This show is a testament to Cher's success, and a great overview of her career. She sings all the favorites, offers some bitchy quibbles and gives overall a great show. It was pricey but worth it to see her live! It's sad to say goodbye but she's still in top form. This is a great DVD, you won't be disapointed if you love Cher. This IS Cher, everything about this show. Some of the best performances include &quot;Still Havent Found What I'm Looking For&quot;, &quot;All Or Nothing&quot;, &quot;After All&quot;, the medleys, and more. Overall a great show you'll watch over and over!
B0001AP12G|5.0|From hearing Kanye West's freestyles and of course him being one of the best producers in the business (period)I knew it would lead up to a near perfect album. Why say &quot;near perfect&quot; and give it five stars? The beats and lyricism is superb, but his flow is just a little off and I didn't really need the &quot;New Workout Plan&quot;. Good song, but just was unecessary to sqeeze this between other stellar joints. Some of my favorite songs were; &quot;All Falls Down&quot;, &quot;Spaceship&quot;, &quot;Jesus Walks&quot;, &quot;Two Words&quot;, and a bunch of others. If you haven't bought &quot;College Dropout&quot; yet and want to listen to a modern classic of hip-hop, I definitely suggest you go out and purchase you a copy. It'll make you laugh, think, and wonder.  Overall it is a GREAT album!! Trust me!!!
006054094X|3.0|This book attempts to explain and provide evidence that the Chinese had explored most of the World in the early 15th century, before the great European explorers did.<br />This book was a very interesting read and provided alot of information into the period and medieval navigation. I thought Menzies brought a fresh prospective on the times and navigation during that period of history.<br />Menzies provides a great amount of information on the great Chinese treasure fleets, and their adventures. I found the process that the Chinese used to establish longitude incredible. Having read Sobel's book 'Longitude' made this even more fascinating.<br />However, as I got further into the book, I startted to get the feeling that Menzies was stretching the facts too much in favor of the Chinese. I think that there should have been opposing viewpoints included in the discussion.<br />This book was very interesting and will eventually lead me to read further into this period of time both from the European and the Chinese histories.
0385512104|5.0|Helps us to Understand Behavior of those with Autism<BR>This story opens with Christopher, a 15-year-old boy with a mild form of autism, discovering a neighbor's dog impaled on a garden fork. When the neighbor accuses him of murdering her dog, followed by a subsequent run-in with the police, Christopher takes it upon himself to solve the mystery of the dog's murder, and to write a book about the incident in the process. The Curious Incident of the Dog in the Night-time is Christopher's account of his investigation, written from his first hand point of view. In the process he discovers some strange twists of events that directly affect his own life. The author of this book decided to pen this from Christopher's point-of-view. It is a fascinating look at what is going on in the mind of an autistic child. Actions that the boy takes may seem insane to an outsider, but are explained in a very logical manner by Christopher. Reading books like this, such as Motherless Brooklyn which is told from the point of view of a man with Tourette's Syndrome, really help to bring some sort of understanding to those of us who may be put off by the seemingly strange behavior of a person suffering from these types of afflictions. In addition to understanding Christopher's thought patterns, the story he is telling about his investigation is quite interesting. This is a short book and well worth the time. Another short novel I recommend is The Losers' Club by Richard Perez
B0000C7PRY|5.0|I have owned this album since the day it was released, and I would argue to anyone that this is Neal's finest work yet.  I was a big fan of Snow, and still am, but I would have to admit that it was very popish sounding.  This opus has brought back the true prog side of Neal, though it still maintains the continuity that was in Snow.  As you probably know, this is a two hour long concept album of what shaped Neal into the man that he is today.  It is about his struggles, his pain, his sorrow, and eventually the tremendous joy that overcame him when he turned his life over to the Lord.  I marvel at the people who say that they are fans of Neal, but then say that this album is lame.  This album IS Neal.  As far a music, the style of this album is very similar to the old spocks beard.  I am going to assume that you know what his style is, because this one is harder to get your hands on than anything by SB.  Lets just say though, that the hammond is still soaring and that he has now employed a live string section.  He also still uses french horn and sax.<br />I would like now to comment on his voice.  I have always felt that he is an amazing singer, but that he lacked slightly in passion and emotion.  This album shocked me as far as the emotion that he can put into his voice.  It is apparent that he truely believes in his message now, and has accepted who he is.  Way to go Neal!
6305907145|1.0|I was very disappointed in this movie. I think that if Jane Austin were alive she would sue the producers! To anyone who has read the book and enjoyed it, they will be disappointed. This movie is very liberal with it's interpertation of the storyline and the characters. And as such for me it was unbearable to watch. For those who are familar with the book, in this movie,here are the following problems, (no spoilers here) Fanny is outspoken, sometimes loud and actually says &quot;yes&quot; to Mr. Crawford but later retracts it(this at Portsmouth). William is non-existent. Fanny is sent to Portsmouth as punishment for not accepting Crawford in the first place. Setherton is never visited, Maria is married after Fanny's ball, Crawford confronts Fanny about her love of Edmund and Maria runs off with Crawford after Fanny returns to Mansfield Park. The whole movie is choppy and does not flow as it does in the book. Plus additional scenes are inserted, (which are not in the book) about slavery that totally distorts the characters of Sir Thomas and son Tom. (In my opinion these scenes are not called for and destroys the characters and is opposed to what is in the book regarding them)<BR>Granted it is and adaption of the book, and I am an open-minded person and have enjoyed the other movies related to Austin's works and would highly recommend them,(Pride and Prejudice, Persuasion, Emma-either version, and Sense and Sensibility) but I must say that this movie does a dis-service to Jane Austin and the characters of Mansfield Park.
B00005JMJ4|1.0|I rented this one, What a waste of time and money.  As I have had the opportunity to travel to Japan I could not believe the self-pitying of the characters.  The movie is long, slow, boring, and only really rates an R by unnecessary inclusion of a strip joint.  Avoid this one if you can.
B00006879E|4.0|I have to admit, I bought this CD for the song &quot;Harder to Breathe&quot; but the first time I listened to it all the way through, I was disappointed. I wasn't sure if I liked it or not and I put it away. A friend convinced me to give it another try, and it's becoming one of those albums I like a little bit more every time I hear it. Very much jazz infused with a good dose of R&amp;B and rock that works very well. Definite highlights are &quot;She Will Be Loved&quot; and &quot;Must Get Out&quot;. This is a very rich album that keeps you coming back for more. Very highly recommended for those looking for something more substantial than standard Top 40 radio.
B0000CEB62|4.0|an entertaining and varied work that takes us not only into the soul of a band that influenced the masses, but into the delightful foibles and dreams of a generation. Through this creatively haphazard and joyous film, those of us who grew up in the eighties experience an uncanny flashback that reawakens all those unique emotions. Many of us are now artists, writers, business-people and mystics shaped by the chemicals and music of the time.<br />101 takes you into treasured memories - if you were there - and into a glimmer of those special times - if you were not.<br />Either way, I just can't get enough.
B00006CXXU|3.0|I bought this CD at a used music store not expecting much, but I was pleasantly surprised. I've hated the teen-pop music trend that we were all subjected to, which is, thankfully, dying, but Christina branched out and made a quality album. Unlike many of her contemporaries, Christina has an amazing vocal talent and songwriting ability. Songs like &quot;Make Over,&quot; &quot;Soar,&quot; and &quot;Fighter&quot; are her best and being such an old schooled alterna-fan, I never thought I'd enjoy anything but Christina, but she won me over. The only criticism I can add is that at 20 songs, some feel like filler and make the album overly long. Overall, I think Christina will be around for a very long time.
B00018TI5E|5.0|this albumn is awesome.  If you want to hear a great guitarist do his thing, you should defenatly check this guy out!
B0000DD7LB|2.0|I tried. I really did. I borrowed my cousin's copy of this album and I tried to appreciate it, but word of warning. If you hate Britney, you'll hate this album. Musically, this album is a total rip-off of Madonna's Erotica, which is now 12 years old. State of the art technology and this is the best she can do. Sure, there's danceable stuff on here, and I'll admit \\"Toxic\\" isn't a bad song, but I don't see this album passing the test of time like Blondie's \\"Parallel Lines\\", which is a true genre crosser and a classic work to boot. I was disappointed in \\"Early Morning\\" because I love Moby, but this totally sounds like something he spit out in five minutes and handed over. The songwriting is such a joke, like in \\"Everytime\\" (\\"I'm offering you a sorry\\"?!?! Please hand this girl a grammer book) Musically, it works for the moment, but give it ten years and people will be wondering what Britney was thinking. Sorry, but like I said-- I tried.
B00009V7T2|5.0|I must say, I purchased this because I had heard rave reviews constantly and it was only $9. At first, I didn't care for it all that much...mostly because I didn't think it lived up to it's reputation even though it was a good album. <br />Suddenly, I've been listening to it non-stop. This is one solid, awesome as all hell album. The lyrics positively blow the mind here. Also, everything about it has a common theme. You feel like they're telling the story of a dark novel. <BR>Here's the best way to experience this album: <BR>Go into a bedroom at night, cover the windows, close the door, and turn out the lights for total darkness. Then put on a pair of headphones and press play. <BR>You will feel like you are in a dark, cold, damp, rat-infested medieval dungeon, and the only relief is the soothing yet ghostly sound of the incredible vocals behind the eerie sounds and guitars and the cryptic lyrics. <br />This is one of the best albums in recent years.
B000092ZYX|4.0|This album has a good balance to it. It contains elements from most of their previous albums, and somehow blends together quite well. My favorite tracks are &quot;2+2=5&quot;, &quot;Go to Sleep&quot;, &quot;There,there&quot;, and &quot;A Punch-Up at a Wedding.&quot; &quot;A Punch-Up at a Wedding&quot; is definitely one of the best songs they've even written, and &quot;Go to Sleep&quot; is awesome as well. I'd give this album 4 stars just for those 2 alone.<BR>I'm not a big fan of all the electronic stuff, so Kid A and Amensiac aren't my favorite albums, and some of these songs contain too much electronic fakery. &quot;Sit Down. Stand Up.&quot; would be a killer song except of the very end, where the techno kicks in and the annoying repetition of &quot;Raindrops&quot; keep going and going and going...<BR>Tracks that aren't too great are &quot;I Will&quot;, &quot;The Gloaming&quot; and &quot;Myxomatosis&quot;, the latter of these sound something like Beck would write in 1996. <BR>All in all, this is good album, but I wouldn't recommend this one for someone who wants to get into Radiohead for the first time. Buy OK Computer and the Bends. You won't be disappointed.
B000069AUI|2.0|When you hear the three singles, (&quot;In My Place&quot;, &quot;Clocks&quot;, &quot;The Scientist&quot;) you expect a masterpiece. But have you ever seen a trailer for a comedy film that looked great, but was disappointing because the trailer gave away all the funny parts? Same thing with this album. The three singles are worth it though. Just skip the rest of the generic filler.
B00018D44U|4.0|I admit that when I first heard the album, I felt disappointed. But on the second listen, I began to hear it for what it is: Fine music, obviously different from the previous album, but fine music nevertheless. I'm enjoying it more and more.
B0000UJL96|4.0|The picture is nice and crispy and the extras are good. Nice tribute to late Deforest Kelly. Unfortunately the 2,35:1 picture is not 2,35:1 but 1,85:1. Can anyone explain why? Maybe they opened up the matte 'cause it was shot in Super 35. Is that it? They are not cutting anythong on the sides, right?<br />Victor from Portugal
B00018D44U|5.0|I don't know why it took a few listens to really appreciate this CD. Maybe because I was so used to hearing all of the songs on Come Away with me, so I had to get used to hearing the new stuff. But, it sounds great! I don't know where some reviewers are coming from who is say it's boring or sounds like the previous CD. I think she has such a wonderful voice and these songs are all new and different but definitely Norah. I love it.
B00000F14B|1.0|The Music Man was not at all what I expected. I bought it for a family movie night, we love musicals usually. This was so boring you could barely make it through it. Actually, I made myself finish it because i spent money on it. I will be tossing it or passing it on.  If anyone's interested, it's going cheap!
B0001ADB8C|3.0|I am as big a George Harrison fan, who only sees this boxed set as a must have, if you want to spend over $100 bucks just to own it.  The reality is, most Harrison fans had already owned these cd's before they went out of print.  I would not recommend this set for the casual fan.  Instead I would recommend, buying the two essential Dark Horse cd's &quot;Thirty Three And A Third&quot;, and &quot;Cloud Nine&quot;.  Let's face it, some of these albums like &quot;Gone Troppo&quot;, and &quot;Somewhere In England&quot;, were not very good.  I know the hardcore fans are going to justify its purchase, because of a few demo bonus tracks and remastering, and of course the DVD that comes with it, but this remains a pricey option, if you already own the original cd's!  The music industry, has used this digitally remastered and bonus track shtick to complete nauseum, in an attempt to sell music to fans in hope that they will buy into it, and replace their original versions. Notice, they did not re-issue the single disc best of &quot;Dark Horse&quot; collection, which would have been perfect for the casual fan, but would hurt sales of this boxed set. What Capital should have done was release a complete career spanning boxed set, taking the best tracks from &quot;All Things Must Pass&quot;, to &quot;Live In  Japan&quot;, Which is exactly what most fans would have wanted!  This is why the music industry is in shambles.  George deserves better.
B00005JMJ4|5.0|I just read over a bunch of the negative reviews here that kind of just freaked me out. We're living in a world full of soulless, cultureless, out-of-touch people, which is exactly what this movie was pointing out. Maybe that's why they hated it. What do we all have the most trouble with in others - the negative qualities we see in ourselves. But I guess that's why when two people really do connect, it feels as special as this movie successfully portrays it. Because in a world full of sheep, the wolves are mighty lonely.
B00001X590|5.0|Joe Cocker's 1969 debut album &quot;With a Little Help From My Friends&quot;, is without question, one of the greatest debut albums of the classic rock era.  This release packs a punch from the very start.  Beside the title track, which is one of the most recognized rock songs ever recorded, Joe is simply stunning, on tracks like &quot;Feeling Alright&quot;, which also was a huge hit and his version of &quot;Bye Bye Blackbird&quot;.  His take on Dylan's &quot;I Shall Be Released&quot;, and &quot;Just Like A Woman&quot; are some of the most gut wrenching, and emotional versions of these songs ever waxed.  At the time of it's release 35 years ago, rock and soul had never been blended, with such power and grace.  Jimmy Page and Stevie Winwood along with B.J Wilson and long time Cocker keyboard man Chris Stainton, were all part of the supporting cast, that helped this album become a huge hit, that propelled Joe Cocker to rock stardom, that continues to this day, some 35 years later.
B0000E2FLC|5.0|When this video was released way back in the nineties, I ran to the store to buy it.  After seeing countless other concert videos since, I still say this is the absolute best live show you can find on DVD.  The photography is beautiful, the editing is a good mix of band/audience footage, the sound quality beats anything, and come on, it's AC/DC--no other band could ever compare to these guys live!  I've waited for this to come out on DVD for over a decade!
B00009P1O0|5.0|Amazon says it is &quot;underproduced&quot;....this is exactly why it is such a good CD.  If you know Neil Young, then you know what he is about and this CD is one of his best efforts.  It reflects what was going on in his life better than most of his efforts.  It's rough, unpolished and very real.  Who could ask for more?  In all the efforts that the Dead tried to do to capture their &quot;live&quot; sound, Neil succeeded with this effort.  I've been waiting for years for this to come out on CD.
B00005JMEW|3.0|Okay, it's a decent movie, and yes I'd like to own it but why would you buy this release. Have a little patience because this is a cash grab no different then splitting the movie in 2 for it's theatrical release. Wait until after Vol. 2 has been put out and but the big box set you know is on the way with both Vol. 1 and 2 and likely all sorts of extras. Shame on Tarantino for breaking this movie into 2 pieces in the first place, if legions of Hollywood guppies will sit through 3 hour movies like Dances with Wolves or Titanic surely Tarantino fan's would have sat through this film in it's entirety.
B000089RVX|5.0|Grammy's Best New Artist Laureate Evanescence's debut album in 2003 has everything true rock fans really want. Amy Lee's lead vocal is sensitive yet intensive, a rare female vocalist that hard/melodic/modern rock appreciators have been looking for. In addition, this is the finest modern rock album I have heard since Matchbox 20's Mad Season. Secret of success lies not only in Amy's vocal but also in excellent production and tight yet catchy arrangement that should be palpable to even 70's and 80's pop rock appreciators.<br />Actually, GOING UNDER is the very reason I started hooked up in this album. It is a classic pop hard rock anthem. BRING ME TO LIFE that became a huge hit is another gem but this is only a part of the album's appeal. Actually, I ended up loving the whole album. Particularly ballads are excellent such as MY IMMORTAL and HELLO. Ethereal chorus will captivate those who listen to this album.<br />I hoped they would grab more of the grammies and so far, this is my album of the year for 2003.
B00018HU4U|1.0|I have no real idea if I like this album or not as I have returned it due to the fact that the disk has copy protection on it. Since I refuse to buy CDs that have this (as it is not part of the CD standard) I have not had a chance to listen to the complete CD. <BR>Beware if you are planning to buy this album that it has CD copy protection on it.<br />P.S. Amazon should be including this warning on items that contain copy protection since I have had these types of disks cause problems with my equipment.
0375422307|5.0|How truthful and delicate!  I wish we could read history and political views from a child's point of view more often.  Though the author's charm made me laugh at times, I cried wholeheartedly at the human tragedies.  It was a cleansing experience.  The author was looking back at a life millions of people were forced to live.  The author was living a life I used to live.  The author was me with a different name and face.
B00018D44U|5.0|This album is even better than Come Away With Me.  It's not too much of a departure from that album, but Norah has definitely shown growth as musician.  She has written or co-written 6 of the 13 songs on this album, compared to 2 or 3 on her first album.  Norah's voice sounds as beautiful as ever.   Feels Like Home gets better and better with each listen.  This just proves that Norah deserved all of the Grammy awards she received last year.  It's so refreshing to see a real singer with a real band in a music industry filled with synthesizers and fake music.  <br />It's very hard for me to pick a favorite track as they are all wonderful.  Trust me.. you will not regret buying Feels Like Home.
B00004T1NA|5.0|The first thing that comes to mind when i think of the Porcupine Tree: sheer brilliance! Everything they come up with blows me away. Lightbulb Sun on the other hand did so much more than that. I love the way they have brought the appeal of the rock journey back to album making. They tell stories so well it feels as if you are right there. After hearing this album for the first time, I thought one thing: ex-girlfriend. all the pain of losing someone close to you, all the feeling laid right out in front of you, all the memories. This album really struck a chord, physically and literally. <br />   Enough about how it made me feel...the music speaks for itself. Of the entire PT catalogue, this album was the best laid out, most well written, it's as if it's one very long song. the cd starts out with the title track &quot;Lightbulb Sun&quot;, a quiet acoustic guitar and some angelic vocals, but suddenly you get the feeling your a part of something great when the band eplodes in from behind and takes over the rest of the track. a deep, dark, soothing song, gets you in the mood for more. Then the pain and feeling begin with songs like &quot;How Is Your Life Today?&quot; and &quot;Shesmovedon&quot;. They continue with the arena rocker &quot;Hatesong&quot; with some watery electric guitars near the end, remeniscent of Pink Floyd's &quot;Breathe (reprise)&quot;. The album is closed with two of my favorite tracks on the album. &quot;Russia On Ice&quot; from my understanding, is a dark tale of a man drinking himself to death. Great lyrics accompanied with killer guitars. And finally &quot;Feel So Low&quot;, which pretty much summerizes the entire mood of the album. One of the last things you hear is Steven Wilson utter the word &quot;thanks&quot;, but who exactly is he thanking? Listen to this album to find out. You won't be dissapointed! 5 stars!!!
B00014TJ6Q|5.0|The rerelease of several &quot;middle period&quot; George Harrison albums is welcome news to both Beatles fans and pop/rock music fans in general. All of the albums that have now been made available on CD contain many songs worth reacquainting oneself with or discovering for the first time. But I think this album represents his best effort in this period and it, like much of his work, is terribly underrated. &quot;Love Comes to Everyone&quot; would have been right at home on &quot;Rubber Soul&quot;, and there are several other cuts on this CD that display gracefully the familiar mixture of sweetness, melodicism, and that distinctive guitar sound that constitute Harrison's style at its best.<br />Perhaps it is a blessing that so many of these albums have been unavailable for such a long time on CD. If any artist deserves a reevaluation, it's Harrison, who always seems vulnerable to the invidious comparison: he's good but he is no Lennon or McCartney. While there is truth in that, there is also truth in the fact that too much of his work has been dismissed all too easily. If he is no John or Paul, he nonetheless is a superb craftsman and song writer who just happened to find himself always in the shadows of his legendary bandmates. Maybe now with so much time having passed since the Beatles and with the lack of familiarity with the newly rereleased material that its absence has caused, we can begin to rediscover Harrison's immense gifts and appreciate them on their own terms. He wrote a lot of beautiful music and it deserves to be heard.
B00006879E|5.0|I know I'm not the first person to say that it's hard to describe Maroon Five's unique sound. The only word that comes to mind is AMAZING! Their unique blend of R&amp;B, pop, &amp; rock captures you the second you start to listen to their music. The music world was overdue in releasing a musical act with true talent. Not one song sounds like the last. Each song is unique and has its own feel and groove. This CD will give you the chills (of course, in a good way).
B00018TI5E|5.0|I bought this album, expecting nothing but the best, and that is exactly what I got. This is by far the best recording by John Frusciante. I have been a long time fan of RHCP and of John Frusciante and I love his solo work. This album is well thought out and simply amazing. Oh and by the way the song on the Live At Slane DVD is called &quot;Maybe&quot;, a cover of an old song by The Chantels. Which was also done by The Three Degrees, but of course all you &quot;fans of music&quot; already knew that.
B0000039PW|1.0|First Of All, 2Pac Is Better than Biggie, he Rhymes Better than<BR>biggie did. Also, Who Would put A Skit Like that on a Cd? <BR>Biggie Is Horrible, 2Pac Is Good. But there's like one good song<BR>on this album: Big Poppa. Otherwise, Don't Get This!!
0689859368|2.0|Initially turned off by the similarity in binding to the Lemony Snicket series, I decided it was unfair to blame the author for the marketing department's attempt to copy a good thing, so I bought it.<br />While not completely horrible, it's very, very insignificant.  The illustrations are the best part of it, and the story has so many of them, and so few words, that it's more a picture book than a novel (or part of a novel), despite its tone being a little mature for those for whom a picture book would be appropriate.<br />Essentially nothing happens, which would be all right if it didn't happen in an entertaining and well-written manner, but I'm sorry, in this case things fail to happen in a pedestrian way.<br />It seems that magical beings may be in-and-or-around the new home of our three undeveloped (save for character tics--one fences, one collects animals) main characters.  When they finally meet one near the end of the volume (you knew this would happen eventually, but the characters shouldn't be as knowing) they react with such little surprise, such lack of wonder, that any residual hope I had for the story quite withered away.<br />(I read the second one and though slightly more filled with incident, it was no better written.)<br />For weird houses with secrets, turn to John Bellairs.  For encounters with strange magical creatures, go to E. Nesbit, or one of dozens of others much, much more enjoyable.<br />Note: a 3 star ranking from me is actually pretty good; I reserve 4 stars for tremendously good works, and 5 only for the rare few that are or ought to be classic; unfortunately most books published are 2 or less.
B000002KYR|5.0|This album spawned four Top 20 hits. They are GIMME ALL YOUR LOVIN',SHARP DRESSED MAN,GOT ME UNDER PRESSURE and LEGS. TV DINNERS is a minor hit and was later covered by the late Robert Palmer. Logically,Dusty Hill and Billy Gibbons are the ones with long beards and Frank Beard,only sports a mustache. Their follow-up,AFTERBURNER would be the second megahit for them. All the aforementioned songs were recycled for the GREATEST HITS compilation,released in 1992,nine years after this album.
0385504209|1.0|Renowned author Dan Brown watched with justifiable pride as the printer spat forth the final page of his just-completed manuscript.  He smiled wanly with smug satisfaction, knowing that he had successfully butchered theology, history, a score of other academic disciplines and English syntax like a slaughterhouse with a new McDonald's contract.  As he encased the freshly printed manuscript in regulation-brown post-office wrapping paper, Dan couldn't help but notice that it was as thick as three stubbed-out Gitanes laid end-to-end.  How could anyone smoke Gitanes, those practically toxic cigarettes you can mercifully find only in France? Dan thought.  He shook his head in disbelief, then deftly placed the return address sticker on the package.  By now his obviously fertile imagination was doing cartwheels, and he could already see the lightly fluttering bosoms of female talk-show hostesses earnestly inquiring how such a young man could have such deep knowledge of so many profound subjects.  He silently chuckled to himself as he imagined one or two of them confiding, You can uncover the truth of my sacred feminine anytime.  Dan strode to the curb, thrust the package into the mailbox and raised the bright red metal flag, now standing before him like a miniature Eiffel Tower as monument to a goodly year's worth of sweat, tears and sangre.
B0000C0FJB|3.0|There seems to be basically two different opinions presented forth in terms of the sound quality on Rush in Rio.   Some find the sound excellent, while others beg to differ. Personally, I rarely buy live recordings because I actually do prefer the polished studio product over a live recording. Filled with energy or not, live recordings rarely give me much to get excited about, with perhaps ELP and a precious few others being the exception.<br />On the Rush in Rio CD the crowd &quot;noise&quot; is very apparent. Then again, take a look at the SIZE of the crowd that is at the show! While I do find all the chatter and crowd sounds a tad overwhelming, and yes, even annoying, I do resign to the fact that this IS a LIVE show and one can expect the decision making (when doing the mixing) could go a number of ways. In this case, it seems that the live experience was allowed to be taken to a pronounced if not exagerrated level. And here is essentially where opinions are divided.<br />Some listeners wont mind, some will complain, I find myself somewhere in the middle. Pick your poison. Aside from that, Rush was and still is a tight, talented, intelligent band that has thrilled fans for decades. And fortunately, there is still enough of Rush, and good Rush at that on this 3 CD package. The set list speaks for itself. Take it or leave it.
B00005Y7GQ|5.0|Oh man, this is such an incredible movie!  Watched it with my friends, we very nearly died laughing!  Make sure you get it with the subtitles, they're so horribly great...  I had no idea they could do a modern-day film that so perfectly captured the spirit shown in early kung-fu movies. &quot;We can beat the Evil Team!&quot;
B0000AQS0F|5.0|I bought this DVD without watching any of the shows that aired on FOX.  If you are like me don't worry.  Firefly goes down as one of my favorite shows of all time.  Also, some great news that I just read on fireflymovie.com there will be a movie titled Serenity.  The have added the movie Serenity on the coming soon section on Universal Studios website.
B00004RFFS|3.0|This movie was initially a disappointment as it deviated quite a bit from the book by Rice. It totally skipped Lestat's tortured, painful childhood, and missed out on much of the other subtleties that Rice created in the character, turning a three-dimensional, very realistic (given that it's a fantasy creature) character into a stereotype vampire. Frankly, Tom Cruise was totally uninspiring in his role as Lestat such that until the closing scene of the movie I didn't even realise that the part had such 'stellar' casting. <br />Given the nature of the book and plot, with its chronological timeframe spanning hundreds of years, it's impossible for the movie to be fast-paced as an action flick, as criticized by some reviewers, but I think that in its slower pace it has remained true to the book's Gothic, brooding atmosphere.<br />Although Brad Pitt does /not/ look the part of Louis (at all!), he has managed to do a wonderful job portraying the adolescent, conflicted vampire and Kirsten Dunst shows her talent in her portrayal of a woman trapped in a child's body, two major redeeming points for the movie.<br />But perhaps the best touch to the movie, IMO, is the last scene where Lestat regains life. It was this scene which totally revised my opinion of the movie, though it was not in the book. Perhaps because it was so symbolic of the undead's clasping greed for life that is the core of Anne Rice's vampire, the vitality, exuberance and speed as evinced by Lestat and showed such promise for a movie of the next book.
B0000AUHPB|4.0|The original ITALIAN JOB is one of those &quot;little&quot; movies that won't go away as it continues to reap the dividends of having been done with panache and style.<BR>Michael Cane's Charlie character is an artist working effortlessly in aloof charm. He's the kind confident character you'll admire  like Murphy in CUCKOO'S NEST in spite of the obvious reasons not to. There is seductive music and beautiful scenery and plenty of restrained continental humor.<BR>I have no interest in cars, but even I admitt the classic models of the time featured here are beautiful and add to the ambiance of elegance infusing the scenes .<BR>The chase is more clever than thrilling although the site of four cars performing on the top of a tall rounded building still makes me shake my head when I see it thinking they must have been mad. Remember, no remote control models or studio set ups were used here.  That car jumping from roof to roof is real.<BR>Don't come here looking for an action adventure though - it's more adult than that albeit geared for adults of another generation. <BR>Director Collinson's influence makes the movie as good as it could possibly have been.  The art direction  also contributes strongly throughout. Because this version is so good, I am not tempted to see the remake. Why?<BR>Basically; it must have been pretty impressive then and it's definately fun now. Sometimes all you want is a little fun with a dash of style.
B00006879E|5.0|I first heard of Maroon 5 from the Love Actually soundtrack and was intrigued by their name. I didn't pay much attention until I heard &quot;This Love&quot; as a Buzzworthy clip on MTV and was blown away by what I heard. Now I'm addicted to this album! You will not be disappointed if you bought this album! It's great and Maroon 5 is a great band with a unique sound! Buy it!
B00005V9IL|1.0|Like coffee with so much milk and sugar you can't taste the coffee, so the Abyss pours on so many &quot;special&quot; effects that you can't stomach the movie.  I saw this big hunk o' nothin' in the theatre and the whole house walked out in silence shaking their heads.  I doubt if fifteen years of ripening will have made it any more palatable.  Indulgent, excessive and ultimately juvenile fluff.
B00003CXTG|1.0|Should be renamed Ben Affleck fights WWII.  Ben fights the Battle of Britain, Ben gets shot down and hides out with the French resistance, Ben escapes France and flies 1/2 way around the world and arrives in Hawaii one day before the Pearl Harbor attack.  Ben then jumps into a fighter, even though he is still technically a civilian because he left the service to fight in the RAF, and then proceeds to shot down Japanese attackers.  After a hard day of arial dog fights, Ben lands and proceeds to rescue trapped sailors at Pearl Harbor!  To cap it all off Ben jumps into Jimmy Doolittle group to fly bombers (even though he is a fighter pilot) and attack Tokyo.  I wonder why they left out Ben's contribution to the sinking of the Bismark and the Battles of El Alamein and Dunkirk?<br />Throw in a tedious and unbelievable love triangle and you have an over reaching big budget snoozer. <br />Special effects on the actual Pearl Harbor attack are very good, but hardly enough to make up for a terrible plot and equally terrible acting.
0385504209|5.0|Brown's novel tells a great fictional story, but it is his use of history,combined with numerous puzzles, that make this novel special. I can see how the historical theories presented would be unsettling to those who have never seriously questioned the origins of organized religion, Christian or otherwise. As is true of any great work of art, the novel left me hungry for more information and discussion of the multiple topics introduced. His ability to bring these issues to the masses in a well-researched novel is nothing short of brilliant!
B00009W0WM|5.0|I never tire of watching this movie and take delight in all the characters.  That the story is a bit convoluted is irrelevant.  But all the moods work, whether the terror in the opening shot of the man running from the police, or the depth of love in Paris, or the affection of everyone for Sam, or the spirit at Rick's, or tears during La Marsielles, or of the relationship between Ilsa and Victor . . this is as close to the perfect movie as I've ever seen . .
0440238609|5.0|I would echo all the praise that others have lavished on these books - they're magical.<br />But the person who says they are not an attack on religion is just plain wrong - Pullman has publicly said, on many occasions, that (and I paraphrase) he believes that religion is superstitious nonsense, and is very clear that the books are, indeed, partly intended to show just how ludicrous many religious beliefs are. These are complex allegories, and religion is right there in the middle of his allegorical gunsight.
B00004SU5J|5.0|Whereas the spirit of jazz seems to have been castrated here in the United States, giving birth to all sorts of perverse \\"smooth jazz\\" incarnations, elsewhere in the world - particularly in France, it would seem - jazz is dancing and celebrating life as passionately as ever.<br />St. Germain is a wonderfully delicious mix of house beats and jazz improvisation; rather than rehash old jazz tunes and subject them to an electronica-plastered martyrdom, St. Germain - Ludovic Navarre and company - use live instrumentation for their creative and intoxicating mix.  A little Latin groove here, some hip-hop and r&b there, a driving house beat and downright manic solos all fit together to remind us of what it is that jazz is supposed to be.<br />This is one of the few CDs that I own that really seems to cross over and through the various genre gaps; it is smooth - that is, sexy and classy (without being pretentious) at the same time - but also has an excess of pizazz that keeps the listener engaged and flowing.  Such genre-bending both subverts and converts jazz as it has been and propells it into a potential future-made-present; the rumors of a better sound are heard here as a whisper expressed in symphonic song.<br />Perhaps[?] oddly enough, everyone that I have ever played this CD for - whether a 19 year-old Marine, a banker in her mid-40s, or college students that prefer rap and its various metal cross-breeds - liked it.  While I doubt world peace will begin with bringing the people together to listen to St. Germain's \\"Tourist\\", at the same time there really is something ... beautiful about so many different people being able to listen to and appreciate the same music.  It whispers something of the beauty within human subjects.<br />This is a really, really great CD; 5 stars does not do it justice as it is in a class of its own, far beyond the all-too-quantitative measurement of 5 stars.  It breathes spirit and creativity - the best that music as expression and imaginationhas to offer.  Paint your canvas with some passionate new colors; bring the diaspora of your friends together...
B00003CXDV|5.0|All movies don't have to be great. A good one will seem great in the Milky Way of mediocrity known as the film industry.<BR>GALAXY QUEST, simply put, starts out well and continues without a dip at a high entertainment speed.  It's well written and the jokes are funny.  The cast do a great job and, again, are very funny. <BR>As an added bonus it's a movie you can watch with your best buddy - the kid (Mild language notwithstanding).<BR>There are bountiful references to STAR TRECK but they don't matter. <BR> The film has a good decent budget look to it and for once the CGI effects add to the film rather than take it over.
B00018D44U|3.0|I bought this CD really really wanting to love it, just as I loved NJ's debut album &quot;Come Away With Me&quot; which truly deserved to sell its 8M copies and also because Jones is a gorgeous woman both visually and vocally.<br />Unfortunately it's been a hard slog.  Unlike her first album, Jones wrote most of the songs here herself.  They turn out to be simply mediocre tunes, despite Jones' beautiful voice and refreshingly spare style.  Not terrible, but nothing special---lyrically nor melodically.  Just very forgettable.  The best ones are her covers of Tom Waits' &quot;The Long Way Home&quot; and Duke Ellington's &quot;Melancholia&quot; which she renames &quot;Don't Miss You At All.&quot;<br />Oh yeah, and the country-ish twang really needs to go.  Sigh.  Norah Norah, PLEASE COME *HOME*!!!
630514415X|5.0|I didn't pay attention to \\"He Got Game\\" when it first came out, since I'm not a big basketball fan.  Boy was I pleasantly surprised when I did see it.<br />I think it's one of Spike Lee's best movies.  \\"He Got Game\\" covers lots of issues: interracial dating, black stereotypes, the college athlete, corruption in college athletics, the politics behind sports, the incarceration of Black men, and most of all, a father trying to make amends with his son.<br />\\"He Got Game\\" is loaded with symbolism, each time you see it, you will pick up something new (the kids names: &quot;Mary&quot; and &quot;Jesus&quot;; the last basketball shot, etc.).<br />Most of all, I recommend this movie to you because I find it touching, and felt emotions that I certainly did not expect from a Spike Lee movie.  My suggestion: see it for Father's Day!
B00005JMJ4|4.0|He is famous, he is fawned on by well-paying Japanese clients, but he is frustrated in his professional life (wanting to be a stage actor) and he has problems at home.  What does he need to find a more meaningful existence, for more self-fulfillment.  She has made what seems to be a bad marriage, with a man whose entry to the world means passing through mindless no-talent personalities, and denegrating his wife . . . what does she need for self-fullfillment.  The choice of Japan with fake dinosaurs flashing on the screen, with ersatz Western parties and Western style clubs and Western style everything else gives us a picture of incinserity that parallels the lives of the two main characters.  This movie portrays a slice of life, that is perhaps more genuine than so many other attempts.  These two don't jump into bed with each other, no overt voiolence . . just an almost overbearing sadness where one would expect something a bit more uplifting . . . and it can happen to people of any age.
B00000255F|5.0|I am not a big fan of Bruce Springsteen's music but I do own a couple of his cds, namely &quot;Nebraska&quot; and &quot;Born to Run&quot;, the album that broke him into mainstream music. I bought &quot;Nebraska&quot; because of the tribute album &quot;Badlands&quot; a few years ago. I bought &quot;Born to Run&quot; because I love the song &quot;Thunder Road&quot;. I recently decided to listen to the cd for the first time in 2-3 years that I had owned it. Unlike a lot of albums released today, &quot;Born to Run&quot; surprisingly still holds up well amidst the current music scene of whiny nu-metal and talentless pop singers. A mix of rock and blues, &quot;Born to Run&quot; is an epic record that is filled with hope which is rare to hear in modern music nowadays. It really captures the blue-collar, New Jersey roots of Bruce Springsteen. &quot;Thunder Road&quot; is definitely my favorite song off the album but I also really love the opening melodies to &quot;Night&quot;. The title track is a classic that doesn't really need to be mentioned but I will mention it as another favorite song of mine off the album. I also love the tender ballad &quot;She's the One&quot;. It is one of Bruce's better ballads that still manages to maintain that gritty sound heard on &quot;Thunder Road&quot; and &quot;Tenth Avenue Freeze Out&quot;. In twenty years down the road, are people still going to remember Limp Bizkit or Bruce Springsteen? I seriously doubt it will be Limp Bizkit. Bruce Springsteen champions for the hard working blue-collar folk like me. He writes music that fills people with hope. Limp Bizkit won't be remembered for much other than massacring a George Michael song.
B00005JMJ4|5.0|For those who are writing bad reviews, there are two conclusions:<br />1)  You saw the movie after hearing a lot of hype.  NO MOVIE ever lives up to hype...its unfortunate, but true.  People lose the point of the movie, because they have set up great expectations.<br />2)  You are dumb, you'll always be dumb, you don't realize it, and you'll never understand movies like this.  The movie is not a slapstick comedy. The movie is about feeling lonely, isolated, a fish out of water, and coming to grips with life's odd and quiet moments.  I laughed at one reviewer who said &quot;Why don't they just go out and shop.&quot;  Not all of us see life as one big purchase.  For those who said &quot;it's too slow&quot;, yes it is: that's the point.  And Bill Murray, who is a comic genius, was able to tame his wackiness and make it about a real person, not Bill Murray.  Can't find the funny moments (said one reviewer): try the japanese direction scene, the lick my stocking scene, and the japanese talk show...its not Kids in the Hall comedy, its slice-of-life comedy.  Morons.  Go back to Jerry Bruckheimer films...don't bother the rest of us with your stupidity.
B000002V1D|5.0|DURAN DURAN'S THE WEDDING ALBUM IS ONE OF THE GREATEST ALBUMS OF ALL TIME. THIS ALBUM WAS A GIGANTIC SUCCESS IMMEDIATELY UPON ITS RELEASE. THIS ALBUM CONTINUES TO BE A GIGANTIC SUCCESS. THIS GREAT ALBUM SPAWNED 3 AMAZING GREAT SINGLES- ORDINARY WORLD, COME UNDONE, AND TOO MUCH INFORMATION. ALL 3 SINGLES WERE MASSIVE SUCCESSS STAYING IN THE TOP OF THE BILLBOARD POP ALBUM CHART FOR A LONG TIME. THESE GREAT SONGS ARE TIMELESS. DURAN DURAN'S TREMENDOUS SUCCESS WAS VERY OBVIOUS THE YEAR THIS GREAT ALBUM CAME OUT, EITH THE BAND RECEIVING A STAR ON HOLLYWOOD WALK OF FAME THE SAME YEAR THIS ALBUM CAME OUT. THIS ALBUM IS GREAT. ANYONE WHO LISTENS TO THIS GFREAT ALBUM WILL SEE WHY DURAN DURAN ARE ONE OF THE GREATEST BANDS IN HISTORY, AND ARE LEGENDS AND SUPER LEGENDS. ITS EASY TO SEE WHY DURAN DURAN'S POPULARITY KEEPS GROWING YEAR AFTER YEAR, DECADE AFTER DECADE, CONSTANTLY BECOMING MORE SUCCESSFULL, AND MMORE POPULAR, CROSSING OVER TO ALL GENERATIONS. I HIGHLY RECOMEND THIS GREAT ALBUM TO EVERYONE.
B0000AQVCL|5.0|It is such a relief that rock is back and in the hands of 4 scruffy young Australians. All of the good influences are there - The Beatles, The Rolling Stones, The Kinks, AC/DC - but they are fused together with enough originality, it doesn't feel like you are being conned.  It is great to see a band, especially a young band, that is not afraid of diversity - Absolute rockin songs (Take It or Leave It and Last Chance) through to strong sincere ballads (Move On and Look What You've Done) and the lyrically light hearted and Rollover DJ (\\"a pill popping juke box is all that you are\\") and Cold Hard B**** (an ode to oral sex) to the more deeply personal Timothy (about the death of an older sibling).
0671027387|4.0|There are two ways to review this book.  The first way is simply to say I read it without wanting to put it down as it was fast paced, exciting and a fun book to read.  The second way is to say that it was based on a totally ridiculous premise and was way way over the top.<br />If you get hung up on technical problems, unrealistic scenarios, villains that make dumb mistakes and hero's that get rescued at the last second by miraculous means, then skip this book because it will just make you mad.  If, however, you can look past the problems and just enjoy the story, you'll enjoy this novel as Brown is a strong story teller.  It was a lot of fun to read and I look forward to the next one.
0790749815|3.0|So many scenes are forced and not credible, when you think about it.  Why was he lured to an open field and how was a plane supposed to kill him .. why not just run him down on a Chicago Street, or just knife him, as was done at the UN.  And why was that fellow killed at the UN anyway?  It seems the only reason was to put Cary Grant in the position of a murder . . he could have murdered anyone, anywhere . . .   How convenient that Cary Grant just hapened to meet Van Dam's mistress on the train and why did she lead him on and then drop him.  Makes no sense.  Either does it make sense that his mother is his own age  . . . couldn't they find an actress at least ten years older than him.  She looks his own age too.  This movie doesn't wear well at all...
0465068359|5.0|I really enjoyed the book.  However, I am dismayed by the fact that the same user/reviewer is allowed to post multiple reviews for a book on Amazon.  In particular, the reviewer Kent seems to have nothing better to do than write negative reviews for this book.  I found Kent's comment regarding an incident that happened at the Marco Polo Bridge (in China) ironic - &quot;Even after the &quot;Lokoukyou Incident&quot;, the Chinese Army continued to provoke the Japanese Army&quot; - being that the Japanese Army was in China at the time.  Hey Kent, sometimes the truth hurts.
B000089CJI|1.0|If u like terrible music with terrible vacalists, u'll enjoy The Postal Service.  This is untalented stuff, sounds like lame 80's nintendo sounds were used to make this album.  Don't waste ur time or money.
B0000CGV00|5.0|This new recording made by Helene Grimaud proves eventually that classical music isn't as narrow as some people tend to say.  The program presented has been carefully planed by the artist(listen for example to the allusion to the Tempest Sonata achieved by Grimaud, just after the first orchestral entry of Beethoven's Choral Fantasy) <br />Besides this architectural aspect, one can agree that Grimaud's charisma is indeed unique.  The way she captures such intensity in Corigliano's Fantasia, with such a small thematic material, is incredible, as in Beethoven's Choral Fantasy, a work that some would define as a &quot;minor&quot; piece, but which takes all its expression under Grimaud's fingers.<br />As for the Credo - which is also the title of the recording (a very rare attempt for a classical album) - although I like it a bit less, the imagination and the enthousiasm that emanates from the pianist are just fabulous, and makes the work enjoyable.<br />Both Salonen and the orchstra have done a great job, with such conviction that one can only love this recording.<br />For French speaking fans of Helene Grimaud, I invite them to buy immediately on Amazon's french site her own &quot;biography&quot; she wrote beautifully - I do not exaggerate - by herself, Variations Sauvages (Wild Variations), in which, besides her qualities as a writer, shows us (just like in the booklet of the CD) that she is also a very fine philosopher.

B0000DZEA1|5.0|This soundtrack is simply amazing. From start to finish, I was enthralled by the beautiful sounds of Middle-Earth that Howard Shore has created.<br />A Storm Is Coming is a combination of several past sounds with new music incorporated into one beautiful introduction. Hope And Memory is one of my favourites; in fact its my ultimate favourite! This part was when Gandalf and Peregrin Took ride to Minas Tirith. A touching piece. Minas Tirith theme is another awesome track with loud and bold sounds of the horn. With the voice of Ben del Mestro adds more color and beauty to the city of Minas Tirith. <br />The Steward Of Gondor is a wonderful piece with the voice of Billy Boyd (when Gondor's army march to the city of Osgilliath to retake it under the order of Lord Denethor). It sounds so sad in the end. <br />Another of my favorites is Twilight And Shadow. I must confess that ALL compositions by Howard for the Elf kind is always soothing and filled with so much emotions. This song is so sad when Arwen is leaving to the West and sees the vision of her son with Aragorn. Her determination to be with the latter is so strong that she went back to Rivendell. The music suits the scene so well.<br />The rest of the pieces are beautiful as well and I can't describe all cos it'll be super long. All I can say is that this soundtrack is a classic and will be one of those songs that will be familiar to you 10 years down the road.<BR>Kudos to Howard Shore. Amazing work of perfection.

B0000028RR|5.0|One of the best c.d.'s ive ever heard. It gets you going from the very beginning with &quot;bombtrack.&quot; So lets get into it.<BR>1.Bombtrack 9.0-Great song,simple as that.<BR>2.Killing In The Name 10.0-One of my fave all time Rage songs, and the ending with zack ripping out f*** you i wont do what you tell me just makes me wanna get up and push the radio over.<BR>3.Take The Power Back 8.5-Awesome song, and very political, as you can see by the title.<BR>4.Settle for Nothing 10.0-Amazing. It doesn't really sound like rage that much, it is kind of dark, subtle song until the &quot;chorus&quot; when zack screams like no other.<BR>5.Bullet In The Head 9.5-Another single, and deserving of it too. Great song especially when he screams again.<BR>6.Know Your Enemy 9.5-One of my fave songs on the album, just flat out kick.<BR>7.Wake Up 8.5-I first heard this while watching the matrix, and thought it was awesome and still do, but it doesn't have a rebellious feel to it until the end.<BR>8.Fistful of Steel 9.5-Tremendous!<BR>9.Township Rebellion 9.0-Great, I love the guitar work in this one as well as all the others.<BR>10.Freedom 10.0-What a great way to end a kick ass album. Another one of rage's best by far. <BR>Thanks I hope this helped you, buy the damn thing. You'll Love It!
B00005B36H|5.0|Once in a while, an album is produced that takes talent and technology and fuses them together in a product that is beyond compare.  Pink Floyd's Dark Side Of The Moon and Prodgy's Fat Of The Land are two good examples; there is no mistaking the genius of the writing, but the production so amplifies it that the final product is more than just the music and the lyrics.  Tool embodies this phenomenon, and as is the hallmark of true art, it is not for the faint at heart.  This is advanced-stage listening; it requires real musical understanding to grasp the brilliance of Danny Carey's drumming, the subtleties of Adam Jones' guitar, the mystery of Justin Chancellor's bass.  Maynard James Keenan's voice is how Tool (and Perfect Circle) becomes accessible to the masses numbed by the Hip-Hop Anti-Musical Revolution,  but it also ties together the most progressive and intelligent music written yet.  &quot;Schism&quot;, common on today's non-corporate radio station airwaves, is but a scratch of the surface.  &quot;Lateralis&quot; may feature the most brilliant ending written to date (just besting Boston's &quot;Don't Look Back&quot; in 1978), but for a real treat, examine the wordless &quot;Triad&quot; on track 12 (similarity: the penultimate song of Prodigy's masterpiece was &quot;Climbatize&quot;, also wordless).  This is an album meant to be experienced with eyes closed, earphones turned up loud, no distractions.  Music as the forefront of art, a shining example of why we turned to notes and rhythms in the first place, and what they can really do to our souls.
B000002J1S|5.0|I have been listening to this album for almost 3 years, and each time I listen to it, it gets better and better. When I first listened to it, I thought it was alright, but I knew it had potential to get better. In my opinion, it is the greatest concept album of all time, and possibly the best album period!!!
B00009Z576|5.0|Pay no mind to the first post that suggests this album isn't a Yes album save for a Roger Dean cover.  <br />If Mr. Chris Squire says it's Yes - and he's the only guy to have been in ALL lineups with the Yes name - then it's Yes.  And guess what, folks?  The album SOUNDS like Yes.  With Howe, Squire and White providing the base - gee, go figure!<br />&quot;Drama&quot; REALLY benefits from an infusion of youth in Geoff Downes, who brought fresh thinking and hi-tech keyboard gear and sounds to the band.  It was also nice to not have a Yes album with the refrigerator magnet lyrical musings of Jon Anderson.  Would I like to hear Jon sing the &quot;Drama&quot; material?  Yep, that'd be nice.  But, I don't have any problems with Mssr. Horn at the mic.<br />You'll get all sorts of styles here - heavy rock (well, for Yes anyway), moody passages, movie muisc (White Car), and more.  <br />For those who want to see how Asia evolved and, to a lesser extent, how Yes moved from the lumbering troupe of the late 70's to the lean machine heard on 90125, this is your album.  One of my all-time favorites.
0451191153|4.0|You might have heard people say, \\"The Fountainhead changed my life.\\" Its that kind of novel - it changes lives. After reading it, I saw things in a very different light. Objectivism is 'the' philosophy. Rand, however, should have conveyed her message solely through philosophical essays. Her novels are far from engrossing. The thing I disliked most about both The Fountainhead and Atlas Shrugged is that her characters lack depth. They are either black or white - never shades of gray. In The Fountainhead, Roark and Dominique are perfect, flawless and one can clearly see the flaws in Keating and Toohey. It would have been interesting to see how normal Americans would behave in Rand's world, however, normal people do not exist in her novels. One can argue that our notion of a 'normal American' is not the same as her's. After all, she wrote the book decades ago. For people who are interested in her philosophy, read Virtue of Selfishness, http://www.amazon.com...
B0000DD7LB|1.0|Is She kiddin me with this CD? Is this a joke? This is the most Pathetic Cd I have ever heard,I used to be  somewhat of a fan But Then This came out,Highly dissapointed.Just do me and yourself a favor DONT BUY THIS CD IT SUX Big Time.
B000127LW2|1.0|Voyager is without a doubt, the biggest turkey in the Star Trek universe. I hoped, like alot of other Star Trek fans, that Lameager would'nt be terrible. This series started off in poor shape and then got progressively worse, forcing the producers in the following seasons to throw in Jeri Ryan in tight fitting spacesuits and the Borg - at the same time! <br />   This DVD does contain alot of extra's, you could probably find out just went wrong with Voyager by watching all the extra features but I just don't care anymore.
B0000A02TZ|5.0|John Belushie from SNL delivers one of the best preformences ever i love this movie.
0451191153|4.0|The plot is much more compelling when read aloud by a chorus of seventeen chickens.  (Be sure you get the right version.)
B0000AQVCL|4.0|This album was a big suprise.  In a world filled with Hives, Strokes, and White Stripes...you wouldn't think a really good band sort of like that rying to revive old school rock and roll would come along and be really really good, but this one did.  This album is filled with catchy tracks reminicent of the Rolling Stones, Led Zepplin, and the Who.  <br />I would say, check them out before you throw them in the (those damn &quot;the&quot; bands (even though they aren't the) categorie.  These are some really good songs.  I gave it only four stars because the album is pretty short and there are maybe two tracks that don't really stand out.  But four is an &quot;excellent&quot; rating according to me (5 being perfect) and this is really truly excellent!  Throw away the icesty whie stripes and those poisonous hives and Get Born!
B00005OAIE|4.0|OK, I originally thought that John Mayer was a one note semi-talented singer-songwriter whose only claim to fame was formerly dating Jennifer Love Hewitt. After seeing him twice on Austin City Limits, I had to change my own negative opinion of him because he is a very talented musician.He has excellent vocal phrasings.His lyrics are easy to follow and the melodies are strongly crafted that I can't get his music out of my head (espcially,on &quot;Why Georgia&quot;).
B00008PC2O|4.0|this is by far the best in the series. its well acted and there are twists and turns to keep u interested in the story. its one of those few sequels that actually work. great action a amart plot and a few twists and turns makes this a must own
0806930152|2.0|I read one other review that was critical of this book.  I think most opinions are swayed by Bridgman's reputation. It is hard to agrue with his credentials. But for me this book lacks the clarity to help my students learn to draw the human form. The  sketches are interesting to look at in their own right, but the text is confusing and isn't tied to the visuals.  <BR>I feel there are other more helpful reference books such as &quot;Drawing the Human Anatomy&quot;, by Civardi. I still prefer my original anatomy book by Peck. <BR>At best this could be a good companion, but shouldn't be someone's first or only anatomy book.
B000002U82|5.0|I have listened to many CDs in my life but none have awe struck me as much as Dark Side of the Moon by Pink Floyd.<br />I just recently got the CD from my friend Dan.  Before I had it I only had two songs from them, Money and Time.  Both were equally good songs but I just wasn't really into it.  Then I got a few more PF songs and looked on Amazon at DSOTM and knew I needed it.  Once I got it from dan, I stuck it on my computer and then listened and was awestruck.  It was amazing.  As cheezy as it may sound, it took me to a place I didn't think I'd ever go.  Before with just those two songs, it was ok.  Once I had it all back to back with everything else, it was an experience.  The lyrics were genius and the music is just beyond words.  Seriously.  I had heard raving of this CD but I didn't expect it to now be my favorite CD ever.  This CD then got me into Pink Floyd and now I am a big fan of theirs!  This is a must buy!  Below are how I rate the tracks<br />1. Speak to Me/Breathe- An amazing intro, definitely something fresh and new.  It starts with lots of talking from all over and then goes into Breathe which is cool  As short as it is, I really like it.  9/10<BR>2. On the Run- No lyrics or anything, just a lot of experimental sound.  An ok song.  7/10<BR>3. Time- My favorite song on the CD.  A great song about realizing your life is precious and time is ticking.  Great lyrics and great music all around.  10/10<BR>4. Great gig in the sky- My least favorite song on the CD.  It is basically just some singing done by a woman.  I usually always skip it.  5/10<BR>5. Money- Another great song that I've bet you heard on the radio.  Fun to listen to and a cool solo in it.  One of the best songs on the CD. 9/10<BR>6. Us and Them- A very nice but slow song.  Very power song.  8.5/10<BR>7. Any color you like- I really like this song too, even though it is an instrumental, it has great synths and definitely is trippy.  9/10<BR>8. Brain Damage- Another awesome song.  Cool lyrics and I like the music in it too.  8.9/10<BR>9. And now the last song, my 2nd favorite song on the CD.  It is very epic and the perfect way to end my favorite and probably one of the best CDs ever!  9.9/10<br />This CD is brilliant and if you haven't heard it already, by all means listen to it!  It is just one of those thing you just can't miss out on.  It has a lot of lessons in it and is just amazing.  Even though some of the songs I did give some low scores to, they all help the flow of the album and in the end aren't really so bad at all!  Overall I'd give this CD a 10/10!
B00007LL7O|4.0|When I first picked this release up (actually my first Stratovarius album) I played it and was blown away by Eagleheart.  I loved that song.  Then Soul of a Vagabond, Find Your Own Voice, and Fantasia were really good.  Then the rest of it didn't really stand out to me very much and I was a little dissapointed.  Well, I went a long time not really listening to the whole album, really just those select few songs.  But recently I gave the whole thing another chance.  And my ears have been opened a new.  I think it's a really solid album.  There are some light tracks like Papillion and a Drop in the Ocean that I do really kind of like now, that I wasn't too impressed with back in the day.  <br />Really, now there are a few things I still don't like about it, not really huge problems that would stop me from making any other Stratovarius purchases.  The lyricist seems to like to jam the &quot;I don't believe in god, I believe iin myself and only myself&quot; crap down our throats.  It's ok to have those beliefs and even write some tunes about it, but it's really a bit too much at times.  Please expand your lyrical horizons!  And i'm not too impressed with the really light interlude in Fantasia.  It seems a little out of place, then the mood completely changes with no transition from what sounds like a balad to an early metallica thrash-fest!  Without any sort of transtition!  <br />Well...those small beefs aside, this is a really solid somewhat lighter power metal album that may need a few listens to fully love and appreciate.
B000078DOI|5.0|When I started playing guitar in 1987, I pigeon-holed myself into one playing one type of music or the other. When I first heard this album, I didn't understand it. After 2 days of making myself listen to it, my musical interests expanded ten-fold and by the end of the week, I was listening to everything I could get my hands on. This album helped me explore music as a whole instead of categorically eliminating entire genres of music just because they weren't easily accessible. This album really got me into funk, hard rock, and general weirdness. My album collection expanded to include everything from ABBA to Frank Zappa. I can honestly say that because of Mother's Milk, I am more of a well-rounded musician today instead of a three chord chugging moron. This album introduced me to John Frusciante, and my guitar playing went from being a hobby to a passion. Thanks, John!<BR>If you already own the original version of Mother's Milk, it is not a necessity to own this (the extra tracks don't make it any better or any less incredible), but I gave it five stars because to give it less would be criminal.
B00005JM0B|3.0|good but its the worst of the three. if ur a fan of this series youll be pleasently surprized by this. it keeps the series alive and ill be waiting for the 4th. 3 and a half stars
B000069AUI|5.0|Cold Play resists the temptation to be all things to all people in this CD, opting instead for a unique sound.  To all those groups that have to force an evocative response, typically signaled by the electric blur of the lead guitar as if to say &quot;here's the part where you're really supposed to feel moved,&quot;  Cold Play consistently manages to move the listener to new dimensions through its artful use of every element in its arsenal.  The piano's smooth weave, the occassional falsetto in the vocals, drums that find their groove..this is a sophisticated sound. A hypnotic work. A Rush lures you in and takes hold, gripping your focus as only fine art across the spectrum of arts is capable of doing.
B00007GZR5|5.0|This movie is like none other.  It's more of a work of art than a movie.  Like many great works of art, the meaning is often left up to the viewer.  What's really important here is how the visual aspect of the film makes you feel.  The storyline is secondary, and for good reason.  It's hard to follow for one, what with the timeline jumping back and forth.  For another, it's a journey into the arena of faith and theology with barely a mention of God.  It's basically a hodgepodge of new age/reincarnation belief, psychobabble, and ultraromanticism.  I consider the storyline nothing more than a tool to explore the possibilities of modern technology in moviemaking.  In this regard this movie excels.  An incredibly vivid imagination and adventurist spirit on the part of those who created this movie brought it from a 20 year old script to the finished product - a cinematic impressionist masterpiece.  (Much of the artwork was actually taken from the works of Van Gogh and Monet.)  This and the additional features provided on the DVD (an excellent mini-documentary on the making of the movie plus a couple of trailers and bios of castmembers and more) give it 5 stars.  If you can actually get anything out of the story that's a bonus.
B000002MTR|1.0|I find it interesting that more people reviewed this album than some of the RHCP's other albums. Maybe because pretty boy Navarro took his head out of his rear end long enough to play guitar on it...but I digress. 4 words...&quot;No John? No Way.&quot;
B0000BWVCM|4.0|this is one of the best hero movies ever made. watch it and then watch it again. its smart its witty and the characters are very likable good action make this a great super hero movie see and own it
B000002UJQ|5.0|Let me start by saying that my favorite genres are hiphop, soul, R&amp;B, jazz, funk, gospel. I hate contemporary rock, which mostly sounds like a bunch of bourgeois white boys lamenting about how their pampered life sucks. Never liked Nirvana, or any other &quot;progressive rock&quot; bands. I scoffed when I heard my friends playing Radiohead years back. But it grew on me fast.<br />I've listened to OK Computer countless times, and it's a masterpiece, whether you're into the genre or not. Although some of the lyrics strike a chord with me, by and far most of the words on the tracks fly over my head, consistent with its airy and out-worldly vibe. Sounds like it's trying to be Avant Garde for the sake of being Avant Garde at times.<br />That all doesn't matter when listening to the musical prowess that the band manifests. Radiohead somehow combines grating dissonant sounds into impassioned crescendos that all come together, resolving into a harmony that can only be described as genuis. Distortion guitars and high-pitched sounds characteristic of rock bands these days can drive one up the wall, but Radiohead masterfully fits it all together into tracks that are both melodic and engaging. It still baffles me how such individually unpalatable sounds can sound so good.<br />The stroke of genius doesn't stop at one or two radio-friendly tracks, as a lot of pop bands do with albums (make a hit single, make 10 filler songs). The whole album is great, and tracks seem to naturally progress in a way that you can feel shortchanged if you don't listen to the whole album through each time.<br />Their later albums are just uncomprehendable (Kid A, Hail to the Thief) to me, but after years of listening to this album, I still can regularly put on OK Computer. It ecclectically sits next to my collection of Isley Brothers, D'Angelo, Coltrane and Erkah Badu, testament to the talent that can be appreciated by anyone who appreciates music.
0345409671|5.0|I am not a fan of Anne Rice, I never followed the vampire stories or whatever, but somehow I got my hands on this book and I was completely blown away. This book is basically the authors' interpretation of Western religion. If you are looking for some kind of vampire story then you will be dissapointed. But if you are looking for a unique view of God and the Devil - then read this book today! The book is FICTION people and no one is claiming anything to the contrary. Enjoy the book to that end.
B000007MVM|4.0|It's a shame that more people don't know who this man is. He started one of the biggest rock and roll franchises of the seventies, and even today he is revered in circles of musicians that are educated on the history of Pink Floyd. This album shows his songcrafting abilities and his undeniable guitar skills. Even under a haze of LSD, the man can deliver a song as good as anything that was on the radio back in the day, but his reputation preceded him and his music remains in obscurity. <BR>This isn't a Pink Floyd album. It's full of little ditties about being lost in the woods, girls that don't like his songs, and dresses. The whole album has a &quot;sit right here, I'm gonna play you a song&quot; vibe to it, and the lack of a dedicated backing band makes it almost folky...but those are the qualities that I like about it. It's a little disjointed at times, but an unpolished gem is still a gem.
B00005N5S5|4.0|this is a sci fi gem. it is a master peice amoung movies. it is smart and it has good action. if ur looking for a good action flick check it out if ur looking for a good sci fi flick check it out. watch it and then watch it again
B0001ADB8C|5.0|Aloha everyone!<BR>I got the box set today!! and I just wanted to say a big THANKS to the people who put it together - it totally rocks! I've been a Beatles fan for awhile, and this is my new prized possession. Not only does it include all 6 of the original Harrison Albums from the Dark Horse Years (now re-mastered and with previously unreleased tracks!) but there are also a bunch of new pics here that I've never seen anywhere before AND lots of bonus/previously<BR>unreleased music!! I rate this package very highly... it really is something special, and you all need to go get it now!!<br />Enjoy....<br />Pete
B00000JGOJ|3.0|This movie definitely has a lot of firepower in terms of its stars, the plot lines are interesting, and the characters are appealing.  That said, because of the five separate story lines and the two hour running time, the amount of focus limited how much any one relationship could be developed.  A good movie for romantics who don't mind a few tears!
B000002LQR|5.0|Absolutely one of the top five albums of the nineties. This record stood firm against the rising tide of &quot;grunge&quot; music in the early nineties and launched the band to mega-stardom. The music breathes in such an organic way that it almost seems like the music was playing them instead of them playing the music. This is one of the only albums that I can continuously listen to from beginning to end for days at a time. It cemented John's spot as an iconic guitar player, raising the bar for many musicians, myself included. This is a masterpiece by every definition of the word, and I'm glad that I was around to witness the magic of these four guys creating music together. Don't miss out on this experience.
B00005JKC3|4.0|the hulk is great it has great acting spectacular acting but it may be a little to smart for it own good. theres scenes in the movie were it seems as the characters are qoteing shakspere ( dont kno if i spelled that right) and eric bannas performance seems to be every were but besides that the hulk is great and is good enough for a low 4

B000088E6D|5.0|I first heard this guy's voice on the Down With Love CD after I starting liking the song \\"Kissing a Fool.\\" I found out it was Michael Buble, and I ordered the CD.    After a week of listening to it in the car, I was able to sing with every song.    Fever - While listening to this song you can just imagine him sneering at you speaking about the fever. The whole song seems seductive and is fun to listen to and play for friends.    Moondance - This one isn't the most powerful, but it's fun to listen to nonetheless.    Kissing a Fool - This song is awesome! I first heard it on the Down With Love CD, and it's the reason for buying this CD. Its slower tempo is really moving. It's one of the best on the CD.    For Once in my Life - I really enjoy the big band in this one. It's another fun song.    How Can You Mend a Broken Heart - This selection is definitely one of the best on the CD. Someone before mentioned that it was silly and ungenuine. I think Buble does a remarkble job singing this song. I listen to it all the time. There's just something about it that puts me in a good mood.    Summer Wind - I'm not a fan of this song - it just seems boring.    You'll Never Find Another Love - This one sort of flows and puts you in a good mood. The backup singing adds a lot to its flowing characteristics.    Crazy Little Thing Called Love - I do like this song, but I reburned the CD without it. Why? There is an ANNOYING bell that plays in the background. It makes it almost unbearable to listen to.    Put Your Head on my Shoulder - This song is great! It flows and just puts you in a good mood.    Sway - This song is a lot of fun. I can listen to this over and over. It just makes you want to sing along with it. I love what Buble does with his voice in it. One of the best!    The Way You Look Tonight - This is another one of the flowing songs. It's a little boring, but it's not the worst.    Come Fly With Me - I really like this one. His voice is so awesome in it. I love the band inthe background. Good song!    That's All - What a good ending to the CD! It's got a nice piano playing in the background that just seems so relaxing.    Overall, this CD gets an A+ from me. I have owned it for several months, and I am still not tired of it. I listen to it all the time. Michael Buble is one of those up-and-coming singers whose voice is truly captivating and remarkable. I strongly recommend this CD for the car/office!
B00005J6UP|5.0|Excellent transfer quality, and the soundtrack is far better sounding than the VHS version.  <br />The extras on this disc are average, and the deleted scenes are a good indicator that the theatrical edit of this film was well done.  Spielberg's script is definitely one of his better efforts for the period.  Five stars for keeping the action clean and well aimed at a younger audience.<br />A good lighthearted adventure for the kid in all of us.
B00005JLXE|3.0|this a step down from x men and spider man but its still good. tis could have been ten time as more better if they have had added about 20 minutes but for now this will do. good fun super hero fun
B00008OWZC|5.0|Only the best are remembered 22 years after their breakup. Led Zeppelin is shown at their best in these CDs. You can feel the energy, and hear the passion of the playing. The band was turely amazing. The entire CD collection is one big masterpiece. Well, you put a band like Led Zepppelin on stage, the masterpiece kindof writes itself. To the calm finger picking of 'Going to California', to the thick bluesy feel of 'Bring it on Home' and to the high energy wailing guitar solo in 'Immigrant Song', and the thunderous drum solo in 'Moby Dick' this CD is the best I have in my colleciton, hands down. Do you like Zeppelin? Thinking you like zeppelin? Bored? BUY THIS CD SET! Also buy the DVD
B000001GAM|5.0|Lush, dramatic, well phrased, amazing sense of structure. This is one of my very favorite performances of this symphony. The orchestra is amazing, and Giulini does such a great job in bringing out the inner voices -- terrific first movement, terrific second movement, terrific third movement!
B00005IC2H|5.0|Excellent album with Sigur Rós, they really are the best and most original group around today. <br />To set things straight, the only song on this record in &quot;Hopelandic&quot; is Olsen Olsen.. The rest is in Icelandic.<BR>You can find the lyrics at [...]<br />Peace !!
B00005JMJ4|5.0|This is a truely memorable movie.<br />There seems to be some talk about it being racist against japanese. <br />I would take fault with that... its not about American/English superiority over Japanese, its about the incredible feeling of lonelyness you feel when you're thrust into another culture, for purposes other then pleasure. If anyone has been on a work trip to Mexico, France, Japan or Germany, or if you're not from an English country, taking a business trip to the USA is the same. <br />The scenes with the shower, the evelvator, the directors ... these scenes to me don't laugh at being japanese, they're about how these differences are obsticals that Bob just doesn't have the energy to deal with.<br />When you're on business in another culture, there's just nothing to do when you're just too tired from work to handle the translation, miss-communication or even the TV that you can't understand, the Radio that only plays a few songs you know. If you want to try to feel like it, go home tonight and after the long drive, turn on a TV channel you can't understand, find youself a magazine that's not in your language, sit by yourself on the bed, doing/reading/listening/watching nothing, see how long you last. For myself and people I know, you end up staying entirely in the hotel bar talking to the only waiter that speaks english. <br />This movie shows that the only time Bob and Charlotte ever get to enjoy being in Japan is when they're together. When they have someone to joke with (even share the bad dirty joke), to play with and to talk with. Its only then can you deal with bridging the communication gap. The scenes with their night out in Tokyo together show this perfectly. Just having someone to go back to, share what you've learned, talk about what was weird, what was great, that is what's important. <br />This is a movie about context, its about how powerful cultural context can be, how much we desire to be with someone, anyone that we can relate to. <br />Finally, this is also a movie about the agony boredom, so be be surprised if there's some boring bits.
B00008972S|5.0|This movie is the best movie I've ever seen!  It's my absolute favorite movie ever in the history of the world!  I've seen it over 6 times, and I never get tired of it!  All those who think it's a bad movie are crazy!  It's a classic and it rocks!  I don't think I'll ever get tired of watching it.  Okay, some of the music and choriography is a little corny, but the story is one of a kind!  It's awesome!  I LOVE IT!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
B000127LW2|4.0|I've been looking forward to this DVD set for years.  The Voyager series is my second favorite after the Original series.  All of the Star Trek DVD's have been a little high priced compared to other series and DVD packages with a few exceptions....the Special Editions of the Star Trek movies were a pleasant surprise.  I noticed on Amazon's details section for this set it never did mention how many disks were included....only the small number of episodes 16....(compared to other TV series).  Well after a trip to Wal-Mart the answer is 5-disks for $98 plus tax.  A price of $75 for the smaller number of disks would have been fair.  I will wait for the first season to drop in price before I buy.  I certainly hope the later seasons are not even more expensive for the additional number of disks.  The artwork on the back of the first set shows the other six seasons with probably 7 disks apiece.  Thanks to Amazon for beating Wal-Mart's price but still too high for now.

0385510438|3.0|The 1st part of this book is really good, good characters, murder, mystery, legal courtroom drama and journalism. The 2nd part was not very interesting to me, although the ending was good. Looks like Grisham is giving us a 1/2 legal(Runaway Jury) and 1/2  human interest(Painted House) story. Overall an enjoyable read for me. I prefer the author's legal thrillers.
B000000WA4|5.0|This was one of the first albums I ever bought, so it's very special to me. I originally bought this on double-cassette in late '95, and me being the short-attention-spanned 15 year old I was, immediately fast-forwarded through everything until I got to the songs I was already familiar with. I had no idea most of the songs I had always skipped were so good until I listened to the rest six months later. After having listened to everything, there ARE some songs I don't care for after all these years, though. To me, a lot of Mellon Collie is dull, especially both ends of Side B. Yeah, the songs could've been cut down to fit one tape or disc, but then nobody would've been happy at all. Whether you like the soft and mushy side of the Pumpkins with songs like Beautiful and Cupid de locke, or hard &amp; heavy like Zero and Bodies, everyone will be satisfied; just skip over the songs you don't like. Apparently, more than a few people have an issue with having to press the 'change track' button to get to the songs they prefer, and this makes me wonder how these people even hauled their lazy arses down to the CD Barn to get Mellon Collie... or even work to get the money to purchase the album for that matter. Somebody needs to confiscate your CD player along with all your beer and pot, and never give it back. You don't even deserve Mellon Collie if you can't muster the energy to press a button every seven minutes. See what listening to Nirvana does to you? It makes all of you lazy sods that can't think or do for themselves. I give Mellon Collie Five outta Five because the songs I do love on the tapes are that good. Adore is a great follow-up too. I see DM had made their mark on Billy after they toured.
B000092Q4U|5.0|This cd is just brutle. From start to Finish.<BR>track numbers 5 and ten are the best of the them all <BR>track 4 and track 1 are my other favourites.
B00007FOMP|5.0|This is not &quot;merely&quot; a great album - it's the best album of all time! When all the wise foolish critics get together and scribe out their &quot;best of&quot; lists, this is where they (and everyone else) must start. Marvin Gaye was a phenomenally talented singer with a long history of family strife, addiction, abuse and even laziness, self-doubt and procrastination. He had tasted success previously (most notably with &quot;I heard it through the grapevine&quot;) and not only was a member of the famous Motown stable, but he  married in to the Gordy family (yeah, how inscure was he anyways?). But this album immediately put him in a class by himself, beyond reach of the Stones and Beatles and Beach Boys of the pop world and the Aretha Franklin's and Otis Reddings and Stevie Wonders from the soul/R&amp;B side. Did he know what he was doing or was it a happy accident? No one will know for sure, except that this suite of songs changed forever what music would be and shattered people's expectations of what an album could be. The topics aren't fluffy and cute (Sergeant Pepper) or ultimately useless (Who's Next), but they hit hard and home. Poverty? Drug addiction? Government Spending (or overspending, to be more specific)? Child abuse? Religious confusion? It's all there.<br />Any artist coming out with a release after 1971 knew in the back of their mind that they would forever be compared with the bench mark of &quot;What's Going On&quot;. If you're Milli Vanilli and out to make money, great. If you're Smashing Pumpkins and you want to be a critical smash (in addition to the money), great. Whatever and whoever you are, you're going to be measured by this album. It's almost comical (tragicomical) when artists such as Whitney Houston will have the audacity to compare their work with this one. Can you really call any single album number one? No and yes. No, you can only group them with a top 20 of best works, and yes, there is one exception: &quot;What's Going On&quot;.<br />The problem with topical is you can only go so far with it: we are forever a world of indulgence, and that said, we need music, nice hummable melodies that if possible fill our souls with emotions. The end result of lyrics, melodies, performances and productions should be that they take you another, better place. This is exactly what &quot;What's Going On&quot; accomplishes. To pin a historical analogy on it, when you listen to &quot;what's Going On&quot;, consumers can finally have their cake and eat it too.
0385335482|4.0|Sophie Kinsella's 'Confessions of a Shopaholic' is truly a refreshing, entertaining and light-hearted read. The main character Rebecca (Becky) Bloomwood is a 25 year old financial journalist who is in debt because of her frivoulous spending habits. The way Becky gets herself into deeper debt and more trouble is what makes this book so funny. I found that I could not put the book down because I just HAD to see how she was going to get herself out of the sticky situations she managed to get herself in. At times I would get annoyed with some things that Becky did, but I just couldn't stay mad at her. She is like a zany best friend. Her thoughts and the way she  plotted things out were so comical, I found myself literally laughing out loud. This book truly kept my interest throughout. The farther you get into the book, the crazier the circumstances and the louder the laughs. I definatly recommend this book to anyone who is looking for a fun and light read. Thumbs up to Ms. Kinsella!
B00018TI5E|5.0|John Frusciante proves himself as one of the greatest musicians of our generation with this amazing album. I saw RHCP twice last year in concert (Grand Rapids and Detroit, MI) and was so seduced by Frusciante's solo song \\"Maybe\\" (sorry 'A music fan from Phoenix, AZ'), that I marked this day on my calendar a long time ago. I also bought the Slane Castle DVD, just to see that performance, but that one song does no justice to show John's complexity and incredible overall musicianship as this cd does. His incredible guitar ability and unigue use of effects combined with very dark, seductive lyrics combine to make my best purchase in over a year. If you are an RHCP fan, better yet, a music fan in general, I highly suggest this cd, you will not be dissatisfied.
B00008OLYN|5.0|Damnation is a big change in what ,you would normally hear from them,but this cd shows how talented these guys really are.It is very calming to listen to when you are on a road trip (just listen to the cd while looking at the scenery go by). The sound over all is phenominal. The band could have added a couple more to the cd to make it a little longer,overall it is a great buy.

B00005JMJ4|4.0|Man, another movie that leaves audiences completely divided. Well, I had wanted to see this from the get-go, and though a friend (whose opinion I normally trust) said it didn't live up to his expectations, I personally disagree. <br />It is possible that if you've never immersed yourself in another culture, then you might dislike this film for a variety of reasons; you might have the knee-jerk reaction \\"well, I never wanna go to Japan!\\", but Lost In Translation is not a travel guide for the casual tourist. The characters in the movies are not tourists either. Bill Murray's Bob Harris is in Tokyo to do a TV commercial, and Scarlett Johansson's Charlotte is along for the ride with her working photographer hubby (played by Giovanni Ribisi). These two people are \\"lost\\" and confused in a world that they didn't choose to discover, so don't expect the camera to focus on the aspects of Japanese culture and history that might actually fascinate you. <br />So, we've got Bill Murray - another excellent understated performance (restrained in the same way as his role was in RUSHMORE) - and Scarlett Johansson (who I liked in the otherwise boring HORSE WHISPERER), and they meet in a hotel bar and develop an affinity for one another. Though it's a matter of interpretation, I don't think a romantic relationship really does or is supposed to develop between the two, still, if you are so inclined you can read into their interactions in whatever way you want. I've been the foreigner on many an occasion in another country/culture, and I can confirm that in moments of boredom and perhaps confusion it was a relief meeting a person who was in the same boat as me. Does that mean I have to fall in love and sleep with them just because they can relate to my situation? Come on, that's silly.  <br />I liked the acting, the look, the subtlety of details, and I liked the humour - which doesn't manifest itself in the usual Hollywood Ha-Ha kind of way. Also, the humour is not constant; the latter part of the movie is not nearly as amusing as the classic Murray reactionary humour of the first half, so please, don't expect the \\"Best Comedy of the Year\\". It's not that kind of movie. <br />I read a lot of reviews when the movie was released of people who struggled with the ending calling it 'sad', 'cheap', 'inappropriate', 'unfulfilling' etc. Hmm. I don't know what they were expecting. Let's just say there is no real 'ending' in the traditional movie sense. The final exchange between Bob and Charlotte is left open-ended. I, for one, thought it was the perfect ending. Anything more dramatic would have felt out of place. And besides, I was able to fill in the blanks myself. It's nice when movies let the audience do that. <br />Still, despite all my good feelings towards Lost in Translation, there are flaws. Some people liked the music, but there were several moments in my mind, where that damn music gets spread on too thick. Soft and tinkly one minute, loud and annoying the next. What are we trying to communicate here? Any thing at all? The other thing is that Sofia Coppola (the director) lets the camera linger a wee bit too long on some shots. How many times do we have to see Charlotte sitting on her 100th floor high windowsill overlooking the city? We get the picture. <br />Anyway, it's got some flaws, and it's easy to point them out when - as a viewer - you're so used to being given a certain amount of information either visually or verbally. Well, Lost in Translation doesn't fill in all the gaps for you. But it's worth a rental (I bought it), because it doesn't do things by the book, which is a good thing, and lest I forget, Bill Murray and Scarlett Johansson are excellent.
B00003CXB4|5.0|This DVD is really a true classic and a must-have for all Disney fans.
B00005JLWN|5.0|I was tempted not to watch this because of all the &quot;If you enjoyed the Matrix, you'll love this!&quot; hype it received. I overlooked that, and watched it and I really enjoyed it. For the budget they had (20 Mil) and the short amount of time to film it, it stands up as a good film, and an even better film if you do not compare it to other films and enjoy it for what it is. I do feel the end was as climatic as it could have been, and there were a few plot holes, but over all I would watch it again.
B00004WG2F|5.0|I love this movie its a wonderful love story, you can watch with your boyfriend, and he'll actually like it!It has just enough action in it and plenty of romance. If you can get it in the Target store its a few dollars cheaper            BUY IT ITS GREAT
B00018D44U|5.0|I have to disagree with the negatories here. This is an astonishing record. It made me go back and listen more closely to her first album, which I now also marvel at. She puts it all into her songs, all the way through. Her joy with this music is supported so beautifully by the musicians and producers. From the first to the second album, you can hear how much she's learned about her own voice, and now it's shining brightly here. Also, the country or Texas flavor was always there, if you go back to the first LP. It's something that makes her distinctive, this very original blend of jazz, Texas &quot;roots&quot; music, cocktail bar lounge torch song, you name it. I just hope she can hang on to her muse through the insanity ahead, with all the platinum album pressure. Maybe Dolly Parton, Levon Helm, and Garth Hudson can be guardian angels for her through the cruelties of fame and fortune in the music business. They sure sound sweet on her album! Norah, just keep doin what your doin.

0345446798|5.0|A very good read ...<br />The book starts with the premise that people who love dogs have desire to understand dogs ... And McConnell's book guides us down this very special journey without cloying sentimentality but always with heart and kindness ... <br />A dog behaviour book that goes beyond just reciting basic concepts of dominance, leadership within a pack ... and beyond basic operant, praise &amp; treat methods ... McConnell explores and explains the subtleties of dog nature and human nature ... how our 2 species interract and react one with the other ... the building blocks for better understanding between man and dog ...<br />The author explains why dogs do what they do, and just as important, she explains why we behave the way we do ... and how our very differences, both enrich and causes conflict in our relationships with our canine friends ...<br />The chapter titles are descriptive of the author's beliefs ... 'Translating Primate to Canine' ... 'Pack Mates' ... 'The Truth About Dominance' ... 'Patient Dogs and Wise Humans' ...<br />The author's thoughts are clear and easy to follow ... her words a pleasure to read ...<br />While this book is not a training manual, it will compliment any training manual ... filling the bare bones of training with an appreciation &amp; understanding of how and why training methods work (or don't work) and teaches when and how to modify training methods to suit both dog &amp; owner ...<br />Definitely worth a read ...
B00005JMJ4|5.0|I absolutely adore this film.  When I saw &quot;lost in translation&quot; in the theaters a few months back, I couldn't believe the transformation of funnyman Bill Murray into a serious, middle aged man.  The part could not have been played better, or by anyone else.  The story of the film is quite simple, a man (murray) travels over to japan to shoot a couple vodka commericals in hopes of making a decent dollar.  He's married, and yet unsatisfied and doesn't know where to turn.  Enter scarlet johannson, who plays a newleywed that has the same feelings over her own marriage.  Her husband is too transfixed in his photography career that they hardly spend much time together.  It is only a matter of time before the two souls meet and begin to converse on how they are standing.<br />Really a beautiful film, and astonishing to note that it took just under 4 weeks to film.  Sophia Coppola really displayed an amazing effort, directing, writing, and I believe producing the film.  There is no doubt this film belongs in my top 10 favorites, if not the top 5.  Hey, I'm a nice man, maybe I can sneak it into my top 3.  You would have no idea what you are missing if you calmly skip over this film.  The character development is astonishing, the characters know when to be serious, know when comic relief is sorely needed.  One of the few films of 2003 that will leave you with a smile.
038572179X|2.0|This is yet another one of those prize-winning novels selected for discussion by my book group that I probably wouldn't have read on my own (cf. Soul Mountain, Possession, et al). And once again, I fail to be entranced by what seems to drive everyone else bonkers with reading delight. The caveat to this is that it turns out that I read the book with a very different perspective from my fellow book group members. You see, there's a bit of authorial slight of hand at work, and if you notice what's going on, everything in the book takes on a different shade altogether. Now, I wasn't actively looking for any such thing, but I picked up on a few clues (maybe 'cause I read a lot of detective stories?) and made a few assumptions, which ended up being correct in the end. This is in contrast to the seven other people I discussed the book with, who were floored (and delighted) by a revelation made about 2/3 of the way into it.<br />In any event, the story starts in mid-1930s England in the home of a wealthy landed family. The first third slowly sets up a scenario of the prodigal son returning for the weekend. This is a very controlled and precisely structured bit of very old-fashioned writing which feels highly artificial until the weekend starts to unravel when a crude love note gets into the wrong hands. Emotions start to run high and then a terrible crime is committed, creating a moral ambiguity that the rest of the novel revolves around. In the next section we meet one of the characters in the fields of France several years later, as he struggles with two other soldiers to make it to Dunkirk for the great evacuation. This slender section is quite evocative and quite different from those bookending it. The third section takes the reader back across the channel to Blitz-era London, where several other characters from the country weekend train to be nurses. However, amidst all the action (such as it is), the characters all exist in the shadow of that awful weekend, and operate in service of the much larger theme named by the title.<br />This central question is posed by one the characters: &quot;How can a novelist achieve atonement when, with her absolute power of deciding outcomes, she is also God?&quot; Well, this is the point at which you will either laud McEwan for cleverness and precision of plotting that reveal layers within the story, or you will sigh at McEwan for playing too many games with his work in an attempt to present Deep Thoughts. While I can admire McEwan's precise control of style and voice, which he maintains throughout, and the elaborate construction of layers to the book, I certainly wasn't entranced by the central theme or how it propelled the interaction between characters. Perhaps had I read the story without &quot;getting&quot; what McEwan was up to from the start, I would have enjoyed it more, but I didn't. It doesn't help matters that the characters mostly remain period ciphers of the repressed variety, the kind that the comedian Eddie Izzard is so good at spoofing. Finally, the pace... is... glacial-one of the slowest books to unravel I've ever read. All in all, not a book I'd recommend to friends.te in service of the much larger theme named by the title.<br />This central question is posed by one the characters: &quot;How can a novelist achieve atonement when, with her absolute power of deciding outcomes, she is also God?&quot; Well, this is the point at which you will either laud McEwan for cleverness and precision of plotting that reveal layers within the story, or you will sigh at McEwan for playing too many games with his work in an attempt to present Deep Thoughts.

0385504209|1.0|Well, I just couldn't go on with this book.  I figured the author had some anti-Christian leanings when he mentioned how the church killed some five million 'witches' way back when - which is, I'm pretty sure, way off.  But, the book already had my interest, so I just thought I would enjoy the rest of it for entertainment's sake.<br />But when, just over half way through the book, I was expected to swallow that the divinity of Christ was never part of the early church's beliefs, but was invented by Constantine, four centuries after Christ, for purely political reasons, I felt sick.  Oh, yes, he had the Councel of Nicea convene, canonize the Bible according to his wishes (leaving out all those other books - 58 other gospels, no less - that proved Jesus was just a man).  Oh, they also decided to make Jesus God at this convention.  Constantine needed this, you see, for population manipulation purposes, of course - and this forms the foundation of Christianity today.  &quot;You mean the divinity of Christ was decided on by a vote?&quot; -&quot;Yes, and a very close vote at that&quot;, the scholarly characters of the book ensure us.  The dizzied woman gives the trusted scholar a look of shocked wonder. He replies with a gental nod on confirmation.  It's Puke-O-Rama time, everybody!<br />Okay, at this point I can see the author is basically making an attempt to debunk and discredit Christianity - the whole point of the book.  I felt violated.  He could have at least have shown some respect for historical facts.  You think he would have figured that some people, believers and non-believers alike, have actually looked these things up.
B00005LMBK|5.0|I like the variation.  Some people may want an entire CD full of &quot;Clint Eastwood&quot; songs, but they have other styles.  The song &quot;Re-hash&quot; is an addicting one.  The variety keeps you awake at night.<br />But in short, if you want other songs like Clint Eastwood, the only Clint Eastwood is Clint Eastwood.
B00018D44U|5.0|I had loved the album, &quot;Come Away With Me&quot;, and so rushed to buy &quot;Feels Like Home&quot;. It has been worth every penny I spent, and more.<BR>Warning: it is very different from &quot;Come Away .. &quot;. Initially I thought my expectations were let down, but then I realized that I could not stop listening to it. The songs kind of grow on you. Norah's voice, always unmistakable, sounds even better now .. has matured more. The songs are some romantic, some soulful, some a bit naughty and some full of zest. My personal favorites include Sunrise, So What Am I..?, Creeping In, Humble Me.<br />I would strongly recommend that anyone with any decent taste in music, buy and listen to this. Of course, it helps if you are  inclined towards Jazz/Blues/Country.<br />buy
B00013PHGS|5.0|Sure, 10,000 Hz Legend had a couple really good tunes on it, but who can really say they weren't a little disappointed with it? Not to worry, though, because this album marks a return to form for AiR. This is what we were all waiting for after the mesmerizing Moon Safari blew us away back in '97. Rather than sacrificing the integrity of their songs in the name of experimenting, Nicolas Godin and Jean-Benoit Dunckel stick to their guns on Talkie Walkie and deliver a superb, hypnotic album with nary a weak moment. And I just gotta say, I'm lovin' the banjo. Produced by Nigel Godrich, best known for his work with, ahem, Radiohead.
B0000DC151|4.0|The utter dissappointment here is merely the 8 little episodes, vs. the classic 12 or 13 of seasons past. I liked this season a lot!
6305696071|5.0|Does this movie glorify being a hooker? That's what Roseanne thinks. But who cares what she thinks anyway! This is a great movie, and even though it does kinda sorta glorify being a hooker (with the hopes of falling in love with a rich guy), you can pretty much say that every movie glorfies something that shouldn't be glorified.<br />Julia plays Vivianne, a relatively inexperienced hooker. Right away she meets Edward (Gere), who is rather coy around Vivianne, but invites her up to his room anyway. This leads to a week long agreement that she will be his arm piece for social functions and at the end of the week, she'll get $3,000 big ones. <br />She has rules to avoid attachment, but can Vivianne resist this hunky rich guy who (even though he says he isn't) is sweeping her off her feet? <br />This movie is truly wonderful. Roberts innocence shines through her character. There are lots of great one-liners in this movie, some true laugh out loud moments. Don't let the premise scare you away... it's much tamer and sweeter than alot of people make it out to be. So see this movie. It's cute, funny, sweet, and genuine-- a combination that's hard to find in any movie.

B00013F35I|4.0|The 1st disc was great.  I tried to play the 2nd disc but the disc would not respond to my remote.  I couldn't get to the documentary or individual performances.  I tried other dvd's and they all worked fine.  The 1st disc was fine too!  Thinking this was maybe a defect, I exchanged it....the same thing happened! I am so looking forward to seeing the 2nd disc.  Suggestions?  3 years later:  Weeks after writing this review I found out Sony was aware of the problem and they exchanged the one disc for me..it was a quick and seamless interaction.  It just took me this long to getting around to update the review.    Great concert!
B000127LW2|1.0|Who designed the package box? Naomi Wildman???<br />The TNG DVD sets were great and included nice pictures, a booklet, and a sweet fold out cardboard box. Very classy and very well worth the $100 a pop.<br />DS9's DVD set was a let down from the superior TNG pakaging, but still included pics and an episode timeline. Not to mention the DVDs, themselves, had pictures printed on them.<br />Now we come to VOYAGER... What the...??? Very shoddy packaging. The discs are blank and have the episodes written (in a spiral) on the clear plastic rim in the center of the disc. Someone even forgot that &quot;Caretaker&quot; was the first episode. No pics either. The color is nice (compared to DS9's basic black) but the plastic splits into two awkward pieces.<br />I cannot see spending $100 per season when it is obvious that Berman &amp; Braga are just out to screw the fans for every last dollar they can get their grubby little hands on.<br />I envision the ENTERPRISE packaging will consist of DVD-R discs thrown into a plastic baggy with some bubble wrap in it.<br />Paramount should be ashamed of themselves for such a blatant rip-off.
B000002H33|5.0|Metallica are of the finest hard rock/metal bands of all time. Master of puppets is probably their best record to date. From the beginning to the end, the album takes listener to another level. &quot;Master of puppets&quot; with its awesome riffs is in my view the best song on this album. &quot;Welcome Home&quot; and &quot;The thing that should not be&quot; are equally good.<br />I'm not much into describing albums, so I will only say that this album gave me hope and energy when life seemed to end. It has this amazing power which is beyond any other music ever created. I would suggest this masterpiece for ALL, even for those who don't like metallica. As for me, Metallica would always rule as Lars Ulrich says, &quot;No rules, But metallica rules&quot;.
B00006RU5B|5.0|First off,if u have heard about audioslave being rage against the machine minus Zack De La Rocha(the lead singer) and are considering going for this album stop. this sounds absoloutely nothing like rage against the machines' hip hop/rock style.Chris Cornell(the new lead singer)has taken the band into a totaly different type of music ,that i think,really shows off the great playing skills of the rest of the band.There are some heavy songs like cochise and gasoline but most of the album is more slow rock(apart from most of the choruses which can get quite heavy) if you like the last 2 red hot chili peppers albums,calafornication and by the way(i highly recomend both of them),you will see some resmabalance between the slow songs on this like shadow on the sum(the stanzas mostly) and songs like tear on by the way.However, there is a lot more resembalance from this album too not aswell none band placebo's new album,sleeping with ghosts; they both have a few fast songs,but most of the songs are slow but with fast choruses.If you like punk bands like limp biskit or papa roach forget it,there is almost no chance you will like this.<br />Matt Clough
B00006LLNU|5.0|I really enjoy this CD. It is great minimalist music. The lack of lyrics (in all Sigur Ros music) makes just another instrument. <br />Definitely the more interesting and compelling music that I have heard in the last year. If you like to heard new sound it is a must...
B000000OQF|5.0|this album is not overated. it extremely underated. out of all my friends 4 of them have heard of guns n' roses and out of them there is only 1 girl.there should be a law saying everyone has to listen to this at least once.most perople will be familar with welcome to the jungle and sweet child 'o mine and some people may of heard the lesser none third single from the album,paradise city, but there is a lot more to it than that. i cant really describe the album its just so good.1 of my favourite albums of all time along with calafornication(red hot chili peppers), audioslave(audioslave) and somwhere in time(iron maiden). put in 1 word this album is AWESOME!<br />Matt Clough
B000002G7E|4.0|this is without a doubt the most extreme of all 4 of the velvets albums. while not as amazing as the bands debut album, this is still a very influential, and legendary piece of work. the title track is one of the bands classic songs, and probably the first, or one of the first punk songs ever. the gift is a story about a guy who ships himself to his girlfriend who he feels is cheating on him. its pretty strange, not something you'd listen to all the time. lady godivas operation is about an old folk tale, and has a very disturbing ending. here she comes now is a short song, and very melodic, one of the albums best cuts. i heard her call my name is one of the loudest songs ever. its pretty fuzzed up, and lou does some pretty impressive gutiar work in it. sister ray is up there with heroin, wating for hte man, sweet jane, and rock n roll as one of the main pieces of velvet underground music. 17 minutes of guitar noise, and lyrics about sex, drugs, and every other impure thing in the world. lou's lyrics always are amaizng, but they really stand out here as some of his best. if you are new to the velvets, definetly pick up there debut album.if you are pretty into them, and lou solo, get this. its a classic.
B00018D44U|4.0|This is a good CD with a very diverse musical style. It is obvious that the people that do not like it are pigeon-holed into one style of music and do not venture away from that. It is refreshing to see a musical artist that can go between styles of music with ease and do it well. It is so boring to hear a musical artist that sounds exactly the same on every one of their albums. I do not like every song on the CD but 80% of it I can listen to and I think she has a fantastic voice. There is one song where I think she sounds like Dolly Parton.
6301967992|4.0|Laugh yourself to death when you're not crawling under the couch out of fear ... . The movie, a real vampire film complete with more than enough horror, is also a spoof on vampire films. Several scenes come to mind (from long ago!). First, the beautiful tavern girl bathing as a new vampire, the recently bitten taven owner,  bursts through the window. She flashes a crucifix before his eyes and his head darts to the side....and then he faces her, \\"Wrong religion, my dear!\\" Then, the old vampire researcher and his assistant (Polanski) enter 'the castle' and meet the vampire. Researcher and vampire quote their academic sources competitively to each other, the one trying to outdo the other.<br />I gave the film 4 stars instead of 5 because I'm one of those with a tendency to crawl under the couch .... . The scene with Polanski and the professor crawling around on the roof of the castle is too unforgetable.
B00018D44U|5.0|I have to admit that, when I heard this album, I was a bit dissapointed that stylistically, this release isn't the same as her debut album.  But come to think of it, why would I want to pay the money and listening to the same exact stuff? If you are looking for a repeat of the 1st album then do just that, listen to the first album.  Can you imagine how limiting it can be to a young singer, so full of potential, only to have her singing range limited by her fans. I am GLAD that the album is different. Yes, the style is a bit different but her phrasing, style and voice stayed the same; beautiful.  I highly recommned this album and please give it a chance to be what it IS and not what we expect it to be.
1401300901|1.0|I was looking very forward to reading this book, but within minutes of cracking it open I was disapointed. I found the plot to be shallow and cliched and the characters to be rather static and underdeveloped. Ahern has brought nothing new to &quot;chick lit&quot;. If you are looking for a melodramatic fairy tale read this book, but if you are looking for depth, creativity, and genuine wit....you wont find it here.
B0001KL5DA|5.0|I am seriously displeased with the way HBO has been scheduling the releases of their shows. The first season was released Feb. 2003...and now we get the second season June 2004!!!....oh man...on this rate if the show would to go off the air next season...we have to wait till 2008 to get it!!. <br />Anywho, the set includes some great episodes and further develops all the members of the Fisher family. In this season, the show begins to depart with basing its entire show around a particular death...and develops some more uniformed and intriguing storyline within the characters themselves. It promptly picks up where the last season ended off with Nate's impending surgery. I'll be first to admit that the first episode is kind of a clunker...but the show never looks back from then on. The last two episodes in particular reach almost unbearable depths of dramatic height especially with all the trails and tribulations concerning the relationship between Nate and Brenda. An engaging, quirky show which truly shows you the emotional levels that a television show can still have on the average viewer. I cant tell you how much I honestly love this show. Highly Recommended!!!<br />and you know what???...Season 3 is even better! ;)  (mb...dec 2005 this time??....ugh....get it together HBO!)
B00007G207|5.0|Cinema Paradiso is a definite classic and is a must-watch for any self-respecting film buff.  I first watched this movie (the cut-version) in 1994 on television.  I loved it so much that I watched it frequently on tape thereafter.  I think I've watched it 2 times a year (on average) and that would make it 20 times by now!   <br /> <br />The innocence of childhood, the passion of first loves, the cruel reality of adulthood are all depicted to perfection in the movie.  Its bitter-sweet ending tops the theme of the whole movie off and it never failed to make me tear.  I had so many questions each time after I watched the movie and that in itself, further reinforced the various main themes of the story: lost loves and most importantly, the great sense of regret that is a result of a lifetime filled with multitudes of unanswered questions.  It was incredibly disappointing as I knew I'd never know the answers to all the questions that I had about the film.  I had great pity for Toto as well as he'd never know.  But this was all before I realised that there was an uncut version. <br /> <br />I upgraded to the DVD version sometime ago but never got around to watching it.  I loaned it out to a friend and got it back months later.  I decided to watch it on a particularly boring afternoon.  As I knew the film so well, I realised that there were scenes in the DVD version which I never saw in the 'old' version.  As I watched further, more of such scenes came up.  And it dawned on me that this version could contain some answers to the many questions which I had!  I watched it right to the end and it still made me tear.  But this time, I was touched not by the storyline itself but by the fact that all the questions that I ever had about the film have finally been answered.  A chapter in Toto's life had finally been closed and for myself, it was also like closing a chapter in my own 'cinematic life'.   <br /> <br />I suggest all interested viewers to watch the 'cut' version first,then the 'uncut' version.  It's a wonderful cinematic experience and allows you to understand and fully appreciate the true essence of the film.  The film was previously cut as it was too long.  With the release of the 'uncut' version, it serves to strongly remind the audience of the greatness of cinema, particularly how the same film can invoke such different emotions by the mere act of cutting some scenes.

0156027321|1.0|&quot;Man eating trees?&quot; I have never read such putrid filth in my entire life. This book has the worst plot and story of any book I have ever read. I have no Idea where the author was able to dig up such stupid Ideas but he must have tried pretty hard to make a book that is this bad. The only reason I ever touched such a stining pile of dinosaur dung is because I had to read it fo a language arts project. The book is full of completely random and stupid Ideas that it kept leaving me with questions that I sure as hell did not want answered.I think that the writer should be blacklisted and never alowed to publish his work ever again.
B00005K3O4|5.0|This movie rocks! I first saw it on Sci-Fi and loved it! I went to hastings later that day and sure enough I found it. It was on VHS but I didn't care! But, with my luck, about 1-2 months later it came out on DVD. so, I sold the VHS one and bought it on DVD. Killer Klowns has loads of special features. <br />Two teens are out on some hill and see a comet/meteor go flying past them. They decide to go find it and check it out. They find it and decide to go in, by they way it looks like a circus tent. They explore around and find some of the klowns. They freak out and go hide in this room with these cotton candy things. They open one up and find out that they are storing bodies in them. They run out get in there car and go to the police. Pretty soon the klowns start recking havoc on the town. This is one of my top 10 favorite movies along with dead alive and bad taste! by the way this is nothing like those two movies that I just mentioned.
0375759174|1.0|That's right, this book will put you to sleep.  This has to be one of the most excruciating novels I have ever read. There is hardly any conflict in the plot.  If you would like to read about people going to balls and other formal occasions every night, then you will like this book. ****Spoiler Ahead Don't read if you don't want to know.****** The climax of the novel is when Catherine finds out the General kicked her out of the house because she was not rich.  BORING!!!!!  This book is extremely overrated.  The novel is also hard to follow at times since Jane Austen jumps from one time frame to another time a lot longer down the road in only one sentence.  If your teacher or professor makes you read this book, then good luck. I would pass on this book if you are looking for an intellectual stimulation or just plain old good story.
B00018D44U|3.0|There is no denying that Norah Jones is a talented woman who took the music world by storm with a quiet and elegant release and general approach that seems downright counterintuitive in today's shock and awe marketing campaigns that seek to find a place for largely talent-less &quot;singers.&quot; I became a fan overnight and thought that her debut CD earned 4 stars. Norah's second release &quot;Feels Like Home&quot;, certainly avoids the sophomore jinx, but in my opinion it does not pack the quiet punch of her debut.<br />The Good: The CD starts off very well and opens up with the optimistic and lively &quot;Sunrise&quot;, which ups her country element to a higher degree while not neglecting her jazzy piano. &quot;What Am I To You&quot; is my favorite song on this release may be the liveliest that Norah has ever sounded. The musical arrangement is so bluesy (do I dare say Stevie Ray Vaugh-ish) and filled with vocal passion that it seems like a natural expansion to her repertoire. &quot;Those Sweet Words&quot; has Norah sounding as warm and expressive with her elegant piano playing and strings making it one of her finest songs to date. &quot;Carnival Town&quot; has a k.d. land feel (circa her &quot;Ingenue&quot; release) and I mean this as a complement as it's not a knock off of k.d. and simply represents a nice change of pace for Norah. &quot;Creepin' In&quot; showcases Norah's country roots, and while the song is contagious in parts, most of the pleasure of this song comes from Dolly Parton's strong voice and ear for melody. Norah seems somewhat out of her element but the song works because of Dolly. &quot;Humble Me&quot; starts out with Simon and Garfunkel inspired strings and showcases the best of Nora's warm voice. The song is slow but not sleep-inducing as the lyrics are good and her voice is pure Norah with a touch of Bonnie Raitt thrown in for good measure. In both &quot;The Prettiest Thing&quot; and &quot;Don't Miss You At All&quot; has Norah doing what she does best, which is evoking the feeling of a late night session with her rich voice and piano right in front of her.<br />The Not So Good: Both &quot;In The Morning&quot; just falls flat. &quot;Be Here To Love Me&quot; is much better, but the problem in both is not in Norah's voice but songs, especially the former, that do not go anywhere lyrically or musically. &quot;Toes&quot; sounds very soothing, but it lacks anything that registers a pulse and is truly sleep inducing. Not the worst offense in the world, but I am certain that easing one to sleep is Norah's intent as one would miss the rest of the CD. I am not being flip here. &quot;Above Ground&quot; is dead on arrival, despite some great guitar work. &quot;The Long Way Home&quot; sounds (cheap pun intended) like a long and way too slow way home.<br />In a nutshell, this is a good effort that has Norah sounding less jazzy and more country-tinged than in her first release. The problem here lies in that she greatly reduces the noirish tone that works so well for her before and ups the country-twanged elements (both in her voice and arrangements) and she winds up sounding much less convincing than in her first release as there are many singers who have stronger voices (like Bonnie Raitt and Sheryl Crow) that can bring to life the country elements that stagnate quite a few of the songs. To end on a good note, there is rawness in the production that's refreshing as she allows even a few off-key notes to remain. Also, although it may not look like it to some, this release shows some quiet yet notable experimentation. Not all of it works, but it is always refreshing to hear something that was not created for mass market consumption. What the music industry does not get is that the more they focus on talent over veils, they will wind up selling millions along the way as this release already has. It may sound tough to give this only 3 stars, but I still lean towards recommending it for the points highlighted above.e does best, which is evoking the feeling of a late night session with her rich voice and piano right in front of her.<br />The Not So Good: Both &quot;In The Morning&quot; just falls flat. &quot;Be Here To Love Me&quot; is much better, but the problem in both is not in Norah's voice but songs, especially the former, that do not go anywhere lyrically or musically. &quot;Toes&quot; sounds very soothing, but it lacks anything that registers a pulse and is truly sleep inducing.

B00005JMJ4|1.0|Why even go to Tokyo, if you're going to shoot 90 percent of the movie inside a hotel?<br />The characters were boring, and the movie was about them being bored. So guess what? I was bored. If it was supposed to be a comedy, it failed because I didn't laugh once.<br />Usually, in a drama the characters experience a change by the end of the movie. There was no change here. I guess I lost the point. Maybe if you are going through a midlife crisis, you can relate to this waste of film.<br />DTS? Why?
B00005BIIP|5.0|This cd is great for any fan of music.  While I will stress they aren't easy to find anymore they are wroth looking for just for Buying New Soul alone!  The other songs are great as well including: In Formaldahyde, Cure For Optimism, Ambulance chasing, Access Denied and (of course)  The extended verison of Even Less.  This is a great cd to just listen to when you've got some free time and can sit down and listen to it all the way through.  Recordings is a great album for not just Porcupine Tree fans but any fan of well executed music.
B0001HAISG|5.0|Seeing this movie in the theater was something of a marvel. My wife and I were surrounded by little children, each of which were more excited about this movie than I had seen for Lord of the Rings, or Star Wars, or any major epic in recent years. See this movie was meant for them. We all know and love the story of Peter Pan, and a good many of us also fell in love with the unofficial sequel Hook (albeit only after it hit home video and DVD as its theatrical presentation didn't fare to well.) But it was only after seeing this movie sitting next to a young girl, about 6 or 7 at the most and seeing how she responded to this film did I begin to understand what Peter Pan is. Its a story about the tragedy of loosing our innocence, about being forced to grow up, and take on adult responsibilities when we all would much rather just play and have fun. Most of all its about wanting the best of both worlds, the things that come with adulthood such as love, and family, without having to sacrifice the comforts of childhood. That is the inner struggle of Peter Pan. He wants to love, but knows that he cannot, because if he gives into his heart it means he would have to grow up. It's amazing to see a movie that so beautifully captures the emotional struggle that children go through at that age. The inner struggle to cling to the things that are fun, and innocent, and childish, versus the desire to become independent, to love and be loved beyond a mother-son-brother-father type of setting, and yet the need to be cared for and taken care of. I was blown away by this movie because quite simply... I have never read the book, and I had no idea Peter Pan was this deep. The most moving part was when the girl I was sitting next to cried into her mother's chest proclaiming that she didn't want to grow up. There is the heart of Peter Pan, realizing that inevitably we all grow up, we'll all have bills, we'll all have unsatisfactory jobs (with a few exceptions), we'll all grow old, and most important we'll all die. Peter Pan is a symbol defying this cycle that binds and imprisons all adults. I suddenly find myself wishing I hadn't grown up either. That's not to say that I don't enjoy the benefits of being an adult, but this movie did make me yearn again for my younger days. Without a doubt, this movie is a must see for everyone. Child and adult alike this film will reach you in ways that no other presentation of this story has ever accomplished.portant we'll all die.

B00008J4P5|5.0|I will now try and explain why this is the best album of this past year in twenty words. Here goes: The best and most recognized bass riff of the year came from a band that refuses to have a bassist. There you have it. Check for my previous review of this album for a more comprehensive reason why it is.
B000003TA4|5.0|This album is definitely a classic, whether you feel it deserves the praise it gets or not, it is as important a milestone in the history of music as any Beatles or Robert Johnson album.<BR>On first hearing this album it is the simple, catchy melodies which draw you in but before long the lyrics become the more prominent feature, at once you recognise what Kurt is trying to say but at the same time the lyrics are somewhat confusing and one is encouraged to meditate on the songs.<BR>In trying to decode the often related metaphors of songs such as Lounge Act you begin to see the world through the Kurt Cobain perspective. Driving these twisted lyrics is Kurt's raw, billiant voice which communicates the feeling's lying beneath  the verse. One hears pain, passion, honesty and joy in his voice. Adding to this is Kurt's thundersous guitar, Dave's percussion and Krist base, all combining to create the distinctive sound of this album. <BR>Every Nirvana song, not just those on Nevermind, possess a part of the soul of Kurt Cobain. We were denied incredibly quickly the chance to hear another, yet are drawn to them forever.
B00018D44U|5.0|Sometimes, sophomore efforts slump, and often they turn out well. Rarely, though, does a second offering hit the perfect chord as Feels Like Home does. <BR>With this album, Norah Jones changes just enough to differentiate from her debut, Come Away With Me, without deconstructing what she does so well - the mellow, soft, serene, piano-based tune. On Feels Like Home, Jones tweaks the instrumentation, adding a base line here and placing some acoustic parts there, and interprets lyrical content that is both unique and relevant. \\"In the Morning\\" contains this line - \\"Funny how my favorite shirt smells more like you than me.\\" \\"Carnival Town\\" offers this thought - \\"Did the clown make you smile? He was only your fool for a while.\\" One of the album's best offerings, the jazzy and poignant \\"The Prettiest Thing,\\" offers this - \\"The prettiest thing I ever did see was lighting from the top of the clouds, moving through the night a million miles an hour with somewhere to go.\\"<br />Feels Like Home is just beautiful, a flawless progression from Come Away With Me. Jones' velvety voice melts into music. Perhaps the most endearing track is \\"Don't Miss You At All.\\" You imagine Jones sitting alone with a piano in some quiet place releasing thoughts and molding melodies without effort.
0425152251|3.0|This book has two distinct parts, a very \\"dreamy\\" novel and a course in philosophy.  It begins with Sophie Amundsen, a 15 year old girl in Norway in the late twentieth a century, receiving mail from a mysterious stranger, mail that turns out to be a course in philosophy.  <br />I found the history of philosophy as presented here interesting, some of the philosophers named here were somewhat familiar to me and I learned more, I liked the author's way of making connections from one stream of thought to the next over the centuries.  However when I came across anyone I know a great deal about such as Darwin or Freud, I found those sections of the book to be quite shallow and biased as well as to what was included.  I would have liked to have seen him go further with the twentieth century, how could he think of leaving out Carl Jung in a book like this????<br />The novel part of the book was totally unappealing to me, it just became too ridiculous.  Alice in Wonderland herself is a character, and the story seemed like wonderland to me something a mind under the influence of strong drugs might \\"dream\\" up.  Like a book for children but too mature for children.
B00018D44U|5.0|&quot;Feels Like Home&quot; the second delivery by Miss Jones is not a stranger to any who bought her jazzy debut album, she kept the escence of the first and made a new one with more innovative lyrics that don't dissapoint the listener. She works again with hit-maker producer Arif Mardin, and has some special guest like the country-legend Dolly Parton. Not that Jones it's known by her singles on the radio, but, her first cut to be release and promote &quot;Sunrise&quot; is delightful and lite, with the same chillout feeling that enchanted us the first time with &quot;Don't Know Why&quot;, in conclution all the tracks will give you time to think, listen to the music, sleep, drink coffee, or simply study, it's a very versatile record, so all the tracks are easy to handle and in the same formula, the lyrics change, and some sound more country than jazz, but if I have to mention some stand out cuts will be : &quot;Sunrise&quot;, &quot;The Long Way Home&quot;, &quot;Creepin' In.&quot;, &quot;Don't Miss You at All,&quot;, overall this is a great record that could take your stress away.
B00004YA66|5.0|I loved every minuete of it from the beginnign to the end.  Touching thriller of a film and the fire scenese were excellent in depicting that time period and everything. The score of the movie is well versed for each moment.  Highly recommended.
B0001AP12G|5.0|This album...I love it. Kanye West is going to blow up. I think he has a thing for teddy bears...but he is still awesome. I like the Through the Wire song a lot. I can't believe he recorded it with his jaw wired shut. Wow. I think he will sweep the Grammys next year.
0452282152|5.0|I absolutely LOVED this book!  It's been a while since I found a book that kept me up till all hours of the night - but this one did it. I read it over the weekend and then went and saw the movie.  The movie does not follow the book very well at all - so I din't like it - but deffinately read the book.
B000031XCR|5.0|Ok, I really am tired of people thinking that if a person doesn't write music AND play an instrument, then they don't deserve to be in the music industry. That is crap!! If a person can sing, then they deserve a record deal. And even when someone DOES come along who writes and plays piano (like Vanessa Carlton) people still complain. Obviously, you can't please everybody. <br />Regardless of what kind of music you like, a person is a liar if they say that this woman cannot sing. Her sheer vocal power is AMAZING and you can't mistake that voice for anyone else. No, this music certainly isn;t edgy or controversial. Yes, it is safe. Is that bad? no, not always!! What's wrong with a fun lighthearted cd?? People complain about artists like Christina who are so &quot;risque&quot; and are NEVER boring, but they also complain about a &quot;safe&quot; singer like Celine. Seems like most people are hypocrites..<br />Anyway, in short, if you love power ballads as much as I do, buy this!!!
