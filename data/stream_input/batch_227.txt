B00005JKYS|4.0|Mel Gibson has been type-casted as the leading hero for movies such as \\"Braveheart\\" (which he directed, produced, acted), \\"The Patriot\\" & for \\"We Were Soldiers\\", he snugged in the role comfortably.  For this offering, he rejoined with Randall Wallace, who penned \\"Braveheart\\".  This time, Randall Wallace took the helm, & perhaps, he's been given more flexibility by Mel's film company, Icon Production, & therefore, \\"We Were Soldiers\\" was able to shine whereas \\"Pearl Harbour\\" wouldn't match.  One of Randall's forte was to give us a glimpse of humanity at work in the war that United States shouldn't be involved at the first place.  For the first time, Vietnamese was shown a matching fighter against US' military might.  We were also brought into the realm of the armies' families witnessing first-hand the wives' initial denial but eventual acceptance of the demise of their husbands (& fathers of their children).  Their greivance were heart-felt & for the first time, we were shown perspective of both Americans & Vietnamese.  I sincerely believe that this movie covered a lot of ground such as bringing to our attention that in a war, it's irrelevant what races they are.  The soldiers are brothers in arms, & they are fighting the war as Americans & therefore, in time of dire needs, it's their duty to look after one another.  The movie questioned the need of fighting someone else's war, & brought to surface the treatment of soldiers when they returned from Vietnam, friendly fire.  In the end, when we were shown the Memorial at Washington by Maya Lin then, we would start to appreciate the poignancy but continuing legacy of America's foreign policy.  Highly recommended but not for the faint-hearted.  It's good to see Madeline Stowe back to the silver screen again, & the leading lady from TV series, Felicity acting in a feature movie, & what a display of talent from Nina from 3rd Rock from the Sun.  Greg Kinnear, Sam Elliot, & other supporting cast were simply splendid
B000002GYR|5.0|I think this cd is just brilliant. i love all of waits' singing as well as the class instrumentation. adds jazz and blues to already brilliant artistry. grapefruit moon, rosie and martha are classics, along with ol' 55 and i hope that i don't fall in love with you. i actually only have three Waits albums- Closing time, heartattack and vine and rain dogs, can anyone suggest me an even better one because this simply is cream of the crop. it's fantastic.
B00005YXZH|5.0|As someone who has a diverse interest in music I became a fan of Wilco six years ago.  Wilco leader, Jeff Tweedy, has become one of the best lyricists of all time and has added to his song writing abilities by collabrating with other hard working musicians and songwriters.  John Stirrat has been working with Jeff since their days with Uncle Tupelo and has proven his writing abilities and ability to not let egos get in the way by continuing to work with Jeff while also achieving individual accomplishments.  Leroy Bach and Glen Kotcjhe are still fairly new members of Wilco but have made their influences show since joining the band.  Unfortunately, Yankee Hotel Foxtrot will be the last album that Jay Bennett will write with Jeff as a member of Wilco.  Jay's departure from the band is a gigantic loss to Wilco and their fans.  While we don't know why Jay Bennett left Wilco, except that he is pursuing other goals, we do know that the collaboration of Jeff Tweedy and Jay Bennett has ended before they could be reveered as one of the best songwriting duos since McCartney and Lennon.  Jay Bennett has recently released an album with Ed Burch that is good, good like comparing the Wings to the Beatles. Congratulations to Wilco and Jay Bennet for putting out one of the best albums of all time, Yankee Hotel Foxtrot.
B00003CXDG|1.0|This is a really bad movie. No one could act not even Tom Cruise, the writer must have been drunk when he wrote it, and it seems that whole movie was just trying to look like The Matrix only this movie has no plot.I mean this movie shouldn't even be listed as the sequal. Mission Impossible 1 always kept you guessing, you never knew what was going to happen next, but in this one you always know whats going to happen. What's that oh another rubber mask HO HUM!!!!!<br />all in all the only impossible mission here is trying to stay awake! BUY AT YOUR OWN RISK
0767827791|3.0|A small-town household of women become fascinated by a drifter's hormones--and on the stage William Inge's subtle and intimate tale of sexual frustration, lost opportunties, and the mythical promise of youth proved popular with both audiences and critics alike.  On the other hand, Joshua Logan's screen version has brassy good looks--and is about as subtle and intimate as a buffalo stampede down Main Street at high noon.<br />Director Logan made his name as a theatrical director by staging big budget productions with plenty of stage picture, so it should come as no surprise that his handling of this material is both stagey and way too literal.  Both Novak and Holden are too old for their roles, but more to the point they are both wildly miscast.  Novak's stunning beauty and cool self-assurance is completely at odds with the role of Madge, an unsure small-town pretty girl; Holden, although he had his share of virile charm, lacks the mix of innocence and raw sexuality the role requires.  As a couple, they seem to belong to an entirely different movie.<br />On the plus side, PICNIC offers an interesting if occasionally problematic score that features the memorable \\"Moonglow;\\" some very nice if largely inappropriate cinematography; and a truly fine supporting cast, with Arthur O'Connell and Rosalind Russell standouts in the cast.  But not even Russell's brilliant turn as the determinedly over-compensating spinster school teacher can ignite this film, which for all its good looks never comes to life.  Worth seeing once, but you're better off catching a stage revival at a good rep company.
B00005QZ7U|5.0|This movie has it all comedy, romance, and good acting. The story is your typical love story(will the girl chose the rich guy that will give her everything or the poor guy that can only offer true love), but this typical story has a twist. All the people were way out there and all the actors played them well, but the thing that made this movie so great was the music and how it was used. Instead of using music written for the story they used songs we all know and put them together in whole new way. I mean what's better than a witty carnival man and a nerdy duke singing like a virgin
B00005YTFG|2.0|This movie clearly was a high budget attempt to be artistically creative.  Instead, it is a rather dull, failed attempt.  Perhaps the best example of what makes this movie a poor one is the ridiculous plot device in which the singing and dancing Nicole Kidman has tuberculosis.  The problem here is that she is on the verge of death - you find this out at the end - yet somehow, she is able to belt out tremendous musical numbers and dance in several sequences throughout the movie that would wear an average person out.  Yet, as any numbskull knows, this would be rather impossible for someone who was on the verge of dying from tuberculosis.  This is just one example of how Moulin Rouge attempts to be a great movie, but ultimately fails.  If you like musicals then I would recommend that you rent this, as it has some interesting use of modern songs in a setting 100 years ago (although my heart broke when \\"Smells Like Teen Spirit\\" was butchered at the opening).  However, I would definitely not recommend buying this movie.
B000001IQH|5.0|This has to be one of the most listenable CDs ever produced, assuming you like the genre.  Maybe even a little too easy to listen to.  This CD has never been very far from my CD player for nearly seven years.  I think that is a feat in and of itself, as most of my CDs rarely see the light of day until I get a weird feeling to listen to them again.  If you can make out the lyrics, they have some meaning.  If you can't, just let the guitars carry you away, and before you notice, an hour has passed and you will be late for work.

ON INITIAL LISTENING TO THE ALBUM THOUGHT IT WAS GREAT, NOW I RATE IT AS ONE OF MY FAVOURITES EVER. EVERY TRACK ON THE ALBUM IS WORTHY OF A MENTION, I PARTICALLY LIKE FAKE PLASTIC TREES. GO OUT AND BUY THIS ALBUM IT'S A MASTERPIECE.
B00003CXA4|5.0|It's a shame to start off a review of such a crucially important film and story with superficialities, but I have to mention right off the bat that this is the most attractively packaged DVD I have ever seen.  The acetate slip-cover layers so well over the DVD case itself, especially the back-cover with the inset of a smiling Gandhi which layers over the throbbing masses by the train station in India.<br />Also, the extras in this film are truly phenomenal.  The standout:  actual footage of Gandhi in the 40s, actual speech by him and actual headlines from newspapers of the time.  Not only does the owner of this DVD get treated to a superb dramatization of one of the most important stories of our time, but they actually get to meet the subject, himself.<br />EVERYBODY SHOULD SEE THIS MOVIE!!!  India is the world's largest democracy, and 2nd most populous country.  It has one of the oldest uninterrupted civilizations and has been reponsible for more bodies of knowledge than the West is ready to give it credit for.  India's greatest human, Mohandas Gandhi, of the last couple of hundred years or so is a most noble subject.  This film wonderfully shows Gandhi's unimaginably unflinching pacificsm and social disobedience which bought India's freedom from the cruel British rule, and it necessarily shows the vast human cost that India paid to gain its rightful independence.<br />Highlights of this 9-time Academy Award winner are Ben Kingsley's Oscar-winning performance as Gandhi, himself, the wonderful acting jobs of Roshan Seth (\\"Mississippi Masala\\", \\"Monsoon Wedding\\" - both must sees) as Nehru, the ever-present Indian actors Saeed Jaffrey, Amrish Puri, Om Puri, and Rohini Hattangadi (as Gandhi's wife), and Edward Fox, who did an uncanny job of portraying the indescribably wicked (and brainwashed?) General Dyer, perpetrator of the Amritsar Massacre.<br />In addition to great acting, some of the most poignant examples of the horrors of India's struggle for her independence,in terms of Indian civilian casualties, are included:  the brutalities at the Dharasana salt mine as well as the aforementioned Amritsar Massacre.  These two examples show the absolute, unconscionable British brutality.  The film also necessarily showed the sad truth:  that a people can be bought to oppress their own, and that the divisions within an oppressed people will inevitably flare up to disastrous results once the common oppression is overthrown (see:  200,000 Hindus and Muslims slaughtering each other in communal riots during the actual gaining of independence).<br />There are a couple of MAJOR gripes with this movie, though, in terms of crediting.  Every single actor listed on the case is white (British or American), and every single actor listed in the Filmographies Extra is white.  Amazon, themselves, list only British/American actors in the first ten names on \\"cast list\\" for this item, despite the fact that all of the major movie-spanning roles, except for that of Gandhi, were played by actual Indians (Roshan Seth, Saeed Jaffrey) who are every bit as accomplished as their American and British counterparts.  Another note of outrage is that this movie was filmed in both English and Hindi, yet there is neither Hindi language option nor Hindi subtitle option (nor any other Indian language, for that matter).  How sad that the technical features of this movie alienate the people who are the subjects of this movie and how sad it is that the people trying to sell it to you right now only further perpetuate the malappropriation of credit.
0385493622|5.0|The reader cannot avoid admiring the determination of Andrew Wiles, who becomes the role model (and inspiration) for the nonmathematician.  This book discusses several important mathematical topics without assuming a mathematical background.  The descriptions of what life is like for modern mathematicians are a good way to present the human side of math.  <br />For anyone who wants to return to math but is afraid to do so, here is a good way to start.  The more difficult topics of the book are explained in general terms throughout the book itself, and are then discussed more thoroughly in an appendix.  This strategy makes the readers aware that they can return to those topics when feeling better prepared or more confident.
B00005Y228|4.0|I remember back in the mid 80's when  Kylie Minogue storming onto the US music scene with the cover \\"The LocoMotion\\" on her first album produced and marketed by \\"The Stock People\\" which a good friend of mine called for short. \\"The Stock People\\" or Stock,Aitken & Waterman where at one time where gods for the pop stars that they could turn a single release into gold.  It worked for Kylie, Rick Astley and brought back disco diva Donna Summer back into the spotlight.  But then Kylie's popularity in the US kinda went under. Well, to be exact, Kylie never actually went away.  She still released albums abroad while her popularity in the US went unoticed for a few years.  Then in 2001 she made a brief appearance in Baz Lurhmann's \\"Moulin Rouge\\".  To be followed by a hot single smash EVERYWHERE \\"Can't Get You Outta My Head\\" from her debut Capitol Records Release \\"Fever\\".  In addition to Kylie's comeback in the US scene, the folks at BMG decides to jump on the bandwagon of Kylies popularity releasing  a Greatest Hits compilation when she recorded under them at one time. Dont have her BMG stuff yet but I am working on it!!!
B00005V3Z4|5.0|What a great movie!  I watched it 4 times in 48hours, i just couldn't get enough of it!  It is definetly worth buying!!
B00003CXWV|4.0|The movie is a 'blow you away' adaptation of Bruce Porter's book. It drives home George Jung's rise and fall, and how in-the-home conflicts during one's upbringing can influence your view of the world and where within it you belong - in this case, George kept wanting more and more despite the risks.  Johnnie Depp and Penelope Cruz literally BECOME the Jungs.  More references to Cape Cod where a lot of the story takes place would have been nice.  It's an incredible roller coaster ride!!
B00005JKJA|5.0|The first viewing of this film provides as much of a cinematic thrill ride as you'll ever get from a movie.  Subsequent viewings enable one to actually figure out a lot about what's going on in the plot.  It makes more sense each time you view it, but only if you're observant and you're willing to do a bit of thinking.  One interesting aspect of this film is that the cinematography is largely bright and cheery, which makes it a substantial departure from much of Lynch's work.
B00005JCAA|5.0|I was encapsulated from the very beginning of the movie.  I found it very clever and interesting.  Brad Pitt has a very redeeming role in this as with Fight Club.  The characters are very awesome...and very quaint at some points.  You grow very attached to them in the 181 minutes the movie lasts.  Anthony Hopkinds is amazing, playing a rich business man turning 65 years old in a few weeks from the beginning of the movie.<br />Brad Pitt is unknown for most of the time he is in the movie...but his character \\"joe black\\" is so amazing, you are lost in his mysterious nature.  THis is a love story and also a beautiful tale...glad that it was different then most of the movies I have seen recently.<br />I am an avid movie watcher...LOL  Anyway...watch this if you like a good story but if you don't like romance then don't...but if you like supernatural ways to find love then watch this!!

B00003CX5P|3.0|As a piece of the Star Wars franchise, this movie is disappointing.  The effects were excellent, but plotwise...  It was good to see why the jedi had the reputation they had in Episodes 4 - 6, but if they were so smart, why didn't they kill Jar Jar Binks (an amazingly anoying character meant to appeal to the five year olds out there).<br />See it for the battle scenes and the pod race.  Don't see it for deep insights into the person who became Darth Vader.<br />And as OB1 said to Darth Maul, \\"you are the weakest link.  Good-bye.\\"
020530902X|5.0|This is one of the only books that a writer can refer another writer to in the effort of guiding someone else on how to write.  The advice is so commonsense that it is often overlooked.  The writing itself is written in plain language that often jumps off the page.  The detailed examples of fallacies and correct grammar usage are essential in any writer's understanding of proper structure on the way to developing their own style.  This book, along with Stephen King's &quot;On Writing,&quot; will be the two books that I, as a writer, will always defer to when speaking to another writer about how to write.  This classic will live as long as our language does.
B0000542D2|5.0|The title of my review says it all. So much has been written about A Hard Day's Night that I can't imagine what else to add. When the movie was re-released in late 2000, I took my then-11-year-old daughter to see the film.  She knew about the Beatles because I play their CDs so much in the house and in the car, but she'd never seen them on the big screen.  Half the fun of seeing the film in a theater again was watching her reaction to the film...she was smiling all the way through...and so was I!<BR>When we were leaving she said, \\"Dad, they were really good!\\"<br />No kidding!!  And now having a beautiful widescreen print, with all the extras included...well, there'll be many hard day's nights when I'll pop this into the DVD player and lose myself in the fun and the memories of the time.
0060506989|5.0|Being born in 1970, I didn't grow up watching the nightly news regarding the war in Vietnam. This was very educational. It's an eye opener for sure. I think to a certain extent, the things that happened in Vietnam have been glossed over by the U.S., or misinterpreted by the public. This goes to show you how courageous our troops were and how they deserved much better than what they received upon arriving home.
B000002505|5.0|John McLaughlin is probably the most advancing musician on the planet. To team him up with the most lyrical guitarist on the scene was just ingenius. This is a wonderful disc, with &quot;A Love Supreme&quot; being worth the price of admission.
0140557741|5.0|This book will grab your attention as you are drawn into the details of a story without words.  I have used this book with primary aged students and they are delighted in the depth of the details in a story without words.  Really gets them to look at things a little more closely!!
B00000IB4D|5.0|This is Santana with a classic, just after the original Santana band. Still has Mike Shrieve on drums, David Brown on bass, Armando on percussion, but was moving toward a phenomenal jazz-rock period with Tom Coster, etc. This disc includes a great appearance by John McLaughlin, pre- [[ASIN:B0000AKY7R Love Devotion Surrender]] disc. Actually, that title tune appears on this disc. McLaughlin and Santana recorded their groundbreaking team-up soon after this disc. Other greats from this period were [[ASIN:B000002534 Borboletta]], [[ASIN:B000006ZUV Illuminations]] with Alice Coltrane), [[ASIN:B0000027D5 Lotus]], and [[ASIN:B000007VCO Oneness: Silver Dreams Golden Reality]].
B000062XFG|5.0|This season is better than the first, but TNG shines over all other Star Trek sagas. Character development is better, so are storylines (especially the more sciency ones) and even effects. Bring it On! And now on to Season 3...
B000002534|5.0|Amazing period includes Jules Broussard on saxophones and Tom Coster on keyboards. Other greats from this period were &quot;Welcome&quot;, &quot;Illuminations&quot;(with Alice Coltrane), &quot;Lotus&quot;, and &quot;Oneness&quot;.
B00003CXI1|3.0|I never read the book but as a movie there are promblems with its translation to screen.  While the story is basically good the exposition takes a really long time.  By the time you get to the main conflict it feels somewhat thrown in and resolved quickly.  Unfortunately the movie was marketed to fans of the book who are mostly too young to sit through a movie longer than 2 hours.  Harry Potter probably needed about 3 hours or a more efficiant filmaker.  It seems like they wanted to include everything from the books opening but ran out of alotted time or money when the conflict arose.
B00005NB0H|5.0|This is the greatest live rock album of all time, and now it's much better! Great sound and a great show. The Tommy material is worth the price of admission. This band was at it's peak at this time, improvising together like a great jazz band. Think of it as the rock version of Miles and Coltrane. The packaging is wonderful as well, and there is much great information on the band and the show here, with the original inserts that came with the vinyl in the original pressing. A must-hear and a must-own.
B00003CXTG|1.0|This movie is absolutely AWFUL.  There was not a SINGLE redeeming quality about this film.  Normally, if there's a few good explosions or a battle scene, then it usually can save a movie from the trashheap.  It is THAT BAD when I can honestly say that the action did NOTHING to save this film.  <br />Torture.  If you are sado masochistic then this is the movie for you.
B000051VWW|4.0|I've had the CD since it was released and I still don't understand where people are hearing touches of smooth jazz on this disc. Has smooth jazzed evolved so much that it's now, in fact, R&B? Becuase that's what this CD should be stacked under at the record store. I still dig it, though. Despite feeling a little abandoned after becoming infatuated with \\"Love Deluxe\\" and its rich, jazz nuances, I'm learning to let the very basic and very bare programmed beats on this album grow on me. \\"Lover's Rock\\" isn't the most accessible album Sade has ever created, so it stands to reason that even one year hasn't been long enough for me to realize all it has to offer. So let that be my second warning (after \\"Don't expect any smooth jazz\\"): Don't expectto fall in love with it on the first listen. I guess the only complaint I have is that, whenever Sade decides to write a politically driven song--for example, any of the empathize-with-the-jobless-and-destitute songs (which I mostly agree with)-- she spells it all out in painfully cliched terms. Some of these songs, namely \\"Slave Song\\" and \\"Immigrant\\" read more like a United Way brochure. Outside of that, the album is fine. \\"By Your Side\\" is true Sade doing what they do best, as is the brilliantly minimalistic \\"It's Only Love That Gets You Through.\\" The upshot, I suppose, is that there's no risk the album will ever be overcommercialized.  Overall, a good disc in which to invest your time. Also, if you ever have the means to hear Ben Watt's remix of \\"By Your Side\\"--currently only available in the U.S. on his Lazy Dog, vol. 2 CD-- do it.
0385486804|5.0|&quot;Into the Wild&quot; is an interesting story of a young guy who essentially abandoned society and subsisted on nature, but nature got the best of him.  Every family has individuals like this -- my own is larded with similar fruitcakes -- but they usually just stay in place, avoid gainful employment and cause messes for the folks around them.  At least this &quot;Into the Wild&quot; fellow had the courtesy to leave home and not detrimentally involve anyone else in his own personal erosion.
B00005JH7D|5.0|Another one in the basket for our friend Marcus Miller!  I must admit at my first listening of this album, I wasn't sure what I thought, as it was in a slightly different vein to his previous works of the 90's.  However, as with any great peice of musical mastery, it grows on you.  And man, by the time id finnished, this album became a part of me!  It truely is a great album, and damn right for getting best contempory jazz album at the Grammy's!<BR>Marcus displays his musical, and technical prowess on this album even more than ever in my opinion, and yet it remains very refine and intricate, a quality I always admire as a bass player myself.  My personal favourites have to be &quot;Good bye pork hat&quot; and &quot;Red Baron&quot;.I fully recomend any of Marcus Millers to anyone out there, not matter what style of music you listen to, because I assure you, there is something to be learned from every peice of music.

What's more, it makes sense and instructs with minimal grammarian jargon, so you won't have to jot down any funny-looking equations on your hands, create acronyms, or memorize it like a secret formula.

B00005QHPQ|5.0|The lyrics are exceptional.  I wonder if Enrique first wrote and recorded the lyrics to his Escape collection in English? I noticed that he makes use of rhyming lyrics in the English version of his songs. Does the corrsponding lyrics in Spanish also rhyme?  Is his Hero song as successful in Spanish as it is in English?  I do not speak Spanish but have a hunch that rhyming words in one language may not corresponding rhyme in another.
6305781427|3.0|I have this on VHS as well, but I bought the DVD to enjoy through my new Dolby 5.1 surround sound system. Well, the first half of the disc sounds wonderful, but everything in the second half is badly mixed. The right-rear speaker plays almost inaudibly, while the left-rear keeps going at full volume. It's very annoying, and makes the experience less than it should be. The video quality is also not up to DVD standards-there's a lot of shimmering and pixellation, as well as really oversaturated colours. It's a shame, because the music is incredible. The technical flaws really sink this disc.
0375507507|5.0|I thoroughly enjoyed this book. &quot;Bobo&quot;, as she is called as a youngster, has a keen memory of life in Africa growing up as a white African in rural Africa.  She tells stories of her family (including an endlessly teasing sister and half-crazy mother) and all their assorted pets, as they travelled together as a group from farm to farm.  I could totally relate to her descriptions of the sights, smells and sounds of the areas in which she lived!  Having lived myself in Africa as a child and visited as an adult, I say that Alexandra Fuller is spot in with details, racially, geographically and from all (six) senses.  I hated for this to end, this journey into the tales of her childhood.
B00005QY5Y|2.0|I was really looking foward to listening to this cd, given the hype surrounding it.  It starts out on a fantastic note with &quot;New York, New York&quot;, but falls quickly thereafter.  The various music styles just don't seem to mesh, giving the cd a &quot;choppy&quot; feel.<BR>Adams is, however, a talented songwriter, and I'm looking forward to future work from him.
B00005YXZH|5.0|Wilco's label didnt want to touch this???? According to other reviews on here that is the case. Someone should lose their job over it. A beautiful work that gets better with each listen. One of those albums(!) that I predict will gain popularity slowly through word of mouth. 5 star reviews are too common but this truly is a classic worthy of 5 stars.
0345440900|3.0|My husband and I pored through this book before our first child was born, ready and willing to immediately get our little one safely and happily on a schedule by following her directions and watching for the signs she told us we'd see.  So when our baby arrived, we were really shocked by how totally impractical her advice turned out to be, at least for the first three months.  Our daughter did need to eat more frequently, and when I tried to wait the specified time to feed her, my milk supply dwindled; the baby was utterly miserable left alone; she slept and woke for such short periods that I couldn't decide when to even start the schedule. <br />Now that she's older, some of Tracy's advice has proved more doable, but it seemed to us with our daughter that unless we were complete sadists, to start this sort of schedule on a newborn (or at least our newborn) was both impractical and insensitive.  As I've gone back and read it again, I've noticed a subtle but distinct bias against breastfeeding that I overlooked before motherhood, and I also get the feeling that the whole system works terrifically well if you have a live-in nanny to make it happen.<br />I do like the heart of her message, to remind parents that they need to be sensitive to all of their babies' needs and watch and listen to them carefully, and also that parents' needs can't be ignored, but practically, the E.A.S.Y method was anything but, for us and for our daughter.  It's an interesting read, but take it with big grains of salt.
B000002N3J|5.0|I enjoy watching/listening to the stylistic evolution of a wide range of musicians.  Madonna's style &amp; voice have transcended the negative connotations sometimes associated with the 'pop icon' title imho. Many of these songs bring a smile to my face, and truly some are hauntingly beautiful.  Will you like this album?  All I can say is I like stuff ranging from Zeppelin &amp; Sabbath to classical &amp; baroque, with lots of stopping points in between.  And this album's now one of those points for me.

0140177396|4.0|George and Lennie were the best of friends. Lennie was a huge man. He was a hard worker. Lennie was not very smart. He got himself into alot of trouble because he could not understand many situations. Lennie's main concern was to pet nice things and that is what got him into the most trouble. With his size, Lennie did not even understand his own strength. George took care of Lennie. He did all the thinking that Lennie could not do himself. He had patience with Lennie, while other could not. No matter what he still stuck with Lennie and took care of him. Together, they had a dream and wanted so bad to reach it that they felt it was always within one step their grasp. <BR>This book showed the greatness of friendship. I would recommend this book to my friends because it shows the meaning of friendship and patience. This book is about dreams and how important they are in pushing someone to reach them.

B00005JKJA|1.0|I found no redeeming value in this movie.  It starts out ok, and a little intriguing.  ... I stayed until the end in hopes that it would all come together.  Maybe I've been out of college too long to find some inner value, but to me as a middle age college educated professional I found it to be a total waste of my time.  The acting by the two female actresses was good, but Mr. Lynch if this is a masterpiece of your directing, then I would hope that you did not get \\"lynched\\" for your effort.  And, Mr. Theroux (whom I assume wrote the screenplay), what were you \\"taking\\" at the time you wrote this?  Maybe I am too naive to see the redeeming social value of this movie, but I would not recommend any intelligent mainsteam American citizen waste their time on [this]. However, Mr. Lynch, you did catch my attention, for I took the time to review the movie and to write this review.   If I was allowed to rate this \\"zero stars\\", THAT would be my vote!
B00005JKJA|5.0|David Lynch.  Either you love him or hate him, there is no middle ground.  Mulholland Drive is yet another nightmare from the warped mind of David Lynch.  If you liked Twin Peaks or Blue Velvet, and you haven't seen this, you need to see it.  If you enjoyed Lost Highway, enjoyed the tense moments from the most mundane happenings, then by all means, see this movie.  If none of the above really moved you at all, didn't freaked you out, you probably won't enjoy Mulholland Drive.<br />It involves two women, Rita, a bombshell brunette who as a result of a life saving car accident, is an amnesiac.  And Betty, the blonde, naive, idealistic, \\"coming to Hollywood to be discovered\\" stereotype. As the two women struggle to try and decipher Rita's identity, all the work done in the movie for the viewer, character and plot development is almost entirely undone.  It's decipherable, but it's going to take a few viewings.  This is a great movie to watch for those classic Lynch moments, the opening of Rita's purse after she meets Betty, the initial discovery of Diane Selwick, and the entire scene inside Club Silencio.  <br />Lynch was nominated for Best director for this film, again verifying that he is one of the foremost in Avant Garde filmmaking today.  He goes a little easy on us, providing in the inlay, 10 clues for unlocking the mystery of this movie.  Lynch also does one last subtle trick, that i can't help thinking is intentional.  He allows for NO scene selection. He allows only one way to watch this movie, from beginning to end, as one 2 1/2 hour chapter on the dvd.
B0000029DD|4.0|the short review by the person who said that Jeff Buckley's &quot;Grace&quot; was everything that is wrong with music today.  Au contraire, it is everything that is beautiful and right and true and pure and honest and . . . you get the picture.  This cd is incredible, and it continues to grow on me.  I've had it playing consistently since I bought it a week ago.  Buy it and experience the beauty.
6303149200|3.0|This is a typical late 60s/early 70s &quot;horror&quot; film pitting Christianity against paganism. It has some beautiful cinematography, some ok acting, and some of the most ludicrous music in a horror film save for Last House on The Left. In fact, some of the music could easily have fit right into Finian's Rainbow. The ending is affective but predictable, showing the only true horror being man's ability for brutality. The characters are one-dimensional at best, and neither sinister or sympathetic in any way.
B00005JKQX|5.0|Russel Crowe really shines in this movie with professional acting that did the character of Professor Nash justice in revealing the accomplishment of Nash's true story. Not only will Nash be known for his accomplishments in Universities, but his real life in dealing with mental struggles and the complexities it brings to personal relationships, as well as to one's own identity, are brought to notice with heartfelt emotions. Ron Howard was the perfect director to do this piece because he brings integrity and passion to his work. I was so pleased to see him get an Award. I have worked in the Psychology field, and while a movie such \\"As Good As It Gets\\" brings humor to the screen as a result of Mental Illness, \\"A Beautiful Mind\\" displays a more realistic seriousness to the issue that is combated with the greatest medicine humans will always need more of --- Love. :)
B00005YXZH|5.0|Wilco has always been obsessed with the radio and it shows on this album, more than ever before. An affecting hyrbrid of country,pop and Radioheadish eclectic sonic dabbling, Yankee Hotel Foxtrot is a modern masterpiece. It is a brilliant collage of music in the 21st century and the possiblities different sonic experimentation can bring into producing thematic recordings. These are simple songs of longing,loss and resurrection, told as though being broadcasted over the radio. Though the distortion and static that most songs are dispersed with is disaffecting at times, they start to make sense after a couple of listens. This is a loose concept album and can be fully enjoyed only through repeated listening. Great music nonetheless and certainly one of the best this year.
0070511136|5.0|Unlike most developers of sales training, Neil Rackham methodically backs up his claims with in-depth research. To build the flexible, adaptable SPIN model, Rackham has observed and analyzed a large number of high dollar value sales made around the world. Rackham convincingly demonstrates that successful salespeople marketing high dollar value products and services do not rely on the sales tactics geared towards low dollar value sales that are traditionally taught to salespeople. Successful salespeople typically go through four stages that Rackham has identified as: preliminaries, investigating, demonstrating capability, and obtaining commitment.<br />1. In analyzing \\"Preliminaries\\", Rackham first warns salespeople that although first impressions count, they are less important that too many of them imagine. Furthermore, Rackham recommends that salespeople get down to business quickly and avoid talking about solutions too soon. Raising areas of personal interest with buyers can sound suspicious. Talking about the benefit of a solution before understanding buyer's needs and building value to satisfy these needs, can also be an invitation for trouble. Unfortunately, Rackham does not remind his audience enough that this approach to preliminaries, though perfectly appropriate in the American culture, can be perceived as offensive in others. Salespeople doing business abroad beware.<br />2. In looking at the critical \\"Investigating\\", Rackham advises that salespeople not only use situation questions and problem questions but also implication questions and need-payoff questions. Salespeople usually ask the first two types of questions to uncover implied needs unless their customers or prospects tell them upfront that they have an explicit need for a specific solution to their problem(s). In high dollar value sales, salespeople must leverage the uncovered problems to make them bigger by exploring their implications. Buyers can indeed perceive an imbalance between the price of the solution and the severity of their problem(s). Because that type of questioning can sound negative or depressing to buyers, salespeople must follow with need-payoff questions to make their customers or prospects feel good about the proposed solution to their problem(s). To his credit, Rackham reminds his audience that the SPIN model is not a rigid formula. The type of questions to be used and their relative importance depend on the circumstances of the specific high dollar value sale at hand.<br />3. In examining \\"Demonstrating Capability\\", Rackham makes the distinction among features, advantages, and benefits. Rackham convincingly shows that offering benefits is key to meet explicit needs expressed by customers or prospects. Selling only features can be a risky value proposition because that tactic potentially makes customers or prospects more price sensitive than they should be. Resisting that temptation can be particularly daunting in the high tech industry that sometimes suffers from \\"feature creep.\\" Selling only advantages can also backfire against salespeople because that tactic is eventually an invitation to objections raised by customers or prospects. To his credit, Rackham emphasizes objection prevention and not objection resolution by bringing customers or prospects to the insight that the product or service being offered meets the needs expressed by them.<br />4. In investigating \\"Obtaining Commitment\\", Rackham demonstrates with panache that there is an inversely proportional relationship between the number of closing techniques and the success of high dollar value sales. Traditional closing techniques such as assumptive closes, alternative closes, standing-room-only closes, last-chance closes, and order-blank closes can easily generate objections from customers or prospects who are not yet ready to act on their implied and expressed needs. Progress in high dollar value sales is measured in actions on which customers or prospects agree so that salespeople can eventually move on along the continuum stretching from lead to order. As long as customers or prospects do not commit to advancing in that process, salespeople are indeed condemned to stagnation at best, definitive loss of the order at worst down the road.<br />In Appendix A of his book (which is really worth of his audience's attention), Rackham is humble enough to recognize that a jump in sales following one of his sales trainings based on the four-step approach described above can be totally or partially attributed to other factors such as changes in people, changes in products, changes in pricing or changes in competition.<br />Finally, as a side note, a good strategic complement to the tactical \\"SPIN Selling\\" is \\"The New Strategic Selling\\" by Stephen E. Heiman, Diane Sanchez, and Tad Tuleja. Like the former, the latter focuses on high dollar value sales.espeople can eventually move on along the continuum stretching from lead to order.

B00005JKMQ|4.0|I went to this movie with mixed expectations.  Sure, Will Smith is one of my favorite actors, but Ali is one of my least favorite sports celebrities.  That said, this movie was very impressive.  The acting was incredible.  Will Smith was robbed of the best actor, and Jon Voigt does an incredible job as Howard Cosell.  This movie does float around a little, and it's not perfectly paced, but it is great.  Will Smith's performace is perfect.  This DVD will have only a trailer; therefore, it may not be worth purchasing.

On the other hand, this compilation is of paramount interest to those who wish to taste for themselves a band whose music has survived since the late sixties and still remains one of the main foundations of modern rock music.

B00005R62N|5.0|If you've heard the original and thought it was outstanding for its time, you'll agree that it left you wanting more. This remastered version is the way it should've been from the start. The original nine core songs sound amazing, and the four extra live tracks (from the same tour) seamlessly make this album complete, finally. After listening to this release from start to end, you won't remember that once upon a time, it was four tracks shorter. The folks at Legacy (Sony Music) have managed to make of the greatest live rock albums of all time even better. This CD is a MUST HAVE for any Judas Priest or heavy metal fan. Even if you're not into metal, but you're a hard rock fan, you will definitely enjoy the power of the performances captured in this recording.
B00005YXZH|1.0|After reading such rave reviews by fellow amazonians i went out and bought Yankee Hotel Foxtrot. Now i just wish the store would take it back. Apparently the cd i listened to (3 times thru) is not the same one everyone else did. I thought most of the songs sounded like a tabby cat being swung around by its tail. Tracks 4 and 5 were tolerable, but the rest were pretty [junky]. Of course this is just my opinion. But i suggest if you're a Wilco fan that you find another Wilco fan who already made the mistake of buying the cd and give it a listen first. I'd give you my copy, but i threw it out already.
0064409422|5.0|Although modern publishers frequently make \\"The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe\\" the second entry into the \\"Narnia Chronicles\\" series, strictly speaking it is the first, because it is the first book Lewis wrote about the world of Narnia.  Peter, Susan, Edmund and Lucy are busy playing in the huge house of a professor (the grown-up Digory), when they chance upon a wardrobe which turns out to be a doorway into another world: the world of Narnia.  Under the curse of the wicked White Witch, Narnia is experiencing a harsh winter and suffers under her iron rule over the true-hearted creatures of Narnia.  With the help of the delightful Mr. & Mrs. Beaver, the children begin making plans to rescue Narnia.  When Edmund - under the influence of magical Turkish Delight - betrays them to witch, their lives are imperilled.  Only the vital intervention of the great Lion Aslan can rescue the children - and all of Narnia - from the cold curse of the witch.  This he does by means of a terrible sacrifice, and subsequent victory in a decisive battle involving all the creatures of Narnia.<br />As with all the Narnia Chronicles, on the level of children the story functions as a perfectly comprehensible and exciting fantasy adventure, but on an adult level it imparts powerful spiritual truths about Christianity by means of numerous recognizable Biblical allusions.  In \\"The Lion the Witch and the Wardrobe\\" there are allusions to Satan's deceptive schemes in promising mankind kingship over the world, as well as to the death and resurrection of Christ as a substitutionary atonement in saving sinners from Satan (p.165ff).  This cannot be regarded as a strict allegory, because otherwise one will be quick to point out its shortcomings (in Scripture it is God's justice, not Satan, that Christ must make a \\"deal\\" with).  But Lewis plainly uses the great lion Aslan as a symbol of Jesus Christ.  Meeting Aslan evokes a sense of awe, fear and delight (p.86), because he is \\"both terrible and good\\" (p.140ff), paralleling the holiness and mercy of the only Saviour Jesus Christ.<br />As always, in all the upheavals and conflicts of Narnia, Aslan is the one constant, and it is his vital involvement that enables the children to complete their Narnian quest, just as it is Christ who inspires, comforts, guides, and saves in the real world. Narnia may exist only in Lewis imagination and ours, but these underlying truths about Christ ensure that a journey to Narnia is never without profit for the real world..140ff), paralleling the holiness and mercy of the only Saviour Jesus Christ.<br />As always, in all the upheavals and conflicts of Narnia, Aslan is the one constant, and it is his vital involvement that enables the children to complete their Narnian quest, just as it is Christ who inspires, comforts, guides, and saves in the real world.

B00005YXZH|5.0|This is truly a singular and amazing work of art.  Following up the lush pop of \\"Summerteeth\\" seems a daunting task to put it mildly, yet this CD is easily the band's best.  Being lucky enough to see Jeff Tweedy play live acoustically a few times over the past eighteen months, I was able to hear many of these songs in their \\"stripped-down\\" form and I was slightly concerned that the studio production might taint my opinion of these great new songs.  Gladly, the finished product is even better than I could have hoped, incorporating the best aspects of both \\"A.M.\\" and \\"Being There\\".  Buy this CD immediately as it just proves the staying power and innovation of America's greatest band.
6304712936|4.0|This film was meant to be a subjective piece on the relationship between Mozart and Salieri based on Peter Shaffer's play.  Casting was intentionally done to bring unknowns onboard.  F. Murray Abraham (who plays Salieri) and Tom Hulce (who plays Mozart) have never played on a piano before, let alone conduct an orchestra.  For their parts, though, they did train and eventually learn to play the piano and look the part of a composer.  After watching F. Murray Abraham's performance I utterly reviled Salieri.  I pitied Mozart.  Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart, the child prodigy who died in a pauper's grave.  It is such a tragedy.  How could one man have so much hatred for another that his goal in life is to ruin his enemy, and claim that this is god's fault?  Well, it is possible after you watch this film.<br />This DVD is split onto 2 sides of one disc.  There's a Side 1 and Side 2.  It also contains a Special Features section which is entirely full of text (available from the Menu on either side).  I was disappointed by the lack of truly special features such as extra footage or director commentaries.  It's a long (160 minutes) film and to cap off this DVD with a lot of narrative text is anti-climactic.<br />I would be interested in seeing another edition of this DVD come out which further draws the audience into this film.  But for now, this will have to do.  I highly recommend the story, though the medium needs improvement.<br />LEAP rating (each out of 5):<br />============================<BR>L (Language) - 4.5 (engaging dialogue)<BR>E (Erotica) - 0 (sadly, none)<BR>A (Action) - 0 (n/a)<BR>P (Plot) - 4 (a well-conceived opinionated retelling of a slice of history)

B00003CWTI|5.0|I loved this movie. It deals with so much that it probably could have been divided into several different films. I find that movies that have a lot of characters and a lot of factors involved are among the best. Unfortunately it did not win Best Picture even though it is a more powerful film that American Beauty was. Of course you're going to hear in other reviews how the ending sequence was stupid while I tend to disagree. How else would these people have been brought together? A very different and original way for a climax of a film and I can guarantee you that you will think that it is very cool. I also loved the way the film was directed.<BR>     The DVD however was a bit of a downer compared to other 2-disc Platinum Series DVD's like Se7en. There's around 100 minutes of bonus material but no commentary which would have been very interesting. I guess the 75 minute documentary takes its place. Other recommendations: Vanilla Sky &amp; Boogie Nights.

B000002KFJ|5.0|... Not bad for the Fred Flintstone of the 21st century, but \\"Sabotage\\" is so good, I'd take it to that proverbial desert island to remind me when metal bands had a gigantic clue, and weren't afraid to use it. I just love the way this record sucks the unsuspecting headbanger into a false sense of comfort with a standard dinosaur stomp (\\"Hole in the Sky\\") and some natty classical noodling by Toni Iommi (a trick much beloved by disciple Eddie Van Halen) before setting off for new planets with \\"Symptom of the Universe,\\" a speedmetal prototype that makes like a funny car on rocket fuel until two-thirds of the way through the proceedings when it suddenly downshifts into a shambling outtake from Neil Young's \\"Harvest\\" or maybe mid-period Jethro Tull, rural country comforts about as far from metal as a rabbit's foot. Magnum opus \\"Meglomania\\" follows, Ozzy chanting strange Druid fragments from across the runes while the band swirls telepsychopathically around him. Once the listener is safely tucked into the Stonehenge groove, a bordello piano break cues a bouncy Blue Oyster Cult riff-o-rama with Ozzy gleefully barking words of wisdom along the lines of \\"sting me/suck me/breeeeeathe!\\" until the orchestra finally kicks in. Seriously. And that's just side one. \\"The Thrill of It All\\" starts off with typical menace (are you catching the trend here?) and evolves into a sprightly power-pop romp, then \\"Supertzar\\" enlists Satan's choir for an outtake from \\"The Omen\\" that would become Sabbath's stage-intro soundtrack for the rest of eternity. And if that weren't enough, \\"Am I Going Insane (Radio)\\" invents a strain of synth-pop (?!?) that infected an entire generation of British lads like Gary Numan. Finally, \\"The Writ\\" loops the proceedings back to more typical Sabboid sludgecore, thus helping the hapless listener forget that his perception of the genre has been permanently dain-bramaged (sample lyric: \\"what kind of people do you think we are/another joker who's a rock and roll star/for you/just for you\\"). The band never sounded better, with the bottomless-pit production of their primal primary efforts enhanced by a sleek-n-chic approach that includes a firm grip on the (gasp) treble knob of Tony Iommi's guitar. It's also important to note it was the first (and last) time they appeared on an album cover (and given their hilarious period garb, we understand why Sharon insists on dressing them today). Right up there with ZOSO, Van Halen's debut, Machine Head and Billion Dollar Babies. You'll never be able to listen to \\"Iron Man\\" with a straight face again.
B000056N8X|4.0|This out with the old (and lets face it Chris, you're getting old) attempt to turn Highlander over from the traditional Christopher Lambert movie series to Adrian Paul has a good story and acting; however it does deviate a bit from the traditional story line to be more like the television series. It also paints a poor picture of Connor as somehow being weaker willed due to his long and hard encounters. If you are a true Highlander fan you must have this to complete your collection; however, the 1st and 3rd Highlanders are still the best. Best in story, acting, and casting.
6305736650|5.0|A vast majority of filmgoers have acclaimed \\"Casablanca\\" as a classic. The small minority usually dislikes it for the black and white photography, the long since deceased stars, the lack of car chases and the characters bad habits (Drinking and smoking were very common in the 1940's). Many of the scenes in this film have also become so paroided that people have probably seen the spoof before they see the actual scene (Don't get this film's ending confused with the `alternate version' used on the \\"The Simpsons\\").  I do agree with the majority vote, but I do so for a reason as well. Here is a list on \\"What makes 'Casablanca' a classic\\". <br />Values. This film shows that there are causes worth fighting for and that are worth sacrificing for. You have to take a stand on what you know is right and wrong, even if it means giving up something valuable to you or giving up your life <br />Patriotism. Though not all of us think of \\"La Marseilles\\" as our national anthem, that scene in the movie reminded us that pride in one's country could be a most powerful weapon. If I were in the same room with Osama Bin Laden, I would torture him by singing \\"The Star Spangled Banner\\". <br />Characters. Many words have already been written about Humphrey Bogart as Rick Blaine and Ingrid Bergman as Ilsa Lund. What about Paul Heinreid as Victor Lazlo, Claude Rains as Captain Renault or Conrad Veidt as Major Strasser? What about Sydney Greenstreet as Senior Ferrari, Peter Lorre as Ugarte, Dooley Wilson as Sam and S.Z Sazkall as Carl? Each of these characters has an important part and-Along with the ones discussed in the next paragraph-only add to the film. <br />Authenticity. The actors and extras in this movie are able to create a convincing environment that resembles French Morocco, unlike some films at the time which made up white actors to unconvincingly look like foreigners. This can be attributed to the large number of refugees that fled to America at the time. Many of the people in this film went through the same experience of running away from their homelands as their characters in this film do, further adding depth to the film. Some people in the audience can also relate to the events and experience these persons go through, like running away from home and having to stay on your feet or watch your back every minute. <br />The screenwriters on this film (Julius and Philip Epstein and Howard Koch) were responsible for the great dialogue and scenes that are affecting, hilarious and dramatic, sometimes all at once. But it was the director (Michael Curtiz) and actors who avoided making them throwaway lines. For example, after Rick shoots Major Strasser, Captain Renault states \\"Major Strasser has been shot\\", than takes a glance at Rick as he decides what to do. Than he says \\"Round up the usual suspects\\" to the guards. The line would have still been good if he had said it immediately afterward, but it wouldn't have been so emphasized. <br />Another thought I had was in the feelings Rick and Ilsa have for one another. Though, when they were in Casablanca, they still had something for each other, the fire wasn't as intense as seen during the Paris flashback. It's also possible that Rick and Ilsa might have only slept together in Casablanca so Ilsa could get Rick to help her and Victor. Certainly a far cry from the way it was in Paris. If the film had ended with Ilsa leaving Victor for Rick, Ilsa would not only be in danger but she and Rick might not have been as happy with one another (Not to forget that the film would be regarded today as a message to leave your spouse for someone you had a one night stand with). <br />Finally, this movie is just so darn fun to watch. But while it works at straightforward value, many people have nevertheless come up with unusual interpretations. One has the film being a political allegory of the time, with Rick as FDR ('Casa Blanca' is Spanish for 'White House'). Another idea has the ending being a gay fantasy, with Rick dumping Ilsa to have an affair with another man, that being Captain Renault (Bogart does have more screentime with Rains and there is the line \\"Rick is the kind of man that, if I were a woman, I shall be in love with Rick\\"). The best thing that can be said about both theories is that they are creative. <br />No movie, in my opinion, is absolutely perfect. There is also no `Greatest movie of all time' in my view. <br />However, \\"Casablanca\\" does come close to being both. This film also achieves something that few movies do: It improves with age. Indeed, as time goes by, I will enjoy returning to Rick's more and more.

Just about everything you want to hear from Wings is here, including \\"Jet\\" and the title cut to the group's signature album, \\"Band on the Run.\\"  \\"Bluebird\\" is also on, serving as the first in a sequence of four pretty songs, the last three of which are Beatles numbers:  \\"I've Just Seen A Face,\\" \\"Blackbird,\\" and \\"Yesterday,\\" which my college music teacher called \\"the greatest chamber music of the 20th Century.\\"  The other Beatles entries are \\"Lady Madonna\\" and \\"The Long and Winding Road,\\" giving Paul the satisfaction of the absence of the Spector-laden effects of choir and strings.  Paul carries the crowd in \\"Hi, Hi, Hi\\"-- really makes you wish you were there for such a cool song.  The James Bond theme \\"Live and Let Die,\\" very rousing and (sort of) menacing as well as one of my favorite Wings songs, and \\"My Love\\" are also highlights, pun intended.  However, Paul's latter-day tendency for more lightweight instrumental/lyrical work is also represented, in \\"Silly Love Songs\\" and \\"Let 'Em In.\\"  The top moment, as always, is \\"Maybe I'm Amazed,\\" Paul's best song ever along with \\"All My Loving\\" (yes, including \\"Yesterday\\").
0425098478|5.0|This was a very interesting book. I recently became a manager at my place of work and now have an idea of what my company is looking for me to do without even asking how I should manage. This book will stay with me for the rest of my life.
B000000XB9|4.0|Creedence Clearwater Revival had a great sound.  This is coming from someone who generally does not like country and rockabilly.  It is true that many country rock groups had some R&B influences, but Creedence will always be a rock group to me.  They clearly had the basic rock structure in their songs--verseline and chorus--and they delivered potent music.  Individual songs are marked by a good driving beat and bass line, and they are very catchy.  The songwriting and the songs are just plain good--John Fogerty had a great band.<br />This collection includes all the classics, the big hits.  I'll always remember \\"Down on the Corner\\" as the effective title cut of \\"Willy & The Poorboys,\\" the first LP I purchased, in which the group got into social commentary.  But for the most part, Creedence had country lyrics with a great rock sound.  \\"Proud Mary\\" is CCR's most well-known song, but the other big pop numbers are all here, such as \\"Travelin' Band,\\" \\"Bad Moon Risin',\\" and \\"Have You Ever Seen the Rain.\\"  \\"Run Through the Jungle\\" is more intense, and one of my favorites, with those deep riffs and the foreboding atmosphere.  \\"Green River\\" has a neat, steady-driving beat.  A nice bonus is an extended version of the group performing Marvin Gaye's \\"I Heard It Through the Grapevine.\\"  CCR produced some of the heart of American rock and roll, and was the top group in the country for a brief period.  Thus, \\"20 Greatest Hits\\" is essential.

B000002GFC|5.0|This collection is a must for fans of Clapton, Bruce, and Baker and the great rock of the late 60s.  It is a wonderful return to blues-lined psychedelia.  The second track is \\"I Feel Free,\\" follow the lead.  The included songs are just too good for me to rate them below five stars.  Cream were the masters of soloing and the live jam, so take a walk down to the \\"Crossroads.\\"  Disraeli Gears, with its psychedelic (hallucinogenic?) cover, carries such strong memories.  I'll always remember \\"Swlabr,\\" notwithsanding the mouthful of a title, for the neat, catchy verseline and lyrics, comin' to me when I wanted.  And that classic guitar signature of \\"Sunshine of Your Love,\\" one of rock's all-time great motifs.  It may be the best song, but what about \\"Badge\\" and the tingling psychedelia of \\"White Room,\\" perhaps the group's most quintessential song, anyway.  It's all here, a \\"Spoonful\\" of blues and \\"Sweeet Wine\\" and a \\"Strange Brew,\\" and then those great guitar riffs to \\"Tales of Brave Ulysses.\\" Setting aside a few really big names, Cream is my favorite 60s group, ever so cool.  \\"Riding in my car, smoking a cigar, only time I'm happy's when I'm playin' my guitar.\\"  Do it up!!!!
B00005JKJA|4.0|After the ridiculously good Straight Story, Lynch has gone back to his old bag of tricks.  That isn't a bad thing of course.  No filmmaker has ever been able to make a film seem like a dream like Lynch.  He seems to be able to make it seem surreal without even trying.  His view of Hollywood as a dark, twisted, skewed netherworld coincides with this dream-like journey.  The suns out but its dark everywhere.  It didn't surprise me to learn that this was once an ABC TV pilot, the first 100 minutes are engaging stuff that I would have tuned in to see.  Its got the patented Lynch weirdness, the espresso scene is just so bizarre that I couldn't help but laugh.  Also the [messed]-up murder was morbidly humorous.  The sequence in the beginning in the coffee shop is why I love Lynch, it is a dream, it is so disturbing without actually being disturbing, its the atmosphere, its indescribable, and I'm becoming a meandering pretentious loon. The \\"narrative\\" involves Rita and Betty, Rita is suffering from amnesia which sounds contrived but this is Lynch and it doesn't matter.  They form a common bond and their quest to find out who Rita really is had me [pulled] in.  They navigate the twisted landscape of Hollywood together.  The other main player is a director who looks suspiciously like Steven Soderbergh or at least the glasses make it look that way.  The events that transpire don't really conjoin, just exist.  But what everyone talks about is the ending, where everything becomes a free-for-all of identity exchange, lesbianism, and violence.  It doesn't make sense, and no sense is supposed to be made I guess.  I just sat back and watched it all unfold, not really caring about the ending because I knew it wouldn't make sense.  I could probably come to some conclusion about the meaning of it all, but everyone should come up with their own.  And that is why Lynch is such an essential filmmaker, no one will ever do it like he does, and no one ever has.  People can debate the meaning of his films for all of eternity and never agree, and that alone makes this film a worthwhile entry in the Lynch legacy.
0385505833|4.0|Certainly a departure from the \\"normal\\" Grisham fare, this nice little Christmas story, easily read in an hour and a half, has a little more substance than we expected.  It's about a stereotypical suburban couple, the Kranks (which for a while we thought was a pun), who make the brash decision to forego Christmas in all of its trappings -- gift exchanges, office parties, house lights and adornments, card sending, tree decorations, etc, etc -- and instead spend far less money to cruise the Caribbean for 10 days.  The pressure from the neighbors, office staff, friends, traditional \\"gift\\" receivers like the firemen and such, is so enormous they almost buckle, but their steadfast hold on their decision for the first half of the book gives more than ample pause to examine the familiar traps we may similarly have fallen into ourselves.<br />Then an unexpected development with their daughter, supposedly in the Peace Corps in Peru and out of sight for at least a year, plays havoc with their plans.  The outcome and resolution is hilarious at first, then somewhat heartwarming, to put quite a twist on a story one was hardly sure of its direction.<br />We thought it to be a highly entertaining book and quite a nice change of pace for Mr. Grisham who seems to (ala A Painted House) want to expand away from his normal stomping grounds.  We imagine he sold a bazillion of these books, but if you missed it somehow, it's a fine read and would itself make a nice holiday gift!
0312979479|5.0|As an avid Agatha Christie reader, this book is my personal favorite. It combines an eerie children's rhyme with the methodical yet unbelievable murder of 10 random people stranded on an island. After each page, your opinion will change about who the culprit is and the ending is definitely a complete shocker. I encourage any mystery fan to read this book- i guarantee that you will thoroughly enjoy it!
0452282152|5.0|Tracey Chevalier's novel is one that is genius and intriguing. Set in Denmark in the 1600's, the story of a young girl forced to be a maid to support her family unfolds. Not only does Chevalier capture the reader through the life of the main character Griet, she also introduces the reader to extremely important minor characters that help make the story. This is a novel that is well worth the read, I could not put it down.
B000002GYI|4.0|There is so much sampled Kraftwerk in dance, trance and hip hop that I am sure the boys from Berlin (ok Dusseldorf) make more in royalties now than they did when actively making disks.<br />Computer World is both hypnotic and human.  The machines dominate, yet the human quality is always just below the surface.<br />There is a spartan, tutonic edge to everything, with not a not or phrase out of place, however there is also a &quot;relentlessness&quot; and edge that does not show up in other Kraftwerk albums, almost as if the machines were on the edge of overrunning the humans - which is perhaps the true theme of the album.<br />The quality of the recording in amazingly good, and absolutely stunning for 1981.  I personally like &quot;Man Machine&quot; a bit better than Computer World, however both are exceptional albums.<br />After hearing Computer World you will suddenly see how many other bands were inspired by their world - they are, and this word is overused - seminal artists in the truest sense.
B00005YXZH|1.0|This is what Sting would sound like if he were born in Arkansas.  Simply put, Yankee Hotel Foxtrot is awful.  I should have steered clear when I started seeing comparisons to Radiohead, but I was suckered by the positive reviews.  Once upon a time, alternative music, and alt-country especially, could be relied on for simple pleasures, and at some point things would start to rock.  No more.  Lyrics are almost unrelentingly morose, melodies are virtually non-existent, and you get the feeling that no one enjoyed making this music, nor do they want you to enjoy listening to it.  We have gone from No Depression to All Depression.  Jay Bennett didn't leave the band because of this music.  He lapsed into a boredom-induced coma while listening to the tapes and is still asleep under a desk somewhere.  I beg you... don't encourage these people.  Go buy a used Bottle Rockets CD instead.    Hey!  I just found out that Wilco was sued for using the \\"Yankee Hotel Foxtrot\\" soundbite without permission.  As a result, they had to fork over a large sum of money to the owner.  So, something good came out of this dreck after all - kinda like finding a quarter at the bottom of a portajon.  The soundbite is from a 4CD collection called \\"The CONET Project.\\"  The discs consist of recordings of short wave \\"number stations\\" - mechanical voices repeating numbers to no discernible purpose.  It's a great collection, and a million times more interesting than this disc.
B000002UB6|3.0|This album has some good songs, but it also has some uninspired performances from the Beatles. &quot;Get Back&quot; is the highlight for me, while &quot;The Long and Winding Road&quot; is a low point, both for Phil Spector's string and choral overdubs, and for it being a bit of a mawkish lounge song. Like the &quot;white album&quot;, the Beatles do seem like one another's sidemen rather than a cohesive band. However, unlike that album, this is not an all-time classic. If you're just starting out buying Beatles, don't start here.
B00005U1YO|5.0|as soon as you start listening to this CD, you'll get into deep trance. they were good, but now they are even better in taking you to the other side. great percussion.  i believe this is their best album.
B000002UAR|5.0|This is my favorite Beatles album and probably my favorite album period. When I first heard this, it was the American vinyl edition, and it was missing &quot;Dr Robert&quot;, &quot;And Your Bird Can Sing&quot; and &quot;I'm Only Sleeping&quot; (these were stuck on a U.S. album called &quot;Yeseterday &amp; Today&quot;). All three are John Lennon songs, and as he was my favorite Beatle, I thought his presence was lacking. Fortunately, when the Beatles catalog was issued on cd, the British configurations were used, and my love of this album went up a few notches. This is not to knock the contributions of the other Beatles. Paul McCartney's songs are among his best, George Harrison has three tunes for the first time on a Beatles album and the Ringo Starr sung &quot;Yellow Submarine&quot; has become his trademark. Musically &amp; lyrically, this album is all over the place but put together makes a concise unit. Psychedelia, folk-rock, soul, classical and even childrens' music all influenced the fabs on this one. The lyrics are at times funny, sad, weird, hypnotic, joyous or melancholy. Under a lesser talent, this would have seemed to be the work of about 6 or 7 differnt artists, but every tune manages to identify itself as a &quot;Beatles' song&quot; while maintaining it's own identity. Know what I mean? If not, check this CD out!
B00000JGHM|5.0|Heat is one of my all-time favorites.  Checking in at a lengthy 2 hours and 52 minutes, Heat is full of story, full of action, full of menace and full of great, great music.  Not many reviewers mention this, but the score is fantastic, the perfect accompaniment (except for one weak track leading into Al Pacino's meeting with Tone Loc in a night club, the low point of an otherwise fantastic movie).  Even if you don't watch it for any other reason, watch it for the incredible and extensive running gun battle through the streets of LA, filmed before a similar rampage occurred years later in a case of life imitating art.<br />Robert De Niro as Neil leads a crew of professional criminals (Kilmer, Sizemore, Trejo) operating under the radar in the LA area.  That is, until they employ some extra muscle for an armored car heist in the form of one Waingro.  Turns out Waingro is a bit unbalanced, and can't help himself from killing one of the armored car guards; this forces a shootout that results in the death of the other guards, and subsequently attracts the attention of Al Pacino's LAPD detective Vincent Hannah and his own crew (Williamson, Studi, Levine et al).<br />The film's title comes from Neil's proclaimed modus operandi; don't keep anything in your life that you can't walk away from in 30 seconds if you feel the heat around the corner.  Thus his house has no furniture, but metaphorically neither does his soul.  He claims that he is alone, not lonely, but his eyes tell a different story as he observes Chris, Michael and Danny (Kilmer, Sizemore, Trejo) and their loved ones at a dinner.  They all betray his philosophy, as will he.<br />The parallels between the lives of Neil and Vince are remarkable and moving.  The detectives night on the town with their own families is less formal and glamorous than that of the criminals, and when Vince flee the storm of his third failed marriage, the only possession he claims as his own is a...little television set.  The degrees of separation between the cops and the robbers are few but extreme.<br />After the armored car job, De Niro's crew feels so much heat that the soles of their shoes are melting.  They just can't resist the lure of one more job together, however, a bank hit for some 12 million dollars; the need for this big score is driven primarily by gambling debts incurred by Val Kilmer's character Chris.  They resist several opportunities and warnings to slip away from LA and Vince, committing themselves to a potential final showdown.<br />You'll recognize many familiar faces in Heat, namely Al Pacino, Robert De Niro, Val Kilmer, Tom Sizemore, John Voight, Ashley Judd, Danny Trejo (Con Air), Mykelti Williamson (Forest Gump), Wes Studi (Last of the Mohicans), Ted Levine (Silence of the Lambs), Natalie Portman, Hank Azaria, Tom Noonan (Manhunter), William Fichter (Perfect Storm), Henry Rollins, Amy Brenneman, and even Jeremy Piven sporting an awesome `70s porn star moustache as Doctor Bob.  Almost everyone involved turns in a good performance, no real complaints unless you can't stand Pacino's typical over the top antics or Tone Loc's boorish gangster.  I give Heat my highest recommendation.eparation between the cops and the robbers are few but extreme.<br />After the armored car job, De Niro's crew feels so much heat that the soles of their shoes are melting.

B00003CX8V|5.0|Lemmon and MacLaine are great in this movie.  It's adorable, sad, and funny.  It's also great to see an old-style office.  I loved it.  This is the perfect movie for a quiet evening in lieu of a book.   It's a classic that any fan of Lemmon, MacLaine, or Wilder should own.  You can't watch it just once.
B00000JPH6|2.0|I bought this for my twins... We have many movies and dvds.  I was expecting great things based on the reviews (I mostly relied on reviews because I don't remember seeing it or people talking about it...now I know why!)  My kids didn't like the puppets.  I, who grew up with Jim Henson (and Kroft.. and all the other weird 70's stuff) thought it was kind of stupid, too.  The themes (save your race/species) were too advanced for young kids and the dialog and characters were too boring for older kids/adults.  Bummer.  I was really hoping for more than this.  I think one of the best things about a kids movie is that it is good enough for the adults to like, too.  We don't watch it at all.  Stick with Mary Poppins, Toy Story, Shrek, The (original Disney) Jungle Book, Nightmare before Christmas, etc. these are classics for a reason.

B00005KHJR|5.0|This movie has often been called the \\"Citizen Kane\\" of horror films. But I wouldn't describe it as a horror film. It is like an Irish musical, mysterious whodunit, pagan drama and a suspense-filled, erotic allegory of the age-old srtuggle between Paganism and Christianity. Coming from a Christian's perspective, I found it to be an allegory of Paganism versus Christianity without taking either side. Although the Christian was a total (expletive of your choice here), I never found myself wanting to abandon my beliefs and become a pagan. This movie has some incredible moments, like Britt Ekland's song and the \\"Landlord Daughter\\" number. The ending is almost like watching Unbreakable or The Sixth Sense where there's that moment you finally realize it all. There is some nudity, brief sexuality and mild language if any. If you've never seen it, you must.
B0000025ZK|4.0|While in parts this album sounds \\"Floydian\\", David Gilmour here actually resists the temptation to \\"sound like Floyd\\" and allows his own talents, including the melodicism and the musicianship he brought to Pink Floyd, to shine in this solo effort. Actually after a few listens I find this to be almost as good as \\"classic\\" Floyd albums such as \\"Animals\\" and \\"The Wall\\"- and although it is not as ambitious or as literate as those works, it is also more instantly accessible and enjoyable. Even the much maligned \\"Blue Light\\" is decent, while songs like \\"Murder\\" and \\"Love on the Air\\" have great melodies and great guitar solos too. This album is also better than the records \\"his\\" Pink Floyd lineup would subsequently record. While Gilmour certainly contibuted much to the Floyd and shows it well here, he seems to do better when not trying to do his version of a Floyd record. Unfortunately, since this record does not appear under the \\"Pink Floyd\\" label, it was (and is) overlooked.
B00005OAIE|5.0|This is a real find.  John Mayer's voice is amazing.  His songs are catchy and the lyrics, evocative.  If you're looking for something new and different, this is it.  I haven't been this excited about a cd since New Radicals a few years back.  Mayer is sure to soon be discovered by the masses.
B000002KDI|5.0|Neil Young is my favorite artist and this is one of my favorite albums by him.  Though he has too many great works to appear on one album, this shows many facets of Neil Young, 16 songs, while at the same time being very enjoyable to listen to.  It starts out with some of his great acoustic works and moves into some of his heavy grungy stuff giving off the energy of being at a live show.<BR>He takes us down lifes roads with songs like I Am A Child and Comes A Time, Lotta Love, ect., then thru more serious songs like The Needle and the Damage Done, Powderfinger, Cortez the Killer, and then hits it hard with classics like Cinnamon Girl (a rocking fantasy), Like a Hurricane, Hey Hey, My My (Into the Black), Tonight's the Night.  As diverse a sample this is, it flows together like a charm and is probably the best live album I've heard. -Steve Anderson
B00000J7JO|5.0|I wasn't a huge Chili Peppers fan until this album. You can listen to this albums hundreds of times and like it more each time you listen to it, without a doubt.

B00005RHGK|3.0|I'll start by saying this is definetly not one of the best movies by a long shot, but it is still worth seeing at least once.  Most people I know either love Jeepers Creepers, or hate it with a passion, but I'm kind of in the middle.  The villain is one of the best I've seen in a movie in a long time, and is very entertaining.  This movie, unlike most horror movies these days, is actually pretty scary and will give you that creepy feel that everybody loves.  I recommend renting it before you buy it, but it is overall a pretty good movie.
B00005JH7D|5.0|The Grammy Award winning album M^2 (M Squared) which was released in the summer of 2001 is an excellent album for jazz/r&amp;b listeners and especially for bassists.  Marcus Miller is undoubtedly one of the best, if not the best bassist today. He also plays sax and bass clarinet on his albums and live shows. Marcus Miller's style is a fusion of funk, hip-hop, jazz and rock. His slap-funk style is what influences and inspires many of today's bassists. The Marcus Miller band also features drummer Poogie Bell.  Together, this rhythm section seduces listeners to groove to the rhythm. <br />\\"M Sqaured\\" can be considered the best Marcus Miller album to date.  The blend of elements of funk and jazz really attracts listeners.  Marcus Miller's compositions have come a long way from his earlier albums.  \\"Power,\\" \\"Boomerang,\\" and \\"Nikki's Groove\\" are a few of the excellent tracks on this album.  However, undoubtedly the best song on this album is \\"Power.\\"  Marcus' improvisation along with Poogie laying down the rhythm behind the beat show's the musicianship of Marcus along with the other studio musicians.  \\"M Squared\\" is an album where you can't go wrong.
B00005U18E|5.0|Pride and Prejudice is one of my favorite classics.  I thought this movie did a very good modernization of the book.  It was wonderfully funny and romantic.  I loved the ending.  I could watch it again and again.
B00005K3NR|5.0|\\"They're called breasts mama, every woman has em\\".  This film is not only filled with great lines but it is scary in a mental sort of way and satirical to boot.  This DVD is what DVD should be, not bare-boned but full of great making of stuff.  The only negative is I truly wanted to see the deleted scene of Carrie as a little girl and the stone storm.
B00005JKED|1.0|Although Russell Crowe is a talented actor I was really hoping Denzel would take home the Oscar that he deserved.  After watching this movie, I was saddened that it was for such a horrible role.  This was one of the worst movies I have ever seen.  Russell Crowe did have a lot of controversary around him at the time of the votes, his performance as John Nash was far superior to Denzel in this movie.  I realize Denzel got the award more for his body of work however, it's really sad that they gave him the Oscar for such a poor role.
B00004W5UA|5.0|Fight Club which is stared mainly by: Edward Norton, Bradd Pitt and Hellna Bonham Carter, is one of the best movies that been made in past few years.<BR>not because of its impressive visuals, not because of its good acting, not because of its flowing plot and smart text.<BR>Its because of the idea behind its plot, the plot of the movie is the kind that developed with mach thought throughout the movie.<BR>Things that you couldn't see or didn't take mach notice of you understand as you see the movie.<br />This movie also takes use of ideas of some philosophers that tried to make people question things throughout time.<BR>Fight club tries to make people question their society and their ways of living.<BR>This movie is being repesented by the same people it critic and thing that makes it even more special.<BR>In conclusion i recomend this movie to anyone that likes to watch good movies.

You can feel the love in Your Song and Le Tango De Roxanne will make you feel the pain and sorrow that Christian and Satine are going through. Kidman and McGregor have wonderful voices.<br />My favorite songs are Nature Boy which sets the mood for the whole movie, Your Song which shows the love between Christian and Satine, Le Tango de Roxanne which shows the raw emotion of jealousy, and Complainte de la Butte. <br />The weakest point would have to be Lady Marmalade. I like the song, but it really doesn't fit the mood or the story that well. Although it is in the movie, it isn't like it is on the soundtrack. <br />I recommend this for anyone even if you didn't like the movie!
0792841344|5.0|I wanted to let you know that the estimate shipping for that DVD movie was great and it came in within 5 days!  I watched that movie and I rate it all 5 stars and I love that movie.  I will be planning to buy Phantasm 4 and other horror movies.  Thanks so much for great Amazon website and it's business.  I rate Amazon number one shopping center!  Thanks!
B00002MZ4V|5.0|This 2-disc compilation is an excellent anthology of William's best music for the movies, covering his work from the 60's to 1999. The first track on disc 1 is of course, Star Wars, with one of the most memorable scores ever written for film. Then we are taken throughout the brilliant work Williams did for E.T (1982), Superman (1978), Jaws (1975) and Raiders of the Lost Ark. With each track, the memories of the films come back, as does the excitement of listening this music for the first time.<br />Disc 2 consists of William's more recent work, (albeit 1941) with Hook, Home Alone (delightfully spooky) Jurassic Park and The Phantom Menace. Also amongst the collection are quieter tracks, including the excellent Schindler's List, Saving Private Ryan, Rosewood, Far and Away, and Born on the Fourth of July. With each different track, different types of emotion emerge. From Raiders, there is the heroic march, one of William's best, the terror of Jaws, the emotional pull of Schindler, the rousing 1941 and the poetic (Close Encounters of the Third Kind). The only tracks that are absent are his excellent score for The Cowboys and the loud but fun The Lost World. Regardless, this compilation of music from the greatest composer ever is excellent.
B000001ABD|4.0|This is a great cd with most of stevie wonders hits.The 3 hits missing on this cd are :              1.Isnt She Lovely                   2.Golden Lady                       3.Dont You Worry Bout A Thing     I can not understand why these 3 great songs were not included.      Who picks the songs ? I need to talk to stevie myself.
B00005NWM3|4.0|This second cd by Nickelback is a great cd.  It is about time a band like this got some national attention.  I can always listen to this cd straight through...which I'm doing right now.  I must admit though, it is not quite as good as their first album, The State.  If you don't have that one, you need to pick it up before you get this one.
0812550757|5.0|After reading this book, all I can say is WOW!!! This one takes the cake!  I think that both Orson Scott Card's novels Ender's Game and Speaker for the Dead are both excellently written.  The thing I love about this book is that the plot is so twisted until the very end, when everything comes together perfectly.  He also had a great ending, which sets this novel up for the final book in the Ender's trilogy.  All of the books in the trilogy are excellent, but this was probably my favorite of them all, although Ender's Game was thrilling.  If you haven't read this book, I must say this is quite an impressive novel...I couldn't put it down.  The characters are easy to fall in love with, and the setting is so impressive, but I really liked the plot.  It was so ingenious!  How does Card do it time after time?  I strongly recommend this book if you are looking for some good reading.  It was very enjoyable.  So, remember...when you are looking for a book, THIS ONE TAKES THE CAKE!
0807205567|5.0|Sabriel, by Garth Nix, grabbed me by the throat and didn't let go until the bitter end.  I can easily say that this is above and beyond my favorite book.  A well-developed, remarkably human Sabriel had me truly believing in the Charter Runes, just as Anee Rice had me checking my neck for twin scars and Tolkien had me searching for hobbit-holes.  Nix is a writer of that top-notch caliber that makes the reader believe that this is a true story, that while Kerrigor may never have stormed Wyverly College, the Nine Gates are there, murky water swirling about, concealing nameless terrors.  I wholeheartedly recommend this book to anyone, not just fantasy lovers.  I have read it countless times, and it just keeps getting better.
B00004Z459|4.0|Linkin Park's debut CD, Hybrid Theory is an awesome rap/rock CD. Personally I am a huge rap/rock fan. The lyrics for the songs are great and the rapping is also very cool. The best songs on this CD are In The End, Crawling, One Step Closer and With You. I think this CD is great, but like all CD's it has its problems. The songs off of this CD are way overplayed, especially In The End. Also nearly every song on the CD sounds exactly the same. In every one Chester (the lead singer) yells his head off while there is funky rap-music in the background. The lyrics and music is basically the same in all of the songs. All of them start out soft and then get very loud and hard. All in all this is a great CD, but it is not worthy of all the praise it has been getting from radio stations. The songs are great, but just overplayed. If you are a rock/rap fan who wants some great music I reccomend checking out this CD.
1577311523|5.0|Being a retired counselor/therapist I have followed the teachings of Carl Justav Jung much of my professional career. The idea of \\"synchronicity\\" has had a grand influence on my thinking. I once ended up at a community in County Donegal in Northern Ireland as the result of synchronous events. And I found out that many others had been directed there as well, without being aware that they would end up there - as I did. <br />I have been a \\"seeker\\" most of my life but, alas, I have been mostly like the chap sitting on the box filled with gold in the beginning of Eckhart's book. Always looking, hungering, for fulfillment from outside. And of course it's never happened. <br />At a stage of my life almost two years ago I was desperately seeking some answers - and I should add struggling with alcohol. My youngest son, Erich, told me one day that he had bought a new book that he thought I should read. To me this was a sure sign: if one of your children, who has never suggested a book to you before suggests this, you'd better listen. I ruled out coincidence from his suggestion and found The Power Of NOW in the local library and began a journey into the Present. <br />The Power Of NOW has become a daily constant companion. And during this lovely Spring weather here in Texas I find myself lately sitting among the Wild Flowers, birds. squirrels, trees, plants, wind and sky for hours hanging out with Eckhart in his The Realization Of Being CD album. <br />And like some of the other reviewers I do not wish to sugar coat this work like so much New Age bs. It's hard work and like so much inner work it is liable to meet with much resistance from our conditioned thought processes. It certainly has mine. As is taught in the East (and now West) that if you seriously attempt inner work you may release some old sewerage and you'd better be well prepared to experience it floating to the surface - vile bile. <br />What I am attempting to say is that with Eckhart's and Leonard Jacobson's (Embracing the Present) help, I am now realizing a dawning of a new consciousness - just enough of a gap between the thoughts to begin to see a new light. I have for too long now lived with my pain and suffering and it truly is difficult to let go of what I took for granted as a necessary part of my identity. <br />And the struggle goes on...<br />Ed Shore in Fort Worth, Texas
0446678430|2.0|Like other reviewers I have bought four of Robert's titles (about NZ$130). I would only recommend the first and third, Rich Dad Poor Dad and Guide to Investing. Retire Young is senile. It is a now old story that was thrillingly novel on the first telling but only ellicits a polite smile on the nth recount. Accordingly, I felt like a sucker after purchasing this book. <BR>As for ideas like Leveraging your Context, I appreciate the sentiment but, linguistically, Robert is falling towards the corporate HR psychobabble that his auidence wishes to escape. He is speaking like a Dilbert joke. Or worse, a cynical Dogbert selfhelp book. <BR>At 300+ pages I crave substance. Robert recounts stories of buying a house for $50,000 and two years later selling for $100,000. OK, I don't expect what worked for him to work for others, however, these tantilising examples would be more instructive if he recounted what he learnt, what skills he found important, tales of serendipity and acumen We are told that he once visited six bankers to obtain $35,000 and are told that he learnt something on each failed meeting but not told what exactly. It is akin to Arnie saying that to get big and strong, you must go to the gym and then failing to give any exercise prescriptions. <BR>In conclusion, congratulations on your success Robert, well done. I will, however, be scrutinising any future products from your \\"brand\\" very closely.
0684800713|2.0|I thought the book The Sun Also Rises was a book for &quot;book worms.&quot; The book was ok, I guess. It was some what interesting. I thought that the book was kind of boring also. I'm not a big reader so I guess that makes a big part of it. It's considered a classic and a great book because of who it was written by and the fact that the book was written in the 30's.
B00003CXTF|1.0|You can forget this one.  I don't think there's been such a huge waste of production money since WATERWORLD and HEAVEN'S GATE.  How anyone could take an event as monumental as Pearl Harbor and turn it into a slow, simpering, dreary soap opera is a mystery to me.  The thing is sanitized and politically correct beyond belief--it's 1941 and nobody smokes!  Cuba Gooding does his by-now-standard walkon as the heroic black guy held down by the white system, the women come across like California career valley girls in 1940s nurses' uniforms, and Josh Harnett does so much sad-eyed puppy dog whining that you're actually relieved when he gets killed off in the end (don't worry--knowing that won't ruin this turkey for you, I promise).  But the biggest irritant is Ben Affleck.  If there's a more annoying, artificial leading man around today, I don't know who it is.  He manages to project a self-absorbed inner weakness and lack of character even as he's jutting his sculptured jaw and doing his John Wayne imitation.  And in this stupid flick, he's HERE, he's THERE, he's EVERYWHERE!  He's a fighter pilot who goes off to join the Eagle Squadron and fly Spitfires in the Battle of Britain.  He gets shot down.  Then he ends up in Pearl Harbor flying P-40s for the Army Air Corps.  Then he mysteriously ends up transferred to B-25 bombers for emergency duty with Jimmy Doolittle for his famous Tokyo raid.  What--there weren't enough qualified bomber pilots already trained to fly this important mission, they had to re-train fighter pilots Affleck and whimper-boy Hartnett to get the job done?  Ridiculous.  Slow, ponderous, boring, poorly written, and burdened with special effects (when something finally, actually does happen) that seem far too sci-fi for a WWII tale, PEARL HARBOR is a complete and utter failure.  You want to see the definitive story of the Japanese attack on Pearl Harbor, rent 1970's TORA TORA TORA.  Now there is a fantastic movie about Pearl Harbor.
B000063DFN|5.0|While this is probably not Maiden's best work it is my favorite because it was the first album of theirs that I got into.  It is one of their most epic releases ever with powerful metal opuses like 'Rime of the ancient mariner' and 'Powerslave' which was the song that made me a Maiden fan to begin with.  I don't think I cared too much for them before I heard the heavy power riffs that kick this song off.  That convinced me that this band was for real and not just another big hair pop metal band like some of their songs might suggest.  (I love 'Run to the hills but it's not exactly the heaviest song they ever wrote by any means)<BR>This album also has my favorite Iron Maiden song of all time.  That being 'Aces high' which is a faster, more aggressive version of 'The trooper'.  The only complaint I have is that in the new remastered version the intro to Powerslave is hacked off! What's up with that?  Sure, it is somewhat unnecessary but so is the old prophet dude intro to 'The number of the beast' and they wouldn't cut that one out if their lives depended on it. When I listen to the song powerslave I want to hear evil mummy laughter!  It's a good thing that I have a version that has it, uncut and pure.  So, in short, if you like epic metal buy this cd, edited and all.
6304493681|5.0|Let's make this short and sweet.  I've been watching anime films for YEARS!  If you are just getting into anime, this IS the film to get, PERIOD.  Believe me, you won't be wasting your money.  Its just one of those movies you tend to watch over and over again.  All around excellence!  Some other anime films that I could suggest for the intro. anime individual are Princess Mononoke, Akira and Blue Submarine #6.
B000063DS1|5.0|The original album was great and still is, but this box set blows me away. Between the extra tracks with Bob Dylan, Neil Young and Joni Mitchel this album is worth buying. But to add some rehersals of Van Morrison going over \\"Irish Lulaby\\" and \\"Caravan\\" and Dr. John doing \\"Such a night\\" this new box set ROCKS!!!!How the band could put Country, blues,Jazz and soul in to one song just floors me.The sound is great, the performances are great and the booklet has some great liner notes and photos. This was one concert I wish I was able to go to. But since I was only seven at the time (1976) I don't think my parents would have allowed it. Thank god my brother is 10 years older then me and had good taste to like THE BAND. Thier are to many hightlights to mention so do yourself a favor, lay out the cash and go back to a time when music had passion and the performer gave his or her all. A few band that still have that passion now a days, MARAH \\"KIDS IN PHILLY\\", WILCO, Steve Earle,The Gourds,Son Volt and Ryan Adams. \\"Goodnight and goodbye\\"
6304712499|3.0|When I was little and this movie was just released on video I though it was awsome, because of all the flashy, fantastic special effects, but when I got older I got wiser. The reason this movie gets 3 stars is because of the great special effects job. This is recommended to people who don't mind dumb screenplays, direction, ect. and watch action pictures just for the thrill of it all. <BR>The acting is ok, but the film is miss casted in my opinion. I don't think I will ever watch HBO's Animated Spawn series.
0441172717|1.0|There are some good things in Dune. But the bad swamps the good. Clumsy writing, heavy-handed symbolism, self-righteousness, unbelievable dialogue, characters even a comic book would blush at. A book that insults the intelligence at every level.
B00003CXSP|1.0|I have no stomach for slasher movies and this accounts for my<BR>revulsion with this piece of filth.  With my bias clearly stated, I find<BR>the revolting, but closely examined disfigurement of Lecter's<BR>unbelievably wealthy victim, and the dinner party sequence where a<BR>thoroughly drugged, but involuntary guest unknowingly savors the<BR>harvesting, sauting and consumption of his own brain to be way over the top.  <BR>The final scene has Lector flying to freedom while sharing<BR>the previously harvested smoked human brains in his personally prepared<BR>box lunch with a fellow passenger who happens to be a very young boy. <BR>I'm sure the ever scheming Lecter is weighing the relative merits of <BR>butchering the boy against the joys of training an apprentice.  <BR>This movie left me feeling both tainted and diminished like I had <BR>witnessed a very bloody accident.  So why didn't I just turn it off and <BR>walk away?  While tempted many times to do this, I realized I was <BR>seeing the type of film which will be shown fifty years hence <BR>to demonstrate the extreme decadence of the final days<BR>of the West.  Any society which celebrates such trash and <BR>explains it away as a parody or black comedy has lost its way.
B00005YXZH|5.0|Out of the 1765 cds,tapes,8 tracks,and lps I have bought over my 39 years of age,there have only been a handful of artists that took the risk to create an album that I would label as &quot;experimentally phemomenal&quot;: &quot;Sgt. Pepper&quot;, &quot;Sweethearts of the Rodeo&quot;(Byrds),&quot;Dark Side of The Moon&quot;,and a couple more. Jeff Tweedy has successfully placed YHF in this repected genre. The former reviews above have eloquently depicted this masterpiece... so I will not add baggage... UNDOUBTEDLY Jeff Tweedy is the most underrated singer songwriter today, if ever, and he has presently taken the throne as the king of music.

B000003CMB|4.0|This is the original verson, un cut, not tampered with, not cut and pasted in places where the Concert series disc does.  But one thing the previous reviews didn't really talk about was the fact that Duane Allman himself stated in many interviews and radio spots that he played the slide and Dicky Betts played the rest.  Dicky Betts PLAYED THE REST, it's all awesome, but Duane stuck to the slide and Dickey played the standard tuning.  Listen closely, Dicky is wailing away and kicking some serious guitar jams the entire show.  But, the WHOLE group was &quot;on&quot;, they really were, Barry Oakley is in top form, even Greg is kicking, the rythmn section of Jai and Butch have the gas on high and are cooking!  Really exciting stuff.  By the way you will have to get Eat a Peach for Mountain jam and a few more from that evening, but it's worth it.
B00005YXZH|5.0|I've had the mp3's of this album since September, so I can attest that this music has real staying power. It's all really good, and hangs together as a whole. The weakest tune is the single &quot;Heavy Metal Drummer&quot; -- go figure.<br />And the CD sounds great! Much better than the mp3's. You need this record: a milestone in pop music!
B000059MEK|5.0|This CD is just so fun to listen to! After about 2 tracks I was hooked, the funky electronic sampling is very cool. This really raises my spirits when I listen to it.  <BR>  Note: Even though it might sound like it your player is not skipping when you listen to this ;p
B000000H6D|5.0|Soothing, emotional, energetic, hypnotic &amp; powerful describes the music of both Christian Woman &amp; Black No.1 tracks.<BR>The whole album is good but those two songs are BRILLANTY composed.
B00005NWM3|4.0|Nickleback is a coherent bunch of Canucks making fine rock music. As of 2004, I rate this 2nd release as their best. Like other bands, Nickleback sings of angst, despair, loss, and loneliness. Their sophmore effort is better written and better produced with a much slicker feel to it then their debut (\\"The State\\"). Ryan Peake's guitars are crunchy - even on the sweet FM friendly \\"How You Remind Me\\". Kroeger's bass is thump-along above average. Nik Vikedal is a fabulous drummer - dare I say he might be the backbone of this Canadian band. Chad Kroeger is the front man - playing guitar, singing, and taking center stage in just about every picture with his bandmates clearly behind him. Self absorbed (can't tell at this young point in the band's career). Musically, not a bad track can be found. Even the middle tracks all the way to track 10 are standouts (check out \\"Hollywood\\" and \\"Money Bought\\")... this cd rocks. Who hasn't heard \\"How You Remind Me\\" and \\"Too Bad\\"? The sound is fresh and Chad might sing like someone else, but Nickleback in my opinion has a unique sound - separating them from the pack. I have two problems with this CD. One, it's too short (just over 39 minutes). Two, the lyrics to track 1, \\"Never Again\\". Sure, it's supposed to be a song 'against' domestic abuse... but I can see how a vast majority might take it just the opposite way (\\"He's drunk again, it's time to fight... the living room becomes a boxing ring...just tell the nurse you slipped and fell...\\"). More times than not, when a band sings about 'something' - it is glorified. Spousal abuse is a very serious topic and should never be considered acceptable or tolerated. There are so many things to sing about (what happened to the good 'ol days of sex, drugs, and rock & roll?)... these explicit lyrics about spousal abuse are totally unnecessary. If Nickleback felt that they absolutely had to have this song on their CD, bury it towards the back and maybe some of us would miss it... but don't lead off with it and make it track 1.ith it and make it track 1.

B00005OAIE|5.0|First off, John Mayer is one of the greatest guitar players ever! His lyrics are wonderful and are easy to relate to. John is an all-round great musician. He sounds awesome on the cd but even better live. Check out the cd and then check out one of his concerts. You won't regret it. John seems like an all-round nie guy with great looks to back up his vocals and awesome guitar skills. This cd is definitely a must for anyone who appreicates good music.
B00005RYLE|4.0|Evil Dead has been one of my favorite movies for years. This edition is very cool, with great sound and the best picture quality I have seen for this film. The only problem with this edition is the slipcover that the DVD is stored in at the back of the book. The slipcover creates hairline scratches in the DVD. This may not bother some people, but I prefer to keep my DVDs in pristine condition. This is still the edition to have though. What I did was take an old jewel case, removed the outside cover and cut off the edges around where the disc goes so that it was thin enough to store inside the book. This way you can avoid the scratchs.
B00005JKNC|4.0|First of all i have to say i really liked this film. it was a very enjoyable movie with decent acting. i gave it 4 stars because i can understand people saying that it was slightly cheesy and tried too hard to evoke emotions from the audience. i thought jim carrey's performance was really amazing, considering he first became known in a film where he talked out of his butt! he had proved himself to be a decent actor in man on the moon and the truman show but this film requires even more emotional depth than those. in short the film is a good, sweet movie that one should watch if they love frank capra as i do.
B00000JMQE|5.0|An engaging movie, if a bit disquieting, it's not the best chaser to the 1939 MGM/Garland production \\"The Wizard of Oz\\". However, it does give a nod to the latter while staying closer to Baum's source material.    \\"Return\\" has a definite dark, bittersweet character that keeps one coming back for repeat viewings, with lush sets and not too much Disney silliness; the main Wheeler is way overdone, though.    Fairuza Balk is well-cast as Dorothy, and refreshingly the other Oz characters lack the vaudeville heritage and limitations of the MGM cast. The naturalistic acting and settings of mid-1980's sensibilities dominate. Plain optical printing, Will Vinton's claymation, some clever animatronics and puppetry lend visual reality to action that has yet to be matched by subsequent years of CGI trickery.    The only downside of this DVD edition is that the widescreen option is really a letterboxed fullscreen. One can choose to view the pan & scan 4:3 version but then it's cropped. I understand that there is now a later release which works satisfactorily with widescreen displays; make sure of which version you buy.    Definitely recommended!
B000002UAC|4.0|This album follows the same basic formula as PLEASE PLEASE ME; 8 Beatle originals (including the first George Harrison original to make it onto vinyl) and 6 cover versions of songs from their current stage act. The over-all assessment has to be that the originals are generally of a higher quality than on the previous album. &quot;It Won't Be Long&quot;, &quot;All My Loving&quot;, and &quot;Don't Bother Me&quot; are all classics and the rest are great as well. Still, the cover versions aren't quite as energetically performed as on PLEASE PLEASE ME (maybe they did too many takes). If EMI had decided to include the two singles that had been released in the second half of 1963 -- &quot;She Loves You&quot; and &quot;I Want to Hold Your Hand&quot; -- this album would easily garner 5 stars. Sadly, at least in the UK market, singles were singles and albums were albums.....and, yes, I'm still a little angry that they didin't end up on the CD re-issue as bonus tracks<br />That being said, this is still a great album....not as great as the next would be, but still great.
B000000H5K|4.0|Sepultura's Roots went bravely where no other metal album had gone before. It mixed Afro-Brazilian drums and tribal rhytms/music with downtuned nu-metal guitar and death metal vocals. An astonishing achievement. However, there are some things I have to say about Roots as a whole...<br />It's not the masterpiece people say it is. It was released at a great time, rivaling and overtaking most other musical accomplishments of 1996(metal, anyway). Slayer had just released their very own Spaghetti Incident?, Pantera made one big mess of album in Trendkill, and KoRn's abysmal follow-up Life Is Peachy was out too. Amidst this, Sepultura released Roots. If you compare it to Metallica's Load, well...we'll just leave it at that. Nonetheless, it lacks the flare of previous releases. Beneath The Remains was a classic, Arise was a masterpiece, and Chaos A.D. was experimental and brilliant. Roots isn't. Better than other metal releases of the time, but not an opus everyone makes it out to be.<br />Chaos A.D. mixed the tribal elements with the music fairly well, but managed to thrash and burn like hell, with riffs occasionally slowing down enough to hurtle skullward. Many don't consider that album very highly, but it took the tribal stuff pretty far without commercializing it. On Roots, it's almost a gimmick. All the band members cut their hair and put on makeup. Solos are removed from songs, messy, or nonexistent-only to be replaced with percussion interludes and brazilian tribes singing. The speed isn't too slow, but it makes Chaos A.D. sound incredibly fast, and Arise sound lightspeed. The change from Chaos to Roots was completely uncalled for, regardless of the tribal stuff on Chaos. The tight playing is sacrificed for a sprawling 72-minute noisefest. Another thing-there's a lot of profanity in here! Not one or two words, mind you. The album's drenched in it, and there's no PA sticker!<br />Some songs are still good, and the album does the whole nu-metal thing much better thananyone of KoRn's 'influential' pieces of garbage. Highlights: \\"Roots Bloody Roots,\\" \\"Attitude,\\" \\"Ratamahatta,\\" \\"Spit,\\" \\"Born Stubborn,\\" \\"Jasco,\\" \\"Itsari,\\" \\"Dictators**t,\\" and the Canyon Jam.<br />I recommend this to Sepultura fans and nu-metal fans. It's not thrash metal, so don't expect vintage Sepultura here. Try to enjoy the experience. Roots truly kick started nu-metal, and opened the world to tribal metal. If you don't like it, check out Chaos A.D. for a thrashier approach, and Arise, Beneath, and Schizo for intense, brutal, aural insanity. Peace.
B00005O3VC|5.0|This movie is HILARIOUS!!!  The pythons have taken one of the world's greatest fairy tails and given it a whole new spin.  It tells the story of King Arthur and the Knights of the Round Table in a search for the Holy Grail.  But nothing is normal in the world of the pythons.  The Knights meet a three-headed guard who argues with himself, and complains of his own bad breath, they meet some French knights who taunt them mercilessly, and best of all, a vicious bunny-rabbit that must be killed with the Holy-Hand-Grenade!  This movie is just so fun to watch, I guarantee that you will laugh during every minute!
B00005QDW1|2.0|But if you enjoyed the No Doubt of the 90s..that ska/punk group with the wicked vocals... Go buy some other ska albums!  Do not support this...crud.  I'm sorry but I have lost a LOT respect for No Doubt.  They've turned into a band out just for the money (which is in the younger teenage crowd) rather than the music.  Shame on you No Doubt. Shame on you!
B00003CX5P|4.0|As to the film, I think it speaks for itself.  Lucas has always been a groundbreaker in special effects.  \\"Star Wars IV: A New Hope\\" set the tone for a decade, and \\"Episode I\\" will do a similar thing.  Just look at all the mirror movies, such as A.I., or even \\"O Brother, Where Art Thou?\\" which was entirely computerized.<br />We know the story, and we know the flaws in the story.  I admit there is too much Jar-jar, but he is not the only character, or the only flaw in the film.  Overall, it is a good film that harkens back to the majestic epics of the 1950's that dazzled one young boy from modest Modesto California.  By the way, I have a lot of family in Stanislaus County, so I quite familiar with this town.  \\"American Graffiti\\" is quite accurate-all they could do there have car or pod races.<br />In my humble opinion two films, aside from Episodes IV-VI, are \\"Ben-Hur\\" and \\"American Graffiti.\\"  \\"Ben-Hur\\" is the epics of epics that have influenced so many parodies on The Simpsons.  But it captures the majesty and magic that Hollywood once was.  Lucas, along with Spielberg, has brought back the glory days of the Golden Age of Hollywood.  \\"The Phantom Menace\\" is an attempt to bring the epic sweep to the sci-fi genre.  Asimov in \\"Foundation,\\" and Herbert in \\"Dune\\" captured the essence of epic in print, but Lucas was the first to bring this majesty (I apologize for repeating this word, but it is the only one that fits) to science fiction films.  Before him, we just had \\"2001,\\" although \\"Planet of the Apes\\" tried.<br />The second film was the aforementioned \\"American Graffiti,\\" which was Lucas's second film, and which paid for \\"Star Wars.\\"  In my opinion, it is one of the funniest movies ever made.  There is not a lot of humor in Star Wars, but Lucas's working with Spielberg on the Indian Jones movies brought his forgotten talent to the surface.  That is why Jar-jar seems so out of place: the Star Wars films have been 98% serious, and when we have a comic relief Caliban (see \\"The Tempest\\" by Shakespeare), we don't know what to do.  \\"The Phantom Edit\\" took care of this problem.<br />I saw two problems with the film, both script problems.  The first is that Qui-Gon Jinn was not a consistent character.  During the first part of the movie, he is concerned about being patient, and then on a dime, he gets concerned about time and getting off of Tatooine.  The second problem is that Darth Maul didn't get the screen time he deserved.  We have a thoroughly hideous character, and intense fighter to boot, but we only see him in action twice.  If Lucas had him pick off Jedi Knights or members of the council along the lines of a mass murderer, he would have been far more sinister. Something along the lines of \\"The Pelican Brief\\" or \\"Hannibal,\\" but with the elegance of swordplay would have been better.<br />The DVD is perfection.  These discs show what DVD's were meant to be!  Disc Two is great.  It has seven deleted scenes that can be seen alone, in a group, or with a surrounding commentary to explain why they were removed.  There is an hour-long documentary on making the film, the commercials and theater trailers, plus the music video to \\"Dual of the Fates.\\"  There are several featurettes and clips that explain the different aspects of the making of the film.  Apparently Lucas had a camera filming him as he was working from Day One on November 1, 1994 when he began writing the script.  You even see the binder in which he wrote \\"American Graffiti,\\" and the \\"Star Wars\\" movies.  There disc also works on your computer's DVD player where you can accesses more goodies on starwars.com.<br />The easter-eggs include a blooper reel: got to the THX logo on disc one, and type in \\"1138,\\" and the other one is on the delete scenes menu.<br />The film is not one of Lucas's best, but it is not as bad as people made it out to be.  Hopefully the rough edges will be filed down in Episode II.ee \\"The Tempest\\" by Shakespeare), we don't know what to do.  \\"The Phantom Edit\\" took care of this problem.<br />I saw two problems with the film, both script problems.

B000063DS1|5.0|All tracks have been remixed to wonderful effect.  The sound is gorgeous; balanced, but each instrument and voice clear and in place.  I can hear the harmony vocals clearly, which I could not on vinyl or the previous cd.  Fine performances are enhanced; &quot;The Night They Drove Old Dixie Down&quot; and &quot;It Makes No Difference&quot; appear here in definitive versions.  The improved sound alone makes this an essential addition to my collection.<br />But it's the new tracks that clinch the deal.  &quot;The Weight&quot; and &quot;Rag Mama Rag&quot; performed on the night are fine; &quot;Caldonia&quot; is a<br />bar-room rave-up by experts at the top of their game.  The real standouts for me are an absolutely gorgeous, compelling &quot;King Harvest&quot; from the rehersal night.  Richard Manuel has never turned in a better vocal on this song.  It's followed by Manuel and Van Morrison doing &quot;Tura Lura Lural&quot; with more soul styling than the performance night, and Van does an incredible workout<br />on Caravan.  Those rehersals must have been something.<br />  I'm not sure why the last few tracks - &quot;Mad Waltz&quot; and following, are there.  They are work tapes of ideas that we later<br />hear as finished work.  While I'm always fascinated by bits of the musical creative process I'm not sure I'll listen to them more than once or twice.  But that's a quibble - three tracks of filler out of this whole set is not a bad ratio at all.  The only<br />song I wish had been included that was not is &quot;Georgia On My Mind&quot;.  It may have been left off because of recording problems,<br />but given the wonderful remixing and sound improvements here I'd think these clever and skilled engineers could have given us that  one too.<br />The packaging is great; wonderful pictures, most of them new to me, and satisfying notes.  You will not regret buying this set.
B000002B2T|5.0|I have listened to this album over and over again since Layne passed away, and I can honestly say he is one of the greatest lead singers in all of music. His uncanny knack for making harmonies with Mike McCready's guitar is second to none, and I just wish that they made another album together.<br />Perhaps there are some songs that did not make the album that can be released?<br />At least we know Layne is happy and probably making some incredible music with Andrew Wood from Mother Love Bone and I am sure that Kurt Cobain is stopping by to add some more to the music.

B00004XPP0|3.0|What is really disheartening is how many people are waiting for this excellent space opera to be translated to DVD. What a perfect venue for such a visual feast. But sadly, rather than heed the huge demand of fans for this series to be released on DVD, the emphasis appears to be on re-releasing the VHS format... over and over and over again.<br />I own this trilogy on VHS, and enjoy the enhancements that have been made to this set over the original release. I am anxious to obtain this trilogy on DVD. I already own the VHS, do not want to buy another set on VHS, and want it on DVD. But can I get it?<br />No! Only the refurbished VHS version keeps popping up again and again.<br />I thought there would be hope after Phantom Menace appeared on DVD. But no.... evidently hope misplaced.<br />The folks who steadfastly refuse to release these titles on DVD are doing a massive disservice to their fans, to movie affecinados, and to their own bottom line. It is, as another wanderer of the cosmos might quip, \\"illogical\\".<br />The VHS Trilogy has some wonderful enhancements over previous releases. Yet, the evident lack of regard for a huge and growing segment of the viewing and movie buying fandom is alarming and disconcerting.<br />Until it is available on DVD, then maybe this would be a great series to have on VHS. However, if you long to see this on DVD, I would encourage you to hold out until the producers finally accomodate their fans.
B00005B36H|5.0|Tool has got to be one of the best, most original bands out there now. This album, which was the album that introduced me to Tool, is coruscating and complex, dark and haunting, intelligent and articulate. It is deep, intense metal, with long, intricately woven songs. anyone who is a fan of heavy music and is open minded will enjoy this album, so long as they dont take it at surface value. Tool should go down as one of the most intelligent bands of today.
B00005YXZH|5.0|Wilco's latest release Yankee Hotel Foxtrot, is a  captivating album that manages to capture the best elements of their previous works.   Wilco's last effort, Summerteeth, had a  lush sound and most of the songs were completely filled out.  Yankee Hotel Foxtrot sounds much more open and stark in comparison.   This record, while employing the production wizardry of Summerteeth, manages to capture the intimate feel of AM and Being There.  While Summerteeth used keyboards and effects to create a  inviting retro sound, this album uses those same things to create a leaner more modern sound.    <BR> While the album opener \\"I Am Trying To Break Your Heart\\" starts off with a humming synth part, it eventually transitions to a strummed acoustic guitar before Tweedy's weary  vocals enter the song backed by some abrasive percussion.  \\"Reservations,\\" perhaps the plushest song on the album, uses a  haunting piano part to conjure up the heaviness that compliments the lyrics.  The chorus \\"I've got reservations; bout so many things; not about you,\\" sounds like the singer is trying to convince himself of this and not his partner.  Saying that the songs are sparse doesn't meant they are dark or slow. \\"Kamera\\" and \\"War on War\\" are both catchy songs driven by an acoustic guitars, but they are accented agreeably with keyboards.  The song with the strongest hook on the album is \\"I'm the Man Who Loves You\\" which features a fuzzy guitar line and great back up vocals.  One of the more daring songs is \\"Heavy Metal Drummer.\\"  Wilco combines a hip hop beat and spaceship like effects with lyrics about going to see bands in the summer.   Wilco also manage to create some  intimate songs like \\"Ashes of American Flags\\" and \\"Radio Cure\\" that have a draws the spellbound listener into the songs.   \\"Ashes\\" takes the listener on a dizzying journey that starts simply with \\"The cash machine; is blue and green\\" and ends with an emotional stream of feedback and other noises.   Tweedy's lyrics continue to follow in the same vein of Summerteeth.  The stream of conscious lines like \\"I am an American aquarium drinker\\"  from \\"I am Trying to Break Your Heart\\" add to the starkness of the cd.   Overall Yankee Hotel Foxtrot creates an open sound

B00004RF9I|5.0|Recently purchased by a large conglomerate, mired in fourth place in the ratings, the UBS network is increasingly under the effective control of<br />corporate hatchet man Frank Hackett (Robert Duvall) who has brought in Diana Christensen (Faye Dunaway) to pump up its ratings. As one of the<br />new team's first steps, they've decided to get rid of the long time anchorman of their evening newscast, Howard Beale (Peter Finch), this despite the<br />objections of his friend Max Schumacher (William Holden).  Max is head of the news division, though his power appears to be slipping away.  But<br />then Howard goes on the air and announces that he plans on killing himself on air in one week's time and suddenly he's got a top-rated show.  Diana<br />who cares about nothing (and no one) other than ratings, jumps all over the situation, recognizing that they can exploit Beale's apparent mental<br />breakdown to lure in viewers.<br />This works briefly, but when the curiosity factor dies out the show begins to slide.  Then, after a meeting at which Max is humiliated to find out he no<br />longer has any real control over the news, he lets Howard go on the air in an obvious state of disarray.  Howard launches into the impassioned speech<br />for which the film is most famous (see above), about how the country is going to the dogs and it's time for everyone to stand up and say : \\"I'm as mad<br />as hell, and I'm not going to take this anymore\\".  Now, instead of just being a novelty act, Howard seems to be speaking for the legions of disaffected<br />and frustrated Americans.  He's become the prophet of doom--he even experiences visitations--who Diana has been looking for and she's ready to get<br />the most out of him.<br />Once the chase for ratings gold begins it quickly spirals out of control.  Howard is soon joined on his show by a soothsayer and a studio audience.<br />Rather than do the news, he now comes out on stage and rants for several minutes before collapsing to the stage floor.  Diana hires an Angela<br />Davis-style Marxist revolutionary to help develop a show that opens each week with self-shot footage of a terrorist act carried out by the Symbionese<br />Liberation Army-like \\"stars\\"; it's the advent of terrorist reality tv.  When Max loses the power struggle with Hackett, he's forced out of the network<br />entirely, though he continues an affair with Diana.<br />In one of the very best scenes ever in the movies, Mrs. Schumacher (Beatrice Straight in an Academy Award winning role), refuses to accept his<br />decision to leave her.  She lays out in the starkest terms possible the quality of his betrayal of her and of their marriage :<br />  Get out, go anywhere you want, go to a hotel, go live with her, but don't come back! Because, after 25 years of building a home and raising<br />  a family and all the senseless pain that we have inflicted on each other, I'm damned if I'm gonna stand here and have you tell me you're<br />  in love with somebody else! Because this isn't a convention weekend with your secretary, is it? Or - or some broad that you picked up<br />  after three belts of booze. This is your great winter romance, isn't it? Your last roar of passion before you settle into your emeritus years.<br />  Is that what's left for me? Is that my share? She gets the winter passion, and I get the dotage? What am I supposed to do? Am I supposed<br />  to sit home knitting and purling while you slink back like some penitent drunk? I'm your wife, damn it! And, if you can't work up a<br />  winter passion for me, the least I require is respect and allegiance! (She sobs) I'm hurt! Don't you understand that? I'm hurt badly!<br />Just as the Network is sacrificing integrity and quality in favor of sensationalism and profits, so too is Max shown to be sacrificing personal integrity,<br />his own dignity, and his obligations to his wife in the pursuit of mere sensation.  By the time that even the Marxist guerillas are arguing over who<br />owns syndication rights for their series, it becomes plain that everyone's values are for sale as television consumes and cheapens all human emotions<br />and ideas and then regurgitates a debased pabulum that entertains without making any demand upon the viewer.  When Howard Beale begins to<br />reveal this truth to his viewers, exposing the shallowness and tawdriness of their lives, and the exploitative nature of the medium, panic sets in at the network.  They determine that<br />Howard must be gotten rid of at any cost.  And when Max finally realizes that Diana is the very personification of television--empty; emotionless;<br />profit driven; an observer of, rather than a participant in, reality--their relationship too falls apart.<br />Paddy Chayefsky, who wrote the screenplay, had worked in television in its early days (most famously, writing Marty [1953]), when there was a<br />genuine commitment on the part of networks to balance out the prevalent dreck with some quality programming and with a commitment to news as a<br />public service.  The future he imagined for television may have seemed  pessimistic at the time but has more than come to fruition.  We live in an age<br />when the networks show suicides, car chases, workplace and high school shootings live; put people on desert islands and pit them against each other;<br />sell time to psychics; compete against one another to show ever more explicit sex, violence, and profanity; don't cover political conventions and<br />presidential speeches, but provide blanket coverage of celebrity deaths and arrests; and so on, ad nauseum.

0393317552|5.0|As all scientific inquiries do, this one began with a question. Jared Diamond, a physiology professor at UCLA and an evolutionary biologist working for many years in Papua New Guinea, was asked the question that launched this book by a native friend, Yali. To paraphrase, both the question and the thesis of Guns, Germs, and Steel (GGS), \\"How come Western societies developed the means to conquer and exploit non-Western societies?\\" And why wasn't it the reverse -- why didn't the Americas conquer Europe, for instance?<br />Thus begins what Diamond calls \\"13,000 years of history on all continents [compressed] into a 400-page book.\\" The breadth of what GGS covers is breathtaking, and the conclusions, surprisingly, not at all counterintuitive. In fact, every time Diamond pointed out a conclusion based on his researches, it wasn't so much a door opened on a new room as a door opened on an old room I couldn't quite construct in my mind until I was shown how. I think that's how teachers teach best: not by showing you something entirely new, but by showing you how to fit together the jagged edges of pieces of the old you already know.<br />To risk even further compression, here is what Diamond proposes. The necessary conditions for cultural triumph, in no particular order, are: population density, large animal domestication, food production (agriculture), resistance to diseases passed from animals and plants to humans, technological inventiveness and acceptance of change and improvement, literacy (at least among the elites), and centralized government. Add to that mix of accident and planning the good fortune of an east-west continental orientation -- and the consequent east-west spread of population, domestic animals, disease, technology, writing and government -- and you have the necessary conditions for a dominant society.<br />However, as Diamond takes pains to point out, these are not sufficient conditions for success. A lot depends on chance, some of it on inventivenessin individual societies, some to forward-looking government, and some even to individual vision and initiative. It's as if, as I paraphrase from what he says at the beginning of chapter nine, which is Diamond's own paraphrase of Anna Karenina, \\"successful societies are all alike; every unsuccessful society is unsuccessful in its own way\\": <br /><> If a society's population is not sufficiently dense, or has an unfavorable climate, or poor raw materials, it will never graduate from the hunter-gatherer stage;<BR><> If a society has no crops at hand that are suitable for domestication, they will never develop sufficient population density to overcome weaker societies; <BR><> If a society has no large animals at hand that are suitable for domestication, they will never develop sources of meat, transportation, beasts of burden and so forth;<BR><> If a society fails to develop dense populations of crops, animals and humans, they will never develop the germs, and resistance to those germs, that allow them to kill off (usually unintentionally) less dense, less resistant populations;<BR><> If a society fails to develop a population sufficiently dense to support specialist classes and a strong central government, it will never become organized enough to overcome or absorb its enemies in war.<br />And so on. Diamond appears to agree with Hobbes that war is the natural state of humankind, and his examples demonstrate that depressing assertion. Likewise, he asserts that all centralized governments evolve into a \\"kleptocracy,\\" which justifies feeding the rich off of the labor of the poor, either through fear of its power or through religion (which is another form of fear). In writing this book, Diamond at once provides a convincing explanation for the differing developments of human societies on different continents throughout human history, and explodes myths of innate racial superiority. The recurring theme that I glean from GGS is that the success of a society rests in equal parts on accident and on human intervention -- and not all of that human intervention is entirely conscious.<br />Some of the author's detractors may say that his assertion that the east-west continental orientation of the Old World, versus the north-south orientation of the New World, is a strained explanation of societal success -- a geographical determinism -- but I must point out that Diamond stresses that there are no single causes: there are many causes of failure to develop \\"cargo,\\" as the Guinean Yali put it. And there are many causes for societies who once had cargo -- like the medieval Islamic and the ancient Chinese, not to mention the ancient Mediterranean -- to lose their cargo and their superiority. But, as Diamond so excellently points out in Guns, Germs, and Steel, one of the causes was not race.

As a proud veteran of the U.S. Army, even though I never served in combat, this movie made me feel proud to be an American. Just like the old song. I went to see this movie with my two kids, both young teenagers, and they sure liked this film quite a bit, so much they even wanted to go see it again. I said maybe we'd just go ahead and get the DVD, since the whole family liked it. Anyhow, the last time that happened was Toy Story 2, so you can see that this is in fact very much a quality movie, not just limited to old veterans like yours truly.
0345308239|4.0|Where is Barbara Tuchman now that we need her? As the United States pursues a \\"war\\" on \\"terrorism\\" -- the former undeclared, the latter undefined -- I fear we are heading down a familiar road that led the Trojans to open their doors to the Greek horse, the Renaissance popes to ignore the Protestant secession, the British to lose their colonies and the Americans to lose in Vietnam. All it takes, the two-time Pulitzer-winning author claims, is folly: the pursuit by governments of policies contrary to their own interests, despite the availability of feasible alternatives. Even, perhaps especially, eighteen years after publication, this book is crisp, lively, and relevant.<br />\\"The power to command\\" concludes the author, who earns high marks for being an independent scholar rather than an academic, \\"frequently causes failure to think. \\" Of course there are examples of individual folly, that is, folly committed by individuals. However, folly by governments is more far-reaching. Merely surrounding yourself with competent people, as apologists for George W. Bush boast, will not steer you away from folly: JFK had \\"the best and the brightest\\" working for him, yet he began to get the US deeply involved in Vietnam; fearing the right wing would think him soft on Communism, Johnson escalated the folly. It is principally for that Vietnam section, comprising over a third of the volume, that I recommend this book. <br />....<br />In The March of Folly, Tuchman does not shrink from harsh criticism of politicians. In the semi-mythical Trojan War, at least the gods could be blamed for the successful Greek ruse. The roguish, opportunist, nepotistic politicians of the Holy See, from 1470-1530, saw that they were doing wrong, but lacked either the sense or the courage to put it right and save the church. Those Renaissance popes saw the chair of Peter as a cash box for their personal aggrandizement, and a venue for their political exploits and carnal festivals -- but only because that was the way things had always been done. The British couldn't grasp that their American colonies consisted of people who, once having tasted of freedom, might be irked to have that freedom recalled and, at the same time, might not like their sweat equity in the new land become an entitlement for the lords.<br />The first three sections of The March of Folly are well and vividly written, a melding of historical narrative and commentary. I suspect that Tuchman couldn't wait to wrestle with the Vietnam War. Here her insight into the workings of policy makers from Eisenhower to Nixon is acute, yet dissected in an account that a layman can follow. One of the most interesting, and currently relevant, observations from Tuchman is prompted by a remark made at the time by Governor Nelson Rockefeller: \\"We ought all to support the President. He is the man who has all the information and knowledge of what we are up against.\\" That, she says, \\"is a comforting assumption ... usually invalid, especially in foreign affairs.\\" When pursuing liberty, America will wave its flag and invest its heart. But the current administration would do well to follow the second part of John Quincy Adams's dictum: \\"... but [America] goes not abroad in search of monsters to destroy.\\" Smiting terrorists for their actions is one thing, and one with an end in sight; aiming to smite terrorism, root and branch, worldwide, is not only endless, it is folly's march.

B00005YXZH|5.0|I began listening to this record back in September of 2001. I love it then and I still love it today. There were 4-5 songs that I couldnt stop listening to(Kamera, War on War, HMD and Pot Kettle Black) Eventually the rest of the material seaped into my consciousness and it became clear that this was going to be a classic. Unfortunately when I downloaded the album I only downloaded 10 songs. I went to see Wilco earlier this week in Montreal and Jeff Tweedy stepped up to the mike to sing what obviously was going to be a quiet song. He went into &quot;Reservations&quot;, song 11 from YHF and it was the most beautiful thing I have ever seen/heard. <br />Many of the reviews I have read indicate how arty and daring an album this is...dont let that scare you. This is simply a great pop album. It has so many layers, its bouncy, beautiful and brilliant. If you dont seem to want to dance to 5 or 6 of these songs then you could possibly be in a coma.<br />I bought the real CD the other day and I have never felt better about a purchase, this record has the goods.<br />Cheers
B000002X2B|5.0|Other reviewers have already told the tale of this Paul Kantner science fiction project, of how the name Jefferson Starship was chosen as an umbrella title for this dream, this vision that Paul Kantner has which encompassed the musical friends who helped him out in getting the album off the ground.<br />Despite the fact that I hate the term this really is a concept album in the truest sense of the word reflecting Paul's vision rather than a group of songs very loosely connected with a central theme.<br />For me this album represents the end of the era associated with the Summer of Love and the start of a growing realisation among many in the musical community that political realities had not crumbled but were back in force in a big way evidenced by the shooting of the students in Ohio. The album, one of a number made by the same loose collection of musicians, is at the pinnacle of achievement for those same people, most of whom had found commercial success in playing their music the way that they wanted to rather than the way the record companies wanted them to.<br />Blows against the Empire is a symbol of the lengths that would need to be gone to to put into practice those principles that visionaries like Paul Kantner believed in. In fact the reality is that change can only truly come about through constant struggle. Struggle to maintain your beliefs against adversity, struggle to make your voice heard, struggle to achieve. Those values are still valid today, still worth having and still worth striving for.<br />This is a superb album. If you have not got it you should order one right away and when it arrives, sit back with your headphones on and marvel.
0451169514|4.0|A haunting but equally uplifting novel, 'It' has long been regarded as one of Stephen King's finest and rightfully so, and in terms of complexity and ambition, it is without equal.   <BR>The story centres around the experiences of a group of friends quest to destroy an evil in their home town, spanning over a quarter of a century.<BR>Like most of King's novels, although it is a supernatural story the characters are so well developed and realistic it makes the story instanly believable. <BR>The novel begins in the 1950's and slowly moves on to the group's experiences in the 80's.  It becomes more and more interwoven as the story gains pace until at the final stages the time changes take place within a matter of pages, achieving a very satisfying effect.<BR>Although it is over a seemingly daunting thousand pages, the style is so readable that it's suprising how quickly you finish it.  The story of friendship, hope and of course horror contains as many uplifting moments as it does shocking.<br />Perhaps this is not the best choice for those who are new to King but it is an excellent read nonetheless.
B000001FGG|5.0|As the United States moved towards the cultural revolution of the 1960s the music scene was developing on a separate path which ultimately converged with the Bay Area scene.<br />British pop music from the Beatles had two major strands, the pop orientated Beatles and the R'n'B represented by the Rolling Stones. It was this branch that brought some of the best US blues based music to a British audiences and led to a growing interest in the blues. The Beatles interest in American r'n'b became a widespread concern and records not available to the general British public were sought out and circulated widely among musicians.<br />All of this set the scene for the growing numbers of bands who turned to the blues particularly electric blues. The roles of John Mayall and Alexis Korner as conduits in this process is inestimable. Mayall in particular nurtured a number of young blues guitarists who later went on to achieve artistic and commercial success one of whom was Eric Clapton.<br />Wheels of Fire in some respects is the ultimate Cream album, epitomising as it does the two faces of the band. On the one hand there is the song orientated side wherein Jack Bruce in particular could utilise his not inconsiderable writing talents and on the other is the performance based side where each of the band shone bur Clapton in particular. It was his playing which earned him the title of 'god' which adorned walls throughout the UK.<br />As well as a showcase for the lyrics of Pete Brown who later went on to record the excellent 'Things may come and things may go but the art school dance goes on forever', the first album of this double set contains the excellent menacing 'Politician', of course the ever popular 'White Room' and could well have been an album in it's own right and was released as two separate albums as well as a double in the UK.<br />Album two is a splendid tour de force which probably caused more young men to take up the air guitar than any other album before or since. The sheer energy and feeling that is contained therein is astounding. In a way it is very reminiscent of the Grateful Dead in that the band consisted of three lead players each of whom vied for overall leadership of the band which itself contributes to the tightness of the overall sound and which leads to the excellent performances contained here. It is astounding to hear again and again the power of these performances. Incredible.<br />After this, it was hard to match the standards of Wheels of Fire and things were never to be the same. This is an essential album to have in your collection if you like the authentic blues or guitar. Play it to your children when they are old enough to listen and to appreciate. It stands the test of time and deserves to be in any pantheon there happens to be which celebrates electric blues.The sheer energy and feeling that is contained therein is astounding.

6304602979|5.0|No doubt this is one of my favorite movies.  I was surprised at first to discover that its director was the same guy who made &quot;Top Gun&quot; but it makes a certain kind of sense.  The movie is kind of comic-booky, perhaps a reflection of the innocence and distorted reality of the two main characters-Clarence thinks that Elvis talks to him.  Everything is larger-than-life, and Clarence and Alabama are super cool and beautiful, even-when they're in the midst of a bloodbath.<BR>What really makes this a fantastic movie though, is the way it combines so much cool stuff into a movie without the plot becoming overly complex.  The script is great, the music by Hans Zimmer is great, and all of the little supporting performances-like Brad Pitt, Samuel L. Jackson, and Bronson Pinchot-are great.<BR>At times the love story seems a little corny, but Patricia Arquette and Christian Slater do such a good job of selling it that I can believe that they fell completely in love in one night.  In their idealized, cartoony way, they have.
B0000033IS|5.0|This album is utterly a gorgeous piece of music from start to finish.  Never mind that I've never been a huge Aretha fan, everything she's ever done pales in comparison to this one and most all other music pales in comparison, for that matter.  The title track is so awe-inspiring, I can't describe.  All other tracks are chills-inducing as well.  Who could ever deny the eternal &quot;coolness&quot; of this record?
0446678430|1.0|Too much &quot;context&quot; not enough &quot;content&quot;.  The main point that Kiyosaki left me with was, &quot;Hey, if I want to get rich, maybe I should write a book about how to get rich?&quot;  I will say that the motivational aspects of this book may help those with a seemingly incurable self esteem.

0380973650|5.0|I found _American Gods_ to be one of the best fantasy books I've read this year and I must admit that I was a little surprised to see so many negative reviews here. The book does meander, but I found the little plot cul-de-sacs really worth the effort they took to read-- it's a book about a kind of giant road trip, after all.<br />Shadow is to be released from prison after a term with model behaviour, and he has every intention of going back to his loving wife Laura. But when she's killed days before he's supposed to get out-- his trip back becomes very different than the one he'd been waiting for. Instead of finding the America he left when he went into prison, he instead finds an America where the Gods walk the earth, people pull coins from the air, and the dead fail to stay that way.<br />I love (and have always loved) mythology, so perhaps a part of why I loved every bit of the book as much as I did were all the references to the different Gods and Goddesses and their major characteristics. I had the feeling that Gaiman really loves his subject matter, and since I share that love, I was never bored.

It's as if there was no more songs on the whole CD, so bad and unmemorable they are! Just a mess! You can not believe it's the same band that recorded the first two tracks!! What a novelty act this band is!!!
B000024D4R|5.0|What with the punk explosion, the late 70s must have been a tough time for prog-rockers - and none would have felt it worse than the kings of unfathomable psychedelic rock themselves, Pink Floyd.<br />Well, think about it: as far as Joe Public is concerned, it's a flip of the coin whether you or the Callaghan Labour government are responsible for the Sex Pistols. Either way it doesn't look good for your prospect of selling any records.<br />So is the goose finally cooked, then?<br />Not quite.<br />Step forward Roger Waters, a thoughtful and articulate - if irretrievably hung-up - man, and a man who must have been growing increasingly frustrated at being typecast as the progenitor of long albums peppered with infrequent, impenetrable lyrics (been \\"caught in the crossfire between childhood and stardom\\" recently, anyone?), lavish but inexpert keyboard knoodling and gifted but indulgent lead guitar work. (Readers may like to know I take a dim view of Wish You Were Here.)<br />So Mister Waters calls a band meeting. He says, \\"alright chaps, now listen up: this time we're going to do it my way. David: crank your guitar up. Play urgent, driving, dissonant chords. Make your solos somehow less comfy - put some edge in there, make it discordant, really wind it up. Rick: less knoodling from you, please: just play a few chords and keep your mouth shut. Nick: go drive one of your racing cars. I'll call you when I need you. If I need you. Everyone: Here are the lyrics I've written. They're about pigs, dogs, sheep and Mary Whitehouse. It's a political allegory. There are forty five pages of them.\\"<br />Well, you can just imagine the curt stage whisper from D. Gilmour, can't you. Gilmour is known for his dry wit. But at this point, what remained of Waters' sense of humour had all but evaporated - he was shortly to get to the point of gobbing at fans in concert - so perhaps Gilmour saw the valour of discretion and kept his trap shut. And, like a general directing an army, Waters brooked no further argument. Animals was born. Ironic, really.<br />Happily, the result is just what the doctor ordered as an antidote to \\"the malaise\\": an intense, urgent, driving album. In parts, it's (deliberately) ugly. But mostly, it's angry: Waters' invective is at his most stinging, and this time the targets (political and moralist figures amongst them) are thoroughly deserving of his ire.<br />And suddenly, the Sex Pistols and the Floyd are on the same side of the fence again. You wouldn't read about it.<br />Nevertheless, the record starts and ends on an unexpectedly reflective note - opener Pigs and its closing reprise are far more tender than you'd credit, and for that very reason I think the album itself works better than its more reknowned successors. Where both the Wall and the Final Cut transpire to be permanent downers, Animals has the scent of redemption about it.<br />Not something you'd say about much of Roger waters' recorded output since, methinks.brooked no further argument.

B00005YXZH|5.0|I can only ruin this record by writing some hokey review. However...I heard a single from it on NPR and it was like some switch flipped and I believed in good music all over again. The album comes together so beautifully, and is so well concieved, that you'll sit there in numbed appreciation when it finishes (and will listen to it over again to make sure it was as good as you think it was - it is).<br />This will sit next to E.L.Harris' &quot;Wrecking Ball&quot; on my daily play CD shelf. Jeff, if you read these things - thanks.
0140288503|4.0|I enjoyed reading Mark Bowden's Black Hawk Down immensely.  It is a very well researched, fast paced account of the United States military's doomed battle in Somalia.  Bowden is a great story- teller and a meticulous researcher and I enjoy his books very much.  However, I feel that in his recreation he left two very important points out of the story.<br />I might be nit-picking, but I think that these two details are pretty important to the story.  I do not claim to be a military or world affairs expert, but I read Black Hawk Down, watched the movie, and watched the documentary about the battle on the History Channel.  In the documentary on the History channel, they raised these two points I am talking about.<br />First of all, Bowden makes it seem like the raid on Aidide's compound came about because of one specific event, the capture of Aidide's money man by the United States.  The truth of the matter is that the tensions between the US and Aidide built for several months before they exploded into this battle in Mogadishu.  Originally, there was a terrible famine in Somalia and the UN was sent in to bring food and supplies to help the citizens of Somalia.  Somalia's most notorious war-lord, Mohammed Farah Aidide, and his men began to intercept UN food shipments at gun point and take them for themselves, leaving the people of Somalia to die of starvation.  This is where the US involvement came into play.  The US committed troops to track down Aidide and after a series of raids they managed to capture a few of his top men, but not him.  Over the course of several weeks tensions mounted while the raids were taking place.  Aidide had the Somalis whipped into a frenzy with his diatribes against the United States.  After the UN leveled a building in which several of Aidide's top generals were meeting killing them and several innocent civilians without any questions asked, the Somalis wanted American blood.  I do not think that Bowden did as good a job as he could have in explaining the background events that led up to the battle in \\"Mog.\\"  After seeing the documentary on the history channel I had a better idea of what actually happened.<br />Secondly, Bowden fails to mention one very interesting tidbit of information.  Aidide's own son was part of the peacekeeping force sent to Somalia by the United States.  He task, as assigned by the government, was to hunt and kill his own father.  After Aidide's assassination, a few years after the \\"Black Hawk Down\\" incident, his son returned to Somalia to take his father's place in leading his band of Somali thugs.  Personally, I thought this would have made for a very interesting subplot.<br />On the whole, Black Hawk Down is a fantastic book that I would recommend to anyone that likes a fast-paced real life drama.
0440219078|5.0|While reading some of the reviews that gave the book less than five stars, I was simply shocked.  I loved this book.  I believe I have 3 copies at home, and I've read it at least 8 times.  Some of the reasons people gave for not liking the book were that the novel was confusing, they didn't like the ending, it didn't explain things enough, or (and this is the worst) it was \\"disturbing\\". I'm sorry, people, but that is the whole point of the book. <br />I'll first address the fact that this book is confusing.  I think it is a valid point, the book does confuse the reader.  The reader goes into the novel with assumptions, and the author takes those assumptions and smashes them down the garbage disposal.  The frist thing you must realize is that this world is entirely fictional, but like \\"Fahrenheit 451\\" and \\"Brave New World\\", it is set in the future of humanity.  Any confusing events are there to make the reader think. If you are wanting a simple read, just to take your mind off life, I do not reccommend this book.  You are just one of those people that this book is against. The book is thought-provoking.  Lessons are revealed on many levels, and after many reads.  If you find the book confusing, stick with it, read it again, and again, and I guarantee it makes sense.  <br />The ending of the novel is just another method the author uses of involving the reader, making the reader think.  I won't describe it (you'd all hate me forever), but the ending is basically a fill in the blank.  It kills me every time I read it, but every time, I fill in the blank with hope.  You'll understand when you get there.  Basically, it is ambiguous for a reason.  The question the author is asking you is, how will you make the story end?  Will you give up your humanity for peace and contentment and boredom, or will you fight for your right to feel, and see, and think?<br />As for the people who thought the author didn't explain things enough, just deal with it.  The author wrote the book the way the author wanted to write the book, and maybe the explanations have a reason for being ambiguous.  The novel isn't a detailed science report, it is a book with a message, and the author is entitled to whatever poetic license the author wants.  Think about the ambiguity and maybe there is a purpose behind it.  Facts that don't illuminate the message would just detract and confuse people. <br />And now for the other point.  Granted, I only read one that said that the book was disturbing, but that made me so angry that I had to put down my thoughts right away.  The book is SUPPOSED to be disturbing.  If you didn't think it was, then you are disturbed.  But the point is to look at the disturbing parts.  It disturbs you to make you look at your life.  Are you the kind of person who would go along with this society that murders babies, murders those who don't conform? The message is about the price of individuality.  Don't just take a shallow view of this book.  If you want shallow, read \\"The Boxcar Children.\\" This book is for kids, a lesson against peer pressure, but also for anyone who is willing to take the author's challenge and actually THINK for once.
B00005YXZH|5.0|When I first bought this album I was pretty skeptical on how good it was because of all the controversey with Reprise. Boy was I wrong, this album is the album I've been waiting for from Wilco since AM! It has everything, great pop, dark ballads and a little Beatles mixed in for good measure. This is an essential for any serious music fan who is sick and tired of cookie cutter rock. LONG LIVE WILCO!!!!
0380002930|5.0|There are just too many books, which dwell mainly on our human perspective of life and the world about us. This book presents the rabbits viewpoint as humans encroach on their home-front by developing lands and pushing them away, endangering their existence in the wild. Apart from being a very good story in itself, it presents the rabbits' habitats and serves as a reminder to think about other species co-habiting on this Earth with us. Along similar lines, I would like to highly recommend the new book, &quot;ACCUSED BY FACET-EYES&quot; by scientist-author, C.B. Don. Like &quot;Watership Down&quot;, it is a compelling story, but in the form of an exciting science-fiction fantasy and it too opens the mind to the perspective of another species --- the essential pollinator honeybee society, which accuses humankind of endangering their habitats by our thoughtless, global polluting practices. Like the marvelous classic &quot;Watership Down&quot;, this book is surely also a must-read for all caring nature-lovers, who enjoy a fantastic eco-novel!
B00005V9L1|5.0|When I first saw the trailer for this film I was thinking that it looked terrible. I mean, how many teen flicks does the world need? Also, Patrick Swayze's ugly mug popped up and I almost lost it! There was no way I was going to see this. However, after some time had passed and the film went to video/DVD whatever the hell people use these days, a friend of mine had rented it and was raving about how good it was. He told me that I would like it, then I said, \\"Is that the movie with strange looking bunny rabbit thing\\" and he responded with \\"yeah that's it, but you just have to see the film to beleive it, the trailer does not do it justice.\\" So, I found myself at the video store renting Donnie Darko, somehow I was inexplicably drawn to it... Anyhow, I watched it and I was in awe. What a freakin' great film this is!! I was so into it that the next day I went home and watched it again from start to finish, I picked up a lot of the little nuances the second time around, could not figure out the fat jogger man in red outfit though, still working on that. Very funny, very moving, very thought provoking, interesting themes and ideas are generated in this film. Easily the best indie film of 2001. Oh, and as for ol' Patrick Swayze, don't worry he is not the main focus of this movie, plus he receives a splendid demise in the end. This film demands to be watched twice. So much better than all the other [stuff] out there.
079284209X|5.0|Tired of fancy-schmancy movies with those ridiculously unbelievable car chases where no civilians ever get hurt, or there aren't any fellow motorists or pedestrians in the first place? Well, \\"Ronin\\" is your answer.<BR>There are two magnificent car chases in this movie, both excellently directed and shot from perfect camera angles. The first scene involves a NOS-equipped Audi S8, an oldish Benz turbodiesel, and a cargo van, all three of which are chasing the bad guys in their four black sedans. Barely missing dozens of vehicles AND pedestrians, they scream through France on a gravel road, the streets, and back alleys, through the latter of which they usually only have about one foot between them and the walls. The chase ends with the good guys running the bad guys off and into the patio of a restaurant, running over another couple dozen of people.<BR>The second car chase is even BETTER than the first; it's a Peugeot chasing an older M5 again through France. This chase involves HUNDREDS of cars, many of which get believably destroyed as the two cars creat many, many car crashes. The best part of this chase is when they run through a tunnel in the OPPOSITE DIRECTION! And the road wasn't exactly empty.<BR>Anyways, this is absolutely BELIEVABLE. It is by far the most realistic car chase ever. Ever.<BR>And in between those car chases is a pretty damn good story.
B00005ASHM|5.0|This one is a strong contender for best rock album of all time and should be in everyone's collection. Period. Now, it has been reissued countless times (I think I have owned three different versions at least). Unfortunately the best version ever released looks like is no longer available: a stunning one CD containing all tracks in both stereo and mono for the price of a regular CD. Now these versions are sold separately. Which one to buy? Originally, the album was released and mixed in mono. Only recently was the album remixed in stereo. So, if you are interested in the history behind this album, and the whole `painting a moustache on the Mona Lisa' issue, get the mono version. With the stereo version, although you get all the inherent improvements of stereo sound, some sounds from the original album are lost in the stereo mix. Nevertheless, bottom line, for my ears the stereo will always sound best, and that is the version I listen to most. The extra track is just `I know there is an answer' with different lyrics, nothing revealing.
B00000JHAU|4.0|Certainly &quot;dreamy&quot; could describe a great deal of music but its application here isn't a spacey, incoherent wash like My Bloody Valentine.  Instead, it's very conscious and lucid but wacky in the way that dreams can be when you wake up and realize how little sense they made even though it seemed totally plausible at the time.  The music is absolutely gorgeous and more complex than it seems on the first listen.  And if you're one of those people who can appreciate clever lyrical sarcasm (like the Smiths), you'll love their subtle humor.  As much as I like this CD though, I have to slightly disagree with one review who praised their originality; Stuart Murdoch's vocal style bears an uncanny resemblance to Nick Drake.  So for that matter, if you like them, pick up Pink Moon.  Nonetheless, this remains one of my favorites that never gets old.

B00005IC2H|5.0|Simply amazing.  Absolutely blown away.  I've been in a tactonic hypnotic trance at work the past six hours since spinning Agaetic byrjun.  I can't understand a word, yet understand exactly what they're saying.  Never heard violins and nuclear explosions intermingling simultaneously (#6 -- Vidar vel til lottarasa).  Never have I cranked out more material at work on the keyboards -- yet I haven't answered a single phone call for fear of leaving the tunes.<br />Sensational.  The best pick yet that I've seen on [the web]
B00004BZ0N|4.0|This album shows why the clash are the best punk band of all time(certaintly the most talented and varied). It is a riveting epic from start to finish. My personal favorites here are ''The guns of brixton'', ''Spanish bombs'', and ''Wrong 'em boyo''.
B000002J20|5.0|Brilliant!!!  This is not music to play while one's watching Sportscenter or cleaning one's garage.  Every subtle aspect must be absorbed to truly appreciate this melodic, technically perfect odyssey.  This is Yes at their best.  Each movement, while connected, takes the listener to a different mystical landscape or realm.  This is 3-dimensional music---there is depth.  Put on the headphones and listen---more than once--this music is an acquired taste.  Even Yes fans may not \\"get it\\" at first. <br />All the instrumentation is top notch.  Squire's bass while more subtle here than, say, Fragile or Close to the Edge, is a true testament to why he's considered one of, if not the best bass player ever.  White's drumming is fabulous (only time I've heard him better is on Relayer).  Wakeman's keyboards provide the perfect backdrop for this journey.  Anderson' vocals, particularly, the over dubbed harmonies on \\"The Remembering\\" (my favorite) are some of the best.  But the \\"straw that stirs the drink\\" on this album is Steve Howe.  Listen to all the sounds he emotes from not only his guitar but sitar and mandolin as well.  One of the great rock guitar players of all time---very underrated.  The term \\"genius\\" is flung about often too freely.  But it applies to Howe.  He wrote all the music here and his playing ,in terms of versatility, is unmatched in my opinion.<br />If you want music that can be listened to over and over and each time be appreciated for a different aspect, riff or melody, get this CD.  If you want music that will provoke thought and move you, get this CD. <br />If you don't have the time and patience necessary to truly appreciate this masterpiece, get \\"Drama\\".
B000000HTM|5.0|pawn hearts is an album that definitely grows on you.to tell you the truth i didn't really like the album that much when i first  heard it on my girlfriends...little gettoblaster.the production was very strange and the drums had alot of echo and reverb.when i got home i gave it another try and cranked it on my stereo.wow what a difference.peter hammils lead vocals are full of energy,rage and emotion all at the same time.my brother thinks it sounds like he's singing in some deranged musical.the drumming by guy evans is first rate(as is the case in most prog rock bands)and david jacksons sax work is a perfect compliment  to hammils vocals.the organ work and bass pedals are played by hugh banton and convet an almost pastoral sound to many songs. this is a great album for the dedicated progressive rock fan.my  advice would be to crank plague of the lighthouse-keepers on your stereo or preferrably a good set of headphones and listen to it right around 4:20.................enjoy.
B000063DIR|1.0|The latest reissue of Ozzy Obsourne's &quot;Diary of A Madman&quot; is a complete and total disgrace. It's an embarrassment to Ozzy, his fans, and the family and memory of Randy Rhoads. This release blatantly insults two of the musicians who created the original work. <br />A) The original artwork has NOT been restored. <br />B) Advertising a remastered re-issue is one thing. But issuing it and not telling the public that original band members Bob Daisley (bass) and Lee Kerslake (drums) have had their classic parts erased and re-recorded by other musicians is just beyond an outrage. It's beyond comprehension. Kerslake and Daisley not only co-wrote the music, their incredible playing was a huge reason for the enduring success of the music on the LP.   <br />What's next? Someone will re-release Sgt. Pepper with all the parts erased and re-recorded except Paul's? <br />This recording IS NOT the &quot;Diary of A Madman&quot; that fans have grown to love for the past 20 years. Go find an old vinyl copy if you want the real thing. The public is being blatantly exploited with this sham. Real fans (young and old) deserve better than imitations - not to mention the artists on the original work. This disgraceful release should be discontinued immediately.
0345440900|4.0|I bought this book when my newborn was about 3 weeks old out of curiosity not because we were having any problems connecting with our son. I have found it to be very helpful and quite refreshing. At first I thought her EASY method(Eat, Activity, Sleep, You) was silly and not applicable to my baby, but as I studied my baby more using Ms. Hogg's cues, I realized that she was dead on. He basically, eats, does something for a while and then sleeps. Its so simple, but I hadn't thought about this structure before. At about 3 weeks my baby went from being a sleepy and calm newborn to being a regular baby with more awake time. One day, he had a total freakout (something that had not happened before). After reading this book, I realized that my baby was tired and overstimulated. Previously he had no trouble tuning out stimulation and getting himself to sleep wherever he was, but that all changed. Using some of the ideas in this book, my month old has had fewer episodes of crying and can go to bed on his own now with a little assistance, but sometimes just setting the mood works.<br />I also found her info on the sounds of baby's cries and what to observe very helpful. <br />Some of her breastfeeding info may be questionable, but I find many conflicts in a lot of the breastfeeding stuff I read. What's refreshing about Ms. Hogg is that she believes that bottle fed, breastfed, or a combo is all fine. (La Leche League take note. Ms. Hogg might actually turn somebody onto breastfeeding by showing women how they can do both bottle and the [breast] because she doesn't make you feel guilty for the method you choose. Hallelujah!)<br />Her structure is very easy to follow and allows for babies to be individuals while you maintain your sanity. Buy this book, but get a good all-around baby book as well. (Penelope Leach is great and, even though I disagree with Sears on many things, he has good info about babies in his book.) I recommend this book to any new parent even if you think youknow a lot about babies already.
B00005YW4H|4.0|I bought this CD after seeing her performed on the Tonight Show.  There's some sort of connection that you get seeing her live (even on TV) that you don't with the CD- which while being pretty good, just sounded like it's a mere recording.  Still glad to have the CD, because that's a voice worth the very low priced debut CD. [check out her website] if you want to find out where she's playing.  To be sure- buy the CD, but don't missed her when she comes into town (especially now because she'll be performing in a small theatre/club- more intimate surroundings).
B000002LGA|5.0|This sounds like a very yuppy-ish story, but I'll tell it anyways.  I was on the treadmill the other night with endorphines flying around my brain, and Dirty Blvd came on VH1 Classic.  I had not listened to New York in about a year, and the song's lyrics made every hair on my body stand on end.  It was the same way I felt when I first heard this CD back in 1989.<BR>This is one of the most brilliant records ever recorded.  I have read some reviews that considered the lyrics to be bloated and preachy.  I would say that they are simply honest.  Others have cited Lou's limited range as a vocalist.  Try singing these songs;  it is very difficult.  ONLY Lou could pull off a performance like this.  His meter and range are the perfect vehicle for these songs.<BR>The musicianship on this record is every bit as brilliant as the lyrics.  This is an unbelievable guitar record.  Lou and Mike Rathke have unbelievable tone, and their rhythym and leads weave beautifully enough to be the envy of Keith Richards/Ronnie Wood.  <BR>One final note, few rock and roll albums sound as great as this record does when &quot;played at maximum volume&quot;, particularly Strawman.  This is such a pure rock and roll record, it will never date itself.

0446310786|5.0|They say that \\"The Adventures of Huck Finn\\" is the classic American tale of racism. Huck Finn seems to be about how rare an island of innocence is in a world beset with wickedness.<br />To Kill a Mockingbird seems to me to be a re-working of that same story but with a different underbelly. This novel believes that there is real goodness, it offers hope in the face of wickedness. You can stay in one place and watch what you thought was so evil evolve into something good. You yourself can find courage you didn't know you had. You might find that you are better than you realized.<br />This book has true humanity in it's core.<br />It's a beautiful story and it is finely crafted as well.<br />The scene at the end with Scout and that person she'd never met but had known all along killed me.
B000065AQU|5.0|I have always loved SOAD.They are brilliant and I can't wait to see what they do next. This Limited edition is a bright shining example of why.This cd is great and with the addition of the DVD which includes Toxicity (video), Chop Suey! (live), Bounce (live),and prison song (live). I've had to buy this cd three times already cause everyone of my friends are constantly trying to steal it. But, everytime I buy it, it keeps getting better and better. And the limited edition metallic blue art on the booklet is pretty neat. I give this version a 5.
B00005OWEG|5.0|This version of Apocalypse Now goes so much further into the insanity of Col. Kurtz.  I truly enjoyed the orginial, but felt that the replaced/added scenes made sense during many scenes from the orginial.  This version lets us see how much Captain Willard (Martin Sheen) truly begins to think more and more like Kurtz.  I love the scene as the helicopter force nears the village, they play Wagner's Ride of the Valkyries on loudspeakers on one of the helicopters. Of course the classic Kilgore lines of \\"Put on psy war ops and make it loud,\\" and \\"I love the smell of Naplam in the Morning. The smell, you know that gasoline smell.  It smells like.....Victory\\"
6302914191|5.0|I waited and waited and waited before I purchased the full set of VHS tapes of this incredible TV show. After all, 80 bucks is a lot of money, for anything. But I finally took the plunge.<br />Watching this series for the first time in over 10 years brought back wonderful memories. And it also gave me more insight into the show, being that I only saw a few of the episodes the first time around. If you have an open mind and enjoy something creative and different, TP is for you.<br />In my original review which I am now editing, the next paragraph described how awful the sound was, and mentioned that the music seemed like it had gone through a Quisenhart several times and was then spat out.<br />Well, I have since bought a new VCR and TV, and found that the music sounds just fine!  So chalk up my original rant to 15-year-old equipment that had started to show its age.  <br />The picture still isn't that great--those browns and reds still tend to bleed a lot.  But if you can ignore this fault, TP is still a thing of beauty. But I've heard a lot of good things about DVD quality, so when I stop waiting and finally buy a DVD player, I'm going to get those discs and enjoy a crystal-clear picture, at last.
B00005KHLV|4.0|A love story, set in Hong Kong in the 60's.  This is a slow moving film, but it is never boring.  It is like an antidote to violent MTV jump cuts, the scenes are drawn out and atmospheric.  The soundtrack is paired down, so that there are plenty of times in the film when silence combined with subtly understated body language and visually beautiful sets create timeless moments.  The director uses strange angles to film the main two characters, never settling for formulaic camera work, always looking for novelty, without detracting from the main storyline.                                                                 <BR>          The soundtrack uses a violin and string refrain, which is played repeatedly.  This works very well, it tends to absent time from the proceedings by condensing the whole film into one archetypal moment.  All this may make the film sound pretentious (or maybe just my review), but it is anything but.  It is about two people coming together and the depth of feeling that is shared between them.<BR>          Hong Kong is presented as an old and decrepit city, that has not lost it's beauty.  There are similarities to the film 'The Straight Story' by David Lynch, in that the director is able to transmute the ordinary into the transcendent.  The final scene in Angkor Wat (Cambodia) with strings playing underneath the view of the incredible architecture and sense of place, is as perfect cinema as you are ever likely to see.
B00005YXZH|5.0|Hey Wilco fans, I just want to ask all of you who have been enjoying this album since it became available in mp3 format several months ago to please buy a real copy. Or buy a couple and give them to people who you think might appreciate them. For one thing, with the intricate sound of this album, there's a real noticeable difference from the mp3.<br />Also, I for one am tired of seeing the blank stares from cool people who have good music taste when I tell them who my favorite band is. They'll never be superstars or anything (god hope), but it would be great to see the band really back up the incredible reviews and publicity they are getting with some solid album sales numbers. I'm wondering if YHF might have a chance to beat Summerteeth sales to date in its first week of release!<br />And for people who haven't heard of Wilco, but are hearing/reading about them all over the place all of a sudden, a couple thoughts - 1) &quot;Heavy Metal Drummer&quot; is a bit of an exception to the feel of the rest of the album. I personally like the song, but if you're thinking about buying this album on that song alone, be ready for a wide-ranging listening experience. 2) If you have seen the phrase &quot;Alt-Country&quot; and that makes you lean towards &quot;no thanks&quot; on buying this album, you shouldn't worry. I was never any kind of country fan before, and I loved Wilco when I got their first album &quot;A.M.&quot; several years ago - which anyone would now call Wilco's most twangy album and far different from their music today.<br />I don't consider them anything other than great artists, a great band. A band better than any labels you can put on them.
B00005V3Z4|4.0|\\"Donnie Darko\\" is precisely the kind of movie that becomes a cult classic. No one saw in the theater, but once people like you and me get their hands on it in the video store, we make damn sure all our friends see it.<br />The coolest thing about \\"Donnie Darko\\" is that it's a bonafide independent sci-fi film. This movie has some impressive visuals and visual effects, and it was all made on a $4.5 million budget. Of course, when Drew Barrymore is your executive producer, I bet you get some deals and steals here and there...but it's still amazing that this film cost so little to make.<br />Jake Gyllenhall is wonderful as the title character; somehow, the kid who stooped to the all-time low of \\"Bubble Boy\\" is able to carry a mind-bending genre film with a large cast of good actors.<br />The film itself is at once hysterical and depressing; realistic and surreal; frustrating and accommodating. It's certainly an original work from a first time director, and a film that will certainly leave you with more questions than answers. And that's not necessarily a bad thing. Any movie that requires you to think about it well after the credits roll is doing something right. \\"Donnie Darko\\" and Spielberg's \\"A.I. Artificial Intelligence\\" have more than a little in common -- both deal with issues that are bigger than us, both have an ending that can be thought of as both happy and sad, and both still haunt me to this day.<br />Don't miss \\"Donnie Darko.\\"
B00005UEAR|5.0|Like everybody else, I thought it would be impossible for Dream Theater to top their conceptual masterpiece SCENES FROM A MEMORY. I mean, come on, it's a perfect record all the way through, and I recently bought the live DVD of SFAM in concert which just floored me to say the least. With that in mind, I'm sure every DT fan out there (including myself) was a bit curious to see how the follow-up was going to measure up. It's safe to say, in this reviewer's humble opinion, that the greatest prog. band of them all have actually done it. Although they didn't come close to topping SCENES, Dream Theater have done just fine with their monumental double-disc set SIX DEGREES OF INNER TURBULENCE (wow! that's a long title!). I didn't like it all that much at first, but repeated listenings have made me realize the sheer depth, creativity, and power that runs throughout the two discs. This is one DT's finest albums. Period.<br />Disc 1 is composed of five lengthy songs that end all too quickly. \\"The Glass Prison\\" is pure Dream Theater - a 14-minute heavy metal beast that is also their most ear-shattering song to date. DT have written really heavy songs in the past like \\"The Mirror\\" and \\"Beyond This Life,\\" but those songs had little melodic breaks that allowed you to catch your breath. Not so here. \\"TGP\\" is relentlessly energetic from beginning to end. The sinister back-and-forth vocals of James LaBrie and Mike Portnoy are amazing, and the instrumental section is their best ever. The dueling guitar/keyboard solo by Petrucci and Rudess is insanely complex, John Myung's bass solo rocks, and there's Portnoy's heavy, galloping drums in the background. Overall, an outstanding epic.<br />\\"Blind Faith\\" follows and is equally fantastic. DT has always been known for the amount of melody they put in their songs, and it's clearly in top form on this 10-minute piece. LaBrie not only proves that he's a great singer but also a great lyricist. His lyrics are very deep and powerful. He surprisedthe hell out of me. This track also has one of the most hypnotic intros ever recorded, beginning with Rudess's haunting synth wash that is followed by Myung's de-tuned bass, the killer grooves of Portnoy, and one of Petrucci's best riffs. Heavy and catchy.<br />\\"Misunderstood\\" is both the most beautiful song they've done as well as the most bizarre. This is where DT cranks the experimental factor to a tilt. It starts out quiet and slow for the first three minutes or so with an acoustic melody that smacks of old Zeppelin. You think it's going to be a simple ballad, but then Petrucci lashes out with a heavy guitar break and Queen-esque solo that is purposely out of place. His lyrics on this track are also good. Listen to the chorus. Unbelievable. The song ends with a psychotic wah-wah pedal attack and creepy keyboards.<br />\\"The Great Debate\\" is the second 14-minute monster on this disc. A lot of people don't seem to like it because of the Tool influence (mostly in the first few vocals), but this epic has more in common with Rush's \\"Natural Science\\" than Tool. Petrucci's lyrics on this deal with the ever-growing cloning debate and its effects on society. Although Portnoy has said in many interviews that John was writing from both sides, it's clear he's on the pro-life side and he lets the \\"white coat heroes\\" have it. Really powerful stuff. Excellent keyboard solo by Jordan and nice double-bass work from Portnoy.<br />\\"Disappear\\" is the most underrated song on this disc. Some love it, others hate it. I'm in the former. It's not their best ballad (that would be \\"The Spirit Carries On\\"), but it's definitely an emotional power trip. A lot have compared this to Radiohead and Kevin Moore's earlier \\"Space-Dye Vest,\\" but the backwards tape loops and weird heartbeat effects remind me of the Beatles during their SGT. PEPPER heyday. LaBrie's lyrics are also different, as the depressed character in the song finds hope at the end of the tunnel. A very nice mellow tune. LaBrie shines on this one.<br />So ends Disc 1 of SIX DEGREES...but wait, there's more! Tune in tomorrow when I review Disc 2 which contains the band's magnum opus title track, the 42-minute \\"Six Degrees of Inner Turbulence.\\" See you later!
0345448898|5.0|I have for many years been looking for a fantasy story that does something new. I recently found just that. Mr. Pullman writes in a wonderful style and is wildly imaginative in creating a rich tapestry of parallel worlds through which the characters of this trilogy travel. A book many think is for adolescents, I highly recommend this book to readers of any age who are looking for something captivating, and unique.
B00005UEAR|5.0|In honor of Dream Theater's latest 2-disc set SIX DEGREES OF INNER TURBULENCE, I have divided my epic review into two parts.  The first review, written on April 25th, was based solely on Disc 1.  For the second review, I'm going to talk about Disc 2, which contains the band's sprawling 42-minute composition \\"Six Degrees of Inner Turbulence.\\"  Although I'll be the first to admit that this epic isn't quite as consistent or awe-inspiring as the 77-minute SCENES FROM A MEMORY or even their previous 23-minute suite \\"A Change of Seasons,\\" \\"Six Degrees...\\" is a great song in its own right.  This is where Dream Theater pays tribute to their various influences.  There's so much diversity here that it's impossible to describe so I'll put it this way: combine the styles of Yes, Elton John, Metallica, Pink Floyd, Genesis, and Rush and stir it up to create a potent musical stew.<br />The eight movements are separated (kind of) into eight related songs that flow from one to the other a là DARK SIDE OF THE MOON.  Each of them focus on six different people with six different forms of mental illness.  They are: a so-called \\"perfect\\" woman suffering from a nervous breakdown (\\"About to Crash\\"); a tortured Vietnam veteran (\\"War Inside My Head\\"); a crazed mental patient who thinks he's a rock star (\\"The Test that Stumped Them All\\"); a mother painfully grief-stricken over the death of her little girl (\\"Goodnight Kiss\\"); a reclusive boy who grows up to be a paranoid man (\\"Solitary Shell\\"); and a woman who has a habit of dressing in black everyday (\\"Losing Time/Grand Finale\\").<br />Similar to what they did on SFAM, the band constantly changes throughout the opus with countless moods and rapid time signatures, knowing the balance between happiness, sadness, darkness, anger, and confusion.  \\"Overture\\" kicks things off and this is where Jordan really shows his talent on the keyboard.  The entire piece is played like a hair-raising film soundtrack mostly dominated by Rudess and his endlesslyinventive, fluid playing.  Not their best instrumental, but definitely the most creative.  \\"About to Crash\\" follows and it's melodic progressive rock at its best.  After the brief heavy rocker \\"War Inside My Head,\\" the next three movements are the defining moments of this epic.<br />\\"The Test that Stumped Them All\\" rivals \\"Glass Prison\\" in terms of sheer sonic heaviness with guitar licks and snare drumming so fast it's likely to make your finger press the `repeat' button over and over again.  James LaBrie switches his voice around on this part, sounding very menacing as the mental patient, donning a phony British accent as the doctor curing him, and using an extremely high pitch as the nurses.  Incredible work.  Must be a great live song.  The ending makes me crazy.<br />\\"Goodnight Kiss\\" is an emotional, almost psychedelic-like ballad that is the tear-jerking high point of the suite.  James sounds really into it and he makes you feel the emotion.  The main theme comes back and it almost made me cry (seriously).  John Petrucci delivers one of his best guitar solos ever at the end.  Very blues-inspired and just heart-wrenching.<br />\\"Solitary Shell\\" is the closest this band has come to writing a simple, ordinary pop song.  Undoubtedly the catchiest thing DT has ever done, it's highlighted by the energetic acoustic guitar of Petrucci, Jordan's standout synth solo, and James's passionate singing.  The lyrics are excellent.  Certainly the most intelligent pop song you'll ever hear.<br />\\"About to Crash (Reprise)\\" is basically a harder-rocking repeat of the second movement.  I like it better than the original.  Petrucci's intro is just bad-[rear].  The musicianship is really great, too.  \\"Losing Time/Grand Finale\\" reprises the main theme and gets higher and higher towards a powerful conclusion which brings everything that happened before into perspective.  After Portnoy crashes the gong, the notes wander for about another minute or so.  Funny how both discs end with Beatles references.<br />So there you have it.  Two discs and 96 minutes worth of some of the best music ever done.  I hope you enjoyed this two-part review.  If I gave away too much information let me know, but it was worth it describing this incredible two-disc set.  SIX DEGREES OF INNER TURBULENCE is yet another crowning achievement in Dream Theater's canon.  I can't wait to see what these guys are gonna do next!
B00005QHPQ|5.0|Contrary to what one might think in seeing Enrique on the cover of the May issue of YM magazine, his music appeals to a wider audience than the tenni-bopper set.  He sings HERO with a passion and tenderness that would appeal to fans of Johnny Mathis.  Unlike some albums, Escape's sellections all have an appealing quality, with their up-beat tempo and catchy rhythms. The listner won't have to fast-forward to get to the &quot;good&quot; song.  And how cleaver of Enrique to repetitively wail &quot;you can run&quot; a the closing of ESCAPE  That has become a signiture phrase of that song that stays in the listner's mind  He is a love song crooner whose style evokes the romantic in all of us.
B00005N5S5|5.0|First of all i would just like to say that The Terminator is a masterpiece that will never die, and i agree with you guys when you say that it is way better than the second film...<BR>At first you think that this is suppose to be the final battle of man vs. machine and that the terminator was sent there to kill Sarah and Kyle was sent there to protect her, but as in every true time travel paradox movie there is a second meaning to the film...<BR>The Terminator's arrival to the present is what created SKYNET and Kyle Reese's arrival to the present is what gave life to John Connor.  So in reality this is not the final battle for mankind, this is the battle that started it all... cool huh...<BR>And now a note from me to all you fans that haven't found the dvd eggs yet.   THERE ARE TWO DVD EGGS.  BOTH ARE ON SIDE 1 OF THE T1 DVD.  ONE IS HIDDEN IN THE LANGUAGES, GO TO THE SELECTION FOR EITHER THE FRENCH OR THE SPANISH LANG.

YOU CAN DO THIS TO SEE 5 DIFFERENT PIC/AUDIO TRACKS WHERE CAST AND CREW MEMBER TELL ABOUT MEMORIES FROM THE SET.<BR>THE SECOND DVD EGG IS FOUND IN THE SPECIAL FEATURES/DVD ROM PART.  I GAVE THE FIRST ONE TO YOU SO YOU SHOULD BE ABLE TO FIND THIS ONE...
B00005UW7G|4.0|The new DVD release of this Mozart masterpiece has been considerably improved over the VHS and laserdisc versions. The picture which has an aspect ratio of 1.66:1 has been digitally remastered and the improvements are readily apparent. The yellow subtitles (in six languages including English) are now much more legible.<BR>In previous versions of this opera, especially the laserdisc, the quality of the audio was very poor indeed -- in particular, the distortion of much of the singing was terrible throughout. Unfortunately, the audio in the new DVD edition is still flawed to some degree. For most of the first half of the opera the ambience of the singing is unnatural and far too distant. The singers sound as if they were in cavernous recording studio. Fortunately, in the last half the situation improves and the singing matches the video much more realistically. The orchestra sounds fine throughout and Maazel conducts with a marked dramatic intensity. There is no 2-channel PCM audio track and the Dolby Surround which is present is not that great.<BR>I consider this to be the most exciting and powerful video version of this opera, notwithstanding the problems outlined above. Compared to the other DVD versions filmed on a stage this one is vastly superior because in part of the magnificent atmospheric settings offered by Vincenza and the superlative singing.
B000059TEQ|1.0|I bought this for my mother, who likes weepy, maudlin stuff like this. Feh! This type of film make's my skin itch, it is a classic weepy film, chock full of cliches. This is the Holy Grail of weepy melodramas. Enjoy.
0385505833|1.0|I hate to give a bad review, but I am bound by honesty to say that this is the worst, most frustrating book I've read in quite some time. I picked it up, humbug that I am, thinking \\"Finally, someone who understands that Christmas is a lot of commercial nonsense\\" I was disappointed to find that the characters (including the main characters) were a perfect stereotype of everything I hate about America. Bear in mind that this review is based on partial knowledge. I didn't read the whole book, as I became so angry with the characters' stupidity around chapter fifteen that I hurled the book across the room. I picked it up later and read the last few pages. The story resolves nicely, and, for some, the tension before the release might prove an effective literary tool, but, as I said, I despised everything about these chracters and could bear no more.
B000001F9E|5.0|arguable BEST ROCK ALBUM OF ALL TIME!!!  This is my favorite rock-n-roll album.  Powerfully intense tracks like \\"Warriors,\\" \\"Cowboy Song,\\" \\"Emerald,\\" and \\"Jailbreak\\" make this album an absolute knock-out.  Every song moves and puts chills up the spine, including the softer love-songs.  This album has passionate composition, vocals, and signature dueling electric-guitar harmonies (which influenced so many other bands). <BR>I have listened to this album several times a year for fourteen  years now (since I was 13.see Cowboy Song).  Henry Rollins also said this is one of his favorite albums.  It has such a Southern feel to it.  This album did so much to influence duelling-guitar heavy-metal bands.  Reinforcing the soulfulness of the album is the fact that Thin Lizzy were from Dublin, Ireland.  In fact, \\"Emerald\\" is a parable about the military conquests for Ireland by the English and the Saxons.   Erin Go' Bragh!
0451167716|5.0|I came to read 'The Godfather' after recently viewing the classic film series about a mafia family, the Corleones, and their stuggle for power and survival in the face of the violent world of crime to which they belong. I was hoping that the book would expand on the characterisations and plot lines portrayed on the screen. The book did not disappoint. It is fast paced, full of suspense, and develops a host of interesting characters.<br />The central character is Don Vito Corleone, the head of the Corleone family. He is the 'Godfather', a powerful patriarch who has refused to allow society to bend him to its will. Instead he has constructed his own society where 'respect', 'honour', and above all 'family' are the key notes. But this Sicilian counter-culture is a violent one, and power has its price. Don Corleone is the victim of an assassination attempt which threatens the destruction of all he holds dear.<br />The most pleasing thing about the book is Puzo's style, descriptive, yet very tight. He is essentially a master story teller. I am ignorant as to how faithfully he presents the Mafia world, but there are no holds barred in his realism about violence, ruthlessness, and brutality. His depiction is a chilling and thoroughly gripping read. A brilliant feature are the cameo tales of the story's lesser lights, such as Luca Brasi, Lucy Mancini, and Amerigo Bonasera. These add a depth and richness to the tale Puzo weaves.<br />The only negative note for me was the fairly frequent and graphic depiction of sex. Of course, Puzo's frankness about this is fully in keeping with his treatment of violence and the like, but it was just a little much for my taste at times.<br />'The Godfather' is very exciting, though not profound. A Classic of its type.
B00005JKQZ|5.0|This movie has a little bit of everything- creativity, romance, a love that truly is for better or for worse, suspense, action, and taste. I have to admit- before this movie, I was never really a Russell Crowe fan, due in part to his reputation for being arrogant and obnoxious. I really went to see the movie because Jennifer Connelly and I are the same age and I grew up seeing her face in Sears' catalogs, never having seen any of her acting performances. But when I saw Russell and the enormity of acting talent he put forth in this movie, I was completely blown away. How wrong I was for opinionating myself and using my opinion to decide whether or not I would see any of his movies. This movie impressed me so much that I went out and rented all the Russell Crowe movies available to me, and all I can say is: Boy have I missed out through the years. His true personality radiates in every character he plays, and he was surely the right choice for the lead in \\"A Beautiful Mind\\". Jennifer Connelly was outstanding as Alicia Nash, and together, her and Russell were a \\"Beautiful Pair\\". Paul Bettany was also great. I would definitely recommend this movie to anyone in any age group, due in large part to the message it conveys- a beautiful mind, a mind that can appreciate the deeper things that most of us can't,<BR>can be a troubled one, and those closest to that\\"beautiful mind\\" should never give up hope and keep close in mind the important things in life- compassion, long-suffering, and most of all--LOVE.
B00004Z459|5.0|When they started playing \\"One Step Closer\\" on the radio, I didn't like the song at all, and I wondered why everyone was making such a big deal out of this group. Then I heard \\"Crawling\\" and I liked it, and then I heard \\"In The End\\" and I really liked that song, in fact I haven't gotten tired of it yet after hearing it about 500 times. Another one of my favorites is \\"Papercut\\". I totally misjudged these guys. I absolutely love Chester's voice, very sexy, and Mike has the perfect voice for rapping. I think these guys are talented, and you know I personally think they aren't like every other band out there. They're the exception. I normally wouldn't like rap/rock music, but because it's Linkin Park, I love it!
B00005QIPH|2.0|The music is simple basic pop that has been done a million times.  If you enjoy overplayed, mundane music then this may be just the disc for you.  I would rather buy material from the bands that wrote this music 20 years ago.
B0000648WZ|1.0|Starship Troopers is one of those books I read every year or two, and one of those films I never want to see again.  The film omits character development altogether, so you never get to know Juan Rico, the main protagonist of the book, and ignores completely the thrust of the story, which is Mr. Rico's growth from a pup to a leader of men. I was especially bothered by the films cavalier attitude with regard to violence and sexual morality, which were the opposite of what Robert Heinlein's novel depicted --  a futuristic society that goes back to simpler, stricter mores.
B00000IQC8|5.0|If you have yet to even see \\"Clerks\\" on video or TV, (and if you say it on TV, I just hope it was on HBO or something that won't edit it) what are you waiting for?  You have deprived yourself of one of the best indie films of the 1990s, not to mention one of the better gut buster comedies ever!  \\"Clerks\\" is the first (major) project by Kevin Smith and it follows the lives of a few New Jersey based characters, but mainly Dante.  Dante is a clerk in a convenience store and he pretty much hates his miserable job, which is destroying him slowly.  His spicy little girlfriend encourages him to go back to school.  Randal, his outspoken best friend and a worker at the video store next door, tires to help out his bud but often helps to paint Dante into a corner.  Also, Randal's definition of friendship is wavy. You wouldn't think that a little quick-stop store would be much for an exciting adventure, but craziness does ensue as both Dante and Randal meet an annoying cast of customers (most notably Jay and Silent Bob) and somehow manage to squeeze a hockey game and a funeral into the day.  And I haven't even told you just some of the snide sarcastic jabs that keep getting thrown around.  Comedy is a defense mechanism and it works! <BR>  <BR>The great thing about Clerks is that it doesn't try for cheap laughs, yet just every movement and line is great comedy.  Of course, its not like \\"Clerks\\" is a drama, but its just that nearly everything about it gets you.  Yes, it's all in a rough black and white and the budget is nill, but the material is so strong that it doesn't matter!  \\"Clerks\\" is the rare gem of a comedy that, luckily, never got a real squeal.  There was the little seen yet entreating \\"Clerks\\" cartoon, but it really left you wanting more.  Of course, Kevin did continue to use the characters again (Jay and Silent Bob mostly), but never totally rehashed the Clerks story that much.  \\"Clerks\\", the movie is classically irreverent and real, not like most of the insufferablesight gag shtick that people are so attracted to.  The DVD has a hilarious audio commentary, a Soul Asylum video (ah, remember them!) and deleted scenes and s shocking alternate ending.  The audio commentary is funny and gives us a lot of insight as to how the movie was made, some of the people in it and give us a few laughs along the way.  A complete DVD to go with one of the most memorable little films ever.
B00003CXZ4|5.0|By now you've probably already heard about how awesome this movie is from your friends, or chances are you wouldn't be looking at this movie. That's how I found out about it. You've probably also already read the basic setup from other reviews, so i won't bore you with the redundancies of repeating the plot overview. This movie is probably the most fun i've had the movies in years. The plot draws you in, Guy Pierce's performances keeps you in, and the questions left by the movie's &quot;ending&quot; leave you wanting to see it again. And, if you do buy it, you will see something new every time you watch it. Every little intricacy and subtle nuance you find will answer a question, but at the same time, bring up at least two new ones. You are left ot draw your own conclusions about who is on whose side. In conclusion, Memento is an experience, and one not soon to be outdone.
B00005ARDC|4.0|When I first saw there video for \\"love BURNS\\", I only caught the spooky ending with the chick running off into the night. I bought the cd the next day. If you like \\"LOVE burns\\", there are about 9 other worthwhile songs on this release. Peace!
B00004Y6TQ|4.0|The power of the narrative of Lars Von Trier's DANCER IN THE DARK, in which Bjork starred (and performed these songs), seems to have driven the Icelandic alternative queen in her creation of one of the most haunting movie musical scores of all time.  Although a soundtrack more congruent with the actual movie might have been more satisfying, thankfully the brilliant &quot;Overture&quot; has been included.  (See the movie for an awe-inspiring art sequence as the grand overture plays).  Bjork has not been given nearly enough credit for pulling together a magnificent, emotional, vastly colorful work of art in this album.
B00005ARDC|4.0|When I first saw there video for &quot;love BURNS&quot;, I only caught the spooky ending with the chick running off into the night.  Then I caught the rest of the video and thought it was Jeff Tweedy from wilco.  I bought the cd the next day.  If you like &quot;LOVE burns&quot;, there are about 9 other worthwhile songs on this release. Peace!
B00005221M|4.0|Much, much, much better than the book. The only time in Hollywood history has a movie been made that's better than the book. That's all I can say.
B00000064G|5.0|I \\"discovered\\" Nick Drake in a roundabout way, through the fiction of his fellow Brit, author Phil Rickman, who seems to have been profoundly affected by Drake's music.  The only album of his that I could find in print way back then was \\"Way to Blue,\\" a sort of \\"Best of\\" collection.  And I thought that Pink Moon was the best of the songs. when the CD was remastered and released, I bought it,and although this phrase is trite and overused, I was blown away.  I've listened to his first two albums, and read about arguments with his producer about whether or not to add the (unnecessary, IMO)horn and string sections.  Nick, quite correctly, felt his music could stand alone.  Why he was not successful in his lifetime, I'll never know.  I don't think he was having a breakdown as he wrote and recorded \\"Pink Moon,\\" I think he was finally allowing himself to speak without euphemisms or too much symbolism. It is Nick being Nick, and it is his best.  Finally, you can hear his guitar clearly.  Listen closely, and you'll see that he has been sadly underrated; I believe he was the best acoustic guitarist in the 20th century (no offense to Robert Johnson and Eric Clapton fans).  The song \\"Which Will\\" is my favorite track from the CD; the theme of love lost and watching the beloved move on is not unusual, but what he does with it is magical.  I also love \\"Pink Moon;\\"  some months after hearing it, I learned that in British superstition, the sight of a pinkish or reddish full moon means that someone is going to die.  Perhaps a foreshadowing of \\"Black-Eyed Dog\\"?<br />If you only buy one Nick Drake album, make it this one.  You won't regret it.
B00005RY7X|1.0|This is seriously the worst thing I have ever heard. When i hear it, i usually laugh because its so bad that its funny! I can't emphasize any more how dumb and terrible this is...
B00004TWZF|5.0|I only know and love the European version. My best friend and I always debated the end - whether the dolphin brings him back to where he belongs (ie his girl friend and to the earth) or takes him into the depth of the ocean. Does the US version bring light into this? I hear it has a different ending...
B00005QATY|5.0|Saw the movie, rented the video, bought the soundtrack, read the liner notes, rented the video again.  The Coens had the music lined up before the script was complete, and call the movie a &quot;valentine to the music&quot;.  It really is. The video does not give the same visual impact that the theater experience gives, but I think I could watch this movie weekly and still feel uplifted, entertained, and cheered every time.  That's precisely what I want in my movies! Those who didn't laugh must have missed Charles Durning (as Pappy O'Daniel) as he joined the Soggy Bottom Boys onstage.
0060934913|4.0|Being a former waiter in a French restaurant (not a chef), I could easily relate to some of the tales of woe and horror in this very funny, fun to read book. And I even learned something about knives and cooking ingredients. A nice book to blast through on a lazy afternoon.
B00005YXZH|5.0|Sometimes an album comes out that is not only wonderful, but seems to articulate a spirit of the times.  While YFT may not rack up the sales or attention that other 'zeitgeist' albums have (joshua tree, automatic for the people (with which it shares alot)), it is a fine record.  While the tone of the album is quiet, isolated, melancholy, I feel a sense of relief and belonging, when, in these times, I can hear music that lets me know that we share some commonalities.  I am actually spooked that the songs were written and recorded before 9/11, since they seem to capture the world-weariness of this time.<br />I've been listening to the bootleg I've had since last fall, and it continues to grow on me.  The fragile way that songs like 'poor places' fold together into a pop tune is amazing. &quot;war on war&quot; is wonderful and hopeful.  each day, i go to work with a different one of these tunes stuck in my head.  like the line in 'heavy metal drummer': 'i miss the innocence i've known--playing Kiss covers, beautiful and stoned&quot;  While IMHO there are greater heights reached on songs on previous albums Being There and Summer Teeth, both of those masterpieces lack the focus threaded through each song here.  Part of that credit lies with teaming up with the right producer who shares this vision. Well-crafted modern folk tunes are obscured with keyboard, feedback and studio distortions and treatments, resulting in glimmers of brilliance coming together as songs play out. (for a similarly great and stark album, check American Music Club's masterpiece, Mercury, from '94 (?) )<br />this album is wonderful for people who like challenging music that still has pop sensibilities.  It's feeling, like the cover photo, is one of casting a tired eye on the modern american landscape: gas stations, pop music, concrete buildings, ATMs, and our place among them.  And finding beauty anyway.
0783235607|5.0|Alfred Hitchcock's 1960 masterpiece PSYCHO remains a groundbreaking horror movie to this very day despite the thousands of imitators it has spawned in the last four decades. It was with this film that the horror genre, thought to consist of inhuman monsters and dark, stormy castles, entered the modern age and forced filmmakers to look at humanity's darker side with a contemporary look.<br />By now, of course, everyone knows the story: A woman (Janet Leigh) ends up stealing $40,000 from her boss, drives from Phoenix to Central California to meet with her lover (John Gavin) but never makes it thanks to the \\"interference\\" of a motel clerk (Antohny Perkins) and his \\"mother.\\" Even to this day, however, one can ingeniously look at Hitchcock's film and admire not only the shocks, including the still-potent shower murder, but also the director's deliciously morbid style of black comedy. Perkins made his character Norman Bates into a household work for Madness, and Bernard Herrmann provided us with his celebrated shrieking score, done entirely with strings.<br />The film also marked a point at which the horror film would really tackle subjects that were taboo before--psychology, madness, murder (more explicitly than before) and even necrophilia. This is because the film, scripted by Joseph Stefano from Robert Bloch's novel of the same name, has its roots in the case of the ghoulish Wisconsin mass murderer Ed Geinn, which would also provide inspiration for the 1974 cult classic THE TEXAS CHAINSAW MASSACRE. These elements have helped make PSYCHO a legendary film in ways that the vast number of its imitators could never be. It's intelligent, scary, and unsettling even after endless imitations and such. Even the seemingly unnecessary intrusion of the psychiatrist (Simon Oakland) at the end is far less bothersome than it seems. He gives us a good idea of what sort of a person Norman is: \\"He was never all Norman. But he was often ONLY MOTHER.\\"<br />For horror and thriller fans, PSYCHO is an absolutely essential addition to your collection if you don't already have it. Pick up this one-of-a-kind masterpiece now!
B00005JKYS|5.0|\\"We Were Soldiers\\" is based on the events of a 3 day spell behind enemy lines in North Vietnam in Nov 1965.  It details the actual accounts of battle from the viewpoint of the man who led the 7th Airborne Cavalry and the man who saw them in action.  Lt. Col 'Hal' Moore formed a new division, trained to enter hostile territory and \\"find and kill the enemy.\\"  Their mission in November 1965 was to do just that, but against a force of unknown strength. He led his troops into battle, led them during the battle and fortunatley led what remained alive afterwards home to the USA after a complete tour-of-duty.  This film showed a battlefield as a cruel and violent place, men dying on either side, yet risking all to protect their comrades, the ethos of the 7th. It showed the brass-tacks of warfare too, re-supply by heroic chopper pilots in one scene, and the wives at home keeping themselves occupied to stop thinking of their men dying thousands of miles away - then the telegrams started arriving. A great movie in the finest traditions of such as \\"The Green Berets\\" or \\"The Longest Day\\" I loved every minute of it.
B00005R2M3|3.0|I have been a fan of Shakira since Pies Descalzos.  Even though this is a good record, it could have been better.  There are a few standout tracks like &quot;Underneath Your Clothes&quot;, &quot;Whenever, Wherever&quot;,&quot;The One&quot;, and &quot;Te Dejo Madrid&quot;.  Sometimes her English is a bit confusing, although I think she needs time.  Still, if you want to hear her best work, listen to the album &quot;Dnde estn los ladrones?&quot;.  To me, this album truly demostrates what she's capable of writing.
B00003CXTG|4.0|&quot;Titanic&quot; meets &quot;Tora! Tora! Tora!&quot; early in &quot;Pearl Harbor&quot; - validating the comments of other reviewers about this film exploiting cliches and past cinematic successes.  As this grafting of epic romance onto dramatised history approaches its expected conclusion and the unsuspecting audience senses the end credits, the film launches into a reprise of &quot;Thirty Seconds Over Tokyo&quot;.<br />&quot;Pearl Harbor&quot; is a formula movie in which new ideas are hard to find, but who cares?  It is very entertaining and well-made.  Its tribute to the spirit of the times is largely satisfying.  It has a good cast, with the biggest names in supporting roles, including Jon Voight's portrayal of Franklin D. Roosevelt, Alec Baldwin's of Lt Colonel Doolittle, and Dan Aykroyd's of a US Navy codebreaker.  Clever market-orientated art direction and design give it a period look extending to 1940s-style brassieres-but perhaps shying clear of alienating modern tastes by going all the way with 1940s hair styles.<br />Bonus materials in the DVD package include a &quot;making of&quot; documentary with insights into the state-of-the-art stunts and special effects.  Among the most impressive special effects is a convincing integration of computer graphics with the actual location of Pearl Harbor and with real sets, ships and aircraft.  Modern buildings are edited out frame-by-frame.  The &quot;making of&quot; documentary shows just how life-like computer-generated people, aircraft and ships have become.  The image and Dolby 5.1 sound quality are as sharp as we now should expect from every new DVD release.
B000002P5W|5.0|Although it's not as groundbreaking and Jimi Hendrix debut \\"Are You Experienced\\" or even his spacey masterpiece \\"Electric Ladyland\\".  Axis:Bold As Love resonates some sort of strange feel that the other two albums do not have.  That does not make this a better album then the other two but when I first threw this into my cd player I knew from the beginning this album had a way different feel.<br />The opening track EXP is a novelty tune where Hendrix messes around on his guitar.  It's not exactly a classic Hendrix track but this was the strange feel I was talking about.  UP FROM THE SKIES is the first actual song on this album.  It really suprised me the first time I heard it cause it was strange to hear this R&B sound from Jimi Hendrix!  SPANISH CASTLE MAGIC is classic Hendrix.  WAIT UNTIL TOMMORROW was a hit.  AIN'T NO TELLING is a fast paced fun rocker.  LITTLE WING is a classic one of my favourite Hendrix tunes!  IF 6 WAS 9 is another huge hit that is the longest track on this album clocking at five minutes and thirty-two seconds.  YOU GOT ME FLOATIN' is an interesting tune.  CASTLES MADE OF SAND is another awesome track here.  SHE'S SO FINE is Noel Redding's vocal debut.  ONE RAINY WISH is a gorgeous classic.  LITTLE MISS LOVER is another favourite among many.  BOLD AS LOVE closes this strange album with a slow bluesy feel.<br />Suprisingly this album clocks relatively shorter than Hendrix' other efforts.  Whereas Are You Experienced and Electric Ladyland both clock arounf an hour to seventy five minutes, Axis clock just under forty minutes!  Does this make the album weak?  No but in my opinion it is Hendrix weakest album but it is still incredibly strong!<br />Overall Axis Bold As Love is an essential Jimi Hendrix album.  Sure it's not as great as his debut or his final studio album but none the less it remains a classic and no Hendrix fan should be without it!  Highly recommended!
B000002UB3|5.0|(First of all, I suggest those reviewers who compare the Beatles to N'Sync, Backstreet Boys, etc. to get a grip. Just because a band writes music for a popular audience does not make that music automatically bad, nor does it take into account the<BR>that the Beatles played their own instruments, wrote their own songs, developed one of the first concept albums, and so on.)<br />  It should be acknowledged that in their era, mid-late <BR>1960s, the Beatles were not the greatest musicians. <BR>Surely, George Harrison was no Jimi Hendrix. Ringo starr <BR>was no Mitch Mitchell or Bill Bruford. Detractors waste <BR>no time in pointing this out, and perhaps rightly so, <BR>since I think that fans tend to overrate the Beatles' musicianship.<br />  So why do I love the Beatles if they were overrated<BR>musicians? Their brilliant songwriting! As far as pop <BR>songcraft goes, there's none greater. Dozens and <BR>dozens of gorgeous melodies, delightfully surreal <BR>lyrical images, harmony upon harmony, and a constant<BR>mix of styles. Listening to the music on 'Abbey Road', I <BR>find it impossible to care that Harrison is not<BR>Hendrix. I am too in love with the exquisite moods <BR>he is creating on 'Something' and 'Here Comes the Sun.' I <BR>will now review each track separately.<br />  'Come Together'<br /> This song isn't really about anything. It combines<BR>brilliant stream of consciousness phrasing (\\"He want<BR>spinal clacker\\") with a catchy melody and chorus. You<BR>never hear pop music this clever on the radio anymore.<br />  'Something'<br /> One of Harrison's premier love songs, the lyrics are<BR>an ode to romantic idealism, and the melody has a <BR>divine quality. Harrison's voice has also never been <BR>more haunting.<br />  'Maxwell's Silver Hammer'<br /> Novelty song about a serial killer by Paul. Features some<BR>of the first synth ever on an album. I love it, personally,<BR>but it offends some listeners.<br />   'Oh Darling!'<br /> Intense 1950s style doo-wop with some screaming vocals. Something of a filler song and there's not much to say<BR>about it.<br />  'Octopus Garden'<br /> This is more of a children's song than anything else. Catchy<BR>tune and listenable, with something of a country/western<BR>flavor.<br />  'I Want You (She's So Heavy)'<br />  Long, droning, monotonous, bluesy rock about intense sexual <BR>lust. Either you'll catch the groove here or you'll be annoyed, but kudos to the great drum, bass, and keyboard work.<br />  'Here Comes the Sun'<br />  Not quite as haunting as 'Something' but a still a fabulous<BR>Harrison love song. I think it is about a frigid woman<BR>finally 'opening up.'<br />  'Because'<br />  This song works as a kind of bridge between 'Here Comes<BR>the Sun' and 'You Never Send Me Your Money.' Incredibly<BR>empty lyrics but the harmonies somewhat make up for that.<br />   'You Never Send Me Your Money'<br />   Drop dead grogeous opening melody here, followed by<BR>an up-tempo bridge to a rocking ending. Paul contributes <BR>some of his best vocals and the \\"1234567 all good children <BR>go to heaven\\" thing is genius. :)<br />  'Sun King Medley'<br />  Epic music finishes out the greatest pop album ever, the<BR>Sun King and Golden Slumbers medleys. Each is an utter<BR>masterpiece with my personal favorite being the former.<BR>The medley opens with the gorgeous, gorgeous, astounding<BR>melody of 'Sun King', and follows into the very catchy<BR>rock of 'Mean Mr Mustard', the proto-punk of 'Polythene<BR>Pam', and the honkey tonk sounding 'She Came in Through<BR>the Bathroom Window.' Not only do they display amazing<BR>versatility in this one group of songs alone, but 'Polythene<BR>Pam' actually reminds me of early David Bowie and <BR>Velvet Underground stuff!<br /> 'Golden Slumbers Medley'<br /> This song set has a coherent theme revolving around sleep and dreaming. Paul's smooth voice adds a lot here, making otherwise banal lyrics such as 'Sleep pretty darling do not cry' into a blissful listening experience. The Beatles get to rock out too, as Harrison and Starr do extended (for them) soloing. Plus,<BR>the reprise of the 'You Never Send Me Your Money' opening<BR>melody is genius. :)<br /> 'Your Majesty'<br /> Just a little ditty to add a humorous punctuation point<BR>to the album. I believe this is the shortest Beatles<BR>song.
0060987464|3.0|I'm a big fan of Manson's music since last summer. I've been wanting to read his book but while reading it, I realized that most of it is just his experiences with drugs (and how they mess up his thinking, his actions, his feelings, and his experiences with bondage and backstage sexual encounters with fans who are willing to be exploited sexually and who enjoy that kind of thing. I didn't learn a whole lot about him as a person except that he enjoys disgusting sexual acts and snorting coke. I thought that buying the book I would receive a lot of insight into his mind but I was disappointed in that. I felt that his writing this book was just a way to make more money off his fans, and to literally disgust everyone. (Which he certainly did). His music still kicks [bootie] in my mind and I don't hate him just because I didn't like his book.
B00003CXMG|5.0|Almost Famous portrays a lost age. An age of innocence and of responsibility. An age of happiness and of anger. An age of music and of everything but music. <br />   It's the early 70's and 15 year old William Miller(Fugit) is infatuated by the immense world of rock and roll music. Such obsession is brought on by an early experience of his sister leaving home, giving him all her albumns(The Who, Led Zeppelin etc) to let the music set him free from his over-protective mother(McDormand). <br />   Miller follows the example of a cynical battle-hardened music critic Lester Bangs(Hoffman) and his own music reviews get noticed by Rolling Stone magazine. Rolling Stone, unaware of the fact he's 15, sends Miller on tour with &quot;Stillwater&quot; a ficticious band that might as well be a real one as it is portrayed expertly without cliches. On the road, he meets Penny Lane(Hudson) Shes not a groupie, shes a band-aid. Penny shows Miller the otherworldness of rock music. She shows him it's heart and soul personified by Stillwater. All the while being checked on by his mother, Miller desperatley tries to get an ever-growing story into Rolling stone on time. A crucial element to said story is an interview with the elusive yet emotional guitarist Russell Hammond(Crudup) The conflicts between the members of the band and the ever-present hysteria of 70's rock and roll bombard Miller in this powerful film with a wonderful pace and brilliant performances. The 70's will never return. This lifestyle will never return. And this film brings it all together to tell us the true story.
B00000IP3S|5.0|This album is a pure masterpiece by Blind Guardian.  Produced by the great Flemming Rasmussen (Metallica's best producer), this album shows BG at the peak of their compositional skills. All 9 songs are great, it is full of intensity and melody.  This is Blind Guardian's best album, and only a handful of bands<BR>can dream of making such a masterpiece.
B0000639FE|2.0|A predictable love story with an ending you could see coming with the opening credits. Cruise plays, well, Cruise, as only he can. (The man can't truly act his way out of a paper bag-he is so one-dimensional.) Zellweger carries her role well, and Gooding is excellent. I bought the original DVD version at my wife's request (and she now wonders what she was thinking). At least I didn't waste even more money buying the SE version. I give it 2 stars - one for Zellweger, one for Gooding.<br />That's another thing that frosts me with this industry. They hype the new release, you buy it, and later come out with the SE version. If it's a movie you really want to add to your collection, you get your pocket picked. So, the moral of this story is clear. Don't buy the first version - rent it and wait 6 to 8 months for the better version.<br />Regards to all.
B00003CY6M|5.0|I loved this movie - not since When Harry Met Sally have I (your typical action loving young male) liked a romantic comedy so much. This had to of been the most underrated movie of last year. I 'm buying it and watching it today! I recommend it to everyone - especially those who question the notions of 'fate' and 'weird luck'. Serendipity defines it all and this well writen well acted movie is a must watch.
6303109950|5.0|\\"Tombstone\\" is, without a doubt, the best western flick ever made! Director George P. Cosmatos stages epic gunfight scenes and gives the well-known story a dark edge. But the film is mostly memorable for it's grand cast who put their hearts and souls into their performances: Kurt Russell (\\"Stargate\\"), Val Kilmer (\\"Batman Forever\\"), Michael Biehn (\\"Megiddo: The Omega Code 2\\"), Sam Elliott (\\"Gettysburg,\\" \\"We Were Soldiers\\"), Bill Paxton (\\"Apollo 13,\\" \\"Twister,\\" \\"Titanic\\"), Stephen Lang (\\"Gettysburg,\\" \\"The Amazing Panda Adventure,\\" and the upcoming \\"Gods and Generals\\"), Billy Zane (\\"Titanic,\\" \\"The Phantom\\"), and a short turn-in by legendary actor Charlton Heston (\\"Planet of the Apes,\\" \\"The Ten Commandments,\\" \\"The Greatest Story Ever Told,\\" and \\"Charlton Heston presents The Bible\\"). Watch this film! You'll love it! Grade: A+
B000002LND|5.0|Madonna has proved herself time and time again to be one of the top recording and performing artists of the last 20 years.  This CD is a collection of her greatest hits from the first 10 years.  From Lucky Star and Borderline, to Justify My Love and Rescue Me, this CD not only has a range of works, but proves Madonna's ability to keep her fans entertained with different styles, different subjects and is why this collection belongs in every music fan's library.<br />Her songs are at a mix of different tempos and styles.  The lyrics range from fluffy party songs, to seductive, to serious.  It is this dexterity that causes Madonna's work to be praised as art, not just as pop music.<br />Why 5 stars?:<BR>I don't think there is a person alive who cannot find a Madonna song they don't like.  This CD is a collection of her biggest hits from the first 10 years and shows Madonna's progression over these years from a struggling club singer, to a true artist.
B00001ZWBQ|5.0|I've been a Bee Gees fan for a long time & this concert is EXCELLENT!!!!!!!!  This DVD is the next best thing to actually being there live.  It makes you want to get up & BOOGIE!!
B00004YX39|5.0|Wow this album is an incredible drug, to be enjoyed on so many levels - musical, literary and sociological. And it is a prime example of the subversive nature of SD - spare yet evocative lyrics about controversial subjects presented in a danceable, radio-friendly format.<br />Highlights:<br />Hey Nineteen - this, their biggest radio hit, makes this unapologetically pro-drug statement: \\"the Cuervo Gold, the fine Columbian, make tonight a wonderful thing\\" I heard this one in my local supermarket recently.<br />Gaucho - incredible. How many straight male songwriting teams have written sympathetic and complex lyrics about a gay couple - a wealthy casino man and his boyfriend and their conflict over the boyfriend's sporting with the Gaucho, who wears the boyfriend's \\"spangled leather poncho with the studs that match your eyes\\"? Favorite lyrics: \\"No he can't sleep on the floor, what do you think I'm yelling for?\\" and \\"I'll drop him off near the freeway, doesn't he have a home?\\"<br />And let's not forget the music - the chord change that connects \\"bodacious cowboys\\" and \\"such as your friend will never be welcome here\\" absolutely transports me every single time I hear it. Genius!<BR>BUT not only that - they managed to get this honest and unapologetic snapshot of a homosexual relationship onto commercial radio in 1980.<br />Time out of Mind - Fagen and Becker examine California new-age cults and con men: \\"Keep your eyes on the sky. Put a dollar in the kitty. Don't the moon look pretty?\\" to an infectious medium-tempo quasi-disco beat. And Fagen's delivery of the word \\"Lhasa\\" - the way he stretches the first vowel to signify the con man's attempt to amaze his young audience \\"I am holding a mystical sphere, it's direct from Lhaaahsa\\" is so delightfully Fagen-esque, you can picture what he looked like as he sang it.<br />Third World Man: a story, told slowly and sensuously, of a psychotically paranoid suburban homeowner. He could be living right next door.
B00005U8EM|5.0|In the hands of director, HAROLD RAMIS, a film that could have been dull and depressing, is an imaginative, funny and a surprisingly toughing comedy.  However Groundhog Day is much more than just a funny film, it confronts a whole grey area in mainstream cinema, and is incredibly philosophical.<br />On top of all this, the film boasts some amazing performances.  Most notably Bill Muarry and Andie MacDowell, in the leading roles.  The chemistry between them in unequalled.
B00000APLB|4.0|I really like to hear Keith Richards do that faster live version of \\"Happy\\" in concerts.  This Stones standout represents one of those instances in which a great song is slightly marred by having the studio version (\\"Exile on Main Street\\") performed too slowly. Actually, altho \\"Happy\\" is just right, a few songs on \\"Love You Live\\" are a little too fast, like \\"Get Off of My Cloud\\" and \\"Star Star.\\"  But overall, it's cool--this recording of concerts in Paris and Toronto is fast-paced, potent rock and roll.<br />This set has all the songs you want to hear in a Stones concert, like \\"Honky Tonk Women,\\" \\"You Can't Always Get What You Want,\\" and \\"Tumbling Dice.\\"  Disk Two begins with Chuck Berry, Howlin' Wolf, etc. stuff, like \\"Around and Around\\" and \\"Little Red Rooster.\\"  The sound quality and performance are a bit spotty, but they certainly are not on the last four songs: \\"It's Only Rock 'N Roll,\\" \\"Brown Sugar,\\" \\"Jumpin' Jack Flash,\\" and \\"Sympathy for the Devil.\\"  What better choices to end a Stones concert can there be!  The middle two are the Stones' best rockers ever, in my view, and all four give the band opportunities to open up. This was LP side four in college, and always the choice in parties and car stereos.  The soloing is terrific, again, fast paced, and the band is ever so tight, everything clicking perfectly. Keith Richards and Ron Wood are fabulous on guitar, and there are blistering leads on the last three of the four songs.  Billy Preston shines on keyboards.  \\"Love You Live\\" is great live Stones for sure.
B00003CXB2|5.0|This film, sweeping in its grandeur and subtle in its portrayal, tells the story of T.E. Lawrence in the desert campaign of World War I. It is perhaps the best film David Lean ever made, and certainly one of his most complex. The DVD is rich in supporting materials.
B000063DIR|2.0|Ozzy has never produced a bad album in his career... Until now. I have to say that this tampered-with version of an iconic metal masterpiece is a big dissapointment. They have taken away the epic \\"wall-of-sound\\" mix of Max Norman's production, drained it of reverb and worst of all, TURNED DOWN RANDY RHOAD'S REVERED GUITAR PLAYING IN THE MIX!!! For Godsakes, that's the last thing I would have thought an Ozzy-approved production would allow. Most of the sting and bite of Randy's lead solo's have been dried out and E-Qued down. Bassist Bob Daisley and Drummer Lee Kerslake also don't fare well, THEY'VE ACTUALLY BEEN REPLACED WITH SESSION GUYS!! Daisley's melodic, crucial basslines in \\"Tonight\\" haven't been copied very well. And even Ozzy's vocals have had much of the processing and double-tracking stripped back to give him a more natural-sounding performance. It is this aspect that I am in two minds about. I always thought his voice was a bit too processed on his early solo albums anyway.<br />But LOOK: You guys in the Ozzy and Sharon camp, I don't know what your were thinking, altering this classic, iconic album. Although it's yours to tamper with as you please, you MUST consider the millions of fans, myself included, who grew up with this recording and loved Randy Rhoads. You have drained all color and life from \\"Diary Of A Madman\\". A simple remastering to boost quality and signal-to-noise levels would have sufficed. For examples on how to do re-mastering properly, just listen to the Judas Priest re-master series to hear how it SHOULD be done.<br />My rating gives 2 stars purely as nostalgia for the music itself. I would have given 5 stars if this had been done properly.
0385505833|5.0|Read this fun-filled book if you have a few days. It's lighthearted, funny and gets you back into the Christmas mood! I definately reccomend it to anyone of all ages!

B00005RFQ5|5.0|oh my God,this album is so -like he's any other albums- mind blowing!He always seem 2 able 2 surprise us with his latest work. With Rainbow Children he brought us back 2 the Parliament,Sly & the family stone,etc era!U can feel the retro jazzy funk in this album. The 1st time i hear it,my comment is this album is so earthy,not an album U expected comin from Prince.But that thought just last 4 about 5 second.He's a musical genius, the way he played almost all of the instrument(he didn't play the drums in this album)is so deep 2 the roots of any musical style.The Work pt.1 is now my favorite track 2 listen 2 every morning before i start my activity coz that song is so inspiring,bring my mood 2 the top. Thank U -again- Mr.Prince 4 Ur years of contribution 2 the music.
0060001941|5.0|This book is without a doubt, one of the best stories ever written.  I believe every teenage girl needs to read this story, and mull over its many themes.  When I first read this book, I fell in love with it, and I haven't fallen out of love with it since.  Considering that was almost 10 years ago, I'd have to say that this is definately a work for everyone to check out.
B00003CXPD|5.0|Jamie Bell is pure magic in this wonderful coming-0f-age film that tells the story of a working class English lad who takes up ballet as a way to hone his boxing skills.  In the process, he discovers himself, learnes some valuable life lessons, and fills a deep void left by the death of his beloved mum.  Despite his family's strong objections (and financial straits) Billy ends up studying dance from a local teacher (the effervescent Julie Walters, who won an Oscar nomination for her work here).  Her lessons - both technical and moral - serve as the basis for a devastatingly real connection between Billy and his disgusted macho father.  What ensues is a dramatic comedy that inspires us at every turn without condescension or pity.  The heartening interaction that develops between father and son is truly evocative, especially so for anyone who ever followed (or didn't) their dreams despite their family's objections.  Not only does Billy \\"Dance!!\\" for his supper...he befriends the local outcast gay teenager and copes with questions about his own sexual orientation - heady topics for a movie about a dancing teen.  All of this is handled in a mature, thoughtful manner, which makes the film a visceral, haunting experience.  You can take or leave it's many messages, but theere is no denying its emotional core.<br />It's rare for a movie to challenge social mores and values by focusing on the dominant male principals.  But \\"Billy Elliot\\" succeeds on more levels than other underdog-come-from-behind flicks.  First, its based on a true story and resonates with truth, integrity and spirit.  And, Bell's brash, authentic portrayal is pure magic.  His feet literally take over his soul...he dances in the street, mimmicking Gene Kelly, and in the process taps his way into your heart.  The performance is so accomplished it's a wonder Bell didn't receive an Oscar nomination.  Even Russell Crowe - who won the 2000 BAFTA and Oscar for \\"Gladiator\\" - admitted Bell deserved the BAFTA Prizeinstead.  Having resisted \\"Billy Elliot\\" at the movies, I finally caught it recently on HBO and was taken in immediately.  This is a film your entire family can and should enjoy...if they don't, perhaps a little side trip to an English coal-mining town will help them appreciate this wonderful heartwarming film.  Seriously, in this day and age, every one of us could use more Billy Elliots and fewer Scorpion Kings.  A keeper!
B00004Z4WR|5.0|Gone in 60 seconds boasts Nic Cage as the front man in this car crunching, adrenine pumping action thriller! The plot: Memphis Reins (cage) is told by one of his friends that his kid brother ( Ribisi) has being held captive by a mobster by the name of Raymond Cullertri.Pushed into a corner, Memphis is forced to steal 50 cars in 3 days, igniting his old career and the police are way ahead of him already! Rated pg-13 for language, the sound and photography in this excellent, testostrone pumping movie beat almost all movies in the same area!
B00005JKBC|2.0|Apart from the narrative of the film (which I really enjoyed), the technical design of the DVD (the menus, intro clips, bonus material, soundtracks, etc.) was quite frustrating.  For the intial DVD viewing, all the film montage multimedia effects involved in navigating the menus was somewhat entertaining.  But, after the initial viewing, all this repeated material felt like a force-feeding.  Also, the design of the soundtracks prevents the viewer from changing the languages/surround sound/director's commentary/subtitles at will through standard DVD controls.  Instead, one must always go back to the overly elaborate menus (more film montage repeats) for any simple change, which quickly becomes quite tedious.  Lastly, I would like to mention that the so-called &quot;Alternate Ending&quot; is identical to the &quot;Theatrical Release Ending&quot; with the exception of different background music.  Certainly not worth buying for the &quot;Alternate Ending&quot; bonus material.
B0000028RR|5.0|Someone once confessed their envy of Jimmy Page because he'd written *all* the good guitar riffs, leaving nothing for the rest of us.  Well, Rage Against The Machine appears to have stumbled on Jimmy's secret stash of leftovers.  But calling these riffs leftovers is doing them an injustice.  Each is a behemoth of intensity and groove, while being surprisingly simple and eminently catchy.  They form a solid foundation for each song, easily allowing the rest of the band to fall into lock-step formation when needed, but also allowing ample room for variation.  And each song is made up of at least four or five of them, all as strong as the first, to create epic five-minute-plus \\"agit-pop\\" tunes.<br />When he's not anchoring the band with those regal riffs, Tom Morello is coaxing previously unheard of sounds from his Frankenstein guitar.  \\"No samples, keyboards or synthesizers used in the making of this recording,\\" claims the liner notes, and it's for Morello's offbeat work that this claim becomes necessary.  Every fill and solo is unique, almost anti-guitar, in their sound.  'Bullet in the Head's solo begins with some echo-filled, mechanical sounding distortion.  The solo on 'Know Your Enemy' could have been produced by a malfunctioning tape machine.  'Wake-Up' features a solo bathed in extreme echo and Frampton-style talk-boxing.  Even his more conventional solos are enormous.  'Settle for Nothing' offers up some some languid jazz lines.  'Freedom' is a fine example of how tasty his playing can be when it's not trying to overwhelm you.  And if you love Public Enemy-style sirens with your hip-hop, check out the variations Morello puts on that convention scattered throughout the album (most notably in his rhythm work on 'Fistful of Steel').  <br />Bassist Timmy C gets several moments to shine as well.  He slaps and pops the addictive intro to \\"Take the Power Back\\".  Then, a lazy, loping 4-note theme serves as the delicate opening to \\"Settle for Nothing\\", before the heavens cave in (\\"Death is on my side... Suicide!\\").  On \\"Bullet in the Head\\", he provides a 7-note riff that's funky and confrontational (4-notes... 7-notes... See what I mean about simple and intense?).<br />Drummer Brad Wilk combines the skin-pounding intensity of a Dave Grohl, with the Caucasian funkiness of the Chili Peppers Chad Smith, and the hardcore speed of Faith No More's Mike Bordin.  He is much more versatile than you'd think, sprightly riding the high-hat in one verse, crashing the cymbals in the next, and then shimmering through with a snare roll.  Wilk's work on this album, to this day, is my favourite to air-drum to.<br />Frontman Zack de la Rocha may be focused (obsessed?) with social and racial injustice, so much so that those without his same political bent may feel excluded.  But he's also aware enough of the power of a catchy rhyme to draw in those not in the choir, that he lays them out end to end through out the album (\\"Another funky radical bombtrack started as a sketch in my notebook / But now dope hooks make punks take another look\\" he raps on 'Bombtrack', essentially making this point for me).  Zack raps with such passion and verve, and he has such a talent for succinct sloganeering, that he becomes the perfect frontman for this band of agitproppers.  Witness his lyrics to 'Killing in the Name' (still my favourite track).  The song starts with a distorted, almost Wagnerian, guitar overture.  It settles into a quiet bass-guitar and cowbell section duet.  And then the riff comes in.  Finally, Zack begins to chant.  And chant.  And chant.  He doesn't attempt to tell a story here, but instead just spouts slogan after slogan (\\"Now you do what they told ya\\", \\"F--- you I won't do what you tell me\\", etc.), repeating each over and over.  It's the perfect song for a rowdy group of teenage boys to scream to.  Which I suppose explains its enduring popularity.<br />I've owned this album since 1992, when I was 17 years old.  That year, I saw the Rage boys live in concert twice, and could have gone back for more.  If a CD could show wear, like an old LP could, then I would have worn this one out by 1993.  It rarely left my stereo that first year.  Now, usually when one's love affair with an album burns so brightly at the outset, it's liable to fade quickly.  That's hasn't happened yet here.  I can still play this one all the way through, two or three times a day, for a solid week.  And it still makes me want to move, and yell, and scream, and think.  Now *that* is staying power.
B00005JKQZ|5.0|A movie made for and about grown-ups, thank God and Ron Howard. Where does creativity and genius come from and how does someone come up with a truly original idea? Could YOU do it? What is it like to live with mental illness? What is love really? The casting of the 2 lead actors is perfect, they even resemble the Nash's! (see pics in the book, o'uninformed reviewers below)  Russell Crowe = freaking amazing. Jennifer Connelly = wonderful. Mr. Howard = a smart man, he figured out a way to let us all experience what it is like to live with a mental illness. good work everyone. Read the book, 1998 National Book Critics Circle Awards winner in Biography.
B00005QIPH|5.0|Elevated to the status of rock gods, The Strokes have recently been hailed by music fans and critics alike as the saviors of rock.  Though I myself wouldn't go so far as to make that statement, The Strokes (along with a recent wave of stripped-down alt/punk bands including the white stripes, the hives, etc...) are certainly taking the music industry in the right direction. As an alternative to the overpolished, overproduced music out there (which is just about as fun as a root canal), their sound is a return to the raw, driving rhythms of the punk bands of yesteryear.  Despite the obvious influences, none of these new bands' music comes off as stale or recycled. <BR>         However, the bottom line is that IS THIS IT? is a purely fun cd that really rocks.  I can listen to it over and over without having to skip any tracks, a rarity among best-selling cd's today.  Overall, a great debut by a promising band.
B00005YW4H|5.0|Norah, where have you been all my life?  This is one smashing CD, and Norah knows how to use her voice to really get the most out of a song.  She defines power under control.  Well, maybe she doesn't define it, but she does it about as good as anyone I've ever heard.  Her voice blends so well with this genre, and her experience in creating a mood through tone is plain to see.<br />One thing I've noticed with this CD is that the tracks flow naturally by connecting to both the previous and the next.  It's like watching a larger story unfold, and reminds me of watching a well-written movie.  This is one you will be able to play from beginning to end without having to forward or skip.<br />There's an uncanny gentleness in the music and Norah really shows her stuff by not over-stuffing flashy breaks and pops into the songs.  She gives just the right amount and the right amount is perfect.<br />I can only hope Norah pancakes out another breaker just like this one.
B00003CXXP|1.0|This movie, quite simply, is a poor re-telling of Pinocchio, ruined by Spielburg's inability to leave things alone.  There's an obvious break in the story, where it goes from Kubrick to Spielburg, from jagged and interesting, to formulaic and cliche (it occurs once the boy is left in the woods by his mother).  Instead of something truly thought provoking, we're left with a visually stunning (except for the ending that was tacked on), yet utterly hollow film, one that anyone that's ever taken an introductory philosophy or film class could make.
B00005JKJA|2.0|First off, the DVD does not have chapters.  Took me a while to figure that out.  Second of all, I really just didn't get it.  This film is so obviously Lynchian, in all it's twists and memory erasing turns.  I suppose I didn't like it simply because I didn't get it, that may seem like a bad reason but it's true.  Some of the moments were worth seeing, the Silencio sequence, but most was just a bunch of hooey.  I felt as if I needed Cliffs notes to figure out what really went on.  The performances were quite good, and it looked really great, with great direction by Lynch, but in the end, I just didn't get it!
B00003CXZ4|5.0|amazing?<BR>so mind blowingly<BR>when the concept is<BR>not like this movie<BR>How can someone<br />( Don't get it? Read backwards ;) )
B000063DS1|5.0|. It just arrived and I am on track 5. Couldn't wait to comment. The sound quality is truly astounding. I have had the vinyl and cd versions of the original release. This.... is like a whole new experience. Stop reading this review and buy it, NOW. For me it is worth it simply for the version of &quot;Don't do it&quot; that the movie opens with but was left off the earlier release. I have been a big fan for 16 of my 34 years and feel as if I have been waiting for this version for all of those years. Now I'm just counting down to the DVD release.
0790738139|5.0|No matter what you are looking for in a movie chances are you'll find it LA Confidential.  Simply speaking, the story centres on three police officers that are attempting to fight corruption, no only the place they live, but in there own souls.  The film is funny, atmospheric, consistently surprising and has more heart in its sub-plots than other films have in their main story.<br />One of the best things about the film is that you can watch anyone of the main characters and be treated to a story in itself.  Personally speaking I enjoyed Russell Crowe's character, Budd White, the most.  Guy Pearce's calculated manipulator and Kevin Spacey's self styled showman are also compelling to watch.  The introduction of Rolo Tamasey was funny, innocent and clever.<br />Kim Basinger's Oscar winning is also worthy of note.  Her performance adds a sense of glamour to the film while also suggesting a real person underneath.  Her performance invokes memories of Lauren Bacall and other great film-noir actresses.  Though others will disagree I felt she deserved the Oscar.<br />If you want to see the best film-noir since Chinatown or just want to see a decent film with some friends chances are LA Confidential will deliver.
B000066C6Z|5.0|This is a funny, funny movie. I'm glad Paramount has taken the time to give the Zuckers' series of silly movies the love they truly deserve on DVD. Airplane! and The Naked Gun both have had running group commentary with the Zuckers and others involved with the respective productions, and Top Secret! looks to be no different.<br />This DVD will include deleted scenes which I hope will include the rare \\"apple grenade\\" gag in the castle dungeon with Dr. Flamont. And I eagerly await the Zuckers' technical explanations of some of the sight gags such as the falling NAZI who explodes like so much porcelain. Or my favorite being the, uhm... something-something Intruder. You'll know it when you see it.<br />Oh, and as for the Ford Pinto gag (\\"Ding... BOOM!\\"); don't worry, I got it.
B00005YU1O|5.0|Hats off to FOX for really putting together a great special edition of this excellent film! The film itself looks great and there's so much extra material here, it will take you a few days to get through it all(if you go without sleep). So far I've only listened to part of the first commentary(with Linklater, Wiley Wiggins and the animation/art director) and it's really interesting. I haven't listened to the second commentary with all the animators, but that sounds cool too. I checked out the animation tests(very neat) and a few other short bits, but there's just so much material! <BR>Richard Linklater continues to exhibit his specific and refreshing voice through cinema. This film really stays with you(and I can't say that about too many films these days) long after you've seen it. Very thought provoking and dazzling to watch. Well worth the price. <BR>PS-if you missed it-check out TAPE(the other film Linklater released last year-also good-and the dvd has commentary!).
B00005RFVL|4.0|I was skeptical when I first listened to this album.  It's fantastic.  The band is incredible and Robbie Williams puts a modern voice to classics.  Instead of a tacky mimic of the original songs, he sings them in his own style.  This is not an imitation of the original artists.  The duets are excellent and I think this album is a tribute to the songs, not a disappointment at all.  There is an exception, with &quot;It Was a Very Good Year&quot;.  I think it is the only song that sounds &quot;karaoke&quot; and Im not sure anyone can perform that song like Sinatra.  Had they alternated the verses (like on the Sinatra duets album) I think it would have been better.  I never liked the song Mr. Bojangles (not even on this album) but if you like it I don't believe you'll be disappointed with this rendition.  So if you come into this album with an open mind, I believe you'll be impressed.  Enjoy!
0066620996|5.0|If you are involved in any human endeavor where people work together to accomplish goals, this best-seller is worth your time.  Recall, Jim Collins co-authored a previous best-seller, Built to Last, on why some businesses lose and why some win big. This new 5-year study examines how good companies become great companies, but the findings easily apply to schools, churches, political groups, etc. The book examines old \\"success\\" clichés and reveals fresh insights on what constitutes resultful leadership. It explodes many popular management cult myths and gets to the human elements that  build a successful organization. <br />Some rather uncommon CEO characteristics of new-look leaders: They are self-effacing, reserved, even shy and possess a great deal of genuine humility; no big egos here. They don't try to manage change or motivate people. They are driven to produce sustained results. They are ready at any time to confront the brutal-truth facts of their organization with steadfast faith they will prevail<br />The companies picked for the spotlight have an interesting people culture. If you paid them a visit, you would be struck by the evidence of self-discipline, and the absence of an in-your-face bureaucracy.  Employees are picked because they are already self-disciplined; they were hired because those who hired them know  that if you hire people who are already self-disciplined, they don't need to be \\"managed.\\" Guided and taught, maybe, but not tightly managed. In such a company, there is plenty of arguing and<BR>debate in pursuit of the best answers, but after the disagreement, everybody gets behind the decision.<br />Winning companies create a climate where truth is heard. The people love what they do partly because they love the people they work with. They know you can't manufacture passion or motivate people to feel passionate; you can only discover what ignites passion.  Rule by bureaucracy goes away if you have the right people.<br />Other leadership tidbits:<BR> -A \\"stop doing the wrong things\\" list, is more important than a \\"to do\\" list.<BR>-The author found no links between executive compensation and the process <BR>of going from good to great. Compensation was used to get and keep the right people.<BR>-The good-to-great companies were able to identify every item of cost, income            <BR>           and investment with the single person responsible for that item.<BR>-Ten of the eleven CEOs  came from within their own organization.<BR>-When in doubt about a potential new hire, don't hire. Keep looking.<br />The findings and conclusions in this fine work indicate clearly the need to rethink how we go about organizing people to insure the success of any endeavor. Many old \\"leadership\\" clichés don't apply.
B000002INR|5.0|There is not a bad song on this album.  It's one the albums you can listen beginning to end.  High energy music that pumps you up.  It's a must have.
B00005YXZH|5.0|...  Wilco have managed to create a CD that is simultaneously the most challenging work they've ever done but also containing some of their best hopes for the mainstream success their former label felt the album could never achieve.  Tracks like \\"I Am Trying to Break Your Heart\\" and \\"Ashes of American Flags\\" are not likely to be squeezed in-between the Goo Goo Dolls and Dave Matthews even on the hippest of rock stations but I'll be damned if \\"Heavy Metal Drummer\\" or \\"Jesus, Etc.\\" couldn't find some airplay and/or VH1 exposure.  People who know this band from their previous work will find a lot to enjoy here and newcomers, perhaps drawn in by the press surrounding this release, will get a chance to hear what music sounds like when art comes first and commerce is just an afterthought.
6305971099|3.0|The unstoppable Michael Myers returns in this 4th sequel. Danielle Harris gives another good performance as Jamie Lee Curtis' terrified daughter. This one picks up where (part 3) ended. There is more plot, more blood but ... it's starting to get a bid tedious.
B000003TAW|4.0|This is a really good cd.  Weezer is a really good band.  Their music is on the mellow side so if you like stuff like that I recomend it.
0385505833|4.0|Well,Well,Well if it isn;t John Grisham doing an excellent impersonation of John Irving and John Updike!!<br />Humorous,witty and fun to booth and there isn't a Mississippi courthouse in sight!<br />Only trouble is that it's very short by grisham's standards and only good for 2 hours on the beach.<br />Still well worth a buy.
B000005IS1|5.0|You're grumpy, tired, fed up, etc.  You need music to maintain.  The MC5 will clear all that bad s--t from your brain and replace it with with one big party.  Play LOUD for maximum effect.  You will most definitely feel better.
B0000640VO|5.0|Amelie From Montmarte is a brilliant, charming film which is odd at sometimes. Amelie is a woman who after finding a toy left by a child in apartment goes on a quest to change people's life. The cinematography and acting in this film is amazing. Audrey Tautou deserved a Oscar Nomination for her performance in Amelie From Montmarte. This is a funny, charming, brilliant work of art which will definatly change your life.
6301486269|5.0|The Ramona videos have always been very consistent and enjoyable. That doesn't end with this episode. In \\"The Patient,\\" ramona is scared to go back to school after she gets sick in front of the whole class. But she feels better when she gets a bunch of get-well cards from her classmates, even that pesky \\"Yard Ape\\"!!!!! (if you've seen the videos, you'll know what I'm talking about, haha) Very touching episode--not much more to say except that this is a very good one. These are excellent videos to collect--you'll definitely want to see them because it's ideal entertainment for everyone in the family.
B000021YQV|5.0|This album is soooo good.  It is incredibly AWESOME!  Just listen to it acouple of times and you will be addicted.
6305127646|5.0|When I first saw this at the movie theater I thought it was a good movie but forgot about it. It wasn't until I rented the video that I fully appreciated it. I've seen it countless times. Gadgets, marvellous disguises, good actors and actresses, humor and a fascinating and impressive performance by Val Kilmer. You would have to watch a few dozen of Roger Moore's SAINT videos to be equally as impressed or at least to see as much. They pack a great deal into this movie.
0441003257|5.0|Wonderful book. I'd been a Gaiman fan for a long time when I found this gem. If you've ever wondered what happens Good and Evil talk shop in a pub, this is a book for you. Carries things off to absurdist conclusions and I can't recommend it enough, especially if you've enjoyed smart satires from Joseph Heller or Kurt Vonnegut.
B000006TRV|5.0|What does one say in way of introduction to what is perhaps one of the finest and most popular albums in rock music. From the time of its original release, this album has been acclaimed as the most outrageous and most penetrating of the concept works ever released. I remember living in London in the 1980s and seeing the movie version of this at the time it premiered, and being flabbergasted at the artful way in which the animators interpreted this mind-boggling take on Britain after World War Two.<br />It is a most amazing concept piece, and a study in the ways in which individuals feel crushed, isolated and left bereft of hope by the indifference, cruelty and intolerance of a modern industrial society. It is not so much a collection of individual songs as it is a thought piece that reverberates on a number levels of the artist's consciousness, examining his innermost thoughts, hopes fears and experiences. It takes place in a surrealistic landscape, one that evolves as quickly as the changes in perspective shift and flow. Buy the CD, listen to it endlessly, and then go rent the video and watch it. It is a most provocative entertainment, and a strange and emotional whirlwind ride through the orbits of an artist's innermost ruminations. Enjoy!
B000024D4R|5.0|Animals, while not Pink Floyd's best album, is definitely a phenomenal musical accomplishment. There are only 5 songs on the album (3 if you don't count the two part minute-long &quot;Pigs on the Wing&quot;), and therefore they are quite long, clocking in at about 17, 10, and 11 minutes. Regardless of this, they never seem to get boring or uninteresting. Each one can be identified by recurring musical and lyrical themes throughout it, but each is a weaving, changing musical composition that always goes to new interesting places. David Gilmour's beatiful guitar work cuts through the entire album, more so than in Floyd's other albums.<br /><BR>&quot;Pigs&quot; is the best song on the album. It is complex and intelligent, but it also rocks pretty hard (and isn't that what's really important?).<br /><BR>While &quot;Animals&quot; isn't quite as well done as some of Pink Floyd's other albums (namely Dark Side, Wish You Were Here, and The Wall), it is really one of the brighter musical points of the seventies.
B00005B36H|5.0|...I started off disliking Tool immediately.  Coming straight off from such bands as System of a Down and Deftones, I think in a rush for the next such band, I turned to Tool.  I did not get what I wanted.<br />But it turned out ok.  Starting off, I didn't like how you couldn't just listen to Tool nonchalantly.  I thought the songs were too long, and I couldn't understand the lyrics enough to care.<br />Only until recently, I read a snippit from Tool's song Parabola:<br />&quot;This body holding me reminds me of my own mortality.<BR>Embrace this moment. <BR>Remember. <BR>We are eternal.<BR>All this pain is an illusion.&quot;<br />Since I'm somewhat of a new Tool fan, other hardcore Tool fans are probably scoffing at my choice here.  But for some odd reason, this line had an effect on me.  I decided to look into the lyrics more thouroughly.  <br />Impressed, I decided to give the cd another try.  It became much more enjoyable when I gave it the time to listen to it.  How the lyrics are sung, in such a way as to disregard puncuation, yet flows so well.  I'm not going to preach about the inner depths of Tools music, or rant about how religious it is.  Others have already said this.  To me, Tool is just a great band to listen to when you have the time to sit and actually listen.  <br />There's not much more to it than that, I believe.
1573221562|4.0|Wow!<BR>What a story!<BR>The writing is excellent. I could feel the dampness of the Victorian prison. I could visualize the dank, thick, stone walls which housed the prisoners.<BR>Here's a story of spirits and psychic mediums.<BR>Margaret takes on the volunteer work of a Lady Visitor of the women's prison. She is quite obsessed with the place and takes her duties seriously.<BR>Margaret meets and is very intrgued by Selena Dawes, a woman in prison for fraud. Margaret has tender feelings in her heart for the unfair, brutal treatment of Selena and the other women imprisoned.<BR>This is a very good book telling a very different type of story.<BR>The ending of this story is a breath taking surprise!<BR>I recommend reading this book, but it is not a light read. It will make you think and it's a terrific book to discuss with others.<BR>This is an eye opener of a story.<BR>Outstanding writing!
B00005OAIE|4.0|I haven't been able to stop listening to John Mayer's Room For Squares! I saw him perform two different times and after hearing his music, I knew I had to have the album! It's true, he does sound much like Dave Mattews Band, but so what? If you like DMB, then you'll like John Mayer too. If you don't like DMB, you'll still like John Mayer. He uses a lot of  guitar through out the album, mixed with other great sounds, like a vibrophone, on his fourth track. It's a great album all around and I can't wait to hear more from him! If your a lover of good music, then you should definitly check this out.
B00005JKBC|1.0|This movie was a waste of time. I love Brad Pitt movies(I haven't seen 'The Mexican' yet though) and so far this is his worst. The entire plot is rediculous. Robert Redford always staying one step ahead of the other agents. NONSENSE! He always having to tell the story of 'Brad Pit's' character. They'd flash back 25-30 years and Both of them had the same hair style, sideburns and wrinkles on the face(Robert Redford) Too much time in the sun Robert-ever heard of sunscreen? Overall, this movie is ... and should be reported as so. I bought it first and lost bigtime. I highly recommend renting first. That's if you don't care to lose a couple of hours of your life. PS. I never had the closed captioning problem. ... Just thought I'd throw that in. Thanks
B00003CXBK|3.0|I bought this because I had heard so much about it, that it was the best selling movie ever in Japan, etc. etc. While it definitely was interesting, I was a bit disappointed. There are many beautiful scenes, and the plot is set out in a very promising way, but then the movie sort of loses direction and drags on way too long. Also I felt there was a lot of gratuitous violence (I mean stuff that was really not necessary to the plot, and that kind of grossed me out, even more than a &quot;live&quot; R rated movie)<BR>Anyway, it WAS worth seeing, I just felt it didn't live up to all the rave reviews I've read.
B00003CXWV|2.0|While the acting, directing, and general storytelling was solid, I thought the movie was little more than a heavy-handed morality play disguised as a self-indulgant biographical expos&Eacute;. Truth is, I just didn't find the characters interesting or sympathetic and the ending made me groan. They probably got funding from the US government to present the anti-drug moral lesson.
0385503954|5.0|Like other reviewers I was ambivalent about all the publicity that surrounded 'Atonement' before its release last year. Happily I was not disappointed and it lived up to its expectations. It relies on traditional literary techniques to evoke memory and the power of writing. It also raises issues of literary power and readership. The conflicts of love and war, shame and forgiveness are carried throughout the novel. It also questions issues of class and atonement. I found it incredibly moving and shocking in many parts...Highly Recommended
B00004VVNC|5.0|It'll pull your guts out and hand them to you, then leave you with a profound tragic melancholy. Brad Pitt and Anthony Hopkins are great, though it's certainly not Pitt's best performance, in my opinion.
0385335482|5.0|Yeah, maybe, but so what? This book is a treat. The protag does have a serious shopping problem but Kinsella makes it seem like fun.  I must say I recognized myself more than once in this book- I would only recommended it to those who get a major thrill from sales on cute clothes and strappy sandals.  Tired of hearing about how the world is going to hell in a handbasket? Bill collectors calling you day and night about your Marshall Field's account? Join Rebecca on a shopping spree and forget about you troubles for a while.
B00005QG9J|5.0|I have been a incubus fan for awhile now (just about 3 years).  Make Yourself was the Incubus cd i got (and the best), but Morning View is a great followup.  While Morning View is a little lighter than MY, it is still a great cd, and shows off the maturity of the band.  Anyone who thinks Incubus is &quot;selling out&quot; should open up their eyes, because incubus has always been about doing different things with music.  Incubus will always be a great band no matter what they do.  Oh a just a personal note: the best song on this cd is Under My Umbrella
B000005Z0G|5.0|First off, I want say that although Pac was considered just a \\"thug rapper\\" by many who don't really understand him, he truly was one of the most important figures of the late 20th century. He was the leader of the most popular music form of the last twenty years. This is my 2nd favorite Pac album after Me against the world. It's typical Pac: political, personal, & poetic. One of the greatest things about Pac is when you listen to his albums it's like you're reading his diary. You get to hear what frame of mind he's in at different points in his life. This album was about Pac expressing his shock and disappointment at his life in the spotlight(point tha finga, streetz r deathrow). He still tries to maintain a positive attitude(keep ya head up)and has some fun(I get around). But he realizes that fame isn't all he thought it would be(point tha finga, strugglin, representin 93) With (last wordz) he rips it up on the o.g. rap dream team. Pac reminds \\"you of the things you were made to forget.\\"(Holla if ya hear me) Overall one of the best albums of the 90's.
B00005JKL8|3.0|THE GOOD: Owen Wilson does a fine job as a wise-cracking, Navy navigator. The setting in Bosnia looks and feels right. The basic plot of a downed pilot trying to get to safety provides interest and intensity. THE BAD: The actual story of the chase is mindless. The blow-ups and shoot-em-ups feel like something on the Universal Studios tour. The climactic battle is ludicrous. THE UGLY: The dialog sounds like it was cut in pieces from other movies and comes across as a Saurday morning cartoon. I didn't think it was possible to make Gene Hackman look bad, but the director certainly tried.
0399230033|5.0|Good Night, Gorilla is an absolute must-have for every toddler's library.  The illustrations are beautiful and have plenty of intriguing detail to talk over with your little one.  The story is funny and charming. You and your child will fall in love with the precocious gorilla!

The FlyLady has a 'Down to Earth' writing style which makes this book so much fun to read--you can't wait to get started!  It is very motivating and uplifting!

6305633177|3.0|I am one of the biggest fans of Metallica, but this dvd has some of the [worst] video ever. It was basically recorded with a personal video camera from like 1980 or something. They put a lot of good old Metallica songs, but just [bad] footage. If you are one of those people who follow metallica through everything then get it, but if you are just one of those people who just started getting into them, dont waste your money.
B00005JKJA|1.0|I have David Lynch completely figured out. His whole intention in film-making is simply to throw every Freudian cliche, nightmarish symbol, and bizarre twist that he can dream up into a pot, thereby creating a confounding stew that even he doesn't understand, because there's nothing TO understand.<br />This product is then marketed to an ersatz intellectual audience who debate and decipher all sorts of meaning out of this stream-of-consciousness mess, while Lynch laughs at his audience...all the way to the bank.  Ludicrous, but true.<br />This is the most accurate, in-a-nutshell review of \\"Mulholland Drive\\" you may ever read.
B00005OM4N|2.0|This cd was somewhat of a dissapointment for me. I have always loved Britney's cds until now. The song I'm A Slave for you is a really fun song to listen to with but with all the strange panting and the little parts were she goes \\"I just want to have sex with you.\\" is a little out of hand. So it's hard to really know if the song is good or bad. The other songs on here are very well put together but the not very great songs out number the good. So I guess it all depends on your taste of music because some won't like it and others won't. But for me I could of done with out.
630516603X|5.0|I have the original. This is just mind blowing. A lot of the same as the original but a whole lot more. More dancers, dancing, new songs, a celtic chant. This is a must have!! I also seen them personally. GO IF YOU GET A CHANCE!!!!!!!
B00004SCX6|3.0|This is Britney's sophomore album, and I have to say it is impressive. It includes the catchy songs: \\"Oops!...\\" \\"Stronger\\" \\"Don't Go Knockin'...\\" \\"What U See...\\" \\"Can't Make You...\\" \\"...Satisfaction\\" \\"One Kiss...\\" and \\"Lucky\\". It also includes the ballads \\"Don't Let Me Be...\\" \\"Where Are You...\\" \\"When Your Eyes... \\" and \\"...Diary\\". I like \\"...Baby...\\" better, though, but you should buy it anyway!
0345350499|5.0|This is my favorite book of all time. I got it for my birthday a year ago, and haver read it many, many times since then. The cover of my copy is falling off.<BR>This book has completely changed my view of the Arthurian legend. Before this I had read T.H. White's The Sword In the Stone, which I also enjoyed, but this book expanded the legend so much, revealing a side of the story which is very rarely talked about. The imagery is lovely, and the story itself is fascinating. <BR>One note. In a catalouge a few months ago, I saw this book and the reccomended age was 11 up. This is not a book for 11 year olds. Mature 13 year olds at the youngest. Besides the fact that it is sexually explicit (not, however, in a pornographic way), the story itself is advanced.<BR>But overall, I wholeheartedly reccomend this book.
B00005QZWI|5.0|The highlight of this soundtrack is \\"Lament for Gandalf\\" which is part of the Lothlorien track.  Elizabeth Fraser captures all the epic sorrow of the elves in her amazing voice.  I fervently hope that her unique sound will be used in the following soundtracks of Two Towers and Return of the King.<BR>This entire CD is excellent, as so many other reviewers have shown!  I needed to add this one because I felt not enough attention was given to the stellar work of Ms. Fraser.  Enya has received most of the attention.  (I'm not critical of Enya, I love her stuff also!)<BR>My main disappointment with this soundtrack is that there is no lament for Boromir.  His death in the movie (and the book!) is so tragic and moving that I wish he had received \\"Gandalf treatment\\" as well.<BR>I can't wait for the release of \\"The Two Towers\\" soundtrack.  I hope that there will be some great \\"Uruk-Hai\\" stuff as well as more Elizabeth Fraser!!!
0553573403|5.0|\\"A Game of Thrones\\" is a book that makes you realize why you read fiction in the first place. This is not only what is probably the best fantasy novel that I've ever read but one of the greatest novels in fiction. This is the first book in \\"A Song of Ice and Fire\\" series, a projected six book epic fantasy. This awesome fantasy has absolutely no quests and the plot doesn't center around magic. If that's the case, why is it a fantasy novel? Aren't fantasy novels supposed to center around quests and magic? The answer for the latter is the that that was true until George R.R. Martin came around.<br /> George R.R. Martin is an author of many books, a lot which are unfortunately out of print. \\"A Game of Thrones\\" is, as said above, unlike any normal fantasy novel. It centers around politics and war these two components to this extoadinary novel make for tons and tons of suspense. The plot of his fantasy novel is awesome. The Seven Kingdoms of Westeros has many big houses, or families, and man are rivals against the Lannisters. After an opening of some strange events, the Lannisters are on the brink of war mainly with the Tullys and the Starks (probably the msot loved house). Across the sea Viserys Targaryen, a direct descendant from Aerys, who lost his throne to Robert Baratheon, has his sister Daenerys wed Khal Drogo so he can get an army and win back the throne for himself. Oh, and may I add that these events only take place in oh, the first 100- 150 pages!? Never have I read a novel that has made keep flipping and flipping pages non-stop.<br /> Martin's characters are so believable and you can relate to them so well. It is easy to love the wonderful characters and to loathe the bad ones. Martin has a tendency to make characters reveal the true side to themselves, which makes this novel even more riveting. My favorite character is Lord Eddard Stark's bastard son Jon Snow. I relate to Jon so much and relations with characters like these makes this novel seem very real.<br /> George R.R. Martin has a gift to write beautifully and to tell awesome stories. His writing skill will make you turn pages in addition to the plot. \\"A Game of Thrones\\" is a fantasy novel that is like no other. I centers on things that make this novl more enjoyable than the regular \\"sword and sorcery\\" type fantasy. I recommend this novel to a fantasy fan that is looking for a great new voice in the genre. This is absolutely recommeded.<br />Happy Reading!br /> George R.R.

B000056HRZ|5.0|There are not that many romantic movies that men love, but this is the great exception. The reasons are not difficult to find. 'Casablanca' is a gripping thriller that never lets the pace flag. Ingrid Bergman is a doll. Humphrey Bogart is a man's man in a way that someone more obviously handsome, like Clark Gable, could never be. <br />The film has class and style that is sadly missing nowadays. Bogart looks good. Bergman looks beautiful and elegant. Even Claude Raines looks dapper, with his cap tipped nonchantly to one side. The script is clever and sharp with umpteen memorable lines. Throw in Peter Lorre and Sidney Greenstreet, and you have the recipe for a perfect film. <br />In 'Casablanca' the protagonists live out their moral dilemmas before us with a conviction that is rare in the cinema. Bogart looks genuinely pained when Bergman walks in. When Bergman has to choose between Bogart and Paul Henreid, you really believe her heart is about to break in two. This is acting at its best. Even Henreid manages to look noble and heroic as a wartime resistance leader without looking insufferable. Couple that with a script that not only involves us emotionally in their tangled moral dilemmas, but also resolves these dilemmas beautifully, and you have a recipe for a classic movie. <br />The director Michael Curtiz deserves credit for skilfully bringing everything together. Frame by frame, this film's brilliance is a tribute to his professionalism.
0671799320|4.0|It too me forever to plough through lengthy work, but it is an excellent book that tells the interesting story of the evolution of the global oil industry.  From Colonel Drake and the early oil barons, to the series of nationalizations that put this resource back in the hands of its rightful owners, the book read very well.
B00000JG41|4.0|Listening to Mr. Bungle for the first time has proved to be a little challenging. For the casual listener, it will be material almost impossible to penetrate. But if truly prog music appeals to you, if you ever liked Frank Zappa or if you enjoy jumping from Ska to Middle Eastern to Speed Metal, etc., dig this album. It is filled with musical surprises at every step. Mr. Bungle, with &quot;California,&quot; their most recent production, have accomplished the equivalent to a musical melting pot.

630027120X|4.0|The Mission is a powerful movie with a powerful message about sin, redemption, and love. It probes deep into the evils of the Catholic Church in Spain and Portugal in teh mid 18th century. Robert De Niro brilliantly portrays Rodrigo Mendoza, a dynamic character who transforms his life to a murderer who trades slaves to a Jesuit priest who fights for those seemingly 'enslaved' natives - the Guaranese. Jeremy Irons ixquisitley plays the role of a truly Christ-like figure. Father Gabriel is the epitomy of compassion, lvove, and understanding. With an incredibly written screenplay by Robert Bolt (who also wrote A Man For All Seasons), the Mission is an incredible film which explores the depths and beauty of morality and life ont he path to Jesus Christ.
B000025802|3.0|I certainly am no expert so you might want to weigh the review based on that. Some of the symphonies especially 7 &amp; 8 were just not there. Played too fast there is no lushness or warmth that one expects in Dvorak's music, especially when compared to other recordings I have heard.
B000002UVX|5.0|This is Jimi Hendrix in a live performance of straight-ahead, no nonsense rock &amp; roll.  Ably backed up by sidemen Billy Cox on bass &amp; Buddy Miles on drums, the performances captured here are tight and solid.  Hendrix was at the top of his game, and this no frills outing was just him wailing on the Stratocaster like no one else, with two guys who could keep pace.  Essential for Hendrix fans, worth it to anyone who loves good r&amp;b rock &amp; roll with guts and inspiration behind it.

B00005PJ8I|5.0|Cast Away is the story of a man named Chuck Noland who becomes the sole survivor of a plane crash and becomes stranded alone on a desert island where he finds himself struggling to survive for four years.<br />Cast Away is a film that stands at the level of a masterpiece. There are literally no flaws in this film. The storyline, which depicts the dramatic and exciting story of a lone, stranded survivor's struggle to stay alive, runs smoothly along. The characters are well developed, the actors are talented and convincing in their roles and is a definite must-see. I guarantee you will not regret seeing this film!
0393312836|5.0|A wonderful book that was hard to put down since reading the first lines about Alex and his Droogs.  In a future where after the sun goes down the criminals rule.  And a future where the solution to the problem is actually worse then the problem it self.  Welcome to Dystopia!  This isn't Brave New World, Anthem or 1984.  People aren't safe from the teen gangs that roam the streets looking for some ultra-violence and the old in-and-out.  \\"A Clock work Orange\\" is about a future where it seems that there isn't any future.  The world is a cess pool and something has to be done to tame the problem.  Unfortunately, how far should people go to solve the problem?      Read and find out
B00003CXWV|4.0|The range of characters he portrays is both broad and diverse.  And with each one he brings sincerity and believability.  Here he portrays real life drug smuggler George Jung.  Jung is a pretty typical product of a middle class upbringing.  He dreams of California, girls, and the good life.  Unfortunately, like too many of todays youth, he's lazy but obviously very intelligent.  He seizes on multiple opportunities and builds the largest cocaine smuggling operation (for it's time) in the U.S.<br />But as ye sow so shall ye reap.<br />Life is grand, for a time, before it all starts to unravel.  And the fall is hard.  <br />And as great as all the performances were, the film was so predictable that it lost something in the process.  But we are certainly privy to see the ill effects of participation in the drug trade and of drug use in particular.  The good life may not necessarily be as good as it seems.  There's a cost for everything.  <br />But certainly enjoyable to watch if not necessarily a film warranting a purchase.
B000002UAU|5.0|This album is the reason \\"Best Album Of....\\" lists exists! A song cycle about childhood, death, greeting the world around you, a circus, spiritual enlightenment, the apocalypse and leaving home to find oneself, all wrapped up in vibrant, brilliant technicolor production, gorgeous melodies, Indian Music, Rock, touches of funk, chamber pop, carnival music, 30's ragtime and animal noises! The fact that it was recorded by the biggest band on the planet made it an instant hit. That it was all done to perfection (EVERYTHING here works!) and has endured for 35 years as the best album ever made is a testament to the power and enduring beauty this work and these men had on popular culture. Simply put; THE BEST ALBUM EVER MADE.
B00003CXTF|5.0|Pearl Harbor graphically depicts the full-scale attack of the Japanese against Pearl Harbor on that fateful and historic day, December 7, 1941. This motion picture makes history come alive in a way that is unforgettable, and also gives a lot of background. Personally, I would classify it as a historical thriller and would reccomend it to anyone age 13 and up. Blends action, adventure, and history, resulting in an unforgettable must-see motion picture.
B00003CX8Y|5.0|I'm one of the people who happen to think this was Disney at its best.  When I was young, this was one of my three favorite Disney films.  It was one of the first films I was introduced to, and, naturally, I am very excited about the Special Edition; I hope Disney releases the Special Editions for the other two that I like just as much; Aladdin and The Little Mermaid.  I considered them a trio of the same type of animation. . .or similar anyway.  I miss this type of quality animation from Disney, and it's awesome that they're releasing this, with tons of behind-the-scenes features.  A big hand to Walt Dinsey Pictures for this one.  Let's hope there are more like it to come. :-)
B00005JKED|4.0|When I read all of the bad reviews given to this film I just have to laugh.  The society at large (trust me) has no idea of what inner city realities really are.  So for those who are so uninformed and have no experience upon which to form a sound opinion they would do better just to remain silent.  <br />As much as i've marveled at Denzel's range I felt that this was BY FAR the best performance of his illustrious career.  He was utterly transformed.  I am more amazed that the Academy would give him the award for this obviously negative portrayal of a police officer.  <br />The film is filled with surprises.  And I would agree that the film starts out spectacularly.  The coffee shop scene really made me sit up and take notice.  That and the card game to me were the best scenes in the film.  However, some of it seemed a bit too improbable to be believed.  Nonetheless, the film was (overall) brutally honest and raw.  Throw in some great cameo appearances and pretty credible performances by those performers as well and you get a quality, if not perfect, film.<br />And please keep in mind that just as Ethan Hawke's character has to really wake up to the realities of the streets so does most of the viewing public.  It's not Disneyland out there.  Despite what you may think.  To me Hawke's performance really makes the film so honest.  His naivete and broad optimism really contrasts Denzels cynicism and double dealing.  <br />Just because the Denzel's portrayal is in a negative light doesn't mean that it's untrue.  <br />Well worth the price of admission.
6300185249|5.0|I agree this movie is great and should definitely be put on DVD, I don't know why it's not available on DVD, it can't be because the critics panned it and it wasn't a box office smash because there are lots of movies that were critically panned and weren't big box office hits that are available on DVD and when I think of some of the garbage that is available on DVD I just find it a little frustrating that this and some otther nice deserving movies aren't on DVD!
B00003CX9E|5.0|How does anyone know that Kane's last spoken word was &quot;Rosebud&quot;, because no one was in the room with him when he said it - he was alone; the nurse was outside with the door closed and only entered when she heard the sound of the glass ball smash on the floor....so, there you are - that's what ruined the greatest film of all time...
1558216847|4.0|The criticism of Rawicz' journey are many and raise questions that are both historical and geographical. It is a very unbelievable journey. And I can understand the disbelief, especially the passages on the Gobi Desert, and the mountain pass into India (I've covered similar mountainous terrain in Pakistan and can't imagine doing it without NorthFace.)<br />But what is most impressive about this work are the items that most gloss over: Rawicz' descriptions of the Soviet justice proceedings that are both comical and uncomfortable. His exposition of torture which is very detailed and very disturbing-- the Russians spent more money and time studying and devising methods of torture than any other state in modern history. These passages alone make this read extremely visceral, intimate, compelling and horrifying. And from a historical standpoint Rawicz' descriptions are highly accurate.<br />The other interesting kernel that I wish Rawicz devoted more time to was the presence of an American in his camp who accompanied him on the escape. The American is not developed very much, but what is provided--that he was an engineer invited to the USSR to supervise construction of the underground metro system-- I found very interesting as I had never run across this practice while studying Soviet history in college.<br />All in all a very good read. The tale end of the journey includes observations-- land of the abonimable snowmen-- that I find sensationalist and a poor editorial choice that indicts the veracity of the entire story.<br />However I feel that the book is still rewarding, it's pace surprisingly well done for a novice writer, and it's historical and cultural commentary are highly accurate. It should be a definite read for Russophiles, politico-history buffs, and would-be adventurers.<br />Thom.

If you know someone who does not like Elvis play them this and they will change their mind VERY quickly. My husband cannot quit playing this one! He likes The Girl Next Door Went Walkin. I think all of these songs are great so they are equal to me! If I could give it more stars I would. I promise this one will be the prize in your Elvis colletion.
157492589X|5.0|How many times have we all gone to see a movie adaptation of a book and exited the theater with the words, \\"it was all right, but the book was better,\\" on our lips?  Very few Hollywood writers and producers can ever make a movie script as good as a novel.  Not so with Lonesome Dove!  Never before in all my reading and viewing of fiction, have I laughed and cried so hard for a group of characters.  Although the screen play was not written by Larry mcMurtry, the author of the award-winning novel, the screen writer did a wonderful job in trimming down this epic novel into a movie script that captures the spirit of a beautifully crafted tale of friendship, adventure and love.  Everything from the music, to the cast, to the visuals make this a must-see for both fans of the book and for those who have never enjoyed westerns.  It is a tale of two ex Texas Rangers, Captain Augustus McCrae, (Robert Duvall)  and Captain Woodrow Call, (Tommy Lee Jones) who give up ranching in the town of Lonesome Dove, Texas, steal horses from a Mexican bandit and start out on a cattle drive for Montanna.  They take with them and encounter along the way, a vast assortment of characters who make the trip all the more enjoyable for the viewer.  Some notables among these are the renegade, Blue Duck, portrayed perfectly by Frederic Forrest, who brings this cruel villain to life straight from the pages.  Also, Clara Allen, palyed by Angellica Houston, who is the strong-willed old flame of Gus.  The two things that stand out the most for me in this movie are the wonderful musical score, composed by Basil Poledouris, and the depiction of the life-long friendship between Gus and Call.  Friendship has been the theme of countless stories, but seldom is it portrayed so vividly, without being overly sappy, as it is in a story.  I always come away from the movie feeling that friendships like that of Gus and Call are as easy to find today as a cattle drive.  Another outstanding quality of the book and movieis the feel of authenticity the writers and crew bring to it.  While certain aspects of the movie are a bit cliche, (Gus riding off to save the lady in distress), other aspects are very real, (the water moccasin episode and Jake's hanging).  These qualities, both real and fiction blended together, make Lonesome Dove a truly epic tale that can accurately be called an American classic.  Sometimes funny, sometimes heartbreaking and often unpredictable, it is a masterpiece that is worth watching at least once!
B000021YQV|3.0|This is not a bad cd but this is not a great cd too. There's so much melody, nice riffs, gently singing and stuff. There's not enough hard-hitting music. It's to paparoachesque! SOAD is next nu metal superstar. Sad but true. Buy the first cd, forget bout this.
B0000636UN|4.0|When I first listened to this album, I wanted to write about it here, but I felt I wasn't ready. That's because you have to listen to this CD several times before you get used to it. There's nothing wrong about this process and the more you listen &quot;C'mom C'mom&quot;, the more you'll enjoy it.<br />&quot;Soak up the sun&quot; is pop, and old fans will not recognize sheryl. It's a sunny, happy and clueless song, just for the fun of doing it. The chorus catches you and I'm sure everyone is singing &quot;I'm gonna soak up the sun/I'm gonna tell everyone to lighten up&quot;. &quot;You're an original&quot; is a great track, with the participation of lenny kravitz. &quot;Safe and sound&quot; is a very powerful ballad and one of my favorites. The vocals are great and the lyrics are beautiful. It seems like an 007 theme song, doesn't it?  &quot;C'mom C'mom&quot; is a folk song, and I love the chorus. &quot;It's so easy&quot; is a good track and I also like the lyrics and the duet. &quot;Lucky kid&quot; is pure fun. It's like sheryl crow meets punk. The chorus reminds me of garbage songs &quot;you're wasted...&quot;. &quot;Diamond Road&quot; is also good and it would be perfect for a soundtrack. It seems like a love tale and has a positive message. &quot;It's only love&quot; is interesting but I still can't notice gwyneth paltrow guest vocals. Why sheryl did not give her a bigger part on the song? Gwyneth did a good job on &quot;Duets&quot; soundtrack and really deserved some recognition.&quot;Abilene&quot; is the typical song sheryl likes to perform. It's rock with good lyrics. &quot;Weather channel&quot; is another one of my favorites. Sheryl and a guitar, that's all you need to have a great track. In my country, the CD comes with a bonus track called &quot;missing&quot;. It's as good as the others, and I do not know why it was left off US version.<br />I highly recommend this CD.
0792837614|5.0|We all remember from our high school Shakespeare lessons that The Bard's work was divided into two categories--comedy and tragedy. The closest the stage has ever come to dealing with tragedy is certain operas. But when it comes to Broadway, everything's comedy except this one. Gotta keep it light, right? The noir stuff's for the artsy-fartsy types, don'tcha know? The fact that it made it to the screen is a testament to the fact that the first time &#34;musical tragedy&#34; was ever done, it was done right. And it opened the doors for other &#34;serious&#34; musicals like Webber's &#34;Evita&#34;. After all, wasn't the Broadway musical America's answer to opera? All of Bernstein's superb sound made the trip intact--Gershwin: The Next Generation. The hypnotic 12/8 Latin rhythms of the sardonic &#34;America&#34;. The...well, cool jazz sound...of &#34;Cool&#34; (even though that number appears here after Riff's death in the gang rumble, instead of sung by Riff as a pep talk before the dance at the gym the way it appeared in the stage production). The grief-stricken duet of &#34;A Boy Like That/ I Have a Love&#34;. The social commentary of &#34;Gee Officer Krupke&#34;, a &#34;distant early warning&#34; of the effect the social work/ psychotherapeutic approach to criminal justice was later to have on the whole apparatus of law and order. One thing I find ironic, though--the way the social mores of the mid-20th century dictated a change in the lyrics of Anita's section of &#34;Quintet&#34;. The stage version had this couplet; &#34;He'll come in hot and tired, so what? Don't matter if he's tired, as long as he's hot&#34; absolutely haa-aa-ad to be redone: &#34;He'll come in hot and tired, poor dear. Don't matter if he's tired, as long as he's here&#34;. Not to mention Schrank's threat to &#34;beat the crud&#34; out of the Jets. In the stage version, the original threat was &#34;beat the crap&#34;. Otherwise this flick might have copped an R rating. Or did they have those in the early-1960s--I forget. Anyway, the year this film hit the Oscars, it copped just about everything. But most of all, it even had influence on other entertainment--a year or so later, the short-lived &#34;Danny Kaye Show&#34; variety series had a sketch called &#34;Horse Hide Story&#34;. This sketch choreographed hitting and fielding activity in the manner of this film's &#34;Prologue&#34; scene, to the tune of &#34;Take Me Out To the Ballgame&#34;, that number played like it would sound if Bernstein had written it. At one point, a runner is called out at the plate by the umpire, who lifts his mask--it's Kaye. So the runner's teammates shout; &#34;Kill the umpire!&#34;, and that bench clears as they advance on Kaye, finger-snapping in rhythm, one pulling a switchblade on him. Although only viewers of Kaye's series saw this sketch, it was more of a statement of this film's audience appeal than its Oscars sweep ever was. Nowadays there would probably have been a Mitsubishi commercial with the Jets and Sharks dancing around a Montero.

The ending was so unbelievably far fetched it made my skin crawl. What would they have done if the guy decided to throw himself of the other side of the building, or blow his brains out, or even thrown himself in front of a bus???<BR>...PA - LEASE!!!

B00003CXPJ|4.0|&quot;Zoolander&quot; is one of those screw-ball comedies that comes out every once in a while. I didn't hate the movie, but I'm definitely not head-over-heels for it.<BR>The cameos in the movie are superb and I was suprised to see people like, David Bowie, Donatella Versace, and David Duchovny as a former &quot;hand model.&quot; It really does have its funny parts, and mocks hilariously at models and the fashion world. <BR>The plot is stupid, but you just have to sit back and laugh at the performances. Ben Stiller is always hilarious, and his father, Jerry Stiller, is even funnier as the manager of &quot;Balls Models&quot;. Will Ferrell of &quot;Saturday Night Live&quot; is a riot. He plays a designer named Mugatu, who brain-washes Zoolander. <BR>If you like comedies, I would at least rent it.  <BR>Overall, I don't think its a memorable movie, but it is definitely entertaining.
B00005RIKD|5.0|One constant of pop/ rock has been the complaint that the \\"new stuff\\" is overproduced in the studio and as such can't be played live with any great authority. But then again, that complaint has been used for decades in rock'n'roll-I call it \\"The Seger Syndrome\\" after the man whose greatest hit ever was a general boo-hoo on that issue. For the most part, that's always been a cover story for the feeling by certain rock fans who resent artists who've long since moved out of the garage and have outgrown their anger at the whole world. So let that bunch listen to their Sex Pistols and Dead Kennedy LPs. Contrast that with a guy like Sting throwing together a show at his house in Italy and still capturing as much essence as the songs he plays had in their original form. Even the songs with different arrangements are more enhanced than they are cases of throwing the baby out with the bathwater. Nope-Signore Sumner and company didn't \\"overproduce\\" a thing-they just cooked along and had as good a time as possible, trying to help themselves and their guests rebound from the news from New York of the cataclysm and atrocity earlier that same early September day.\\"Roxanne\\" gets a bluesy treatment to counteract its buckra reggae original. \\"All This Time\\" paradoxically gets a lighter touch but just as quick a tempo. Songs like \\"Fragile\\", \\"Set Them Free\\" and the jazzy \\"Dienda\\" are played virtually unchanged. \\"Brand New Day\\" is done more retro and semi-acoustic-maybe the way Louis Jordan might have done it. Not as electric but with every bit as much energy. I've always felt that \\"Fields Of Gold\\" could be done to the tune of Dylan's \\"My Back Pages\\", and vice-versa. \\"Moon Over Bourbon Street\\" gets a modern jazz handling as a departure from its traditional version on \\"Blue Turtles\\". \\"Every Breath You Take\\" is done more smoothly than on \\"Synchronicity\\". And there's yet a third version of \\"Don't Stand So Close To Me\\" after it had already been updated to a style consistent with \\"Synchronicity\\" from the skipping, nervous pace in the original. This one's softer, more introspective. Most live albums are nosh-pit stadium events-this effort is a lot more intimate and the better for it.ty\\" from the skipping, nervous pace in the original.

B000059HAI|5.0|Unfortunately, many people look to the 2001 release of &quot;Pearl Harbor&quot; to see what happened at Pearl. With &quot;Pearl Harbor&quot; you're getting an over-stuffed and over-rated film about a love story - and - oh, yeah - some Pacific Fleet getting blown up by the Japanese. It is a disgrace to even be in comparison with Mausda and Fleischer's &quot;Tora! Tora! Tora!&quot;. Everything but the special effects are better in this 1970 film than the other one release thirty years later.<br />&quot;Tora!&quot; documents and commemorates the coming time before the attack, giving you very respected points of view from both the Japanese and American views. It's here that you can see just how smart the Japanese were in a painstaking attack of Pearl. You can also see the subtle buildup and how really unprepared we were for such an attack. Such things as why the fighters were lined up and the radar crew were put down by HQ are told in the film, as well as an extrodinary battle scene suprising for the time and technology they had in 1970.<br />&quot;Tora!&quot; lacks a central character. If the film had one, perhaps it would recieve more Academy Awards. (Remember, &quot;Patton&quot; was also released the same year and shut out &quot;Tora!&quot;). Still, a strong performance by So Yamamura as Admiral Yamamoto strengthens the film, and easy and historic sequence makes the film flow and become one of the best war films ever made.
B0000640SA|5.0|I first saw Memento on Video and thought this movie rocks. Its original and thats what makes a good movie, the way its told backwards is good. It makes you confused but then the ending makes it clear, with a twist. What more could you want. <br />The original DVD is pretty lame and i thought it could of had more in it. I thought Memento would have more extras then this!, now the limited edition is coming out, i cant wait to get it. You haven't seen the movie before, SEE IT NOW. if you seen it and want it on DVD then wait for this to come out, don't buy the other DVD, the other one hasn't got anything on it anyway.
B000002NJS|5.0|This is definitely the most personal album Madonna has released since 1989's &quot;Like A Prayer&quot;. She talks about some very personal things in an almost surreal manner. The album, to me is very dream-like with its techno driven melodies and beautiful lyrics.<BR>You get a feeling that Madonna is in a sense of peace through the album. She is really in-tune with her feelings, and expresses herself perfectly. <BR>This a superb album and a essential for any Madonna fan.
B00004XQP4|5.0|Yes, Warning is a departure for Green Day. But is that such a bad thing? One of the most ridiculous and pointless desires some music fans have is for their favorite band to stick to a specific formula and to keep churning out the same album again and again and again. It's called monotony, and if Green Day kept remaking Dookie, the album that made them household names, it would get quite boring and pointless after a while. Thankfully, Green Day has the balls to experiment, and they seem to go more in the direction of The Clash. Not that Green Day is as good as The Clash (then again, how many bands are?), but Warning brings to mind what the Clash did when they made London Calling. Their self-titled was straight-ahead punk, but London Calling incorporated numerous musical genres and produced some of the greatest rock and pop songs ever recorded. It was a departure for the band that worked brilliantly. For Warning, Green Day slows down the tempos and works with crafting well-written, melodic rock songs. Gone are the three-chord romps of Dookie. The songs on Warning allow the trio to focus on their songwriting and skills as musicians. If Warning doesn't prove that Green Day are talented, I don't know what will. The title track, \\"Church On Sunday,\\" and \\"Hold On\\" are all great, catchy pop/rock tunes; and my personal favorites \\"Blood, Sex, And Booze,\\" \\"Minority,\\" and \\"Waiting\\" prove Green Day are not just a great punk band, but a great band in general. Cynics can whine all they want about Warning being a \\"sell-out\\" album, and Green Day not being \\"punk rock\\" anymore. But you know what? Green Day probably doesn't care, and I sure don't. I wouldn't classify a well-written, original, intelligent album like this as being an example of a band \\"selling out.\\" Warning is a nice change of pace for Green Day and remains one of their strongest records to date.
B000002UR7|2.0|Although this is one of my five favorite bands, I have to admit, this isn't a very good album. However, it shows that a band could make a more coherent direction. The Drill EP was awful, but this is like gold compared to it. However, it's no Bends, OK Computer, or Kid A. That doesn't mean that the album has nothing to offer. <br />For instance, \\"Anyone Can Play Guitar\\" is the album's best song. It's a punk-influenced, faster-paced tune you can get into.<BR>\\"Creep\\" is a good song even though I feel that it started post-grunge. But if \\"You\\" were to be released, I'd say the same thing.<br />The lyrics on Pablo Honey aren't bad, either. It's quite encouraging in fact. Well, one may find a song about [masturbation] (\\"Thinking about You) offensive, but I don't mind.<br />The album seems to have potential but not really get its quality. However, when I said post-grunge, I wasn't talking about stuff like Creed or Godsmack, more the post-Nirvana stuff, even though they were still existant at the time. It's grunge, but for this band, their style is better when it's not grunge. However, the first two songs and \\"Anyone Can Play Guitar\\" are the standouts, but the other songs are between average and unbearable. It's just that they sound the same to me. \\"Ripcord\\" wasn't really bad, either. It's also a more anthemic song on the album.<br />If you're trying to collect every Radiohead album, maybe buy this, but if you aren't already a fan, don't bother.
0786867973|5.0|Being a single man in the throes of mid-life ( I'm currently 46 ) many friends of mine have long suspected that, if asked, I could not say with any certainty where the kitchen is located in my flat. Obviously that is there not so gentle way of informing me that I truly do need to, from time to time, make myself much better acquainted with that long neglected area. A room where I feel completely ill at ease and one in which feels as if I'm entering a dark, forboding dimension. And, unfortunately, one in which I am ill equipped at best. With that in mind I recently purchased a copy of \\" How To Be A Domestic Goddess: Baking and the Art of Comfort Cooking \\" in a sort of desperate plea to save myself from the clutches of fast food chains and frozen dinner entree's that is the closest thing that I, sadly admitting, have to 'home cooking'....other than being entertained at various friends homes and having them take pity on me by cooking an actually fully realized meal. For which I am extremely grateful! <br />With all that being said, Nigella Lawson's book has been, save for one or two minor 'accidents' that I've committed, an absolute 'Godsend' in helping me and my complete lack of baking talents. The recipes are done in painstaking detail and the photo's show the finished product in all it's glory. And while I will freely admit that the end result of my cooking doesn't always mirror the photograph's in her book at least it allows me something to strive toward.  <br />Nigella's prose is extremely chatty and very intimate in a comfortable, getting-to-know-you sort of way. Unlike some recent cook books I 've come across she has a wonderful way of putting the reader at ease when attempting something new i.e. breads, cakes, cookies and even jams ( which I may never muster up the courage to attempt! ). And while my none of my creations have come out looking quite as extroadinary as her's I suspect half the fun is in the trying! Ummm.....at least I do hope so! Obviously for the'culinary challenged' male, such as myself, a book such as this is not only an education but an entertaining way of getting more comfortable in an area where we once found ourselves 'visiting' if only for that morning cup of coffee!  Plus, of course, now instead of just entertaining friends with a wonderful cup of java I may have a wonderfully delicious surprise the next time someone comes over. And if that isn't comfort than I don't know what is. Thanks!
0066211697|4.0|This tells the story of one girls summer as she &quot;comes of age&quot; The book feels up to date in many ways. The girl's widowed father prefering to &quot;be a pal&quot; to her as opposed to real parenting, which would involve dicpline and punishment is very much what one encounters in many thiry something (with kids) households today. The images of nature and moods are poeticly portrayed without the narative losing any of its tension. This book also avoids all the cliche usualy associated with this theme. There is none of the self importance of an anais nin story and none of the airport romance novel scenary sometimes encountered in a collette story. You don't have to be into French literature to appreciate and enjoy this and its avery quick read.
B00005JKJA|5.0|A great film, and one meant to be viewed in its entirety. To the fuming reviewer below, David Lynch himself stipulated that there be no chapter stops on the disc, and for a film of this type I can understand why. Who on earth uses search by scene features much anyway? If watching in a couple of sittings (a BAD idea for Mullholland drive), just hit play and you'll start from where you left off anyway. If you're desperate to find that certain scene hit the 30x search. Sheesh.<br />Again, this is a film meant to be WATCHED, without distraction and without fast-forwarding, rewinding etc. (like being at the cinema, geddit?).<br />Great stuff.
B000002KDG|5.0|Neil Young's Rust Never Sleeps is an archetypal rock album that is simply essential. Split into acoustic and electric sections with the excellent classic songs My My, Hey Hey (Into The Blue) and Hey Hey, My My (Into The Black) serving as bookends, it incorporates all of the elements that make Neil Young great into a single, immediate, excellent album. It has been noted that this excellent effort - with its electric/acoustic format - was based upon the groundwork laid down by Bob Dylan on Bringing It All Back Home; and this is true, though the acoustic and electric sides are swapped here. Starting off the album with its absolutely memorable acoustic riff, My My, Hey Hey is a nearly perfect song that has become a Neil Young anthem. The next song is Thrasher, which is one of Neil's best songs in my opinion, and quite underrated - a very personal song about his artistic integrity, this album features one of his most beautiful vocals, and some of his best lyrics. Other acoustic winners include Pocahontas, another perennial Young classic, with its wild lyrics and imagery. Sail Away is a similary beautiful folk song. Things start to heat up with the excellent Powderfinger, a truly astonishing song packing quite a lyrical punch. It's quite an unspoken and political statement such as Neil has not often made since - as are the next two song: Welfare Mothers (with its obvious title), and Sedan Delivery (a song about the drug trade.) All three are excellent. The album closes out with a reprise of the first song, this time in electric form. A slightly lyrically-altered cousin to its acoustic guise, this raw and in-your-face version lacks the polish and precision of the acoustic version, but has a charm all its own. It closes out with one of the electric hard rock jams that make Neil's live shows so great. This is a great album - one of Neil's finest - as it enscapulates all that is great about him - gentle, rolling acoustic songs, imaginative lyrics and stern lyrical statements,hard rocking proto-punk/grunge rockers - and puts them all onto this one great canvas. Musically, it's great; and, lyrically, this is where Neil really started to blossom as one of the finest and most unique voices in rock. Simply put, an essential album all around.

A<br />2) soak up the sun-  very quiet, so you'll have to raise the volume a lot.  but you're raising it for a good thing. A+<br />3) you're an original-  totally not original, but very fun. A<br />4) safe and sound-  sheryl, go back to the first three tracks and see how bad this is. B-<br />5) c'mon, c'mon-  too long. A-<br />6) it's so easy-  what's so easy is to skip this track. B<br />7) over you-  extremely weak, endlessly long, and that's it. B<br />8) lucky kid-  cool summer beats, and it flows into <br />9) diamond road-  nice change from lucky kid, but still great. both- A+<br />10) it's only love-  good sounds, it sounds like every other song on here in the beginning, but it gets excellent. A+<br />11) abilene-  boring. B+<br />12) hole in my pocket-  very annoying, it's way too long. A-<br />13) weather channel-  a break from the verse-chorus-verse is needed, and it's great.

B00005A46T|5.0|I am sick of hearing mixed reviews for this album. I have been listening to heavy music for about 15 years now and I actually love this album. The reason I have so much respect for this band is because they actually got A LOT HEAVIER after their debut album came out that everyboday and their mom owns. This album is very brutal and has the qualities of straight death/grindcore metal at times. Yes, I think bands like Cannibal Corpse, Suffocation, etc. have the style locked...but Slipknot actually took me by surprise on this album and for some reason I cant get this one out of my cd player. I reccommend this cd to somebody that is not looking for sugar coated radio metal music. Iowa gets an A in my book and I could give a hell what anybody else rates it. I hope they keep it heavy...

B00005QG9J|5.0|Why is it that we dismiss some CDs too early and then later regret that we did?  This is just the case with &quot;Morning View&quot; from Incubus.  When the album first came out and &quot;Wish You Were Here&quot; was released and I was't really into it then.  However, now I am finding myself going back to this album that I abandoned, way too soon.  And I have one song to thank for that.  &quot;Nice To Know You&quot;, the first track on the album and the second song released.  This song is a pleasure to listen to, it's one of those songs(much like &quot;Drive&quot; from Incubus), that is so easy to like.  &quot;Nice To Know You&quot; is possibly one of the best rock songs I have heard in a long time.  And now comes an equally good song &quot;Warning&quot;, the third release and the eighth track on the CD, a song I am already liking.  I think that Incubus in a very underrated band, much like Collective Soul and maybe that is why I like them.  Isn't it funny how one song or a couple of songs can turn the liking or disliking of an album around, and thanks to &quot;Nice To Know You&quot; and &quot;Warning&quot;, I find myself liking &quot;Morning View&quot; even more.  So to all music lovers out there, never give up on an album, I almost did and I now know better.  Album grade B+.

B00005JXY3|2.0|After having fallen in love with the original Karate Kid movie, I was definitely disappointed by this one...the acting is terrible and there are too many holes in the plot. Also Elizabeth Shue did not return as Alli, which is quickly explained at the beginning as her having &quot;Fallen in love with some football player...&quot; and wrecking Danny's car. So much for true love. You also never see his mother at all and it's obvious they were trying to cover for that.<br />The whole thing is about Danny and Mr. Miyagi going to Okinawa to find Miyagi's childhood sweetheart and battle his enemy who were both conveniently not mentioned in the previous movie. Danny also gets a new girlfriend, which again wrecks the whole idea of the first movie that he and Alli were in love. If you want my advice, don't bother seeing this movie. It kind of ruined the original for me, don't let it do so for you. The only thing I will give it credit for is the final fight scene.<br />If you have to see KK2, think of it as a separate movie, not a continuation of the first one.
0803723865|5.0|We found this book when we were holidaying in Spain at our friend's house...and read it to all 4 of our kids (ages 8, 6, 3 and 1) every night.  It's an amusing story about a mouse who tricks his way out of being eaten, over and over again.  The dialogue is lovely and provides scope for lots of interesting voices.  The ONLY dissapointing thing was that the book ordered in the US is actually different in places from the original UK version (which was so wonderfully British)...we just crossed those bits out and put in the origianl words.  Our kids now call apple crumble \\"gruffalo crumble\\" and I can see this book becoming a family favourite.
0790743221|5.0|Katharine Hepburn used this as her comeback vehicle first on the stage in 1939, then on the screen. Supported by Grant (their 4th and final pairing) and Stewart, &quot;The Philadelphia Story&quot; is a funny piece brought to life by its three vibrant stars. The screen version is more coherent, and satisfying than the play, and Hepburn plays well with Grant and Stewart. The chemistry between Grant and Hepburn has a familiar feeling to it, that at times seems to leave Stewart as odd man out. This only adds to the complexities of this love triangle between Tracey Lord, her ex C.K. Dexter Haven (Grant), and the young brash reporter (Stewart). Don't just watch this gem once. It's heavy on dialogue, and short on action. I have watched this many times, and I still discover new aspects of the piece. Twice would do for anyone not as fanatic as me. A great vehicle for Hepburn, and a fun movie for Hepburn fans!
B000063DS1|5.0|Wow. Just took this out of the box and re-realized how good The Band were. I've got most of their recordings (pre break up), but this is something on another level. The sound of this new box is outstanding and although I have not compared one to one with the older 2CD version I suspect I won't be playing it much any more. I'm too young to have seen The Band and regret it more than every now, but all I can say is if you like great music of any sort from any era you gotta have this. Roll on the DVD.
0736041850|5.0|While browsing my local bookstore for exercise and nutrition books, I stumbled across this masterpiece. The author (and illustrator) is genius at conveying information. If you want to simply and quickly understand what your muscles are doing when weightlifiting, buy, borrow or steal this book immediately. No regrets.
B00005YXZH|4.0|I have to admit that after most listens to the mp3 version of YHF, I wasn't impressed. But this release grows on you much the way the band has grown on it's previous work. And the sound is considerably better a the label-issued cd. Early-day Wilco fans may not recognize this band, although I believe if you take their first three solo releases and play them back to back to back, you'll see YFT was the logical next step. It's not the alt-country so many (including myself) were looking for, but it deserves the rave reviews you've read. This is an amazing cd that cannot be tagged as pop or alternative or anything really. I stands on its own. &quot;Heavy Metal Drummer&quot; and &quot;I'm the Man Who Loves You&quot; are gems in the middle of the disc -- you'll pull out the liner notes so you can sing along with the lyrics. Other songs get better with each listen. Be warned, however ... overall, YHF is probably not catchy the first time you year it. I suspect it gets better with age. One complaint: There's a little too much going on at the end of most songs. They're ... well, bussy with bells and feedback and eletronic gunk. The song-writing, however, is beyond stellar. I wonder what's next?
0783225733|5.0|This is an incredible movie. I recommend the DVD as it has a nice section on the making of the movie (with Ron Howard) as well as an interview with Jame Lovell.<br />Of course the sound is fantastic with the DVD..........enjoy.
0446310786|5.0|In my house this book is held with more reverence than the bible. I have heard the plotline from my mom at least a million times but i have never had the determination and the will to read it until now. This book is every bit as well written and classic as everyone I talk to believes it to be. Its masterful use of a child's perspective on the wrongs of our world is breathtaking. Read it... I did and I'm only 16...to think people say the youth of our nation has no appreciation for great literature.
0425173739|5.0|Like MURDER ON THE ORIENT EXPRESS and DEATH IN THE CLOUDS, Christie's DEATH ON THE NILE finds Poriot en route--this time on vacation in Egypt, where he encounters a romantic triangle that seems destined for lethal results.  Linnet Ridgeway has everything: beauty, brains, unspeakable wealth... and Jacquline de Bellefort's boyfriend, a handsome but simple man that Linnet stole away from her friend and married.  And now Jacquiline is in hot pursuit, unexpectedly appearing to embarrass the newlyweds at various points along their journey.  Linnet and her husband attempt to escape by secretly booking passage on a tourist ship traveling the Nile--but Jacquiline is one step ahead... and murder is not far behind.<br />This is Christie writing near the peak of her skills, offering us a complex tale of emotional fury, considerable atmosphere, and endless intrigue played out by a truly eccentric cast of characters that include society snobs, underhanded servants, neurotic writers, unsavory businessmen, a communist, and just possibly one or two jewel thieves for good measure.  Unlike the more famous ORIENT EXPRESS, which offers us a meticulous and extremely cool crime, DEATH ON THE NILE veers into considerable emotional melodrama--and although Christie walks a very fine line here, she succeeds in bringing it off with tremendous flair.  And when it comes, the solution to the crime is one of her most memorable and successful, combining the logic and startle-factor that have made Christie legendary in the genre.  A brilliant piece of work from start to finish.
B00005JKBC|1.0|DVD problem: unable to turn off hearing impaired captioning. I both rented this DVD and bought it but the hearing impaired text appeared on the screen on each copy. I really like the movie but hate the poor quality of the DVD disc. This appears to be a systemic problem with other viewers as well. Think twice before buying any UNIVERSAL DVD.
B000060P79|5.0|if you're looking for a great cd full of catchy songs, BUY THIS CD!!  this cd is full of great song, love songs, break up songs, and just fun songs.  these guys are awsome and you can catch them this summer as part of the vans warped tour.  [....]
0783226845|5.0|This movie is not that great but someone starring in it is unbelievable. Al Pacino brings acting to a new height and I don't think anyone can beat him in acting ever. If you haven't seen the movie you are missing an opportunity of a lifetime to see one of the greatest artists of our time at his best. Watch it and judge for yourself. The story is alright and depicts this Colonel (Pacino) who is blind and a kid who has issues however the intenese emotional drama is mind boggling. I always believe that great movies are those which evoke emotion in it's audience and this movie made me nostalgic. You must see this movie to understand how fortunate most of us are as we are still able to see.
B00003CXZ1|2.0|For everyone who has played the LARA CROFT role-playing games, this film does a great job of capturing the timbre of the game.  From her mansion where she trains to faraway exotic locales that she visits, there were several points in the movie that vividly re-created aspects of the game.<br />For those who have not played the game, you may ask:  &quot;Who IS Lara Croft?&quot;  Well, she is a cross between an acrobat / weapons expert / martial arts guru &amp; Indiana Jones - all rolled up into one.  Like Indy, she is always in search of lost treasure &amp; artifacts.  When people and circumstances get in her way, the first 3 talents come into play.<br />As for casting, Angelina Jolie is PERFECT as Lara Croft.  She has everything the role calls for:  the athletic body, the exotic beauty, a sinister smirk, and the ability to move fluidly and gracefully like a ballet dancer.  Then, on top of all that, Jolie can actually act!  In fact, in my mind, she is one of the top actresses in Hollywood.<br />All that said, this movie just didn't &quot;work&quot; for me.  The fault was not in the direction or the action sequences (which were quite good).  Rather, I found the plot wanting.  It just seemed too off-the-wall and far fetched for my taste.  The objective was apparently to blend the adventure / fantasy genre with science fiction.  In my mind, it didn't succeed.<br />If you are a fan of the game, the film is worth seeing once - just for the experience.  It may also be worth seeing once if you're a fan of Indiana Jones type adventure movies.  Other than that, I would not recommend this movie.
B000065U1N|5.0|This film was absolutely excellent! I felt somewhat at an advantage watching it because I read the book in advance, but nothing was lost here. The book was incredibly well done, and only Ridley Scott could do this movie justice. The music combined with the filming aided this movie in giving the same feel the book had, which was that this was not a brilliant screenplay written for hollywood, this was REAL. Great acting throughout, editing, music. There is absolutely no reason that this film shouldn't have been the picture of the year. <br />Bravo Ridley Scott for more ground-breaking work!
0844230006|5.0|How to Get Ideas and other books on the subject of creative thinking are mainly just elaborations on the core thoughts laid down by James Webb Young. This is a classic read; short, pointed, and truthful. If you are in the business, you will find your hunches confirmed in simple, memorable language. The other books on the subject are very rah-rah; this book just tells it like it is. Not a self-help book, more like an instruction manual for your brain.
B00005OWEG|4.0|I believe the original film as a whole deserves 5 stars, but it is very hard for me to understand the importance of the added footage. Now, I am surely not one to critize Mr. Coppola; both he and his film are brillant. But, my question is, &quot;Do the added minutes really make the story much better?&quot;. The absurdity of the situation is already apparent, and the characters have been treated with due attention. After watching Apocalypse Now-Redux I once again came away from this film astonished, but no more then when I had first experienced it. Though, if you have never seen this film I compel you to do so as quickly as possible, no matter the version.
B000002IHU|5.0|This was the first CD I heard of Ratt, after I had heard the &quot;Point break&quot; soundtrack &quot;Nobody rides for free&quot;. If you like 1 track of the album, you will probably like the entire album. It is very energetic from the beginning till the end. It doesn't have a balad, but some tracks like &quot;Lay it down&quot; have lyrics that could attract a wider audience. The guitar riffs and Pearcy's voice are excellent. This is their best album in my opinion. &quot;Out of the cellar&quot;, which is often rated their best, has only a few good songs and the album is not as consistent. &quot;Dancing undercover&quot; would match the most with &quot;Invasion&quot;. If you like a different rock tune, then this is the one!
B00005YXZH|5.0|I am not one to mince words, this is by far the the best album of the year so far by an american artist.<br />In my humble opinion.<br />Well done, Wilco.
B000002JSJ|5.0|Led Zeppelin never made a bad album in their entire career. This album, \\"Presense,\\" is no exception. It is filled with the classic rock heaviness that Zeppelin mastered. There are no acoustics or sythasizers on this album, making it very heavy at some points. Specifically in the sprawling \\"Achilles Last Stand.\\" This song is easily the best song on the album; a mammoth 10:22 minute song that rivals even \\"Stairway to Heaven.\\" John Bonham's drums sound especially good on this song and this album, probably his best performance on any Zeppelin album. Jimmy Page, as usual, succumbs to his wonderful habbit of playing both the melody and the harmony at the same time. On \\"Achilles Last Stand\\" his spontaneous riffery can be heard echoed in later great artists; such as Judas Priest, Iron Maiden, Saxon, and a slew of others. The beat of the song is fast and furious, in a grandious manner, not unlike a fast, more intense Kashmir.<BR>     The other stand out track is \\"Nobodies Fault But Mine.\\" This song represents the creative side of Zep to the full, with its multiple harmonies and imaginative arrangement, coming together for a masterpiece of classic rock. Robert Plant's voice melds with Page's and Jones'guitars, making an interesting effect, similar to the \\"Houses of the Holy classic\\"\\"No Quarter.\\" The rest of the songs are all up to typical Zeppelin standards, with the heavily melodic \\"For Your Life,\\" the innovative, blusy \\"Royal Orleans,\\" the slick \\"Candy Store Rock,\\" and the crucnhing riff laden \\"Hots For Nowhere.\\" The last song, \\"Tea for one\\" is a bit of a puzzler. It sounds like the sequal to \\"Sense I've Been Loving You,\\" but doesn't have the same jazzy feeling or intensity. Page uses some interesting guitar techniques, and Plant's vocals slither in and out between riffs. Its a solid, slow, melodic track, good for closing the album. <BR>     So to call this album downfall of Led Zeppelin would be wrong. The only thing that could had ever stopped Zep would have been a catastrophy, which, sadly is what happened in the event of John Bonham's death. However this album stands strong, much stronger than most will admit. It is overshadowed by the greatness of \\"Physical Grafitti\\" and the somewhat glossy feel of it's sequal, \\"In Through the Out Door.\\" Yet this album certainly is worth it, if just for \\"Achilles Last Stand\\" and \\"Nobodies Fault But Mine.\\"
0971855110|5.0|I have been on the flylady list since 1999.  Even though i have never even fully done the program, my house is 1000% better.  So many things are just automatic now.  I never go to bed without the kitchen being clean, i always sort the mail over the trash as soon as it's brought in.  Even when my house gets messy, because i've done so many 27 flings (decluttering), it can be completely neat in under 30 minutes.The thing that's different about this book is it really stresses *decluttering*.  So many household organization books spend most of the time telling you how to store and arrange worthless junk that needs to be thrown out.  This book really gets the point across that you can not organize clutter!  The other thing i love about this system is that it tells you *exactly* what to do in very small, managable steps.  no all day projects required.  I was completely undiciplined before, now i more often than not take the *do it now* approach. There are also short, simple chapters on menu planning, vacations, and moving.  I love that she makes everything as simple as possible.  Lastly, this book does so much more than organize your home, it is really about getting your whole life together. When you care for yourself, your family, and your home and everything else will fall in place. I can honestly say that Marla is a wonderful, giving person who has helped so many and asks for nothing in return. I love her!!!
B00005R2M3|5.0|Shakira did a great job making this project. Ev'ry song is worth listening to. Underneathe Your Clothes reminds me of a song that Celine Dion would sing, but it is so great song still! This album is a mixup of Spanish and English, wonderful:-) I've heard Underneathe Your Clothes on the Radio and on the Computer and I heard Whenever, Wherever and said to myself I've got to get this album so I did today at the store. As of ALL of these songs are written by Shakira. Except for one is written by Gloria M. Estafon for the English Version!*! Shakira writes very great songs, I am glad she made this album. Cos it ROCKS!*! My favorite songs are Underneathe Your Clothes, Whenever Wherever, and the Spanish version of Whenever Wherever:-) This album ROCKS!*! So please buy this album today, and don't listen to what other people say. K? Bub-bye!!!
0316776963|4.0|After reading this novel, I now wonder what Sedaris has left to write about.  He has covered his family - through funny quips, anecdotes, and sidebars, throughout the rest of his novels, and continues on in this book.  Although it was the typical amusing/fast read of a Sedaris, I perhaps was looking for something new or more by this point in his career.  On the other hand, I couldn't rate it lower than 4 stars, being after all the amusing/fast read that I wanted/expected in the first place.
6305313687|5.0|One afternoon while there was nothing to do I decided to go and see this film. This may be one of the biggest surprises of my life. A very well acted and made movie it tackled large subjects without flinching and not avoiding. <BR>The movie stars Edward Norton as Derrick Vinvard. A former skinhead who has just been released from prison to find his brother Danny played by Edward Furlong is following in his footsteps. Beverly D'Angelo, Avery Brooks, Elliot Gould and Stacey Keach are all fantastic in the supporting roles but it's both Furlong and Norton ,mostly Norton, who really have the floor in this movie. <BR>The movie takes a good look at racisim, and hate and never losses it's focus. Norton is proving that he is the best young actor of this generation and he recieved a much deserved Oscar Nomination for this role. At time difficult to watch becouse of it's unflinching look into the world's of hate, prison and redemption.
B00005221M|5.0|Great Adventure movies have always been rare.  In recent times (last 15 years) they've become nearly extinct.  'Last of the Mohicans' stands out even more so in this desolate landscape.  This movie cannot be over-praised.  The total commitment by the director, actors and film crew is evident in every scene.  The writing is intelligent and thoughtful.  The acting, outstanding.  The action scenes are as hard-hitting and realistic as you'll ever see.  When Hawkeye (Daniel Day-Lewis) confronts an Indian warrior, both with tomahawks in their hands, the ensuing fight will leave you breathless because of its absolutely convincing realism.  Beautiful Madeline Stowe gave an Oscar-worthy performance, as does Daniel Day-Lewis.  It's a complete mystery to me why this movie didn't win best picture (it wasn't even nominated, Clint Eastwood's 'Unforgiven' won that year), and director Mann certainly should've been considered for the award that Eastwood won.  Anyway, not important, since Oscar rarely gets it right, but that's another story.  See this movie.  It merits repeated viewings, and I think you'll find it will become one of your favorites also.  Bye for now.
B00001OH1S|5.0|The entire soundtrack is full of intriguing music that not only makes the listener feel pretty mellow, but at the same time, very...well, enticing. And the movie certainly brings something to the music that /just/ listening can't do.
0345440900|1.0|I found this book to be an advertisement for convienent parenting. The concepts in the book are for the sole 'benefit' of the parents while suggesting that the babies are getting what they need, which, in Ms. Hogg's terms, translates into one word: independance. She does not advocate carrying your child, and Ms. Hogg suggests that breastfeeding a child for more than a year is for the emotional benefit of the mother and not the child. Though she mentions that parents should listen to their own intuition, she clearly doesn't mean it. Not a book for those who wish to encourage security and trust in their children so that they will naturally evolve into their independance in their own time, not in a self-proclaimed expert's time.
B00005JKDQ|5.0|Monsters Inc. is one of the funniest animated movies ever to be made. This movie brings together state of the art graphics, with a wonderful storyline and interesting characters. This movie takes place in a city of monsters. This city is just like real life New York, or a big city like that. But what throws in the twist is that the cities power runs on the fear of little children. Many monsters are on the job to scare kids and get the power to run their city. Sully (John Goodman) is one of the best scarers of all time! His helper Mike (Billy Crystal) wants to help Sully to be the top scarer. But there is one problem, if the monsters come in contact with the children, they are contaminated, so they have to get in and out without touching anything in the human world. But then something happens....a small human child gets loose in the the monster's city. And it is up to Mike and Sully to help this small girl escape before an evil monster set on becoming the top scarer can harm her. <br />This movie is full of humor and full of heart. All of the characters make this movie funny and exciting. This is a good movie for kids and kids at heart. The story is amazing. And even though their is monsters, they will not scare the kids. The small children will like this movie just as much as the adults. This movie is definately worth the money, and will be a welcomed addition to anyone's collection.
B00005JKQZ|5.0|A Beautiful Mind is simply THE BEST MOTION PICTURE EVER MADE! Russell Crowe is ingenious in his potrayal of John Nash, the brilliant scholar, on the border of genius, yet madness. Russell's actions, gestures, movements were incredibly real & life like. This movie takes you away, into the mind of a mentally ill person. Although the potrayal was of a real life schizophrenic genius, I am Bipolar (which is a fine line away from schizophrenia) & have suffered mental illness for the past 7 years, with a tortured brain & just like John Nash, have never been able to be \\"free\\" of mind. I related with this film on a very emotional & respectful level, all across the board! No one has EVER been able to capture the TRUE kaos of mental illness before on film! This film was truly unique, amazing, uplifting, it made you cry & director Ron Howard has made sure that this film takes you away on a journey with all of the characters, you truly find yourself lost in this movie. And it gets better and better each time you see it! I went to the movies 6 times already to see it & each time I figured out more things I had missed the time before. This movie is charming & innovative & it dared to go where no other filmmaker in our time has dared. Russell Crowe DESERVED that Oscar for his role in this movie & was absolutley appalled at the fact that he did not win. Simply put, this movie would NOT have been, if in fact it were not done by Russell Crowe~ RUSSELL CROWE WAS THIS MOVIE! Jennifer Connelley was incredible as well, and got her Oscar. It was unfair that the Academy saw to it that Russell only recieve his Oscar last year for Gladiator (which is another best film ever made!) and cheated him out of his rightful Oscar this time around. In a nutshell, A Beautiful Mind is Genius in itself. BUY IT!
B00005RJ1U|1.0|One star for this film is one star too many , unfortunately the review page won't let you put 0 stars .This film is basically &quot;The Hitcher&quot; , &quot;Dual&quot; + &quot;Texas Chainsaw Massacre&quot; all rolled into one . On the face of it that might not seem like a bad place to start , unfortunately this film is totally lacking any of the qualities that made those 3 films classics and ends up being so predictable , boring + totally lacking in suspence or imagination that the only good thing about watching this film on video as opposed to at the cinema is that you can fast forward through all the dull bits - of which there are many . I thought films like &quot;Scream&quot; were supposed to have put an end to mindless drivel like this . Take my advice and give this film a miss , life's just too short !
0671024256|5.0|This is a hard sell to my Christian writer friends, but I tell them if they love me they will read it. I tell them between this and Anne Lamott's book 'Bird by Bird', you've got the best stuff on writing this planet has seen. I tell them if they want to learn, they will read it. <br />I'm not a horror genre fan, but this book is a handful of gold on the craft of storytelling. The truth in it has cut loose two nasty problems in my writing, problems on their way to correction. My gratefulness to Stephen King for this book is permanent.
B00005JLCI|5.0|It is rather trite to proclaim this version to be the \\"best Hamlet ever\\". I agree that it is a particularly wonderful production. It is beautifully executed and rich in texture, but to declare it \\"best\\" is to do a disservice to all other film adaptations of the Shakespeare classic.<br />What we are discussing is a piece of art, not a sports contest. One can immerse oneself fully in the lushness and excitement of Branagh's version, yet also appreciate Olivier's 1948 stark and deeply brooding portrayal, presented on the spare, bleek, black and white film canvas. They are simply different approaches to the telling of the same story.<br />I have begun a collection of \\"Hamlet\\"s and when the Branagh version is available, I will be one of the first to buy it. I highly recommend this film, but I would urge everyone to see the other versions and try to discern what the intent of the filmakers was and why they took slightly divergent paths in order to tell the story in a different way.
0441172717|5.0|I have been turning up the pace on my reading lately, and last time I entered a book store I remembered multiple friends had been urging me to read Frank Herbert's Dune. I snagged a copy of the book, and noted on the drive home that Arthur C. Clarke was quoted as saying &quot;the only thing I know comparable is Lord of the Rings.&quot; I could not help but consider this an extremely bold statement.<br />As I read it, however, it did not take long for me to realize how true this statement rings. In Dune, Frank Herbert has crafted a dizzyingly imaginative universe. Every social group and race of people, from the Bene Gesserit to the Harkonnens to the Sardaukar to the Fremen is described in such mad detail that one cannot help but believe these societies exist in some remote corner of our universe. The ecology and geology of the planet Arrakis, from the sandworms to the barren deserts, are crafted with such grace that there is no doubt in my mind Arrakis has to be real somewhere in the galaxy, if not merely inside of Frank Herbert's head.<br />And it gets better. All of the characters, from the confused-yet-focused Paul Atriedes, to the Baron Harkonnen, one of the easiest to hate villains ever crafted, are completely real and filled with depth, and the way they interact with the world around them is absolutely believable.<br />All of the characters are involved in a breath-takingly epic story of politics and religion, with many subtle and not-so-subtle parallels of our own society interwoven with the entertaining quest. However, this grand story never overtakes the development of the individual characters, which always remains key to Dune. I didn't feel like I was reading a story with a beginning and end and a clear message to be brought out of it as I read Dune. I felt like I was watching these people play out a small portion of their lives, and when it was all over I was heart-broken that I would not be able to follow them any longer.<br />In the end, I could only agree with Arthur C. Clarke's assessment of Dune. The amazing degree of craftsmanship in creating the planet of Arrakis has not been seen in any book less epic then J.R.R. Tolkien's Lord of the Rings, and, if it is possible, I found Dune to be even more believable. Despite my hectic class schedule this quarter, I found a way to tear through this book in under a week. If you have not read Dune, pick up a copy: you will not be disappointed.<br />Exaggerated one-line review: Dune is science fiction's Lord of the Rings.
0141301104|5.0|This book is one of Roald Dahl's greatest books. This book never seems slow. Not even for a chapter. When Luke and his grandma go to a hotelin England, he finds himself with witches and then.... Well to find out you should read the book.
6302000823|5.0|This is about love, family, friendship...loss and adversity...sadness and humor. It is a story filled with truths of real life and is acted beautifully.  It takes you into the hearts and souls of very real people. Everyone will see something of themselves in this story.  If you have ever cared deeply for another person, you'll love this film.  If you've ever been to Italy and want to recapture the feeling of small town life there, you'll love this film.  Get the sub-titled version to get the true feeling - it comes through despite the language barrier.
B00000JLWW|5.0|This three hour movie is excellent!!! In the first hour and a half it really protrayed the characters that were on the the boat in 1912. And the second part, great effects, great stunts and very INTENSe!!! This movie is two thumbs way up!
B00003CXBK|5.0|This has got to be the greatest full-length Anime movie ever. I watched it three times in a row. But, I have a few problems with it, #1 Is it just me, or is it kind of hard to hear most of the animal gods when they talk? #2 I really wish they made a special edition DVD, I need more extras! Were's the commentary's? Why isn't there a behind the scenes, (The Featurette doesn't do anything) And #3, Why wasn't it nominated for anything? Oh well, it's still a great movie, and if you know me, I reccommend watching this late at night.
B00003CY0V|4.0|Lots of action, computers, twists, bad guy/good guy. John Travolta was a little over the top, but Hugh Jackman and Halle Berry were great and they have excellent chemistry. Basically Hugh, stole the movie. Watch it for the action, Hugh and Halle.
B000008DXB|4.0|This is another solid J.J.Cale album from way back in 1974. This one's not as good as Naturally or Troubadour, but it has a few great songs like: I'll Be There, Everlovin' Woman, &amp; Any Way The Wind Blows.
B00005YXZH|5.0|I love this record.  Especially turned up loud.  Then you get to hear all the backround noises going on.  You hear little clips of songs coming up. Little clips of what it sounds like a radio. It's beautiful.  And yes Jeff is getting a little out there with his lyrics. But after listening to it again, and getting to read the lyrics,  it kind of all makes sense.  It's personal this time.  Really personal. I love the flow, the sounds, his voice especially.  His voice is really subtle and lovely.  Buy it.  Oh.. I was also a pirate of the recording and bought the real deal because Wilco deserves everything. Wilco without a doubt is the best band because of how diverse they can be and still be proud of each record--which is so different from the next.
0446343129|5.0|I am not exagerating when I say this book changed my life. It has been 23 years since I first read The Sugar Blues and it has been reaffirmed repeatedly in that time. The history of sugar helped me to undertand how it worked it's way into the modern diet and the scientific descriptions of what happens to sugar as it is refined clarified the root problem. I am not diebetic or hypoglycemic and yet my metabolism simply cannot process this poison. I was a depressed child with bad skin until good chiropractic care and this book turned things around for me. Anybody with acne should read this book and make it their Bible.
B000003TAW|5.0|I could go on and on about how this CD changed my life, but I won't bore you.  Let me just say though, that before I heard of weezer, I had no idea of what existed out there for music.  This was their first CD, and since they got radio air time with the relased songs- the sweater song in particular- I was able to explore a whole new genere of music ages ago when it came out.  This album is full of catchy tunes and funny lyrics and it is all thrown at you in that poppy/emoish way.  I think the best song on the album is &quot;surf wax america&quot;.  The whole album is great though.  There is not a song that I skip over.  And I have been a devoted fan since this album came out and have not been disappointed yet.
B00005JKCF|5.0|Spider-Man is the MOST anticipated movie of my life thus far. This even surpasses Resident Evil and X-Men.  Batman and Superman pail in comparison to this movie.  When I first saw the trailer my heart started thumping so fast, adrenaline started rushing.  I saw this trailer at JPIII so during the entire movie of Jurassic Park III I was replaying that Spider-Man trailer in my head over and over again.  This movie will not disappoint, it can't it's Spider-Man!!  I don't know one person who does not like Spider-Man.  I hope to the Lord that this movie will bring in more money than some friggin' Harry Potter.  Go see this movie, it will amaze you!!  <br />P.S.  on a side note I hope that the Lizard and Doc Ock make their appearances in the sequel.<br />Be safe everyone
0399208534|5.0|This book is another one I discovered while working in a elementary school. It was a big hit with the K - Gr. 2 kids. They thought the story was interesting. The author actually does a good job of making the caterpillar a character kids could invest in. They wanted to know what was going to happen to it. Would it ever stop eating? The book also helped the children who were having trouble learning the days of the week and counting. Loved the art work, too. Some of the more advanced kids were had lots of questions about the science of the caterpillar turning into a butterfly. This is is just a wonderful book that young boys and girls really enjoy. If you child hasn't read the story yet, it's a must have!
0140437843|5.0|The essence of the book can be summed up when Dorian Grey wishes that his portrait to age, get old and decay but he should remain young and beautiful for ever! He not only accomplishes it but convinces others to this remarkable feat. He is so conceited, self absorbed and without any conscious that after he murders his true friend, he goes to bed and has a good night sleep. Dorian Grey is one of the most bizarre charecters in literature. I guess we all have a little bit of Dorian Grey in us at times, hopefully in small doses. Lord Henry, the quick witted,<br /> brilliant companion is none other than Oscar Wilde. A<br />remarkable book. If it were written today, there would be lot of<br /> controversy as the male charecters bond so freely. Oscar Wilde himself was accused of homosexual act and was sent to jail for<br />two years. He left England and moved to France where he died at a<br />very young age. What a loss?
B0000640SA|2.0|At the end of this movie, you're supposed to go \\"Wow! That's brilliant!\\" Instead, I was quite glad that it was over. It starts off with an interesting enough premise, but quickly gets way too wrapped up in its own clever structure and plot twists, and ends up degenerating into an experiemntal wank. I like smart movies, but this one just tries way too hard. I emerged from it feeling like I had just been forced into a duel with the director, with him trying to outsmart me every step back of the way when all I was looking for was a couple hours' entertainment. In the end, he succeeds in showing how clever he is, but does so at the expense of a good movie.
B00005U16N|5.0|This movie wasn't really even that well known when released into theaters. Blow was out of the limelight of Traffic, another drug movie which happens to be horrible. <br />Blow's script is much more realistic, something that cn be related to. It's all about a drug dealer's journey to wealth through the game. But I must say that this is one of the best, most interesting movies out there now.<br />If you do any type of drug, you will be guaranteed to like this movie. If you don't, then you must be high!
B000001EPB|5.0|Well, I saw &quot;Riverdance&quot; this week and without comparing the dancing in the two shows (since I could never do any of it), I really like Ronan Hardiman's music for &quot;Lord of the Dance&quot; a lot better.  From the opening track &quot;Cry of the Celts&quot; you get the feel of listening to an Irish band cooking in a pub someplace.  Hardiman offers up a rich diversity of tunes, from the ephemeral &quot;Celtic Dream&quot; (that reminds me of the Nutcracker for some reason) to the pounding rhythms of &quot;Warriors.&quot;  I wish &quot;Gypsy&quot; were longer, because that is probably my favorite track.  Hardiman himself provides the keyboard/programming for this wonderful mix of ancient sounds with modern technology.  After all, who thinks of Irish music with a saxophone like you have on &quot;Fiery Nights?&quot;  It is usually Uilleann Pipes and serious fiddle playing, both of which abound on this album.  The two bonus tracks featuring the solo taps of Michael Flatley with the Lord of the Dance troupe are enough for the CD; you can always put on the video to hear more of the same, but I would think that after a while you can really just hear the tapping in your mind all the time anyway.  Yes, you will enjoy this music more having seen the show, but I actually enjoyed listening to this CD for months before I bothered to check out the tape.
B000002LK1|5.0|I highly recommend this CD to anyone, from people only partially interested in DM, or to fans! This is one CD where you won't have to skip over any tracks, because each and every one of these songs is awesome!<br />&quot;Enjoy The Silence&quot; is probably my favorite song EVER. &quot;Personal Jesus&quot; also ranks high.<br />Get this CD right away!
B00003CXTG|5.0|I found this movie to be an exceptional way to introduce that horrific day to a younger generation. I was deeply moved by this movie in the theatre and bought it as soon as it came out. My four year old watches this movie and loves it. He asks questions and this gives me an opportunity to start to explain this time in our history. Yes, it was a Hollywood love story also, but it made people start talking about it again, and thats the best way to educate and remember those men and women who lost their lives in that battle. I grew up watching Tora,Tora,Tora; something our younger generation did not readily see or talk about with their grandparents. A must see for everyone.
B00003CXAA|4.0|Personally I missed the chance of watching The Godfather in theaters. Maybe because I was born on the same year the 1st part of The Godfather came out :)<br />After watching this collection, I can't but admire the acting job and the movies but hate this DVD collection! Why? For the following reasons:<BR>1. Each part comes on a DVD that has nothing on it but the movie itself. Just Scenes Selection, Play The Movie & Set Up.<BR>2. The God Father 2 comes on two DVDs!!! Can you imagine changing DVDs in the middle of watching the movie?!! The film was 200 minutes long. Why on earth it was put on two DVDs instead of one?!!<BR>3. The documentary (Bonus DVD) is worthless!!! For God's sake, how can they satisfy The Godfather fans with such non sense?!! This movie is a master piece in cinema history, how could they insult us all with such meaningless bonuses?!!<br />I give 5 stars to The Godfather but zero stars for this DVD Collection.
B000001GX8|4.0|If anyone is interested, this set holds ALOT of memories for me.  It was the first complete opera set I ever really listened to constantly and so it has a special place in my heart.  That being said, it is no longer my favorite \\"Figaro\\".  That title must go to John Eliot Gardiner's amazing set on Archiv.  I strongly urge anyone who wants to understand this opera to purchase that performance.  But this set still has much to commend it.  Bohm coaxes certain phrases like no one else.  The letter duet is a fine example.  Enjoy it because you are unlikley to hear it with so much color, lushness and passion again soon.  Unfortunately, Bohm often misses the fun and zip in the score.  Things tend to be a tad weighted down and the comedy fails to register.  Surprisingly the overture does not get treated this way and is a joy.  <BR>The cast is great but there are some glarring problems.  First of all, few of them are very at home with Italian.  True this piece is not \\"Italian\\" in terms of style but that is the language and this cast's problems with it is a distraction.  Prey and Mathis are an old-fashioned Figaro and Susanna which means big, cuddly guy and china doll.  While I feel there is more to these characters, this approach can be heart-warming to listen to.  Prey is in glorious voice, warm and sunny and the liner notes are right to refer to a \\"smile in the voice\\".  Mathis is a bit thin in arias but sounds much more at home in the ensembles.  And Fischer-Dieskau?  Haha!  What an artist!  His voice is at full power and he pours his interpertation into each note.  This Count is a raging psychopath burning with lust!  Most lines are snarled out in a way that chills the blood.  A contrast with Gilfry's controlled aristocrat on the Gardiner set is fascinating.  I like Gilfry better but Dieskau certainly left his stamp on the part and creates just as valid a character.  Janowitz IS the Countess.  I've heard enough by now to say that.  She achieves total identification with the character.  All others I have heard and seen (so far) are either blank slates (the bad ones) or get a part of Janowitz's whole (the good ones).  I know plenty of you will sneer at that but that's how I hear it.  Janowitz has a golden line of a voice that stretches through the entire score.  You think \\"Sooner or later there will be a sign of strain or wear and tear\\" but it never comes.  The voice is lyrical but with strength underneath it.  It is simply pure.  Someone who I usually disagree with on vocal matters said upon hearing it \\"That's just a perfect voice.\\"  Dramitically we get the Countess's fear, anger, flirtatiousness, love, regret, nobility and simplicity.  Nothing is missing.  We should all feel lucky that this definitive performance was captured whole in such a fine recording.  <BR>The supporting cast is fairly strong.  Troyanos is lovely and funny as Cherubino although Bohm does not seem too interested in the character.  Lagger and Johnson are in good voice and act well but they don't sound like they are having much fun.  In contrast, Wohlfahrt and Hirte have ok voices but do a super job of hamming up their parts.  It's great to hear Wohlfahrt, a fine singer in such a rich part.  Vogel is cute and matches Troyanos well.  Vantin has a very nice voice and sings his heart out in the \\"Mia Madre\\" sextet but (once again!) he doesn't sound very funny.  The two girls are fine.  One last complaint: the recitatives are not done well by today's standards.  The cast and Bohm seem to regard them as something to get through fast.  Prey, Dieskau and Janowitz are exceptions to this however.  Chorus and orchestra are both super.  Sound is boxy but clear.  Great liner notes.  <BR>Perhaps the only real problem with this set is a lack of fun.  Bohm sees this opera as deeply profound.  It most certainly is but part of it's profundity lies in it's sense of joy.  This aspect is muted (although not lost) here.  The \\"Mia Madre\\" sextet is a good example.  In this set it playedas deeply moving (which it is) but there are not really any laughs.  \\"Figaro\\" is a sublime comedy.  The comedy can not be so secondary.  Without it, we loose some of the point which is to see life as something of a comedy.  On the other hand, if one plays down the sublime the opera becomes a simple and vulgar farce.  Perhaps if you must mute one aspect, it is better to mute the comedy.  But there really should be a ballance.  Still, when all is said and done this is a great reccording.  It preserves many top-notch performances and an entire way of viewing this deathless masterpiece.  This view (usually seen as the \\"German\\" view) may be out of favor, but it touched many people and served Mozart well.  Indeed, it can still speak to us today if we are willing to be patient.  Don't make this your only \\"Figaro\\" but don't be without it if you love this opera.
0060278234|5.0|Best book yet by fantasy writer Garth Nix. Second book is series and not the last. I've read this book over 8 times and I still love it. I can't wait for the third book, Abhorsen, to come out
1577311523|5.0|This is the first and only self-help book I will ever read. It takes you from here to there, eternally, and then sits on the shelf or table for anyone who is interested in finally changing their life. You can read it slowly, learning how to take your time in all things and live only in the now. Thank you to New World Library, and to Eckhart Tolle.
B000002H5I|3.0|The only reason I'm giving this 3 stars is Crossroads is so much better... if you've never heard any Tracy Chapman I'd suggest you start with that album, but this is very good as well. A couple of the songs sound very studio-ized, commercial, etc, but the lyrics are above and beyond most of the stuff being put out today- and it's interesting to see how she began. There are a few GREAT songs on this album as well.
B000059XY3|4.0|This is the first of the live action movies since 1989 to tone down the dark knight to the semi-dark knight (which is better than the cheesy knight which comes later).  Still, with that in mind (and the fact that they ditched Tim Burton, Micheal Keaton, and Danny Elfman) this is a pretty good movie.  Jim Carey's Riddler is a tiny bit over-the-top and Tommy Lee Jones's Two-Face is a bit too humorous for my tatses (I blame this on a script that completly deleted his tragic story).  Val Kilmer makes for a pretty good Batman/Bruce Wayne.  Nicole Kidman plays the love intrest that anyone with eyes would fall for.  Chris O'Donnell played Robin well (the \\"Holy rusted metal, Batman\\" line was a nice flashback to the old TV series and forgivable).  And Alfred is fun as usual.  I was kinda hoping for Catwoman to pop up at some point, especially after Batman Returns, but oh well. . .  As I said, it's a fine movie, but it led the way for an evil, cheesy version that followed two years later.
B000026156|5.0|When I saw a CD featuring Sam Rivers with Anthony Braxton - two of my favorite people in all music - with the great Dave Holland and Barry Altchull - I knew it was going to be phenomenal. I was not disappointed.<br />Holland is an awesome bass player as well as a creative composer. His compositions are both far out and highly structured. This is a perfect setting for Braxton - the master of structure and restructure, and for Rivers - an amazing soloist and a great composer himself.<br />It is interesting to hear some of Holland's European background in these compositions - especially in the title track. They do not dominate the music - but they exist and add something to the overall sound.<br />There is great variety in the music here. If you like &quot;Energy Playing&quot; - you have it spread across the cd - See Saw, Q&amp;A, Interception. If you want collective improvization - it is happening throughout. If you want subtle sounds and forms - you got it in abundance - in the title track, in Nowhere (Now here.<br />I believe the playing of the horn players on this CD should provide inspiration for all creative musicians - as an example of controlled freedom, expression and technical skill.<br />Holland's great ability to mix different forms of expression in a beautiful way is a dominant feature in this CD. Another feature is Altchull - who as a drummer has a lot to say in the direction the compositions are taking - and shares the credit for the final result.<br />I recommend this CD to people who want creative music, expressive and controlled, and performed brilliantly by some of the leading musicians in the so called &quot;Avantgarde&quot; movement.
B00005MAM2|5.0|I remember seeing this a few years ago with the old dub.  When this version was released I snatched it up as fast as I could.  I was completely blown away.  I watched it twice in a row.  First with the new dub second with the Japanese.  The new dub is pretty good actually, a huge improvement in my opinion over the original (though I do miss the old dub's \\"Kaneda!  Help me!!\\").  The Japanese track was surprising.  This is one of the few anime where the mouth moves with the works.  Whoa. . .  The picture is also amazing.  If I didn't know better, I'd swear that this was made in the last two or three years!  The animation is smooth, crisp, and consistant.  The story is great; complex and gripping which is especially good since they took a HUGE manga/comic series and condensed it to a two hour movie (unlike X where they take a huge story and condense it to 90 minutes and butcher it completely).  If you've never seen any anime before, go get it.  If you've never seen this movie, go get it.  If you've never seen this version, go get it.  Do I think this is one of those movies that any movie fan has to see?  Oh HECK yes!!
0679879269|5.0|I recently read The Amber Spyglass and the last third of the book would give any reader pause for thought, but especially Christians in America. I couldn't help but think that if an American author had written this book, it probably wouldn't have been published. We have a very strong Christian contingent in this country, and publishers hesitate to take a chance on anything outside the norm. The Christians are the \\"bad guys\\" in Pullman's trilogy. Philip Pullman is a British author. So is J. K. Rowling. Before Harry Potter, Philip Pullman was just another children's book author whose books were known within a small group of children's book advocates. Now he is recommended as a follow-up to Rowling. His books are well written and layered; the characterizations are memorable, and the ideas presented will color a reader's thoughts for a long time. I hope many copies are sold. But if so, it's not the quality; it's public demand in the United States. It bothers me that so few foreign language books are translated into English and published in the United States, while the opposite is true of American books....
B00005Y7AW|5.0|Rufus,<BR>   you are the man.  What can I say?  Your cd is a gem, perfect, intelligent yet accessible, biting, funny, sad, beautiful, just PLAIN PERFECT.  Thank you for making the kind of music few others do.
078062999X|5.0|I read a rumor which was confirmed by a studio bulletin that Branaugh's Hamlet will be out later this year on DVD. I can't wait.<BR>     This is for my money the definitive version of Hamlet. Not that the other versions have been crummy. They haven't. But getting the whole text and finally seeing Hamlet played as incredibly intelligent, crafty and cunning instead of just mad and sad is really exciting. Also a real shocker is to see Kate Winslet play Ophelia as a clear headed woman and then a grief stricken daughter instead of an incomprehensible nutcase you usually get. Its just awesome. What you learn from this version is everybody is important and interesting in this play. Even little characters have significant interesting motivations. When you shorten it to two hours you have a mountain of characters you have to introduce and dispose of quickly.  So you are watching this movie and saying to yourself, &quot;Finally I really understand everyone and everything that is going on.&quot; Check out one of the reviews of a twelve year old below. This is Shakespeare that draws you in and can follow. You won't be left wondering why the play is held in such high esteem by Shakespeare afficionados.  I am just a layman but I am crazy about it.  I have to mention Charleton Heston as the head of the acting troop. He acts the hell out of what I always thought was a trivial part of the film.  He turns it into one of the films really big moments.  As good as he is Jack Lemmon is  cast as a tower guard who sees King Hamlet's ghost near the beginning of the film. I can't tell you how painful his scenes are to watch. He is just embarassingly terrible. Its the equivalent of putting Jar Jar Binks in Star Wars. Fortunately he isn't on screen for too long. I felt so bad for him. Just about everyone else is good or interesting or great. The film is beautiful and lush. See the versions of Hamlet too if you like but this is my personal choice for the &quot;must see&quot; version of Hamlet.
B00004Z459|5.0|One of the best album ever made. Loved each and every song in the album. The song videos are amazing too.
B0000648WZ|1.0|The disappointing thing about this movie is the apparent hostility that the director and screenwriter had for the concepts in the original novel.  For them to make a sci-fi action movie giving us their view of the future is one thing.  To (apparently) deliberately take another artist's work and distort his vision is entirely another.<br />I often find myself in disagreement with Mr. Heinlein on many issues, but to take his work, deliberately change the message of that work and then use his title in an apparent attempt to capitalize on his reputation is reprehensible and, for me at least, prevents me from enjoying the rather good technical aspects of the film.
B000000OQF|5.0|My title of my review says it all. All 12 tracks on this classic masterpiece are exactly that. This album is the rock n' roll bible. Everybody should own it! The best and most complete album ever hands down! Every song rocks! from the beginning of &quot;Welocome to the Jungle&quot; when Axl says Oh my God over the best intro of any song to this day to &quot;Rocket Queen&quot;,which is my personal favorite. If you don't have this in your cd collection my heart goes out to you because you are missing out big time! GNFR!

B00005YXZH|5.0|I purchased this album last night after waiting months for it to come out (i have been an uncle tupelo fan ever since i heard no depression years ago....and have continued enjoying the diverging releases of both tweedy and farrar...anyway, i diverge).  i saved the first listen for a long late night drive.  initially i was extremly disappointed, couldn't even get through it.  however, i am sitting at this moment on a rainy sunday afternoon going through my third straight through listen.  once again, unsurprisingly, wilco has released a fantastic album.  while i have liked all of the previous releases, i felt that for the most part they were usually too poppy and borderline saccharine, except for being there, which i think is an album of genius.  this album is anything but saccharine.  some have referred to the production as bells and whistles.  nah....this is sublimely beautiful stuff.  an absolute pleasure to listen to.  who cares if it isn't alt-country....while much that falls into that realm is great, it is a little worn by now.  frankly, i am delighted that this diverges from that vein.  i hate to make the comparison, but i must say that compared to where farrar is going, this is far more interesting. <br />buy this cd (especially if you have downloaded it first), brew a good pot of french roast, and watch the rain.  The cd will just become part of your consiousness.
B00003CY6M|5.0|In my opinion, this is the finest Romance film I have ever witnessed, and one of the finest films i have seen.<br />Their love truly transcends the boundaries of time. Though Cusack and Beckinsale only spend roughly 15mins on-screen together, it is a very good 15 minutes. Most of the time I was vouching for them to meet each other but with the constant near-misses (of them meeting each other later) I was frought with frustration at them not meeting. Here the plot wasn't as predictable as it seemed *spoiler ahead* (as it could've ended with them not meeting ,and it all for nothing) this was meant to be a romantic \\"feel good\\" drama and it certainly lived up to expectations.<br />Beckinsale proves her acting ability lies in her true British self, and Cusack embodies the American romantic. The film is shot well with wonderful use of snow drops in key scenes; New York is witnessed in all its glory. <br />The happy ending is truly marvellous, atleast they finally meet (attention you must suspend belief, but it works!!). Echoes of the Family Man are also seen, a movie i truly loved as well (10/10 for that one). The dollar bill, the Book, the glove and the \\"Serendipity\\" shop will always be in my mind forever, as a symbol for eternal love. <br />Does fate truly operate in our lives? Is destiny pre-determined? Should we seek love, or let love come to us? Nevertheless we must make best every opportunity we have, as seen by Cusack's initial chance encounter developing into something much much more.<br />Watch for very interesting comic relief, but overall this movie is serious and challenging in nature. <br />10/10
B00004ZELJ|5.0|The sound quality of the DVD is NOT that bad, a concert would not be a concert if you can't hear the screaming of the fans especially at a BACKSTREET BOYS' concert where fans go crazy!  Go to a BSB concert and try listen to the screaming live! I personally think that the concert was quite unique from the other BSB dvd's.  I'm a HUGE BSB fan and I own every single DVD of the Backstreet Boys you could possibly find, and I love this one especially because of the solo's.  I know they had solos in \\"A Night Out with the BSB\\" but this one was more energetic whereas the other was more intimate atmosphere.  IT's from 1998 a while ago so obviously the stage presence, the costume changes are no where near as good as the Millennium and Black & Blue concerts.  But without all those dancers around them they seem more original especially in the accapella of \\"Just Wanna Be Close to You\\", it's fun to watch their old DVD's and I think BSB rocks!! I never get sick of watching all their DVD's, they are awesome!<br />KTBSPA!!!!!<br />Karen
B00005AR3G|4.0|It's hilarious all throughout the movie. It bases on lifes features. How man's nature really is toward having so much ambition and temptation to have more. But there are situations where life cycles around and changes the perspective of man. Ovearll it is a recommendable movie for the whole family. It will keep you laughing until the end.
B00005QZ7U|5.0|There is no doubt for me about this statement: Moulin Rouge was the best movie of 2001. An orpheus-like story told with pop music and visual enlightment. I know many people didnt like it, but there is no question about this: this movie is spectacular, deep, emotional, ironic... its an encyclopedic mix of genres and influences. Nicole Kidman gave a wonderful performance. I was surprised by the beautiful tone of her voice, almost liric. Ewan McGregors voice is pretty acceptable as well, and his acting is spotless: his development from a naive eye-wide-opened youngster to a depressed, beard and isolated mature guy is outstanding. The comedy works just as well as the tragedy. The music is wonderful and the dance numbers are really great. All of this coming from a person who hates musicals... thats just how good this movie is. Go along with Christian in his way to conquer Satines heart only to find out that the social conditions she has been living in for years are imposible to erase... the scars of the lies are in her very breath and the miserable conditions of her life (hidden behind sparkling dresses and oppresive corss) have left a tragic fate. Christian, unaware of this, writes a play to turn the Moulin Rouge into a theater, a house of art... but to accomplish this he, Satine and Harold Zidler (Moulin Rouges owner) must put everything in the Dukes hands. Then Satine must play the dukes heart, so the transformation of this place into an art temple can go on. How long can the affair between the writer and the performer stay in the shadows without the producer noticing? The fight between Apollo and Dioniosios and their rituals shown in a new way: the romance (as an artistic genre) is born after this fight in the which none of the previous ones survive. Its melancholic, yet spectacular... its idealistic, yet quite mundane. In years people will hardly remember A beautiful Mind, but Moulin Rouge will become a classic.<BR>A plus reason for having this movie is its perfect DVD release. I can say this is the BEST DVD I have. There are a lot of extras and phantom pills. There are music videos, outtakes, different versions of some scenes and multiple angles of the dance sequences, etc. And the look of the menus and the box is just beautiful. The truth is that this is also the best DVD release of 2001.
B000002UC5|4.0|The reception that this eponymous album got when it was released was, er, mixed (that may be \\"at best\\").  It was Paul McCartney's first solo work, and expectations were high and for songs of a different nature.  \\"McCartney\\" the solo album does not have much instrumental texture.  In fact, the entire ensemble is Paul and his new wife at the time, the former photographer Linda Eastman.  Fittingly, the LP cover was graced by a sweet photograph of the head of their newborn baby peaking outside from Paul's coat, like a kangaroo baby.  <br />What was produced was a homey, mostly soft, and melodic group of songs.  They have rich verselines and music, superior in quality to Paul's later poppish, radio-friendly stuff like \\"Let 'Em In\\" and \\"Silly Love Songs.\\"  The rocker \\"Maybe I'm Amazed\\" is, well, amazing.  It is one of the two best-ever Beatles solo songs, along with \\"It Don't Come Easy.\\"  Paul's wonderful, highly evocative verseline inspires a terrific, soulful lead guitar line.<br />The rest is very pretty, atmospheric stuff--again, not in terms of instrumental texture but homeyness.  The opening cut, a simple and short ode to \\"The Lovely Linda,\\" sets the tone.  \\"Junk\\" and \\"Singalong Junk\\" are absolutely precious, altho reverse naming is needed to describe which is the instrumental.  Very little amounts to wasted material, and anything that is is much more than counterbalanced by nice tracks such as \\"Man We Was Lonely,\\" \\"Every Night,\\" \\"That Would Be Something,\\" and the lilting \\"Teddy Boy,\\" slightly reminiscent of \\"Rocky Raccoon.\\"  The relatively more lively tracks include \\"Oo You\\" and several instrumentals, featuring Paul's guitar.  Still, the overall feel to this solo album is domestic and peaceful, sort of an escape, and quite unique, and that is why it will always be special.
B00000D9TK|4.0|I am not a Celine Dion fan - in English, that is. THIS is how she was meant to be heard! It isn't just \\"Celine singing in French\\" (a language I barely understand), it is Celine singing better songs, and singing them better. She offers none of the hyper-emotional power-belting so typical of her mega-hits, but well-inflected vocals that cover a range of emotions and musical styles. It's flat-out better music, thanks in no small part to the exquisite arrangements of Jean-Jacques Goldman.<br />Two tracks lead the pack: \\"Je Crois Toi\\" (I Believe You), Track 1, and On Ne Change Pas (People Don't Change), Track 3. They are so gorgeous, they alone make this a CD worth having. If I've had a rough day, I often put on these two songs and everything is better - they're that good.  In \\"Je Crois Toi\\", Celine is alternately gentle, coaxing, emphatic, teasing and just plain thrilling. It is (to borrow a French phrase) a tour de force - a remarkable display of what she can do vocally. In the last minute of the song her voice flutters in tight little trills that send chills up my spine. \\"On Ne Change Pas\\" is a delightfully happy and melodic tune that builds gradually and then seems to bud, blossom and then take flight as the key changes suddenly in the middle of the song.<br />There are other songs I enjoy on the CD, notably the bluesy \\"Terre\\", \\"L'abandon\\" and \\"Dans Un Autre Monde\\".  There are others that don't do much for me (hence the lack of a 5th star), but my overall comment is that THIS collection turned me into a Celine Dion fan.
B000002UCQ|5.0|George Harrison's finest Beatles solo work came early on, and All Things Must Pass glows just like any of the avatars in his eastern (well, more Central Asian) consciousness.  \\"My Sweet Lord\\" may have plagiarized one of the Chiffons' riffs, but it is beautiful and epitomizes the spiritual richness of this collection, which is more sincere and less sanctimonious than his later work.  This richness is enhanced by the great production work of Phil Spector, who demonstrates he has abilities for more than the melodramatic.  Spector had a lot to work with, for George is supported by quite an array of musicians, including Eric Clapton, Badfinger, keyboardist Billy Preston, and bass guitarist Klaus Voormann, all of whom later graced the ensemble for the Concert for Bangladesh.  Other Layla personnel are on the credits:  Jim Gordon (percussion), Bobby Whitlock (keyboards), and Carl Radle (bass).  George was very talented himself as a lead guitarist and songwriter, and his very best Beatles songs matched those of Lennon/McCartney.  But his songwriting peaked on this album, on which his spiritual/passionate numbers can be cheerful (\\"What Is Life\\"), darkly mystical (\\"Beware of Darkness\\"), zippy (\\"Awaiting on You All\\"), drearily contemplative (\\"Isn't It a Pity\\"), introspective (\\"Wah-Wah\\"), and offbeat (\\"I Dig Love\\").  One of the best songs is \\"Apple Scruffs,\\" acoustic-guitar-laden (and great harmonica accompaniment). Inspired by the groupies that hung around The Beatles' Apple studios, it is one of George's most evocative songs ever.  He also does a great cover of Bob Dylan's \\"If Not For You,\\" backed by gorgeous guitar and keyboard work.  I have no hesitation in placing the music quality on All Things Must Pass on a par with that of Layla, for after all, the entire Layla lineup except for Duane Allman kicks in, and also performs some great rock and roll jamming on Disk Two.  In terms of overall song quality, I acknowledge that this album is slightly second best to Clapton's great solo masterpiece, but it arguably is not on Disk One.  All Things Must Pass is the best Beatles solo album exclusive of greatest hits, and is also one of the all-time classic recordings.
0380002930|5.0|The other reviews will give you lowdown on the story.  I simply wanted to give praise where praise is due.  Outstanding tale.
B000002NBY|5.0|Even my son, not quite two, loves this record. From a parent's perspective this is great because it introduces new beats and rhythms to children. I have been listening to Graceland since I was 11, and I'm 26 now. Paul Simon's lyrics are intelligent and sensitive, mixing the concrete with the ethereal. A good example is &quot;The Boy in the Bubble,&quot; discussing scientific achievement and its effects on the human condition. Overall just a fantastic album for anyone. The sound is pop enough to not drive off those who like more mainstream music, but still eclectic enough to draw a diverse listenership.
B00005NW02|5.0|Rock n roll baby....rock n roll!  System of a down has rejuviated my faith in rock n roll, or should I say &quot;NU METAL&quot;.<BR>I discovered these guys on the &quot;not another teen movie&quot; soundtrack and after hearing &quot;the metro&quot; a few times I ran out and bought their first album only to turn around and go get this one also.....now I can only be patient and hope that nothing bad happens to these Armenian badasses untill their next one.....After the split up of RAGE AGAINST THE MACHINE I was hearbroken and bummed. System helped cure that pain! <BR>I had to listen to toxicity 2 or 3 times to fall in love like i did with their first one but i'm stuck now! BUY THIS ALBUM AND THE FIRST ONE! Definite must haves.
B00003W8NM|5.0|I can see why 'Fight Club' would be easy to hate, but I can't see how it's possible not to simultaneously love it.<br />It is just so incredibly cool! David Fincher is clearly developing the filmmaking techniques of the future here, with special effects used non-obtrusively throughout the film. The man has a visual sense unmatched in mainstream cinema, and along with the clever and hilarious script this means the movie is like a long series of set pieces.<br />Those who dislike 'Fight Club' (excluding people who just can't cope with the actually-not-so-explicit violence) typically do so because they either see an offensive \\"message\\" in it (fascist, anarchist or conformist depending on the reviewer), aren't impressed with the level of insight achieved, or feel the film is a mess of contradictory ideas. The first group is clearly deluded, as the people behind the film have expressed healthy scepticism about any ideologies presented in the film, but the other two have a point. The film DOESN'T offer a solution, and it IS a mess of ideas and emotions. That's because it is about our culture at the eve of the Millennium, which is just as confused and inconclusive.<br />No, its (only) real flaw lies elsewhere, in the storytelling. The identity-twist near the end makes sense the second and third time you see the film, but on first viewing it seems artificial and constructed. Similarly, the faux-happy ending is too indistinguishable from genuine Hollywood schmaltz. These two points could have been communicated to the audience in a better way, but otherwise the film is just about flawless.
B00005U122|5.0|This DVD is worth bying in all aspects.  I have seen concerts and have collections of concert video but by far this has been the most valuable possesion. Roger Waters the man behind the success of the great band &quot;PINK FLOYD&quot; has this uncomparable sense of music thatcould really blow your mind.  This piece is a great buy and with no regrets. Recently I saw his Live concert in India and boy! everything I have seen is all there in this DVD. Try it if ya believe me. Remember &quot;NO REGRETS.&quot;
1573225517|4.0|The novel High Fidelity by Nick Hornby is a true tale of males views towards the opposite sex and the understanding of relationships.  Hornby puts the main character Rob through an all out search for love and how to find happiness. This novel will have you laughing as you follow Rob through his top five worst break ups while he seeks for what went wrong in these relationships.  With this light humor, it very easily sucks you into the tangled web of Robs life. If youve seen the movie and liked it you must read this excellent book.
B00005QZWI|5.0|I just want to say that if you love the movie, you will definitely love the music. My grandmother has never seen the movie but she loves the music. I know that I LOVE the music and I have seen the movie six times! If you can really get yourself into stories, you can get all emotional on the last two tracks. I'm not obsessive, I just love the movie and I think everyone should...except for my sister, she doesn't like it. I haven't figured out why. Well, this soundtrack is my favorite cd in the world and I can't wait to see the Two Towers! ~Andelu i ven~
6305169187|4.0|A crew of roughnecks, deep-sea drillers who can find the merest amounts of anything in the least accessible of spaces on earth, must now save the world from a monster-sized Asteroid less than 2 weeks away from striking Earth. The script of \\"Armageddon\\" attacks the threatening rock with the idea of landing the roughnecks and nuclear weapons  onto the rock itself. Only when planted as deep as 800 feet below the rock's surface - accessible only by the wonder drill machine pioneered by Bruce Willis's character, will the nuke be able to destroy the rock. Besides the expected problems - that just getting to the rock will require sneaking past a murderous screen of smaller asteroid fragments the bigger rock carries around like a private asteroid belt, that getting to the fault will require drilling through metals and minerals never encountered on earth and facinf deadly pockets of trapped steam - will be the roughnecks themselves, led by Bruce Willis and staffed by guys like AJ (Ben Affleck) and Rockhound (Steve Buscemi). (They're geniuses, but like Rockhound chose drilling because it gives them a chance to use their intellects and lots of explosives).<br />\\"Armageddon\\" is a better flick than critics - guys who complain about \\"popcorn movies\\" and who like to diss this flick as another testosterone-filled Bruckheimer/Simpson production - give it credit for. The action is relentless, but you never get punch drunk, and the typical macho characters - tough generals, brilliant scientists and a patriarchal president who looks inspired by FDR (not unlike the guy who played the president in \\"The Rock\\") - are never as heroic as the rebel-roughnecks who save the Earth. Though \\"Armageddon\\" relies on good special FX (which are actually spectacular) so do lots of other flicks which were nowhere near as good. (I saw this flick back-to-back with \\"Wing Commander\\"; which flick do you think I should have seen first?) Though a lot of lit looks like an extended music video or a commercial forarmed services recruiters (complete with a Thunderbirds fly-over) the script never loses its narrative (something you can't say for the extended Depeche Mode video they turned into (Alien3\\") The movie never leaves you behind, even though there will be long stretches where you'll probably have no idea what's going on. Ofcourse you'll want to see this in DVD.
B00005JKG9|5.0|1992 was quite a year.  We had Unforgiven, Bram Stoker's Dracula, A Few Good Men, Of Mice and Men (starring Sinise and Malkovitch), the director's cut of Blade Runner, and some other good films such as Sneakers, Raising Cain, and Scent of a Woman.  All of them are on DVD except for this film.  I really can't add much to the outstanding reviews that are already posted here.  This film, among with 12 Angry Men, stands as the best adaptation of a stage play to the big screen.  If and when a DVD is released, I hope that it includes the audio commentary recorded by Al Pacino and Jack Lemmon for the special edition Laserdisc release in 1994 (anyone who has that by the way is holding a treasure!).  It's only a matter of time before this is released on DVD.  This October (2002) is the tenth anniversary, and that would be the perfect time, assuming the legal hurdles have been taken care of.  Let's keep our fingers crossed!
B00005Q45W|5.0|This is the best CD Leonard Cohen has ever done.  All the songs<BR>are terrific, carefully selected, skillfully performed.  I love<BR>this CD!  Cohen just keeps getting better and better.
0345404475|4.0|While I definitely enjoyed this novel, I'm surprised more people who've seen the movie Blade Runner before reading the novel (probably most readers) aren't at least somewhat disappointed.  The novel moves along pretty quickly, and like most PKD novels, is easy to read, but I do have a couple of complaints. First, the androids that Deckard had to hunt down were somewhat of a letdown.  The story builds up to a climax where you expect an explosive ending, at least somewhat of a struggle between Deckard and the androids, but it didn't come across that way at all to me.  It was really anticlimactic. In that regard, the movie was more effective.  Second, I'm still not too clear on the whole Mercerism thing. I wish PKD had gone into more detail about Mercerism and fleshed things out a little bit.  <br />Still, it's a pretty entertaining novel.  Of the PKD novels I've read, it ranks around the middle.  My favorite is The Man in the High Castle, and I think I'd recommend it for people who haven't read any PKD novels yet before I would this one. One other comment: if you're still interested in the world of Blade Runner, the sequels written by K.W. Jeter aren't too bad at all.  Like PKD novels, they're easy to read, and though they're not great, at least you can spend more time (sort of) in the world originally constructed by Philip K. Dick.
B00005OAIE|4.0|This is one of the best albums to come of the music scene in some time...and in reference to other reviewers...He DOES talk about himself and how he feels and the songs of self anguish are incredible...and NO not EVERYONE is a fool for an artist with a guitar...John is completely and utterly talented and has come along way...this is for the people that realize that DMB and SRV won't last forever...sometimes change can be a beutiful thing...this cd is one of the few that you can listen to all the way thru...granted i am a pop kid also, even *NSYNC and Britney can't pull that off (they have great albums...just this is better)...Lifehouse's 2000 album No Name Face suffered a similar fate, great from start to finish...If you dig on John the way a lot of us do check out another nu-kid on the block, Norah Jones...although she is 22 she has mastered a voice that many legends past work thier lives to recieve and maintain....by the by...BUY THIS CD...INCREDIBLE....if all else fails just listen to the lyrics...not many can pull off lyrical content and ear candy...he does
B00000J6AG|5.0|I bought this CD more than a year ago.  I do remember telling my friends that the CD wasn't that good.  But I listened to it again a few days ago and you know what? it's a pretty amazing CD.  Especially for me, every song is an amazing song so it tells me it's not the CD it was me that changed.  Every song, tells me that I have changed.  I guess I didn't \\"play\\" it right back then...
B000056K04|4.0|I love dave matthews band.  All there cd's are great.  This is not what you would normally expect from dave matthews.  It is different.  It is an okay cd with a bunch of good songs but not all.  I think the best song on the cd is definitly DREAMS OF OUR FATHERS its more rock.
B000001H00|5.0|In this double CD, Nathan Milstein, in a recording made rather towards the end of his life, shows his complete mastery and profound understanding of Bach's solo violin work. These are stern yet emotional performances, revealing the beauty and power of Bach as one seldom hears it. Particularly interesting in the Chaccone BWV 1004, which is nowadays more often heard as a guitar transcription, thanks to Segovia. Julian Bream, who made a brilliant recording of the Chaccone for guitar, wrote that one had to be at least 50 years old to do it properly. I agree with his assessment, especially hearing Milstein's stern, almost sorrowful performance. One feels in touch with a more intense world while listening to this recording, a world Bach often reveals through great performances. I can't recommend this recording enough.
B00005UK1F|5.0|By now you may have already run across the acclaim this album is getting and are already itching to get your hands on it.  Allow me to give you the added incentive to hurry and do just that because the raving praise this album has garnered thus far from critics elsewhere is justly deserved.  Now, here is my own breakdown. <BR>GREEN CARNATION's inception into the Metal community was not a good one from my vantage point.  Their first release reeked of directionless confusion and dulled me into the next dimension.  Had I walked away and ignored the band after that first release I would have truly missed out on one of the most majestic Metal releases in, well, decades really.  Light Of Day, Day Of Darkness is quite nearly this decade's answer to PINK FLOYD's The Wall of the1970's.    Not surprisingly that comparison transcends not just the 25 or so years separating those two releases and the obvious genre difference but the atmosphere this album carries with it is at times not too far from that established by PINK FLOYD in their heyday. <br />The album is one track.  That's right - one song.  Well, truthfully its really several songs that have been amalgamated into one but there are several seamless transitions that create the illusion of one long and journeyed composition.  The only problem I had with this is that I can't advance to sections of the song because all cd players will read this as one track at 60 minutes plus.  Not a problem when you consider that you'll be absorbed for the majority of your listen anyway.  This is what makes this release so incredibly good - the sheer captivation of your senses. <br />The album begins with haunting synthesization and the innocent ramblings of a playful child (band leader Tchort's son in fact).  As the slow drumming steps in and the album begins its lengthy journey the mood is immediately set and the emotion begins flowing at once.  Because there are so many differing elements to this album its too time consuming and cumbersome to cover every transition but suffice it to say that the fluidity of this album is startling.  Waves and crests of emotive strings and keys and the backdrop of an enormous ensemble of guest musicians (numbering around 30 or more including a children's choir and opera choir) create an epic and majestic musical portrait of the deepest scope.  While there is heavy emphasis on supportive elements on this album let one not forget that this is a Metal album above all things.  Heavy guitars drive and steer this beast across its many landscapes of emotional depth with the listener riding the steady wave of triumph and tragedy, sorrow and consolation, that the album seems keenly geared toward building.  Its a towering success.  Deep into the album there are some bizarre experiments with female chants, which while adding a very odd and eclectic quality, are perhaps a bit too overbearing in length but they add a chill to your spine and alter the mood once again. <br />Light Of Day, Day Of Darkness is a dark album when you step away from it and view (or hear as it were) it from a perspective of totality.  However, to call this simply Doom Metal is criminal.  This is so much more and genre classification is completely defied.  Allow me to call it Ambient/Doom/Epic/Orchestral Metal.  Actually that doesn't do it justice and its likely you won't be able to label this with anything currently in the Metal subgenre arsenal.  Its just too far out.  GREEN CARNATION have created an album that rocks, that saddens, that nurtures, that gives hope then takes it away, that weeps and then dries the tears with breezes of melody.  I picture this musical tapestry as a succession of hills and valleys with changing weather patterns and an endless horizon.  So yes, its really good see? <br />A few notes.  No death growls, just clean singing and well done too.  If I had to name band's for comparison I couldn't do it save for the aforementioned PINK FLOYD mention and I think if PINK FLOYD were aMetal band this is probably the direction they'd pursue.  I'm tempted to bring OPETH into the equation but not even OPETH have tried anything this bold and artistic to date.  Truly this is just GREEN CARNATION.  And that folks, is brilliant. <br />This is mandatory. That's all - mandatory.  Its also one of the top 5 releases of 2001 and might just go down as one of the top 5 of the past two decades.  Now go get it, bring it home, turn down the lights, listen and dream....
0792101448|5.0|Sometimes a movie is worth watching if for no other reason than to appreciate the performance of an actor. This is one of those except there is not one but three actors. In addition to their performance, Leone himself seems to have been allowed far more artistic license than permitted by Hollywood's quick profit motive today. The best example is the opening scene. Jack Elam is perfect along with Woody Strode. What other movie starts out with a drama between man and fly. And to watch Strode's death scene makes you wonder how often such scenes actually occurred in the old west.<br />Leone frequently put the camera right in the face of his performers. Perhaps he overdid the art of the closeup but you soon accepted it as part of the movie's tone. One of my favorites was of Bronson at the end where he said \\"Someday\\" and walked out the door. Had the scene been longer or shorter I think it would have taken away from the moment. Likewise, the dialogue. To have said anymore would have been too much.<br />Lonesome Dove is another great western tale that leaves you wanting more of the main characters. You wish you could meet not the performers but the characters themselves. Perhaps to an actor that is one of their goals. Only the great ones seem to be able to do it, not the superficial over-rated wannabe's that we are insulted by Hollywood with today. If we allowed the performers to perform as Leone does here, the garbage in Hollywood today would show itself for what it actually is; Untalented for little else than to read lines and follow directions and seek publicity.<br />How wonderful it is to enjoy a movie for the performance more than the story or the special effects.
B00005RYL9|4.0|THE MOVIE ITSELF IS VERY GOOD. THE TRANFER TO DVD IS VERY CLEAR AND SHARP WITH NO VISUAL ARTIFACTS AT ALL. ALSO REMIXING THE SOUNDTRACK WITH DOLBY EX AND DTS IS A REAL PLUS! BOTH SOUND GREAT. THERE DID SEEM TO BE A FEW SCENES ADDED TO THE FEATURE ALSO. DISC ONE ALSO PACKS THREE QUEEN VIDEOS AMD A RUNING COMMENTARY BY THE DIRECTORS WITH THE MOVIE IF YOU CHOOSE THIS OPTION. THER ALSO ARE STILLS AND SCENCE SELECTION OPTIONS.  THEY INCLUDE A CD OF JUST THREE QUEEEN SONGS AND NOT THE REST OF THE SOUNDTRACK. (OR ANY OTHER MUSIC FOR THAT MATTER).WHAT A GREAT WASTE TO PRESS A COMPLETE CD AND ONLY PUT THREE SONGS ON IT.  THE PACKAGE IS ALSO GOOD AND BAD. THE GOOD: THE ENTIRE DISC PACKAGE IS COVERED IN SMALL GAGE BRUSHED ALUMINUM COVER. THE BAD: THE INNER PLASTIC PACKAGE ON MINE BROKE TO PIECES WHEN I OPENED IT THE FIRST TIME. THE PRICE FOR THIS PACKAGE IS JUST TO HIGH.  NOT RECOMMENED AT THIS PRICE.
B00005YXZH|5.0|this album is unspeakably great, my first by wilco by the way. it did take a few listens but it caught after a while, and now i can't stop listening. this album has an entrancing vibe that gets into your head (or mine anyways). i love this thing, and am now trying to get some of their other stuff. i suggest experiencing this, and i hope that it does the same to you as it has to me.
B0000636UN|2.0|There was a day when Sheryl Crow could belt out Rhiannon and Rock On Golden Woman real good or even that freedom song from the white album. I liked her when she recorded the Sunset song. something about being in california if i remember clearly. But now all of a sudden she's putting on ears and leaves her gravelly voice behind. Now she's pretending to be a pop singer, it's just not sounding good at all, in britney style. she used to sing out rock song now she's into Britney style song. and her voice change. i feel betrayed cuz she didn't keep it real.  voices carry from til tuesday was her best album. but that's just my opinion. hope this helps :)
B00005QZ7U|1.0|Horrible movie, worst I've ever seen (and I thought that would always be Prelude to a Kiss.)  So weird, campy. Good acting?? I guess so, if you consider they didn't laugh themselves to death throughout this silly movie.  The music choices made me cringe. The worst thing is, without all the pop music and \\"trying\\" to be funny, the actual STORY would've worked on it's own--it could've been good!  My opinion, don't waste your time.
0792151720|5.0|Titanic (1997) is a 20th century masterpiece. Other than Apollo 13 and Platoon, no other film even comes close. I don't waste my time going to the movies, but I did see Titanic 5 times in the theater. This is one of life's most tragic moments in engineering history. Forget the fictitious love story and bashing of the rich in this film. The accurate special effects and reality of this true story makes it deserving of 11 Academy Awards, with haunting music and an overwhelming ending. Hollywood finally got something right. I highly recommend the widescreen version to capture every detail in the frightful sinking of this real life monster.
B00005JKDR|3.0|Enjoyed it, Pixar is definitely up to snuff in the animation dept. Not nearly as witty as Toy Story or Toy Story 2. I thought Shrek was much better, and that says it all.
B00005NP04|5.0|Martina McBride &amp; Collin Raye are my two favorites, so this cd was an absolute must have for me!  I can't believe Martina didn't have a Greatest Hits album out before now!  This cd is wonderful!  I listen to it in my office every day.  The cd has a great variety of Martina's hits, along with a couple new ones.  My only complaint is that &quot;Born to Give My Love to You&quot; isn't on there!  I personally consider that a &quot;greater hit&quot; than some of the others that made it, but of course she has so many great songs they can't all be on one cd.  5 stars, 2 thumbs up...this is definitely worth buying.
B000002JPA|5.0|\\"Images and Words\\" was the first non-teenybopper album I ever bought. From the cover art and the way the boys on the back looked (all dolled up), I thought it would be a science-fiction version of N Sync. Boy, was I wrong! First you start off with \\"Pull Me Under\\", a shred-heavy tune with a sing-along chorus. The lyrics tell the story of Shakspeare's Hamlet- pretty brainy for a boy band, ain't it? Some other highlights of this album include...\\"Metropolis Part 1\\", which reminds me of anime. There's also a song called \\"Learning to Live\\", which is about AIDS. But the tune with the best groove is definitely \\"Take the Time\\". It's upbeat and a bit urban-styled, so anyone who likes to dance will like it. However, there are also songs that are... well... bland. They are Another Day and Surrounded. Another Day sounds like what any other boyband would produce- an early Backstreet Boys style ballad, with a hairbandy feel. Surrounded sounds a bit like Blink 182 and Nsync mixed together. So get this album today, if you haven't. It will make you a prog addict!
B0000009SF|5.0|boy, when I get tired of hearing what passes for music in 2002, I put on this CD, real musicians playing real music, it's light years ahead of anything else out there. If you think Zappa is just novelty songs then you don't know what you're talking about. Listen to this or Waka/Jawaka or Hot Rats and then talk to me about Zappa. Bands will be playing this music 200 years from now, this is the classical music of the future, everything else is garbage
B000000NN4|5.0|If you like spacey music, you will like this album. Not spacey as in stupid stuff like Yanni, but about outer space. Albedo 0.39 is a concept album about the Milky Way galaxy, describing all sorts of objects such as pulsars, moons, the Main Sequence (which means the very bright stars that march across the middle of the galaxy), the birth of a star (Nucleogenesis) and Earth (Albedo 0.39). Some of the songs are upbeat, like the exciting technoish Pulsar, the Mahavishnu Orchestra-styled Main Sequence, and definitely the cool two-part epic Nucleogenesis, which sounds like Keith Emerson at his best! If you listen to the title track, Albedo 0.39, you will not only hear mystical ambient music, but you will learn all the facts about our planet Earth, which has an albedo (percent of light reflected) of 0.39. <BR>I checked the facts with my science teacher back in seventh grade and they were accurate. So buy it today!
B00005OWEG|5.0|One of the most extraordinary misjudgements of cinematic history was to award the 'Best Film' Oscar of 79/80, not to APOCALYPSE NOW, but to KRAMER VS. KRAMER.  As many have said, Apocalypse is not just one of the greatest war movies of all time, it is one of the greatest of all movies, and has stood the test of the past 23 years very well.  If nothing else, you can enjoy it as a marvellous druggy trip through fantastic cinematography and music.<br />I believe Coppola was absolutely right in releasing the 'short' version back in 1979.  Many cinematic audiences just wouldn't have had the patience for the long and drawn-out dialogues with Brando.  The French plantation scenes would have just seemed out of place to many.<br />But I am very grateful to Coppola for re-working the whole movie 20 years on.  If nothing else, the sound and picture quality are outstanding.  The film has even more grandeur than the original.  The DVD comes with very few extras -- I'd really like to have had the HEARTS OF DARKNESS making-of documentary included -- but I can cope without them.  This new version has rather more breasts in it than the original, and I suppose several of them can be justified.  The scene where the French widow prepares the mosquito nets around the four-poster is very sensuous!  The only downer arises some of the music that Carmine/Francis Coppola added to the movie -- the love theme is truly dire.<br />Still, this DVD, like the original, is a must-have.  In fact, if you only get one version, get this one.
B00005MAM2|5.0|I won this baby at an auction and I have to say that I'm damn impressed. The transfer from the old film to this remastered and enhanced DVD is absolutely stunning. I've seen Akira many times before in a VCD copy, but seeing it restored in DVD is like watching a whole new Anime. The new voice-overs are good, but sometimes you'll wonder if that is Anakin Skywalker (Jake Lloyd) dubbing some of the voices (there are dull and over-acting moments in the English Dub) - I suggest watching it in it's original Japanese Dub with the subtitles - nothing really beats the Jap language - it captures the character's emotions perfectly!<br />The 2nd Disc is jam-packed with extras. I wish they had the entire page run of the Akira comics in the DVD though... it would be a great read.<br />All in all, this is perfect. There are times that I wish they popped in a booklet of some sort (like the Starting a Fight manual in the Fight Club DVD) - it's also nice to see the characters in something printed.
B000002JAX|5.0|Like a lot of folks who have written reviews here I wanted to see if Ms. Peyroux had perhaps released another album since her stunning &quot;Dreamland.&quot; Looks like she hasn't, which is a shame. What a wonderful recording!<br />By the way, Madeleine Peyroux sings one song (&quot;Wee small hours of the dawn&quot;) on the soundtrack to the movie &quot;Still Breathing&quot; which I highly recommend too. Lots of excellent music there - check it out.
B00000J6AG|5.0|Play is probably the best album I've ever heard in my life, though I admit I wasn't too happy about the song Honey when I first heard it. The brilliance falls into place when you realise that the looping vocals and the background pianos aren't done in the same studio all at once. Find My Baby is okay. <br />Arguably the best songs on the album are Porcelain (one of the most beautiful songs I've ever heard), South Side (ditto, but only for the Gwen Stefani version), Everloving (a three minute instrumental piece that blew me off), and My Weakness (which sounds like a group of children singing). <br />Creating your own music is good, but remastering other's into a masterpiece is better.

6304167660|4.0|This is one of the most fun and interesting films I've seen in recent years. Fun, yet not without its serious side. The cast is great, with Timothy Hutton, Matt Dillon, Lauren Holly, Annabeth Gish, and Uma Thurman portraying classic characters in their late twenties. Natalie Portman nearly steals the show as a precotious 13-year-old, who sets her heart on Timothy Hutton.<br />We all know people (friends) like these characters. They ring true to our life experience. I think all guys struggle with the issues these guys are struggling with. (Maybe its true for women and the female characters as well?) <br />Do you look back to your past with longing for what could have been, or forge ahead into the future with whatever it brings?<BR>Do you cling to the wild and independent spirit of your youth, or settle down into &quot;commited&quot; and maturing relationships?<br />Throw in a bar fight, some car crashes (all excused as raging male hormones), and you have a mix that could result in disaster (movie-wise), but director Ted Demme keeps it all together, and with just the right level of finese, comes up with a film that works, and works well!
B00005B36H|5.0|Lateralus is amazing. Astounding. Simply the best music I've ever heard (until now). Ænima was incredible and was the album that convinced me that Tool was the greatest band ever, but Lateralus takes it even further. Long and complex, this is unlike anything that you will ever hear on the radio or TV. Sure, I still like many popular bands, but this is a perfect album. Each song is very long which is a huge plus- listen to them and concentrate on the music. It puts me into a long trance. This is the opposite of radio or TV-friendly and Tool does not care. Check out their new video for Parabola- it's over 10 minutes long! I don't know if MTV would ever play the entire thing. And the video is for the entire song (Parabol,Parabola), too. I love it.<br />There is some real talent at work here too. I think the bass on \\"Schism\\" speaks for itself, but excellent vocals, guitar, drums, and bass are found all throughout.<br />The high point is the whole last half of the album (I am absolutely NOT saying anything bad about the first half). \\"Ticks and Leeches\\" is the heaviest track on the album, and it also contains one of the lightest parts. That's what makes it brilliant- the song starts off strong, and then everythings quiet, with a nice little guitar sound among other quiet noises. And then....... WHAM! The song goes all-out until the end. \\"Lateralus\\" is probably my favorite song. Very complicated, too. Read some interviews with the band about this song and you'll see what I mean. Complex time signatures, 987, and the Fibbonacci sequence... you have to read about it. It all comes together to make an amazing 9-minute monster of a song with an awesome ending. And then there's the 23-minute marathon, \\"Disposition\\", \\"Reflection\\", and \\"Triad\\". These songs are meant to be listened to together. \\"Disposition\\" is a haunting little melody that leads perfectly into \\"Reflection\\". This is one of the most interesting songs on the album. It starts off with a very odd rhythm until about 7:00 in, when it goes into heavier guitar, excellent solos, and different sounds. And when Reflection slowly \\"pines\\" away (I couldn't help myself), \\"Triad\\" slowly comes in. The last real song, this is an awesome instrumental of heavy guitars and cool beats. And when \\"Triad\\" is done, silence. Out of nowhere, \\"Faaip de Oaid\\" pops up and literally chills your bones. An awesome way to end.<br />If you like rock/metal and you seriously think you really appreciate music, I do not understand how you could not like this album. This isn't \\"push play and let's rock\\" music, but if you take the time to appreciate music, this is a good thing. If you like rock/metal and you think the songs are too long and boring, then you are impatient and you do not fully appreciate music.
6303443214|5.0|i read the book and loved it. then i decided to see the movie. i love the movie as well, though i think the book is a little better :) What i like about Rice's vampire characters is that they have humanlike feelings and emotions, and are more than just cold, unemotional killing machines that vampires are sometimes depicted as. Overall, it is an interesting, mesmerizing tale that mostly stays true to the book. Cruise, Pitt, Dunst, and Banderas did a great job playing their characters, it was just the way i imagined them when i was reading the book! They also looked very realistic as vampires. The best done scene(in my opinion) was young Claudia's transformation into a vampire. You should definitely see this movie if you are a fan of vampires, or just movies in general.
B0000640SA|5.0|Or is it '13 Monkeys'?<br />Yes, for sure - this mindbender of a movie [it's SO much more] pushes you face-first into the mind of the afflicted, and the fun of it is - after the initial viewing - to see if you can recall all of this ...... in sequence...... AND just where are you at the end?<br />Hmmmmm....<br />GUY PEARCE [an Award - winning performance] shines as the befuddled hero searching for his wife's killer [s]; Joe Pantoliano as the 'helper' could just be an alter ego? Carrie-Anne Moss - picture perfect as the Barmaid - yes? AND??<br />It must have been sheer hell in the editing room! BUT the end product is stunning roaming endlessly over those blah motel rooms in LA'a 'valley', and the scum bars, and those confusing intersections and roadways back here. WOULDN'T be surprised if Mulholland Drive's limo passes by.......empty...<br />Mr. Pearce is possibly the best import from OZ since Flynn. A great leading man - and a career worth watching!<br />Kudo's to the non-distracting costume and art directing - perfect.<br />For more fun? \\"Mirage\\", \\"The Passenger\\", \\"Last Year at Marienbad\\", \\"The Cabinet of Dr. Caligari\\", \\"Providence\\", etc.
B0000630BT|5.0|After the disasters otherwise known as Turbo and Ram It Down, nobody expected Judas Priest to ever again be a force in metal. However, Priest responded with a deafening wall of sound that has become a classic. First and foremost, the addition of Scott Travis is what really made this album. After years of listening to Dave Holland and then his 'replacement', the drum machine, Travis's sheer energy made songs like Painkiller into classics. Only real weak tracks here are Hell Patrol and Leather Rebel, but all the rest are nothingt short of great. Highly recommended.
B00005JKED|3.0|I don't know why this movie got as good reviews as it did. This movie was good but it wasn't great.
B00003W8NM|5.0|If you liked David Fincher's Se7en as much as I did (and I liked it a lot), then you will be able to experience these emotions again when you view this wonderfully chaotic masterpiece: Fight Club.  Again he continues with witty social commentary, chewing and spitting out the middle class urban and suburban lifestyles.<BR>If you don't like Fight Club, try watching it again, and rather than preparing for the escapism that accompanies most films, start thinking when play is pressed.  Join the protagonist in questioning, in dissecting life as we know it..<BR>For some people, Fight Club is a paradigm-shifter, and you'll never be able to forget it.  For others, like myself, Fincher and Chuck Palaniuk combine to reinforce my beliefs in a most astounding way.  Fight Club is, &quot;Dark, Silent and Complete,&quot; --Edward Norton.<br />Cheers.
6304539258|5.0|Star Wars is not only a great movie, but its a terrific movie to watch over and over again.  The special effects are outstanding , the story never gets old, and the characters are very 3-D and easy to relate to.  The acting is first-rate, and this is the movie that made Harrison Ford well known.  Most people know the story so I won't go into that.<BR>       This is just one of those movies you have to buy!
0380789019|5.0|Another Gaiman gem. I actually felt sad as I got towards the end of the story, since I wanted to continue knowing these people in this place. Neverwhere is the underground below the London Underground, among things. It's also a place deep in your mind as you read this. Amazing.
B00003CXI1|4.0|Okay, many of you will be saying that the movie did not translate well from the book.  My 12 yr old daughter would probably agree. But when one analyses it, it would have been impossible to incorporate so much from the book into the movie and keep it to a reasonable length. This must have been a huge dilemma for the directors and producers, \\"what to put in the movie\\". When one accepts this and focuses on the content of the movie, I don't think you can help but be pretty impressed with it.  Bringing to life Harry Potter and his world was accomplished very well in my opinion. I found the movie atmospheric and I was drawn into his world.  This to me is the mark of a good movie.  I loved the settings and the overall colour of the movie.  I thought the acting was okay, nothing to rave about, but adequate.  I have seen the movie twice with my kids and I enjoyed it both times.  I have a small collection of DVD's and I'm quite discerning about what I buy.  This DVD will be joining the collection.
B00003CXXP|2.0|I was looking forward to this film. It seemed like it had a great deal of potenitial. But in the end it is just so much of the same material done again and again and again. Let's face it even Star Trek has done the moral aspect of androids with Data and even had comments relating to that little wooden boy.<BR>   There is just nothing new at all in this film. Spielberg tries to convince us how imaginative this film is. But it isn't. Just rehashed old material put in a sci-fi setting. And not a very believeable one at that. <BR>   A small bottle of perfume is considered irreplaceable yet some of the meals the people consume are large, and they made reference to food being a limited resource. Fooey.<BR>   It really could have been something good. But just fails. It gets 1 star for special effects were are quite good and 1 star for the robot boy david. If he had played Anakin Skywalker then not only would it have been a better film, but it may even have been believeable that the boy would become Vader.<br />   Give this one a miss. It is all hype and all talk. They didn't want to give anything away because they knew it was old material. Save your money, watch bicentenial man or read I, Robot.
B00005Q66T|4.0|I have not bought it yet.... know it will be good when i do though.
0805066691|3.0|I think that this is a very important book in that documents the history of the native americans in the US. It is heartbreaking to read the same story over and over of broken promises and treaties that lead to the destruction of various indian tribes. But as far as reading goes it does get a little repetitious as each tribe has almost the same story of betrayal. Would have liked to known a little more about some of the leaders of the tribes.
6300214559|4.0|I do not know much about the Tudor history.  What made this movie exciting to me was Lady Jane's staunch Anglican faith.  By watching this film I learned some of the crucial differences between the Catholic faith and the Episcopal (Anglican) faith. <BR>For someone so young she showed great faith which I greatly admire.  She was truly a martyr for her religion.
B00005YXZH|5.0|Wilco has proven that it doesn't take one specific sound for a band to remain loyal to their fans or to please the only people that matter to them: THEIR FANS.  This is the greatest CD ever made in my opinion from the dream-like opening of &quot;I'm Trying To Break Your Heart&quot; to the extremely depressing end in &quot;Reservations&quot;.  Anyone that likes something new and fresh should pick up this album.  As for comparisons to Radiohead (a.k.a. the MOST overrated band EVER)this album blows them out of the water in every way, shape, and form.  If you appreciate ANY creative genius that doesn't have the MTV look and conformity style, then you will LOVE this album.
B00005JKL8|5.0|Didn't see in the movies. But got the DVD and was blown away. Loved it! Great Flick. Lots of action.
B00003CX5P|5.0|I'll be the first to admit that I wasn't too impressed with The Phantom Menace upon first release. The plot seemed to have no relation to Episodes IV-VI, Jar Jar was annoying, and Obi-Wan didn't look or sound like, well, Obi-Wan.<br />Well, Episode II changed most of that.<br />Looking back at The Phantom Menace, it truely is not that different from Episodes IV-VI. Sure, the technology is better, and the budget is bigger, but it's in the same vein as IV-VI.<br />This DVD has set a high bar for the five following it to reach. The video and sound quality is excellent. The extras are par none. The commentaries provide interesting information, unlike many others. And the deleted scenes allow us to see what the Special Edition of Episode I will probably look like if Lucas is alive in 2019.<br />I only have one minor complaint: there were some other deleted scenes, even very small trims that would have required little/no effort to finish, that were left out, one of which (the &quot;swamp + active lightsaber = dead lightsaber&quot; snippet) is needed to make the Obi-Wan-chased-by-STAPs scene make sense.<br />All in all, definately worth the money.
B000002GQK|5.0|When i first listened to this i was shocked. Was this really the Moody Blues? the next day however i listened to it again, and found it wasn't as bad as i'd made it out to be. I bought it because it has my all time favorite Moody Blues song on it , The Story in Your Eyes. It starts of kind of..strange. Procession kind of takes us through a history of music. The story in Your Eyes is a heavier song(in comparison to thier other songs). Our Guessing Game isn't bad. Ditto for Emily's Song. Then comes After You Came, which is also heavy for them, but very good. One more time to Live also goes through a music history. Nice to Be Here is an average Ray Thomas song, upbeat and rather foolish. You Can Never Go Home is another of my favorites. The final song on this album, My Song, is getting back to the usual, tried and true Moody Blues. The change on this album is nice, but I still like the calm,serene Moody Blues.
B0000633T6|4.0|I thought this was a thinking persons movie.  If you're looking for action, don't look here.  But if an intellectual movie is your cup of tea, by all means check this one out.  By the way I have the wide screen version not the full screen as indicated earlier.
B00004TH83|4.0|From the moment you hear Lara Fabians voice you will fall in love with her. Her voice is so beautiful and powerful that it will make the hairs on the back of your neck stand up. Her debut english album contains the smash hit I Will Love Again, one of the few songs this year that I cranked up whenever it came on the radio. Unfortunatlty there are no other dance songs like this on the album. The majority of the album are ballads, and midtempo songs that seem fit for the Celine Dion crowd. Her voice is reminiscent of Celines, but Lara got soul and emotion behind her voice. The most stunning ballad here is Adagio. A powerhouse vocal performance that will leave you speechless. You Are My Heart, Broken Vow, To Love Again, and Love By Grace are just a few of the highlights of this album. Her voice is probably one of the best in music today.
B00005RDAF|4.0|\\"Britney:The Videos\\" was Miss. Spears' third official DVD/video. Unlike her previous releases, this one is named after her third disc \\"Britney\\". While it follows her songs and commercial from the album, it also comtains the music video \\"Don't Let Me Be The Last To Know\\", from her sophomore release. It also includes a behind-the-scenes from her movie \\"Crossroads\\". The only bad thing about this DVD is that it is only like 30 minutes, whereas her previous ones were more close to a full hour at least. And also, there is nothing in here that you can't see on TV. However, that doesn't matter if you are a Brit fan, and if you are, this is for you.
B00003CWL6|5.0|The bottom line is: This movie is about everyday for MOST people.  That's the irony of it.  Hence, the movie's catch phrase - \\"Look closer\\".  Obviously, some people can't seem to look any closer than what they immediate see at the surface, so they don't understand.  And not understand is the start of belligerence and negativity.  The thing that was innovative about this was the positive message it was trying to send to everyone who watched it, \\"Do what makes you happy.  There is always enough time left in your life.  There is always a chance.\\"  Kevin Spacey quit his job, in which he was a silent tool used for years, and he did it in a way where he still had a year's worth of pay.  It's realistic that he didn't immediately run out of money.  And to whomever thinks the point of this movie was to say something along the lines of \\"Teens are deep.  Adults are shallow\\" was severely mistaken.  The movie was about realization.  The realization that life is beautiful and that life is such a gift, so why waste it on trivial [stuff]?  Do what you feel, whatever makes you happy.  LOOK CLOSER.  I see know why they adopted that catch phrase for the movie, BECAUSE SOME PEOPLE DON'T KNOW HOW TO LOOK CLOSER.  So they miss the message of the movie and completely [ruined] it.  It's just so sad.  People miss the message.  But to those of you, who actually got the message, if you still didn't like it then...that is your own opinion and you're entitled to it.<BR>I feel the movie is about life and how there's always a chance to change it, to be who you feel.  That's why it's such a great movie.
B00005R5G9|5.0|WOW, one of those rare finds from the 80's A true romance commedy with all the right stars protrayed here. Keeps your attention the whole way through.  Very confused on the few people who rated this movie so low, are they jeleous?, that there lives are so boring or something, that they have to knock down such a classic as this gem of a movie?
B00005QEO2|5.0|This two cd set has almost all of this fantastic band's great songs. It really is a must have for any Aerosmith fan. Even if you own every Aerosmith album, you have to get this if only for the last four songs. The end of the second CD contains four jems, live versions of \\"Fallin' in Love ..., Dream On, Hole in My Soul\\" and \\"Sweet Emotion\\". The entire CD is great, but these four are the high points. The end of the first Cd contains the version of Walk this Way with Run/DMC. Together with AEROSMITH'S GREATEST HITS, one can get most of their great songs.
B00003CX6P|1.0|First of all, I let me just tell you that I did NOT like this film.  It was tedious.  Matt Damon did a good job with his role as did most of the actors in this film but that didn't save it.  The plot was apparently based on the concept of boring the audience to tears and in that respect it suceeded.  I went with a large group of people and only one person liked the film.  Also, as we were leaving the theatre, everyone was complaining that they sat through this.  Rent it first and if you actually see something that I didn't, then buy.
6305132984|5.0|I first saw this movie in my English class after we finished reading \\"Romeo and Juliet\\". My first thought was \\"Oh, great, this is gonna be so stupid!\\" But after the first scene, it completely captured me. Natalie Wood was definitely the best choice for Maria. Her performance in \\"I Feel Pretty\\" is stunning. Richard Beymer's performance as Tony is truely heartbreaking, especially in his dying scene.<br />The music is far better than any other musical movie. My favorite songs are \\"Maria\\", \\"Tonight\\", and \\"Somewhere\\". I was on the verge of bursting into tears in the last scene where Maria sings part of \\"Somewhere\\" as Tony dies in her arms. This movie is truly a masterpiece that will last for generations to come. \\"West Side Story\\" will definitely capture your heart as it did mine.
B000060MY6|4.0|If ever a storyteller was irresistibly drawn toward the cinema and its camera's all-seeing eye, that person would be David Lynch.  \\"Mulholland Drive\\" uses the camera as an omniscient eye into the world of Hollywood filmmaking, utilizing the talents of three remarkable performers, Laura Elena Harring, Naomi Watts and Justin Theroux.<br />The film begins with Harring helplessly wandering the streets of Hollywood after a collision occurs on Mulholland Drive with the limousine in which she was riding, causing an explosion, after which she barely escapes with her life.  Lynch shrewdly uses the magnificent contours of Harring's face, accenting her perfectly sloped cheekbones, to achieve maximum benefit from a purposeful camera.  Laura Elena was the first Hispanic ever to win the Miss U.S.A. contest, after which she became a countess by marrying into the prominent Bismarck family.  At that point she began studying drama in London.  Her marriage ended and she pursued her film career vigorously, with Lynch providing her with a solid breakthrough performance.<br />Harring interacts in the film with the lovely blonde actress who won Breakthrough Performance of the Year honors from the National Film Board of Review resulting from her sterling effort in \\"Mulholland Drive.\\"  Naomi Watts was born in England and raised in Australia.  After a decade of fervent effort to build a film career Lynch provided her with this solid break, with which she made good.  When Harring, unable to remember anything, occupies Watts' apartment shortly before her arrival by plane from Canada, the understanding young blonde woman immediately befriends her, inviting her to move in with her.  Watts, whose aunt, a famous actress, is the apartment's occupant, and is letting her use it while she is making a film in Canada, immediately assists Harring in seeking to uncover the mystery associated with her memory loss.<br />In the manner of Lynch, the film develops into a series of dramatic situations in whichthe viewer is confronted with the task of separating a dreamworld of illusion from reality.  As the film develops we learn that Watts and Harring are vying for the same starring role in a major film.<br />Justin Theroux enters the mix as a confused director.  Lynch is to be credited for never depicting Theroux as a raving lunatic, but rather someone who launches into bizarre behavior in a low key manner, rendering the character more uniquely effective.  Theroux remains outwardly calm no matter what happens, even after he is forcibly thrown out of his own Hollywood canyon home by the pool cleaner he finds in bed with his wife.<br />By the film's end Harring is enchanting everyone, male and female.  At one point Watts becomes jealous over her attention, along with her competition for a role she wants in the film Theroux is directing.  Theroux has been warned by the gangster element financially backing the film that he is duty bound to put Watts in the starring female role, leading to conflict.<br />One of the film's zaniest characters is a professional hit man with the efficiency level of Inspector Clousseau at his daffiest.  He is compelled to eliminate large numbers of people to cover up his staggering inefficiency.<br />Playing the role of the shrewd \\"You can't fool me\\" landlady of the apartment building where Watts and Harring stay is veteran Ann Miller, who starred in MGM musicals in the fifties.  She immediately sees through the flimsy explanation provided by Watts to justify Harring staying with her.  At one point the relationship between the two beautiful young women heats up into an erotic love sequence captured beautifully by Lynch's all-seeing camera.
B000055X3U|5.0|I own almost all of Anathema's collection...and I must say that this album is the best.  I don't have A Fine Day to Exit yet, but Judgement has to take the cake.  If you've ever had an album reach inside you and pull out something that maybe you did or didn't want exposed, this will do it.  Whether it makes you happy or depressed, this album does it.  But either way, you end up loving every minute of it.  The solo on One Last Goodbye has to be the most heartfelt and emotional solos I've ever heard...you can literally FEEL his pain, as he shifts it to the listener.  Tears will well up in your eyes, and the next thing you know, you're wrapped up in it.  This band started out as just another doom metal band when almost everything was doom metal.  It seems that My Dying Bride and Anathema are the only true leaders in this genre...the new MDB is amazing too.  There has never been another band that has moved me to tears...EVER!  Take the emotional solo in Metallica's Orion and multiply it by a thousand, then you might come close.  \\"Judgement\\" has a really doomy feel to it, not musically but emotionally.  It feels like a man whose anger starts very small, then builds and builds until it explodes.  GREAT dynamics in the song, very well put together.  \\"All the horror you create, it'll bring you to your knees.\\"  Then everything starts to come full circle, and you're stomping your foot and shaking your head as you pick up on it.  The biggest thing with Judgement is the tempo as it builds, you feel engulfed in it and you can't control yourself.  It's everything you've ever wanted to tell someone you could never get closure with, whether it be an ex, a childhood encounter, etc.  One Last Goodbye is everything you've ever wanted to tell the person you loved, but know you could never have and it would never work out.  That's the song that hits everyone in the gut...because it's the one that hits home the most.  Anathema has always been amazingly able to suck the listener in to their world and make you feel what they are feeling.  Not many bands are able to do that lately.
B000002GQE|5.0|Before i really start my review i'd like to say that this is not my favorite Moody Blues album. Now I'm sure some people will  read this and say \\"how can this not be his favorite\\". Well i'll explain. It is good, but they have better like To Our Children's Children's Children. As I said, it's very good and does have it's high points. My favorites are Tuesday Afternoon or Forever Afternoon or whatever the song's real name is, Twilight Time and The Sunset. Before anyone threatens me it is worth mentioning I do think Nights in White Satin is a wonderful song, I've just heard it so many times on the radio and in various places. If you want to start a Moody Blues collection, this is a good place to start, but if you don't like this don't give up on the band.
B00004XOWM|5.0|When I first heard this CD in our school cefeteria, I loved it.  It is way better uncensored because you can hear everything, not just a bunch of blank spots. This really is a must-hear CD.  Also check out Significant Other and 3 Dollar Bill Yall'.
6304907648|4.0|Copycat is one of the better thrillers of recent years, directed by John Amiel, who gave us Sommersby and The Man who Knew Too Little (!) Here Sigourney Weaver is criminal psychologist Helen Hudson, who gets attacked by the infamous criminal Daryll Lee Cullum (Harry Connick Jr) and subsequently becomes a paranoid housebound novel writer. Holly Hunter is a cop trying to hunt down a serial killer who is copying the murders of notorious serial killers of the 70's and 80's.<br />The film has some really creepy moments involving the copycat killer's modus operandi, and Weaver is in great form as the paranoid Doc. And Harry Connick Jr is brilliant, playing the role of a psycho with menace and delightfully insane relish. However the film is silly, and sometimes predictable, but it's good points make this one an enthralling film that was unfairly compared to the (admittedly superior) Silence of the Lambs (1991). What it lacks in originality, it makes up for with some really effective shocks and building up to an all-out, gripping finale. Be warned, this film is not for the faint-hearted.
B00004Z459|5.0|I caught my first glimpse of Linkin Park watching MTVX.  I bought it on a chance since I really liked their videos.  What can I say other than I have NOT been disapointed!  They're an incredibly talented band and I hope they have a long career in the music industry!<br />My 10 year old son is constantly stealing this cd from me and I have to go digging through his room to get it back.  He loves it as much as I do!<br />What are you waiting for...pick this up today!
0451191153|1.0|I read Atlas Shrugged a long time ago and thought it awful.  Just to be sure, I read The Fountainhead awhile after and sure enough it was awful too.  It was inconceivable to me that anyone would mistake this woman for a writer or philosopher or even someone you would want to have any more to do with than an unexpected swallow of sour milk.  So now, 40 years later I find she is on lists of &quot;classic&quot; authors, and even a US postage stamp. Oh God, spare me.  I only hope that those who proclaim her magnificance have never read Faulkner, Hemingway, Cormac McCarthy, or even Steven King.
6305622914|5.0|A fabulous performance by versatile Scottish actor Robert Carlyle (\\"Angela's Ashes\\" and \\"Trainspotting\\") is accompanied by a chubbier Mark Addy (Fred Flintstone in \\"The Flintstones in Viva Rock Vegas\\",) Tom Wilkinson (\\"The Patriot\\" and soon, \\"The Importance of Being Earnest\\") and three others to complete the funniest sextet of actors you are likely to see in some time. They set out to do \\"The Full Monty,\\" i.e. strip down to bare bottom for the women of the formerly prosperous Steel-City of Sheffield, as a means of making some money to live through unemployment. Packed with humor and human nature, \\"The Full Monty\\" takes you through the preparation of this odd team of former steel workers to do a full striptease, an act they have top pull together in less than two weeks. I bet you will want to add it to your video collection.
B00005221L|4.0|Before Die Hard, John McTiernan helmed this action plus gore fest starring Ah-Nold Schwarzenegger as Major Alan 'Dutch' Schaefer, on a mission with a bunch of hulky army guys to kill an invisible alien. One of the big man's best films, with great action, a creepy musical score and Stan Winston's excellent alien. However it still succumbs to the formulaic \\"kill everyone but the main guy\\" ending. And plausibility as well as subtlety are nowhere to be seen. But who cares? The action ante is great, and McTiernan's talent for over-the top action can be seen very clearly here. This is great brainless entertainment. The DVD is a real letdown though, with only a trailer. Boo!
0679735909|5.0|I took out Possession twice from the library. I couldn't finish it the first time... it was so DENSE. (A very common reaction, I've since learned, when reading Possession.) But after you get over a particular section involving very long-winded letters between two Victorian poets, the story goes reeling and I ended up in tears near the end... I can still quote from the letter Christabel LaMotte wrote to Ash, a letter that never reached him.<br />Hell. Who DOESN'T want to have loved somebody that much?<br />I don't think many critics have mentioned this, but to me, the supporting characters really MAKE the book. I was touched by Byatt's knowing yet sympathetic portrayal of Ellen Ash, who very secretly wished to be a poet but became the lantern bearer for one instead, or of Dr. Beatrice Nest, a mild literary scholar working on \\"womanly work\\" when she really wants to sink her teeth into what truly makes her tick, the painter Blanche Glover and her descriptions of light and the depiction of force (the complete text of her suicide note is given at one point)... there's a very, very moving passage around the end of the book where Ellen sifts through the remains of Ash's things and decides what to do with Christabel's letter.<br />For the aspiring writers out there, there's an important passage on words around the end where Roland suddenly discover's he's a poet and the poems \\"fall like rain.\\" I know everyone hates the poems but they are really worth reading and thinking about; if you like Emily Dickinson you'll love Christabel's poems. I hope Byatt has the full text of \\"Ask and Embla\\" somewhere.<br />The best thing about Possession is that it understands people who think literature MEANS something beyond being a lovely way to kill time. It understands those quiet but passionate people you see browsing in bookstores, who write reviews on Amazon.com, who, at a used bookstore, find joy in finding an out-of-print-book they've been DYING to read for years. It's a book that understands YOU.
0446310786|5.0|one thing to the person who called this one of the worst books he/she has ever read.. simply because the novel centers around an 8 year old does not mean the prose is infantile.. and in many ways, i'm sure a story told by an 8 year old would be better than a story told by this reviewer. the book is far from repetitive, and if the reviewer believes that this is another case of a bad book being held up as a classic, i suggest that that person go back to school and find out what a classic really is. how dare this person criticize classics when he/she obviously has no idea of what that word means. perhaps spending more time in the library and spending more time actually READING books and finding the depth in them would help.
B000002NFM|5.0|Flat out good tunes.  Great for cruising around town or just cruising the net.  Upbeat and very energetic.  'Nuff said.
B00005K3LU|5.0|The movie that made John McTiernan (Predator) the hottest action director in Hollywood, created an explosion of inferior rip-offs and with Bruce Willis, started the long line of sweaty vested heroes while making a huge box-office success.<br />The movie of course, is Die Hard. The first (and best) in what would become a trilogy, Bruce Willis' first major action man role carries the distinction of being heralded as the greatest action movie ever made. It's title is debatable, but regardless, this movie is great! The action, stunts, uber-cool villains, one-liners, impressive FX and big noisy things exploding make this one of the all-time greats. McTiernan would go on to direct Die Hard with a Vengeance after Renny Harlin's mediocre Die Hard 2 and influenced countless other action films throughout the 80's and 90's.<br />This special edition DVD is one of the best on the market, loaded with extras.<br />Disc 1 includes a commentary by director John McTiernan and production designer Jackson DeGovia, and Disc 2 has outtakes, deleted scenes, the whole flippin' screenplay, awesome trailers, TV spots and DVD-ROM features with script-to-screen comparison and game demos and more cool stuff for die-hard Die Hard fans (Hey, that's where the saying comes from!) See? This movie has truly influenced countless action films but has also become a statement for all things sweaty and extreme. Yipee Kay Yay!
B000003S0I|5.0|No subsequent studio release could stand up to Crimso's original, until this one.  Alongside several other &quot;progressive&quot; bands working at the time, this album helped to reshape the dimensions of rock.  Any further aggrandizement of the details and particulars of this album are irrelevant.  The music speaks entirely too well for itself.  If you're interested in King Crimson, and/or the sounds they pioneered, do yourself a favor and secure this disc.
0060977493|5.0|This is one of the most amazing books I have ever read. The best description for it is &quot;as subtle as it is powerful&quot;. I find this to be a book a woman would enjoy more than a man. This is one of the most high brow books I have ever read. Its a sad story written in the most beautiful language. I highly recommend it.
6305922756|4.0|Yes it was funny and yes the songs made me laugh. If you rent this you will be happy. Workin' on a ... farm!
B00000G09Q|2.0|This movie marked the end of \\"Turtle Mania\\" and by the time the movie came out, the Ninja Turtles were on their way out.  But, I will always like the Ninja Turtles.  They were the bomb.<br />  The third and final turtle movie isn't as good as the first two, but its worth watching at least once.
B00005OAIE|4.0|This is a solid album, with three or four stand out songs that make it worth buying. The songs \\"Neon\\", \\"No Such Thing\\", \\"3*5\\", and \\"Love Song to No-one\\" are very good. Listen to those, if you like them buy, if you dont, this isnt for you.
6305426694|4.0|You know the old saying that courtroom movies are supposed to be boring right.Well forget that and enjoy this one which deals with a story that was worth telling.The story ressembles ERIN BROKOVICH in many aspects:it is about humans and the way a irresponsable corporation can cause deaths just because the job wasn't done right.ROBERT DUVALL in a supporting role steals the show,but JOHN TRAVOLTA is also well cast.You'll laugh when you'll see him get two speed contaventions in a row.You'll also understand while viewing this,why justice is a game that can get as far as morgatging your house as a guarantee for handling the debts of a trial.I'd rather see ten films like this rather than one mindless science-fiction techno action bore ,complete with heavy-metal music.
0425163407|5.0|this was the first Kay Scarpetta book i ever read. It is what got me hooked. Since then, i have read better ones, and worse ones. But none of them have been bad. <br />This is another great one. The plot is nicely original, fast paced, and punchy. The writing is the same. (I love her writing)<br />Kay is back, and her usual superwoman self. Lucy too is back, but here seems far more human and likeable than in some of the other books. (but hey, i still like ger a great deal. i dont know what most people's problem is with her.)<br />Theres some more good forensic detail (although often she needs to explain things just a tad more) which adds dimension to the book, and even more interest. <br />really, theres not a lot i can say about this book, apart from repeating things that i have said about all her others, which i cant really be bothered to do. Rest assured, though, that here again Patricia Cornwell has produced another excellent forensic thriller that is easy to read, with a superb writing style. Highly reccomended. (As are all her books.)
B00005JKBC|1.0|I hated that the captioning would not stay off.  I ordered FOUR copies with the same results.  I did return the copies.  However, the movie is good, I just wish I wasn't distracted by the words.
B00005QZWI|5.0|The Lord of the Rings Sountrack utilizes some of the most beautiful instrumental combinations I have heard. Track Two, the theme of the Shire is one particular such track. The flute/fiddle combination along with the rest of the orchestra always has a calming and relaxing effect on me. Also, throughout the sountrack, Howard Shore uses vocals to emphasise various points. Many vocals are used in the tracks involving the Ringwraeths (sorry about the spelling there) and some Elven singing in other tracks which, while I usually find vocals distracting for sountracks, actually add to the musical effect. This sountrack is deserving of its Academy Award.
B00004XONN|4.0|Radiohead couldn't ever seem to quite get it right. They tried Brit-rock (Pablo Honey, The Bends) and that was terrible.  They tried straight electronic (Amnesiac) and that was downright revolting.  Only when they've mixed the two, on 1997's OK Computer and on this, Kid A, the more electronic of the two, does everything work out. The album starts with the average Everything in it's Right Place, but then moves on the impressive, suprisingly upbeat (trippy?) Kid A. Following is possibly Radiohead's greatest song of all time, the bass and horn heavy The National Anthem. Trumpets that go in seemingly no direction at all and a simplistic, yet incredible bass line provide for a great expierence. The almost equally impressive How to Dissapear Completely follows. Other standouts include Optimistic, In Limbo and Idioteque (which is amazing live, by the way). ... An impressive outing.
B00000J631|5.0|This is a really good cd that you listen to when you just dont wanna listen to one artist. The stand out tracks are avail, dog piss, sumthin radio, snuff and the hotbox track, its a good cd only i wish it wouldnt include pennywise, blink 182, offspring etc
B00005V9L1|4.0|I loved so much about this move that I've have givein it 5 stars...IF I understood the ending. Call me stupid - but I didn't. But that didn't stop me from enjoying the ride because the plot (basically a story of a boy who is either disturbed or spiritually in tune with time travel and the future)is so engaging. Jake Gyllenhall is dead on perfect as the teenager whose grasp of reality seems to be slipping and who occasionally sees a very spooky looking giant rabbit. The kid is seeing a psychiatrist because his parents are worried not only about his visions but about his past troubles (burning down an abandoned house, etc).<br /> What sets this movie apart from other spooky movies is the way the film shows the dark side of high school life. Patrick Swayze, no longer a regular in films, is good as the leader of a cult movement which is more than it appears...and so is its leader. Drew Barrymore is a teacher who wants her students to question their lives and who isn't afraid to confront the principal if she thinks he is wrong. Each character in this film is fresh, original and interesting to watch.<br /> And yet...I confess...the ending left me a bit puzzled and feeling left out of the loop. So if you understand it, please, please explain it to me.
B00003CXI1|5.0|This movie is simply amazing! Watching it brings me so much joy because i know all the hard work and the effort they put in thi movie payed off they got so much money! The #1 movie of 2001! And probably going to be The #1 selling DVD/VIDEO of 2002! Kudos goes out to everyone who is in it and who made it! And i cant wait for Harry Potter and The Chamber of Secret's!!!!!
B00005Q66T|4.0|This album is absolutely perfect for people who are not yet Madonna fans, but would like to get to know her music. First, go buy the Immaculate Collection, then come back and get this one. A lot of the songs are shorter edits of the original versions so this is a great sampler album which presents different types of music; from dance (Deeper And Deeper), to house (Erotica), to pop (Don't Tell Me), to electronica (Ray Of Light), to ballads (Take A Bow), and even r+b inspired (Human Nature). To all of Madonna's fans, quit complaining about no new tracks and wait for her new album. Leave this one to the general public!
B00005QK3W|3.0|Paul's got a nice sound on this album, good band, tight production, strong voice and bass.  But the songs are only so-so, and the lyrics make for tough listening sometimes.  A disappointment after Flaming Pie, which I'd give 4 or 4.5 stars.  Still, some good track here -- About You and Magic, especially -- but no real standouts to join Paul's best of the solo years.
B00000DGUG|5.0|I am a true fan of this young woman. She writes from inside and doesn't hold back. True emotion and talent. Highly recommended. Sit down and enjoy.
B000002LND|5.0|These songs are timeless, and in some cases, infamous! How can you not love these songs? It's impossible. Anyone who listens to this album will be hooked! This album is the reason I am a Madonna fan today, as it was my introduction to her music. And all of these songs were hits! Check out the peak positions of the songs included on this CD on the Billboard Hot 100 Singles Chart:<br />1. Holiday #16<BR>2. Lucky Star #4<BR>3. Borderline #10<BR>4. Like A Virgin #1<BR>5. Material Girl #2<BR>6. Crazy For You #1<br />7. Into The Groove (did not chart because it was not released as a single, but was still a massive radio hit!)<BR>8. Live To Tell #1<BR>9. Papa Don't Preach #1<BR>10. Open Your Heart #1<BR>11. La Isla Bonita #4<BR>12. Like A Prayer #1<BR>13. Express Yourself #2<BR>14. Cherish #2<BR>15. Vogue #1<BR>16. Justify My Love #1<BR>17. Rescue Me #9<br />And those were not even all of her hits up until that point! Those NOT included are: Angel #5, Dress You Up #5, True Blue #3, Who's That Girl #1, Causing A Commotion #2, Oh Father #20, Keep It Together #8, Hanky Panky #10. Madonna knows how to deliver good pop songs. These songs will bring back memories for you...<br />Get it now!!
0061091480|5.0|This was the first &quot;self help&quot; book I read, and even now, years later, I remember the message Wayne Dyer stressed, which was the uselessness of worry and guilt. I highly recommend this book, it is very healing and uplifting.
B00005JKJA|3.0|This hasn't a single special feature beyond the trailer. Even worse is that this is the first DVD that I ever seen that doesn't allow you to select scenes. There is no chapter select menu, and there is no option while watching the film to skip ahead to the next scene. This movie is has ONE CHAPTER. Rent this film, and wait 3 months to buy it when they sell it again as a Special Edition to all us suckers who couldn't wait.
B00005JKDR|5.0|This movie rocked!!  Pixar did a wonderful job of taking one of a typical child's fears and turning it into a great idea for a movie.  All the actors lending their voices to the characters were perfect choices, and the animation was just amazing.  Great movie for audiences of all ages.
0767819446|3.0|This is an incredible movie. I absolutely loved its new ideas and brave theories. It made me think, and brought up all sorts of questions. It shouldn't have made me think, because the movie wasn't prepared to answer any of the questions it brought up. I'm not going to give anything away, but the final portion of this movie isn't deserving of the first ( and wonderful ) parts. Just when The Thirteenth Floor is on the threshold ( actually, it goes beyond the threshold ) it goes into a series of... <BR>Horror movie cliches ?<BR>I'd recommend this movie, if only for the first half. It's too bad about the rest of it though. The Thirteenth Floor really could've been something. And it was, at least for a little while.
B00003CY0V|5.0|In my opinion, all of the actors in this movie did excellent jobs at the roles they played.  There was plenty of action in this movie to keep me interested, and the idea basically spawns from the theory of \\"fighting fire with fire.\\"  Travolta's character basically fights terrorism with terrorism.  Halle Berry does an excellent job of keeping Jackman interested in the plan, which is to steal roughly 10 billion dollars from the government.  The whole movie keeps you asking questions about it, which can basically make the movie worth seeing again and again, to allow you to understand what's happening.  I recommend this movie to everyone (over a certain age of course).  Go rent it!  Go buy it!  Just go see it!
B000002J1I|5.0|Tormato is unfortunately very underrated by not only Yes fans but by the pulic at large. This 1978 release is no doubt one of their finest collections of tracks. I agree with another Amazon reviewer who stated that if stuck on an island with only one Yes album, Tormato would be the one.<br />All of the members were obvioulsy into this project. Squires bass sounds like it will soon catch fire like combustable match-wood. Howe is all over this project, using his loose and inspired guitar work like a painter on canvas. <br />Tormato gives the listener many details and variations. From powerful and thoughful to passionate. It is all here presented in a compact and timeless release. <br />Please listen to Tormato. If you are a Yes fan it will make you wonder why you downrated it. If you are not a Yes fan, Tormato may soon make you one!
B00005JKJA|5.0|Probably Lynch's best film, easily. This incredible film etches itself into your mind and keeps you thinking about it for quite some time.<BR> A woman is in an accident on Mulholland Drive and wanders into the home of an actress who is filming a movie in Canada. Her niece, an aspiring actress herself, has just arrived in Hollywood completely awestruck and finds the amnesiac &quot;Rita&quot; in the home and shrouds herself in helping the woman find who she is.<BR> Filled with tons of climaxes and the usual creepy characters that Lynch is so famous for, this flick takes hold of you like a disturbing dream and doesn't let go, only to leave you shaking once it has ended.
B000000H3Z|5.0|After purchasing the slighty disappointing Roots, I decided to come back to this classic. I applaud Sepultura for reaching out and attempting to cross-pollinate genres of music. Roots did that very well. Much better than the current rap-metal sellout monster that is Max and Soulfly. However, Beneath The Remains was even more groundbreaking. It didn't require a \\"tribe\\" gimmick to garner notice from metallers worldwide. It blasted onto the underground heavy music scene and shoved itself down the world's throat, with Max and Andreas riffing at 240 a minute, and Paulo and Igor rhythmically backing like the masters they are. No jungle stuff here. It's all just thrash guitar and guttural vocals. Many say that this is the worthy successor to Slayer's Reign In Blood. I'll do them all one better. I actually PREFER this to Reign In Blood. It's not of the masterpiece quality that Arise and Chaos A.D. achieved simply because Sepultura grew over time and topped themselves through slight experimentation. This album still kicks ..., though, even to this day. Sepultura's first hit \\"Inner Self,\\" is here. I actually like the live version on Chaos A.D. better, just for the superior musicianship, but this holds the original fire of the song. Other great pieces are \\"Beneath The Remains,\\" \\"Lobotomy,\\" \\"Mass Hypnosis,\\" and \\"Hungry.\\" Aw, hell...the whole album's great. This was Sep's first true thrash album, and influenced countless bands in the future-all of whom are better than Soulfly, mind you. Pick this up, then get Arise for the same thing done better. Chaos A.D. is the seminal 90's thrash/tribal/crunch masterpiece, so get that. If you're adventurous, get Roots and Nation. Keep in mind, though...Beneath The Remains will always be a classic thrash metal album.
B00004Z459|5.0|BOOOO yah, these songs rock n i never stopped listenin 2 them. Out of all my 40 cd's this one is DA best!! LP rocks the hill MAN! some of the tracks have their own personality n stories great job mike :)!!! Chester sings the slow part or mostly the chorus parts and mike is the rapper of this album.

B00004W5UA|5.0|First of all this film is easily easily one of the best films I have ever been fortunate to see. Even though I could not stop laughing throughout the majority of this film it would be extremely insulting to classify this piece of art as a comedy when it defies all possible labels. As a matter of fact the evil of labels is the thesis \\"Fight Culb\\" basically expresses; \\"You are not your job, or how much money you have in the bank.\\" This film identifies itself with not only the anti-establisment element but more essentially as an anti-consumer advocate. <br /> Besides the insightful themes the viewer will also be delighted with the superb performances of both Norton and Pitt. I have seen all of Norton's work and the majority of Pitt's and I can declare without a doubt that their performances in \\"Fight Club\\" is by far the best of both their careers.
B00005V9HH|5.0|This is the kind of movie I love....great actors, suspense, and a twist at the end...This movie always left me wondering thru out who the main character/killer was...until the very end you find out....
B000002U8G|4.0|Meddle marked a change in the direction of Pink Floyd which was not always welcomed. The band had changed direction once before following the Madcap days and had produced live performances exhibited by Ummagumma which were inspiring many musicians especially in Germany. Atom Heart Mother for all of the unity of the title track was a collection of odds and ends in anticipation of a Pink Floyd album to be made with everyday household instruments.<br />What resulted was Meddle, 'Echoes' being considered as the stripped down Floyd without the choir and all. The album as a whole has interesting special effects, the most eerie of which was Nick Mason's voice on the first track 'One of these Days', the wonderful Liverpool 'Kop' in fine voice providing us with 'You'll Never Walk Alone' and the dog.<br />Fans of this album point to Echoes as the highlight of the album and to the extent that it has the band displaying all of the properties which made them such an attraction in big stadiums along with their incomparable light show it certainly is. To my view though it is a disappointment and shows that the band had reached an impasse and lost their direction a bit. It marks the ascendancy of Roger Waters as de facto leader of the band whose songs would soon become dominant. Of course the commercial success of the next album, 'Dark Side' would prove to be the clincher for their subsequent direction which they would be unable to escape from.<br />Consider for a moment the future as it might have been. A Pink Floyd utilising those musical skills that they had to provide more of an instrumental future. This future has already been glimpsed by the albums made after Waters departure. This future would be also ground breaking, a future with an intelligent use of synthesisers and special effects to produce music to compete with the so-called 'Krautrock' which was in effect their progeny. Alas it was not to be so.<br />A well played album nevertheless and of course, awesome live.
B00005V0X5|5.0|It took me a while before I decided to get this album.  Mainly because I have the original release, the one with uncensored These Boots.<BR>I'm a fool not to get this earlier.  This album is a thrash metal masterpiece.  After listening to this remastered version, I agree with Scott Ian(from Anthrax).  This is the best debut album from the Big Four(Megadeth, Metallica, Anthrax, Slayer).<BR>The sound quality is way better than the original release, its almost like listen to new song.<BR>If you like thrash metal you should get this album even if you already have the original release.
B000002U82|5.0|the dark side of the moon is a wonderful masterpiece that should be owned by everyone!!!!!!!!  you MUST buy this kick [rear] album ASAP!!!!!!!!!! I love it!!!!!!!!!!
B00004Z459|5.0|I absolutely LOVE this album. \\"Linkin Park\\" rocks the house without being overly profane and violent. The guitar will blow you away, and the lyrics are terrific. You cannot listen to this album without wanting to get up and dance; it is impossible. I first heard the song \\"Crawling\\" on [the radio at](My college). I loved it, but I didn't know who sang it. I heard somebody behind me make a smart-aleck comment that \\"Weezer\\" sang it, but I knew he was not telling the truth. Weezer is MUCH lighter than that. I finnally found out who sang it on the teen choice awards on [tv], and the next chance I got, I went out and bought the album. Go out and get it yourself. You won't regret it.
B00003CXDV|5.0|Having seen this movie in theatre I knew I have to have it on DVD. But due stupid DVD encoding and even more stupid region locking which only prevents DVD technology from replacing VHS and which only lower profit of movie companies, I had to find out few fixes to my DVD and PC.<BR>But it worth! Galaxy Quest is one of the finest SF parody I have ever seen and it uses well known StarTrek like background where group of ex-STlike-TV-series is hired by group od aliens (Thermians) to protect the remnant of their race from evil attakers led by Sarris. You should have to have at least some knowledge about StarTrek (TOS and TNG) series and its common plots and schemes. Just compare the way how Tim Allen behave like William Shattner on the bridge (sitting at cpt's chair, gesturing before lift-off etc.)<BR>I do not like to reveal any of many gags and funny events stuffed into this film, so I tell you instead that I like this movie as well as SHREK or MONSTER INC. So that should tell you something.
0399146369|4.0|The first time I started 'The Last Precinct' was almost 6 months ago.  At that time I was simply not able to get past the first hundred or so pages of Kay Scarpetta 's problems.  It may just be my perception, but even before Benton Wesley's death, Virginia's Chief Medical Officer has had a tendency towards the negative.  Now, with Wesley dead, Scarpetta recovering from a violent attack by Jean-Baptiste Chandonne, and the police firmly in charge of her house and car during the investigation, she is simply devastated.  Neither her colleague Captain Pete Marino, her niece Lucy, nor her friend Dr. Anna Zenner seems able to shake her from a continuous flow of angry self pity.  As a reader one can only be so sympathetic, and I lost patience with the book far earlier than I usually do.<br />On this, my second attempt, I knew what to expect and managed to work past the worst of the tirades.  Eventually the complex plot begins to overtake the emotional overtones and the story takes on more interest.  Scarpetta seems to be assaulted on all sides.  She is wrapped up in the Chandonne case, having blinded him with formalin in her efforts to save herself.  Buford Righter, the Commonwealth's Attorney is investigating Kay's possible complicity in the murder of Diane Bray.  Lucy has been put on administrative leave by the ATF.  And a pair of torture murders baffle everyone with apparent links to the Chandonne case.  From Scarpetta's viewpoint the world seems upside-down, and very little makes sense.<br />To make matters more complicated Jaime Berger, the head of New York City's Sex Crimes Division has asked that Chandonne be tried as a suspect in a crime committed three years earlier.  A political deal has been cut, and Berger is suddenly in Virginia, and in everyone's face as well.  No matter which way she turns, Kay Scarpetta seems to find a layer of half-truths and betrayals.  New themes blend with old to create a heady mixture of facts and red herrings.  Only gradually does the architecture of the crimes evolve into a pattern that makes sense.<br />'The Last Precinct' is an ending, and perhaps, a new beginning.  As such the reader will find that many earlier Cornwell novels are echoed again.  Countless old characters reappear or are remembered as Kay Scarpetta life is led to resolution, and she is forced to ask herself the tough questions she has so far avoided.  As a character Scarpetta deepens considerable, as do those of Lucy and Marino.  This is not an entirely enjoyable book to read.  We must endure a fair amount of Kay Scarpetta's pain to get at the story.  Personally I would have preferred a lighter brush.  But if the tale is a bit heavy-handed it provides as much material for the future of the series as it resolves.  I suspect we have not yet seen the last of Kay Scarpetta.<br />Kate Reading does a superb job of reading the book in the tape version, capturing a rhythm and clarity that are not as immediately apparent in the book itself.  She manages a variety of accents and deliveries comfortably, without going to extremes.  Be warned that the tapes represent over 17 hours of listening.architecture of the crimes evolve into a pattern that makes sense.<br />'The Last Precinct' is an ending, and perhaps, a new beginning.

B000056V73|5.0|This is one of the best movies I've seen in years. Cameron Crowe perfectly captures the entire essence of that not-really -too-long -ago-but-a-lifetime-ago-time. Yes, if you were there (circa early 1970's), this movie will totally fulfill any nostalgic yearnings. It brought back faces & places I hadn't thought about in 30 years. Those fabulous, jewel-bedecked, feathered creatures, standing off to the side of the stage, while Alice Cooper or Black Sabbath blew our minds at ear-splitting volume, I always wondered (and envied) what their lives were like. HOW did THEY get in?? (God, I was dumb.) And even if you weren't(there), the performances are all SO great, that this is the closest you can come to \\"being there.\\" You WILL smell patchouli! Yes, I, like many, very much identify with the un-cool, rock star worshipping 15 year old, \\"William\\". (I even had that same awful, swept over, un-hair-do!) And was just as naive. We ALL wanted to hit the road, & follow around our favorite band, & this movie ALMOST fulfills that un-fulfilled desire. But it's about so much more. It is also a beautiful coming of age story. I had never seen Kate Hudson before, but from the moment she enters her first scene, you'll be enamored of her beauty, screen prescence, and obvious intelligence beyond her years. I deplore hype, but everything they've said about this actress is true (for once). Her \\"Penny Lane\\" is much more then a groupie. Really, all the players in this film are great, and there's not a wasted moment. That director Crowe based William on himself is obvious & now well known. How perfect that, in \\"real\\" life, he got his own rock goddess, in marrying Nancy Wilson, of the fabulous \\"Heart\\". Dreams really can come true. I haven't seen the un-issued version, but, after reading the reviews of those who have, I plan to. There's really so much to say about this great film, so, just SEE it. I suspect those few who REALLY disliked this film probably went into it with a bug up their...! Ignore them, they have no taste, & probably dress badly. I've seen this about 4 times now, & loved it more at each viewing. I think you will too. So, enjoy one of the best movies made in 2000 (or in many a year.)Just... GREAT!!!!!!them, they have no taste, & probably dress badly. I've seen this about 4 times now, & loved it more at each viewing. I think you will too. So, enjoy one of the best movies made in 2000 (or in many a year.)Just... GREAT!!!!!!

0792844890|5.0|OK, at first when I heard the title I was like I am not watching this movie until my friend told me it's funny.It is so hilarious. I laughed soo much.I can't get over some lines from the movie such as:<br />&quot;I am your father's brother's nephew's roomate.&quot; &quot;So what does it make us?&quot; &quot;Asbolutely nothing!&quot;<br />Ludecris speed ~ haha this is really funny I can't believe they have this. Also the activation code was really obvious, 12345, like they said its an activation code on a luggage.<br />Its a great movie even if its from 1987 and I can't they made fun of Planet of the Apes (old version). I just recently watched this movie and I think everyone  who sad should watch it.
B00003CXTG|5.0|I think this movie has a good love story.I think everybody should see this movie.
B00005RY7X|5.0|I'm not going to start with a bunch of disclaimers about AWK having no talent (BULL) yet I love it anyway... it's just a damn good CD. I haven't found a CD that I can listen to from the first track to the last without having the urge to skip songs since The Descendents put out \\"Everything Sucks\\" several years ago.<br />As for the sound... imagine the Bosstones ditching the horns and having a bloody run-in with Springsteen circa \\"Born to Run,\\" with a little Europe and Meatloaf thrown in, and some oi style gang vocals to make sure you're singing along and having a good time.<br />I actually jones for this CD when it's not on sometimes... listen to it a couple times to get my fix, then have to turn it off so I can come down. Good stuff.
B00003CXTG|4.0|Watch it if you can.It probably is worth the money but it won't have the &quot;wow&quot; effect on you when you finish it.
B00005OC06|5.0|Puccini's Madama Butterfly conducted by Von Karajan and the sublime voices of Placido Domingo and  Mirella Freni are a combination that, in my mind, is unbeatable.  It should be kept in mind that when this film was made Freni and Domingo were not yet 40 - a time in their lives and careers when their voices were at their peaks.  Being able to see and hear them as they were then makes this film historic.<br />When it comes to acting, I'll grant you that Placido Domingo and Mirella Freni are not in the same league with Laurence Olivier and Vivien Leigh, but they nonetheless committed themselves admirably in this project.  I was especially smitten with Mirella Freni's portrayal of Cio Cio San.  I see Cio Cio San as a very young (15?) girl who is painfully shy and oh so sensitive and naïve.  A girl who fell in love with love with Pinkerton (the bum!) at the center of this tragedy - a girl who later became a textbook case of denial in the 2nd act that was finally driven to end her own life.  That's what Freni conveyed to me and no matter how many times I watch this production, I am driven literally to tears.  <br />The film and directing had a few rough spots - camera angles in particular - I'm sure Ponnelle would have some second thoughts.  However, those details notwithstanding,  the soft monotones he used throughout created an aura that was perfect background for the drama that unfolded within it.<br />I feel obliged to say something here about lip synching - one of the curses of this sort of filmmaking.  I've watched this film countless times (I'm addicted!)  and the characters mouths work along with lyrics most convincingly.  Were they to be singing it live there would be some not very attractive facial contortions involved in vowel production and high notes requiring some visible \\"reaching\\" on the part of the singer that would certainly not be in keeping with Freni's fragile beauty or Domingo's handsome countenance.  So, with this in mind, I say bravo to lip-synching here.<br />The rest of the supporting cast did their respective jobs most admirably - Senechal as oily &quot;wasp - toad&quot; Goro, Kerns as the counsel, Sharpless, in the middle, and Ludwig as loyal Suziki were perfect. <br />If you're looking for historic and heart wrenching opera video, you've found it here.
B00003CXTG|5.0|This movie is alot better than what the critics think-not nearly the love story Titanic was.
B000060P79|5.0|let me tell ya, this is the greatest rock ever! i first wanted ta buy this CD 'cause of its amazing song \\"I'd Do Anything\\". i first heard it on \\"Maybe It's Me\\" and it's the best song on this CD! yeah, but it's kinda hard to pick the best one 'cause they're all good! but check it out for yaselves. i totally recommend this CD.
B00003CXXO|4.0|\\"A.I.\\" was considered one of the biggest movie disappointments of the last year.  This strikes me as slightly odd, since it is a much better movie than \\"Moulin Rouge,\\" and it even made more money.  Moreover, it is a much more beautiful film.  But certainly the plot does not sound promising.  A robot designed to look like a child, played by an actor one could accuse of being excessively cute, is programmed to love his human \\"mother\\".  After being heartlessly abandoned by her, he goes through an overly long search and is confronted with many examples of the cruelty of humanity.  In the end he briefly meets her and is reconciled with her in an ending my brother and other people thought was sentimental beyond belief.  No, this does not sound promising, and since we all know that Spielberg is a fundamentally manipulative and derivative film-maker, surely he could not say something truly thoughtful.  Especially since he was working on an idea by Stanley Kubrick, a man infamous for his special style of facile misanthropy.<br />I disagree.  First off, there's Joel Haley Osment, whose performance is excellent.  Even the most rigorous and unsentimental of critics, the Village Voice's J. Hoberman, who was not enthusiastic about the movie, thought that Osment gave the best leading performance of the last year.  And Osment is giving a performance of something that is unique in Spielberg's work.  He is playing someone who is NOT human.  Most of the literary depiction of robots or aliens fail to truly imagine what that is like.  Star Trek is the best (and worst) example of this, since the aliens, or robots like Data or Seven of Nine, end up like humans.  Moreover, they end up like very American humans, the world of white suburbia, with American confidence, an American sense of the possibilities of life, with American consumerism, and an American religiosity.  Osment, by contrast, is \\"off,\\" his love may be real, but it is programmed, it is never spontaneous.  <br />Given David's lack of humanity, one can therefore imagine why Frances O'Connor would be originally cold to him, why she would warm to him as a substitute for her real son, and why she would eventually break with him when her real son miraculously revived.  It has been objected that David is unconvicing in contrast to Gigolo Joe, who is able to convince women to sleep with him.  But Gigolo Joe is little more than a congenial sex aid, an evolutionary step up of the chatterbox vending machines on the Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy, but ultimately no more.  David is trying to love someone, something infinitely more difficult.<br />But surely, one might object, it is unfair to portray the humans in this movie as heartless and cruel, since after all in the real world there are no real robots to show their malice towards.  And there is no doubt that misanthropy has been a problem in Kubrick's work.  \\"A Clockwork Orange\\" is a failure because Kubrick so relentlessly stacks the deck in Alex's favor.  And the human characters in \\"2001\\" are not so much what it is like to be actually dehumanized as empty zombies, facile abstractions of vacuity.  <br />But there is another side to it.  As Stuart Klawans pointed out, whose film-maker's emotional effects depend on mechanical manipulation than Spielberg himself?  If David's love is not convicing, has it ever been so in Spielberg's movies? There is an element of self-criticism in this movie, which is not entirely conscious.  As Jonathan Rosenbaum says, this is a movie that is so dialectical it is schizophrenic.  Consider the infamous ending.  Why should the mechas who find David and momentarily resurrect his mother announce their admiration for humans, consider how we have conducted themselves in the movie?  But consider Jim Ridley's words:  \\"To become human, the ending says, is to commit desperately selfish and solipsistic acts, to expect technology to satisfy one's emotional needs, to play God just to preserve the illusion of normalcy.\\"  And that, unfortunately, and as Spielberg knows too well, is not facile misanthropy.  The reconciliation is sentimental, but it is also unreal, and only temporary.
B00004SU5J|5.0|It's hard to add to the wonderful commentary that has come before me on the compositions and performances on this recording.<br />Here is music that is at once familiar and hypnotic without ever going over the top.  It is intellectual, creative, and accessible without ever being maudlin.  It is terrific dance music, too.  So many musical styles all melded boggle the mind because one is at once conscious of their co-existence and marvelled at their ingenuity....and sheer fun.<br />I found this CD in of all places, an exotic furniture and clothing emporium in Miami.  From the get go, it has been near the top of the list of CDs I keep coming back to.<br />GET IT.
0385505833|4.0|This won't keep you guessing and wondering who's guilty-- or not-- and how the plot will unfold. You pretty much figure it out within the first few pages. Then, again, what's most captivating about this tale is not what the people (the Kranks) do-- but that they even do it at all! And, it something we wish we could do-- if we're honest. Skip Christmas!?!?<br />In the line of Charles Dickens (even the names of the people reflect who they are-- think, Krank, Scrooge, Tom Thumb...), Grisham weaves this little story (short enough to read in one sitting, long enough to allow you to read a chapter a night before bed) that takes us not only through the actual act of skipping Christmas (in a way), but takes us through the pyschology of it as well. We feel-- and identify-- with the tensions of money spent, good gifts given and bad gifts received, parties no one wants to go to but needs to show out for anyway, etc...<br />Oddly enough, the quirky story is a small mirror that reveals much to you (if you'll admit it, and wrestle with it) about the condition of your own soul.
B00003CX5P|5.0|Star Wars Episode I: the Phantom Menace was the most anticipated film of all time.  The hype behind it was enormous.  The characters of the movie graced everything from action figures to toothpaste bottles to inflatable chairs.  So it comes as no surprise that the movie didn't live up to everyone's expectations.  Many people complained to no end about it. But, when get past the hype and internet complaints, you have yourself a pretty decent movie.  Sure it had some bad parts.  Okay, it had some REALLY bad parts. The story wasn't all that fascinating, tha characterization is weak, Darth Vader's an exuberant little kid, And Jar Jar Binks is the most annoying character ever.  But the movie is still worthy of the Star Wars title.  I can't tell you how many times I was in gasping in awe of the sheer visuals in the film.  To me, the good redeems the movie for it's worser parts.  As for the legions of fans who hated this movie, I think they were expecting it to be like the first time theysaw Star Wars.  News flash for you folks: it's a slim chance that you'll ever have that experience again in your life.  Only the true fans can appreciate the film for what it is.<BR>And the geeks who spend all their time on the internet and complain about Jar Jar Binks? They need to get a life.
B00003CX5P|3.0|It took me two viewings to fully appreciate the beginning of the most famous trilogy created.  The movie had an enormous build-up and no movie could fully live up to the hype, but it just was not a great movie as the other three were.  The look of the movie was absolutely spectacular with full digital worlds that looked incredibly real and lifelike.  However, the same could not be said for the characters.  They are as flat and dull and seem to be inserted to let Lucas expand his digi-lands.  THe dialogue is sparse and uninteresting and there isn't the same feel as the other movies.  For many fans, the first three movies had a &quot;magical&quot; feel as we followed the story.  This movie didn't seem to have any magic or warmth like the others.  I think the tech-heavy feel of this movie had something to do with it.  Many will disagree, but I thought the kid who played Annakin was perfect and was one of the bright spots of the movie.  Liam Neeson and Ewan McGregor were fine but were given extremely little to work with.  The dialogue in the movie was rather dull and uninteresting unlike the vivid images and breathtaking special effects.  As one reviewer said, this movie was just an introduction to all the characters thus, the plodding pace of the movie.  However, if this would have been the beginning to the Star Wars saga, it would be a blip on the movie map, instead of a major destination.
B00005JKL8|3.0|This movie has the ingrediants with a good star cast ,great special effects an super scrip but fails to deliver at the end of it all.Gene Hackman plays the role(model) he loves to do best an a promising Owens lives upto expectations but.........still a burnt cake.
B00005O3VC|5.0|After their comedy series sadly left the airwaves, the Monty Pythons decided to venture into the realm of cinema. They only made four movies in total, but these four movies have gone on to be comedy classics. Hardcore Python fans might say that \\"The Life of Brian\\" was their best (albeit contraversial) film, but almost any casual Python fan or comedy fan in general will give \\"Monty Python and the Holy Grail\\" that title. How this film compares to the other Python films isn't that important, however, because \\"Monty Python and the Holy Grail\\" is one of the funniest films ever made and a true comedy classic. And with the Special Edition DVD, we get full exposure to Monty Python's insane movie.<br />By now, the plot of \\"Holy Grail\\" is so well known that it can be quoted off the bat by almost anyone. King Arthur and his legendary Knights of the Round Table (Sir Lancelot, Sir Galahad, Sir Not-Appearing-In-This-Film, etc.) have been charged by God Himself to find the Holy Grail. To find it, they must overcome terrible dangers such as a three-headed knight, Frenchmen with outrageous accents, the dreaded Knights Who Say \\"Ni!\\", the virgin women of Castle Anthrax, and so forth.<br />It's not the plot of \\"Holy Grail\\" so much as it is the humor that makes this film a classic. To fully describe Monty Python's humor would do them a great injustice; it is so unique that it would be easy to spot one of their films a mile away amidst a sea of imitators. In \\"Holy Grail\\", this uniqueness works so well it's frightening. Plot elements flow smoothly from one to another (despite the fact each plot element is a separate \\"skit\\") and the movie as a whole is a cinematic masterpiece. Probably the only gripe I have with this film is the ending, which was a bit anti-climactic, but other than that \\"Holy Grail\\" is perfect in every way.<br />So, we have a great movie on our hands. What about the Special Edition? Let me just say that any fan of \\"Holy Grail\\" is missing out on the ultimate experience ifthey miss this DVD. This Special Edition is packed with extras, including but not limited to: an extra 24 (yes, 24!) seconds of film, a documentary on how the Pythons scouted movie locations, a scene from the movie done entirely in LEGO, an educational video on how to use coconuts, and so much more. There is so much stuff here that it'll keep the Python lover occupied for a long time coming. However, there is a slight glitch in the film that causes subtitles to appear sporadically in the film (I believe they're found in the places marked for the \\"Follow the Killer Rabbit\\" feature). While not life-threatening, it can get a little annoying.<br />Overall, \\"Monty Python and the Holy Grail: Special Edition\\" is worth any fan's time and money. It gives them a chance to own one of the funniest and greatest films ever made, while also offering some insane extras that aren't found anywhere else. Whether \\"Holy Grail\\" is the greatest Python film is debatable; whether it's worth owning isn't. Go get it! Now!
B000002UAO|5.0|I'm not going to write a big long summary of this album. Why? Because it's all been said before. This is the definitive Beatles album. It represents everything The Beatles were about, being the masters of rock. The songs on this album are absolute masterpieces. At the time when this album was released, the lyrics and production on this album was like nothing ever heard before. This is the greatest Beatles album. Don't call yourself a music enthusiast until you've heard this.
B000060K4P|5.0|The Movies<br />The Original *****<br />Dan Aykroyd, Bill Murray, and Harold Remis play three scientists studying supernatural phenoema. But when they are kicked out of the university, they must find a way to still study the paranormal, thus the form the Ghostbusters. At first they are low on money and business is very slow, but they soon earn their fame and success. But when all hell breaks loose across New York City, the major and law enforcement turn to their only hope- the Ghostbusters. <br />The Sequel *****<br />Ghostbusters 2 was an excellent, faithful sequel that lived up to the standards of the original. Incorporating all of the original cast five years later; mostly all separated doing different jobs that correlate to their personality. Once again supernatural occurrences start to surpass the law enforcements comprehension, therefore they turn to the professionals- the Ghostbusters. This sequel is well worth watching and very enjoyable. Actually, this film is quite scary in some parts and aspects that add to it's features of comedy, suspense, and action. This sequel is definitely one you won't want to miss!  <br />The DVD- Ghostbusters 1 *****<br />At first there were a large batch of defective Ghostbusters 1&2 DVDs released that had many glitches including one major problem: the inability for the DVD player to detect the second half of the film. ... The Ghostbusters DVD is impressive for it's release date: 1999. The features include:<BR>Scene Selection<BR>Subtitles<BR>5.1 Dolby Digital<BR>1999 Feaurette and Original Feaurette<BR>Deleted scenes<BR>Storyboards<BR>Trailers<BR>Production Photos/Conceptual Drawings <BR>SFX Team Documentary<BR>SFX Before and After (Multi-Angle)<BR>Digitally Remastered<BR>Widescreen Format<BR>Many films released to present day don't even have the plethora of features Ghostbusters has! Any enthusiast of Ghostbusters will adore the special features and layout of the DVD!<br />The DVD- Ghostbusters 2 **<br />Limited features accompany this spectacular sequel that really deserved more than this vague DVD. Fans will be disappointed with the DVD's limited amount of features that only include:<BR>5.1 Dolby Digital <BR>Widescreen/Full Screen Formats <BR>Productions Notes<BR>Talent & Filmographies<BR>Subtitles<BR>The DVD is mostly giving the viewer the prerequisite features being: 5.1 Dolby Digital and Widescreen. One can infer that great amount of time and effort put into 1st movie and the short, vague DVD of the sequel.<br />Pros: 1. Ghostbusters is a great classic that one will want to see again and again.<BR>      2. Ghostbusters 2 surpasses a sequels stereotype (cheap and repetitive) it's exciting, funny, and even scary.<BR>      3. Ghostbusters DVD will fulfill fans expectations of the genre; numerous special features and an animated menu.<br />Cons: 1. Ghostbusters 2 DVD was vague, despicable, ... but it did include prerequisites. Fans will be disappointed with this DVD.
B000002MP2|5.0|This, is without a shadow of a doubt, a classic. This cd lays out the blueprint for any pop-punk band trying to make it big. Green Day are the unquestionable &quot;messiahs&quot; of the pop-punk revolution. Ever wonder where bands like Blink 182 and Sum 41 got the ambition to play music? I'll bet you they got it from this album. Songs like &quot;Burnout&quot; and &quot;Basketcase&quot; will never fade. Green Day, in their own right, are living legends. Any true music enthusiast will buy this cd, whether you're a punk fan or not. It's a VERY important album and everyone should own a copy.
B00005RY7X|5.0|I first heard Andrew WK when I saw him/them on Saturday Night Live.  They were so loud, so obnoxious, so in-your-face, so juvenile, and so absolutely, unapologetically over the top that I was blown away.  The CD is a winner; every song is great, which is not surprising given that it's basically the same song repeated over and over.  The style is fascinating; it's basically a combination of punk rock, Phil-Spectorish walls of sound, and 80s arena rock played at ear-splitting volumes.  It sounds like there's about twenty guitars pounding out the same three chords at the same time, and as if that's not enough, there's heavy keyboards layered over every track, also pounding out the same three chords.  Lyrically, it's pretty simplistic; I don't think any band since AC/DC has so unabashedly celebrated the delights of procreation, pugilism, and partying like this band.  The music is simplistic too; in fact, it's so simplistic it makes Motorhead sound like chamber music.  But none of that matters, because if this album doesn't make you bang your head within a maximum of three seconds, you either hate rock and roll or you're clinically dead.  Five stars?  Heck, I'd give this ten stars.  Go out and buy the CD right now, and while you're at it, pick up a case of beer.  You'll need it.
B0000507UD|1.0|I NEVER liked Limp Bizkit. In fact, the ONLY reason I bought this cd is because a friend of mine said that it was \\"the best thing Limp Bizkit has ever done.\\" Boy, what a load of crap that was! This cd perfectly displays how Limp Bizkit was one of rock/metal's biggest mistakes. It's a pure disgrace to know that KoRn, the most important band in metal history in my opinion, discovered these [guys]. The music that Limp Bizkit plays on here is as always, repetitive and bland. Fred Durst doesn't even attempt to sing on here. Why bother? We've all heard him try to sing, and he just plain [not good]! And also, the constant use of the f-word is just kind of immature. REAL musicians don't find it necessary to constantly use profanities in their songs. Avoid this cd at all costs. Nothing on this cd is worth anyone's time.
6305897786|5.0|... This movie is too dark for many people, I would guess, and probably spends too much time setting the stage for others.  However, dark though it be, this movie is tremendously witty, and there is a quirky humor to the movie, aided by Johnny Depp's nailing the lead role down perfectly.  If you love this movie as I do, you MUST read the book its based on, The Club Dumas, by Arturo Perez-Reverte.  The Ninth Gate is a clever adaption of the book.  While the book has three interwoven plot lines (only one of them being based on the occult), the movie is basicly an adaption of one of those lines, with elements of the other plot lines being included for color personality and character development.  Endings differ as a result, but both endings are a good fit given the direction taken in each medium.  While the movie is thus a dramatic departure from the book in some ways, it is true to its spirit and Depp does a great job of \\"getting\\" the character in the book and bringing it to the film.  If the screenplay had followed the interweaving plot of the book loyally, the movie would have been much slower, and though I would still have loved it, I suspect it would have had even more trouble at the box office.  I can't say which I like better, the book or the movie -- a complement to both.
B000002U9W|5.0|After Syd Barret left Pink Floyd, the band seemed to struggle to find their sound again without contriving Syd Barett's sound. To me, &quot;Atom Heart Mother&quot; shows Pink Floyd finding themselves again and putting out one of their best albums. &quot;Atom Heart Mother&quot; has everything on it including the kitchen sink. However on &quot;Atom Heart Mother&quot; instead of overwhelming the listener and making a random mess of sound, Pink Floyd begin to sound polished and matured but still keep an experimental edge to keep the music fresh and underground. &quot;Atom Heart Mother&quot; also sets up how most of the other Pink Floyd albums would be set up. The opening track would be a very long experimental (usually instrumental) track, the next three would be &quot;proper&quot; sounding songs at a regular song length, and the last track would seem to reconnect back up with the beginning. Also one of my personal favorite Pink Floyd songs is on this album; &quot;Summer 68'&quot; The piano is beautiful and the lyrics are very personal for me. &quot;If&quot; is also a simple and pretty ballad. All and all, &quot;Atom Heart Mother&quot; would make it on a list of my top five favorite Floyd albums so it is well worth getting for new and old fans alike.

0451450523|5.0|This is one book that should be on every fantasy lover's &quot;Must Read&quot; list. Beagle does a masterful job of weaving fantasy, adventure, romance, and humor, adding just a dash of the unexpected juxtaposition of the &quot;modern&quot; with the fantastic. He has a way with words that is truly musical, that hits a chord inside you and makes you nod your head in agreement. And most importantly, while the story can certainly be read as a simple fairy tale, there's more going on than just a good story. Beagle teaches his reader a valuable lesson about the nature of love and life. The last two chapters of this book are heartwrenching, and every time I read it I have to have a box of tissues handy, but there are tears of joy and sadness combined.
B00005K3O4|5.0|Well folks, let me start this off by saying I think this movie is probably the closest you can get to theeee perfect movie.  I mean, hey, it's got the most in-depth plot I've ever seen!  Heck, look at the cast, you've got errr, some hick, his dog pooh bear, and umm, some other people.  I don't think I've ever been so afraid of a shadow puppet.  Nowadays, whenever someone starts to do that, I just shout \\"AHHH STOP!\\" cuz it brings me back to that moment in the movie.  I always knew clowns were suspicious characters, but this movie proves it, I'll never look at a red nose the same way again.  Ok, people, trust me, if youve never seen this, buy it!  Make shure you have someone along to make fun of it with though, cuz its not too hard to point out its, err, weak points. ;)
B00005UEAR|5.0|i could write for hours about how amazing SDOIT is.  suffice it to say that this band continues to stun me with their level of skill.  from the full frontal assault of \\"glass prison\\" to the acoustic/jazz-tinged (dare i say approaching pop) \\"solitary shell\\", these guys simply rock.  james labrie's voice is the best out there.  mike portnoy's playing is as tight as it has ever been and he keeps getting better (if that's actually possible?)  john myung's bass starts off the album and his bottom line drives the band forward without hesitation (he definitely needs more praise for his skill!!!!!!!).  jordan rudess is simply awesome.  unfortunately, there are no words to describe john petrucci's guitar playing.  he is the king and on this album he continues to put himself above the rest.  if you are a fan of rush, yes, pantera, vai/satch, excellent songwriting, and a band at the top of its game, get this album.  you will not be disappointed (the same goes for ALL of the other dream theater albums as well)!!!!!!!!
B00005YW4H|5.0|Its perfect. Its absolutely perfect.
B000063CMK|5.0|This is a stellar year for the prog community. Not one but two brilliant albums being released in the same year. One \\"Six Degree's of Inner Turbulence\\" by Dream Theater, and also this offering by Pain of Salvation.  Though I was at first a tad reluctant to admit it Remedy Lane is the better of the two albums.  Although not as fast nor as technical as the release by Dream Theater (though is album is both heavy and technical) for a continuous stream of great song writing after great song writing this album is tops. Full of emotion and excellent lyrics through.  Dare I even say that the brainchild of this band and lead singer Daniel Gildenlow is even a better vocalist then James LaBrie?  It's a close match but the man pours his heart and soul into songs such as \\"A Trace of Blood\\" (which deals with the pains of a miscarriage) and of course the feeling poured forth in \\"Undertow\\" and \\"Beyond the Pale\\" is equally as powerful.  For brilliant softer song you don't get much better then \\"Chain Sling\\" which features some great wacky vocal affects.  For beautiful love songs one of the best I've heard in a long time is \\"This Heart of Mine.\\"  This album comes heavily recommended and if you like me are starting out new with Pain of Salvation this album is perfect for starting with.  Take a walk down Remedy Lane and you'll not regret it.
B00005BCPC|2.0|I knew from reading previous reviews that this movie wasn't going to follow the book too closely, but I was surprised at how vastly different the movie was from the book. The main points of the book are pretty much the same in the movie, following a similar order of events. But I was disappointed to find so large a variation from the novel. My biggest problem with the movie was that everyone's personality was so different from what was in writing. Fanny is definitely not at all like the Fanny Price of the novel. Instead of the quiet and shy woman you find in the novel, she's outspoken and bold and somewhat too headstrong and rebellious for my liking. Some people may find this version of Fanny more appealing, but I must admit that I love the sweet and shy Fanny from the novel so much better. I did not enjoy the movie's portrayals of Lord and Lady Bertram either; their respective vices and quirks were greatly exaggerated, leading to very hateable and annoying people. I also found the over-emphasis on the dealings in Antigua was very distracting and unnecessary in moving the movie along. Overall, it was a very disappointing movie because of its apparent unfaithfulness to the wonderful novel that Jane Austen wrote. My suggestion - just read the book over again. At least that will bring all kinds of happiness and satisfaction.
0375703764|3.0|so this book is really well written in parts, and its nice, fun all that makes you flip back and forth like dfw which is annoying cause you need two or three bookmarks, but thats ok, cause usually the writing is ok, basically if you like, well, you know youll like this book if youre buying it so reading reviews is pointless, i just beleive that people who are really impressed with this book haven't read much, like i mean much of the book is just like other books, like pale fire, or the third policeman or even borges, heck the whole minotaur thing and labryinths hmmm where'd he get that idea, and yeah you need to read the third policeman right now if you like this book, but who cares if the ideas arent his its still well written and kinda fun kinda annoying so middle , three stars not bad but to be honest i wish id spent my time reading something else like, if i was gonna read something for fun i just wish it woulda paid off.oh well, tough luck.
0812550706|5.0|I enjoy science fiction. I like the situations and possibilities that one can only find in the genre. That said, 'Ender's Game' is striking. Having just finished it today, it is easily one of the top ten books I have ever read. It has all the trappings of sci-fi yes... space travel, techno-gizmo, other planets, aliens, future societies. But it is in the end a human story. Ender is destined to be the savior for the human race. He begins the story at six years old, the third child in an age where population control results in a two child maximum. His brother and sister had the ability, but it must be him that will have the personality. He is humanity's last hope, and Card takes us on the journey through his eyes, though his heart.<br />I look to books for entertainment in a form that music and books can't give me. An enjoyable, quick read. But Ender's story caused me to rethink alot of my opinions about alot of things. To question my beliefs about meaning in my life, even. For Ender to make it, he will have to endure a terrible life... one of isolation, lonelyiness, despair. There are many people, important people, who are interested in him. But no one to comfort him, befriend him, confide with him. What the military puts him through would be considered criminal by today's standards. He is denied a childhood, and barred from any type of postive emotion attachment.<br />There is a reason that this book has still has such a following nearly twenty years after it was first published. By the time it nears 40, I am sure it will have taken it's place among '20,000 Leagues Under the Sea,' '1984,' 'Stranger in a Strange Land,' 'Rendezvous with Rama,' 'Farenheight 451,' 'Foundation,' and 'Dune.'

B00005A46T|3.0|These guys are freaks, plain and simple. If you have seen their music video \\"Left Behind\\" then you know what I mean. In the video, they were freakish masks that are easily more disturbibg looking then a lot of things you've seen in movies. <br />However, bands like Mushroomhead have worn masks way before Slipknot, so they are probably just copying. <br />As for their music, it's VERY loud. Every song is full of screaming and loud music. It basically never changes. You would think that a nine-person band would have more variety, but they don't.<br />The lyrics are just sickening. Take all the negativity of most rock bands you hear and put it together, and then you will know what I mean...<br />Why do these guys gotta shout out these horrible lyrics??? What are they so angry about? They probably make tons of money, yet they sit their and scream their heads off about how they hate everything, hate life, etc. If you ask me, these guys are just trying to put on some insane image, nothing more...<br />But then again, despite the sickening lyrics and repetetive music, some of their songs are pretty good. People=S*** is very awesome song. <br />In the end, the album is a little on the repetitive side and their lyrics are way too disturbing, however, some of their songs ARE pretty good but it's probably not enough to make you buy the album.
B0000057C5|5.0|Standing strong as one of my favorite albums of all time, 'Sehnsucht' is a blistering aural assault of industrial death metal. Musically, this 6 piece German outfit is magnificent. They are truly at the high end of their genre. The complexity and intensity of their guitar work is astound more noteably in songs like \\"Eifersucht\\" (Jealosy) and \\"Tier\\" (Beast). Flake is one of the best keyboardests that I have ever seen, he brings out the true emotion in \\"Klavier\\" (Piano) and creates some very \\"Technoy\\" types parts like in \\"Engle\\" (Angel), I mean, the synthesizer breakdown in the middle of it, it was just amazing. And no to mention all of the samples in \\"Kuss Mich (Fellfroch)\\" (Kiss Me (Furryfog). Vocally, the album just screams emotion. Till really knows what he is doing. His growls and singing make the lyrics (all in German) a real \\"treat\\". Lyrically, this an extreamly messed up album (just like their others). Here is a quick breakdown; \\"Sehnsucht\\" (Hunger / Longing), losing your virginity. \\"Engle\\" (Angel) (my second favorite song), depising angels. \\"Tier\\" (Beast), incest. \\"Bestrafe Mich\\" (Punish Me), final judgement, \\"Du Hast\\" (You Hate / You Have), a some-what joke song about relationships. \\"Bück Dich\\" (Bend Down), homosexual rape (this song got them banned in Boston, New York, and Chicago (they \\"simulated\\" it during their preformances)), \\"Spiel Mit Mir\\" (Play With Me), a song about being close to somebody (and I mean REAL close), \\"Klavier\\" (Piano) (my favorite song), about falling in love with somebody, then killing them. \\"Alter Mann\\" (Old Man), about aging. \\"Eifersucht\\" (Jealosy) (my third favorite), about becoming so jealious that you will kill. \\"Kuss Mich (Fellfrosch)\\" (Kiss Me (Furryfrog)) (My other favorite), a song abuot a girl who just wants sex (the second lyrical line is \\"To be fingered is all she wants...\\") [Note: Furryfrog a slag term for a vagina in Germany]. All in all, this is one of my favorite albums of all time. It all just comes together in one big Industrial Metal package. A must have. No ifs, ans, or buts...<br />-MC
B00000K413|5.0|This is Tears For Fears debut album and what a debut. It primarily has that typical early 1980s New Wave to it except this album is far FAR above most of that ... 80s fluff and has far more poetic lyrics. The Hurting is dark and yet daytime sounding at the same time. Basically it has an apocolyptic feel lyrically as is shone on 'Start Of The Breakdown' and 'Mad World'.<br />The edition I'm reviewing is the remastered edition with four bonus tracks.<br />It's hard for me to explain the tracks in detail but I can say this CD is great and is a must have for any 80s lover like myself.<br />The term '... 80s fluff' I mentioned earlier does not necessarily mean I don't like 80s music. Contrarily I love 80s music. Just that I tend to enjoy some of the lesser known 80s hits.<br />Hurting is much lighter and less heavy than its successor 'Songs From The Big Chair' and is much more synth pop than 'The Seeds Of Love'. It seems strange that this album is from the same band who would eventually evolve from a synth-pop group into a more soul-rock sounding group with that 1989 masterpiece.<br />This Cd had little notice here in the US when it came out in 1983 but it did well in England. Tears For Fears would have two year to go before setting the charts on fire in 1984 with 'Shout' and again in 1985 with EWTRTW(The name is so long I sometimes don't feeling like typing out the whole name).<br />Unlike the bonus tracks in The Big Chair and Seeds Of Love the bonuc tracks while good kind of dissapointed me a smidgey bit. The World Remix of Mad World is dead identical to the original version except with a more echoing beat. This version is still good.<br />The other three are good to excellent. The Way You Are on here is extended to almost 8 minutes long. I love the extended versions of Pale Shelter and Change. The extended verison of Mad World has a less metallic beat and the beat is more flat. The version of Change is extended to six minutes for more listening pleasure.<br />My favorite track besides the bonus tracks is 'Start Of The Breakdown'. This song is like the blueprint of what was to come on The Big Chair and this song could have fit well on that album.<br />This CD is worth having if you love Tears For Fears but I would start with The Big Chair and The Seeds Of Love. Then I would get this one. Oh what the hell get all of TFFs albums.My favorite track besides the bonus tracks is 'Start Of The Breakdown'.

0385335482|4.0|This novel follows the Brit singleton formula that has developed from Helen Fielding's \\"Bridget Jones' Diary\\". It's the closest novel I've read to the two Bridget Jones' novels.<br />It makes for a great beach read and pageturner. You know that the tribulations of Becca Bloomwood will turn around-- and they do very quickly. High marks for making Luke Brandon an appealing and mysterious character.<br />My main problems with 'Confessions' are its predictable and unrealistic plot. But this is a charming story with a tight plot; I couldn't put it down. If you want to laugh uproarously about someone's shopping sprees and credit card woes this is the story. I look forward to reading more novels by Sophie Kinsella.
1573225517|3.0|High Fidelity is a brief insight into the life of a British man obsessed by music and his love life. When Rob's girlfriend initially breaks up with him the first thing he does is reorganize his enormous record collection. He is so over whelmed by the power of pop culture that his vision of where his record collection ends and his relationship begins is clouded.  Directly after his break up with Laura his girlfriend, he plunges himself into a reflection of his life. He looks back at his all time top five break ups and in the story we see him look up his girlfriends from the past, as he searches for where he could have possibly gone wrong. Throughout all of these encounters Rob is hilarious. One question comes to mind, Do all guys act and feel the same as Rob? The situations he engages in are so funny and at times they even make you embarrassed . All in all, High Fidelity is a wonderful novel! I would recommend it to anyone who is interested in how men think and act, and anyone that is in need of some good humor.
B000063DS1|5.0|I had heard the entire Last Waltz concert as an unmixed bootleg recording before, so I was excited when I heard it would be released by Rhino as a commercially-mixed 4-CD set.  It's all here, the entire show from Thanksgiving 1976, complete with jam sessions, restored and uncut tunes, and even rehearsal recordings.  The entire show has been re-mixed and includes 16 previously unreleased live tracks, five songs from the rehearsal, plus some studio ideas and experiments which ultimately became the &quot;Last Waltz Suite.&quot;  <br />Highlights include the version of &quot;The Weight&quot; with The Staples Singers that was filmed and recorded for the movie (a much more soulful version than the one included on the original album), a live version of the great song &quot;Acadian Driftwood,&quot; and rehearsal recordings of Van Morrison doing his two numbers, &quot;Tura-Lura-Lural&quot; and &quot;Caravan.&quot;  <br />Hell, the entire box set is worth getting just for Van doing &quot;Caravan.&quot;  I am a Van connoisseur (I've got hundreds of live Van recordings) and this was by far his most soulful performance EVER.  The horn section complements the song wonderfully.<br />Packaging is tasteful and comes with a booklet including a short essay by Robbie Robertson, fantastic photographs, and a longer essay by David Fricke about the band, the concert, and the movie.  <br />Look, if you like the movie and want to buy the original, 2-CD soundtrack, go right ahead; it's terrific.  But you might want to save yourself some money and buy this box set instead, because once you hear the 2-disc soundtrack, you're gonna get thirsty for more.
B000001EYW|5.0|The songs on this CD are either very beautful, very catchy, or a combination of the two!!  I can listen to this for hours and still want to hear it more!  It is &quot;the sweetest thing,&quot; (words from &quot;Still Waters).
B000002OMN|3.0|I absolutely LOVED &quot;Life is a lemon.....&quot; so I went and ordered the CD, but the songs aren't that great. A bit cheesy, but Rock and Roll Dreams was well....cute. :)<BR>I don't regret getting this CD just for Life is a Lemon.
B0000024ZI|5.0|Released in 1972 debuting on Columbia Records, &quot;All The Young Dudes&quot; was David Bowie's attempt to save this band from demise. Bowie wrote the title track &quot;All The Young Dudes&quot; for Mott and it became a hit for them, thus saving them from breaking up. The entire album (or cd in this case) is a gem of cleaverly written songs, some by Bowie, Lou Reed and Mott members Ian Hunter,Mick Ralphs, Verdon Allen and Overend Watts. This l.p. represents a more mature Mott than, say their previous releases. Songs such as &quot;Jerkin Crokus&quot;, &quot;Mamas Little Jewel&quot;,&quot;One Of The Boys&quot;, and &quot;Ready For Love&quot; show the creativity of the band. Ian Hunter's Dylanish voice is certainly up to par on this release as is guitarist Mick Ralphs guitar licks. Mott The Hoople was part of the glam rock scene that was emerging in England. Groups such as Bowie &amp; his Spiders From Mars, T-Rex and The Sweet were some of the top glam groups at that time. This is one of those albums that seems to never grow old, but betters with age. A definate must for classic rock aficianados. Highly recommended!
B000002I25|5.0|His formative years having been in the late 1960s and early 1970s, my oldest brother still listens to music from that time period. Since I mainly enjoy classical and opera, it took many years of listening to and reading about The Doors to really appreciate the band myself. <br />As German composer Richard Wagner transformed opera into a purging experience in the manner of ancient Greek tragedy (rather than a gathering for polite chit-chat among the upper class), Jim Morrison used \\"Rock and Roll\\" in the same manner. Morrison was also familiar with the works of German philosopher Friedrich Nietzsche, a friend of Wagner's until their falling out over the composer's nationalism. (Is it mere coincidence that both Wagner and The Doors appeared in \\"Apocalypse Now?\\")<br />To create its timeless music, the Doors did not limit itself to a diligently \\"Rock\\" sound. As a result, the music transcends genre. The Doors evokes the Blues in a few songs, and even performs a song from Kurt Weill`s seedy opera \\"The Rise of Fall of the City of Mahogenny.\\" Morrison despised the idea of cranking out commercially-acceptable schlock, and ultimately grew weary of fans expecting the Lizard King to \\"top himself.\\" <br />The Doors may sound like it's from the 1960s, but it does not reek as much of the decade as other bands. One is less likely to tire of the Doors' magic since it has yet to be tamed into \\"soothing\\" muzak at retail and grocery stores, or used as background music in commercials encouraging Baby Boomers to buy overpriced cars. Morrison is too dangerous for such a thing, speaking as a shaman from the recesses of the unconscious. From \\"Break on Through to the Other Side\\" to \\"The End,\\" the Doors' premiere album evokes a seductively nocturnal atmosphere. Nearly all the songs are actually memorable, including the ever-popular \\"Light My Fire,\\" with Morrison's sexually urgent shout of the song's final \\"fire;\\" the Bluesy \\"Back Door Man\\" with its titular innuendo; the dimly sensuous dreamscapes evoked in \\"Crystal Ship\\" and \\"End of the Night;\\" and the mesmerizing Oedipal cataclysm \\"The End.\\"<br />As it pushes 40, The Doors' premiere album retains its darkly seductive magic. The Doors' music does indeed \\"rock on\\" as other music fads fade into the past: the addle-pated odes to surfing, cars, and surfing in cars during the `60s; the overly-mellow musings of the burned-out early `70s; the coked-up phony cosmopolitanism of the `80s; and the attack of the Kurt Cobain clones during the `90s. It's a shame that few bands don't even attempt to move adventurously beyond the confines of their genres (as Metallica did when it performed with the San Francisco Symphony) or to actively acknowledge Rock's debt to its African American origins (as Jimi Hendrix did with his magical guitar-playing). It's also a shame that few bands draw upon a catholic array of literary, musical, and artistic resources for inspiration, and cling desperately to corporate conceptions of what \\"the youth market\\" allegedly wants. The Doors was not afraid to experiment, and for this reason the Doors' revelatory music will haunt us for generations to come.

0062502182|5.0|I don't understand how someone could have read this book and given it anything less than 5 stars.  Yes, it wasn't long and it wasn't a challenging read... but it was truly a beautiful and exhilarating story.<br />&quot;New Age&quot;?  No, I don't think so at all.  I don't think it's any more new age than any number of business strategy books I've been reading lately or any books about starting your own company.<br />The story is a saga about achieving your personal dream... and dreaming in general.  Most people these days are too busy to dream or to listen to their dreams... they're like the crystal merchant and the baker in this story.  But somewhere, deep down, all of us wish we were just a bit like the shepherd... strong enough (with a bit of wanderlust) to leave the assurances of stationary life and go searching for our dreams.<br />Also, if the religious/alchemist part of the story gets you interested in learning more, I highly recommend trying to find a copy of Riddle of the Sphinx by Jay Williams.
B0000041Q3|4.0|There is one simple but compelling reason to make the Sutherland-Mehta recording your first, and possibly only, &quot;Turandot&quot;, whatever the set's shortcomings - and I think there undeniably are some - may be: Joan Sutherland is the only Turandot in a complete recording to sing the role consistently on pitch. No other Turandot in a complete version that I've heard - and I've heard many, including Nilsson, Callas, Marton, you name it - accomplishes this feat. Nilsson, probably the most famous Turandot of the twentieth century, who recorded the role commercially twice and whose interpretation is available on several live recordings as well, veers audibly off the note numerous times in all her performances, including ones recorded under ideal &quot;studio&quot; conditions. Callas neither stays on pitch nor can manage the high climaxes comfortably. Marton might have been able to sing all the notes if recorded in her prime in a studio, but her first recording was done live, and her second version is from well past her vocal youth. Caballe comes in perhaps second to Sutherland in reliability, but she lacks Sutherland's laser-like accuracy. In my experience, only Dame Eve Turner, the leading Turandot of the 1930s, equalled (and possibly exceeded) Sutherland's vocal accomplishment in this role - she doesn't scoop up to the notes, for example, as Sutherland sometimes does - but Turner never recorded the opera complete.<BR>This is not to say that the Sutherland-Mehta recording, or even Sutherland's own performance, is perfect. In addition to the occasional scooping up to the notes just mentioned (but at least the notes she scoops up to are the right ones!) Sutherland never sang the role in an opera house, and her interpretation lacks the bite, even savagery, that, in their different ways, Callas and Nilsson brought to the part. And Sutherland was never the most detailed or emotional of singers, though she does manage to sing more expressively here, under Mehta, than sheoften managed under her husband, Richard Bonynge, who conducted almost all her studio recordings. Pavarotti, though, is a sublime Calaf, and Caballe is a vocally secure, though not particularly individual, Liu. (For more moving renditions of this role, listen to Magda Olivero on the vintage Gina Cigna recording, or to Leontyne Price on pirated performances). <BR>But, given the chance that the Sutherland-Mehta set affords us to hear Puccini's fascinating writing for the title character as he wrote it (and surely hoped it would one day be sung), buy this recording.
B000062YAZ|5.0|Brutal is the only word that can accurately describe this album.  Reign In Blood almost single handedly inspired the genre of death metal on the American side of the Atlantic, which is a testament to how heavy this album is.  Even by today's standards, this is one extremely heavy album, which goes to show how it sounded back in 1986.  Slayer's first 2 albums only hinted at their potential, but Reign In Blood was the one that brought that potential out in full force, and in very convincing fashion.  While most will dismiss Reign In Blood as merely a wall of noise, one needs to truly appreciate the thrash style to decipher all that makes this album a classic.  The musicianship on this album is absolutely amazing.  No band could possibly top this record because no band can play that damn fast and still be precise, a quality that makes Slayer one of my favorite bands.  The lyrics are a mixed bag.  Some of the songs are very convincing, while others come off as being a little silly at times, but despite this, there are no weak tracks to be found.  The total package, however, is an undisputed classic.  Kerry King and Jeff Hanneman are in top form on this record, busting out punishing and memorable riffs that they've never been able to top, especially on tracks like \\"Angel Of Death\\" and \\"Raining Blood.\\"  Tom Araya is also at the top of his game vocally, while Dave Lombardo's drumming is flawless, albeit extremely exhausting, even when you aren't trying to replicate his thunderous double kick bass.  While future albums would feature better overall lyrical content and others would feature fantastic progressive musical composition, no album can match the total package of Reign In Blood.  This album embodies thrash more than Master Of Puppets ever could, which is why I truly believe this album to be the greatest thrash album of all time.
0446677450|4.0|Reading this book has made me realize I need to change the way I work and how I approach money.   I have recommended it to most of my frends.<br />This is not a book for seasoned investors, or for people who know a lot about running businesses and dealing with cashflow.  It is a book for a &quot;regular Joe&quot; who wants to take control of his or her financial future.<br />Robert's story unfolds converstationally, teaching you the things he learned the way he did - as a 9-year old who was given simple and basic ideas that began changing the way he looked at money.  Because of this, the elements he teaches are repeated often, incrementally building on one another.  They are taught in simple and broad terms that allow you to digest things slowly.  (Probably why most of the investors and business owners who have written reviews here have rated this book poorly.)<br />This is not a how-to book; it won't give you step-by-step instructions on building wealth and assets.  What it will do is point you down a path you've never seen before, and give you enough of a nudge that you'll want to explore it further.
B000002H97|3.0|Sometimes, I don't know what to think of this album.  Don't get me wrong, it's a very good album, but it's far from Metallica's best.  If you were expecting the menacing prog-thrash of old, this album will disappoint.  Not a hint of their thrash roots is to be heard.  All of the songs are much slower and the music is much less complex.  The riffs, however, are quite memorable, and the lyrics are excellent.  But something about this album is lacking.  Truth be told, this was the first Metallica album I bought, way back when I was still pretty young.  A few years later, though, I discovered their 80's albums, and I was absolutely blown away.  And the more I got into those early albums, the less impressed I started to become with the black album.  As I said before, it's not a bad album by any means, but it can't touch Master Of Puppets.  It seems almost lazy in comparison to their earlier work, and that's why I can't honestly say that this is one of their best albums.  While it's leaps and bounds beyond Load and Re-load, the first 4 records are in a league of their own, and even the black album can't touch them.
0871137380|5.0|As ex-military, I think every American should read &quot;Blackhawk Down&quot; by Mark Bowden. It's the true story of how the young men and women in the Armed Forces put their lives on the line. It tells you what they do, as seen through the example of a battle in Somalia. I highly recommend this book. And, taking the recommendation of another reader, I read &quot;West Point: Character, Leadership...&quot; by Norman Thomas Remick. Every American, especially worried Moms and Dads who have kids in the armed forces who are potentially in harms way, should read this book, also. It tells you why our noble young men and women in the armed forces do what they do. As a corollary to Mark Bowden's great book, &quot;Blackhawk Down&quot;, it's revealing and consoling.
B00005IC2H|5.0|The music sigur ros makes has such a unique sound that when compared to pop music it seems utterly alien (and I mean that in the outer space sense).the whole album just flows perfectly from one emotion to another from dispair to hope to tightly held in anger right into joy. the way it flows almost makes you feel like you are being led on a trip through someones mind while they have been loaded down with heroine. I would recomend this album to any one who enjoys ehtereal, emotional and cooled out relaxing music and is tired of everything pop. What an album to dream to.
B0000636UN|2.0|In an article at rollingstone.com Sheryl Crow complains about the recording process of her new album C'MON, C'MON as a \\"meltdown.\\" It seems turning 40 was hard on the poor thing. Whatever the cause, her fourth record has certainly missed the target. It is full of mostly forgettable songs with greeting card lyrics. Sure, there are some good rocking pop tunes like, \\"Steve McQueen,\\" \\"Soak Up the Sun,\\" and \\"Hole in My Pocket.\\" But these are the bastard children of songs like \\"Run, Baby, Run\\" and \\"All I Wanna Do.\\" Those songs from TUESDAY NIGHT MUSIC CLUB had not only effective pop hooks, but gut-grabbing, emotional lyrics. The bulk of the songs on C'MON, C'MON sound like the schmaltz pop and ersatz-country playing on commercial radio stations these days. Only occasionally do we get a glimpse of what this album could have been, like the beginning of \\"Over You\\" or the only sparkling gem \\"Weather Channel.\\" That song, the last on the album is an exploration of depression, and an achingly beautiful acoustic ballad punctuated by the always-tasteful backup vocals of Emmylou Harris. Harris knows how to underscore an artist's lead vocal and not overshadow it. Her presence on a song is usually cause for a closer listen. But the rest of the guest vocals (Stevie Nicks, Liz Phair, Natalie Maines, Lenny Kravitz, and unbelievably, Gwyneth Paltrow) here prove self-aggrandizing on the part of Crow. Like her SHERYL CROW & FRIENDS: LIVE IN CENTRAL PARK all the \\"guest\\" appearances feel like Crow is saying, \\"Hey, ain't I cool? Look at all the \\"famous\\" friends I have!\\" Only Harris' guest vocal has any real impact on the album. The worst is the Don Henley duet on the lame lounge-rock ballad \\"It's So Easy.\\" It took Crow two-and-half years to complete C'MON, C'MON, perhaps in another two-and-half she will have slid comfortably into her forties and produce another album that is the equal of her first three.
B00005JKL8|2.0|During the opening credits of `Behind Enemy Lines\\", I felt like I was watching a super slick recruitment ad for the United States Navy - the kind that seems to say that war used to be hell, but now it's fun. It turns out that first time director John Moore is an award-winning TV commercial director. His arsenal of flash filmy techniques is impressive, but it's not enough to save the movie from its banal, cartoon-like script.<br />Burnett [Owen Wilson] is among about a thousand pilots stuck on an aircraft carrier not far from the war front. Bored and frustrated by a conflict he doesn't understand, he decides to turn in his resignation. His superior officer, Admiral Reigert [Gene Hackman], is miffed by Burnett's decision and decides to pay him back by sending him on a routine mission on Christmas Day. Flying over a demilitarized zone, Burnett photographs something he wasn't supposed to see. In retaliation, Bosnian forces shoot the plane down. Reigert mounts a rescue mission, which is hampered by NATO commanders, who are negotiating a withdrawal from the war. Burnett is left on his own to escape, all the while being pursued by a vicious Bosnian sniper.<br />The hero goes from one bad situation to another. He's often saved only because this is one of those movies in which a hundred bad guys couldn't collectively hit the side of a barn door. The movie really does play like video game. Every time Burnett escapes a situation, he simply moves on the next game level. Consequently, there's never any genuine emotion, just a series of adrenaline rushes.<br />Wilson tries hard, but he can't overcome the fact that his character is so shallow, he might as well be the roadrunner from the famous old cartoons. Ironically, Wilson is himself an award-winning scriptwriter. Hackman has little to do except look gruff but fatherly and speak in old Hollywood cliches that are supposed to sound meaningful.<br />\\"Behind Enemy Lines\\" does succeed in the action department. The sequence where the jet is shot down is spectacular. A great deal of attention is paid to details in these scenes. Too bad the filmmakers forgot to pay attention to the script. [Note: In defense of the director, the studio allegedly forced him to edit his original \\"R\\" rated cut down to a \\"PG-13\\" version. It would be interesting to see if more than just some violent images wound up on the cutting room floor.]the jet is shot down is spectacular.

B00003W8NM|5.0|I've seen/own a diverse array of \\"great\\" films.  I own all the \\"greats\\" available on DVD.  This one, though, is the top of the heap.  <br />I only saw this film because EVERYONE who HAD seen it said it was their favorite.  It was one of those films that you keep putting off at the rental store, but feel you HAVE to get...  Well... eventually I ran out of interesting looking movies and rented this one.  I was VERY, VERY, VERY surprised.  This is now BY FAR MY FAVORITE MOVIE EVER...  <br />I have since showed/told about the film to at least 50 people that I know.  All but three of them liked it.  Most of the remaining people said it was the best film they'd ever seen.  The ONLY people who did hate it were girls, but most girls liked it.  Hope that helps...<br />Anyway, you'll be surprised.  The second disc, the one with the features, is PACKED with goodies... for example... it shows little inside jokes in the movie...  Remember when Ed Norton (in the beginning of the movie) is sitting in his hotel room talking about \\"single serving mints, single serving... single serving...\\" then it shows the TV with all the waiters saying \\"welcome.\\" Look on the FAR RIGHT of the waiters... Ah, waddia know?  Tyler Durden!  It's the hotel where he works!!!  <br />This is a VERY nice \\"DVD\\" as in well programmed, JAMMED with goodies.. in the caliber (as far as having good features) of The Matrix, or SHREK... this thing is JAMMED... the DVD is worth it, and the CASE is a work of art!  Honest!  ~Andy
B0000029DD|5.0|at the risk of sounding like a complete flake, i will say that this album effected me on a very deep level.  it made possible the release of emotions i don't think i would otherwise been able to really deal with.  i don't listen to it any more, this music is inside me.<br />my apologies to all you cynics.  you simply can't be cynical in this face of this music.
B00003CXI1|1.0|This movie is missing everything that is loved by readers of the book. Despite the fact that comign up wiht unknown actors who were British sounded like a good idea, the kids just don't cut it. The script is lacking some of the better moments of the book, and the subtelties that the book had are losed in the movie. The emotion is all gone in a movie that was made mostly for money. If you want it, rent it. But read the books first.
0201626632|4.0|This book should be standard issue to graduate students (and any PhD who did not get it graduate school).  It's a reminder that sheer brain power alone is not sufficient to be a successful scientist.  It's also important to have a research plan and be able to articulate that plan.  Indeed, the central theme of the book is the importance of communication at levels of a science career (talks, papers, grants, interviews, etc.).  His guidelines for paper writing and giving talks are especially fine.  Feibelman is a solid state physicist, but nearly everything he says was equally applicable to my field (astronomy).<br />I didn't give this excellent book five stars because it is such a short book, and short on concrete detail and example.  If you're serious about the issues discussed in the book, you'll want to pick up one or more related books out there (which often cite this one positively, by the way).  Don't skip this one, though.  You can read it in a hour or two every few years as a reminder/checklist about what you should be doing.
B000060K4O|5.0|The best movie in the world is Ghostbusters without a doubt, and to compliment this movie so well the DVD is amazing. The MST3k style commentary is impressive and hillarious. The amount of effort, and things included on this DVD is amazing. When it was released in 1999 is was the most advanced DVD around and that can still be said. If this isn't in your collection, buy it now!
B00005YXZH|3.0|This is an interesting record. One that nearly didn't see the light of day, but I can see why Reprise's suits rebelled against it. I quite like it, but the only standout tracks (so far, to me) are Jesus, Etc., (with a great violin line, subsequently echoes with a MIDI voice), Ashes Of American Flags (with a great chaotic ending) and Pot Kettle Black. What I find amusing, as an old guy, is the combination of wispy, rather undistinguished songs with all the clattering off-the-wall 'effects', mostly MIDI voices and Moog, and maybe some theremin, plus plentiful samples and radio static.<br />This record may strike younger ears as something very original, but it sounds very 60s/early 70s to me, and even, dare I say it, Pink Floydish? The guitar soloing on I'm The Man Who Loves You is so relentlessly awful, perhaps intentionally, that it reminds me of the 'stoned 13 year old brother in the garage', and the brass is pure Electric Flag vulgar.<br />It's certainly an interesting CD, but 'the New Sgt. Pepper' it ain't. We used to call this kind of effort 'bold experimentation' at the time, until, tiring of too much of it, we called it 'boring pretention,' and swept it away with punk rock.<br />I'm not trying to box Wilco into some 'alt country' niche, but they can do, and have done, better than this.
B00000099Y|5.0|This is without a doubt Tool's best album.  It is much more adventurous and beautiful than &quot;Undertow&quot; and more varied and complex than &quot;Lateralus.&quot;  I do like &quot;Lateralus&quot; a lot, but the lyrics are too positive and preachy at times.  Also, I feel that on &quot;Aenima&quot;, the beauty of Maynard's voice totally at equilibrium with the ferocity of the music.  And one more thing, I am sick of everyone whining about the &quot;filler&quot; tracks on this album.  If you don't want to listen to them then just skip over them like I do and you are still left with many long songs that are Tool's best.
B00003CXRP|3.0|Cast Away is a good film, but not one that stays with for long.  Tom Hanks plays the part well (he must be the actor of the decade) but the movie just lacks that little extra to lift it above the ordinary. The DVD is a nice compilation but the making of this movie just didn't inspire me.  An enjoyable movie but one I'm not likely to see again or keep in my DVD collection.
B00004LN16|2.0|AC/DC has a secret that they have to selling a shizbot or records: They keep putting the same songs on every album.  So good reviewers, are you really that immersed in your AC/DC fandom?  And fans who put in bad reviews, why are you surprised?  Every album is the same album, people.  Trust me, this is the case.  Not to mention that Angus is a very overrated guitar player.  Anyway, don't be surprised that this album lacks originality, because the only original one was the first one.
B00005U2LM|5.0|Well, alot of people didn't like the last Wu-Tang album, the W, mainly because some of the beats [were bad]. The Iron Flag has smoother flashier beats courtesy of RZA and other producers. Ghostface Killah only rhymes on a couple of songs, Raekwon, GZA, Method Man and U-God turn in the best performances for the clan. Ol' Dirty Bastard who is in prison serving a 2 to 4 prison sentence didn't get to record on Iron Flag so crazy Public Enemy rapper Flavor Flav guests on Soul Power, since he is crazy and just giving shout outs on the song, he sort of replaces ODB's maniac energy. Overall the Iron Flag has good beatsm good rhymes by the clan, so it's much better than The W.
B00005JKL8|4.0|In my past reviews here on Amazom.com I said great things about actors such as deniro, picino, reeves, walken,...but for got to mention Gene Hackman, I must be [dumb]! He is another hollywood legend and to mark another notch in this belt with this movie! If you haven't see this one get ready for a ride! Of cource there some holes, but what movie is totally perfect, very few. Watch for the football section in the water and listen for \\"Wilson!\\" (Cast Away) If want action from begining to end with a good story and message about living here in the greatest country on the planet, than buy this one to add to your collection!!
B00005YW4H|5.0|I love when I take a chance on a cd and come out a winner.  I must've picked this cd up a million times one beautiful April afternoon before I decided to purchase it.  I'd never heard of Norah Jones. I'd never seen a record review, nor seen her perform live.  I found the cd at a store with one of those &quot;listening booths&quot; and after previewing a couple of tracks I headed for the checkout counter.  I got home, popped in the cd and was really impressed.  I don't know how to describe her voice, take part Shelby Lynne, the sweetness of Olivia Newton-John and the style of Phoebe Snow and you almost have her down.....but there's something more....she's the type of singer that can take a silly song and make it sound great.....and you don't want to skip any tracks.....you turn the music on, pour a glass of your favorite beverage and relax......from the opening track &quot;Don't Know Why&quot; to the FANTASTIC cover of &quot;The Nearness of You&quot;.....this one's a winner.  I can't wait to hear more from this artist......I think I'm in love!
B00005YXZH|5.0|..lots of talk out there about this being a classic, a must own, one of the best albums to come out in ten years, on par with the white album, the kid a of alt-country...<br />...sigh...alright, let me try and gather myself...<br />upon the first few listens I didn't think much of this album. That's not saying much, because usually great albums do not reveal themselves in the first few listens. The album is rather soft throughout...it starts out rather minimalistic in instrumentation with the background noise driven \\"I am trying to break your heart\\". Tweedy's voice blares out, distinct amoungst the sparseness of the surrounding bass line and (awesome) drum-riff. It's a powerful song when you give it the time. The album picks up a bit, getting (almost) poppy on \\"Kamera\\" and then later on \\"War on War\\", \\"Heavy Metal Drummer\\", and \\"Pot Kettle Black\\", but stays rather somber throughout. \\"Radio Cure\\" relies heavily on Tweedy's voice as it's centerpoint, with Microphones-ish bass-drum and guitar rising and falling every few seconds. The highlight here in my opinion is \\"Poor Places\\", the piano is simply beautiful as it twirls with Tweedy's sad/optimistic lyrical sway.<br />This isn't typical Wilco faire, but that shouldn't detract from the experience. The band seems much more interested in post-production and song as experience, instead of churning out catchy hook driven music with a few ballads thrown in, as they've done in the past.
B00005R2M3|3.0|As a lyricist, Ms. Shakira makes a great pop singer.....but the production is well done and the tracks are memorable. This cd will probaly collect dust on my shelf after I grow tired of it, but for right now....it's not a bad time passer.  Not a classic, but perhaps the first in many English language hit cds for Shakira.
0393317552|5.0|If you haven't read this book, you are in for a treat.  This is the kind of book about which it can truly be said, I have only one regret, and that's that I've already read it!  Or--even though the narrative runs to 426 pages--when one gets to the end, one wishes there were more.  I'm trying to think if I've ever read anything comparable.  In terms of scope, pure readability, interesting information, delicious ideas, a compelling thesis, worldly wisdom, etc., I can think of nothing.  The closest would be something by Marvin Harris.<br />Professor Diamond begins by rephrasing a question asked of him by a New Guinea man in 1972, \\"Why did wealth and power become distributed as they now are, rather than in some other way?  For instance, why weren't Native Americans, Africans, and Aboriginal Australians the ones who decimated, subjugated, or exterminated Europeans and Asians?\\" (p. 15)  A stunning question really.  And Diamond answers it fully and in such a manner that there can be little doubt that he is substantially right.  The answer of course is presented in the title, \\"Guns, Germs, and Steel.\\"  How did the Conquistadors conquer the Aztecs and the Incas with a few score of soldiers against masses of resistence numbered in the tens of thousands?  And how did the Europeans follow that up with the subjagation of the entire New World?  In the first case, the answer is guns, horses and steel, and in the second case mostly germs, and mostly smallpox, a disease to which the Europeans had immunity because of their long association with cattle from which the disease evolved, while the Native peoples of North and South America had no such experience and no immunity.  The fact that the first domesticated herd animals were from the old world and not the new is from the purely human point of view an \\"accident\\" of history and geography.  Consequently, we can see that it was not the \\"superior\\" European culture that made the difference, but the factors named above and, I must say, pure chance.<br />For those critical of this book I think it should be appreciated that this is not a history as such.  It is a work more akin to anthropology or ethnology.  Jared Diamond is a physiologist, so it should also be appreciated that none of this has any pretense to be original research.  What Diamond set out to do, and did remarkably well in my opinion, is to explain for a general, educated readership in detail just why the cultural history of the world developed the way it did.  This is emphatically not a work for scholars or scientists (although many have read the book with pleasure and have learned from it).<br />And it is not a perfect book.  The narrative is indeed uneven in parts, but this is a long, ambitious book, covering a lot of ground, so Professor Diamond may be forgiven for the occasional nod.  His much contended statement that New Guineans are smarter than Europeans is a miss statement, of course.  He should have simply said \\"as smart\\" (or as dumb, depending on your point of view), and left it at that.  By the way, on page 408 he admits the statement is a \\"subjective impression\\" and can be contested.  And yes, the book tends to the political correct, but I suspect that Diamond wrote it that way to anticipate and put aside such questions so that his main arguments might be appreciated without distraction.  If you write anything politically incorrect in this day and age, there is the very real chance that the politically incorrect statement will attract all the attention and the rest of your book be ignored.<br />And it is true that some of his substantive arguments--for example, the north-south axis of the American continents working against the spread of plants and knowledge--may be in error.  (I sure don't know.)  Or the idea that the indented coastline and connectness of Europe and China led to cultural advantage may be wrong.  However, even if Diamond is somewhat awry the mark here, his arguments are interesting and stimulating; and forthose who want to know more he gives suggestions for further reading near the back of the book.  The fact that Diamond brought these ideas and others to a large readership is a positive thing in itself.  Whether they are correct or not is not proven, of course, and indeed we can be sure that some of the ideas are wrong.  But this is to be expected.  Our knowledge of the world and how we came to be the way we are is an ever changing, every growing phenomenon.  Diamond's book cannot be properly judged yet, but will stand naked after, say, another generation of scientific and scholarly progress has passed.  At that time it will be interesting to compare his arguments with what is known and see where he was substantially correct and where he wasn't.  For now I think the bottom line on this remarkable work is to just enjoy it, learn from it, and let it stimulate your mind, and take it from there.r those who want to know more he gives suggestions for further reading near the back of the book.

B0000024WN|5.0|Paul Rothchild (Doors' producer) came along at just the right time to produce this classic and historic work, which was Janis' last album, released posthumously after her tragic and premature departure from the planet. \\"Me and Bobby McGee\\" never ceases to amaze me, especially when she delivers the word \\"nuthin\\" after singing the famous line, \\"freedom's just another word for nothin' left to lose.\\" The way she says \\"nuthin\\" is just so flat-out REAL, you know she's speaking to you straight from her bones. (The acoustic demo of this song is available on the 3-CD box set, which sheds light on how Janis single-handedly created the blueprint for this track, just her and her guitar). \\"My Baby\\" is gospel-like and redemptive, and is my favorite song on the \\"Pearl\\" album. It's as though her voice is a gateway into another realm and sends chills thru the body. \\"Cry Baby\\" is also one of Janis' most amazing vocal performances. (I like the alternate version of \\"Cry Baby\\" available on the 3-CD box set even better, because it captures some interesting moments of spontaneity and laughter in the studio, along with a very amusing rap midway thru the song.)<br />What many people don't realize about Janis is that she wrote some of her own (and best) material. \\"Move Over\\" is a Janis original and rocks as hard as anything she ever recorded. She sang this song on the Dick Cavett show right before her infamous high school reunion in Port Arthur.<br />She also performed \\"Get It While You Can\\" on the same show, which is as much of an anthem as any song she recorded. The line, \\"we may not be here tomorrow,\\" is all too prophetic. And the instrumental track of the ironic \\"Buried Alive in the Blues\\" is hard to listen for all the obvious reasons because Janis is conspicuous by her absence. (She was scheduled to finish the vocals for this Nick Gravenites tune the day she was found dead from an accidental overdose in her hotel room. The juxtaposition of the uptempo, happy beat of \\"Buried Alive in theBlues\\" is at odds with the circumstances, but it is a fitting tribute that it was included on the album, and a stark reminder that Janis was truly a force of nature and an highly exuberant (and joyous) personality, even when missing in action.)<br /> ... \\"Pearl\\" is rock 'n' roll history, a must for every record collection. There will always be a bummer element to this album because of the association of her death, but her energy and brilliance rock on and shine on, none the less. All praise to Janis---Legend, icon, pioneer---the late, the great Janis Joplin, still-reigning queen of rock.

B000053VAF|1.0|I've always been a fan of Smith's movies.  I was looking forward to seeing Dogma, especially curious around all the controversy.  I wish I could say I was offended, but instead, I just didn't get it nor think it was funny.  It was just one run on sentace of a joke that I never got to begin with.  Maybe it's because I didn't grow up with the Jesus religion, and instead grew up with the old testament and torah.  My catholic friend's who disliked Catholic school liked it, but again, I felt it was their inside joke that I was on the outside of.  I look forward to seeing the next one Kevin.  thank you.
1573225517|5.0|I read Nick Hornby's  book High Fidelity which is a comedic book about a guy named Rob who has recently come out of a fairly long relationship.  Rob analyzes his past relationships and tries to figure what everything means. From a girls point of view, this book gives you a look at how guys think and deal with relationships.  Guys I'm sure will like it because they may have had similar experiences like Rob.  I saw the movie before I read the book and I liked them both. However I think that the book is more detailed and funnier.
B000051VWW|5.0|I remember first hearing Sade back in the 80's, loving her smooth and jazzy voice then.  Today, I still love her voice and she's still got the magic to woo you and chill you at the same time.
B000060K4O|5.0|\\"Ghostbusters\\" is the ultimate special effects comedy. Its concept is great, and the execution is classic; you simply don't see this kind of innovation in this type of film anymore. I could watch it 100 times and still be entertained by its infectious spirit and hilarious performances (particularly from Murray, in his best role ever).<br />I'd rank the DVD as one of my favorites as well. Contrary to a previous reviewer, I have never experienced any problems with the disc, nor have I heard of any (and I'm in the video retail business). It gives you a full package, with lots of fun stuff worth revisiting over and over again, just like this great film.
B00005QW5X|5.0|Not a fan of musical's, then this movie is for you.  Even my dad loved it.  what else can I say.  The story of Hedwig is great; sad and funny at the sametime.  It's visually beautiful and the songs are actually fun and catchy.  Enjoy!
B00003CXI0|5.0|I am 15 and i really enjoyed the Harry Potter movie. I am a fan of the books along with my sister, who saw the movie and was also enthusiastic about it afterwards. I believe it can be enjoyed by all ages even though it is directed at a younger target audience. When i saw it with my mum, i could hear her laugh sometimes and my nanna said with excitement that it was great.<br />The movie is faithful to the book, without losing the magic and anticipation of it.  Some parts are changed or embellished, but I found that it made the movie more interesting, i didn't know every little thing that was going to happen. It was also fun to see parts that I knew from the book acted out on the big screen, and there were no dissapointments at those parts.
B00005J6UP|5.0|One of my favorite movies since it came out and I still enjoy watching it.  It's a wonderful movie even for kids today.
B00003CXRP|1.0|As someone who is fond of the South Pacific and the ocean in general, I was sure there would be something about this film that I might like. While there were some intriguing sequences of Tom Hanks trying to escape through a desolate island through the surf, the rest of the movie and the overall plot was so terribly corny that I left the theatre wishing I hadn't thrown away my hard-earned cash on this dribble drip-drop of a film. I guess you'd have to really love Tom Hanks to buy this DVD, and you'd also have to love films with weak plots and melodramatic overkill. <BR>The biggest failure of this film is that it labored to set up a 'hero's journey' plot where someone enters the unkown, faces and conquers the forces death (or evil), then returns A CHANGED MAN. The problem is that character played by Tom Hanks comes back to society even more lost than when he was a castaway! I could care less about some insecure adult and his return from what could have been enlighteneing experience (but for whom it was like hell), only to follow around the first lady who catches his eye like a lost puppy dog. Tom Hanks looks so directionless about who he is and what his journey meant that his desperation for a 'soul-mate' upon his return comes off as just overly needy and sad. <BR>I'm sure that many men of needy dispositon will love this film. As for me, I need my [money] back!
B00005RHGL|5.0|Let's get this straight for people who think otherwise.  Tombstone was made before Wyatt Earp was.  So saying that this is \\"retelling\\" the Wyatt Earp movie, or basing this movie off of anything that happened in that movie is pure nonsensical garbage.(By the way, I enjoy and own both of these movies and have seen them many times.)<br />All the characters in this movie were played magnificently.  My favorite character must've been Doc Holiday, of course.  Whom which Val Kilmer did an excellent job of portraying.  Some people seem to think that a bitter man can't be funny?  Well, he was both.  He played bitter well, then he came with his facetious comments, which just happened to be funny.<br />The story goes as this: Wyatt Earp has retired to Tombstone to spend the rest of his life with his lover and his brothers.  He wants to have a peaceful life.  As soon as him and the brothers settle in, after being re-acquaintanced with Doc Holiday (Kilmer), trouble starts to arise when a gang known as the \\"Cowboys\\" start causing trouble in Tombstone.  At first, Wyatt (Russell) wants to let the police handle it themselves, he wants no part in it.  But once his brothers become Sheriffs and he sees things aren't getting any better in Tombstone, he feels compelled to join.  More squirmishes come about between the Earp boys and the Cowboys and eventually Wyatt gets insanely rageful.  Rageful because of the Death of his brother, Morgan, at the hands of the Cowboys.  His vows to kill them all, and does.<br />I hope I did not trivialize the plot and the movie in general, because there is so much going on in it.  That's just a small outline of the main plot.  People think that it has some lame plot devices.  Do they even realize that this was based on a true story?  That makes it a little more interesting, you can't expect everything to be Hollywood fabricated ...  But unfortunately that's all some people expect and want, and when they don't get it, it upsets them.  For shame!<br />Side-Note: Plenty of time for Earp's change from pacifist to rage-driven man was allowed.  I mean, how much time does it take for you to get angry and murderous after people have killed your brother?<br />And another horrible thing is that people can't realize the difference between the stories of Wyatt Earp and Tombstone.  Tombstone is based on events that happened in Tombstone and they happened to involve Wyatt Earp.  Wyatt Earp the movie is based on the entire life of Wyatt Earp, not just Tombstone.  It seems like the people believing Wyatt Earp is just Tombstone, know Tombstone pizzas better than the actual movie.<br />The bottom line is: If you want an action-packed movie that tells a great, TRUE story with fine acting then buy this movie.
0767817478|1.0|This 1998 version is so lame I can't even begin to tell you; but let me try... <BR>This highly touted, highly flouted modern remake of an old classic has done a great disservice to its original prototype. In fact, this monster (and movie) should not even be called 'Godzilla', because it lacks all of the elements which made the origials so great... <BR>This 1998 version of 'Godzilla' is like some over-teched video game mixed with a terrible plot and lame acting. I'm sorry but Gozilla is more than big chunk of pixels and graphics that destroys New Yrok City. Godzilla, the original, Japanese Godzilla at least, is a creature whose very clumsiness makes it more realistic, and is a monster who attacks, not to be the next biggest blockbuster hit, but due to a tragic bout with radiation poisoning. <BR>Its such a shame when movies are remade into modern flops, and when great, almost mythical entitites such as Godzilla are molded into mere graphic toys for overly-confident, technocratic filmmakers and their money-making attemps. This film flopped. Get it? Godzilla is not merely a computer-generated toy, but a saga that is supposed to have a plot, a purpose, and at least a decent screenplay. You will not find any of those qualities with this flashy 1998 'attempted' remake. Get the original Japanese version instead, or you will really be missing out. You can throw this one in the toilet and stuff it down the drain with the plunger, never to be seen again.
B00000IGGA|5.0|For over 30 years, Tom Waits has brought his brooding tales of sadness &amp; woe to the masses. His extremely raspy voice &amp; laid-back jazz sound have not only brought him success as a musician, but also as an actor. Most of Francis Ford Coppola's films would not be complete without an appearance by Waits. Lately, Waits has concentrated on acting so much, that he's almost neglected where he came from. It had been nearly 7 years since his last album BONE MACHINE (1992). This album was darkness at its best &amp; Waits proves he hasn't let up this dark curtain yet with his 1999 album MULE VARIATIONS.<br />Waits' jazzy sound often betrays his real influence on popular music. Some of the guest stars on this album are not jazz musicians in the slightest, like Primus frontman Les Claypool for example. The diverse guest list on MULE VARIATIONS is just as well, seeing as how MULE VARIATIONS is one of Waits' most varied efforts.<br />Those who remember ZZ Top before the ELIMINATOR-era will see their influence on Waits' music with such songs as &quot;Big In Japan&quot;, &quot;Cold Water&quot; &amp; &quot;Filipino Box Spring Hog&quot;. Instead of the focus being on piano like Waits' earliest songs, it's placed on guitar, which helps the songs rock, instead of just swing.<br />This album may be Waits' chance to rock out, but his old songs of sadness &amp; heartbreak are still evident on somber ballads like &quot;House Where Nobody Lives&quot;, &quot;Picture In A Frame&quot; &amp; &quot;Georgia Lee&quot;. The music on these songs is so faint, you're practically jolted out of your seat as soon as Waits' gravel-voiced self arrives on the scene.<br />A few songs have Waits experimenting with a sort of tribal rhythm that would not have been out of place on Paul Simon's GRACELAND album. &quot;Lowside Of The Road&quot;, &quot;Eyeball Kid&quot; &amp; &quot;Chocolate Jesus&quot; all have drums so high in the mix, you're just waiting for some natives to come dancing out of your stereo.<br />No singles were released from this album I don't think, but the best candidate would have been the heartfelt ballad &quot;Hold On&quot;. At first listen, I thought this was an outtake from Bruce Springsteen's NEBRASKA album. Springsteen fans, however, might enjoy this rare chance to see Waits in an almost clear-voiced croon.<br />I've always been a critic of why some artists take an eternity to record a new album. Some people say it's a matter of getting the music on tape the way they like it, or that their inspiration occasionally runs dry for long periods of time. But unlike such famous perfectionists like Paul Simon, Stevie Wonder &amp; Tom Scholz (Boston), Tom Waits doesn't keep his fans waiting for something new while trying to make things sound absolutely perfect. Acting may be Waits' forte nowadays, but MULE VARIATIONS is proof that whenever Waits does get into the groove of making music again, he doesn't disappoint his fans &amp; is well worth the wait.<br />No singles were released from this album I don't think, but the best candidate would have been the heartfelt ballad &quot;Hold On&quot;.

Though the subject matter may be sacred the humor is light and fun instead of being offencive as most comedies dealing with cristianity tend to be.  I recomend this book to anyone looking for a fun read that will leave you feeling a little better about the universe than you did when you started.
B000002GYR|5.0|I'm both surprised & overjoyed to see how much of today's younger music fans are lovers of Tom Waits. My own sister, who's more into the independent scene than anything else, is a Waits fan, but more of his later, gruffer work. I'm sure even Tom himself had no idea of the direction his career would take at the time he recorded his 1973 debut album CLOSING TIME. His voice is actually at a smooth croon (that would soon go to pot, much to our benefit) & his songwriting was both worldly & of this world (for some of Waits' more abstract work, check out his 1980s albums for Island Records). Nevertheless, even at the beginning, Waits had something special, be it normal or strange.<br />The album opens with probably Tom's most famous song \\"Ol' 55\\", which would be covered by the Eagles on their 1974 album ON THE BORDER. At first, Waits didn't like their version, until he a got a big royalty check in the mail. Theirs is great, but it's Tom's bare-bones, just-voice-and-piano incarnation that reigns supreme, allowing the listener to take in the beautiful lyrics that are this song. In fact, ballads are the focus of this album, with \\"Midnight Lullaby\\", \\"Lonely\\" \\"Little Trip To Heaven [On The Wings Of Your Love]\\" & \\"Grapefruit Moon\\" standing out. All these songs will certainly have fans of Waits' more experimental stuff scratching their heads & wondering if they really are listening to a Tom Waits record. They certainly are, just a tiny bit different.<br />CLOSING TIME also hints at the barstool philosophies that Tom would adopt on much of the rest of his 1970s work. Character studies like \\"Old Shoes [& Picture Postcards]\\", \\"Ice Cream Man\\", \\"Martha\\", \\"Rosie\\" (Tom doing a country song? You bet!) & \\"I Hope That I Don't Fall In Love With You\\" (quite a sweet song despite its unflattering title) are proof of this & in smaller doses hint at the avant-garde leanings Tom's music would soon take.<br />What's Tom Waits' best album? Some would say BONE MACHINE (1992) & I wouldn't doubt that, but I think it's maybe the best from when Tom's music was on a whole other plane of existence. As for his earlier, more musical work, I'd say this or maybe BLUE VALENTINE (1978) would take the prize. Nevertheless, even this early in Tom Waits' career, the seeds were being sown for something great. Even if Tom hadn't gotten in touch with his inner Captain Beefheart, he could still have had a fruitful career as a sweet, yet still very distinctive balladeer. CLOSING TIME was the beginning of that & what would become one of the most radical & outrageous artistic evolutions in music history.but I think it's maybe the best from when Tom's music was on a whole other plane of existence.

B000002GWJ|5.0|Tom Waits has had a career in music that is mercurial at best. His 1973 debut CLOSING TIME was probably the closest he got to recording a tried-and-true singer-songwriter album, but the follow-up, 1974's HEART OF SATURDAY NIGHT, proved that, lyrically at least, Tom was beginning to make changes that would drastically alter his sound & image. It was a slow process, but by 1978's BLUE VALENTINE, the fruits of that change were starting to show. Tom's voice was just beginning to get more edgy & his lyrics were starting to go off into other dimensions altogether. Yet there was still melody high up in the mix, making BLUE VALENTINE a good way to ease into the more experimental stuff.<br /><br />I was shocked as well as anyone when I heard the album open with \\"Somewhere\\" from WEST SIDE STORY. But it's the voice that sings it, an early example of gravel-voiced Waits that at first jars the listener, then suddenly sounds natural. Definitely the most original interpretation of this song!<br /><br />Furthermore, the imagery in Tom's lyrics was getting more & more unique. Titles like \\"Red Shoes By The Drugstore\\", \\"Christmas Card From A Hooker In Minneapolis\\", \\"Whistlin' Past The Graveyard\\" & \\"A Little Bullet From A Pretty Blue Gun\\" with words to match are proof that Tom was on the road to a different musical journey that would both leave longtime listeners behind & welcome even more newer ones. In fact, this is the album that turned me into a Tom Waits fan.<br /><br />For those still floored by Tom's sudden musical change of heart, there were songs like \\"Romeo Is Bleeding\\", \\"Kentucky Avenue\\" & \\"Blue Valentines\\", which were still musically close to Waits' earlier work, but the lyrics were showing signs of evolution. They should probably listen with caution to \\"$29.00\\", for the unorthodox rhythm to that song hints at the amusical approach Waits was working towards at the time.<br /><br />BLUE VALENTINE is often given a glossing-over in Tom Waits' legacy, calling it a transitional work at best. Sure it may have been, but even that from Tom Waits is guaranteed to be better than most other artists'. You could tell that Tom was starting to evolve, but he still had one foot left in the past, not quite ready to abandon his previous sound just yet. Those lovers of early Tom Waits who've found his later work to be a trying experience, BLUE VALENTINE will be a good introduction of Tom Waits moving from normal to out-there.work at best.

B000001EKX|4.0|If you listen to the Alive albums by KISS, you know that most of their music is played faster on them, and the studio versions are often somewhat slower in play. Well, with Hotter Than Hell, SOME, and I repeat SOME of the songs are slower in beat than what you would hear live. This is especially the case with Got To Choose and Hotter Than Hell. But is this to say the music isn't as good as the live versions? No way! This is good ol Rock and Roll Metal through and through. Plus, with this CD you get to hear Goin Blind, Strange Ways, All The Way, Mainline, and Comin Home, songs not released on Alive, AliveII, or AliveIII. Two of my favorites of this CD are Mainline (which I believe is sang by Peter Criss) and Strange Ways, which is really deep heavy metal and I believe is also sang by Peter.
0790738074|5.0|Meredith Willson's &quot;The Music Man&quot; was a phenomenal success on Broadway (1957) before it came to Hollywood.  At this point in time, in Hollywood musical history, studios wanted to be certain that they had a &quot;sure thing&quot; before they expended any amount of money on the musical.  Consequently, most of the musicals being made in Hollywood had previously been successful on Broadway.  The same principle applied to &quot;The Music Man.&quot;<br />Director Morton DaCosta and choreographer Onna White also handled the Broadway production and several of the original Broadway cast members were featured in the movie including Pert Kelton, The Buffalo Bills singing quartet and last but not least Robert Preston.  Even though Preston portrayed the dynamic Professor Hill on Broadway, he was awarded the starring role in the movie only after Cary Grant turned down the studio.  Preston's enthusiastic character in the movie, his style, his charm and his personality reflected in Professor Hill are the qualities that went on to make the movie as successful as the Broadway play.  According to Ted Sennett in his book 'Hollywood Musicals,' &quot;His performance is a miracle of energy and drive, perfectly in key to the style and intention of the film.&quot;<br />&quot;The Music Man&quot; centers on down home America, Iowa style, circa 1912.  The crux of the plot involves a fast-talking, good looking, and smooth kind of guy called Professor Harold Hill.  In actuality, he's a con man who goes from small town to small town, making a fast buck.  However, when he arrives in River City, he doesn't realize that he has met his Waterloo.  He proceeds in trying to convince these small town folks that there's 'trouble right here in River City,' referring to the young people who are hanging around with nothing to do.  He puts himself across as a music teacher and tries to get all of the parents to buy band instruments and uniforms in order to form a band that he can instruct.  Wanting to do the best for their children, parents go along with his suggestion, not realizing that he knows nothing about music, bands or band instruments.  Marian (Shirley Jones), the town's librarian sees through his façade but also at the same time, falls in love with him.  The movie ends with the famous song '76 trombones.'<br />The songs in this movie flowed smoothly with the storyline and there was something for everyone.  The production number &quot;The Wells Fargo Wagon&quot; involved members of the whole town, looking and waiting for the Wells Fargo Wagon to deliver all the things that were ordered from the catalogue.  Children and adults alike were all excited about the arrival, which was a big happening in this little town. Robert Preston's rendition of 'Trouble' set the tone for the movie and showed, in music, how he could incite the townspeople and get just what he wanted.  Shirley Jones and Robert Preston vocalizing on 'Till There Was You' made it very clear that they cared deeply for one another and the audience knew, at that point, that he wasn't going to leave River City.  The grand finale, with the marching band playing '76 Trombones' was really the high point of the movie and &quot;...the musical's biggest hit song...which Preston makes virtually his own with every confident stride and strut&quot; (Ted Sennett, &quot;Hollywood Musicals&quot;).  It's a song in the movie where you just had to join in with the music.<br />&quot;The Music Man&quot; is two and a half hours of sheer pleasure. Yes, it was corny, but so were a lot of other musicals.  Maybe that's what made it so appealing.  If it didn't have the staying power it wouldn't be around today, being shown repeatedly on television and being sold on videocassette and DVD.  Robert Preston and Shirley Jones will always be fondly remembered for their excellent portrayals in this movie.to do the best for their children, parents go along with his suggestion, not realizing that he knows nothing about music, bands or band instruments.

0060977493|5.0|this is by far one of THE greatest books that i have ever read. roy makes her story come alive with language so pure and poetic that it will make your heart sing. addressing such human rights issues such as the treatment of untouchables in india's caste system, she does so with amazing grace and the truth only an eyewitness could produce. sexual abuse, notions of femininity and motherhood, loneliness and despair, they are all interwoven into this tapestry of words. a rich, fulfilling book that will leave you stunned, and looking for more. give her the booker prize, yes! she deserves it.
B00005BJC7|5.0|Amnesiac, yes like Kid A, but thats only because these songs were going to be on Kid A, so that means this album is basically B-Sides, but i swear to god, i love this album. I like all the radiohead albums i have [the bends, ok computer, i might be wrong live recordings, and i have heard a lot from kid a i need to get it, i only know 2 songs from pablo honey) and i must say this is one of my favorites. every song on this is great. its one of those albums you listen to over and over again. i do.<br />packd like sardines in a crusht tin box- a catchy one, electronic drums, but a good start to this album.<br />pyramid song- what can i say? i love this song, it's the albums 'fake plastic trees' or 'paranoid android' it starts off nice and quiet and it builds up near the end, its also a hit single.<br />pulk/pull revolving doors- this song isn't bad, i like it, its not my favorite, its got a nice pounding beat to it with loops and thom's voice is electronically enhanced, very creative, and very odd.<br />you and whose army?- one of my favorite songs on the album, i wish this song was longer than 3:09. it is sort of like 'the pyramid song' starting off quiet then it builds up at the end with a beautiful spine tingling piano at the end.<br />i might be wrong- great song, thom's voice blends right in with this song the way he howls and all, and the way it stops and turns into a softer song toward the end is creative.<br />knives out- kind of a classy rock song. it reminds me of a surf song from the late 60s early 70s, phil's drumming is excellent and jonny's guitar playing is also to. thom's slow singing is great in this song.<br />morning bell/amnesiac- this song is sort of spooky, it isn't as close as the kid a morning bell version but i can recongize it. the lyrics are the same except at the end thom doesn't say those haunting hard to hear lyrics. it kind of sounds like a vampire theme song. the only thing i don't like about it is the positive sounding ending, it throwsoff the concept of the song. its good though.<br />dollars and cents- by god, yet another brilliant track. thom is wanting us to recongize the greedy people in this world, he couldn't explain it more with the threatening lyric \\"we're gonna crack your little souls\\" this song relys heavily on the bass, but i love this song, you probably would to most likely.<br />hunting bears- what a treat! a short barely 2 min long instrumental track. i love the guitar in this, its a very mysterious song.<br />like spinning plates- how many times will i say this? ANOTHER brilliant track. this song amazes you with its technology of reversing and loops, there is also a piano version of this song on 'i might be wrong-live recordings' <br />life in a glass house- once again, ANOTHER BRILLIANT TRACK. radiohead explore's its musical taste by creating a sort of early new orleans jazz genre for this song. no guitars or anything, just trumpets, trombone's piano's, jazzy like drums and thom's singing. i love this track. a great ending song for a great album.
B00005OAIE|5.0|This cd is definitely one of the best of 2002. You never have to press skip because every song is so wonderful. If you are looking for a good cd to listen to while driving or just hanging out at home buy this cd.
0451197879|5.0|So far &quot;Roadwork&quot; is my favorite King book. It descriibes the story of Bart Dawes, a man working for a laundrymat whose house and job are in the way of a new highway. Unlike the normal civilian however, Bart has BIG issues with this and does everything he can to stop it. It shows how King can really write a nonhoror story that still grips you til you turn the last page. A great stroy...no...A MUST READ!
0385335482|5.0|I would say the story was 90% well-written. It becomes a real page-turner during the last 100 pages or so. However, just as it becomes a real page-turner, Kinsella also neglects to maintain a good flow in storytelling. Many of the heroine Rebecca Bloomwood's issues and headache sources suddenly disappear or are never addressed. I do, however, look forward to the sequel. Overall, it was a good entertaining light read.

B00005YXZH|5.0|My first listen to YFH was mixed, however this CD just gets better every time! Even after 20 listens it's still the only CD I want to listen to right now. Those brilliant moments from \\"She's A Jar\\" and \\"Via Chicago\\" off of Summerteeth are everywhere on this CD. Moments of absolute perfection include:<br />Track 5: Jesus, etc. At 2:00 enter pedal steel as Jeff Tweedy's voice cracks as he sings \\"voices whine, skyscrapers are scraping together\\" is just heaven.  Track 1: I am trying to break your heart. At  4:02 Piano and drums enter before \\"disposable Dixie cup drinker\\" lyric and as song goes into its Strawberry fields like ending.  Track 10: Poor Places. At 3:01 with its haunting descending piano line and acoustic guitar over drum marching is as good as music gets.  These examples are just a few that come to mind, there are many more on this CD. <br />Yes Jeff, \\"every moment is a little bit later\\" but you have created a CD where every moment is a wonderful work of art.  Thank you.
B00005JKED|5.0|I THINK EVERYBODY WAS SHOCKED YET IMPRESSED WITH THE ROLE DENZEL PLAYED IN THIS MOVIE. HE MADE THE CHRACTER SEEM SO REAL. EVERYONE IS SO USED TO DENZEL'S GOOD GUY ROLES BUT TRAINING DAY SHOWS THE BAD GUY ROLE THAT DENZEL IS ABLE TO PLAY. I CAN HONESTLY SAY THAT DENZEL IS AN INCREDIBLE ACTOR AND HAS BEEN SINCE HE'S BEEN IN THE BUSINESS. DON'T TAKE MY WORD FOR IT, JUST SEE THE BEST MOVIE I'VE EVER SEEN TRAINING DAY.
B00005YXZH|1.0|This is a five star album that I gave one star (see below).  Tweedy and Co. have evolved with each album since A.M.  Wilco began life as the Tweedier side of the ultimately schizophrenic Uncle Tupelo and A.M. reflected this trend.  However their albums grew more and more to be pieces within themselves; records that one listens to from start to finish.  Yankee Hotel represents the culmination of this trend.  Not only does it hang together all of a piece, the instrumentation and the sound of this record are a far cry from the garage-rock-cum-country of late Uncle Tupelo/early Wilco.  <br />CAVEAT EMPTOR: If this were a CD that I could listen to on my computer (where I listen to most music), I would give it five stars.  Buyer beware, however: it will not play on Windows or Linux with Winamp, Windows CD Player or Xmms.  It seems to work on dedicated cd players, however.  It's ironic that this band, which was technologically savvy enough to to stream Yankee Hotel Foxtrot from their Web site while looking for a label , ultimately released a CD apparently so flawed that it cannot be played on a PC!
B000003TA4|4.0|I connect to the 90's alt rock grunge music in ways that I can't with most other genre's. I think there were really alot of good things to be found in the music and lyrics of the era, and it saddens me that it has ended.<br />Ask almost anyone that lived in the 90's and paid attention to the music scene and they will tell you that Nirvana was the front band for the revolution, with their hit single and rock anthem &quot;smells like teen spirit&quot;. But ask almost any true fan of the music of the time who their favorite band of the 90's was and it likely they will tell you some band besides nirvana. It may be pearl jam or alice in chains or smashing pumpkins or any of the other big bands of the grunge genre, but many times it is not nirvana. Although I like nirvana and they put out much good music, they have been greatly over-rated and given credit that may not have been due<br />As far as the album in particular, it has some really great songs, don't get me wrong. Many radio singles and good songs that didn't make the radio can be found on the cd, but truth be told I don't listen to this album much at all compared to many other grunge cd's in my collection. If you are a big nirvana fan this is a no brainer, but if you wanted a good grunge album I would sooner recommend perhaps ten by pearl jam or siamese dream by Smashing pumpkins. <br />In summery, good album, but not nearly as incredable as one might be lead to believe.

I like fun made up faces but I also want to be able to wear it to work.  And this book is perfect.  From fun tips for work to tips for a night on the town, this book is very worth every penny for those who like to play with make-up. =)
B000002UJQ|5.0|This is a must own cd. You may not think so the first time you listen to it, but honestly give it a few runs through.<br />I wouldn't consider myself a huge radiohead fan. I love creep as many people do, and a few songs here and there really connect with me, but overall I don't follow them overly closely. This album is the exception. It is more musically strong than their first two albums, and not quite as out there as their newer stuff.<br />A key thing when listening to this album, is to realize that it is in fact an album. If you throw it on in your car and hit shuffle you will hear a bunch of pretty good songs, but nothing more. If, on the other hand, you listen to the album the whole way through, once the last song \\"the tourist\\" finishes you may very well be tempted to push play again and retake the ride you were just taken on. <br />The album contains intelectually interesting as well as emotional lyrics, as well as dense, intricate, and masterfully blended musical sounds. Thom's thick melodic voice is perfect for the music, and the instruments and synthasized sounds are perfect for the overall scope of the songs.<br />If your opinion of radiohead is that they are too weird and out there based on their newer stuff, give this album a shot as it combines more traditional rock soungs with the unique style of the band. If your opinion of radiohead is based soley on hearing their single \\"creep\\", open your mind and your cd player and be prepared to be changed.<br />If you aren't sure about radiohead, borrow the cd from someone but be prepared to buy it, for your friend will be sure to want the cd back, and you will find it hard to part with.
B000002NG7|4.0|4 and 1/2 stars....<br />I knew these guys could do it!  When I first heard 'Epic' from their 1989 album &quot;The Real Thing&quot;, I knew this band was going to be big.  But their following release &quot;Angel Dust&quot; proved a bit lacking for me.  I liked some of it, but felt that the band was far from realizing their potential.<br />With &quot;Album of the Year&quot; FNM have released a solid hard rock disc loaded with great hooks, melancholy minors, and thick bombast.  &quot;Head-On Collision&quot;, &quot;Last Cup of Sorrow&quot;, &quot;Stripsearch&quot;, &quot;Ashes to Ashes&quot; (the standout on the album), and &quot;Pristina&quot; (a beauty!) are top notch.  They make up for one or two other tracks that are good but not great.  <br />By the time this disc was released, many people (including myself) had written off FNM as early 90's has-beens.  That is unfortunate because this disc is far superior to the garbage being released by so many other bands these days....
B000002UAU|5.0|The beatles are obviously a huge influence on a great many styles of music. It seems to me that everyone that has an interest in music of the time period starting in the late 60's and running through today should own at least one or two beatle's albums.<br />Considering this, Sgt. Pepper's is not a bad place to start. It contains a good mix and variety of their style and sound as a band. Although it doesn't have as many of the popular singles that they are famous for, it is a highly good album in entirety, one which has both a good flow and replay value. Since buying the album my tastes have started leaning more towards the 90's alt rock scene, but I still pop this album in from time to time and am happily pleased to remember how incredable it is. <br />It is both diverse in sound yet true to the beatle's style, from classic epic songs such as &quot;a day in the life&quot; to more eastern sounding songs such as &quot;within you, without you&quot; to fun poppy ditties such as &quot;when I'm sixty four&quot;. <br />I love this album, and recommend it to any beatle's fan, anyone looking to buy a good beatle's album, or anyone with an open mind towards music in general.
B00004TL21|5.0|The deftones previous disc &quot;Around the Fur&quot; did nothing to prepare me for the sonic/sensory onslaught of &quot;White Pony&quot;, one of the best rock albums of recent memory.  With amazingly astute fingers, Terry Date and the 'tones have crafted their best release, one that will be remembered for a long time to come as a watershed moment for the band.<br />The 'tones fierceness and high octane output is present here, but it's not as 'in-your-face' as on previous releases.  The band actually shows (dare we say!) restraint here.  And the effect multiplies the power of those moments where the quintet really lets loose.  The songs here are sonically rich, not simply heavy in a &quot;My Own Summer&quot; kind of way, but textured.  The vocals are superb.  While some songs may be more interesting than others, everything is quite good.  The band won a Grammy award for hard rock performance for 'Elite' (personally I feel that 'Digital Bath' is the most fascinating track on the album.)<br />Highly recommended.
B000053V7Q|5.0|ELVIS: THAT'S THE WAY IT IS is a great documentary about Elvis' classic stage show in Vegas. Actually, there are several parts to it. The first half is devoted to the practice sessions. In July of 1970 we see Elvis at the MGM studios in Culver City with his band (James Burton- Lead guitar; John Wilkerson- rhythm guitar; Ronnie Tutt- drums; Glenn Hardin- Piano; Charlie Hodge- acoustic guitar/vocals, water &amp; scarves) going through various numbers. Elvis had just completed a marathon recording session in Nashville, and we hear Elvis &amp; band honing these tunes for the stage show. Elvis is apparently having a lot of fun, joking around with his friends and musicians. He had an amazing personality &amp; presence that really comes through here. By August 1970, Elvis moved into his residency: the International Hotel (now known as the Hilton). After a few weeks of further rehearsals (he is now joined by backup singers The Sweet Inspirations, Imperials, Millie Kirkham), the Elvis Summer Festival starts. The second half of the film is the stage show, recorded August 10,11 &amp; 12 1970. Elvis sings these songs: THAT'S ALL RIGHT, I'VE LOST YOU, PATCH IT UP, LOVE ME TENDER, SWEET CAROLINE, I JUST CAN'T HELP BELIEVIN, TIGER MAN, POLK SALAD ANNIE, ONE NIGHT, HEARTBREAK HOTEL, YOU'VE LOST THAT LOVIN FEELIN, BRIDGE OVER TROUBLED WATER, SUSPICIOUS MINDS, CAN'T HELP FALLING IN LOVE. It is obvious that Elvis was still passionate about the music. He was in good shape, and still young in appearance. I love those classic white jumpsuits. A few more notes: The opening credits sequence of the original movie was filmed at the Phoenix Coliseum on September 9, 1970. I hope that more footage of this can be found, there does seem to be a bit more excitement going on there than the formal confines of the International Hotel. Check out ELVIS: THE LOST PERFORMANCES for additional footage from this movie, and ELVIS ON TOUR (1972). <br />The updated 30th anniversary edition contains a lot of alternate footage, which is welcomed, but the new presentation does NOT replace the original 1970 That's The Way It is, which remains the ultimate Seventies Elvis documentary.
630196697X|5.0|We know Widmark will be tough before the film even starts but the surprise is watching Peters who is tough, smart and terrific. The first scene has no dialog as we just take in Peters and Widmark up against each other on a packed train car. And it gets better with the first kiss in the shack. As an earlier reviewer wrote, the writing is superior- I loved everything except the last line where Candy and Skip leave the police station. Thelma Ritter is a bonus.

6301966015|3.0|I think this is a more pretentious than Antonioni's other films-full of Austin Powers sets and human props. In films like La Notte the pace is sullen and slow but there was a humanity to the stories. There's a central event driving this story, but who cares about the murdered guy? Why should we? But the absolute  worst part of the film is the ending, summing up the film with  an invisible tennis ball.
B00004BZ0N|5.0|Rolling Stone magazine picked London Calling as the greatest album of the 1980s even tho it was released in 1979.  Oh well, it was released on December 14.  In substance, it is an album of the '80s, just barely.  I and many agree with Rolling Stone.  As a vinyl double LP it was the best album of the 1980s, and if you consider it part of the 1970s, it is one of the top five.<br />London Calling is a devastating and electrifying recording showing The Clash at the height of their musical power.  The Clash's roots are as a punk group, but to the extent this is punk, it is the most melodic punk I have ever heard.  But the reality is that the group had evolved into eclectic hard rockers from the harsh, punkified sound of their earlier years.  The songs are very polished.  Aside from the great songs, London Calling represents an astounding display of versatility.  What is amazing is that the songs are of such high caliber in spite of the fact that the group combines so many different facets of music yet still does so clearly within the parameters of its own style.  There are ska and reggae, jazz, rock, rockabilly, and blues, but every song sounds distinctly like The Clash, having some prominent mark of the group.  To do this without wasting a cut is quite an accomplishment.  The key is the group's supreme talents with driving rhythms, on either harder-rock or more-moderately-textured songs.  <br />The Clash's anarchical lyrics are an important part of their schtick.  They have a message--but does everyone care?  I am not a revolutionary.  The Clash sing about political and social themes.  I am not saying they have no importance, but are they really that compelling to everyone, and even objectively?  The U.K. was not falling apart at the time.  I examine the lyrics vicariously, as art, and enjoy them--they are great.  But my chief focus is the great sound, as well as the humor of both the lyrics and the music.  Indeed, this album is funny, aside from the social commentary.Protest songs with a punk base can perhaps be said to inherently have a sense of humor, but how many groups can musically represent humor so well, and with such power?   Well, The Doors in \\"Twentieth Century Fox,\\" for example.  The Who in \\"Dr. Jimmy\\" are very cool, but the music, while blending with the lyrics, is more just good hard-driving rock.  The Stones are funny with country sometimes, but not with The Clash's intensity.  I am saying all this because I realize my favorite songs are the funny ones. \\"Spanish Bombs,\\" with its at once romantic and satirical driving rhythms, is my favorite song on the album in spite of its repetitiveness.  Let's return to the idealism of the Spanish Civil War, man, and do it up!  \\"Wrong 'Em Boyo,\\" with its ska beat, is actually the funniest song--it is a riot.  \\"Jimmy Jazz,\\" \\"The Right Profile,\\" and \\"Koka Kola\\" (that one-liner, Koka Kola and kocaine!), there are so many.  As to \\"Rudie Can't Fail\\" (ska and Reggae)--today I say, \\"take that, Osama\\" (ha ha).<br />The title cut is not one of the strongest, but the album really takes off with the next one, the extremely-hard-driving rockabilly \\"Brand New Cadillac.\\"  The group also displays its power prominently in \\"Hateful,\\" \\"Clampdown,\\" \\"Koka Kola,\\" and other songs.  After \\"Koka Kola,\\" there is somewhat of a letup in power, but the songs are still interesting.  \\"Revolution Rock\\" is more reggae, and \\"Lover's Rock\\" is sentimental.  In the entire 19-song set, nothing is wasted; there are merely some tracks that are not as strong as others.  Some of the less-intense cuts are among the strongest, too, like the pensive \\"Lost in the Supermarket.\\"<br />London Calling is one of my favorite ten albums of all time.  Those great beats and driving rhythms, at once powerful and melodic, there is nothing like it. The arrangement of the music within the songs is also excellent.  If you want the lush instrumental arrangements of Love on \\"Forever Changes,\\" fine, but I want to listen to London Calling.For pure hard-driving rock and roll guitar power, it is unbeatable.

This should have been titled David Gilmour part III or the follow up to that 2nd DG album \\"about ...\\" ooops sorry \\"about face\\".

B0000636UN|3.0|This record has a lot of so-so songs and a lot of borrowed talent that seems wasted. However, the so-so songs on a Sheryl Crow record still run circles around any other contemporary pop-rock junk that's either too saccharine or embarrassingly explicit. The opening track, \\"Steve McQueen,\\" is fun without being frothy, and has a great Southern rock feel. The first single, \\"Soak Up the Sun,\\" is another great sing-a-long car song, and the title track is unexpectedly catchy and well-written despite the lame title. <br />Most of the rest of the album could be ignored. It's not bad--with the exception of the very embarrassing \\"It's So Easy\\" featuring Don Henley, which considerably weakens the record--but definitely not what I was expecting from Crow after \\"The Globe Sessions.\\" \\"You're an Original\\" sounds like it was written for Lenny Kravitz, who sounds great, but it's his sound and not hers we're hearing. \\"Diamond Road\\" is pretty forgettable as well. And Crow's \\"It's Only Love\\" is not nearly as wonderful and sad as the same track Stevie Nicks recorded on last year's \\"Trouble in Shangri-La.\\" <br />Also of concern are all the guest spots. Natalie Maines, Liz Phair, and Gwyneth Paltrow all appear but you can't tell their voices from any other studio musicians', they're so buried beneath production. I had to read the liner notes to even notice they were on the tracks. And Stevie Nicks, rock goddess and legend, is wasted on this album. Too bad, because Sheryl Crow did a fabulous job producting tracks on Nicks' \\"Shangri-La.\\"<br />This album, even with so many mediocre tracks, is still worth your time because Crow's voice is in top form and her musicianship is excellent.
6303168507|5.0|Masterfully Directed, Vividly Depicted, and brimming with emotion and history, Stephen Spielberg's Schindler's List is a pure work of genius and a sobering look at a horrible time and realm of human history - early twentieth century Europe and the Holocaust.  From frame one to its powerfully climactic conclusion, the film running 184 minutes long evokes for over three hours the viewers very humanity while tracing the life of one man - Oskar Schindler (Liam Nisen) in his experience and development throughout the war.  It is a work of absolute grandeur and historic retelling, important both in its subject and delineation of a horrible time in human history.  The film is hauntingly presented with a recurring theme of John William music that serves to draw the whole together and cast an eerie loom of darkness throughout the film.  It is disturbingly open in its depiction of people place and events, a movie worth much more than most of its kind, inspired, and truthful.<BR> The film traces one man, historically based Oskar Schindler in his development throughout the war - World War II - and Holocaust.  He is an unique individual, oven shown in the light of a hero, yet humanized by his own flaws among which alcoholism, womanizing and personal greed dominate.  Not the immediate figure the viewer will identify as a hero, nor the modest gentle soul that he is often associated with, Oskar Schindler is a man in the war to make money and become rich, Jews, Nazis, conflict all foreign and unimportant aspects to an ultimate goal of success.  A tall and built man that rises above the rest in his audacity and determination, not to mention collective and sociable character, Schindler is throughout the film a continual conflict to himself and his aspirations for success.  A likable character that undergoes profound change throughout the film, Schindler becomes the hero the title of the movie suggests having given up his wealth and livelihood to save a few insignificant Jewish live ands having in the end played the Nazis for his own benefit.<BR> Yet, the film is most important in the way it depicts Oscar Schindler overall, as a well adapted man to war, and resourceful entrepreneur.  He is popular and well liked, with high ranking powerful friends, and the wealth to enjoy all the benefits of social mobility and bribery in a time the world has seemed to have fallen apart.  He is an impeccable character in impeccable dress, openly a member of the Nazi party, yet increasingly opposed - if on a personal level - to Nazi atrocities.  Nonetheless aimed at success, he is a able to culminate mild relationships with authorities to gain favors, all the while determined to exploit the war and the Jews for cheap labor.  <BR> However, Schindler's ingenuity truly lies in his prowess at forming relationships and skill at scheming.  Able to effectively exploit the Nazis in an increasing way throughout the film, he forms his industry under the work and experience of Jewish Itzhak Stern who played by Ben Kingsley formulates Schindler's business as a way to save his fellow Jews from a certain death.  Stern recruits and aims at Jews most likely to be the target of Nazi anti-Semitism and cruelty, while providing for Schindler \\"skilled\\" labor, in order to generate his aspired wealth.  However, above all Stern's relationship to Schindler as a Jew targeted by the party Schindler is openly a member is something of great importance to the film.  Not only does he serve to change Schindler from a entrepreneur bent on success to a humanitarian solely caring for his Jews, but he seems to embody the whole of Jewish suffering from an indirect point of accountant.  <BR> Based on the Holocaust however, the film does in an important way depict this horrible historical event.  Whether it be through Spielberg's on-site filming at - Auschwitz and Schindler's factory among the notable others -  or the horrible depiction of human suffering and cruelty focused in haunting black and white,the film adequately shows for perhaps the first time in Hollywood cinematography the true atrocities of the Holocaust and its effects on people.  Focusing even more directly on a Nazi labor camp commandant Amon Goeth and his representation of absolute evil and depravity the film shows a man take Jews as target practice, kill twenty-five men for the actions of one, and devastatingly destroy the whole world of a people and one girl - Helen Hirsch - whom he falls in love with ironically, sparing only on his impulse of false affection.  Regardless, in the end he is depicted as the ultimate atrocity, the manifestation of Nazi evil, and a symbol of the more widespread and horrible atrocities that made up the Holocaust.  <BR>Above all a genius work of cinematography, acting and screenplay (Steven Zaillian) Schindler's List is not a celebration of people or history, but a solemn tale of darkness and depravity, outlining one of humanity's most dark and disturbing periods.  It is a wonderfully crafted and depicted work, based on the novel of Thomas Keneally, it is hauntingly open in its depiction of Holocaust conditions and personal experiences.  Its final powerful conclusion of a generation united with the survivors of the human atrocity is an exceptional and powerful conclusion to an phenomenal film, that ends in honor of Oskar Schindler and to all those who perished in the Holocaust.  In the end however, the film leaves you in amazement and awe, the slow tune of William stirring in the depths of your mind evoking memories of a film that seems too realistic and harsh to be even remotely true.  It leaves the forcible impression of suffering and heroism, and a important reminder of human good. \\"Whoever saves one life, saves the world entire,\\" the tagline of a momentous movie and catastrophic story, of a devastated people and changed man - Oscar Schindler.
B00000273M|5.0|Being 15-years-old, most people like my friends find it strange how I love listening to what they would call 'old' music. I especially Chicago, Donna Summer, Debbie Gibson, Sheena Easton, Paul McCartney, and many others. They had talent and a style of music which I can't help loving! &quot;The Bangles&quot; are certainly a great example of the reason I LOVE the 80's pop music!<br />The band came together in 1981 in Los Angeles though they really started to become popular in the mid and later 80's. &quot;The Bangles&quot; was first started by sisters Debbi and Vicki Peterson (vocals, drums, bass) when they answered a want ad given out by Susanna Hoffs (vocals, guitar). Later on were joined by Annette Zilinskas on the bass. Their first real hit album was in 1985, &quot;Different Light&quot;, their second album with Columbia. In that album they had the hit songs &quot;Manic Monday&quot; (aided by Prince) and &quot;Walk Like an Egyptian&quot;. Then came their next album, &quot;Everything&quot;, which produced their number one hit song, &quot;Eternal Flame&quot;. Sadly from then on, the group broke up.<br />Here is my song by song review for &quot;The Bangles: Greatest Hits&quot; album:<BR>1) *Hero Takes a Fall* - The Bangles show that they don't care if 'the hero takes a fall'. Very upbeat rock song, Susanna Hoff's voice is perfect for this song! ~And I won't feel bad at all, when the hero takes fall. When the hero takes, hero takes a fall.~<BR>2) *Going Down to Liverpool* - Not one of my favorite songs on the album, it's a medium fast song with lead vocals by Debbie Peterson.<BR>3) *Manic Monday* - Great song! I always smile when listening to this song, with lyrics like, ~But I can't be late cause then I just won't get paid, These are the days when you wish your bed was already made.~ The intro is really pretty with the synthesizer and peppy drum beat. This is actually the song which at first wanted me to get a Bangles album.<BR>4) *If She Knew What She Wants* - A nicesong with very sweet harmonies, you can't help but listen to the whole song singing along. Nice guitar work.<BR>5) *Walk Like an Egyptian* - One of the BEST songs by the Bangles! Very, VERY cool song, you can't help but get hooked to it! From the first intro with the tambourine, like I said, you're hooked. The guitar work is well-done and I love the break in the song where you can hear the tune whistled. Next thing you know, you're 'walking like an Egyptian'!<BR>6) *Walking Down Your Street* - A catchy song with cool drum and bass beat, and the chorus is really fun to sing with! <BR>7) *Following* - Personally I don't really care for this song, a bit too slow for me. I must admit the guitar work is beautiful but again, it's not my favorite song.<BR>8) *Hazy Shade of Winter* - Newer version of Paul Simon's song, this song is one of my favorites! It's a very COOL song, the song which most portrays the Bangles beautiful harmonizing. Yes, the harmonizing is very well done and used in a great song such as this, it's sure to be a hit for you, too!<BR>9) *In Your Room* - An upbeat song, the drums, synthesizer, and bass are the instruments mostly heard which is the perfect backup up for Susanna Hoffs' voice.<BR>10) *Eternal Flame* - The best ballad I've ever heard, the lyrics, music, and harmonizing all make &quot;Eternal Flame&quot; into a beautiful song. Though one of the few slow songs on the album, I strongly suggest you listen through the whole song, the last minute or so has beautiful harmonizing.<BR>11) *Be With You* - Debbie Peterson sings the lead vocals and I must say she does an amazing job. There's one part in the song where it quiets down for a little bit where the music is just beautiful!<BR>12) *I'll Set You Free* - Another of my favorite songs, I really like the harmony in the chorus. I also like the lyrics in this love song. ~I remember eyes that shine, that look so hard back into mine, now it's just a memory so I'll set you free.~<BR>13) *Everything I Wanted* - A song which certainly rocks, it has 'everything I would have wanted' in it. <BR>14) *Where Were You When I Needed You* - A mediocre version from the Grassroots song, it's more like a country style of song. Somehow didn't make much of an impression on me.<br />So put all together, &quot;The Bangles Greatest Hits&quot; is a terrific album which I will be listening for a long, long time. And for those who like Susanna Hoffs' voice, I recommend the album &quot;Timespace&quot; by Stevie Nicks, whose voice if very similar to Hoffs' voice. Stevie Nicks also relies on strong drum beat to backup her voice. A little trivia, you can also listen to Stevie Nicks in most any of Fleetwood Mac's albums, another 80's group. (my favorite album is &quot;Behind the Mask&quot;)
0671042858|5.0|This was a great book! My first of Stephen King (I know, I know). I have a feeling it is very different from his other books, just judging from their movie versions, which are probably pretty chopped up.  I really enjoyed this book, it was breath-taking to see what was going to happen next.  A page-turner!
B000001C6M|5.0|Slayer is one of the greatest bands metal has ever seen. Their debut is filled with the aggression and thrash that Slayer is well known for. Kerry and Jeff's solo's are fast, furious, and well executed; some of the best Slayer solos i have ever heard are on this album. This is, in my opinion, one of the darkest thrash albums ever made. About as heavy as heavy metal was back in 1983.
0345440803|5.0|I bought this book because it's title reminded me of \\"The Child Whisperer\\" by Matt Pasquinilli. One of the best books on parenting I have ever read, \\"The Child Whisperer\\" taught me how to effectively communicate with my overactive son and highly distractible daughter. <br />\\"The Horse Whisperer\\" as a movie was ok, but the real man behind the story, Monty Roberts, is a common sense genius. The fact is, Monty Roberts not only whispered to horses, but he raised over forty foster kids.(Rent \\"Story of a Real Horse Whisperer\\" by the BBC at your local video store - or buy Monty Roberts book here at amazon.com.)<br />\\"Secrets of The Baby Whisperer for Toddlers\\" is not exactly the same concept, but it is very helpful for younger children. If you are a \\"Whisperer\\" fan like me, then you will want this on your shelf next to \\"The Child Whisperer\\" and \\"The Horse Whisperer.\\"

B00001ODHF|5.0|ARMY OF DARKNESS is the third film in the EVIL DEAD series. The first movie in the series, EVIL DEAD, was a strictly horror film containing a humorous moment every now and again. EVIL DEAD 2 was basically a dark comedy interlaced with a few moments of horror. ARMY OF DARKNESS is neither; it's an action/adventure flick filled with comedy and just a touch of gore.<br />The movie begins where EVIL DEAD 2 ended: Ash has been transported to the 13th century and is surrounded by the Army of King Arthur. He is assumed to be a member of a rival army and is taken prisoner. After defeating a couple of Deadites in the pit, he is declared to be the prophecized hero who will rid the kingdom of the evil that has befallen it. However, Ash, being the befuddled hero he is, makes things worse and almost destroys any chance he has of returning home.<br />ARMY OF DARKNESS is hilarious. It's filled with comedy and all sorts of literary and pop culture references from The Three Stooges to Gulliver's Travels to JASON AND THE ARGONAUTS to Frankenstein. I found myself laughing about every three minutes and some of the one-liners just rock: \\"Give me some sugar, baby\\" and \\"I'm going to cut your gizzard.\\" Of course, this movie isn't for everyone. There are some people who would be offended and some who would see this movie as garbage. However, I see the movie as pure genius and great fun. Whatever.

0679805273|5.0|Dr. Seuss is considered to be one of America's best \\"children's\\" authors. However, I don't think the good doctor ever intended to write solely for children. Some of his books were clearly written for youngsters, but most of them, I believe, were written for everyone.<br />Nowhere is this more apparent than in OH, THE PLACES YOU'LL GO! The book is often given as a gift to students as they graduate. But the messages the book contains aren't just for the transitional times of our lives. They are things to remember wherever we go, and whatever we do.<br />Children can profit from reading and listening to the book being read. And sure, the book is filled with the usual zany illustrations and a few never-before-heard-of creatures, situations, and places that kids will enjoy looking at and which may possibly ignite their imagination. But make no mistake, this isn't really a children's book. Kids should be free to be kids and it is only when they are forced to grow up that locations like Lurch, Slump, and The Waiting Place become familiar places. Overall, children cannot understand and comprehend the complexities of life that are described in the book; only adults can do that. Nevertheless, like all great \\"children's\\" literature, this is a story for adults, but filled with lessons that if we remember and have ingrained within us when we are young,  it will help us succeed 98 and 3/4ths of the time.
B00003CXI1|3.0|I feel sorry for the dedicated, well-intended, talented cast and crew that had the daunting task of translating J.K. Rowling's wonderful book to the big screen in a way that would satisfy the millions of fans worldwide that the book franchise has built up. It may have been too much for anyone to pull off.<BR>This IS the best possible movie they could have made of the first Harry Potter book. Except for a few cuts and tightening of the story elements (necessary for length but not helpful for the film), it's really right on target. Unfortunately, no amount of movie magic can top the experience of reading the Harry Potter books. As much as the realization of the settings and characters in the film matched my idea of how they'd look, the simple fact is...they were more alive and real while I was reading the book than they were when they were brought to life on screen.<BR>Don't get me wrong...I'm not a book snob, by any measure. And I liked the movie...saw it twice in the theater. It's just that if you haven't read the book, you should do yourself a favor and buy it and read it. As cool as it was to see so much of it in this film, there real joy of the Harry Potter series seems -- in my experience -- to be in the simple act of reading them.<BR>That's the movie's true weakness...the one \\"special effect\\" it could never contain. It does not absorb you in the charming, intimate wa the book does. For most book-to-movie translations, that's not a problem. But here...it's significant.<br />When I thought about whether or not I'd buy this DVD, I realized that if I wanted to enter that world again, the best possible way to do it was to read the book again, not to watch the movie.
B000002AVF|5.0|Which of course is BUTTERFLY, her most eclectic album to date.  DAYDREAM is really a &quot;fastasy&quot; to listen to.  MC's soaring vocals and soothing music accompanying her is enough for anyone to fall in love with this soulful diva.  Some of them take us to a magical place in our hearts with &quot;Underneath The Stars&quot; and &quot;Daydream Interlude&quot; and others such as &quot;I Am Free&quot;, &quot;One Sweet Day&quot; &amp; &quot;Looking In&quot; are just incredible!  MC also decides to go for a more retro feel in the 50's like &quot;Forever&quot; and the 70's soul-like &quot;Melt Away.&quot;  Then of course is you're dancy/R&amp;B-like numbers like &quot;Fantasy&quot;, &quot;Always Be My Baby&quot;, &quot;Long Ago&quot; and &quot;Daydream Interlude.&quot;  This album is a *must* have for anyone who is a fan of MC's or enjoys pure Pop, R&amp;B, Soul and (some) Jazz.  Overall grade for Mariah's DAYDREAM: A+
B00005RZV4|5.0|i own pretty much every halo that has been released, so i have heard it all before.  typically a live album is just another notch in the cd collection. but this album takes it to the next level. i was hooked 5 seconds into terrible lie, the first track on the cd.  i think it smokes the original recording.  most songs follow the originals enough so that you are not scratching your head wondering what remix you are listening to, but has enough variation in the songs to make them fresh.  I hear a lot of bits and pieces from the remixes in the songs, but it is not overdone.  the sound quality is awesome and the song list is solid.  everyone has their preferences, i would have liked to see some not there and other added, but it is a collection that will make most people happy. order it now, you won't be disappointed.
B00003CXGG|4.0|...I loved this movie. Sure, for the martial arts purists, you wanted more martial arts action, but overall it had the right mix of martial arts, car chases, explosions, and a fresh, edgy feel to it. In the clip on the making of the movie included in the DVD version, the producers wanted to get a fresh unique East meets West, hip hop, kungfu kind of weird appeal and I think they achieved it. I loved Aaliyah, she impressed me with her ability to act, she is so musically talented and has great sex appeal in a cute girl next door type way. Jet was awesome in his fight scenes as usual, but I found myself replaying the DVD and watching the scenes where Aaliyah and Jet interact. There's some chemistry there and hint of romance, but unfortunately that was not fully developed. I thought the plot of these two minority groups having a turf war to be in the realm of possibility. I also found the movie to have some light humor to balance out some of violence and destruction. Maurice, the bumbling foil of the movie was classic. It is an entertaining movie.
B00005U122|5.0|On stage Roger was joined by Doyle Barmhall II (guitar & vocals), Graham Broad (drums), Jon Carin (keyboards, lap steel, programming, guitar & vocals), Andy Fairweather Low (guitar, bass & vocals), Katie Kissoon (vocals), Susannah Melvoin (vocals), P.P. Arnold (vocals), Andy Wallace (Hammond, keyboards) and Snowy White (guitar). The saxophone solos on the tracks are played, in each town, by different people, because they couldn't/wouldn't afford a saxophone player for the whole tour just for one performance.  The DVD starts with In The Flesh , Happiest Days of Out Lives, Another Brick in the Wall (part 2) and Mother (brought tears into my eyes!), all taken from The Wall.<br />The Final Cut album is represented by the lovely acoustic medley of Get Your Filthy Hands of My Desert and Southampton Dock.The Animals album is the next to be visited. It's a shame that Pigs on the Wing (part 1) is not played with the guitar bridge and flowing into Pigs on the Wing (part 2). It seemed appropriate to play it that way with Snowy on stage, but unfortunately only the regular first half is played. What comes next easily makes up for this minor letdown; a full version of Dogs, amazingly well played and with great guest vocals by Jon Carin. A highlight of the album! Next up is a selection from Wish You Were Here. After a fine version of Welcome To The Machine, featuring massive backing vocals, we get the re-arranged version of the title track Wish You Were Here as Waters also used to play it live during the eighties, again with lots of backing vocals. A nice, fresh version of a beautiful song.<br />The version of Shine On You Crazy Diamond which follows is rather strange. Its starts with part 1 and 2, followed by 4 and continuing with part 6 and 7 to finally return part 5 and to the opening section of part 1. A good version nevertheless. The next is a Floyd classic, Set The Control for the Heart of the Sun. A great rendition complete with saxophone solo and a freaky middle section. Then follows Breathe, including the Speak to Me opening of Dark Side of the Moon. Both this song and the next one, Time feature Doyle Bramhall II on guest vocals, although surprisingly enough Waters has chosen to do Gilmour's vocals on Time himself, instead of the less powerful vocals that were originally done by Richard Wright. Although not mentioned on the DVD, Time does end with Breathe Reprise. Bramhall continues guest vocals on Money. The nice thing about Waters' versions of the songs is the even more extensive use of (female) backing vocals on various tracks. Not only do they compensate for a certain lack of volume in Roger's voice, they also add to the power of the performances. And then we get to Roger's solo material. First we are treated to Every Strangers Eyes. Without a doubt, Roger's vocals are no longer strong enough to reach these notes and volumes. We continue with a large chuck of Roger's masterpiece Amused to Death: Perfect Sense (part 1 and 2) ,The Bravery of Being Out Of Range, It's a Miracle and the title track Amused to Death. All songs are played very tight. The encores of the set list were Brain Damage/Eclipse and Comfortably Numb.<br />The DVD closes with a new track, Each Small Candle. The song starts with the backing vocalists and a guitar solo by Snowy White. The song has the same feel as The Tide is Turning and the lyrics, of which the first verse was written by a South American who'd been a victim of torture, are very emotional. Later on the song gets heavier, owning to a more bombastic melody. All in all, this is a very nice package with an interesting mixture of classic Floyd tracks and great solo compositions. The sound is great and very dynamic and performances are of high quality as well.follows Breathe, including the Speak to Me opening of Dark Side of the Moon.

B000022TSH|5.0|I just saw Chinatown for the first time, since I was told that anybody taking a screenwriting class *must* see it. The story is full of tons of little things worth looking at and thinking about. Many minor characters, strange clues, deceits, and double-crosses to be found here. If you ever want to see Jack Nicholson in a good protagonist role, check this movie out. There's really only one scene in the movie where he gets frighteningly violent, and even that's only when he's desperate for some answers. The DVD is reasonbly priced for what you get. You get a great movie made in the classic style of the 1930s, as well as an in-depth documentary which includes interviews with Roman Polanski (director), Robert Towne (writer), and Robert Evans (producer). Screenwriting students, see this movie, or at least read the screenplay! Everybody else, if you like crime movies with interesting surprises, check Chinatown out! Enjoy.
B00005K3OT|4.0|Trouble in demi-Paradise when a free-spirited woman blows into a French village a la Mary Poppins to open up a chocolate store right in the middle of Lent!<br />I didn't know a THING about this movie when I agreed to see it with Sis in Law, but I think she choose very well for us. Juliette Binoche is quite charming as the chocolatiere who's getting everyone worked up but managing to subdue them all with just the right kind of truffle or cocoa. Oh, if life were only so simple in actuality! I especially loved the colors of her clothes in this movie, lovely aquas and salmons. \\"Chocolat\\" is a feast for the eye as well as the mouth (although the mouth part is vicarious, really). Dame Judi is a bit more crotchetty here than usual, but still a great performer. Depp is sexy as a gypsy guy who manages to be slightly a step ahead of Binoche, disconcerting her as the only one who's favorite chocolate she can't quite detect.     <br />I think it's interesting how many other reviewers are angry that Johnny Depp didn't have a larger role than his billing would have you believe, but I think the true qualifier for that dubious honor would be Leslie Caron. I don't think she says two words together in the movie; she just keeps looking over her shoulder to be amazed at finding John Wood there (is that really the strangest thing?).
B00005MP58|5.0|This is an excellent adaptation of Jane Austen's Pride and Prejudice. It stays true to the novel while bringing the characters alive. The casting was very well done. I love Mr. Darcy and Elizabeth-they are similar to the way I pictured them when I was reading the book. Also, Mr. and Mrs Bennet and Mr. Collins are hilarious. Although the miniseries is very long, it does not move slowly-there is always something happening. I did not find myself bored at all throughout the entire six hours. In addition, I enjoyed the extra features-specifically the behind the scenes featurette. The only problem I have with the DVD is that the video and sound quality are not the greatest. At several points the timing of the sound is way off. Also, the video quality has occasional lapses. However, these flaws are minor and they are not enough to make me regret buying this DVD. It is one of my favorites-great actors, scenery, and costumes, and it tells the story in a way that Jane Austen herself would be proud of. I recommend this to all people who like the novels of Jane Austen and to anyone else who enjoys romantic and entertaining movies.
B000055Y0X|5.0|Stanley Kubrick, for the past 5 years or so (ever since I first watched Strangelove), has been a personal idol of mine. And if the average person wants to know what the big deal is about Kubrick, the answer lies within this film.<br />While it's debateable whether this, 2001, or Clockwork is his greatest acheivement on film, I argue that Strangelove contains the most of what we know and love of Kubrick. His combination of satire, black comedy, and the use of unlikely situations to provoke serious thought (and in the meantime poke serious fun) of both society and mankind are all displayed in this one gem. <br />Set (and filmed) in Cold War Era atmosphere, Dr. Strangelove begins when General Ripper (Sterlin Hayden) orders a full scale nuclear attack of The Soviet Union as per a somewhat secretive engagement policy which was put in effect in case of a sneak attack on Washington. His reasoning, because the Communists are attempting to infiltrate America by stealing our &quot;precious bodily fluids&quot; (he later reveals that he came to this conclusion when failing at the physical act of lovemaking).<br />This sets about a series of episodes in which Slim Pickens (Major Kong) and his B-52 Bomber Crew attempt to evade &quot;The Ruskies&quot; and hit their target, another in which Colonel Mandrake (Peter Sellers) a British Military officer sets about to stop Ripper, and the last in which the Russians and Americans set about to stop the tragedy through the last possible lines of diplomacy in The War Room (no fighting allowed). It's in the War Room where most of the action takes place, staggering between brilliant performances by Sellers again as The U.S. President, George C. Scott as General Buck Turgidson, and yet Sellers again as the mysterious title character Dr. Strangelove.<br />If you have seen any highlight reels of the greatest scenes in film, then you are no doubt aware of the brilliant climax in this one, but I won't spoil it for you. Dr. Strangelove is considered by many (myself included) to be one of the greatest films ever made, and for that alone is worth your purchase.
B00004Z459|4.0|Linkin Parks debut album has not only become popular among rock/alternative listeners, but has gained the appeal of many other fans of other genres such as rap and hip-hop. The album consists of emotionally-driven performances that combine rock and hip-hop influences to form a unique sound that Linkin Park can call their own. Hybrid Theory consists of great memorable tracks throughout the albumtracks that listeners will not get tired of listening. In addition to its number one single, In the End, the album contains many other hits such as One Step Closer and Crawling, for which the band has won a Grammy for the Best Hard Rock Performance. Not only has Linkin Park gained a vast fan base with its hits, but their unique mix of style and beats has given rise to other new artsists following the alternative/hip-hop sounds of Linkin Park. I believe the collaboration of lead vocals Chester Benningtons sexy soft and screaming hard voice and rapper Mike Shinodas smooth vocals make this unforgettable album a must-buy.
B00005QZ7U|5.0|I intended the title of this review to be a play on the 4 Cs of a diamond (cut, color, clarity, carat).  Indeed, this is a gem of a film.  I thought it was an ingenious way of reinventing the modern day musical.  I further appreciated the film after seeing the making of it in the Special Features section.<br />This film is about a penniless writer, Christian, that falls in love with a courtesan named Satine.  But Satine has responsibilities to her boss Zidler and benefactor the Duke.  This is how the love triangle is set up.  Look past the fact that the plot is quite cliche and simple.  Once you see that Nicole Kidman and Ewan McGreggor do have on-screen chemistry and can actually sing, you'll be amazed.<br />This DVD set comes with 2 discs.  The first disc contains the movie as well as a behind the scenes option that allows you to look behind the scenes for certain sequences in the film.  The second disc contains everything but the kitchen sink.  It has interviews with the cast, the making of the music, the making of the sets, still images by professional photographers of the making of the movie, a scrap book of the story, complete/extended/multi-cam featurettes of the major dance sequences in the film (like the can can, tango, coup d'etat, hindi, etc.), music videos of the Lady Marmalade song.<br />It took me a full 8 hrs. to go through all the material and I never felt bored.  Baz terms this film as the conclusion of a trilogy of red curtain movies, after Strictly Ballroom and Romeo and Juliet.  I have yet to see Strictly Ballroom, but I have no doubt that Baz Luhrmann's talent for story telling will leave me mesmerized as well.<br />LEAP rating (each out of 5):<BR>============================<BR>L (Language) - 4 (all the major dialogues are in the form of songs from the 80's)<BR>E (Erotica) - 2 (surprisingly it was sexy in a humorous, light way)<BR>A (Action) - 0 (n/a)<BR>P (Plot) - 3 (it is a cliche plot, but well told nonethless)
B0000524CY|5.0|..and to this very day, no other horror film has come close to presenting filmlovers with a masterly blend of intelligence, class and sophistication with horrific, disturbing and balls to the wall terror, as The Exorcist does. Although imitated many times, it still remains a one of a kind film. Can anyone name a single film, other than The Exorcist, that was aimed for a mature audience, giving us an intelligent presentation, all the while bombarding us with shocks and gore at a level that's rarely been reached in cinema. I can't think of one. That this film has been debated, discussed, analized, summarized, scoffed at, adored, imitated and written about for a consecutive 30 years tells you all you need to know. It is flat out the singular masterpiece of modern horror. Maybe younger audiences are indeed laughing at it these days, but go to any horror chat room (where lots of young people dwell) and discover which film gets discussed the most often. It's amazing that a film that \\"didn't scare them\\" gets the most deep conversations going. From what I've observed about recent horror films, I truly believe these young people's kids and grandkids will be admiring the The Exorcist when their time comes. Unfortunately, not since 1973 has there been a horror film really worth an in-depth discussion....and I think you all know what I mean. I prefer the original version, but the \\"new\\" version is also great.
6305609705|1.0|It may be a classic to many people, but only sheer will and determination allowed me to sit through it.  It was horrible.  It was long, boring, and pointless.  The director intended this film to showcase the different facets of war and the madness that it brings to some people.  I should've known the madness was intended for his audience.<br />The story is about Captain Willard (Martin Sheen) on a mission to find and execute the highly decorated and brilliant renegade Colonel Kurtz (Marlon Brando), who has turned mad (undoubtedly because of war).<br />Please don't waste 3 hours of your life watching this movie.<br />LEAP rating (each out of 5):<BR>============================<BR>L (Language) - 3 (writers get all philosophical and artsy with Brando's lines)<BR>E (Erotica) - 0 (n/a)<BR>A (Action) - 2 (doesn't force you to the edge of your seats, that's for sure)<BR>P (Plot) - 1 (Sheen is sent into Cambodia to hunt down Brando, plain and simple)
0783117523|4.0|I saw this movie orginally on HBO , then got hold of the unrated version on VHS , the one thing I can't figure out is why they didn't bring out the unrated version on DVD , this is the on aspect of DVDs that I love, you can put all the additives as well as the movie on this media , they should have brought this one out with the orginal version and unrated version available , then I would have bought it in a second.
B00005YXZH|1.0|I didn't buy this CD. I didn't buy Summerteeth. After \\"Being There\\", I found it difficult to get excited about anything Tweedy did. Based on all these so called reviews, you'd think Wilco was the second coming of the Beatles. This CD embodies everything that drove me away from mainstream music towards roots, alt country, or whatever you want to call it. All this synthesized stuff bites it. This isn't a guitar band anymore.  This music has no soul or passion. The only thing it might be good for is insomnia. I'll stick with old Tupelo, Jayhawks, and Jay Farrar. If you really want to hear a new CD that rocks, check out Bottle Rockets \\"Songs of Sahm\\".
0385335482|5.0|If you are a single woman who whenever has a bad day goes shopping in order to feel better, YOU MUST READ THIS BOOK. It was recommended by a friend and I finished it in two days. I am actually now passing it to my roommate, who is the Suze in my apartment. <BR>You will love it!!!!!!
B00005QG9J|3.0|Though incubus is one of my alltime favorite bands, i can't bring myself to say that I like this CD. Musically it's wonderful. But they don't seem to have the same energy or creativity that they used. It's more like they set limitations for themselves and want to be more sophisticated about it. I know a band must advance through time, keep searching new ground, but I miss the youthful musical creativity that they demonstrated in Fungus Amongus and SCIENCE. Some people may say &quot;oh, they're just being more mature and better musically&quot; or something like that. Those people must be forgeting their medication. More mature, maybe; musically, not at all. If you listen to Fungus Amongus, or especially SCIENCE. You realize that the beat, the harmony, vocals, instrumentals, transitions, just everything is orchestrated so brilliantly, its almost flawless in that sense. I love incubus, but I'm not sure I like the direction they're heading in.
B00003CXPJ|5.0|No one was more afraid of &quot;Zoolander&quot; then I was. It looked like Hollywood, as feared, was turning into a factory pumping out one stupid flick after another, and it was taking Ben Stiller along with it. It looked like a bad take off on all of the goofy, dumb humor flicks we have grown to know and love. I was forced into renting one evening, and then forced to watch it (as though the thought of renting it did not torture me enough). Oddly, I found myself laughing throughout the whole movie, and it quickly won my heart.<br />Zoolander soon turned into a delightfully stupid romp following Derek Zoolander [Stiller] and his journey to find himself. The cast of supporting characters only add to the joy in &quot;Zoolander&quot;, with people such as Owen Wilson, Will Ferrel, Jerry Stiller and Christine Taylor.<br />The plot basically simmers down to the following:<br />Male model Derek Zoolanders career is no longer on the rise, and seems to be dimishing in comparison to the &quot;new kid on the block&quot; male model Hansel [Wilson]. He decides to go in search of what he is meant for because there must be more to life than &quot;being really really ridiculously good looking&quot;. Meanwhile, a fashion designer Mugatu [Ferrel] is trying to find a dumb male model to knock off the president of Malaysia, and sets his sights on Derek. Meanwhile, a female journalist [Taylor] is trying to help Derek escape the grips of Mugatu.<br />A great movie for a rental with friends evening, or a party, will surely get a laugh or two, even from the most cynical of viewers.
B00005O3VC|5.0|Bloody brilliant! Packed with so many extras they needed a second disc! From subtitles for those who don't like the movie to Japanese and Lego versions, plus brand new features, and 24 rarely seen seconds, a fan could easily spend a whole weekend watching nothing else.<br />Plus the picture quality is so much better...it truly does make Ben Hur look like an Epic.
B00005QZ7U|5.0|When I began to watch this movie, I was weary of what it would become. It immediately throws you into the bright colors, the dark characters and the mystery and wonder of the world our characters live in. The first 20 minutes are not only the most exciting, but the most shocking, intense and disturbing. Although the movie is a delight, there is no easy way to introduce the viewer to the extreme pace and the intensity at which it plays. One realizes that you are being brought through this world through the eyes of innocent Christian (McGregor), who experiences all the feelings that the viewer feels each moment along the way.<br />Surprisingly, I discovered Moulin Rouge! to be a delightful movie watching experience for many different reasons. Not only was it brilliant to look at, but the story moved along well and the acting was as full and vibrant as the songs and setting. The flawless incorporation of modern songs in this turn of the century setting was amazingly tasteful. Along with the voices they were sung by, new, refreshing and...powerful! Who know Ewan McGregor, semi-god of independent films could sing too? <br />The basic plot of Moulin Rouge! has been done time and time again, but rarely with such flare and style. Nicole Kidman and Ewan McGregor have amazing chemistry together and you can feel as they connect on screen. Although Nicole does her famous, never-ending exploration of her lovers face with her eyes, never looking them directly in the eye, but up and down, over and out...etc. it suits her character and personality.<br />A beautifully done, and carefully thought out film, that I would highly suggest to anyone that is willing to push through the first 20 minutes. For it is truly &quot;so exciting the audience will stopm and cheer, and so delighting it will run for fifty years.&quot;
B00005YXZH|5.0|I love it. Deep, soaring with good pop sensibilities. Listen closely the first time or two, it's not a good CD to play while housecleaning until you know the music.
6304147589|5.0|This is no more a 'Western' than Heart of Darkness is an 'African'.   Like The Deer Hunter, and even more successfully, it<BR>is a political parable, describing the tensions between American<BR>idealism and the realities of American power.  It is one of a group of movies, mostly made in the seventies, which gave us real insight into the Matter of America -- the constant tensions between what we believe ourselves to be and what we actually are.<BR>The group of absentee cattlemen -- British and North Eastern<BR>brahmins -- who make decisions which affect the life of real,<BR>working people -- continue to stand for the tensions which still exist between the North Eastern axis of Boston/New York/<BR>Washington whose contempt for the American heartland and the struggles of her people have actually increased in recent years.  To see this movie as a failed western is to see Apocalypse Now as a failed war movie or Citizen Kane as a failed biopic.  There was real anger, real, visceral understanding of the differences between Federal Government corruption and big business decisions and the interests of the people they pretended to represent.  Cimino was as instinctive a film maker as Kubrick but unfortunately didn't have the benefit of being<BR>exiled to England, along with Kramer and a few others, by political forces which Hollywood has rarely had the nerve or the intelligence to resist. Hollywood hasn't yet come to terms with the betrayals of McCarthyism and its terrible desertion of black activists like Paul Robeson, let alone its contemptible treatment of serious film makers. Like Orson Wells,  Cimino was sacrificed for his politics, not his ego and like Wells he was never able to capture the coherence of his early work..  He was trying to do something as new and important as Ford did in Grapes of Wrath, but the tide was already turning against him and it seems it suited the powers that be to pretend he had 'destroyed' a studio when many other directors have had as bad financial failures (Von Stroheim and the Scarlet Empress bombed as badly, Wizard of Oz was a box office flop when it first appeared, for instance and Hawks and Hepburn lost their contracts after Bringing Up Baby).  If the studio had promoted Heaven's Gate for the fine film it was, they probably would have recouped their money by now.  People who fail to understand its virtues, fail to understand the cinema itself.  They want only sensation and sentimentality, which Hollywood continues to celebrate and reward, not serious<BR>adult cinema.
B00005QDW1|1.0|First Of All. I Like ROCK music. Hi Im Gwen Stefani and I am a ROCK chic. I really like ROCK  music and I am in ROCK group called No Doubt. Pleeeeaaaaaaassssseeeeee. First of all<BR>this cd is no rock music. 2nd their other cds Tragic Kingdom and the album which was released after that werent rock cds either. And the music that they were playing and are now doing isnt rock music and Gwen Stefani is probably the most untalented lady singers out there and her voice is so anoying and her fake blonde hair doesnt help anything. The lyrics are stupid. The worst of all this album doesnt include any song that I actually like except for Hella Good. None of them does really matter and they are the most mealingless [junk]. Two weeks ago I saw MTV 20 years in rock history (or something like that) and she was on and sayed well the year 2000 or 2001 has been a bit slow on Rock music but we hope that rock nroll will go higher. Hmmmmm and what does she do she writes a song called Hey Baby. Hey Baby , Hey Baby with computer sound to it. I like computers and I like electronics beats as well but I dont want to call that rock nroll music or a girl with terrible voice and terrible lyrics (shes what 35).<BR>Who cant sing nor dance and just babbles around get so good reviews sorry but this is my opinion of this group who only have one song that will be remembered and the only song that would have made them famous (Dont Speak)
B000001FI7|5.0|As a whole Dummy is an amazing debut album from Portishead.  Along with Massive Attack this band helped to inspire a similar sound in many other bands.  Still there is something unique about Portisheads music that still makes it stand out from everything else out there.  Many of the samples and instruments they use are seemingly odd picks yet help to enhance the music all the more.  Beth Gibbons has an amazing voice, and the sound of the music is what makes it so great.  It is on the downbeat side, probably comparable to Radiohead in the fact that some people will enjoy the music while others will think it depressing.  Still I enjoy this album, and listen to it constantly and find more to love every time I play it.  <br />Mysterons, Strangers, and Roads are my favorite tracks.<br />Their next album is also excellent, though if you found the first one to depressing you might not want to look into the second.
B000000WA4|5.0|Well when I bought this album back in 97 after hearing it at a friends house I was blown away. This 2 cd set includes 28 great tunes. All the songs here are briliant. Some of them are hard, some beautiful , Some hilarious other just nice to listen to. This is indeed a great album. No wonder it was so popular and There are still people buying it which is really rare not only is it 7 years old but it his a double album. If you dont have this album I suggest you buy it. And the blocket is nice too.
B000003TSP|4.0|I love this ablum, sometimes I like it better than Dummy, or Vice Versa, so much depends on my mood.  The only reason I did not give it five stars is because it takes repeated listenings to get accustomed to this album.  A lot of people say it's darker and more depressing, the vocals are more pinched, distorted at times and overall the sound seems even more subdued.  Overall though it is still an excellant album, especially when it comes to experiementing with sounds.  <br />Undenied, Half Day Closing, and Western Eyes are all great tracks
B00005YW4H|4.0|Nice voice and nice lyrics.  Sometimes a little country, but good overall.
0446608955|5.0|The book that I read was called &quot;A Walk to Remember&quot; by Ncholas Sparks. This book was about this girl Jammie Sullivan, who wasn't one of the popular kids, and Landon Carter, who was one of the popular kids. Jammie's father was a Reverend at their church who was very protective of his daughter. Landon's father was a congress man who was hardly around. They had to learn to work with each other in the school play that they were going to preform, and they did.<BR>   The thing that I liked most about this book was the characters. This is because Jammie Sullivan and Landon Carter came from two different backrounds, and they had to learn to get along and work together. <BR>   I thought that this was a really great book. It was really interesting and the author made it easy yo understand. I would recomened this book to anyone because of those reasons.
B00003CXIP|5.0|Rob Reiner gave the world a great gift in 1986, in celluloid, a little film that shook the world called &quot;Stand By Me&quot;. Sixteen years later, the single thought that comes to mind in watching this movie is how absolutely timeless this movie is. Which is surprising, considering how important the late 1950's is crucial to the movie.<br />The plot, a journey of four boyhood friends in search of their mortality, is simple and profoundly inspiring. How meaningful for these boys at the genesis of their lives, just learning some of life's most endearing and difficult lessons.  We travel along with them, learn along with them, all the while reflecting on our own long lost friends, and the so-important impact they had on our formative years. This movie celebrates what we once were, and brings us back, if only momentarily, to the time when life wasn't about mortgages or cars breaking down, but spending time with our friends, quite possibly, the people we adored more than our own family.<br />The DVD is marvelous and well worth the price. A documentary shares many insights into making the film, and interviews the remaining boys ,with a touching tribute to the late River Phoenix, who's performance was critical to this movie. The music video was fun to see. However, I found Rob Reiner's commentary to be somewhat minimal. At one point he comments how many memories watching this movie stirs up, but he doesn't elaborate. I wanted to hear more, hear everything....<br />Because this movie had so much personal impact, it's hard to know if it would effect others in the same way. But, in watching this movie, one of my personal favorites, it is only clear that it does. And thanks to Mr. Reiner for this gift.
B000063USY|5.0|The Fast and the Furious has become one of my favorite movies of all time. I never get tired of watching this action packed movie over and over again. Paul Walker and Vin Diesel give great performances, the cars are beautiful, and the plot is amazing.

B000009O8A|3.0|Camille Keaton is a pretty young writer from the city who spends the summer in the backwoods to write her first novel. As all genre fans know, four rednecks rape and leave her for dead, but she slowly recovers and plans her bloody revenge. One of the most infamous films of all time, I Spit on Your Grave features no less than three rape scenes and an almost non-stop barrage of full frontal female nudity, but it actually wants to take its subject matter seriously, and it does work to an extent, but peters out in its unbelievable and silly finale. Keaton is, however, superb as the victim who takes charge against her abusers. Only recommended to the very curious (and even then, you better have a STRONG stomach).<BR>** 1/2 out of *****
B00005QG9J|4.0|Incubus is likely one of the only important bands that will survive the rise and fall of the vastly overblown &quot;rap-metal&quot; genre (along with perhaps the other great band of this genre...the deftones).  This is a great album which shows the bands range and maturity.  The last song &quot;aqueous transmission&quot; (sic?) is an amazing rock song.  Clearly the best Incubus album thus far...
0440219078|4.0|The book the giver by Lois Lowry is about an 11-year-old boy named Jonas who lives in a community which is completely different from our society. The community is controlled by the committee  of Elders. There is no fear, no pain and no war. At the Ceremony of Twelve where the 12-year-olds receive their assignments, Jonas is chosen to be the new Receiver of Memories. It is the most honoured job in the community. The Giver, an old man, transmits the memories of the past to Jonas. He and the Giver are the only ones who have these memorys. Jonas receives memories of nature, of joy, pain, colors and feelings like love. After receiving all these memories, he begins to understand that life in his community is strictly ordered and manipulated. Because of this he decides to leave his community with the hope to give the members their memories back. The ending of the book is open, because we do not know  if the members get their memorys back or not and if Jonas has a new, better life then.<br />Lowry's intention is to make the readers aware of the world they live in and to warn them of an oppressive regime.<BR>The characters in the book are all the same. There are no differences between them. Jonas and the Giver are exceptions. <BR>For German people, the giver is difficult to read except you are a person who is very good at English like  English teachers.<BR>The Giver is structured chronologically. The author Lois Lowry does not write anything about the setting at the beginning of the book. You are thrown into the story.<BR>At the beginning of the book it was difficult for me to read it, because there were many new English words which I do not know . First I did not like this book ,because you are thrown into the story and do not know anything about the setting. But when I read it further, it became more and more exciting. It was interesting for me to experience what it is like to live in such a community which is full of rules, manipulation and no chance to change something.It makes me think about our society and how I would respond if I were in Jonas situation. All in all I would say that The Giver is very good. I would give it 4 stars.
B00004Y87I|4.0|Probably one of Danny kayes best known movies, and never seems to lose it's charm. A very thin story line is beautifully padded by the multiple personalities played out in the daydreams of our erstwhile anti-hero. A wonderful cameo from Boris Karloff adds to the comic excitement of a fast paced story, and Kaye delivers brilliantly with impeccable timing during each sub plot. Almost a multiple picture in picture movie, the ending really holds no suprises, but gently jogs the viewer along, without some of the kitch so prevalent in other movies of the era. Danny Kaye really was a comic genius, and in some ways the picture reflects his own life which was widely believed to be that of a painfully shy and reserved man. A great family film, my daughters aged 12 and 14 actually stayed glued to the film throughout, proving that &quot;old fashioned&quot; homely family films can stand the test of time with contemporary audiences. A worthy addition to any collection.
B00005JKED|5.0|I thought this movie was great and i don't know why evry one who didn't like it frankely didnt like. Its if it was to hard for them well tuff because thats what its like out there thats what it looks like and thats how most things work mabey not the hole good cop and bad thing  but every thing els happens and the resone hawk smoked the ...[marijuana] was because he was pressured so he smoked it thats why he didnt go back because his job would be gone and what could he prove...
6305265666|5.0|My whole family watched this movie together and we loved it. We had very little by way of expectations but we were all thoroughly charmed by the humor, romance and lush backgrounds. I usually sell my DVDs after I watch them but I'm going to save this one.
B00005NTJM|4.0|Many Tull fans are more into the 70's progressive/conceptual material Tull put forth on Aqualung and beyond. I prefer the early period(This Was, Stand Up,Benefit)which showcases a more blues and jazz roots based sound, and the later 70's folky acoustic stuff(Songs From The Wood,Heavy Horses, Stormwatch) as well. This Was is very different from all the other Tull albums, mostly due to the prescence of original guitarist Mick Abrahams (only Tull album he appeared on). Abrahams even gets to sing a lead vocal on one cut,something no other member would do after Ian Anderson took total control (Abrahams was the original co-leader and more of a blues purist). In essence,the title may be the most appropriate in retrospect,Tull was never exactly the same again.And what about that claghorn!!!
B00005RY7X|5.0|I don`t know. I`ve listened to TOOL and The Manics and other message-bearing bands for forever and a day. I am usually very quick to criticise this kind of music as a waste of time...but AWK is great. The first time I hard Party Hard I just kind of stood there for a couple of seconds before I cranked up the volume ... It`s so refreshing just to hear someone who wants to make music for the fun of it and not to complain about society, [messed] up relationships, or deep-seated internal turmoil. Who cares if it`s noisy and shallow. Just relax, get into it (it isn`t that hard), and enjoy it for what it is!!
0440219078|3.0|The Giver written by Lois Lowry is about society and humanity. The main role is played by Jonas who lives in a community with Sameness\\". Jonas thinks that he lives in a normal world and that he has a normal life in the community until his 12th birthday when he becomes a Receiver of Memories. As a Receiver of Memories he receives memories which are transmitted by the Giver. These memories contain feelings or colours. After that Jonas recognizes that the community is controlled and that everybody has to obey the rules. Nobody in the community knows what feelings or colours are, except Jonas. He cannot bear the situation that nobody  has an individuality in the Community and that is the reason why he escapes in the end. You can clearly see Jonas  changing in the book. At the beginning he is happy and satisfied with his life, but trough receiving memories he changes and becomes more critical and more complex. The message of this Text is to make readers aware of the world they live in. I think everybody has a right to be individual and free. And everybody can decide for himself and nobody should change this. I read the Giver only once. The themes in the Giver are interesting, but the end does not meet my expectations. Because I would like to Know what happens with Jonas in the end, when he is in front of the house. This open ending does not say something about this. Because of this I give only  3 STARS.
B000002N3N|5.0|This is positively one of the best albums ever released by Enya.  This album is filled with such powerful songs as 'Pax Deorum' and 'La Sonadora' that you will never want to listen to anything else.  From the very first song, 'The Memory of Trees', you will be enthralled and drawn by the music of this album.  These tunes are great to listen to when you are feeling down or sad, or pretty much any time.  These songs will captivate your heart with their powerful message and make you not want to let go or turn it off. <br />I would suggest this album to any Enya fan right away, and even to those who have never heard Enya sing before.  You will get a great impression of her songs and be more interested to buy her other albums.
0345350472|5.0|Even though it's fairly short, this book contains many situations and themes left out of the film version. Some of the most fascinating aspects of the novel are the future civilization's politics, religion, and standards of society. Many unexpected things happen and the outcome is a real surprise (the hunt for the androids seems to be a minor sub-plot. The main issues are much more intriguing.)  This is one of Philip K. Dick's most interesting and coherent novels.
B00005R2M3|5.0|I love the combination of music from all over the world. Wild Rythms and great lyrics!! Definately worth the purchase!
B00005YXZH|4.0|I suspect that at least some of the people reading these reviews have already listened to YHF, are devoted Wilco fans via the alt-country scene or whatever, and are simply curious to know what other people have to say about Jeff and co's latest effort, having already formed their own opinion.  Indeed, a few days after listening to the CD I read the reviews that had been written up to that point in the same spirit, and wanted to agree with the overall praise given to the CD.  I've been thinking about the CD for almost a week now, however, and thought I might contribute a small dissenting opinion.  My overall opinion is that YHF is a sometimes-adventuresome CD that has some very strong tracks.  But I would hardly consider the CD to constitute a huge advance for the group (or what's left of it).  I think the argument over the album's merits hinges upon its experimental texture, which is nothing devoted fans of sparklehorse, radiohead, etc. haven't heard before.  In the case of YHF, however, these effects are by and large gratuitous.  I except the first song and last two songs from this opinion.  I can hardly complain, however, because the effects do tend to make several rather mediocre songs somewhat more interesting and therefore enjoyable than they otherwise might be.  Musically, then, the CD has its hits and misses.  It's the misses that trouble me, among which should include those peppy songs like &quot;heavy metal drummer&quot; that are nice, but hardly fare for a Great Albums (pet sounds, seargent pepper's, who's next) comparison.  And am I the only one that finds Tweedy's lyrics banal?  Just because they resist paraphrase and are occasionally neat hardly grants them status as lyric poetry.  I speak from the position of one who has a ph.d. in contemporary poetry.  As a person who is totally open to the new, old, and whatever, YHF is, in my opinion, a good album that hardly deserves the &quot;classic&quot; moniker being given it here.  Listen, enjoy, and hope forsomething better next time around.
B000001Y79|4.0|The best thing about this CD is that its original. If there are other bands like it I havent found them yet. Its cool.<BR> Still, at first I thought this CD was weird. I had to teach myself to like it. If you read my other reviews, youll see that this isnt like anything else I listen to, so thats part of the reason. I had to listen to this CD 3 or 4 times before I started enjoying it very much. I was used to headband music, and I had to learn that you get a different kind of enjoyment out of this CD. But I did learn to enjoy it. Gwen has a great voice, and the band itself is pretty talented. The songs are nothing really special, since they're usually cute love songs, but the lyrics are still usually clever, if not masterful. I like almost all the songs. Chances are you've heard Im Just a Girl. Not all the songs are like that, but thats pretty much what No Doubt is like. They're sort of punk, sort of reggae, sort of I dont even know. But they're cool. Bottom line:if you're a headbanger, dont touch. If you like punk or reggae with a different twist, buy it.
0440219078|1.0|In the book The Giver\\" the author Lois Lowry describes life in a community which is completely different from our society. The 12-year-old main character Jonas is chosen to be the new Receiver of Memory whose task it is to contain all the memories of the past. All other members of the community live without memories. The community controls and watchs over what everybody does in the community. People do not feel any pain or other things and the people in the community cannot see colours or choose on their own. The Giver transmits the memories to Jonas and will be released when he has finished. At the end of the book Jonas and Gabe leave the community, because he cannot bear his life in the community.<BR>Jonas and his family live in a dwelling. Jonas is a typical child of the community who plays with friends, attends school and does volunteer work. Jonas cannot speak to anyone only with the Giver who gives him the memories. Jonas feels lonely, because he cannot understand his friends and the people. Jonas has his own opinion on everything and he sees the community from another view. He has many qualities for example intelligence, integrity and courage. <BR>The book has an open ending so that the reader can imagine his / her own ending. With the book \\"The Giver\\" Lois Lowry wants to say that people need freedom and memories and not control. People independent on the community, and this is not right. They must be independent and they must have feelings to go their own ways.<BR>I do not like this book, because it is too unrealistic for me. The book does not have any tension and it is difficult to read. The book is not interesting. And the open ending is stupid, because it does not say anything. The book is so boring that I would not read it if I did not have to read it.
0425129608|5.0|This book is set in a lonely seaside resort in England with a very mixed cast of characters, from the rich clothing-designer Rosamund Darnley to the garrulous American Mrs. Gardner to the beautiful man-chaser Arlena Stuart and her husband Captain Kenneth Marshall.  Arlena's reputation of beauty and ruining marriages precedes her and indeed she does have an affair with young Patrick Redfern at the resort, despite his marriage to Christine Redfern.  Therefore, when Arlena is killed, there is a long list of suspects: Kenneth Marshall, Patrick Redfern, Christine Redfern, and Linda Marshall (Arlena's step-daughter).  Hercule Poirot, the famous Belgian detective, is at the resort and discovers the murderer in a completely unexpected ending. <BR> I love the suspense of this book and the way all of the little seemingly insignificant clues eventually come together, leaving me amazed at the brilliance of Agatha Christie.  I read this book in about two days because I couldn't put it down.  This is definitely one of the best Agatha Christie books that I have ever read and I highly recommend it to anyone who likes a great mystery.
B0000028M7|5.0|I think that I wrote a review of this album a while back, but with the recent passing of Layne Staley, I rediscovered all of my old Alice In Chains albums, especially this, their absolute masterpiece.  Everything that made the band so perfect, so immensely listenable is here--the sizzling rhythm section of bassist Mike Starr and drummer Sean Kinney (an amazing, but sadly underrated talent) and of course Layne and Jerry, both of whom create beautiful vocal harmonies here and get some great sounds out of their guitars.  I've often heard this album described as being \\"so depressing,\\" and so forth by many music fans and critics alike, but despite the pictures painted of the seamy side of life and of the addiction cycle, the music and lyrics are absolutely brilliant. Layne Staley was probably one of the best songwriters to come out of the \\"grunge era,\\" and Jerry Cantrell is pretty darn good too.  Most of the songs are co-written by the pair, and songs such as \\"Sickman,\\" \\"Junkhead,\\" and \\"God Smack\\" do open Layne's diaries of addiction for public consumption, but like all great works of art--music, literature, whatever--the lyrics take the listener to a place that he or she otherwise would not have known about.
B00005JKDQ|5.0|This is by far the most exciting animated movie I and the kids have ever seen. We just loved it. I would reccomened this movie to anyone, even adults. This is a pure family movie. One that everyone of all ages can enjoy.
B000000OQF|5.0|I realize many people have praised this album, but it definitely deserves it.  I read that it still sells significantly almost 15 years after its original release. Rather than give some standard review, here are some personal reflections.  Back when I was a teenager and had no money, my schoolfriend made a cassette copy for me.  I listened to it on my walkman almost constantly everywhere I went.  I memorized every lyric and can recite the song order in less than 10 seconds.  I stayed up late listening to AFD and drove my parents crazy.  I know every one of Slash's and Izzy's guitar parts and every Adler drum beat, every single one of Axl's vocal inflections. It's So Easy's bass intro is classic. I was always intrigued by the part in Paradise City where there's an echo in the chorus.  I eventually bought three or four more cassette copies before buying my first CD copy in '94 when I didn't even have a CD player.  I had to buy another copy because that one just became too scratched.  Worth every penny.  I'm just so sorry I never saw them live.
B000000YBQ|5.0|Only McCoy Tyner rivals Bill Evans for the throne as Most Important Pianist of our generation, and this disc lives up to every expectation one might have for an artist of this sort of billing. It's almost an act of arrogance to presume to review this album, but this work really defines what ought to be happening in any trio setting, so tight, such great artistic intimacy among Evans, Scott Lafaro, and Paul Motian. You can slip this disc into your player and just sit back and know you're going to be carried away.
B000002KAT|5.0|This album doesn't have the immediate payoff of a single... a real rarity for Van. If you like his poppy, fun songs, I'd recommend one of his greatest hits collections.<br />This album is thoughtful and mellow... very powerfully evocative. His voice is so resonant and supple. There's just something important he wants to tell you... you can tell by hearing him. It has the power and emotion of gospel music or soul music... but mellow and golden like a good Irish whiskey.<br /> The backing is a laid-back, folky jazz that has a remarkable timeless sound. Listen to the sample of 'Sweet Thing'. That's a very indicative song... also the most accessible.
B000002HH2|5.0|This was my first introduction to the mysterious world of Bjork and is still my favorite. Aside from people's claims of it being post-pop or whatever, to me it's and adventurous mixture of triphop, string arrangements, curious electronics, and calm ambience. It can go from intense techno club journeys like &quot;Army Of Me&quot; and &quot;Enjoy&quot; (the latter being a lavish experiment and a particular fave of mine) to more meditating melodramas like &quot;Cover Me&quot;, done to soft Asian instruments and such, or the last song which lulls you into sleep as the song's lyrics suggest. &quot;It's So Quiet&quot; is an amusing broadway cover and definitely worth checking out, but for my money nothing beats the best track on the entire album, &quot;Isobel&quot;...it's a spooky jungle-filled rainforest romp of bombastic music, which has Bjork relating her lust-filled tale of loving a mystified replica of herself. The distant whistling at the end is a nice touch. &quot;Possibly Maybe&quot; is one of the lighter meditative joints in the album, mixed with some Hungarian violins; &quot;Hyper-Ballad&quot; makes me feel like I'm jumping off a high cliff in the clouds, humming all the way down which matches the song's lyrics about suicide and a similar fantasy. And to think most suicidal music that drives people off cliffs is depressing, but not Bjork's. Her dwellings in love, desperation, etc. are always weird, upbeat, or uncategorizable. She is truly a unique heroine in modern day music.
B00005JKBC|5.0|I loved the movie and think the extras on this DVD were superb.  Unfortunately, I have a Toshiba player and had the problem of having the captions coming on all the time.  I hated the idea of returning the DVD, being as I loved the movie so much.  So, I began to search for a solution.  On a DVD forum, I saw something someone had posted.  To get the closed captioning to disappear, go to the bonus materials section of the DVD and turn on the Clandestine Ops option.  Classified folder icons will pop up occasionally, but they are a lot less obtrusive than the constant closed captioning.  I hope this helps, and, more importantly, I hope Amazon posts this review.
B000002KAT|2.0|I was already a fan of Van from his Moondance album (which I rank among the top 10% of all classic rock albums I own) when I picked up Astral Weeks ...   But after giving it several chances I've found nothing special about it.<br />The music conveys a languid mood that shifts back and forth between blues and jazz.  That's good, but there's nothing novel in the arrangement and there are no standout performances.  The music's simply adequate.  Same with the lyrics.  They don't reach out to themes of social consciouness, fire the imagination with evocations of time and place, or touch upon fundamental truths of the human experience.  The best lyricists of the late 60s and early 70s did this.  Morrison achieves it on Moondance.  On Astral Weeks one track (Like Young Lovers Do) comes close, but the rest are just someone singing.  Without anything special happening musically or lyrically, the album is simply mediocre.<br />...
B00005UKKF|3.0|Interesting show, but it's not a music concert. All that lip- synch makes me boring to watch, very lame. Fans always saying \\"That's not a point, the point is she's stage presence and talent\\" Well...remember, she's a well-trained-by-a-big-company-performer. how anyone can be a talented singer if he or she doesn't singing at all? <br />I coudn't find any musical elements in this massive show, It really feels like watching a big music video, not a 'concert'<br />Aside from that big disappoinment. It's a very enjoyable show. fun to watch...That's why I give it a 3 star. Recommended if you are dedicated fan of her, or fan of visually well-constructed show like me. But don't expect any musical experience.<br />If you looking for a concert has both 'show' and real 'Music' at the same time, then try Madonna's 'Drowned the world tour' DVD.<BR>She believes every single breathe.
0375507507|5.0|I found this book after falling in love with Africa reading The Poisonwood Bible.  I was even happier when I discovered it was the true story of &quot;Bobo's&quot; childhood experiences growing up in Rhodesia during a civil war.  I couldn't put it down and even before I finished it, I started reading it over from the beginning.  The personal photos add a nostalgic touch to each chapter and make the descriptions in the book come to life.  I highly recommend this book to anyone looking for a roller coaster of emotional experiences and an exceptional read.

014028009X|1.0|This is one of those dreadful books that is passed around the office by women who think of themselves as 'one of the girls'.  Don't be fooled into identifying yourself with this novel; here's why:  The few and rather flimsy reasons women think they identify with Bridget are that she's overweight, though the author is careful to slip in (lest you identify the character with her) between the exaggerations that this is only a matter of about ten pounds.  Or else that Bridget is single, thirty-something, and feeling the societal pressures of settling down with a man.  At worst, there's an association akin to being pulled in by hokey cigarette advertisements from the 1960's: hey ladies, you can smoke and drink, too: naughty equals cool. Fielding creates a false sense of sympathy for Bridget by positioning her in embarrassing situations in front of wealthy people.  Yet Bridget moves too readily in those social circles she's meant to abhor.  Not to mention that the author handles these situations rather obviously and clumsily.  It's a transparent attempt to gain the reader as an ally and to let the author off the hook for when she slurps champagne at the novel's press release.  (Really, isn't she more sophisticated than the sophisticated?)  At least the show, Sex and the City is unapologetic about the fact that most women could not afford their lifestyle.  It may be that the author is striking an ironic pose and believes this gives her credibility: hey, look, Pride and Prejudice: a man defines a woman: what's changed in over a hundred years?  Or, wow, with our consumer culture, the character of Bridget does not so much resemble Elizabeth as she does Lydia.  (Keep in mind that if she is writing with a sense of irony then she is insulting her fans.)  The poor quality of the writing will not get her off the hook as far as any intelligent reader is concerned.  The only reason Fielding wrote this book was to make money.  Save yourself a wasted afternoon and find a more worthwhile cause to fund than the author's bar tab.
1573225517|3.0|Being a women, of course, I would really like to know if there are guys that are actually like Rob. I found this book interesting in the fact that Rob is very insecure (being an insecure women I can relate, or should I say women in general). Rob is lost. He can only describe himself by using his ideal &quot;Top 5&quot; pop music lists. Even though Nick Hornby has created Rob as an insecure individual he can teach the reader a lesson.  Rob explains a lot about the adult lifestyle.  He explains about relationships and the mind of the male species. I especially enjoyed the symbolism Hornby creates with Rob being so attached to his pop music that it is the only thing he can relate to, at first anyhow.  I would suggest this book to anyone who wants to figure out themselves.  I would even suggest it to those girlfriends who may want to figure out their boyfriends and their pop music.
0525946284|4.0|There seems to be a common thread amongst writers: WWII and love affairs.  This is a quick, exciting read.  Set in WWII France and England, this is a yet untold story of the roles that women played as intelligence officers during the war.  A fast paced book mixed with stories of torture, love, war policy, and bravado.  <BR>The author moves you from place to place seemlessly and focusing on only a handful of characters, sets the story before you, as seen through the eyes of each: the British female spy, the German officer in chanrge of breaking the resistance, and the American in charge of the operation to break German communication on the eve of D-Day.  <BR>Enjoyed it and recommend it to all!
B000002UA7|3.0|As a collection of her singles up to 1986, &quot;The Whole Story&quot; is a useful compilation.<BR>However, as Bush, with her profoundly mystical rather than rational nature, cannot be expected to rely on consistency to be memorable, rather, her career has stood on a number of songs that practically no artist can rival. Though she was writing songs at the age of twelve, her early work is badly affected by under-production which does not allow her to realise the full strength of her voice. However, &quot;Babooshka&quot;, with its catchy chorus, was an excellent pop song (her best prior to &quot;Rubberband Girl&quot;), and &quot;Wuthering Heights&quot; is an improved song with the much more mature vocal on this album (I must confess that the old vocal sounds childish).<BR>Even when she overcomes the problem of under-production, we still see that key tracks like &quot;The Big Sky&quot;, &quot;There Goes A Tenner&quot; and &quot;Night of the Swallow&quot; are omitted. All these are outstanding songs by any standards, and Bush at her best produced quite incredibly brilliant music. (I must confess the serious flaw in including &quot;The Dreaming&quot;, a failed experiment, instead of the brilliant, mysterious &quot;Night of the Swallow&quot;).<BR>Although the album does include &quot;Cloudbusting&quot;, &quot;Running Up That Hill&quot; and the anthemic &quot;Sat In Your Lap&quot;, this is not enough to make it so essential a purchase as her three most recent albums, unless your interest is confined to past hit singles. {Unlike in the UK, where she was hugely popular, in Australia Bush only a small number of major hit singles}.<BR>Even as a hits collection, it does omit a couple of hit singles (&quot;Hammer Horror&quot;, &quot;December Will Be Magic Again&quot;-which was never released in Australia). Although &quot;Experiment IV&quot; is a worthy song for her, it is not up to the standard of &quot;The Big Sky&quot; or &quot;Night of the Swallow&quot;, which are glaring omissions
B00005QB9A|5.0|I thought this moveie was one of the best I have ever seen. The story line was very fresh, the acting was great, and the photography was excellent. I think the &quot;dancing piano&quot; scene is amoung the best and most unforgettable movie scenes ever filmed.
0385484518|5.0|This was an awesome book. A real story about life. I truly believe every human being can relate to this book in some way or another. I loved this book because it carried emotion. It made me cry, laugh, and I related to experiences in it. I titled this review, &quot;Good for College Students and Professors&quot; because it could be a good guideline for those types of individuals to interact with each other. This book made me want to strive for a good relationship with my college professors. I hope I am able to do that just like Mitch Albom did with his college professor, Morrie Schwartz. Not only does this book show good relationships, it also explains life's lessons and the important things in life. Along with the important things in life Morrie explains to Mitch the specific objects and emotions that should not be taken for granted. I would suggest this book to anyone who is having a hard time dealing with life and the obstacles it hands to everyone.
B00004TJKI|3.0|This is a great courtroom drama, possibly one the finest.  But the DVD, as a 1.33:1 ratio transfer, is a travesty and insult to Preminger's fine direction and mise en scene.  If you need to see the film, please see it on DVD as the transfer is okay, definitely better than VHS, but could be better.<br />WHen the widescreen (1.85:1) comes out, get that instead.  I, for one, thought I'd picked up the original aspect ratio and was quite excited.  Now i'm a little upset that the studios are releasing so called &quot;classic films&quot; without treating them with any of the care that classics, like this film and others, so truly deserve.  SHAME ON YOU COLUMBIA!
B000025TI2|5.0|This paves the way for the absolute masterpiece of \\"From Langley Park To Memphis\\" with a most impressive set of songs. From the rocking opener \\"Faron Young\\" onwards, there are very few flaws in the songwriting and producing. Whilst McAloon does not develop the mysterious sense of knowledge of American culture he shows on \\"From Langley Park to Memphis\\", he still writes wonderful songs with a loose and delicate nature compred to \\"From Langley Park to Memphis\\".<BR>One theme that the album is notable for (and which no doubt puts many off) is the study of sexual lust and infidelity on the catchy \\"Appetite\\", \\"When Love Breaks Down\\" and \\"Horsing Around\\". However, McAloon DOES write with considerable understanding of the pain lust and infedelity can give (\\"When love breaks down you join the wrecks/Who leave their hearts for easy sex\\") {This does foresee \\"The Venus of The Soup Kitchen\\" and its tale of a witches' spell}.<BR>Apart from the songs mentioned above, McAloon focuses his lyrics on failed romances, as on \\"Bonny\\" and \\"Goodbye Lucille #1 (Johnny Johnny)\\". His effort to rage (which he simply does not know how to do) on that last song is in fact the only discernable flaw on a brilliant record. However, on \\"Desire As\\" McAloon puts in his best-ever vocal performace which suits the leisurely tone perfectly. \\"Faron Young\\" and \\"When The Angels\\" prefigure the geius he displayed on \\"From Langley Park to Memphis.\\"<BR>The major difference between this album and \\"From Langley Park to Memphis\\" is that \\"Steve McQueen\\" is much looser and more relaxed, concentrating mostly on fairly sparse ballads like \\"Desire As\\". Even the less slow tunes are very delicate and much more difficult to appreciate than \\"From Langley Park to Memphis\\", as with \\"Bonny\\", \\"Hallelujah\\" and \\"Appetite.\\"<BR>On the whole, a masterpiece from a man who has proved himself the most brilliant songwriter of the modern era.
B00005QG9J|5.0|This is a great cd. I don't know why anyone wouldn't like it? I mean it's not amazing or anything wonderful by a strech, but it makes you feel good. Just listening to this album puts me in a good mood. Sure it's not as hard as S.I.E.N.C.E or make yourself for that matter, but it is a good all around cd to anyones collection. This is a good cd, GO BUY IT!
B00004XQ83|4.0|As one loney voice inhabiting the endless pop culture consumer wasteland, I too came upon this soundtrack via the Cohen Brother's hit movie and the seductive product placements at borders books.  Deprived of free will or a personal opinion, I'll have to agree with opinions of my musical betters and exclaim that this CD provides a thin slice of Americana bluegrass.  I particularly like &quot;I Am Weary&quot; (track12) and &quot;Down to the River to Pray&quot; (track4) and am eagerly waiting for the JA-Rule remix featuring Britney Spears, P-ditty, or Kid Rock.<br />As Ulysses Everett McGill once said, &quot;Pete, the personal rancor reflected in that remark I don't intend to dignify with comment. However, I would like to address your general attitude of negativity. Consider the lilies o' the goddamn field or... hell! Take Delmar here as your paradigm of hope.&quot;  Anyone seen my Prozac PEZ dispenser?
B00005JKDR|5.0|Monsters inc is great, funny and better than shrek and both toy storys.<BR>This is a really good film and I think that Mike is the best monster, he is the funniest and Billy Crystal as his voice makes him the best character around on  a par with donkey from skrek, this is fun for the family, I recomend this to any one with a DVD player because you will be really impressed.
B00005614M|5.0|I must start by saying that it is impossible to dare not to rate this with five stars.To give a small instance of the impact of this work, as a brazilian, I recognize in this album the strong influence that it had over brazilian music. I am also certain that Miles extended his influence all over the world. So if you are an american, be proud of it, and tell all the world: &quot;America is the birthplace of The Cool&quot;.
0671024256|5.0|\\"Write with the door closed, rewrite with the door open.\\" Stephen King cuts through the B.S. and gives it to us straight. Such a welcome relief from so many other \\"writing advice\\" books that seem to be written with the book's author in mind, rather than with us, the reader/writer.<br />From such simple advice as \\"You can't write when you're dead\\" to \\"writing is at its best - always, always, always, - when it is a kind of inspired play for the writer.\\"<br />I had high expectations before I read this book and I wasn't disappointed. S.King delivered at so many levels from his personal need to write, to his issues with drug/alcohol abuse, to his recovery from a devastating accident. The common thread through it all was his ability to write.<br />Please, before you waste your money on other writing books, pick up this one and give it a chance. You may not even want another book after reading Stephen King's On Writing.
B0000636UN|5.0|The reviews have been mixed, but I think this is Sheryl Crow's best record.<br />With The Globe Sessions, Crow showed that she is one of only a handful of classic pop songwriters remaining.  And she's just gotten better as time went on.<br />C'mon, C'mon is where Crow melds the fun-but-dumb elements of her earlier songs like &quot;Everyday Is a Winding Road&quot; and &quot;All I Wanna Do&quot; with the more mature, less flashy arrangements and structures of the Globe Sessions songs.  The results are pop gems tailor-made for car radio:  &quot;Soak Up the Sun&quot; may sound like a Jimmy Buffett title, but the groovy, tastefully understated weave of instruments will hook you.  &quot;Steve McQueen&quot; is a smarter song than it sounds, without the usual annoying &quot;wink, nudge&quot; that plagues &quot;celebrity-inspired&quot; songs.  And &quot;Safe and Sound&quot; is easily Crow's best ballad ever, elegant in its simplicity, beautifully simple and dramatic.  Crow never had a huge versatile voice, but she uses it like a seasoned pro, with spot-on background vocal work and confident delivery.<br />This is what Heather Nova's cerebrally deficient South album should have been:  Sunny, sensual pop music with a mischievous glint in its eye.
B00005YXZH|5.0|Once every couple of years, an album comes along that almost-automatically merits consideration as a &quot;Classic&quot; in its genre... I offer you Radiohead's &quot;OK Computer&quot;, Lauryn Hill's &quot;Miseducation of...&quot;, and (on the ever-growing World stage) Natacha Atlas' Transglobal Underground-fueled &quot;Ayeshteni&quot; as evidence for this trend. 2002's &quot;Yankee Hotel Foxtrot&quot;, by Wilco, is the latest album to merit inclusion in the &quot;instant landmark&quot; category. Jeff Tweedy's band has made a record so jaw-droppingly complete, eclectic and satisfying that it would make both Harry Smith and Brian Eno proud. Though often described as a &quot;Hillbilly OK Computer&quot;, YHF goes farther, muuuuch farther beyond mere pigeonhole-ization. This is a record of a uniquely sobered sensibility... the studious innocence of Uncle Tupelo's early recordings and &quot;Being There's&quot; sense of wide-eyed optimism are both gone. In their stead, we find a narrator than can, alternately, drink you under the table (&quot;I Am Trying to Break Your Heart&quot;), celebrate Rock 'N Roll without sounding trite (&quot;Heavy Metal Drummer&quot;), and be patriotic without being obtuse or jingoistic (&quot;Ashes of American Flags&quot;). One has to feel somewhat sorry for Jay Farrar... on the same year he releases a sensational solo effort (&quot;Sebastopol&quot;), and in which Uncle Tupelo's greatest-hits compilation comes out, Tweedy outdoes him, again, though this time more severely than ever before.<br />As for several pundits' charge that this record tries hard to be pretentious and &quot;artsy&quot;, I will, actually, heartily agree with whoever states that claim... Nevertheless, I strain to remember any album consistently placed in most critics' &quot;Best of All Time&quot; shortlist, which did not initially strive to be &quot;important&quot;: &quot;Sgt. Pepper's&quot;, &quot;Pet Sounds&quot;, &quot;Highway 61&quot;, &quot;Born to Run&quot;, &quot;Nevermind&quot;, etc. ALL were clearly about their respective creators' attempts at critical respectability and, ultimately, historical weight. Tweedy can hardly be faulted for doing the same, particularly in an era of such fluffy, unimportant sonic trifle, courtesy of a conference room-ful of three-piece Swedish suits who write music for thirty-plus men posing as &quot;boy&quot; bands, and for bleached blondes with no vocal talent other than aping faux-R &amp; B mellismas.<br />Wouldn't you just HATE to be that poor sap from Wilco's former record company who told Tweedy and co. to take a walk... with this master-piece in tow?!?!?!
B000002I55|5.0|A poet in my country said (free english version, please!) that &quot;one day the mass will eat the fine biscuit I make...&quot;. This may be the case. I am not an intellectual, and I don't know what it means to say that a music is &quot;tonal&quot; or &quot;atonal&quot;, but I'm fascinated by this work. Set yourself free to listen to it.
B00000I8UJ|5.0|Dextor Gordon and company really have it together on this album.  Sonny Clark lays some nice notes on the keys.  Butch Warren and Billy Higgins form a rock solid bass and drum foundation.  This album definately has a great \\"feel\\" to it.  Dextor Gordon's sax just flows with wonderful ease.  These musicians had it together on this date and it shows.  Go is a classic 60's blue note album.  It's a good one for one starting a collection.  By the way, the Rudy Van Gelder edition sounds simply spectacular!  Remember, this was recorded back in '62.  So go out and get this album!  At [the price], you can't go wrong!
B00005NWM3|5.0|At last - a proper rock CD with intellegent lyrics that really rocks! I bought SILVER SIDE UP after hearing HOW YOU REMING ME played constantly on local radio - a thing that startled me at first as their playlist is usually made up of boy bands, dodgy ballads and dance music. Often the album does not live up to the single, but that's not the case with this one. After years of despairing that I'd ever find any new, decent rock music, SILVER SIDE UP is a truly great CD. The people of Dover don't know what's hit them as I never stop playing it!
B000059MEK|2.0|I'm not a big dance music fan, so maybe others won't mind. But I guess this CD is made for dancing, not for listening to, because boy does each song go on for way too long.
0385335482|5.0|This book is amazing. It gives you some disconfort on the shop-addition thing. But is a fun and broad mind book to read. It takes you on a journey throught the amzing mind of a girl with a very low self esteem but a big imagination. And in the end she takes the prince!!
B000002UJQ|2.0|If it would have come out 30 years ago.  Still, despite the fact that lots of increasingly arrogant people who oh so can't stand anyone who doesn't think Radiohead is the &quot;Next Big Thing&quot; this album is pretty good.  Why two stars?  People- be subjective.  Just because YOU like the album, doesn't mean it garners a five star review.  Radioheads reviewers are a real petty lot, anyone who thinks someone's stupid for not liking something should keep their OPINIONS to themselves.  Sometimes I wonder if it's because they really think this bands that original, or that they're  afraid this bands all hype.  Are you being taken?  <br />Not all hype, but enough to taint what could have been a great underground reputation.  More concise than the bends, better song writing, and FAR more musical.  Unfortunatly this album doesn't reveal anything new on multiple listens, and sounds really overproduced.  Still better than anything else they've done.  The Bends is good but overated, Kid A a directionless stupor.  I've heard Amnesiac is better but I've never got a chance to listen to it yet.  Neither do I care, these guys just don't have it like other bands.  But I guess I don't have &quot;true musical taste&quot;, or &quot;An appreciation for complex music&quot; because I don't think these guys are that great.  Only the all intelligent Radiohead worshipers know anything, so if you're becoming enraged right now go read the other reviews to find the acceptance you so desperately require.  Just don't be surprised when one day someone plays an album for you and you say &quot;Is this the new Radiohead album?&quot;  And he laughs in your face and tells you it's from the 70's and you realize that Radiohead wasn't so innovative after all.  <br />But again, what do I know, I'm stupid
B0000636UN|3.0|Maybe it's because I was looking forward to this album for such a long time, but I couldn't help but be a little disappointed.  There is just something missing from this album.  It's not that anything is bad, but nothing really jumps out at me.  There were no songs, as on her previous albums, that I wanted to listen to over and over again right away.  Don't get me wrong, I think C'mon C'mon is a good album, it's the first album by a current artist I've bought in a very long time.  I really love Sheryl Crow's music generally.  I guess after I heard interviews of her saying how much she was into bands like the Allman Brothers, and that southern blues rock sound, that her album would reflect those influences more.  I was pretty hopeful hearing the first track.  I think Steve McQeen is a really good song, and the next two, Soak Up The Sun and You're An Original are pretty good too, but the album as a whole doesn't keep the energy going.  Safe and Sound is a good balld, but songs like It's so Easy and It's Only Love don't really do anything for me.  Also, I wish her duets had been more prominent.  I would have liked to hear Liz Phair a little more on Soak Up the Sun.  On Sheryl Crow's previous albums I always found many of the song lyrics to be intersting, and I sometimes wondered what she was getting at.  On this album she really doesn't seem to have as much to say, but again it's not bad, it's just that it doesn't particularly stand out.  Over all I have to say C'mon C'mon is a good album but not great.
B0000636UN|5.0|All I need is a warm summer day and a convertable. This CD is like a road trip with its classic 70's rock combined with country rock. The first track, &quot;Steve McQueen&quot; is a great rock song with an infectous hook. &quot;Sook up the Sun&quot; will go down as one of summer's best anthems. &quot;C'mon, C'mon&quot; with Stevie Nicks...enough said. Other great tracks include &quot;You're an Original&quot;, &quot;Lucky Kid&quot; and &quot;Hole in My Pocket&quot;. As the sun sets on our road trip, Sheryl gives us &quot;Weather Channel&quot; with Emmylou Harris. What a great way to end the disc. Thank you Sheryl for the great road trip!
0446677450|4.0|Excellent plan, but let's hope your children can ignore some of the off the wall suggestions such as skipping college.
B00004XONN|1.0|That this album is actually everything people say it is, isn't a lame ripoff of the German acid rock scene,  And isn't a depressing unneccesary \\"revelation\\" of sad facts of life.  And After that moment passes, come back to reality and remember just because a bands better than what else is out at the time, it doesn't make them good.
B0000634EV|5.0|The dynamics and pure musical power of this album are kickin' through the whole disc. Yes, it is a little less 'metal' than Nola ( their 1st record-which also is blazin from begining to end) but the songs acount for Phil's ( Throatman for Pantera) more troubled times: heroin addiction-constant depression-and though it all the power to confide in friends and his wife Opel to help him press through... which in the end created this awesome album...
0441172717|5.0|If you love politics, intrigue, and a marvelous world that just leaves you wanting more and more, DUNE is it.  I have yet to meet a fellow Political Science major who didn't find these books inspired.  If you don't like Dune . . . then you can check out the Dick and Jane books in the children's section.
0671024256|4.0|Starting this book, I didn't really know what to expect. Having only read a few books by Stephen King, I was -and to a certain extend still am- unfamiliar with his style, his tempo... <br />Finding out about someone's life to me is like reading a stranger's diary... A bit awkward at first, interesting and enchanting in the process... He makes you admire the mother's stamina and pride, sympathize with the family's misfortunes, anticipate till that very first strike of luck with the all-known happy ending... Finally going through the incident that almost cost him his life and the reading society an important source of quality...<br />Multi-level as it is, the book is more than worth having a look; we don't need S.K. to tell us that you need talent, or that you have to work hard to achieve something... But coming from a great achiever, it simply confirms that inside each and every one of us, there's a small God hiding... I read somewhere that you can't teach someone to sing, or play the guitar, or swing a golf club... you just help them bring what they have inside them to the surface... S.K. is doing that in the most sufficient and successful way possible.<br />All of us believe (and so we should) that we've come to this world with a talent. That could be music, maths or literature... I still haven't found mine; but if it's writing, now I know how to do it. Hopefully I will.
0440211727|5.0|Great book - beautifully paced, genuinely moving at times, and unlike some of his other works, completely unpretentious and totally satisfying. In my opinion - his best.
B00005J73X|5.0|If you are like me, you have most of these songs already in your Bon Jovi collection, but it is fun to have them all on one CD and the live aspect is cool.  Please note though - I love Bon Jovi so even having a CD that is mostly repeats is great by me :)
B00000J6AG|5.0|Moby's \\"Play\\" is an hour of raw,honest emotion.This 1999 album may have been a big pop hit due the fact that Moby liscened all the songs to commericals and films,excessive media coverage,and of course,his duet with Gwen Stefani,\\"South Side\\" BUT over all that is a very spritual and emotional album that you wouldn't except from such a frumpy looking guy(lol).<br />Many of the tracks use samples from archival blues and gospel records under  hypnotic dance tracks suppiled by Moby himself<BR>and it just plain moves you! This is the type of album that you can just play and sit down and listen to beginning and end and you'll feel like you've went on a journey of some sort.Really.<BR>\\"Honey\\",the soaring \\"Why Does My Heart Feel So Bad\\"(one of the most beautiful songs I've heard in recent memory),\\"Porcelian\\",<BR>\\"Machete\\",the ubiqtious \\"Bodyrock\\"...you name it,every emotion is displaced in the songs.<br />I've never heard a mainstream(well,the mainstream came to it) album with such crystal clear emotion.<br />Wheter you want to grieve over something or clean your house,<BR>Moby's \\"Play\\" is the album for you.Let me just close by saying that there's a song on here for every ocassion.<br />....And how can I forget about \\"Natrual Blues\\".Oh,man...That song is so beautiful! The video with Christina Ricci(directed by zany photographer David LaChapelle) is so touching and Moby's sweeping performance of the song along with Jill Scott and avant garde performance act Blue Man Group was equally moving...Oh,sorry for adding all that but I just had to include that.
0440213525|4.0|Let's face it - John Grisham's not going to win the Nobel Prize any time soon. But he is still the King of the easy read - call it trash if you want to, but you won't find too many books easier to read than this one. The story is great, the plotting is great, the ending is - IMHO, of course - a little disappointing as (in my opinion (which goes without saying)) in many of his books, but it's a great story, and Grisham tells it like no one else can. Read this one - great book.
B0000029LG|5.0|This CD is great if you don't own all Michael CD's. The first disc gives you 15 of classics like &quot;Billie Jean&quot;, &quot;Thriller&quot;, and &quot;Man in the Mirror&quot;. The second disc then has other groundbreaking songs like &quot;Scream&quot; with his sister Janet and chart topper &quot;You Are Not Alone&quot;. I have it and still play it.
B000000OPW|5.0|Like many, my favourite release from the Banshees is probably &quot;Juju.&quot;  But &quot;Tinderbox&quot; is my runner-up.  With some of the most catchy yet unquestionably dark material the band has ever released, I never grow tired of listening to this album.<br />&quot;Candyman&quot; kicks things off, very fast and peppy.  A lot of my friends sort of dismiss this one, and it is admittedly 'sickly sweet' to an extent, but I always loved the instrumental breakdown toward the middle of the song.  &quot;The Sweetest Chill&quot; is one of the most beautiful and melodic songs the Banshees have ever done.  It has a very melancholic, yet uplifting vibe to it.  It is here that you will really begin to take note of the richly expressive guitar work on the album, as well as Siouxsie Sioux's heartfelt and powerful voice.  &quot;This Unrest&quot; is a manic, Gothic masterpiece - a slinky, dark rhythm gives the song an added sense of the exotic and then climaxes to a chaotic, frantic chorus.  This album probably illustrates some of Budgee's most fantastic drumming with the Banshees, and it is heard on this track, the claustrophobia of &quot;92 Degrees&quot; and the foreboding, epic &quot;Land's End&quot; that appears later in the disc.<br />Of course, the overplayed and overrated college radio hit &quot;Cities In Dust&quot; appears on this release.  As a Gothic DJ, I am just worn out on this song.  In some ways I suppose I take it for granted that so many people like it.  So its presence on this disc is surely noteworthy.  I just always skip over it for the more progressive and atmospheric numbers.<br />Overall, I recommend this disc wholeheartedly.  Initially, pick up the two singles collections to see if the Banshees are for you.  If you like what you hear, then start buying the rest of the albums and seek this one out right away.  Some of the Banshees greatest songs are non-single tracks and at least 4 of them are on this release.
B00005QENZ|4.0|In 1989 Aerosmith released another masterpiece, &quot;Pump&quot;. Now they went back into the studio and recorded &quot;Get A Grip&quot; in 1993. Steven Tyler and Joe Perry did it again. Songs like &quot;Eat the Rich&quot;, &quot;Fever&quot;, &quot;Livin' On the Edge&quot;, and the famous ballad &quot;Amazin'&quot; made the album a blast. Plus Joe Perry on lead vocals on &quot;Walk On Down&quot;. Buy this album.
0385503954|5.0|I read &quot;Atonement&quot; knowing nothing about it other than my wife said it made her cry, and that the book had had good reviews.  I am not an Eng Lit type, but I think a novel needs four things to succeed: character, plot, construction and style.  McEwan spends the first half of the book developing the characters to such an extent that I felt I knew them all, and knew them quite well. The plot unfolded, but I had no idea where it was going.  I knew where I wanted it to go, but there were surprises. The  construction of the novel was impressive. It was seamless and very clever, but never appeared clever.  McEwan is a master of &quot;The art that conceals the art.&quot;  And this is shown also in his beautiful prose - well worthy of being read aloud. <br />Now I have to re-read &quot;Amsterdam&quot; - just skimmed it the first time.

0385501560|3.0|Choke tells the story of a guy who is fixated on sex, and his mother.  Luckily, this turns out not to be as gross as it sounds.<br />The main character is a recovering sexaholic who works at one of those colonial-era recreations where the workers pretend like they're still living in the 18th century.  He is trying to make enough money to get his mother a feeding tube.  Needless to say, hilarious hijinks ensue.<br />This book is pretty funny, but doesn't have the deeper meaning that Fight Club had.  Its an entertaining read from a very talented author.  If you're going to give Palahniuk a try, read Fight Club first.  If you like that, then try this one out.
0064407667|2.0|For all you other reviewers raving about how great this book is, did we read the same book? I am 14 and my sister is 8 and we both tried to get through this book. I did after forcing myself to since I had bought it. I didn't really like it at all. The story is passable, but the ending is stupid. I don't want to say too much about it for fear of giving it away in case you actually want to read this book, but its a pretty bad ending. Its the kind of ending somebody would write when they are totally out of ideas. I do not recommend this book, but other people obviously liked it. So instead of buying it, I suggest finding it at a library.
0062511408|5.0|Este libro, es simplemente uno de los mejores que he leido en mi vida. Y se lo recomiendo a todos. Este libro marco mi vida en tantos sentidos, y fue el que abrio el paso a la lectura de otros libros de este gran autor Paulo Coelho, como A orrillas Del Rio Piedra me sente y Llore y Veronika Decide Morir, Las Valkirias y todos los demas que el ha escrito. Recomiendo leer este libro antes que cualquien otro de Paulo Coelho, es un muy buen comienzo para entender los demas, inclusive El peregrino de Compostela que fuel el primero escrito por este autor. Con el alquimista aprendi a so&ntilde;ar, y mas importante aun aprendi a crecer... a creer en mi misma, a trasarme metas no solo laborales si no espirituales.... creci mucho espiritualmente, y como diria la esposa de el mismo en el libro Las Valkirias, mi espiritu se expandio... aprendi a ver mas alla del horizonte. Aprende tu tambien con este libro! pero que no sea el unico! Aprende a conoserte mejor a ti mismo y a cumplir tus metas. Y has los ejercicios que es muy, muy importante. Con mucho gusto compartire mis opiniones y mis triunfos acerca de este y  otros libros. Maktub!
B00005JKL8|3.0|This film  could have been an excellent film, if it would had relied on more \\"acting\\" and factual realism for the main character. Although it was filmed in Slovakia and NOT in the Balkans, it does convey the barbarism of the Balkan war. The DVD contains deleted explicit scenes, which should had been left in the film and not cut, and tacked on in the extras section, because the additional footage, shows  more realism of the evil situation and the atrocities done by the Serbs. The biggest drawback is the believability factor of the main character: his clean shaven look,  and the lack of portrayal  of someone who is truly trying to survive against all odds. The special affects are very good and the use of actual Soviet equipment (borrowed from the Slovak army I suppose) of the type supplied to the Serbian army gives the film  additional credibility to the location, but they do not compensate enough, as the utilization of the  main character undermines the film.  The ending is somewhat comical and very unrealistic, and that also impairs the film, which is too bad as the US Navy cooperated in the making of this film. Over all it is nothing more than a modern day  \\"patriotic\\"  fiction, when it could have been a very realistic portrayal of similar events with real merit.
0425107469|5.0|This book is REALLY good... no its unbelievably good! So many stories in this one book, all tying together and revolving around the most unique character (in my opinion) you will ever find, Einstien (the dog). I would recommend this book to those who dont read on a regular basis, or just havent read dean koontz... it will win you over and crave for more! I truly became excited, worried and, yes, on several occasions almost came to tears! READ IT!!! I never knew a book could be THIS good, and if you watched the crummy movie, forgot about that [movie], read the book.

B00005RY7X|5.0|...I heard the latest John Hiatt album, and the first cut floored me. It was the best rock and roll I had heard in years, and I had to play it over and over. Now, nothing against John Hiatt, but if we have to depend on some 50 -something Hoosier to give us anthing worth turning up loud, the world is in a sorry state. I don't want Bono's politics or REM's angst or complex lyrical statements. I want something that demands that I turn up the volume now. All the arguments about this being too dumb and too simple are the same ones people made about the Dolls and the Ramones 30 years ago. Look who was right and who was wrong. Buy this album if you love rock and roll. If you don't, listen to Dave Matthews and go on pretending you are having fun.

Both are great albums, but there was still a sense that Roger Hodgson's shadow was still looming over the group. Then, without making any official announcements at all, the band simply stopped. A whole decade passed, but then, at last, Supertramp got back into business. Boy, did they! After a 10-year absence, 1997's &quot;Some Things Never Change&quot; is the album that *finally* allowed Supertramp to emerge from Roger's shadow. Although it certainly would've been great to have Hodgson back in the band for this album---and he WAS asked---he declined to return, and so, singer/songwriter/keyboardist Rick Davies remains firmly at the helm once more. And what an album he &amp; the band have delivered after so long---&quot;Some Things&quot; is simply spectacular! Song for song it is stunning. I was blown away right from the first listen, and I knew right then and there that even without Hodgson, Supertramp had returned in a big, BIG way. Five years later, &quot;Some Things Never Change&quot; is still my personal favorite album by the band. Like the album title suggests, the classic Supertramp hybrid of jazz, funk, pop, &amp; rock remains firmly intact even after such a long break, with veteran members John Anthony Helliwell (saxophone) &amp; Bob Sibenberg (drums) still onboard along with Davies to contribute to the hallmark Supertramp sound. The musicianship, songwriting, and overall *feel* of &quot;Some Things&quot; is truly something special. Although Supertramp have never recorded what one would call a &quot;concept album&quot; (though the epic title track to &quot;Brother Where You Bound&quot; seems to be conceptual---there was even a movie-featurette video produced for it), there really does seem to be a theme of sorts running through &quot;Some Things Never Change,&quot; which is this: in the face of hard times, keep your chin up, because you WILL get through it. The lyrics are some of the most heartfelt that Rick Davies has ever written, real uplifting words of wisdom to hear &amp; read (especially now in these harsh times we're currently living in), in such songs as the brilliant, atmospheric opener, &quot;It's A Hard World,&quot; the cheerful &quot;Get Your Act Together,&quot; the inspiring &quot;Listen To Me Please,&quot; the blues/gospel of &quot;Help Me Down That Road,&quot; and the album's ray-of-hope finale, &quot;Where There's A Will.&quot; Davies' commanding singing voice and unique fingerwork on the keys remains strong after all this time, and Hodgson's replacement, Mark Hart, sounds close enough to his predecessor, and he delivers some fine vocals himself, especially on the funky &quot;Sooner Or Later.&quot; With all due respect to the great Roger Hodgson &amp; his marvelous contributions to the band's recorded work of the past, &quot;Some Things Never Change&quot; is such a good Supertramp album, that you really don't miss him. In my opinion, Rick Davies &amp; company are carrying on without Hodgson just fine, as this album proves beyond the shadow of a doubt. &quot;Some Things Never Change&quot; is a joyous, uplifting album that always makes me smile, a phenomenal comeback for one of the world's greatest bands. :-)

6305842442|1.0|The original theater version of this sci-fi masterpiece is, without doubt, one of the best in the genre.  The director's cut is only a tribute to the (understandable) ego of Ridley Scott.  A novice viewer of the latter can only wonder about what the heck is going on.  I agree with the comments of another reviewer that the death scene of Rutger Hauer is irreparably damaged by the missing voice-over.  This drama definitely needs the aspect of humanity provided by Harrison Ford's narration; it is far too dark and brooding otherwise.  His narrating words in the ending scene, with Ford driving to safety, provide emotional closure:  no one knows how much time they have [so enjoy every moment].  I felt so strongly about all this that I went out and bought a used copy of this movie for 80 bucks on EBay.<br />The DVD medium allows viewers to watch the version of their preference.  Why not let them choose whether or not to have the voice-over?  It would clearly sell some more DVDs.<br />P.S.:  I have always wondered why I have never seen anyone comment on one (irrelevant) flaw in the script:  try matching the number of fleeing replicants accounted for in the movie (5) with the number that originally fled the off-world colony (6, according to the skin-job hater).  Yeah, yeah, one more showed up later, but she wasn't from off-world.  There's still one more replicant running around somewhere.  DECKER, COME BACK!

B00005T33W|4.0|On one level, Terry Zwigoff's newest film is a tale of teenage angst and an odd romance.  The film's main character, Enid, has a genuinely dark and skeptical view of humanity and popular culture.  Zwigoff does a marvelous job in showing how Enid stumbles into a romance with Seymour, a nerdy, 40-something record collector, and how she reacts to that relationship.  At times, I saw Enid saying and doing things for no logical reason -- very accurate for an 18-year-old.  The director excels at creating a very realistic portrayal of how a teenager thinks and acts...much better than American Pie (1 or 2)!  <br />More importantly, Ghost World is a biting satire on America's cultural ignorance, savaging popular culture left and right - sappy movies, political correctness, record collectors, cliched artwork (and art teachers), and more - you gotta look for it!  My favorite scene in the movie placed Enid and Seymour in a bar where an old blues legend was opening up for this cheesy, Blues Traveler-esque &quot;blues&quot; band that passes itself off as authentic &quot;delta blues.&quot;   The frat boys in attendance pay more attention to the sports game on the TV than the bluesman, and when the headliner takes the stage, they all break out dancing like some lounge show (leaving Seymour aghast). <br />Yeah, the romance angle was nice, but I relished the director's sharp-witted stabs at popular culture.  Pardon me for snugly smirking at ya next time in the video store, but you'll know why after you've seen this film!
B00005NWM3|3.0|Nickelback is a decent band.  They can play their instruments and write their own music. I am not crazy about all the songs,and afer hearing the cd several times, none of the songs except for a few stand out at all.  How you remind me and too bad are the two singles and are clkearly distinguishable from the others.  How u remind me is a decent song to listen to while you are trying to sleep. Too Bad is dull but has a great chorus, and never again is a good song with a great bass line, its the best one on the cd.
B00005LQ04|5.0|Dario Argento directed this movie twenty years ago, and today it still remains as his ultimate masterpiece. Regardless of genre, in my opinion this is the most beautiful movie ever made. The sound, the colors, the directing, the sets, the incredible scenes -- all lead to a truly remarkable cinematic achievement! I love this film.
B00005V3Z4|5.0|When I first saw Jake Gyllenhaal in October Sky (one of my favorites) I said, \\"That guy will be headlining the movies if he keeps going like he's going.\\" Luckily others agreed, and now we have Donnie Darko.<br />First off, Donnie Darko belongs in a category by itself like a large number of movies released in recent years. Horror? Not quite. Thriller? Nope, no Jodie Foster in sight. So, we have the new category that I have dubbed \\"Stumper\\" or \\"Figure-it-outer.\\" Other movies in this category range from \\"Magnolia\\" to \\"Pulp Fiction\\" and even \\"Unbreakable\\".<br />Donnie is disturbed. So disturbed in fact, he's stupified. (Cheap Joke). He has been seeing a psychologist due to his emotional instability. Also, he is seeing a six foot rabbit. His family life is so-so, and the bindings in his family seem to be slipping daily. Like Sixth Sense, at the end of the movie, there is a shocker, and no matter what your thinking while your watching, throw it out. Thats not going to be it. But I can tell you that you will be thinking about Donnie Darko for days after you see it. It's a great movie, and requires puzzle-piecing. I just have one question: Did the world end in 88? Oh, really?<br />While you watching Darko, keep your eyes open for clues and remember the plot points to help yourself place the conclusion when its over. Also keep your eyes and ears out for some great book and movie references. And yes, they were watching Evil Dead in the theater. Groovy baby.
B00000G3Q4|5.0|Simply a great little movie! Raimi's budget was low but he set his sights high to bring us a super flick. If you haven't already seen this movie or heard about it, you must be from another planet. All horror fans KNOW this pic. Now, for this DVD...it rocks! The behind-the-scenes extras and the beautiful  transfer makes this movie seem fresh and new again. Well worth the purchase to watch over, and over, and over, and over.....

B000002KET|5.0|It seems foolish to me to attempt some sort of &quot;quality ordering&quot; of Sabbath albums.  Each one is what it is, and for Sabbath fans that should be enough.  SBS was extraordinary in that it was a bold step in a new direction for the band, only hinted at in some of the more thickly orchestrated songs on IV.  It also paved the way for the albums which followed - it is ridiculous to think that the band could do Sabotage without having done this first.  From the dual nature of the album cover and interior artwork to the thunderous riffs juxtaposed with softer acoustic passages from the title song and &quot;Spiral Architect&quot; to the aptly titled interlude &quot;Fluff&quot; to the searching psychological lyrics of most of the tracks, this album has deep personal meaning for me, and I would not presume that it would have the same meaning for anyone else.  Is it pretentious?  Remember the musical culture of the mid 70s in which it was created.  Is it uneven?  Nary an album can be found without some imperfection that helps give it its character.  To those who would cast their disapproval on this album, you are entitled to your opinion.  But this album will certainly grow on you if you let it.  Sink your mind into the music and good things will happen.
B000063CPL|4.0|I know everyone is talking about how great the three guitar sound is, however I think it is high time for Jannick Gers to realize his services are no longer required.  I saw the Brave New World Tour in Japan last year, and saw Maiden as I have never seen them before.  Playing a 2,000 seat hall with no big-scale production, basically the band, a few lights, the amps and that was it.  The best Maiden show I have ever witnessed, with the exception of the Live after Death shows.  I have seen Iron Maiden live 33 times in all corners of the globe.  This 2cd set is a fantastic live album.  I don't completely agree with the set list, too much emphasis on the Brave New World material.  I can understand why, though.  The older material has been released in various formats on numerous live albums in the past.  One definite highlight is hearing Bruce's vocals on some Blayze Bailey era songs, however, I don't think Bruce's heart and soul is in this material as much as in his own compositions.  The complete ignoring of Adrian Smith is what has really bothered me about this reunion.  As other fans have mentioned in previous reviews, hearing Jannick Gers destroy Adrian Smith's lead guitar solos is just plain sad.  Sorry Jannick, but you are no Adrian Smith.  I am very disappointed that Adrian is not doing the lead guitar on all of the songs that he has given us over the years.  Being a huge Iron Maiden fan since 1981, I think Rock In Rio is a great live album, however it could have been a lot better without Jannick Gers.  He was simply an easy replacement when Adrian Smith left, and when Adrian returned, Jannick should have realized he has been such a small part of the whole Maiden phenomena, and should have left.  Sorry Jannick, but you ruined what should have been a great tour by being there.  Once again, buy the album, I think the production is better than anything they have done in the past in the live format, and the crowd reponse is deafening.  I also agree with former opinions that they could have done more with the presentation.  The cover is great, but the liner notes do not even come close to the Live After Death format.  This was also evident on the Brave New World cd.  It seems that they are not putting the effort in to the packaging that they did throughout their earlier career.  I would say if you are not familiar with the Brave New World material, you probably will not be too impressed with this album.  However, if you are as big a fan as I am, your Iron Maiden collection would not be complete without it.<br />UP THE IRONS!!!!!

B00005Q45W|5.0|Leonard Cohen at 60 shows no signs of revisiting the past.  His latest offering is perhaps his best musically, and one of his most haunting lyrically.  He gets his help on this trip from Sharon Robinson whose austere arrangements and gospel style punctuate the spiritual nature of the poetry.  Simple, yes, but rich in content and deeply meaningful for the Cohen faithful that have been waiting for further instruction.  If you like Leonard Cohen, this CD is like a Godiva truffel.  If you are not familiar with the man, this might be a good way to start your journey. There are few songwriters or poets that can call themselves his equal. I can't wait to take another turn on Boogie Street.

B00005JKYS|4.0|Based on the book by Lt. Col. Harold Moore and Joseph Galloway, this film is about a 1964 battle of less than 400 U.S. soldiers against more than 2,000 North Vietnamese, which set the stage for the slaughters that were to follow. There's plenty of graphic violence using the most modern cinematographic effects and we are again reminded of the horror of war and the tragic human toll it takes.<br />Mel Gibson does a fine job as man who must lead his troops into battle.  Some of the scenes on the home front though are a bit too maudlin for my taste, as he plays a religious father of five, who must do his duty by protecting his loved ones at home. The army wives are just a little too sweet and brainless although a later scene in which Madeline Stowe, cast as Moore's wife, does show her to be a fine actress.  There is too much talk in the early scenes, too much of a sugar coated version of \\"life in the 60s\\".<br />But then the men go to Vietnam, and this is where the real story begins.  It is a story of heroism in spite of unbelievable odds.  It is the story of death and pain and wounds so graphic that I wanted to cover my eyes.  It is the story of the very beginnings of a war that later turned into a muddled mess.  The film made a small attempt to show some of the humanity of a North Vietnamese soldier but I suspect however that this was inserted merely for political correctness.  This story is indeed an American story that managed somehow to hate the war and yet honor the men who fought in it.<br />The action was intense, and with the exception of some of the early scenes, the story moved along well.  Mel Gibson and his supporting cast of actors did their jobs well.  I was moved and upset once again by the futility of war and thankful for the comfortable life I take so for granted.  We've all seen films like this before though and know the outcome.  It's not for everyone but I recommend it for war film buffs.  I enjoyed it.
B0000636UN|5.0|The best yet from one of today's most important artists.  It may take a few listens to trully get a feel for what she has created, but once the melodies begin to sink in, and then the vocals begin to be understood, you are a left with a catchy, poignant albumn far surpassing her former best (The Globe Sessions).  My problem now is that once I finally decide which my favorite song on the albumn is, I have to already change my mind by the next time I give her a listen.
6304039506|5.0|This 1951 award-winning film was directed by Elia Kazan and based on a play by Tennessee Williams.  Set in New Orleans shortly after WWII, it starred Marlon Brando, then just 27 years old, in the performance that set his career in motion.  Cast as Stanley Kowalski, the rough loudmouthed husband of Stella, played by Kim Hunter, he struts around in a torn tee shirt, his body all muscle and sweat, and there's a raw animal magnetism to his performance.  When Stella's sister, the tragic fading beauty Blanche Dubois, played by Vivian Leigh, suddenly comes to live with them, the tension mounts.<br />Filmed in black and white, most of the action takes place in a cramped two-room apartment, and in the street directly outside.  The dialogue leads the viewer to understand the characters on an ever-deepening level, and the facial expressions and physical actions heightened the emotional realism. Brando smashed dishes and threw a radio out a window and often acted like a caged animal.  The screen sizzled with raw passion during the romantic scenes between him and Hunter, where he reveals just enough tenderness to give him added appeal.  I understand that a few minutes of footage in the scenes between them were added to the video, which had previously been censored out, and I could see the difference this made. All the casting was excellent, and Karl Malden, in a supporting role as Brando's buddy who courts Blanche was great.  I couldn't help thinking about Vivian Leigh in &quot;Gone With The Wind&quot;, which had been made a dozen years before, and felt the role of Blanche was just perfect for her. In &quot;Streetcar&quot; she's actually 38 years old with lines beginning around her eyes and slightly loosened skin.<br />Even though some of the dialog was a bit mumbled, and some of the scenes just a little more talky than they would be today, I loved the fact that the action came from the internal conflicts and acting abilities of the characters, and didn't need any modern special effects to add to the realism.  &quot;Streetcar&quot; is a small work of art and has certainly stood the test of time.  Highly recommended.al effects to add to the realism.  &quot;Streetcar&quot; is a small work of art and has certainly stood the test of time.  Highly recommended.

0446604844|5.0|I am recommending this book to all my friends who love a real heart-pounding thriller.  I refused to put this book down until I finished it...Total Control has all the verve and excitement of Absolute Power but is infinitely more intriguing. The high-tech aspect of this novel was well researched. I love Baldaccis treatment of his women characters: in Sidney Archer he has created a smart, determined and savvy tigress who exhibits extraordinary resolve and courage in her quest to find out about her husbands surprising death. She is as adept at dealing with hired hit men as she is with slick corporate lawyers. The plot itself is a rather convoluted maze with enough twists and turns to keep the reader guessing about the next plot line: chapter by chapter. This is pure David Baldacci. There is no filler here. If you want to read an exciting novel that holds your interest with each page this is it.

B00005QDW1|4.0|It took over five years for No Doubt to follow-up their breakthrough album Tragic Kingdom, and when they did, we were left with a mature Gwen Stefani moaning about her life in the extremely disappointing Return of Saturn. Fast-forward a few months, and the band announces that they're planning on releasing yet another album, this time focusing on a hip-hop/dance sensibilities in their tunes - you can pretty much guess how much we were dreading it: hip-hop from a ska/punk group? And from a band that hasn't released even one worthy track in almost six years?  But that's not to say we weren't hoping - Stefani's excellent duet with Eve on \\"Let Me Blow Ya, Mind?\\", as well as her appearance on Moby's remix of \\"South Side\\" kept us praying for something good, and we've been blessed with Rock Steady. OK, so maybe it's not exactly a godsend, but it's still pretty damn good. Opening with a 30-second gospel-like praise for Rock Steady, it slides in to the first track \\"Hella Good\\", combining Stefani's sexy voice with `80s electronica and `90s guitar's to create a sublimely eccentric opening song that sounds remarkably akin to Madonna's \\"Music\\". It's followed by the hit-single \\"Hey Baby\\", which lyrically pairs the song with Tragic Kingdom's \\"Just A Girl\\", describing the lead-singer's alienation from being in a band full of guys. The video for the tune is also included on the album, which does nothing more than to try and show off the flat (chest-wise, we mean) Stefani's body at every opportunity - not that we have any objections, of course. But what differs this recording from the group's others is that, essentially, it was produced by a talented group of individuals, including Prince, Nellee Hooper, Sly & Robbie, Ric Ocasek, Steely & Cleve and Mark Stent. It is, however, Prince's (we can't be bothered with that Artist-Formerly-Known-As bull) contribution in \\"Waiting Room\\" that stands out the most, with the `Artist' actually writing and singing most of the tune. Overall, No Doubthave proven that they're a band that can redefine themselves to fit any musical situation, with their immense recording Rock Steady having more hooks in it than you'd find in a meat freezer.
B000001ESP|5.0|My review is intended for anybody who is interested in but not familiar with the music of Rush. Reviewers will go on and on about this and that, but the bottom line is this is the FIRST Rush album anybody should buy. This band has changed SO much in the last (gulp) 25 years. This change has been a very succinct evolution such that any one recording sounds like the next album and previous album blended together. This release represents a benchmark in Rush's career. It is the second to last studio release with their long-time friend and producer Terry Brown at the controls. To me this album marks the last time that the song-structure was built almost exclusively on a foundation of guitar, drums, and bass. Synthesizers and deeply layered guitar effects were used sparingly, but not depended on as heavily as on subsequent recordings. While it's true that this is the pinnacle of Rush's commercial success, I think it may be precisely why they steered in a different direction after this...they are no sell-outs!! In my opinion, every song on the recording is a 5-star song except Limelight and Vital Signs which are 4-star songs. For the quality of the songs and the style of the production, this is where everyone should begin their exploration of Rush, and then move forward or back in time as they see fit.
B00005A46T|2.0|You wouldn't expect the new Slipknot CD to be any good, but it actually turns out to be one of the most hilarious recordings we've ever heard. Starting off with a 30 second sound clip of people moaning and crying, which kicks into track 2's tremendously loud \\"People = ...\\" - a title that's so death-metal inspired you can't help but laugh. The lyrics, however, (if you can hear them) really will make you roll on the floor: \\"Here we go again .../Come on down and see the idiot right here/Too ... to beg and not afraid to care\\" - right, we know what they're on about. And it doesn't end there either (although some might wish it did), \\"I am hated\\" is even better, combining sadistic lyrics with futile guitar solos - actually, that pretty much sums up every song on this CD. What we did find awfully amusing though was the `Parental Advisory Explicit Content' label on the cover, which made us wonder who else but 12 year olds, who think it's great to hear past-it rockers swearing every other word, would buy this album, unless it was someone who wanted a good laugh for ten minutes? In the end, the new Slipknot CD isn't a total disappointment, it's good to listen to once for a chuckle, then there's hundreds of things to use it as: a drinks coaster, a Frisbee, something to twirl around when your bored - be creative!

0393312836|5.0|There are tired, predictable books, and then there is A Clockwork Orange.  In what should have been a sickening foray into the dark underbelly of the surreal crime world, Burgess leads his readers to find the essentiality of choice and the importance of living life for the good and bad.  Although many graphic images can have a stomach-turning effect on the reader, the overall motive of the book remains intact through the clever use of language and subtle humor.  What is unique to this book is the way in which the reader may choose how he would like it to end by simply ignoring the addendum of the last chapter or reading on.  Depending on this choice, the book can mean very different things, and that is a feature not found in many other works.  There are books that are worth reading for their social commentary, others for their wit, and still others for their surrealism; A Clockwork Orange is truly all of these and more.  It is a must-read for anyone who loves true literature.
B000001GF9|2.0|As one would expect from Bernstein, this is a technically well done performace on the orchestra's part.  However, a choral conductor he is not, and the chorus' work in this recording lacks a great deal.  Both the Kyrie and Jesu Christe are ponderous where they should be intense, and the ...Sancto is disjointed rather than dancing through the runs.  The Qui Tollis has wretched balance between the double choirs, and the chorus in the Gloria is overridden by an intrusive bass drum.<br />As an alternative, I recommend John Eliot Gardiner's recording with the Monteverdi Choir.  The solos could perhaps be improved, but the choral movements are unmatched by any other recording.
B0000214G6|5.0|I like the movie.  John and Elizabeth are great together and they could have a real realationship if John was not too self-centered and emotionless.  He acts like a sweet guy who scares his girlfriend with sudden sprouts of anger.  In brief, it is a story of how the modern world makes successful people pay for their time at work.  They become prisoners of solitude and can not feel emphathy for each other unless they loose one another.  Emotionless world pushes John to seek himself somewhere on the edge of sex, love and mazohism.  Elizabeth fell for him but got tired of facing a wall...
B00000ILDE|5.0|Okay, this movie kicks every sort of buttocks imaginable. Is that established? Good. Aliens is in a class all its own, and I must say it's one the greatest  sci-fi films to date. The only complaint with the whole movie that I have is this: It's the future right? Right. Well once the marines' space ship has been successfully destroyed by a pesky alien and they're all stuck on the planet, why couldn't one of them take out a cell phone and say \\"Hey we're pretty screwed down here, send another ship!\\"  Today it's 2002, and everybodies got a freakin' cell phone! The date in that movie is like 4002, and the \\"state of the art marines\\" can't even ringy-dingy their home base, to say their screwed. Other than that the movie's great, I recommend it to anyone in the mood for a thrill ride.
B00005U18E|5.0|This is a fun movie.  I love the plot and how it is done.  I love to see Hugh Grant playing a bad character.  I was so tired of his &quot;weddings and a funeral&quot; image in every movie he made.  It was a real change!  I love Renee she is great and is not uncomfortable of not being attractive in the movie which scares most of the actresses. I wish her other guy was more emotional though... : )
B00000I1OY|4.0|I was able to watch this movie without distraction for the first time in years. I did not remember how powerful this film really is. It keeps you on the edge of your seat from start to finnish (well, almost). Your mind will be working at a furious pace trying to figure out where did Ned come from, what happened to him, why did so many of his friends turn against him and most importantly, what will happen to him after the closing credits. Some of these questions are answered, some are alluded to and some are left up to the viewers imagination.<br />At each pool site, we are introduced to various friends (?) of Neds. We learn that at one time he was the life of the party in beautiful WASPish, Fairfield County Connecticut. What is so fascinating about this movie is that we discover something a little out of kilter at each encounter. A lot is said with just the eye movement of various players. As Ned moves from pool to pool, you will become increasingly aware that Ned's life has gone terribly off track. This man was, two to three years earlier, a pillar of the community with an ideal family and job in New York. What went wrong? We do learn of an affair he had with an actress. Did this lead to his downfall?<br />I will not give it all away but as the movie moves on we learn that Ned is not only not welcomed places where he was once welcomed with open arms, but is now hated.<br />Has Ned been in an instituion the last two years? He is certainly mentally unstable. Did his freinds not care where he was? Where was he living the day he shows up? Not at his beautiful home. We can guess what happened to his family but only in a very general sense.<br />This is a great movie and one that has been ignored (hence no critical review even here, only customer reviews) for ages. I did find the scenes with the 20 year old blond unnessesary. Jumping over horse fences? Please.<br />The last scene was chilling although it was not nessesary to pan the inside of the house, we know by then that it will be empty, cold and barren. It is simply a shell of better days, just like Ned
B00003CY0V|1.0|I want to know why the Finnish characters in this film were speaking german!  There are a reasonable number of people who speak german and finnish in this world to call BS on that.<br />Just stupid.  *maybe* rent this, but only if you have 2 hours to waste on a dumb movie that doesn't even fall into the humorously bad movie category.
B00005OWEG|4.0|*<br />I won't spend much time doing a classic review of this film, as I am sure that everything I would want to express has already been covered by many others.<br /><br />The most important info I can offer is that the purchase of this DVD marks my VERY FIRST TIME ever having seen this Nicolas Cage's uncle's Vietnam War classic -- I had never seen it in its original release, I had never seen any of the televised broadcasts or cablecasts, and I had procrastinated too long when the ''Redux'' version was released in theatres. So in EVERY sense of the word, I took a blind chance on purchasing this DVD! ... And I don't regret it one bit!<br /><br />I typically don't like war movies enough to purchase them -- not even such spectacular epics as ''Platoon'' and Kubrick's ''Full Metal Jacket,'' which I admit are utterly breathtaking films. But ''Apocalypse Now'' is clearly a rare gem among all of them, and I'm glad I took the chance on it!<br /><br />This ''Redux'' version supposedly answers some ambiguous questions that had always baffled the old fans who were familiar with the original release, and upon learning what these scenes were makes me wonder why studio executive types always have to insist on carving away extremely important segments of film just to meet some arbitrary ''time restraints.'' (Chop up, take out and force audiences to rent or purchase ''Director's Cuts'' of films on VHS & DVD ... and the motion picture studio execs remain clueless as to why ticket sales for theatrical releases are steadily going down and down.) The only editorial decision I would have liked to have seen made involved the shameful and silly portrayal of the stranded 'Playboy Bunnies' ...the ditzy & brainless portrayals of the women really hurt the film's credibility and disrupted the entire pace and mood of the film. Coppola should have just insinuated the 'sex-for-trade' scene without actually exposing it...<br /><br />Overall, the slow but chaotic pace and the eerie & generally depressing mood of the film really make it one of the true masterpieces, genuinely deserving of its critical praise.<br /><br />I am actually glad that it took all of these years of waiting before I had a chance to see this film-- either as it was (original theatrical release) or as it should have been (''Redux'') --otherwise I may not have had the genuine appreciation for the film that I now have. Only one other film has had such a profound effect on me, and that was Orson Welles' ''Citizen Kane,'' which I had first seen only a few years ago as part of a special anniversary theatrical re-release.<br /><br />For those of you who are familiar with this film (in either of its versions), I'm not telling you anything you don't already know; For those of you who are not, don't walk past this truly amazing bit of filmmaking history! Everyone should see this film at least once!ake it one of the true masterpieces, genuinely deserving of its critical praise.

0375701427|5.0|Philip Roth has long been one of contemporary America's most popular and gifted writers. In the 1990's, Philip Roth began the seventh decade of his life, and commenced the fourth decade of his publication history. Roth, long the terror of the American literary establishment, has blossomed in his later life, the acerbic tone of his characteristic rants somehow mellowed and deepened by a moving wisdom which reflects a profound self-understanding. 'American Pastoral' is precisely a crystalline distillation of Roth's own experience of the last 50 years of American life and culture, which is evoked in a lush prose, refulgent with dazzling metaphor and imagery. Here, Roth 'digs in' to the culture of the 60's and 70's in a careful, judicious, and (dare I say?) compassionate manner: he explores the intense dynamics of the radical cultural shift and explosion of tradition which accompanied the anti-Vietnam war effort beautifully, and evokes endearingly the concerns and naivete of child- and parent-hood, while situating all of this in the simple yearnings to belong experienced by so many cultural \\"others\\". Despite the emotive qualities of his story (and the telling of it), he is in no way sentimental. Roth (or Nathan Zuckerman, to long time fans) uses the ruptures and discontinuities which shattered the cozy ideals of 'the American Dream' to highlight a fundamental insight into the human condition. Namely, that the world is meaningless, and that it only becomes meaningful through our interaction with it. The recurrent vexations of life are, for Roth, the world's stubborn insistence on non-conformation to our images of it. Despite (and through) Roth's depiction of the devastating heartache brought upon an honest and 'decent' man by his inability to protect his loved ones and to control his surroundings, Roth points beyond the platitudinous moralizing which distorts so many works of art to an at once more realistic and sublime perspective on the world. Roth doesn't tell us 'howto look at the world', rather, he merely reminds us that 'looking at the world' is precisely what we are doing--and nothing more. Altogether, 'American Pastoral' is a controlled, seething, slow-burning explosion of a novel which probes at once the full range of the modern American experience while simultaneously posing and answering some of the most timely and relevant questions facing post-modernity. This book is highly recommended, probably (maybe 'Operation Shylock'?) the greatest (one of the few which deserve the term great) of Roth's 22 fictional publications, and a fabulous capstone to a marvelous and extremely important writing career. Hats off.
B00004Z400|5.0|this cd  and band is really off the hook, but what really got me to like this cd was &quot;change&quot;. I heard it off of &quot;Coolers Revenge-Dragon Ball Z&quot;. I recommend this cd to everyone.
B00003CXWV|1.0|This movie is the worst of it's type to date. More a series of classic rock music videos strung together than anything else, It never pulls you into the world it is trying to create. Donnie Brasco, Goodfellas, even Godfather III. Make this a film I think Johnny Depp should probably try and buy all copies and burn. Get the soundtrack instead. Long and boring non-involving, bad acting and bad wigs make this truly unwatchable.
B00005MKA3|5.0|All I have to say is that &quot;Zimbawae&quot; is probably one of the best Marley songs I've ever heard.  Not to mention &quot;One Drop&quot; &quot;Ride Natty, Ride&quot; and evry other song on the album.  If you love dat reggae music and/or Bob Marley, it's a crime not to own this album.  Late
B000002B30|5.0|Bruce Springsteen is an American hero in a different way from fictional Rocky Balboa. While the boxer shows his  invincibility by beating one rival after another, our boss beats the music chart by his excellent songwriting and his heartful message. And he's only flesh and bone and even at his height he recognizes that his fame will not last long as shown in Glory Days. Bruce is and should be the icon for American's blue-collar mass and after 80s' glory days he returned with the place he belongs. He may not go on producing catchy hit-making songs but his Born To Run motto will stay. Besides hit tracks I like Atlantic City. A nice introduction to music fans new to the Boss. Curious music fans may dig in his 1973 debut. ...And a number of live collections.
0345350499|5.0|this book is GREAT!!!!!!<BR>at the begining i didn't like it a lot but after a few pages,WOW!<BR>i actually lost a few pounds while reading it becaus i read it instead of eating.<BR>besides the fact that it is a very fllowing book and very intresting to read. it also turns your atention to the celtic and christian religeon witch are very interesting. i also recomend to read the ledgends of king arthur, the \\"proper\\" ones, it is very interesting.<BR>all in all, A MUST BOOK!
B00005YXZH|5.0|I don't normally get in to subjecting others to my own musical tastes/preferences, but this is nothing less than a seminal album for any individual with a penchant for what many have taken to labeling roots rock/alt country.  <br />The individual tracks, together with the stunning sum of the whole evident upon the first run-through, prove to be honest and resonant.  Even if you have compiled the CD-R, as I have, the special character of this record makes it well worth the purchase.  Don't think too hard about it; don't waste time rationalizing it.  Own it, play it, and play it again.
0553213105|5.0|Let me begin by saying that, although I have been an Anglophile since the age of eight (for some strange reason!) not every novel from or about England captures my fancy like &quot;Pride and Prejudice&quot; has, through the years...<br />I thoroughly enjoyed reading this book (and was able to read it in England the second time, which really gave its words and sentiments added significance).  What makes it special for me each time I read it is its historical content and reference.  For example, the fact that some of the English people of the times spoke so concisely and brilliantly has always been, for me, a mental pleasure.  The customs of the day have also appealed to me compared to some of the casual ways exhibited in today's world.  (To say I am Victorian at heart would not be wrong...)<br />Although &quot;Pride and Prejudice&quot; mirrors universal truths and concepts, it is the aura of propriety (sometimes abused and falsely applied, such as in the case of the Reverend Mr. Collins, the pompous Lady Catherine de Burgh, and the haughty  Miss Bingley) which I like.  Despite their ability to de-nobilize the demeanor of their time, I still enjoy their antics.  They serve as a meaningful counterpoint to the serious business of living which drives Elizabeth and her sister Jane to seek more high-minded and worthwhile pursuits.  I like &quot;Pride and Prejudice&quot; because it illustrates, once more, that &quot;there's always one in every crowd,&quot; that there exist among the civil gentry those who would thwart and turn back and simply congeal to impress (Mr. Collins, again!)<br />In this same vein, Mrs. Bennett serves as the original &quot;stage mother,&quot; constantly pushing her daughters to the forefront of dances and other situations, wanting them to marry well.  Yet she consistently annoys and insults those about her so her daughters' chances to &quot;marry well&quot; are minimized almost in direct correlation to her pandering.<br />Mr. Bennett is one of my favorite characters, although he is not as clearly-drawn as most of the others.  In him, I see a man of his times, saddled with a silly wife whom he married for looks and not for her intellect, and trying to make the best out of her urgent desires for her daughters' future wealth.  In that regard, he is not so much depressed as resigned, a quiet man who keeps to himself but who also acquiesces to his wife because (alas) he still does love her.  He is caught by son-less fate to have to cede the home over his family's heads to the Reverend Mr. Collins, a cousin.  This causes Mr. Bennett grief but serves the reader as a historical footnote, a sign of the times that, fortunately, has come and gone.<br />Since I have only limited space, I will describe only one more character, Miss Elizabeth Bennett.  Amongst these pages, she has such courage, such intelligence, such a command of the English language, and an acute sense of responsibility in all areas of her life.  (She is fictional, of course, but I find myself hoping I can someday identify with her - not only that, but she gained the affection of the equally-noble Mr. Darcy!)  Elizabeth is the embodiment of cool reserve and ready wit, but she is also quick to comfort.  As she stood out among the other characters in this book, so would a real person like her, during those times.  The historical perspective of Elizabeth's life is informative, pleasing, and remarkable - a worthy history lesson as well as an entertaining novel.
B00005BJ2O|4.0|This soundtrack captures the movie very well. It includes most of the major musical numbers, as well as some pop songs used prominently in the movie. Many people object that it does not contain &quot;Like a Virgin&quot; or &quot;The Pitch (Spectacular Spectacular). I disagree. These songs do not stand as well on their own--without the visual accompaniment and events--as the ones included in the soundtrack.<BR>   I like the soundtrack a lot. Sometimes I listen to it right before bed; it's very comforting. The reason I didn't give it five stars is the organization. I would prefer &quot;Come What May&quot; or something equally evocative of the movie to be the closing track, rather than a cover of &quot;Nature Boy&quot; by David Bowie and Massive Attack. Nature Boy is a great song, and David Bowie does it fabulously--but there is another rendition of the song, also by David Bowie, at the beginning. While this bookends the soundtrack nicely, as it does in the movie, the Massive Attack version is almost nothing like the movie's general sound. It's not what I want at the end. Also, the pop tracks are interspersed with the original movie tracks until about track 10. I often find myself skipping them, not because they are inferior--they are actually quite good--but because I want to get the movie's feeling. This is rather unfair to the other tracks. If they were more separated, I would enjoy it more.<BR>   That said, this is a great soundtrack. Attentive listeners <BR>(who put their volume up high) will notice that at the very beginning of the first track, Ewan McGregor (Christian) says, &quot;This story is about love. The woman I loved is dead,&quot; and that at the very end of the last track, Nicole Kidman (Satine) whispers, &quot;I love you.&quot; I nearly cried the first time I heard that.<BR>   The general point of this whole, long-winded (I apologize) review is that this is a wonderful soundtrack that captures and continues the movie. You may not want to be reminded ofthe movie; once may be enough. But if you want a reminder without the entire experience, this soundtrack is exactly what you need.
B000001G1E|5.0|I have had this set for over 10 years, and it is still on my most played list.  It is amazing to hear beats on rapper's cds that were originally James'.  This is a must for any R&amp;B fan, even hip-hoppers need to check it out for some education. Rock fans will get a kick out of it too.  From the early days, to his 70's peak, James Brown is in a class by himself.  Kicking it for fun, or making a political statement, either way, he can make your feet move.  &quot;The Big Payback&quot; has got to be the most sampled song ever.  James Brown is no joke.
B00005UW7G|2.0|This is an opera that has been recorded and then acted out with the singers lip synchronising to the music. The action is not set in Renaissance Spain as is the norm but in late 18th Century Italy. The actors perform in the standard dress of the day of Haydn and Mozart.<br />In addition to the settings the way the opera is performed is very much as a serious tragedy. The original was meant to be comic. The figure of a page has also been added to the action. The part is a non-speaking (or signing part) and a young man dressed in black follows the Don around at all times. This is presumably symbolic of something that is rather lost. <br />In reality it is hard to think of a film which is so much at odds with the spirit of the subject matter it portrays. One hears music that is full of life, vigour and comic invention. As one hears it one sees on the screen actors portraying a dull lifeless work more like the tedious opening two or three hours of Eisenstien?s Ivan the Terrible. <br />The female leads are also dressed weirdly. Kiri Te Kanawa is dressed in a wig that makes her look like Ronald McDonald. The Don Giovanni portrayed by Mozart is a person who is full of the spirit of life. On screen (as opposed to the musical portrayal) Raimondi portrays him as if he was a low level public servant without a sense of humour. Whilst the music is good the film is to be avoided.
B000053VAF|2.0|ok so i have only seen this and jay and silent bob strike back. i liked jay and silent bob always will since i own jay and silent bob strike back. i would never buy this unless it was for pure idiocity. the story took me nowhere. this disses god. im a very religious person. i did not get this movie.  its that hard to understand. i had to watch it twice to give it 2 stars. ok im a huge fan of kevin smith though. hey why else would i rent mallrats and clerks.
B000002UAO|5.0|It may not be possible to pick the best Beatles album.  Each on seemed to be better than the one before it but &quot;Rubber Soul&quot; remains a standout.<br />This album has too many important songs to really discuss them all.  &quot;Norwegian Wood&quot; has it all--terrific John Lennon lyric, great Paul McCartney harmony and of course George Harrison's stroke of genius inclusion of the sitar which makes &quot;Norwegian Wood&quot; one of the most instantly recognizable songs ever.<br />Just that song alone makes this a memorable album but then one is blown away by &quot;Nowhere Man&quot; with another tremendous, literate Lennon lyric, great harmonies and tremendous guitar.<br />Not enough?  George Harrison gets his moment with &quot;If I Needed Someone&quot; which has to rank amongst the top 10 songs he ever wrote.<br />For me me though the pinnacle of the album is &quot;In My Life&quot; which might deserve the accolade of &quot;best Beatles song ever.&quot;  Certainly it is my favorite Beatles song and again, just a magnificent, unforgettable John Lennon lyric.  Was his writing on any Beatles' album better collectively than his work on &quot;Rubber Soul&quot;?  &quot;In My Life&quot; is as good as a song gets.  Elegant guitar playing by George Harrison.  Ringo Starr's percussion is simple but complex at the same time and some of the best work he ever did as a Beatle.  Their producer George Martin adds the baroque piano solo which transforms &quot;In My Life&quot; into something that Bach might've written (and certainly Johann would've enjoyed and appreciated).  The lyrics are the best part of the song though.  This isn't a song by some rock and roll star. Lennon, who was only in his mid-20s by this time, writes a song that is so contemplative and reflective that you'd swear that it was written by someone decades older.  It is a heart-wrenching, life-celebrating song and given that Lennon was dead only 15 years after writing it, so tremendously poignant.
6305537313|5.0|this is a wonderful movie. Audrey's performance blew me away. she is so incredible. i love audrey. she is the best actress i have ever admired. she was such an incredible woman. so giving and so loving. we miss. her.
B00005JKQZ|1.0|This movie is so predictable. It's like the director worked backward: instead of directing the movie and then see what people think about it, he kept thinking about what people would like to see, and then made the movie (that explains why it won so many awards). He could at least have done this a little more subtle, but the whole movie is gross. Here's an example: Ron Howard needed a genius, right? So what did he do? Did he tried to narrow Nash's personality? No! He gave us the typical genius guy everybody would think of, you know, the guy who can't talk to girls, can't wear a tie... And there are so many other gross details in this movie, the worst being this \\"love-can-solve-any-problems\\" thing.This is soooooooo easy, so predictable, in a word, so CLICHE.
B00005KARK|4.0|My 2 year old daughter loves this movie.  She particularly loves the choo-choo (one of her obsessions right now).   can't believe that in our pc world today that this was re-released--dumbo and the mouse get drunk (accidentally, of course, but this would never have happened if the circus clowns hadn't been boozing it up behind the tent);  they experience this lsd like trip--pink elephants on parade (which is kind of scarey);  and the black crows are definitely supposed to be black.  <br />Nonetheless, this music is enjoyable and the moral is sound. I don't think this is harming my daughter, but I cringe at the fact that she wants to watch it 24/7.  I have to hold out for 2 times a week despite her protests.  I just don't think its healthy for kids to watch the same thing over and over. . . .
B00005JHCP|5.0|I thought this video was very good.  I haven't seen other versions, so I can't compare them, but I think it portrays the book excellently (although the book IS of course, better).  The first tape is the best.  Daniel Radcliffe does a wonderful job playing young David.  The plot also follows the book and even the lines in the book very well.  The character are cast perfectly.  Mr. Murdstone is horrible, Mr. and Mrs. Micawber are exactly how they are in the book! In the second tape, I wish they hadn't cut out the part with the old Doctor, or Tommy Traddles.  They focused more on his relationship with Dora and Agnes in the movie, whereas there are many themes going on at once in the book.  Also some little things, like Agnes doesn't seem to take quite so kindly to Dora in the movie as she does in the book.  But Maggie Smith is excellent as Betsy Trotwood (of course).  Overall, this is a fabulous movie.  Even if you haven't read the book, you'll want to after you see this.
0684857219|1.0|It never ceases to amaze me just how much so-called \\"professional\\" bodybuilders know about building pumped-up, functionally useless tissue, as opposed to building real muscle the natural way. This book is a veritable compendium of just about everything that is WRONG in the sport of modern bodybuilding.<br />As I looked over the workout routines contained within, it became readily apparent that these routines could benefit ONLY those exceptionally genetically disposed for bodybuilding and/or those individuals taking steroids. Of course, I realize that one isn't expected to lift all the workout routines directly from the book, as your workouts should be tailored to your individual needs. However, the amount of revision necessary to make the routines worthwhile to typical drug-free trainees renders this volume worthless. In addition the instructions detailing how the exercises are to be performed are, in some instances, incredibly bad. For example, look at the instructions regarding the bench press. The text clearly states that your feet should be flat on the floor, and is accompanied by a photo of Ahhhnold with his feet on the bench (a DANGEROUS practice). The book is filled with such irregularities, and other downright dangerous exercises as well. The research behind the exercise physiology herein is dubious at best.<br />There is a plethora of photographs of pro bodybuilders, past and present, which are supposedly inspiring. I strongly suspect that many (if not all) of these bodybuilders used or abused steroids, and this doesn't impress or inspire me in the least (neither do heroin addicts.) <br />As for the section on nutrition, it's simply outdated. This nutritional advice may have worked for Ahhhnold when he was in his bodybuilding prime, but remember that his prime was QUITE some time ago (and we've all learned a thing or two since he last competed.) <br />The Bottom Line: Don't waste your money on this book, as it is only useful to genetically gifted and/or drug assisted bodybuilders, and not the general public. If you want SOUND advice regarding building muscle and becoming physically fit, I recommend that you purchase a copy of \\"Beyond Brawn\\" along with \\"The Insider's Tell-All Handbook On Weight-Training Technique\\" (both authored by Stuart Mc Robert.) Your body will thank you for it in the long run.
B00005YXZH|3.0|Techno folk-rock? This sometimes engaging, often silly and pretentious record has lyrics that range from disarmingly sincere (\\"I've got reservations/about so many things/ but not about you.\\") to bad high school journal poetry (\\"I'm an American aquarium drinker/I assasin down the avenue\\") and music that plods along like an old mule when it should gallop like a thoroughbred. (That's s-l-o-w, brother.) Is this what Radiohead hath wrought? The only actual songs I hear are \\"Kamera,\\" \\"Jesus, etc.\\" and the whimsical \\"Heavy Metal Drummer,\\" all of which I like but none of which would cut the mustard on one of the Mermaid Avenue albums. (Tweedy really should hire a lyricist.)<br />Hate to say it, folks, but I'm siding with Reprise on this one...
B000060MMI|5.0|I wasn't sure how Drunken Lullabies would turn out, considering FM's last two CD's were so good.  Normally bands that rock so well live, put out boring CD's.  Let me tell you that Drunken Lullabies is full of foot stomping, jamming, sing along tunes that anyone with a sense of rock music would love.  I've seen these guys live in the Casbah in San Diego and the Laga Lounge in Pittsburgh, this CD serves them well.  Buy it! Support Flogging Molly!
6305842442|1.0|Sorry Ridley,  but that is the fact.  The words directors cut are 100% correct; the theatrical release was 122 minutes and the directors cut is 117 minutes. First of all is this verison 5.1?  If so I don't see it.  What a waste. This [expensive] verison is the same piece of junk dvd that I have left on the store racks for the past 2 years.  No 5.1 & no theatrical = No sale.  Plus the theatrical is Much better.  The directors cut reaks! Hey ridley thanks but you can keep the stupid unicorn scene!<br />Here is how much I loath this movie I consider Bladerunner to be one of the best Scifi every made I own over 400 dvds and I refuse to by anything but the theatical release.
B00005QDW5|4.0|This CD is excellent, if you like -all- of Pink Floyd's music.  This album spans the entire gamut of their work.  If you only like the later stuff, you may want to look elsewhere.  I hadn't heard &quot;See Emily Play&quot; in quite a while, so having a copy (along with other rarities) all on one CD is a real treat.
B000008COG|3.0|Well I've read all the reviews posted here and there are some very mixed views about this album to say the least. I picked this album up used and started listening to it after I'd listening to SUL and the Bon-era stuff every day for weeks on end.The difference if obvious. This album came out in'88,three years after FOTW,and is an attempt at a comeback when they thought they really needed one (this came 2yrs later with TRE). So they got George and Harry back on board who did a fair Mutt Lang style production imitation which sounds like FTATR. Adding some echo to the vocal mix beefs up Brian's steadily decining range. The riffs have more variety as well.Simon Wright seems a competent drummer, but doesn't have that subtle \\"groove\\" used by Phil Rudd which makes drumming that could easily seem boring and repeatative into a beat that makes foot tapping involuntary. The songs: Heatseeker is a song that every fan should like and displays the kind of cross-cut riffing that sets the Young brother's apart from other rhythm-lead duos. That's The Way.. is a welcome return to the form of the Bon-era albulms, and just listen to Angus' solo in Go Zone. Another example is the solo in Nick of Time which is an underated song and one which they played live on the BUYV tour but then discarded. Ruff Stuff is a good song in the style of Moneytalks, and Two's Up is a good example of the double-entendre that Bon perfected complete with suitably seedy lyrics.Only week points in my opinion are Meanstreak, which never really kicks into gear, and Some Sin.. which is spoiled for me by Simon Wright's cymbol's during the chorus. Was he trying to be inventive? This was one of the last times they tried to make a recording in the style of BIB or FTATR, which is preferable for me 'cause I like the direction They're going in now better.
0449002632|3.0|The hardcover is close to 830 pages so this took me a while to finish.  Each story is quite fascinating.  I happened to see the movie LION IN THE WINTER with Katherine Hepburn &amp; a very young Anthony Hopkins during the middle of the book.  I would highly recommend that because it takes you to that period.  I found some of the stories better than others but overall it was quite an informative novel that intermingled a lot of London history.  I've been visiting London a lot lately so it makes it more interesting to me when I go by Southwark, Buckingham Palace, Fortnum &amp; Mason, St. Pauls Cathedral and/or see specific street names and realize some of the British history.  The City of London has truly turned into quite a melting pot.
B00005RY7X|1.0|Terrible.  It's as if Beavis and Butthead have finally made an album.  This guy must have the best publicity agent.  Seriously, this is bad.  And he managed to get a whole 35 minutes?  Nice work.  This album is Jello Biafra's worst nightmare.<br />This music is for guys who go to bars with a pocketful of roofies.  Just pure nonsense.  Anyone who bought this disc will be placing it on their shelf along side &quot;Who Let the Dogs Out&quot;.  People who bought this probably also bought albums by Jackyl and Snow (you remember him from the earlier 90's - &quot;Informer, blah blah blah blah Informer&quot;.<br />If you haven't yet purchased this album, please don't...
0743201140|3.0|This book really is a collection of three books.<br />The first part of the book argues that we all have certain talents that are fixed in our brains early in our lives. According to the authors, we should move away from focussing exclusively on our and others weaknesses and look more towards developing our natural strengths. <br />This part of the book left me with a somewhat unconvinced feeling - apart from self-evident insights - as it is relatively short, relies heavily on anecdotal evidence and often sounds more like philosophy than like science.<br />Then there is - as the title suggests- the self-help/self-evaluation part. The authors are members of the Gallup organization, which has developed a scientific method and a tool that allow the grouping/evaluation of people according to their talents. Due to the high amount of experience that Gallup has in gathering and evaluating data as well as the discussions in the book this part works very convincing and academically sound. The tool has been implemented on the internet and anyone with an internet connection and a unique copy of the book can evaluate her-/himself. This is the core of the book. It is highly convincing and required reading for anyone in business.<br />The third and final part of the book covers ways in which you / your manager / your organization can implement the insights of the two previous parts. Here we again read a lot of common sense and well-meant advice, but no research to back up the advice.<br />The shift in paradigm for the general public presented here is so large that the authors must have felt obliged to write parts I and III. However, these parts need to ripen further.<br />Buy this book. Then wait for the next revised edition or for books carrying this work on.
B000065U1N|1.0|If your looking for a war movie along the lines of Apocalypse Now, Saving Private Ryan, or even Platoon, you'll be horribly disappointed with Blackhawk Down.  The flick is pure big-budget, low-intellect Hollywood, and it's obvious the \\"creative talent\\" behind the scenes wasn't even smart enough to locate the junior-filmaker's recipe book.  How many times do we have to hear, \\"tell my wife I love her *gasp, wheeze*...\\" only to hear, \\"You can tell her yourself, you can make it!\\"  Gawd, not again!<br />The characters were exaggerated and dimensionless, the symbolism (when it was actually included) was crammed down our throats, and important details totally ignored.  Since when do soldiers just hop on a Humvee to join his buds in combat without first checking with their senior officers?<br />If you like truly senseless violence, then get this movie.  But if you like the dynamic interplay compelling dialogue, or the satisfaction of relating to a particular character in a hellish circumstance, then seek your entertainment elsewhere.
B00005RFQ5|5.0|I've had the album for about 8 months now and still listen to it daily.  It is a flat out masterpiece.  The more you listen to it, the better it gets.<br />Alan
B00005JKCF|5.0|I got to see an advanced screening of this film and (with slight exaggeration).  It is the best movie ever!  Tobey Maguire IS Peter Parker!  Much more so than X-Men, when you watch this film, you are IN the Marvel Universe.  It is like Alex Ross's Marvels brought to life.  I was doubtful when David Koepp wrote the screenplay because he can't write a good sentence - let alone a good screenplay.  The few clunky bits of dialogue (usually between Peter and MJ) I attribute to him.  Sam Raimi hits the exact right tone with this movie though.  He doesn't dwell on things we don't care about and is true to the spirit of the comic.  There are a few bits of CGI that are a little awkward, but you've all ready seen them on the trailer.  The acting is pitch-perfect.  Willem Defoe is great as the Green Goblin.  Norman Osborne isn't a 2-dimentional comic-book villain - he's not pure evil - he is a good man who's dark side is released through the Goblin formula.  The Green Goblin HATES Spider-Man but Norman Osborne LOVES Peter Parker.  The only thing wrong with the movie is the final note it ends on - but I guess it has to set up a sequel.  Besides, we know the story anyway.
2218717166|5.0|I purchased this book while in France last fall. I also own 501 French verbs, which I love, but this book is great because it helps you conjugate any and all verbs. Plus, it all fits into one neat little volume. It's helpful that the instructions are in French because you learn some good vocabulary as you go along. If you also own Bescherelle La Grammaire and L'orthographe, you have a great French reference selection in a fraction of the space taken up by other books!
B00005JKYS|5.0|An inspiring movie that demonstrates how courage and character enables one to overcome any adversity. It shows how these qualities allows ordinary people to do amazing things when called upon. This story does credit to those of us who were in the military during the Vietnam War. Even though it was a lousy war, the people who fought (and died) in it deserve to be remembered for what they did - serve their country. This movie helps that happen.
B00003CXTG|4.0|I thought this movie was outstanding. It was slow in the beginning, but it started to speed up as the movie progressed. Outside the battle scenes I thought there was too much kissing. I mean it was just like the Titanic but on land. The graphics were great and the movie was very intense.
B000007R0S|5.0|This album introduced me to Eagles-one of the greatest bands of the 70s and probably of all time and I should say that it left a lasting impression.  I can listen to songs like &quot;Hotel California&quot;, &quot;Love will keep us alive&quot; &quot;Tequila sunrise&quot; and &quot;Girl from yesterday&quot; over and over again, they will never lose that magical touch.  Whatever genre of music you are interested in, this album is worth giving a try !!
0385484518|5.0|Not being a big fan of readig, I could not put this book down for a second. This book gave my a whole new outlook on life. I really enjoyed reading how Morrie took life and appreciated what some of us forget to. I would recommend this book to anyone and everyone!!! I give it 5 stars++.
B000002LKF|5.0|If you are expecting a &quot;Graceland&quot; like I was, you will be disappointed in the beginning. Keep that CD, and it will grow on you like there is no tomorrow!
0875428940|5.0|Unlike an earlier reviewer, one of the things I like best about Robin Wood's deck is that all the people have personality, and not all of them are young and beautiful. Troubling cards have troubled people and some of the cards have slightly disturbing pictures. Some of the people are old, some young, some happy, some sad, some greedy, some triumphant...one thing that I love is that each person has a distinctive expression, and you can tell what they are thinking just by looking at them. This deck is also a lot more interesting to look at than the Rider-Waite Deck--Robin Wood, although she sticks mostly to that traditional style, has made each card distinctively her own. What I love in a Tarot deck is when you can look at a card and have an idea of what it means without looking in a book to help you, and you definitely can do that with this deck.
0060955775|5.0|Paulo Coelho has done it again. What a fantastic book! It keeps your mind wondering about the different meanings of life and the goals that we think we want to achieve. Wonderful prose!
B000060P79|5.0|This is definitely an awesome CD if you like Pop Punk.  I just happen to stumble upon it one day and I'm glad I did.  &quot;I'm Just a Kid&quot; is an awesome song.  I really like &quot;Meet you There&quot; as well.  Every song is good, however.
6301697707|4.0|If you like cheesy horror movies, Tremors may be for you.  But if you are looking for originality, I doubt you'll be impressed.  Still, the actors do a reasonably good job and there are moments of shining comedy, such as the pole vaulting scene and the one where the aging couple kills a giant subterranean monster with nothing but firearms (way to go!).  Still, I really don't like it when they portray all beastly animals as evil.<br />As usual, Kevin Bacon saves the day with his naughty-but-nice personality, ladies-man charisma, and heroic deeds in character.
0893860220|5.0|Please be forewarned. I ordered from a marketplace seller. I got a different print than what I had expected. Please make sure you check with the seller first.<br />Other than that, it is an excellent book. I gave my first copy to my father. I am ordering another copy for myself.
0748662529|5.0|History, memory, and place all play central roles in Smith's beautifully crafted detective novel. &quot;We don't forget,&quot; protagonist Mma Ramotswe muses. &quot;Our heads may be small, but they are as full of memories as the sky may sometimes be full of swarming bees, thousands and thousands of memories, of smells, of places, of little things that happened to us and which come back, unexpectedly, to remind us who we are.&quot; This quote is indicative of the manner in which &quot;Precious&quot; Ramotswe solves the mysteries that she confronts - she reaches deep into her own identity, her country of Botswana, her family, and her experiences to feel her way through various investigations. <br />Ramotswe accepts Africa, with its blemishes, its various problems. Perhaps her intention to open a &quot;Ladies' Detective Agency&quot; has at its root an essential desire to address the roots of these problems from a uniquely African angle. Ramotswe realizes that, in her detective efforts, she is more successful when she relies upon her instincts and her knowledge of her country than upon any Western standards of detection. Similarly, her Detective Agency is a demonstration that Africa's future need not rely upon Western standards; Botswana can travel a parallel path to Western culture, and Africa should not be judged by Western ideals. Ultimately, the parallel between Ramotswe and Africa results in a declaration of the beauty of both; Precious is &quot;mother, Africa, wisdom, understanding, good things to eat, pumpkins, chicken, the smell of sweet cattle breath, the white sky across the endless, endless bush, and the giraffe that cried, giving its tears for women to daub on their baskets.&quot; Trevor's descriptions of Africa are superb and his female detective is bound for great things.
6305451591|5.0|The characters in this movie are so down to earth and so genuine.  The depth of love expressed in this movie is a rarity these days. The commitment between this man and his wife exhibits a role model that is so real yet so absent from the average movie these day. Furthermore, I thoroughly enjoyed the music from the record Guido played for his wife.  I enjoy classical music but am not familiar with this particular selection. I could not recognize whether it is a classical piece from the past.  I would love to know so I can purchase the audio...
0679777547|5.0|In The Club Dumas, Reverte takes the idea of the novel-within-a-novel to an entirely new, compelling level. The levels of references within the novel are rich, nearly impenetrable, from the more obvious connection to Dumas's Three Musketeers to the fact that the central female character is named Irene Adler, who was &quot;the woman&quot; in Conan Doyle's Sherlock Holmes story, &quot;A Scandal in Bohemia.&quot; The Club Dumas is a mystery about books, and Corso is a book detective. The reader must act as a detective as well, sorting through the woodcuts, the diagrams, and the references in order to follow Corso's journey. <br />Reverte is successful in that he creates an experience for the reader that mirrors Corso's own experiences; whether that experience is enjoyable for the reader remains to be seen. &quot;Books play that kind of trick,&quot; Reverte writes, and the tricks within this book can actually reach the point of tiresome at times. Nevertheless, this remains one of the most fascinating books I have ever read. The narrative style is compelling and rich, even if it takes a bit of time to be fully digested. <br />The Club Dumas is a testament to bibliography and the treatment of books as physical objects as well as intellectual entities. The books within the novel interact with each other as they interact with the characters and with the reader. There are many ways to read this novel, but if nothing else, Reverte's novel is a love story to the book. It is difficult, if not impossible, to read it without feeling Corso's, or Reverte's, emotional connections to text.
B00005QZ7U|1.0|Yes, I admire their guts in trying to do something new here.  However, listening to poorly performed covers of pop songs, loosly tied together by a plot derivative of La Traviata really is not that much fun.  If you want a pop music video, flip on MTV.  If you want La Traviata, check with your local opera company.  If you want leggy women walking around in corsets and garter belts, see if you can find someone with a recording of Victoria's Secret's tv special from a year back.<br />The acting is heavily overdone, and as alluded to above, the singing is quite poor (Nicole Kidman tries to cover up her inability to sing by singing in a really soft, breathy fashion that sounds passable, untill you realize that's what she's doing, and Ewan McGregor tends to speak, rather than sing, his lyrics).<br />All in all, the movie seems very clever because it brings together many different elements.  However, no element is strong enough to stand on its own, resulting in a very weak, if diverse, production.
B000002J1H|5.0|This is the album that introduced me to Yes. Unfortunantly i missed them while they were in their prime, however there music still thrives today. Going for the One has everything you could ask for in a rock album. Fast rock songs, Slow beautiful ballads, and a bit of experimenting to define the Yes sound. The Album starts out with the title track. It rocks hard and fast with some awesome &quot;southern rock Style&quot; Slide gutair. Next is Turn of the Century, a moving ballad which starts out with just the gutair and jons voice, of course thats all we really need. After this parallel opens with Rick Wakeman on the organ accompanied by the gutair. It is an awesome classic rock song. After that is Wonderous Stories, another great ballad with some of Jons best vocals. Finally comes Awaken, Definantly The best song Yes has ever written. It starts out with Rick doing some mighty fancy work on the keyboards and turns into a 15 minute rock epic.. It never drags, always builds, and at the end slows down for a nice soft ending. Perfect. One of the great things about this album is how it is set up. Fast rock song, soft ballad, Fast rock song, Soft ballad, Huge Epic ending. You are never bored or rocked out. Definantly a must-have for any Yes fan.
0380778556|5.0|After knowing Maxim de Winter for only a few weeks, the narrator marries him and is taken back to his estate Manderley on the coast of England.  However, upon arrival things do not go as the new Mrs. de Winter planned because the memory of Rebecca, Maxim's first wife, continually haunts her.  Rebecca's belongings remain untouched, the servant Mrs. Danvers continually comments on how beautiful and amazing Rebecca was, and the narrator begins to feel she will never live up to the seemingly flawless ways Rebecca ran Manderley.  As the narrator begins to wonder if even Maxim loved Rebecca more than herself, she prepares for a ball and is unknowingly convinced by the sly Mrs. Danvers to wear the same ball gown Rebecca wore the year before.  Just as the new Mrs. de Winter is about to give up hope, the story of the seemingly perfect Rebecca begins to unfold, and the secrets of Rebecca's death are revealed.  Daphne du Maurier is a hauntingly beautiful writer with sinister and gothic undertones.  She immediately draws readers into the stormy world of Manderley and leaves them with unexpected psychological twists, throwing traditional definitions of good and evil to the wind.
B00005YXZH|1.0|Someone else just as disappointed as I was for this disc...I bought it the first day, anticipating it like no other album this year.  First listen I thought, this is &quot;deep stuff.&quot;  Give it time.  Half a dozen times thru I feel the same as the first-sounds for the sake of sounds and disjointed music, especially toward the end.
B00005JKQX|5.0|This is the finest performance by the finest actor we have. Despite the controversy over what was deleted from Nash's life, the film itself rises to emotional heights that will call you back to see it again and again<BR>  Russell Crowe is, from the first moment you see him at Princeton in 1947, totally gone into this character, unrecog-nizable as himself in other roles, or himself in the role called \\"real life.\\" <BR>  You will begin to realize all over again what acting IS watching him on the screen. This kind of commitment to the art of it hasn't been seen in a generation of Hollywood-driven, middle-<BR>class, easyboy lead men. Crowe is down, intense, blue-collar no bull..creating whatever it takes from touched to tenderized by his demons. No one else shows inner struggle and feeling so well. See if you don't agree. Then go back and watch his earlier triumphs.<BR> Do you really care that he drinks beer a lot? And isn't polite about it all? C'mon Americans. This was clearly the most complex performance of any actor in years. Don't believe anything else.
B00005JKJA|4.0|First, let me address the lack of chapter selections in this movie: bad choice.  Bad!  The movie is super long, and if you don't have time to watch the whole thing in one sitting, it would be nice if you could advance to the point where you had to leave off.  If there had been chapters, this movie would have gotten five stars.<br /><br />Secondly, the plot of this movie doesn't matter.  At least, not to me.  While most movies tell a discernible story, Lynch films usually provide the viewer with a subjective experience unique to him or her.  When I'm watching a long, moody scene in a Lynch film, I feel like it's distorting my emotions, and as I ponder why things are happening on the screen, how the movie is mirroring life, I develop thoughts about how our world actually works.<br /><br />Lynch portrays life in a way that is totally unique and genuinely interesting.  Mulholland Drive works not only on this level, but also as an original portrayal of Hollywood.  It also delivers quite a few genuinely funny moments.  Plus, the women in this movie are incredibly beautiful.<br /><br />If it wasn't for the lack of chapters, definitely a five!  He went out on a limb, I know he wants you to watch the whole thing through, but you don't always have 3 hours to sit and watch a film.<br /><br />-- JJ Timmins
B00003CXI1|3.0|Have you read the book \\"Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone\\"?  If you have then you know the entire plot of this movie-- if you haven't-- here's a brief synopsis:  A young boy named Harry Potter is an orphan and lives with his only family-- his horrible Uncle Vernon, Aunt Petunia, and cousin Dudley.  His life with these people is awful-- they treat him like a \\"dog that rolled in something smelly\\" (to quote the novel) and make him sleep in the cupboard under the stairs.  One day Harry receives a mysterious letter but his Uncle snatches it away and destroys it before Harry can read it.  Soon, more and more letters come and Uncle Vernon starts to go mad-- he uproots the family to get away from the thousands of letters addressed to Harry.   <br />      The next night a giant man barges in on the family and delivers a letter to Harry (one of the same that plagued Uncle Vernon)-- it's his acceptance letter to Hogwart's School of Witchcraft and Wizardry.  Harry is a wizard!  The rest of the story involves Harry's first year of learning magic, making friends, playing Quidditch (like soccer on broomsticks) and finding out more and more about his past and his parents-- apparently he's famous in the world of magic!<br />      Ok, it's a great story and the novels have captured the imaginations of children and adults alike.  The Harry Potter books are a phenomenon and the movie has been greatly anticipated.  Fans will not be displeased with the film when it comes to the story line-- director Chris Columbus stayed true to the book in most respects (many small details are left out and some events have been altered just a little in order to help move the plot along better).  The film was two and a half hours long, if all the little details had been left in the film, who knows how much longer it would have been.<br />      Now, the only thing that might disappoint those who are hard to please (like me) are the special effects.  The movie is about wizardry and magic, yet there areonly a few scenes in which anything magical happens.  It would have been nice to see more magical things, especially in the class rooms (hardly any scenes about that at all-- which really disappointed me).  The special effects that were there, some were fine, some were good, and others were laughable.  Ever see \\"The Mummy Returns\\"?  Remember the end with the Scorpion King animation?  Some of the animations were that bad....but not all of them.<br />     So, do I recommend this film?  Sure.  It was fun and it's a good story-- obviously, or else the book wouldn't have been a hit in the first place.  It is a little long...2 1/2 hours will do a number on your rear, make sure you've got a comfy chair!  If you haven't read the books and you enjoy films in the genre of fantasy then you will like Harry Potter.  If you did read the books, you'll be happy that nothing important was left out and nothing was bastardized-- (think \\"Circle of Friends\\").  You'll enjoy it I'm sure....I'm not sure if you'll love it....but you'll enjoy it.  I dunno, maybe I should watch it again....maybe I'll end up loving it.  But right now, when someone asks me I say \\"Ehhhh...it was good I guess\\".  Take it for what you will.
0792153189|4.0|Deep Impact was not the movie I expected after the first time I watched it.  After seeing the cover art of the video box, I thought this must be a movie filled with special effects, showing the destruction of the planet after a large asteroid impacts.  Instead, deep impact takes on a different meaning.  It doesn't refer to the deep impact of an asteroid (which is really a comet instead)  but refers to the deep impact this event has on human society.  What you get with Deep Impact is an emotional story with a lot of meaning.  Don't expect a whole lot of special effetcs until the very end, only a minute or two.  If you prefer a movie with more action, Armageddon may be the one to watch.  But if you want a movie with a lot of heart, Deep Impact my friend.
B00003CXSP|2.0|Unfortunately, despite the cast and the hype the film falls flat.  The plot is contrived and predictable just like all other slasher movies....I think it's a prerequisite.  Some new and interesting characters are introduced but we only get a \\"taste\\" for who they are and their motivations.  It seems like they were included only to help move the plot along....the means to an end.  A very disgusting, Itchy-and-Scratchy-esq end that if I hadn't eaten dinner two hours beforehand would have definitely made me sick.<br />      The plot seemed blurry and unfocused, but maybe I just had a hard time paying attention.  I often found myself becoming distracted by attempting to replace Julianne Moore with Jodie Foster.  That's not a knock on Julianne Moore, it's just hard to replace the original actress....especially when the role won her the Academy Award.  Despite the script, Anthony Hopkins had a \\"delicious\\" performance.  Sorry, there were just so many food related (and totally lame) allusions in the film; it must have rubbed off on me.<br />      Hanns Zimmer (\\"Gladiator\\") wrote the score.....no complaints here.  He did a good job.  Ridley Scott was the director.  Too bad, he was really on a role.  Maybe I'm being too harsh, he didn't write the script after all.....he just directed it.  He did, however, recycle a scene from his last blockbuster \\"Gladiator\\"....can you guess which part I'm referring to?<br />      Recommendation: The film lacks the intelligence and suspense that made \\"Silence of the Lambs\\" such a success.  However, \\"Hannibal\\" does provide your daily recommended serving of gore and cheesy innuendos (in reference to eating).  Don't expect much more from this movie than blood and the occasional cannibalistic cooking technique.
0671027344|5.0|\\"The Perks of Being a Wallflower\\" is the most realistic account of growing up I have ever read.  Charlie is an observer of everything that goes on around him, but rarely observes himself and his emotional past.  Charlie's life story starts to leak out of the pages, and the book will keep you interested.  Please, read this book!  It's worth every penny.  Plain and simple.
B00005O5CM|4.0|What thought crossed your mind when you first heard about this movie?  I was thinking that \\"Legally Blonde\\" was just another title for \\"Clueless 2\\" and I wondered where Alicia Silverstone would fit in.  Still, I thought it looked saccharine, sweet, Bubblicious, and fun....and fun it is.<br />       The plot revolves around Reese Witherspoon's character, Elle Woods, a blonde, beauty queen, perfect, Barbie doll, babe.   But not only does Elle look perfect, but she acts perfectly too....I'll get more into that aspect of her character later.  Anyway, Elle's perfect GQ boyfriend Warner, is about to go off to Harvard Law and instead of proposing to her he dumps her.  He tells Elle that if he wants to be a senator by the time he's 30 (uh, good luck) he needs a more serious girl-- a Jackie, not a Marilyn-- as he so aptly puts it.  Elle is just not serious enough for him.  Unfortunately, Elle is seriously in love with Warner and doesn't want to lose him.  She devises a plan to get him back-- she'll go to Harvard Law too (\\"What, like it's hard?\\", she says).<br />      The rest of the story involves how Elle deals with the nerds at Harvard, the attitudes of East Coasters, and scary sadistic law professors.  As if all that is not enough....Elle also has to cope with Warner's horrible, mean, super [nasty] fiancé who makes it a point to humiliate Elle whenever possible.  She's a real meany!  Elle pulls through and eventually realizes that she really is a smart girl with a great legal mind (in her own way)....oh, not to mention a great sense of style and knowledge about fashion.<br />      Overall, the story is really cute and very enjoyable.  There was only one scene that really made me roll my eyes and think, \\"D'oh!  Gimme a break!\\".  The main reason I really liked \\"Legally Blonde\\" was because of Elle's character.  She's beautiful and perfect and looks like a Malibu Barbie....but she is also very self assured and confident.  She doesn't try to change herself for others and shestays true to herself despite ridicule.  Also, when things get tough for her she always responds in an almost saintly manner...she \\"kills 'em with kindness.\\"  She always tries to be nice to others and always has a kind word.  I thought it was a very positive message.<br />Recommendation: I thought \\"Legally Blonde\\" was a great movie.  It was very funny and entertaining.  I enjoyed \\"Legally Blonde\\" much more.  It was a lot of fun and it had a great message-- be yourself!
0380789035|2.0|I'm sorry.  I don't know what other people saw in this book that I must have overlooked, but I found it a real yawn-invoking book.  It's much too long and has far too many occasions where the story just meanders off into left field without really coming back.  There really seems to be no point to this novel.  Surely, it's interesting getting just a grain of information on numerous gods of old, but the trip is just too long and unfulfilling.  When I finished the book, I put it down and muttered &quot;What a waste of time&quot; to myself.<br />I really liked Stardust and Good Omens, but this book is nowhere near as good.  It was an effort to read this, unlike most authors I enjoy (Tolkien, Terry Brooks, Pratchett, etc.).
B00005V0X5|5.0|I love this release of the album.  It has great songs to begin with, and now it sounds better.  The bleeping during &quot;These Boots&quot; is very funny, and I think they made their point in doing it.  Any album with &quot;The Mechanix&quot; on it is a must have, so check this one out!
B000002MUW|5.0|I personally think this is one of Madonna's better albums. I think of this as the continuation of erotica because of the track human nature otherwise it could be whole new thing. In this album Madonna brings out her more depressive side as she seems to point out the negative things in life(hear sanctuary)tracks I thought were the best were Survivor, Secret, don't stop, inside of me, human nature (is the best), bedtime story and take a bow. the rest seem to be mostly depressing ballads which i thought weren't half bad but sounded somewhat the same(forbidden love, sanctuary and love tried to welcome me)If you were a fan of erotica this is the album for you however for retro 80s madonna fans i'd preview this before purchasing it!
B00005JKL8|2.0|Owen Wilson must have trained for a marathon prior to making this movie because that's all he did. Yes there is a lot of action but it's mostly him....running.<br />I was expecting to see him shoot it out and do some type of Rambo'ing action with a little comedy mixed in, but unfortunately that didn't happen.<br />The movie is a definite rental, but in the end it's rather disappointing.
B00005Q66T|4.0|GHV2 is a great album that you should defenetly have in your collection, especially if you are a Madonna fan. The album is filled with hits that will groove you on from track to track nonstop. However perfect it may see, the album is not a 5star album because it failed to add some great singles such as &quot;Rain&quot; and &quot;Bad Girl&quot;. Thankfully &quot;American Pie&quot; was left out of the album which leads me to say that was a smart move. With such great tracks like &quot;Erotica&quot;, &quot;Bedtime Story&quot;, &quot;Beautiful Stranger&quot;, &quot;Ray Of Light&quot;, &quot;Frozen&quot;, &quot;Don't Tell Me&quot; and &quot;Music&quot; this album is doomed to be ANOTHER success for the world's favorite Material Girl, Madonna. All I can say is &quot;Way To Go!&quot;
B00005JKNC|5.0|Let me start by saying I'm not a fan of the madcap Jim Carrey.  I watched this movie only because the free oscar screener came my way, and sat for the first few minutes with my finger on the \\"Stop\\" button, ready to press it the second he pulled a face.<br />I was in for a massive surprise!  I absolutely loved it!  It's gentle love story and the wonderful small-town characters (who couldn't adore Martin Landau?) were a movie in themselves, but the breath-taking Hollywood communist witch-hunt added an amazing dimension to an already enthralling tale.<br />It's a movie which makes you think - so recently, this staggering event took place.  For once, it's the small guy whose side you are on as he battles through this shady and forgotten piece of recent US history.  Throw in a passable non-face-pulling performance from Jim Carrey and the gentle characters he ends up with, and there's a movie I recommend to anyone, without hesitation!
B00003CXZ4|4.0|This is one movie where it pays to pay close attention.  The movie runs backwards.  It starts with the camera focused on a Polaroid instant picture developing-and showing a man who has just had his brains blown out.  The movie proceeds to explain how things got to this point through a series of backward looking sequences that develop the plot in reverse.<br />Guy Pearce plays Leonard Shelby, hunting down the man who raped and murdered his wife. The problem is that \\"the incident\\" that robbed Leonard of his wife also stole his ability to make new memories. Unable to retain a location, a face, or a new clue on his own, Leonard continues his search with the help of notes, Polaroid's, and even homemade tattoos for vital information.  Pearce does an exemplary job of projecting he \\"condition\\" he suffers from and the director provides ample illustrations of how others can exploit his condition.  <br />The suspense of the movie lies not in discovering what happens, but in finding out why it happened, as well as in trying to figure out which of the cast of eccentric and volatile characters are aiding, exploiting or hindering Lenny as he proceeds with his mission.<br />The acting is uniformly impressive.  This represents one of the best-and best used-ensemble casts I've seen in a long, long time.<br />The movie moves along at a torrid pace even though there really isn't all that much action.  This is a cerebral thriller. If your idea of a great movie is special effects, bodies, car chases and gun play, is not your flick.<br />For a movie like this to succeed the editing must be first rate-the jarring backward thrust of the sequences is distracting enough in itself, so the other aspects of continuity that editing can provide must be present consistently.  The editing and direction, for that matter, are both first rate.  The editing also contains the clues that provide the answers to what's really going on.  It bears repeating, this is a movie you have to pay attention to.<br />If you do, you are in for a treat!
B00004ZD69|5.0|At first listen you think this should be used as the score for some film.  It's vast, moving, subtle, brutal, emotional all rolled into one.  This group of 9 talented musicians lead you on a wonderous journey of sound that just sweeps you away.  I have to say that Storm is my favourite, but they're all amazing.  Movements building to crescendos, and then you come crashing down to be built up again.  At times it's like they just got together and jammed and this is the result, but they repeat the performance live as well.  Sleep is moving with the sample of Murray Ostril talking about Coney Island, and sleeping on the beach there when he was young.<BR>I can't praise this album enough, buy it and enjoy.
B00005JKJA|5.0|I must admit I have not yet had a chance to look at the DVD of this movie. But the last time I was comparably impressed by a new release dates back a couple years now, when I saw Eyes Wide Shut for the first time. The New York Film Critics chose Mulholland Drive as best picture of the year and I certainly don't think they erred in doing so. Two films came out last year that employed unconventional narrative techniques, Memento and this picture, yet who could be in doubt about which work is the more challenging of the two? Memento has an arresting premise, but no one who watches the beginning of the movie closely should miss the premise or experience difficulty in following what comes after. By contrast, in Mulholland Drive David Lynch is constantly throwing the viewer off balance. It would be going a bit far to compare Lynch's new creation with Alain Robbe-Grillet and Alain Resnais' Last Year at Marienbad, but hardly any movie of equivalent narrative complexity,visual richness, and difficulty has been made in the United States for years.<BR>I have reviewed Mulholland Drive on my Web site (davesothermovielog.com), but I wanted to record some additional comments here. First of all, the movie is not a crossword puzzle to be deciphered by filling in the blank spaces. To his credit, Lynch leaves some of his spaces permanently void--not to be filled in at all, not even by the most ingenious exegete. Second, the film does have a recognizable subject, which is not Hollywood so much as the act of making motion pictures itself. The nearest thing to a narrative Ariadne's thread through the labyrinth of Mulholland Drive concerns the planned production of a new movie in Hollywood that even affords Lynch an opportunity to throw in a brilliant production number with 1950s decor that puts to shame anything in Moulin Rouge!<BR>This highly fluid story line allows Lynch to cover a lot of territory, including a devastatingly funny look at present day movie financing as experienced by an arrogant, wannabe auteur. (I have the feeling the director was settling old scores in some of these scenes.) But what Mulholland Drive is \\"about,\\" is none of the areas the film passes through en route to its conclusion. Several famous movies about the movie industry--among them, not only Billy Wilder's Sunset Boulevard, but also George Cukor's A Star Is Born, and Robert Mulligan's Inside Daisy Clover, based on the novel by Gavin Lambert--have dealt with the way stars become alienated in their screen images. Norma Desmond ends up acting out offscreen the goofy roles she played onscreen at the height of her fame, and at the end of A Star Is Born, the viewer might well want to ask, \\"Who is the 'real' Mrs. Norman Maine?\\" Esther Blodgett? Vicky Lester? But Lynch, I think, pushes the dialectic of images and identity considerably farther than any American director has done since Orson Welles made Citizen Kane and The Lady from Shanghai.<BR>Revision is a characteristic mode of postmodernism. But often what starts as a homage--for example, to a traditional genre like the musical--almost involuntarily degenerates into parody, as Moulin Rouge! well illustrates. In the past, Lynch has not, in my opinion, always succeeded in walking this particular tightrope with the greatest of aplomb--the end of Wild at Heart seems to me an absolute disaster in that regard. But the \\"revision\\" here is truly \\"re-vision,\\" seeing over again film genres and Hollywood history, in a very large sense of the word, but most importantly \\"re-viewing\\" the ever problematic task of telling a story with images.
0823016285|5.0|I got this book to develop more range as an illustrator and I'm very pleased with the quantity of examples, depth of instruction, and quality of the material.<br />This book contains detailed information on how to draw all the structures of the face and helps the reader to develop the ability not just to draw various facial expressions, but to understand the physiological occurrences that create different expressions. As any student of life drawing or anatomy knows, it's good to know what the engine underneath the hood is doing to get the exterior right!<br />The author painstaking guides you through the process of drawing the major facial features, starting simply with the gross structures and paring down to a high level of detail.<br />This book is a valuable addition to my collection of illustration books and I would recommend it to any illustrator, would-be illustrator, or casual artist who wants to develop her or his skills.
B00003CXI0|5.0|I recently saw this video, and imediatly loved it, I have read all four books, and am, anticipating the release of the fith book. I would recomend this particular movie to anyone, parents, children, grandparents, teachers, anyone who enjoys reading would love this movie, and  I do believe that people who don't even enjoy reading would love this movie! I think it's the best thing i've seen in years! I must admit that I even went back and saw the movie once after already seeing it with a friend, who also had read the books, and enjoyed them too. You will fall in love with the charcters, while watching this film.Well, this is all I have to say for now, but I highly encourage you to go see this movie, or at least rent it, and i'm sure after doing that, you will want to buy it!
B00004ZELJ|5.0|I am a huge fan of the Backstreet BoyS and I have been for the last five years!!! I think that this DVD with their live performance just keeps proving why they are the worlds greatest band!!!<BR>The DVD was really fun to watch I watch it every single day!! The performances for Quit Playing Games with My Heart was awesome!!! Actually the whole concert was unbelievably awesome!!!<BR>THEY ROCK!!!
6305327084|5.0|I rented this DVD not knowing what to expect, and it turned out to be one of the best movies I've seen in a while.  It is an excellent character piece, with some standout performances.  The greatest compliment that I can give this film is that I did not want it to end.  The film does a great job of giving you insight into the characters lives, and making you genuinely interested in them.  They could have continued to follow these characters for several hours, and I don't feel like I would have ever lost interest.  Natalie Portman, playing the particularly well-written underage love interest, turns in a brilliant performance.  I could certainly see how some people could dislike this film, but anyone with a sensibility and fair understanding of the human condition will enjoy this movie.
0875428940|5.0|and Expert alike!!  This is a great Tarot Deck.  The symbolism and pictures are based on the Rider-Waite, so its easy to use with most books... but the pictures are soooo much prettier.  The images on the cards depict the meaning so well, you almost don't even need a book.  This was the first deck that actually spoke to me... and although I have acquired others I love, I still use this one often.  Some people refer to it as a Pagan deck, but don't let that frighten you if you aren't Pagan.  I find the influences to be very subtle.  I'm not Pagan and use the deck without issue.
1587990717|3.0|I bought FOOLED BY RANDOMNESS after reading the Malcolm Gladwell profile on Nassim Nicholas Taleb in the April issue of the New Yorker.  Like others who have reviewed this book, I found that Gladwell captured the most important details of Taleb's thoughts in a shorter, more entertaining way.  However, I thought that this book can be a worthwhile read for those with a passion for this type of book.<br />FOOLED BY RANDOMNESS is an introduction to the difficulties human beings have at reasoning around probability.  Taleb argues that human beings are genetically hardwired to misattribute the results of human endeavors to skill and knowledge that are, in fact, just coincidental, random events.  Taleb discusses the results of this embedded flaw in human reasoning in three areas.<br />In part 1, Taleb discusses impacts of `rare events' on both financial markets and on human history.  Taleb argues we should beware seemingly successful strategies if they are not proven by the test of history.  In particular, we should examine human history in the long term for general trends and treat skeptically claims that humanity has reached `the end of history' or `a new economic model' where the old, proven rules do not apply.<br />In part 2, Taleb discusses the `survivor effect', or mistaking success based on luck for success based on skill.  In particular, Taleb warns against judging a strategy by its actual results.  Instead, we should judge strategies based upon a sum of all possible outcomes.<br />In part 3, Taleb briefly discusses `tricks' he has developed to try and derail his flawed, ingrained, statistical reasoning and live a rational and, to a great degree, classical life based upon a good understanding of the effect of randomness on our lives.<br />The book is peppered with classical references to ancient philosophers and literature, as well as humorous anecdotes to Taleb's own experience in the world of Wall Street.  Unfortunately, interesting nuggets and provocative thoughts throughout the book are rarely fully explored.  While I was entertained and intrigued, when I got to an end of a chapter or section, I often felt dissatisfied, as if I was trying to wrap my arms around some meaty ideas and came away with empty air.<br />Unlike other reviewers, however, I did not find Taleb particularly pretentious.  In fact, I often felt that Taleb was more than open with his own particular foibles and failings.  His only source of pride seemed to be in realizing that he had these failings.  Ironically, Taleb attributes this understanding to the experiences suffered in his own personal, contingent history.<br />Overall, I found the book to be like a good Chinese dinner: entertaining at the time of reading, but left hungry an hour later.<br />Dav's Rating System:<br />5 stars - Loved it, and kept it on my bookshelf.<br />4 stars - Liked it, and gave it to a friend.<br />3 stars - OK, finished it and gave it to the library.<br />2 stars - Not good, finished it, but felt guilty and/or cheated by it.<br />1 star  - I want my hour back!

B00000JGHM|5.0|Heat stands out as not only one of the five best films of the 1990s, but as one of the best thriller/action movies of all time.  Why?  Let me count the ways.  The apex of the the film is of course, the incredible bank heist and gun battle which follows it.  I have NEVER seen anything like it on film.  The camera work varies at times from hand-held to steady and that gives the entire segment an heir of hyper-reality if you will-as much or even more so than more famous later examples such as 'Saving Private Ryan'.  Michael Mann is one of the best film makers of the modern era, and in my opinion, and the opinion of many others, this is his best film.<br />It's easy to see how a film with both Pacino and De Niro would be great.  But there are many other ways in which this film towers above most others, many of them due to the amazing cinematography work and editing.  Observe Mann's gorgeous use of color and shadow; the blue tint as Pacino is chasing De Niro on the freeway at night, the beautiful balcony scene with Amy Brenneman (who is amazing), the final scene of the film, the color and tone of Pacino's home, the various restaurants etc.  The colors are brilliant-dark is REALLY dark.  Also, the pains that Mann and others have gone to in order to present the most realistic depiction of the crossing of paths and dreams; these are not cardboard characters, these are (mostly) fully fleshed out people with their own fears and goals and greed.  The film retains an undercurrent of menace and fear throughout, and the action is enough for any action film buff.  How nice to see such a well-rounded film these days.<br />As far as the DVD goes, it looks and sounds quite good.  I am not a fan of Warner Bros. DVD work in general-you know they could have put a lot more on the disc than they did.  But what is there is great-three different trailers for the film among other things.  My only complaint is that there seem to be a few scenes in the film that literally look grainy.  I swearI can see the change in the light and color on the screen as a switch is made between film and videotape elements.  I have not heard anyone else mention this.  An avid film viewer such as myself noticed it only after two screenings, so perhaps more casual viewers have not.<br />This is a film that everyone should see at least once, if only to raise the low-brow standards that so many in our culture have embraced.  Essential.
0399226907|4.0|I bought this book for my cousin when she was just 3 and a half.  She loves to see and hear the story of the caterpillar that keeps eating and eating.  She loves the way the caterpillar was so hungry he seems to have eaten right through the pages of the book.<br />That is not just a feature that makes the book one more enjoyable, but helps in cognitive development and the concept of object permanence.  Because she is able to count along with the all of the things the caterpillar eats, and they are always on the page she understands the concept better.<br />Because this is a board book, it is durable enough to handle the abuse that toddlers can put a book through.<br />Why 4 stars?:<br />Eric Carle has created a masterpiece that will last through the generations.  The features of this book cannot be ignored and so, it belongs on the bookshelves of parents and caregivers.
B000003TA4|5.0|This is NO DOUBT the ULTIMATE album... the precedent of many following Rock albums. I have to admit that I did not know any Nirvana songs. The first time that I heard that Nirvana was a good band was when I was at summer camp and some people were talking aobut it. Hey, to me, \\"Nirvana\\" sounds like a grunge band name! I wasn't into that! But \\"hey\\", I said. \\"What the heck, I'll check it out on Amazon.\\"...--> WOW! I lisened to the samples of \\"In Bloom\\" and \\"Come As You Are\\" and I immediatly made the decision that I had to purchase this CD. SOME of the songs, and only some, may be a bit similar to each other, but it is one hell of a compilation! Every single osng on here is uncomprehendably amazing! Jesus, is this good1 I bought this Cd about 6 months ago and it goes into my CD player very, very often. VERY often. Anyway, I am in a rush so I can't do a track run0through, but all I can say s that this is one amazing album!
B00004Y7SF|4.0|Christina Aguierla explodes in this Christmas album with traditional and orginal Christmas pieces.  I will admit she embellishes a little too much with some songs but others, are just perfect.  'Have Yourself a Merry Little Christmas' is not usually a song to be reckoned with but, you would swear she was the first one to record it. Her embellishments are perfect, and does a jazzy version.  Fabulous!  This version should be turned into the classic.<BR>The song that best suits her, and a big buying factor, is 'Merry Christmas, Baby'. Another Ella Fitzgerald like song, it's awsome. Her rendition of O Holy Night is incredible, and shows her indiniable talent.  Even my cousin, who dislikes Christina to all end enjoyed this song. 'Christmas Song' was a great belt out way to start the CD - even her attempt in rapping (which is improving every time she does it).  Definetly speaks about all kids around the world celebrating this Holiday.   I never would have thought that a very Christian song (Angels We Have Heard On High) would sound good with drums and turned into r'b.  Very Ella, and is a treat to the ears.  <BR>The enhanced CD portion is great, too.  And, the CD packaging is extremly inviting, the colours are great and inviting.  This CD is fabulous and will be enjoyed by all, even the (picky) parents and older siblings.
B0000039QA|4.0|Is it possible for one person to have so much flow, skill, and poetic talent that you think you are dreaming? Obviously, yes. Life After Death is yet another example set by The Notorious BIG to lead the rap game. Fluent and smooth, Biggie spits it in our faces, explaining how good he really is and how no one can compare. Sadly enough, that is so terribly true. <br /> ONE MINOR SETBACK(?): No, not a setback, more like a flaw. Wait, not a flaw. Flaw is much too severe of a word. My point is that Ready To Die is a masterpiece. Not many rap CDs can top it. Biggie really is one of the greatest there ever was. Yes, that may be an easy thing to say, but that's just what I believe. Rhymes that you woulden't have rhymed in your dreams he could spit out in a freestyle. So, even though this is not nearly as great as Ready To Die, it is still great. After all, \\"Biggie, Biggie Smalls is the illest...\\"<br />BTW- Definately buy Ready To Die before you buy this, or, buy them both but listen to Ready To Die first.
B00003CXRM|5.0|The Cohen brothers are gaing a reputation as a duo that has a nack for producing films that are both solid and funny.  O' Brother Where Art Thou?, does not fall short st all.  It is a very funny romp and the Acamedy thought so too.  O' Brother Where Art Thou?, was nominated for two Acamedy awards and robbed of both.  It was nominated for Best Screenplay and Best Cinemotography.  <br />The story follows three prisioners that become disenchanted by the daily drudge of crushing rocks on a prision farm in Mississippi, the dapper, silver-tongued Ulysses Everett McGill (George Clooney) heads up the jail break.  The problem is that they are still shackeled together from when they were in a chain gang- bad tempered Pete (John Turturro) and sweet, dim-witted Delmar (Tim Blake Nelson).  With nothing to loose and a buried loot to gain-before it's lost forever in a flood-the three embark on the adventure of a lifetime in this hillariuos offbeat road comedy.  Populated with quirky characters (as seen in the Cohen brothers othe masterpiece Fargo), including a blind prophet, sexy sirens, and a one-eyed Bible salesmen (Johm Goodman), it's an odyssey filled with chases, close calls, near misses, and betrayel that should be missed by anyone.  O' Brother Where Art Thou? will leave you laughing at every outragous and suprising plot twist this film has to offer.
0140386335|5.0|This story is pretty much all about what we imaginative daydreamers thrive off of. The story is about an unheroic boy named Bastian Balthazar Bux who steals and reads a book called \\"The Neverending Story,\\" getting more and more drawn into it as he reads. He soon finds that he is a character in the story and needs to enter the magical land of Fantastica in order to save the land and its Empress. If you have ever found yourself wishing that this kind of thing was real until you almost throw up, then this is definetly the book for you. It was originally written in German, but the translation is very intelligent. It is a good book. READ IT.
B00003CX95|5.0|In the late 13th century, William Wallace (Mel Gibson) returns to Scotland after living away from his homeland for many years. The king of Scotland has died without an heir to the throne and the king of England, a ruthless pagan known as Edward the Longshanks, has seized the throne. Wallace becomes the leader of a ramshackle but courageous army determined to vanquish the greater English forces and restore freedom to Scotland. Wallace's courage and passion unite Scotland in this epic film.<br />In the lat 20th century, Mel Gibson stars on both sides of the camera, playing the lead role plus directing and producing this brawling, richly-detailed saga of fierce combat, tender love, and the will to risk all that is precious for something more precious: freedom. Braveheart is the winner of five Acamedy Awards including Best Picture and Best Director. Braveheart is an outstaning historical drama and one of the most spectacular and entertaining film in years. Braveheart is a movie not to be missed by anyone, which is why I recommend this to everyone.
B000002HHB|5.0|First we have to think about the scenario.  The 10,000 Maniacs were already pretty big with their monstrous hits \\"Because The Night\\" and \\"These Are The Days.\\"  Everyone admired and loved the lead singer Natalie Merchant.  As most hit groups though, there usually is a time when one if not all the members decide to go solo (read: the fugee's). But none have come quite up to par as Natalie Merchant does with TIGERLILY.  A fine mix of Pop, Rock & Folk, Natalie's debut album shows us that she can write and produce anything good!  Maybe you  heard the hits \\"Carnival\\", \\"Wonder\\" and \\"Jealousy\\"on the radio?  Well this CD is chock full of similar-if-not-better overlooked songs.  From the short opening and phenominal number \\"San Andreas Fault\\" (depicting a story of the Earthquakes of CA, desroying hopes and dreams) to the eight *count em, 8!* minute long masterpiece \\"Beloved Wife.\\"  Also the \\"Jealousy\\" version on TIGERLILY is not the same as the one released on the radio, mainly with mostly guitars in the background and not organs (both sound good though).  Overall, TIGERLILY is reccomended to Natalie fans as well as 10,000 Maniacs fans.  This CD is played often at home and I still enjoy it 'till this very day.  It's a classic in the Pop/Rock world!  Overall grade for TIGERLILY: A+(+)
B000001FTD|5.0|Among the Living was the first Anthrax album I ever bought, and it is one of my favorites. Some peolpe might say it's dumb because it has songs about Judge Dredd and Stephen King, but that's part of the fun of this particular thrasher. Every song is cool, and grows on you over time. At first I liked the album, but every time I listen to it I like it more and more. It's really different than any other thrash albums like Reign in Blood or Ride the Lightning, but that's good because that means Anthrax is an original band...which I'm sure you already know if you are reading this. Bottom line: Buy this... album, you won't regret it.
B000001EUL|5.0|This is one of the best albums by the best rock band ever. Maybe the only Scorpions album that doesn't have one single average track, that means no fillers included. It's kind of short, but who cares? All the tracks are great, maybe &quot;coast to coast&quot; and &quot;is there anybody there?&quot; being the best. Both Michael and Mathias do great work. It's hard to find a non-best of album that would have the overall same quality than this record. If you don't like this, I just can't understand you.
6305499365|5.0|One night I was flipping through the TV Channels when I came across the Office Space. I had never heard of it before, but I decided to check it out. It's one of the funniest movies I've seen in a very long time.<br />The opening seen is hilarious. Peter (played by Ron Livingston), who is stuck in a traffic jam finds himself making less forward progress than an old man with a walker. That's the kind of day Peter's day seems to begin every day with something going wrong.<br />From there Peter goes to his job as a computer technological company where he always has issues with the boss and the damn copying machine which never seems to work.<br />When Peter and his friends are frustrated and upset about work their boss says they must have \\"a case of the Mondays.\\" Then they go to the shop next door and order coffee and ask the waitress (played by Diedrich Bader), what she would say if someone told you \\"I think I have the case of the Mondays?\\" The waitresses reply: HILARIOUS!!!<br />Michael Bolton, a friend of Peter's, comes up with a \\"genius\\" plan to make them millionaires in a matter of a few years while screwing their company.<br />Overall this is a great hilarious and humorous movie with great acting (especially Peter and Milton) that will make you laugh.<br />I have seen this movie twice and I love it! This is a great movie rent and watch with your friends or at a party. A Movie you'll want to watch again and again.<br />Every scene in the movie about Milton's \\"red stapler\\" is hilarious.
0385484518|5.0|I really enjoyed reading this book.  i read this book for my sociology class.  Throughout the book it had some very good lessons and some good sayings throughout the book.  This book has taught me a few things and i really enjoyed this book.  This book had me nodding my head the whole time because i agreed on a lot of the things that were mentioned in the book.  This book made me realize that there are people out there that think the same way i do.  This book had a lot of things that people need to understand that don't.
0385503954|5.0|This is a very well-written, indeed it's a beautifully written, book. The language used just keeps you flowing along through the story, which is absorbing in its own right. The book presents a tale of misplaced knowledge, of conclusions reached without sufficient information, and of accusations made which profoundly change the lives of everyone involved. We see guilt, sorrow, venality, heroism, in fact, almost every emotion runs through this book except the one most needed: forgiveness. The author is to be commended for the way in which he presents the events unfolding around the main characters, and the sterling use which he makes of our language, turning the commonplace into something almost profound. You will not be disappointed if you read this work. I predict a literary prize in its future.
B00005YXZH|5.0|Quit grousing, fans of Tweedy old and Tweedy new.  Everyone should be happy.<br />If you wish Jeff could be the guy he was back in 92, you can find him -- just not here.  Tweedy and co. have freed themselves from alt country the same way Bob Dylan and Neil Young freed themselves from 60s folk and 70s folk rock, respectively.  Like Dylan and Young, Wilco's not averse to coming back for a visit - check out the Mermaid Avenue albums - but don't be hurt if it's not where they want to spend the rest of their lives.  If you need some retro-Tweedy - and who doesn't now and then? - go to the Uncle Tupelo page and grab the outstanding &quot;89/93 Anthology,&quot; which even includes some unreleased tracks.  Or listen to Ryan Adams, who's as good at being old-Jeff as anyone.<br />But if you want music by a thorny, cagey, restlessly creative and sometimes difficult band whose top priority is not necessarily making you (or their record label) comfortable, you've come to the right place.  Musical self-emancipation is the least of their accomplishments on this great record.<br />Beginning with a quirky metaphor of interpersonal communication muddled by distance, technology, atmospheric static, emotional dissonance and plain old hard living, the band stretches itself in every direction - lyrically, musically, and sonically.  At the same time, they create beautiful sounds with a rock and roll heart.  Wilco's knack for hooky pop flits through the record like a mischievous ghost: when you think you have a handle on it, it slips away again, then returns with a vengeance, bowls you over with the insanely catchy &quot;Heavy Metal Drummer,&quot; and disappears again.<br />So whether you dig old Jeff or new, count yourself lucky.  If you like both, you are truly blessed.  This is an embarrassment of riches.

B00005JKJA|2.0|I am only rating the DVD itself with the above 2 stars - not the film which I give 5 stars ++++<br /> This DVD (not the actual film!) is a HUGE disappointment. There are no extras other than the trailer for Mulholland Drive. There is a _very_ short cast list with a picture of the featured cast members and their bio & previous works listed.<br /><br /> NO interviews<br /> NO director's commentary - NOTHING!<br /> NO chapter selection!<br /> NO deleted scenes<br /> IT'S ONE BIG CHAPTER!!<br /> I mistakenly turned off my DVD player (instead of pausing) & then  had to very-slowly- use the search->> forward on my remote instead of being able to skip chapters to find where I left off. That was beyond frustrating..<br /> I had expected at least a chapter selection. I had been looking forward to the DVD hoping for some Director's commentary, maybe even the making of, some interviews, deleted scenes & maybe even trailers for other Lynch movies!!! (Wouldn't that have been great?!!) The DVD does offer subtitles/captions available in English, Spanish and French. The 2nd star I threw in is for the interesting leaflet inside the DVD: \\" David Lynch's 10 clues to unlocking this thriller.\\" The picture itself is pretty good and so is the sound. Still the overall the DVD lack of features are a huge disappointment. I was too eager to purchase this DVD and should have waited for a special edition.<br /> To me this film was the most emotionally engrossing and powerful of all of David Lynch's works. The scene that affected me the most and continues to stick in my mind is the Silencio sequence, which had me in tears. The intensity of Mulholland Drive had me on the edge throughout the film. Mulholland Drive is very complex, emotional, ironic, tragic, cruel, eerie and hauntingly beautiful.<br /> This film is not as straight forward as some of David Lynch's other projects (Blue Velvet etc). The twists and turns and sudden switches between reality and illusion only add to the film's & Director's merits in my opinion. Not that any Lynch films are (meant to be?) very straight forward. You'd never hear someone watch a Lynch film and exclaim at the end \\"That all made perfect sense!\\".. Perhaps Lynch films are never meant to be 'understood' but only enjoyed in all their outrageousness and hilarity. (Take \\"Wild At Heart\\" for example.) Mulholland Drive's ending is a bizarre free-for-all that I was unable to piece together. I was still left with some unanswered questions. This didn't disappoint me, rather every time I watch it I find something new. And that only adds to the  intrigue and encourages me to watch the film again and again.<br /> Summing it up, another reviewer *Kaleido Logic* so  eloquently wrote:<br />  \\"I could probably come to some conclusion about the meaning of it all, but everyone should come up with  their own. And that is why Lynch is such an essential filmmaker, no one will ever do it like he does, and no  one ever has. People can debate the meaning of his films for all of eternity and never agree, and that alone  makes this film a worthwhile entry in the Lynch legacy.\\"<br /> The acting is flawless and very impressive.  Laura Harring is heartbreakingly beautiful! She perfectly conveys the helplessness, desperation and terror felt being held captive by her own failed memory. She is absolutely yummy! I am still awestruck with Naomi Watt's dynamic performance as Betty / Diane Selwyn.  Her character reveals her complexities slowly and enticingly. First the naive small town girl, secondly the heated seductress (WOW) during her audition and then her unabashed courage and determination to solve the puzzle of Rita's true identity and finally as tortured and vengeful Diane. I recommend this movie to absolutely any David Lynch fan or person who appreciates a mystery that takes you on a stormy ride<br /> People not accustomed to David Lynch's work might find this film difficult to follow, confusing and maybe difficult to understand. ( I won't be recommending it to my Grandparents any time soon).. I imagine anyone experiencing David Lynch's work for the first time through this film will either love it or hate it. People do tend to have very strong reactions one way or another to David Lynch's work.<br /> Any Twin Peaks fan should find this right up their alley (even if they did not like any of Lynch's work other than the Twin Peaks series). Not that I can imagine not liking any of Lynch's work!!<br />Again my rating of 2 stars is just for my absolute disappointment in the lack of extras on the DVD edition, not the film itself.ing it to my Grandparents any time soon)..

B00004W50T|5.0|\\"Tears of Rage\\" sounded like nothing I had heard before. The guitar (run through the rotating Leslie speaker) - at the time I had no idea what instrument it was, only that it was gorgeous. The wailing Hammond organ sounded more than a bit like church/synagogue. And Dylan's trademark mixed metaphors chiming in our ears, relaxing/teasing our minds, delighting and instructing us like never before - because the sound was unprecedented, yet was simultaneously so rootsy.<br />It was like the ultimate counterculture sermon, really - this entire album. It was really nice to get it in an altogether new style - after previous largely effective efforts by the Jefferson Airplane (psychedelic), Procol Harum (baroque-rock), and of course the Beatles, among others.<br />This was a cannon shot - not just in its imaginative re-creation of rock. There's almost too MUCH hyperbole to latch onto in attempting to describe the effect and the reality of this album as a whole, back in '68-'69.<br />\\"To Kingdom Come\\". The scripture lesson - allegorical, but also crazily hilarious, and imaginative in how it mixes all this - along with emotions of pathos, warning exhortations and the like. The way the lead singer bestows these varied emotions upon/into his melody-line is almost beyond belief. Holy smoke, folks!<br />\\"In a Station\\" - possibly the most sublimely beautiful poetic ballad of the rock era to date, though the Band themselves equaled it later with \\"Whispering Pines\\" (from the 'Brown Album'). Musically, it begins by treading in the tracks of \\"Tears of Rage\\", but ever so (s)lightly before it heads off in its own cloud, as it were.<br />\\"Caledonia Mission\\" takes off from \\"To Kingdom Come\\", but once again this is no re-tread. Even more humorous than \\"Kingdom\\", it enters somewhat into the iconic regions of Country Joe and the Fish's \\"Not So Sweet Martha Lorraine\\" but with totally different intent and result. More great rock allegory / personal introspection for the ages, as good as or better than Dylan's sometimes awesome contemporaneous efforts on 'John Wesley Harding\\".<br />\\"The Weight\\" continues the story, and gets down with some unbelievably soulful playing and singing. It actually sounds better after all these years than it did in its remarkable heyday.<br />And folks, this is just (what used to be) \\"SIDE 1\\" on the original LP. Every song here and on \\"SIDE 2\\" is like a novel/noel - or a gospel unto itself [in miniature]. Who can forget the ground-shattering and unmatchable sounds of \\"Chest Fever\\" and \\"This Wheels on Fire\\", and the searing/serene anthem \\"I Shall Be Released\\". Then there is the haunting rootsiness of \\"Long Black Veil\\", the near-paralyzing compassion of \\"Lonesome Susie\\", and the blazingly inspirational, psycho-spiritual healing \\"We Can Talk\\".<br />There's way more emotion in each and every song than you can shake a cross at.tter than Dylan's sometimes awesome contemporaneous efforts on 'John Wesley Harding\\".<br />\\"The Weight\\" continues the story, and gets down with some unbelievably soulful playing and singing.

0345350499|5.0|The Arthurian theme has been done before, and I thought it had been exhausted until I read this book.  Taking a viewpoint which had really not been much expored-- the female viewpoint-- and bringing the mythos to a more personal level, MZB created a tale of remarkable depth and power.  Morgaine is presented as a wholly human character, not a caricature of evil, and Gwynhwyfar is treated to a warts-and-all portrait.  One aspect of this book that had been glossed over in other versions is the atmosphere of a time when two religions struggled for dominance, including a (not very flattering) cameo appearance by St. Patrick himself.  This religious turmoil is symbolized by Morgaine, the priestess of the old ways of magic and celebration of life, and by Gwynhwyfar, the fanatic product of a convent upbringing whose fears, guilt-feelings and repressed self-loathing are surpassed only by her intolerence for any beliefs not her own.  Also interesting to note is that Merlin is not a person, but a title, inherited by very different men.  The book never gets lost in unnecessary detail for all its length, and the wealth of information about medieval life is well worth the read.  You will be sorry when it's over and will want to read it again and again.
B00005JKDR|4.0|We really enjoyed this film, as a family. What I noticed in the<BR>film was the name Ray Harryhousen. My mother went to school with<BR>him in Los Angeles and was a friend of his.

0440219078|5.0|this is a great book with tons of adventure and stuff like <br />that.  it may seem a little weird and stupid at first but in <br />the end it is a great book. Read it!!...
B00005JKED|5.0|If you aren't into violence or profanity I would recommend you look for something else. In my opinion this movie was awesome and well made. Of course, it can get your blood boiling and it does keep you on the edge of your seat at times. Its just a &quot;Wow&quot; movie in my book. This is Denzel's best performance. It nice to see him in a different role and away from the goody two shoes man.
B00005JKJA|4.0|Mulholland Drive is a dark treatise on Hollywood. David Lynch's renown as an unorthodox artist and the pressure he has felt to make conventional films is vividly at play here in the subtext to the film's twisting narrative. He deliciously explores this theme through the film's characters, one of whom is a film director who is forced to relinquish control of casting his female lead.<br />The two female characters are designed as metaphors for the loss of one's identity in tinsel town. Betty, a newly arrived, wide-eyed innocent girl from Canada comes to LA to seek her destiny in motion pictures. Her career plans are put on hold when she meets a woman who calls herself Rita and shows up in Betty's shower. But Rita is unsure of exactly who she is as she has just been involved in a car accident, and is suffering from amnesia. Betty undergoes an amazing, but brief transformation, in a sexy audition piece and Rita finds out the grisly fate of a friend of hers named Diane. These episodes are but a foreshadowing of the twists yet to come as Betty and Rita's lives become increasingly intertwined. The final mystery is unveiled in a cacophony of bizarre dreamlike imagery that includes a trip to a nightclub where reality is just an illusion, a homeless man with a blue box and little people inside it, and two lesbian love scenes.<br />Undoubtedly, there will be many people who dislike this film. It's non-linear, dreamlike narrative is just too difficult for most mainstream audiences. But that is precisely why David Lynch fans and non-fans alike should give Mulholland Drive another look. How many DVDs have you bought, thinking you would watch them dozens of times, only to have them collect dust on the shelf? Mulholland Drive is one of those haunting, eerie, masterpieces that demand multiple viewing. Even when you've unraveled the obscure plot, you will watch this film again and again as Lynch's mystery of mixed identities envelops you in a myriad of sensations. Mulholland Drive isall at once, foreboding, mysterious, frightening and beautiful. <br />The one and only reason I gave this four stars instead of five has to do with the DVD itself, not the movie. There are practically no extras on this disc, not even chapter stops. And if ever a movie demanded audio commentary from its director, it's this one. My suspicion is that Universal is planning a \\"special\\" edition of Mulholland Drive with these bonuses. Quite frankly, I'm sick of these marketing tactics to get us poor suckers to buy multiple copies of the same film. But the movie itself is the best frill on this no-frills package. Buy it, and rent the special edition when it comes out.
B000065U1N|1.0|It's really a shame that such a fantastic director (Aliens, Bladerunner, Gladiator) had to resort to a racist and boring mis-adventure.  Under the guise of saving Somalis from famine (though the worst of it was already over), U.S. troops got into trouble.  In the process, they killed thousands of Somalis... In the movie, each American life is precious and each Somali life is worthless.  The movie is nearly plotless; American soldiers shooting like crazy at Africans who don't want them there.  Fans of the book will be disappointed that Ridley Scott has stripped the movie of any complexity, doubt, or sophistication.  For 2 hours, it's just 'kill the Black people.'
B00003CX5P|3.0|A long time ago,in a film studio far far away...George Lucas began a franchise. The original Star Wars ( now Episode 4 ),relied on an actual story,that was accentuated by \\"special effects\\". After seeing \\"The Phantom Menace\\",you will find yourself wanting of those simpler times. Frankly,they spent too much time on trying to WOW everybody with computer imagery,and they forgot to write an actual story,that mattered! Ewan McGregor and Natalie Portman both give good performances,now if they only had a film to use them in! The film worries more about showing us all these \\"really cool aliens\\",and all these \\"really cool planets and space ships\\",than advancing the story. What purpose did the Pod Race serve? The Underwater Kingdom? Did we need the stereo type characters? ( not only is there Stephen Fetchit...er...Jar Jar Binks,we have the anti-semetic Watto the pawnbroker,and let's not forget the overly Asian aliens at the begining of the film.) What were THEY thinking?? Is it any wonder that Darth Maul stood out? He was the only interesting character! ( Okay,Samuel L.Jackson as Mace Windu is good too...but that's a given.). A lame Episode 1,with a lotta explaining to do!<br />The film itself is only worthy of 1 star. But the 2nd Disc full of nifty extras,bumps it up to a 3 star deal!
B00005OMTT|5.0|Cretu and company never cease to amaze ! Unstifled by trends, unresricted by gimmicks, Enigma like composer New Age guru Vangelis are in charge of their own musical artistry;There are no compromises. Enigma dares to go where other artists fear to tread. So what if they use samples or loops or too many synthesizers; At least Cretu knows how to use them and not abuse them. Wife Sandra is still in top form with her sensual beckoning voice of passion (or lust ?). This collection has much more to offer other than just atmospheric music. The rich sonic overlapping textures and deep percussion beats on some tracks make for a healthy mental trip that transcends all time and space. The musical or transitional segues that link all songs like one musical suite or landscape can only be described as true Enigma style...
B00005JKJA|5.0|A lot of reviewers put this film on their \\"Best of 2001\\" list,and with very good reason. Although the story and plot get really twisty,and occaissionally defy their own parameters,I think the critics just loved the performances so much,the rest could be overlooked! Yes,it's definitely a David Lynch film,but it's definitely a whole different animal. Laura Elena Harring,Naomi Watts, and Justin Theroux,all put in top notch performance in a tale of Amnesia,Murder,Blackmail,Hollywood,and a Lynch favourite: Duality. What is real and what is imagined? What do you see? Lynch supplies several clues in the DVD insert...good luck. I think what makes this film such a paradox,and hard to pin down,is it's history. \\"Mulholland Drive\\" was originally a television pilot,and it didn't get bought. That is why the film introduces numerous characters and sub-plots that don't get fully realized in the full length film.( He later brought back Harring & Watts to shoot additional footage,for the theatrical version.) I give Lynch a lot of credit for making the effort,and creating this odd and amusing little creature,it's fun & quirky,and you'll think about it. With a supporting cast featuring Michael J.Anderson,Ann Miller,and Billy Ray Cyrus as the Pool Guy,how could you not enjoy it?
0446608955|5.0|I just finished the book two days ago, and it only took me a day and a half. But I LOVED IT!!!!! Usually I don't read romance novels, but this, if you really read it properly, isn't only that. It is a very thought-provoking book, and it makes you think about yourself and how lucky you are to have the people you do. I just lent it to someone, and I am dying to get it back to read it again!!! It is THE most AMAZING BOOK EVER WRITTEN!!! I liked it even more than Harry Potter (considering they were both different kinds of books)...BUT SERIOUSLY GO BUY IT PEOPLE!!! I only heard about it when the movie came out, but I wish I had read it earlier...NOW I AM DYING TO SEE THE MOVIE!!!<BR>GO BUY IT PPL GO!!! GET UR WALLET AND GO!!! IT DESERVES MORE THAN 5 stars!!!
B0000256KE|5.0|I used to be a moderate Roxy Music fan.  I had Avalon, Siren, and Flesh and Blood, as well as Bete Noire (Ferry solo) and liked the mellow feel of the music.  Kind of late night, atmospheric music.  And then...<BR>I saw Rolling Stone list &quot;For Your Pleasure&quot; as one of the 50 coolest albums, so I picked it up.  From the start with &quot;Do the Strand&quot; it blew me away.  This is a Roxy Music I had never heard before.  It really rocks in places, is experimental, and always musical.  Kinda like Ziggy Stardust meets Peter Gabriel (in the old Genesis days).  This one is much better than the Roxy Music albums I mentioned above.  <br />In a way it's too bad, since listening to this CD has ruined my enjoyment of the others.  This is just so much better, the others seem kind of flat in comparison.  Too bad Eno left.  (although I am grateful for his work with Bowie, Talking Heads, PG and others...also his solo &quot;Another Green World&quot; is worth checking out), but it is not as good as his work on &quot;For Your Pleasure&quot;.  <br />Great CD (and definitely one of the 50 coolest)
B00002E224|5.0|First of all there is nothing fake in this movie, that why I loved it.<BR>Real feeling, real development of story and real people.<BR>I saw it 3 days ago and still under strong impression...<BR>It reminded me how much I miss non-comercialized life.<BR>Everything was great - script,acting,directing,music...<BR>Got to see it.
6304708521|3.0|Even for die hard Beatles fans, MAGICAL MYSTERY TOUR is very hard to watch. LET IT BE is way easier to watch than this.  It is very disjointed and confusing.  When it was first aired on the BBC, it was shown in black and white so, it must have been even worse for the tele audience.  It's great to see the four Beatles together, however, apart from the musical sequences, there isn't much here. The bus tour isn't very interesting, the other characters besides the Beatles are repulsive, and there really isn't a story or plot.  In the BEATLES ANTHOLOGY, Paul McCartney mentions that film students, who went on to become some of the top directors in the industry, took great notice of this film...I  don't think so. Luckily, A HARD DAY'S NIGHT and HELP! are out there to help people forget about one of the Beatles' flops!!
B00005YW4H|5.0|Just exquisite, Norah's voicings and piano touch!! You'll love the variety of her writing (a little country, jazz and blues) and you'll appreciate her unwillingness to be commercial and a passing fad. Her sound is timeless and a little reminiscent of Lady Day.
B00005JKL8|4.0|What Hollywood does best-a big, rollicking ride that works if you don't look too much deeper than the surface.  Some interesting cinematography (with an obvious influence from _Saving Private Ryan_, esp. apparent when Serbians unload on Burnett/Owen Wilson after he sees them shoot his pilot & in some of more extreme violence; check out extra scenes for more of that, since was toned down a bit to achieve PG-13 rating) and excellent special effects (to whit, SAM chase scene).  Wilson shows some breadth here by playing an uncharacteristic (up to this point) role of action hero:  although his portrayal has an everyman quality that separates it from the typical straight testosterone variety (which is a GOOD  thing!).  DVD's extras don't add much except a great picture (extra scenes & commentary pretty standard, & dull, fare).  B+
B00005Y7AW|4.0|I did a quick search through the reviews and was surprised that no one mentioned how much RW sounds like Harry Nilsson, the brilliant songwriter of the sixties and seventies whom the Beatles once called their favorite band. (Nilsson and Lennon would later become great friends and drinking buddies.) Nilsson, who died of heart failure in 1994, was responsible for such classics as &quot;The Coconut Song,&quot; &quot;Everybody's Talking&quot; (the theme song to Midnight Cowboy) and &quot;One&quot; (covered by Aimee Mann, it would become the theme song to Magnolia.)<br />If there's any justice, you already know all this and you're annoyed by this little lesson.<br />Poses, and especially songs like &quot;Cigarettes and Chocolate Milk&quot; and &quot;Greek Song,&quot; share all the elements of the best Harry Nilsson performances: the plaintive and beautiful voice, the bittersweet nostalgia of a dancehall piano, the charming sense of humor. If you're a Nilsson fan, you should check this album out. And if you love this album, try Nilsson's Nilsson Schmilsson or The Point. If you don't like either, well, I'm not sure we have anything to say to each other.
B000000H4A|5.0|I just love this album.  I heard \\"Halloween\\" on ZROCK many years ago and couldn't believe someone was this extreme with his voice and satanic with his image.  I was immediately hooked and had to find out more (not to mention hear more) from this artist.  I can't understand why some people can't understand that this is one of King Diamond's best records?!  Let me clarify.  This is not IN ANY WAY a moderate effort.  I do like Abigail as a whole just oh so very SLIGHTLY better but, Fatal Portrait with the songs \\"Haunted\\", \\"The Jonah\\", \\"The Portrait\\" and \\"Lurking in the Dark\\" just wipes the floor with almost anything I've heard from anyone.  Fatal Portrait also contains the song \\"Charon\\" which just plain jams!  It is my favorite KD song.  Haa I used to highly anticipate side two of the tape because \\"Charon\\" started it out.  If you're wondering about King Diamond (and you probably are since you're reading this) you probably already know about the extremeniss of his voice and are not bothered by it, check out Fatal Portrait and the equally powerful Abigail.  You won't be disappointed.  And if you really like powerful and heavy check out what should be your new favorite album, Testament ~ The Gathering ;)  Tell everyone!
0679601686|5.0|This is my favorite book ever. I have read it many times, four to be exact. Jane Austen is so witty and does a great job at telling this love story. As you read you begin to really know the characters. You begin to relate to their fears and desires. It takes great story telling to bring characters to life. Every lady who reads this book will dream of their Darcy...will wish that they were Elizabeth. No one can escape the enchantment of PRIDE AND PREJUDICE.
B000060OWV|4.0|Having read many great reviews of the bluesmen past efforts I decided to give this CD a try. What a great disc! Besides being an unbelievable guitar player, Ford's songs are well written with great lyrics. His one instrumental track on the cd &quot;Indianola&quot; is a great rock-blues instrumental. You can't help but tap your toes to this track. His vocals on the rest of the tracks are heart felt and well done especially on &quot;My Everything&quot; and &quot;Make Me Your Only One&quot;. If you're looking for a quality Blues disc with great guitar playing and good vocals, you have to add this to your blues collection!
B00000JZC4|5.0|One of my top 20 records of all time (I am 22, and own 300 plus cd's).  Richard Patrick can now sing ladies and gentlemen.  Not only does he sing, he soars. More importantly, the \\"sameness\\" that made Shortbus feel like you were riding one, is totally gone!  I was hesitant to buy it(a few years ago now...)It took a few spins for me to appreciate this record though.  Filter can now be declaired a seperate entity from Nine Inch Nails as well.  \\"Welcome to the Fold\\" and \\"Its Gonna Kill me\\" are pleasent reminders that Filter can rock as hard as ever, but what makes this cd complete are the haunting industrial tracks(\\"Cancer\\" and \\"Miss Blue\\") and the moving but radio friendly balladry \\"Take a Picture\\".  Middle of the road rock songs such as \\"Captain Bligh\\" and \\"The Best things\\" flash off some clever lyrics in place of a highly unique sound of other songs and are very catchy.  As of now this album is platinum plus in sales and one can only hope Filters next album, \\"The Amalgamut\\" can match or improove upon the near perfection of this album.
B00004YYDI|5.0|I thought the edited version was good...<br />I can't believe how much cool stuff was cut out.  This extended version is so much better than the edited version, it's not even funny.  The story line flows alot smoother and you get a better feel for who the characters are.  <br />I highly recommend this version over the edited version.  In my humble opinion it's worth the extra expense.  This is now one of the prize DVD's in my collection.
0440234743|4.0|John Grisham's book The Testament is a fine novel. Its well defined characters and fast moving plot make it an instant favorite for anyone who enjoys reading. From the scheming ways of a lousy father to the selflessness of his missionary daughter this book is a great read. The settings change rapidly but with good cause and the multitude of circling lawyers changes direction in the blink of an eye making this book one to watch out for.
B000003TAW|5.0|just buy it.  believe me.  you must buy it.  just buy the cd.  do it.  you know you want to.  ooh, the blue album.  how i love thee.  JUST BUY THE CD! *ahem* ...you'll thank me later.
B00005JKEC|5.0|Denzel Washington! He's so talented that he can go against the grain, against the type casting, and make you believe that he's bad. And let me quote from the movie \\"see that? that's sexy!\\"
6300151425|5.0|This VHS contains the making-of documentary of Jim Henson Labyrinth. Includes interviews of Jim Heson, David Bowie(Who play Jareth, the evil Goblin King), Jennifer Connely(who play Sarah, a girl that wishes her baby brother away by the goblins) and a lot more. I like to see how the characters of the movie take physical form in the hands of henson puppet crew. And the election of David Bowie to play the Goblin King were perfect.
6305508550|5.0|Umm... yeah... I'm gonna have to go ahead and say this movie gets better everytime I watch it.   A great movie, with a great ending.  If you've never seen it, its a safe bet to buy this movie.  If you have seen it, than you know it's a good movie!
B000002HPV|5.0|Buy it.  Don't think just buy it.  Listen to it, and if you don't get it keep playing it.  Bjork said once that it's easy to write mad angry depressing songs, but difficult to write and convey true happiness.  Not the smiley joke kind, but the \\"I'm so in love I can't stand it\\" kind, the kind that makes you feel like you're going to explode.  And she does it better than any one on the planet.  We are truly lucky to have her alive during our life time.  Her music is timeless and the beauty with in is impossible to describe.  I am in awe!

B000053VAF|5.0|Kevin Smith is no doubt a brilliant writer, and even though his directing skills could use some polish, Dogma is a step above his other films (well, except Chasing Amy).  The storyline is one of those that you have to pay a lot of attention to though; Linda Fiorentino stars as a Catholic woman that works in an abortion clinic and is more and more losing her faith.  One night she is visted by \\"The Voice of God\\" (Alan Rickman) and given an assignment to stop two banished angels (Ben Affleck and Matt Damon) from re-entering heaven through a loophole in the Catholic Dogma, and will thus destroy all existence.  She is teamed up with good ol' Jay & Silent Bob (Jason Mewes and Smith), the unknown 13th Apostle (Chris Rock) and a rather sexy muse who works in a strip club (Salma Hayek who steals the entire movie).  Jason Lee is fantastic as the horned Azrael who has a few tricks up his own sleeve, and George Carlin is funny as Cardinal Glick.  But what makes Dogma work is that there is a lot of truth about religion that is discussed and joked about in the movie, mainly Salma Hayek's character talking about what is right and wrong about organized religion, and Matt Damon convincing a nun to quit her faith are some brilliant dialogue that will make the viewer think if he has an open mind.  All in all, Dogma isn't really as controversial as some say it is, but those with unique tastes will enjoy.
0064407667|4.0|There is a great deal to like about this book. Its writing style is very fluid and well done as well as being imaginative. The author explains the use of a lot of interesting words. It makes the kids think about things  and is teaching them as well. <BR>The book does appear to be despressing, but you have to look deeper to see what is really going on. The children are always battling to overcome problems that stand in their way, and they never give up and never surrender. <BR>The subject matter is at times a little extreme for young readers, but as always I suggest you read it first and then judge for yourself if you think it is appropriate. <BR>Excellent value and a good read.
B000001DTM|5.0|If I could, you know I would give this album 10 stars. Achtung Baby is U2's new album of a new decade. U2 had been wanting change. Bono at the last night of the decade, and the last concert of the Love Town tour, said to the people in the concert audience and millions around the world: \\"This is the end of something for U2. It's no big deal, we just need to go away and dream it all up again...\\" <br />And I have to say, that's exactly what they did. Achtung Baby is an album with U2 sounding just fantastic. In my opinion, next to The Joshua Tree, at their finest. They've changed their appearance but didn't lose any of their honesty. U2's renewed confidence in their music is astounding. Bono's voice sounds AMAZING and his lyrics give me chills. The album was recorded partly in Hansa Studios in Berlin and in Dublin. It was produced by Brian Eno and Daniel Lanois, who also produced The Joshua Tree and The Unforgettable Fire.<br />Achtung Baby is just an amazing album. It's powerful, emotional, and grand. There is really no way to describe Achtung Baby without feeling (or I should say, listening to) it for yourself. Buy this CD as a first if you're a new fan of U2 because it just rocks. Period.
038533558X|5.0|Will hasn't seen his brother Ken for 12 years.  After being accused of raping and killing a neighborhood girl, he simply vanished, leaving his family to pick up the shattered pieces left in his wake.  Clues left at the crime scene leave the family to wonder if Ken himself was also a victim that night.  But now with the death of his Mother, Will is left with only her final words, \\"Your brother is still alive.\\"  And when Sheila, the love of his life disappears, Will is more determined than ever to find answers   Because not only was the murdered girl a neighbor, she was also Will's first love.  The deeper Will looks, the more he discovers facts that he would rather not know.  How well does one really know those he loves?  Is everything connected, or just random circumstance?   As the mystery deepens, Will must face the truth, and the danger, that surrounds these questions and more.        <br />This is easily the first perfect mystery of the year.  Coben  doesn't miss a beat, and there's not a single miss-step in the entire novel.  Combining unbridled suspense, and heart-wrenching emotion, Coben has written his best book yet.  The reader will be torn between reading as quickly as possible in order to unravel the hidden mystery, and reading as slowly as possible in order to savor each beautifully rendered word.  Each character comes alive under Coben's more than capable hand, leaving the reader emotionally spent , yet craving more, chapter after chapter.  Do what you must to get your hands on this book, you won't regret it.  Just make sure you start it at a time you can finish it, because it's almost impossible to put down.   My only complaint, and it's a sad one, is that Mr. Coben has now set an almost impossibly high standard for others to achieve in mystery writing, one that other authors after this will undoubtedly have a hard time living up to.  But don't let this stop you from reading this intelligent and moving thriller.  It's an experience not to be missed!
B00000J6AG|4.0|With his 1999 album, Play, Moby proves himself an expert musical chemist. A cornucopia of styles are processed into the New York City DJ's samplers and synthesizers and some of the most unlikely pairings surface. Techno beats mix with rich, folky earthiness (\\"Everflowing\\"). Gospel vocals mix with Brian Eno-ish effects (\\"Natural Blues\\"). Punk rock ferocity mixes with progrock keyboard-gloss (\\"Machete\\"). Trip-hop smoothness mixes with singer-songwriter reflections (\\"Porcelain\\"). And hard rock surrealism mixes with dance music bleeps and buzzes (\\"Southside\\"). Unlike contemporaries, such as Fatboy Slim and Basement Jaxx, Moby's mergers never come across as smirky or slapstick. He merely isolates what precisely makes each genre sound mournful, serene, intense or what makes about each genus makes a listenor get-up and dance and combines them with the appropriate aspects from another genre, resulting with tracks that resonate in said atmosphere. If one could earn a PHD in pop music amalgamation, Play would act as a fine thesis.
B00003CXXS|4.0|Jurassic Park 3 is a lot of things that part 2 could have been and wasn't.  Gone are the overbloated casts, the nightime, rainy, dark look and feel.  Back in a big way are the dinosaurs, the wild environments, and a handful of likeable people that you root for to get through it all.  <BR>Maybe that was the biggest problem with part 2, we didn't like the characters in the story, so we didn't care if they made it or not.<BR>This is an enjoyable thrill ride that improves with additional viewings.  It still not as replayable as Jurassic Park, but it's a very watchable film.  While not flawless, I would recommend this to anyone who enjoys the premise but might have been dissappointed in the sequel.
6305176299|5.0|Jan DeBont's first film as director is one of the greatest action films of the 90's. Starring Keanu Reeves, Sandra Bullock, Dennis Hopper and Jeff Daniels, Speed is an adrenalin-pumping movie that is essentially one big extended action scene. Throughout the film's running time the pace never lets up, creating suspense- filled action and excitement. The premise of the action makes for one far-fetched but fun thrill ride.<br />Keanu is the quintessential cool guy action hero Jack Traven who, along with Annie Porter (Bullock) tries not to get blown up by a bomb that retired cop Howard Payne (Hopper) has set on the bus to get money. The entire principal cast are great, especially Hopper, whose character is reminiscent of his crazy bad guy in Red Rock West (1992). With lines like \\"Poor people are crazy Jack, I'm eccentric\\", Hopper manages to give a good performance during his rather short screen time. Plus the added quality of the always-good Daniels is first-rate. And Keanu, now best known for The Matrix, is equally cool here.<br />Jan DeBont's direction makes the film a taut, entertaining action ride, and surprisingly, Bullock manages to change from nervy bus passenger to a strong character by the film's conclusion. And the film's musical score creates even more tension and excitement. But the film is not perfect, it's predictable and things get rather monotonous at the end, with yet another gasping of \\"The track's not finished!\\" Minor quibbles aside, the action is impressive, and Jan DeBont's visual stylishness gives a really eye-catching look. This action-fest is one of the best. The extras are a real downer, with only a trailer.
B00004Z459|5.0|One of the most godly CDs one can buy. Linkin Park brings to you a completely amazing album. The reason why it's so damn good, is because the majority of the tracks could be deemed a single. Chester Bennington has such a melodic voice, much like Keenan James Maynard of TOOL and A Perfect Circle, which goes well with the rhymin' raps of emcee Mike Shinoda. DJ Mr. (Joe) Hahn is known to be one of the best scratchers out there. And of course, you can't have the rock in the band without guitarist Brad Delson and drummer Rob Bourdon. If you already have this CD, you'll be yearning for more Linkin Park. Download these songs to soothe your needs until their next CD comes out:<br />1. My December<BR>2. High Voltage<BR>3. The Morning After (Not on CD and acoustic track by Chester)<BR>4. And One<BR>5. Carousel<BR>6. Esaúl (Original version of &quot;A Place For My Head&quot;)<BR>7. Part of Me<BR>8. Step Up<BR>9. Technique<br />Those tracks are off their first CD, Hybrid Theory EP, which isn't sold anymore (Because they were using the band name &quot;Hybrid Theory&quot;, which was currently being used, thus came this CD's name). If you still need more, I suggest buying the Queen of the Damned album. It has the song &quot;System&quot;, which is performed by Chester Bennington, and written by Jonathan Davis of Korn. This band deserves 5 stars for its originality alone. This band is currently my favorite, and will most likely be until the band's demise.
B000002IAZ|4.0|I wasn't a Springfield fan when they were together,except for liking \\"For What It's Worth.\\" I became aware of the Buffalo's other work only after becoming a fan of Crosby, Stills, Nash and Young. I bought a cassette copy of Retrospective back when it first came out, and was not greatly impressed. About five years ago, I found another copy in a bargan bin and couldn't resist it for the price.Somehow, at age 57, NOW their stuff really pleases me. I listened to this two or three times a month for the first year, and two or three times a year ever since. It seems to get better and better, and I hear different things within with each listen. This album, as other reviewers say, may not be as good as their three original records. I haven't heard those. But it is good enough for me. Springfield is not quite as strong as CSN and Y at their peak, but the selections on this collection hold up very well considering the passage of the decades. Lots of people credit Gram Parsons with the big move of rock into country, but this album is much more fun to hear than the double-lp Parsons' CD you can buy now. Springfield, for my money, is hugely more enjoyable than the Byrds. While Richie Furay's solo career never happened at all, and Stephen Stills' solo work faded into oblivion quickly (am I the only one willing to admit I bought \\"Manassas\\"?), Neil Young, of course, became...Neil Young. Even so, half of Neil's albums are [bad]. The other half are brilliant. There is nothing [bad] about these dozen Buffalo Springfield gems. Had I paid full price for my copy, maybe I would not be so delighted, but if you can afford it, and like the CSN and Y/Beatles sound, buy this. Don't judge it by only one hearing. Live with it awhile. I think you'll like it.
B00004XQ83|5.0|I think I read in the jacket of this cd that you won't find these songs played on a country western radio station, and maybe that's why I like it.  I usually don't like country music, but I love this album.  It is fun and folksie and guaranteed to have you singing along!
B00005JKL8|5.0|i expected just another boring action flick instead i got much more.it really made me think about the important things in life and what freindship really means. owen wilson gives another great performance. although not as good as in zoolander. gene hackman is great as usual. a plot with twists and turns like none other. great dvd extras. defenetly the best and most emotional action movie i have ever seen!! after watching it i was a better person. buy it
0684833395|5.0|The words I used to describe Catch-22 are bleak, black, and absurd. Heller's brand of absurdist humor creates some of the most poignant moments in literature and some of the most hilarious (there are many, many laugh out loud places here). It is basically the story of Yossarian, a bomber, in the closing months of World War II. He can't understand why thousands of people he hasn't met yet are trying to kill him. And it goes from there. Loaded with absurdist humor. It does turn darker towards the end. This is a very densely packed book, every page loaded with information. It's not a book you can lose concentration while reading. But it is well worth the time and energy it takes to read it. Definitely one of the best books ever written.
B000005S6B|5.0|A friend back in San Diego introduced me to the Pogues music about five years ago and this was the album that made me a fan.<BR>Straightaway, a sonic riot comes at you with a relentless energy. You can just picture this scene in a pub: fists and chairs flying, glasses breaking, and pool cues swinging while Shane MacGowan and Company are on stage lustily urging every one on.<BR>My favorites are the manic title cut and the even more maniacal Fiesta. Pour in the bittersweet Fairytale of New York, stir in the strident and pointed anti-British politics of Medley and Streets of Sorrow/Birmingham Six, then shake in the majesty of The Broad Majestic Shannon and you have yourself one heady brew of a CD. The rest of the songs add the necessary froth.<BR>Since I had worn my cassette out, I am very happy to have found this CD here. I heartily recommend this to anyone who likes quality, high-energy music with an Irish edge.
B0000214F0|4.0|I have to say that Caligula may somewhat be shocking for it's explicit and sexual content and details of torture of people and animals, however I found the movie to be an outstanding film. It's integrity takes you to another level where the past of the Roman days comes alive.  Sex was truly exploited then and almost everything and anything was quite normal.  Malcolm McDowell did a brilliant work as Caligula.  It's the best adult film of all time.  It's the most memorable late 70's film and it's sad how Hollywood doesn't make great movies like the ol' classics.  A must see!!
B00004XPP0|5.0|The Star Wars Trilogy features some of the most recognizable characters in film history. The story of Star Wars is universally known and celebrated. The films play out like Space Opera Saturday Matinee Serials. Each film is meant to be viewed as part of a whole story, and be seen as one film. The films feature astonishing special effects for the time they were made. Take, for instance, in The Empire Strikes Back the amazing Hoth AT-AT walker attack scene. Or the attacks on the two Death Stars in A New Hope and in Return Of The Jedi. <br />The story of the trilogy is quite original and interesting. The idea of an energy field called The Force surrounding everything is an interesting concept. The trilogy mainly revolves around the journey of Luke Skywalker (Mark Hamill) into becoming a Jedi knight, the former guardians of peace and justice. Luke meets smuggler Han Solo (Harrison Ford,) Chewbacca, C-3PO, R2-D2, and rescues Princess Leia (Carrie Fisher.) He must also conquer his fear, and face Darth Vader (David Prowse, voice of James Earl Jones.) <br />All 3 Star Wars films are astonishing in their own way. The first Star Wars introduced us to our heroes, and also introduced us to Darth Vader and the evil Empire. The first film is the second best in the series. The Empire Strikes Back is the mother of all sequels. Empire is the best in the series. This film is remarkable for being the most notably different Star Wars film created. Everyone is at the top of their game. We also get to meet Yoda, the ancient Jedi master who helps Luke with his Jedi training. Empire is also notable for it's tantalizing cliffhanger. You know what I'm talking about. Return Of The Jedi is the worst in the trilogy, but it's still an excellent film. It's an excellent conclusion. In this one, we get to see our heroes defeat the Empire, and destroy the evil Emporer. Also notable for the ultimate lightsaber duel between Luke and Darth Vader.<br />Overall, the Star Wars Trilogy features some of thebest movies ever made. These films are such a treat to watch.<br />Overall Trilogy Grade: A+ (10++++)
B00005JKBC|1.0|Spy Game is an intellectual \\"thriller\\" that brings together two of Hollywood's best: Robert Redford and Brad Pitt.  Unfortunately, it was this attempt to be intelligent that brought the movie to its knees.  The beginning of the movie seemed promising (Brad Pitt's desperate attempt to escape the Chinese prison), yet the script turned out be very dry and the action very limited.  A large portion of Spy Game was spent largely on dialogue... not very good dialogue, mind you.  More captivating films tend to show these professional spies in action, i.e. jumping out of airplanes or making large buildings explode.  This may not be the case in real life, but it's what we paid to see.<br />Robert Redford may have acted his character well, but was he interesting enough to glue his audience to the screen?  And then about halfway into the film, Redford's character has a flashback back to the Vietnam days that almost completely de-rails the whole focus of the film.  The viewers get stuck into a helicopter combat sequence that really adds nothing to the movie as a whole.<br />>> 1 star.  Takes a ridiculous amount of patience to enjoy this movie.  Almost too much so.
B00005JKDQ|5.0|Really the best film this year. Boo is the cutest thing ever.
B00003CXTF|4.0|Like many people, I saw this film at the cinema and while everyone was saying it was just a 'Titanic' about another disaster that had happened, I really enjoyed the film because I thought it was fantastically produced and the special effects were amazing-the only thing that I thought had let the film down a bit was the 3-way love triangle; but I guess they had to expand the story somehow.<BR>I had the video bought for me and I still love the film, but it isn't as impressive on a small screen with comparatively little volume-the special effects are still great but they don't seem AS special!!  So I would recommend buying it only if 1) You really  really loved the film, 2) You have a huge cinema-like TV screen with surround-sound, or 3) You are in to collectibles.
B000002A3T|5.0|This album really proved it for me. Pink Floyd was just as good or better without Waters. I had always suispected it. Pre_gilmore Floyd was really lousy. Gilmore joined and they became a great band. Waters left and they remained a great band. This album provs it. Gilmore's guitar work is awesome, as are Wright's keyboard work. This is one of Pink Floyd's best.
B00003CWRX|5.0|This a beautifully made & deeply spiritual film (Michael Mann's best, I think) about two men who discover the difficulty of achieving success in modern American life when the power structure is controlled by a few multi-billion dollar corperations w/ mutual interests. Russle Crowe & Al Pacino's characters both learn some hard lessons about what being succesfull in the 90's really requires.
0446310786|5.0|I never read this in High School or College or any of those opportunities when you read &quot;the classics&quot;.  But I've gone back and read many of the classics and this is easily in my top 10 best books ever!  Not only is the story entertaining, but the emotion and the action of the book is fantastic.  You'll laugh, you'll cry...  And if you are a fan of the movie (which I am...Gregory Peck at his best...) you'll really love reading the book!  If the movie is one of the best movies ever made, the book exceeds it simply based on the fact that it is twice the story of the movie!  The movie sticks to the story very closely, but they edit out about half of what happens in the book!  The trial happens about half-way through the book, rather than toward the very end, like in the movie.  And after reading the book, several scenes in the movie make much more sense!<br />This one is definitely five-star book and I'd say it is one of the best books out ever written!  Don't hesitate to read this one!
B000002H8F|5.0|I've been a fan of Pixies and Frank Black-related material for years, but haven't made many reviews. Anyway, this is by far my favorite of all theri albums. It combines their raw punkish energy with their capacity for beautiful melodies perfectly, to me it's their masterwork. Here's a song by song little synopse..<br />&quot;Cecilia Ann&quot;: Great straitforward LA punk instrumental. This little irresistible even made an apeearance on the film Kicking And Screaming.<br />&quot;Rock Music&quot;: One of the most dissonant and wild songs they ever did, the lyrics probably aren't their best (hard to hear) but the song works period.<br />&quot;Velouria&quot;: Lovely. Along with &quot;Ana&quot; and &quot;Havalina&quot;, the thoroughly most beautiful song on the album. A little romaunt dedicated to an otherworldly love who tries to hop on a trampoline out of this world...every summer, every summer...AND HOW DOES LEMUR SKIN REFLECT THE SEA? You'll find that Frank has alot of alien lovers in his songs.<br />&quot;Alison&quot;: A quick punk ditty about jazz musician something Alison. Can't rember the first name, but that's who it's for.<br />&quot;Is She Weird&quot;: One of my favorite all time Pixies songs, and a fave of many of my friends as well. It's catchy, bizarre, and intriguing and the chorus is absolutely ghoulish. It won't dissapoint you.<br />&quot;Ana&quot;: Small but transcendant. Pure bossanova surf music, it reflects Frank's continuing interest in that style of music. Ride a wave, ride a wave...<br />&quot;All Over The World&quot;: One of the longer epics, along with &quot;The Happening&quot;. It spends the first half in a regular stanza, which is great by the way, then on the second half is largely instrumental improv while Frank speaks some cluttered logic: &quot;Time is an arrangement. Time is an arranger. I am a derangement&quot;.<br />&quot;Dig For Fire&quot;: One of their most radio friendly (along with &quot;Here Comes Your Man&quot; if you can believethat), a light hearted Talking Heads-esque romp about platypi and digging for hell.<br />&quot;Down To The Well&quot;: Hardcore. I can hardly wait til we go down to the well either, and &quot;What matter does it make if they'll be favorite songs playing in my head?&quot;<br />&quot;The Happening&quot;: THe second epic. A cooly done number that starts out with Frank screaming about Area 51, than the last half has him narrating a tale of messianic arrival. <br />&quot;Blown Away&quot;: Speedy, cosmic vibrations from deep into space. This one flows into...<br />&quot;Hangwire&quot;: Dark yet comedic. &quot;Every morning of every day/I'll bossanova with ya!&quot;<br />&quot;Stormy Weather&quot;: &quot;It is time for stormy weather/It is...&quot; He repeats this endlessly. Creates the imagery nicely.<br />&quot;Havalina&quot;: The perfect ending song. The poetry is scarce, but combined with the breathtaking arrangements, it makes you feel like you are really in Arizona running with an invisible love lost to the ages. <br />.././..what more can I say? You can't go wrong with this album...
B000002HH2|5.0|Thank God we have artists like Bjork around, giving us a break from the Top 40 Hitlist from hell! <BR>Bjork puts every ounce of herself into her music, and her emotions come through crystal clear. The compositions she comes up with blow my mind. She can do an industrial sounding song, such as &quot;Army of Me&quot; and then turn around and do some jazz with &quot;Its Oh So Quiet.&quot; <BR>&quot;Post&quot; is definitely my favorite album so far by Bjork. It has sooo many different elements to it, its mind-blowing. <br />If you like to experiment with different types of music, don't pass this one up, you won't be disappointed.
B00005UW7V|1.0|I was so looking forward to seeing this movie. I am a fan of both Kubrick and Spielberg. What a dissapointment. There goes 3 hrs of my life I will never get back. It was like watching a Kevin Costner movie. I just felt irritated that this whole movie was based on people's selfishness.  I only gave it the one star and that was for Jude Law.
B000021YQV|4.0|Ever since \\"Chop Suey!\\" made it's way somehow into the rock mainstream with it's chorus of \\"I don't think you trust in my sellf-righteous suicide\\" existing behind the unique arrangements (appealing to similar fake angst bands like Papa Roach), System Of A Down have been talked about incessantly and most of the talkers only know of that one song. Despite all the hype, this is still a very good if somewhat samey album that weaves in politics with occasionally imaginative lyrics and a fine mixture of mostly Arabian and death metal styles. The first three songs are full up with political appeal, \\"Prison Song\\" and \\"Needles\\" are some great attacks against the drug industry and its sinister controlling potentials, the latter of the two features the band tackling on some hardcore 'hey hey' punk ska. Other political lyrics are found in \\"X\\" (speaking out against the endless propagation and nullifying of fascist governments), \\"Science\\" (all about how the rationality of the modern world has destroyed the imagination and freedom of the world), and here and there in other songs which are more ambiguous to pinpoint if they're political or aestethic. More free and less down your throat songs are \\"Jet Pilot\\" (\\"Wired were the eyes of a horse on a jet pilot/One that smiled as he flew over the bay!\\"), \\"Pogo\\" (relating a sexual orgy fantasy where a pogostick is obviously a metaphor for a part of the human body), \\"Forest\\" (possibly my favorite here, \\"Why don't you know that you are my son...\\"), the title track which is also one of the main highlights of the album (\\"...eating seeds as a pasttime activity...\\") and \\"Shimmy\\" is kind of inbetween. \\"Aerials\\" and \\"Atwa\\" are the more mellow of the set, real good songs can't remember the lyrics right now but they rock. Despite \\"Chop Suey!\\" and its mainstream penetration, it is one of the more style-shifting of the set and easily appealable. So that I don't leave any songs out there's also \\"Psycho\\", a catchy tempo-altering tune about a drug addictfan, and the AFrican-drum filled bonus track is an entertaining indicator of future releases. The result is straitforwardly rocking fusion of metal and Arabic music cultures, which can make you jam and think simultaneously like an At The Drive-In or Fugazi record.
B00005NWM3|1.0|This is VERY bad. It gets one star for one OKAY song. But all you need to do is listen to the first song and then you'll know the rest of the cd. This cd is so bad the first time i listend to the whole thing fully, i had already decided i would never listen to it again. If you want something that is really bad and overplayed, but if you want a good cd DO NOT GET THIS CD!
B0000640VO|5.0|I need not wax lyrical over Amelie as everything has been said before in the other reviews.<BR>In a nutshell:<BR>Amelie is a beautiful and touching movie.<BR>I found myself weeping at inappropriate points during the film as a result of its sublime writing and direction.<BR>The Oscars were a sham.<BR>Now that I have that out of my system could I ask for all lovers of this type of cinema to bug Amazon, DVD stores and anyone else they can think of to release Delicatessen on DVD?<BR>I heard a rumour that it is to be released in Europe (finally!) but since I moved from Britain to Canada this news does me no good.<BR>Buy Amelie, City of Lost Children, even Alien Ressurection and then maybe somebody important will realise their mistake.<BR>Thank you.
B0000029DD|5.0|Grace has changed lives, its as simple as that. Jeff Buckley bleeds emotion through your speakers and captures the pure essence of rock and roll. While many critics speculate that the popularity of this album centers around the singer's untimely death, it is obvious that the music is what drives a person to own this CD. I made the mistake of not telling my sister that he had died a while back and she couldn't believe that she would never get the opportunity to see this man perform. My only consolation was that we are all in the same boat. All we have left is his music and that will have to do until we join him. \\"You never said your last good-bye as you took your swim in the Mississippi.\\" -GF  Buy this album; it is more than just a relic of the man who passed, it is a living, breathing entity which ignites the soul and captivates the heart.
B000001DU5|5.0|Although Teats For Fears were often portrayed as run-of-the-mill synth popsters, I can never admit to having held that view. Although I must confess Orzabal's language entirely lacks the sophistication one expects of a genuine singer/songwriter, he shows a tenderness for the characters in his songs even the most socially conscious rock bands never have shown.<BR>In addition, one could never say that a band with songs focused on corruption \\"Sowing the Seeds of Love\\", poverty \\"Everybody Wants to Rule The World\\" and violence \\"Shout\\" could be grouped with the run-of-the mill pop bands. And the sophistication of the first half of this record is refreshing, combining with Orzabal's serious yet beautiful tunes to make one of the finest snapshots of the 1980s available.<BR>This first side clearly shows how the group progressed from synthsters to sophisticated rockers (admittedly in reverse). Even at the time of \\"The Hurting\\", Orzabal shows he can write beautiful and tender songs on the semi-autobiographical \\"Mad World\\" (\\"Went to school and I was very nervous/No one knew me, no one knew me.<BR>In summary, a must-have to understand and reflect on the decade that was the 1980s
1577311523|1.0|I found this book lacking in understanding and compassion for the complexity of human existence. It also lacked a clear understanding of the goodness of a loving creator. For someone claiming to understand the role of \\"ego\\" as the author claims he does, he certainly has an interesting way of allowing himself to be portrayed by others in his introductions and forwards. He seems to be tied into the identity of \\"Spiritual Master\\". It is easy to claim spiritual experience. It is easy to give out partial truths and then embellish them.  It is easy to embellish truths in ways that lead readers into thinking if they disagree or feel uncomfortable, it is the reader's lack of understanding or immaturity on the spiritual path that needs to be looked at. It is easy to get the reader to disregard the possibility of flaws with the author's perceptions and the authors own immaturity. However, it is not always easy to fool all of the people all of the time. Do not waste your money- this is just another book in a long line of guru type books that try to capture a desperate audience. It will have its' adherents who swear by it and pass on all the inconsistencies and uncompassionate views while they pass themselves off as superior \\"enlightened beings\\". Unfortunately, they will do little to \\"enlighten\\" a society in pain all the while insisting it is the people who are in pain that need to be \\"enlightened\\".
B000002VFW|5.0|Whilst this record cannnot be seen as artistic, Stansfield sings with an angelic beauty that has never been rivalled. She can convey romantic emotion with unrivalled effect on such songs as &quot;This Is The Right Time&quot;, &quot;Mighty Love&quot;, &quot;What Did I Do To You&quot;, &quot;Wake Up Baby&quot; and the title tune. Never does she miss a note on this record, and her lyrics express her feelings about those she has loved with unrivalled effect and consistency.<BR>Her voice is well backed up by Devaney's and Morris' sparing arrangements, which give her all the room she needs to display her incredible vocal prowess. The string and horn arrangements back up the sparse synthesisers exceptionally well, especially on &quot;All Around The World&quot;, &quot;Poison&quot; and &quot;The Love In Me.&quot; This skilful arrangements makes the songs melodic and tuneful in a way often missing in dance-floor music, and this makes it an excpetionally consistently enjoyable album that is impossible to beat amongst accessible pop albums.
B00004Z400|5.0|this cd is great. it's perfection. the lead singer is so wonderful, you should all buy it.
0385484518|5.0|This book is an excellent source for the roads taken in life. It has brought me much enlightment in the way I view life and appreciate it. With so many self help books out there, this book is the only one you need becuase it touches you right in the heart. Initially this book was given as an assignment and I was really not elated about it but once I started reading the book, I finished it in one setting within four hours. The way Morrie looked at life taught me to appreciate the small things and not take things for granted. Read this book and you will understand life so much more.
B00005YXZH|5.0|I had listened to this since last year when it was available on the website. I have always been a Wilco, Son Volt &amp; UT fan, anyway, but on first listen I didn't know what to make of it. However, on the second try, without doing anything else but listening, I was definitely hooked. I bought the &quot;real&quot; cd when it came out &amp; it is definitely worth it, even if you have the prerelease. I saw them last week &amp; they played every song on YHF; which everyone in the audience already knew the words to every song. Not every UT fan is a Wilco fan and this may be too much for the &quot;alt-country&quot; (a label which I really hate) fans, but if you really appreciate music and the effort a band can put forth, you will enjoy this. It sure beats all the commercial stuff out there that other labels are pushing down our throats, thinking we would fall for that. But, thank god for Jeff &amp; Wilco giving us this wonderful album. I agree, best album this year.

0767830555|5.0|In my humble opinion - the best way to get the message is to watch the entire DVD one night - just to get the story. Than let it be for 2-3 weeks or even longer. Go back to it only when you're REALLY in the mood for T.D., and try to get the air of this outstanding project - with music, long looks of the 70s, digesting the \\"Animals come out at night\\" or \\"You're talkin' to me?!!!\\" scenes ... It happened to me about a week ago, that it made me look over-and-over T.D. 3 times in a day. Happy to have it on DVD not VHS - the tape would excoriate very soon ...
B00003CXTG|2.0|you know, the best thing about this movie was the trailer that i saw before the movie actually came out. that was one of the best trailers for a film i have ever seen. it drew out the emotion of that attack like nothing else could. why is it though that jerry bruckheimer and michael bay can't stop being so sappy with their films and just letting the event sap the emotion out of us. they do this with Armageddon and The Rock, and now with Pearl Harbor. be wary of the next Bay/Bruckheimer production....bring lots of emotion to be &quot;sapped.&quot;
0790729652|4.0|It seems that all of the comic book to film movies don't usually work, and live up to its expectations... But with further due Batman doesn't fit in these catergories, if you read a Batman comic and enjoyed it, you will definenlty enjoy this movie.<br /> Many people who are not into the Batman comics often think of Batman as the television show in the 60's. A more of a slap stick style of a show, a mere [bad show] of Bob Kanes Dark knight comics. This movie The Batman is nothing like that show, this movie has entertainment and grit! And yes the Joker does give us the laughter of the movie. Nicholson is the star of the movie, an over done job as the Joker. He was a perfect match for his role.<br /> The acting and the special affects makes this a classic movie. A direct comic replica of the Batman! This movie will not be missed or forgotten, its a movie for all ages. Everybody has a little Bat inside of them!

B000002KNY|5.0|I found an old LP, put it on my dusty turntable...and was transported. This is the best Talking Heads album lyrically and musically.  These melodies get stuck in your head.  It's their finest work.  Just buy it and luxuriate in the lushness.

B00000C3G6|5.0|An unmitigated masterpiece. Strive to own this IMMEDIATELY.
B00003CX5P|2.0|Let's face it: \\"Star Wars Episode I: The Phantom Menace\\" will forever be known as the worst Star Wars movie ever produced. Even people who seriously defend this movie have to agree Episodes IV, V, and VI were better. The big question concerning this movie: what went wrong? How could the most hyped movie of all time coin the term \\"Episode I Syndrome\\"? The answer is simple: \\"The Phantom Menace\\" tries to be too much of what the first three movies were known for and fails to allow other factors have the same degree of quality.<br />When \\"Star Wars: A New Hope\\" was released, it was praised for its then-revolutionary special effects, and the next two movies received an equal amount of praise. But George Lucas also managed to give these movie a coherent and suitable plot so they wouldn't be seen as \\"tech-demos\\". When CGI evolved, movies started to use them more and more, until some movies were nothing but. \\"Tron\\", \\"The Haunting\\", and \\"The Mummy Returns\\" are all infamous examples of movies that utilized excellent special effects but had nothing else to show for it. \\"Episode I\\", unfortunately, joins this crowd.<br />The movie becomes questionable at the very beginning, when the famous Star Wars Theme plays and the opening paragraph runs. Unlike previous Star Wars openings, this one talks about...politics? We're introduced to the new Star Wars movie not with a galactic battle or terrible crisis, but politics? Why? Then we meet the two Jedi and immediately we sense something is wrong. Why is the dialogue so...stiff? Emotionless? Even flat? Aren't the two actors enjoying themselves? Aren't they glad they're in a legendary Star Wars movie? Sadly, the movie never tells us, because this kind of feeling remains throughout the entire movie.<br />Despite some really interesting battles, the central theme of the story remains politics, and this was Lucas's first mistake. Isn't the saga called Star WARS? Lucas' second mistake was his biggest: the CGI. Now, it's not that this CGI is bad; in fact, it's probably some of the best ever created for a film. The problem is that Lucas uses it far too much. It's as if in every other scene Lucas decided, \\"I think I'll put a wow-inducing special effect here. It might not be necessary, but it'll look cool.\\" And sadly, the high use of CGI contributed to the low quality of plot and acting. <br />The plot is probably the flimsiet plot ever devised in a Star Wars film, and the actors don't seem to be enjoying themslves at all. We never connect with Liam Neeson's Qui-Con Jinn, and Ewan McGregor's Obi-Wan Kenobi doesn't match the one played by the late, great Alec Guinness. Jake Lloyd can't make us sympathize with the boy that'll eventually grow up to be Darth Vader, and Natalie Portman can't seem to push herself to be Queen Amidala. Probably the only characters who actually enjoy themselves are the entirely-CGIed ones such as Watto and Jar Jar Binks, but the trouble is most moviegoers find Jar Jar so annoying that they really don't care. This also shows that Lucas was probably more interested in the CGI effects than the actual actors.<br />How Star Wars fans see this film is very relative. Some don't mind it and actually like it; others find it a complete blasphemy to the Star Wars mythos (Midichlorians, anyone?). But everyone has to agree that George Lucas made some serious mistakes with this movie and that \\"Episode I\\" doesn't even compare to the three original movies. Whether or not \\"Episode I: The Phantom Menace\\" is merely a giant preview for the (hopefully) superior \\"Episode II: Attack of the Clones\\" we'll have to wait and see. Whether or not \\"Episode I\\" is a good movie is all up to you.
B00005RHGK|4.0|Jeepers Creepers was the scariest movie i have seen since friday 13th. The monster could be better, but the movie still scared the sh!t out of me with its goory scenes and groosome ending. This movie will make you [wet] your pants. I recomend this movie to anyone who is in desperate need of nightmares.this movie is way scarier than 13 ghosts and joy ride.
B00000IBRI|5.0|&quot;phenomena&quot; is probably argento's best film since &quot;inferno&quot;, and it takes the viewer back into the realm of dream, hallucination, surreality and the occult that gives argento's films that unique flavor of the bizarre which is his alone. jennifer, a student at a boarding school in italy with an odd propensity for communicating with insects, is stalked by a serial killer who has been knocking off young women left and right around the campus. the opening scene features a hand being nailed to a wall, and a waterfall decapitation.  geez, dario.  simmer down.<br />in this film, however, many of argento's usual flaws are pleasantly absent--the soundtrack works perfectly and compliments the beautiful, hallucinatory images, the dialogue isn't too ridiculous, and the characters are for the most part believable. (sort of.)<br />and donald pleasance in an argento film!! as soon as i heard about that i had to have it. pleasance always does well in horror movies, and he gives a sterling performance as the doctor who tries to help jennifer understand her connection to the yucky world of bugs.  some of the final scenes get a little grotesque, what with indoor baths of maggots and various other insects, but overall this film is wonderful.  a red flag for all true horror fans
B00003CXTG|1.0|Seeing the endless onslaught of extremely abominable `American Pie' style gross-out humor being foisted upon the movie going public these days,  this `Pearl Harbor' doesn't seem all that bad anymore...actually, compared to `Tomcats', or `The Sweetest Thing', this movie is almost `Citizen Kane'...<br />Look, this is the `Pearl Harbor' movie to see if  you find `The History  Channel' intolerably boring, and you're entertained by watching a sappy, brainless love story that gets rudely interrupted when Pearl Harbor is suddenly attacked by Hollywood's special effects industry...<br />On the other hand, if you don't want your intelligence insulted and wish to see a REAL movie about `Pearl Harbor', then check out the infinitely less glamorous, but historically accurate and intellectually superior `Tora! Tora! Tora!'...<br />...Now just hope and pray we don't have `American Pearl Harbor Pie III' to look forward to... April 30,2002 lr**
B000002UJQ|5.0|Ok I am a little biased because Radiohead is my favorite band, but that does't take away from the fact that they have never made a bad album.  OK Computer is a good place to start for anyone who is interested in buy a radiohead cd,although the bends is my personal favorite.  Paraniod Andriod is possibly there best put together song ever.  The way that every instrument blends together on this song, including thom's voice, is almost unfound in music today.  A definate must in your cd collection.
B000065AQU|5.0|I had already bought the other special edition cd that came with the cd rom disc and i loved it.  When i saw this i had to buy it just for the bonus dvd.  It was very worth it.  Toxicity is a good video and the three live performances of prison song, chop suey! and bounce are awesome.  It is very worth the money to buy this cd.  Even if you have the cd itself already, buy this version too.
B00005B4GU|5.0|Lets for get about RH being musicians all together, artist is a more perfect title for this brillantly talented group. Beautiful from studdering piano to waining lyrics to early era jazz arrangements. Pyramid song's lyrics and studdering musical arrangement are possibly the best sinle the band has created since Paraniod Andriod was released.  Statement on society driven Knives Out and Dollars and Cents are standouts.  Paranioa is still evident on I Might be Wrong. And who else learns how to play and sing a song backwards.  In my opinion Like Spinning Plates and the jazzy Life in a Glass House are the best and most thought provoking songs on the album.  Buy this and every RH cd you dont own and buy them soon.  Please help us keepThom's new baby clothed
0345350499|5.0|If you love authurian tales, or even if you have never even read one, this is the book for you.<BR>Marrion Zimmer Bradley had a new and invigorating idea to tell the 'true' tale of Arthur through the eyes of the many women in his life such as Igrain, Vivian, Morgain, and a few others.<BR>Beautifully writen, new portrails of characters long ago forgoten like Merlin, gives a new view on the life of avalon and all it's surroundings in the time of Arthur.
B00004XONN|5.0|Quite possibley the most important album to be released since Nirvana's Nevermind.  Honestly this is not my favorite RH album but its beauty is undeniable.  Influnces from Massive Attack, Portisehead, and DJ Shadow(if you dont own UNKLE you need to by that album after you buy this one) are given a Radioheadesk twist.  I loved Kid A ever since i first heard it on the MTV2 premiere but it takes some ppl a little longer.  If you dont like it at first try try again start with Idioteque(which reminds me of Aphex Twin) Optimistics catchy hooks will soon be stuck in your head and if youre in a somber mood try out How to Disappear Completely which is the best on the album.  The National Anthem, Morning Bell,  Motion Picture Soundtrack are stand outs.  This album is the bridge to the next big thing in music.  You better get used to it because this is where the music industry is heading now. Buy this album and play it over and over and over and over and over and over and over and over and over.
B00003CXC6|4.0|After watching Rashmon and 7 Samurai ... it was no wonder that Kirosawa is the most acclaimed director of the East. Though the movie was made at a  time of Black and white ... its story and cinematography was surprisingly unconventional and could rival any Hollywood movie of mordern times.<br />It had a story that you will find exciting enough to glue you to the screen to know the ending. When it ended you find yourselve so empty that you actually still do not know the real truth. In the end you'll never know what actually happened. Trying to piece the truths together prove to be impossible just like any truths you might hear in the mordern times.<BR>  <BR>However, the 3 stories which made up the film work better if it had more grey areas. Its was pretty unbelievable that the three stories could be so different though the idea that the truth will never be the truth is a theme that would never go out of date, but just simply not very popular among mordern movie makers. <br />Its a better and more thought provoking movie than the more popular 7 Samurai and I would recommend to all this classic that have as theme that would never go out of date
B00004X0Q0|5.0|This band changed my life.  Before hearing this album I was stuck in the hum-drum world of mainstream music.  Then I heard this band and ran out and bought everything the band has ever released.  I was instantaniously submerged into the \\"underground\\" sceen.  The industry has been waiting for the heir to Nirvana's throne since Kurt's death.  So where were they looking that it took them so long to notice this band. Well after years of constant touring dreary bars they now have the power to sell out shows, if they are ever come back from their hiatis.  This whole album is great.  What else would you expect from a band this talented produced by someone like Ross Robinson. Even godfather of punk Iggy Pop wanted a piece of the action.  More polished and diverse than In/Casino/Out, their best album in my opinion, Relationship of Command is a work of art from begining to end.  Patteren Against User; One Armed Siccor; Invalid Litter Department are instant classics.  The true gems of this album come latter in the album in the form of Quarantined;Non Zero Possibilities.  That doesnt mean the rest of the songs are just filler they are all good but those are the ones you will find your self singing while your working.  A must have but you also must buy In/Casino/Out. And keep your eyes open for Sparta and Mars Volta because they are going to be great bands as well they have to be, they were at the drive in.
B000060P79|5.0|I seen Simple Plan in concert when they were touring with Sugar Ray, and ever since then their songs were ringing in my head. I downloaded 'em all, and as soon as I could I bought the Cd. I've listened to it non-stop since. They're songs are upbeat, but have that punk egde which makes you start tapping your foot and bouncing. Plus, the songs are about topics you can relate to, like One Day where all everyone wants to do is grow up... and Worst Day Ever, well we all can relate. BUY IT!! :D
B000002TQV|5.0|If you have ever loved and lost then this album was made for you.  One listen to and you will fill so emotionally drained the only thing you can do is play it over and over again.  With soul scrapping lyrics and and heart piercing music this album will instantly become one of your favorites.  Every song on this album has been my favorite song at one point in time.  Gut wrenching Fake Plastic Trees and Bulletproof...I Wish i Was are classics along with melodic High and Dry and Street Spirt.  Black Star and Nice Dream are played over and over again everytime I listen to this album.  If you are a fan of the guitar driven RH of Pablo Honey then check out Planet Teletex, The Bends, Just(which is an awesome video), and My Iron Lung.  As with all RH albums The Bends is beautiful from beginning to end.  I could go on forever about this cd but i only get 1,000 words so I'll just say this is the album that made me fall in love with this band and is still my favorite.  In addition the liner notes contain some of Thom's best art work.  Buy it.
B000002IWQ|5.0|This would have to be my favorite Rush album from their 4th set of albums. In order (from favorite, to LEAST favorite album), they are &quot;Counterparts&quot;, &quot;Test For Echo&quot;, &quot;Roll The Bones&quot;, and &quot;Presto&quot;. (I will be including my review for &quot;Vapor Trails&quot; when that is released!) My fav songs are...Animate, Stick It Out, Cut To The Chase, Nobody's Hero, Double Agent, and Leave That Thing Alone! Alot of awesome and heavy guitar playing from Alex is widely shown in this album, Geddy's bass lines are really cool, and this album also has some of Neil's best drumming. Overall, this is an enjoyable album.
B000002UJQ|5.0|A must have.  If you dont own this cd then i only have ask one question, where have you been for the last 5 years.  The musical arrangements on this album are among the best of all time.  &quot;Paraniod Andriod&quot; is a modern day epic, Homers Odessy set to music.  &quot;Subterranian Homesick Alien&quot;; &quot;Exit Music&quot; are the true hidden gyms on this album with thier beatiful imagery.  &quot;No Surprises&quot;; &quot;Karma Police&quot;; &quot;Lucky&quot; are great but that goes with out saying, I mean its Radiohead for crying out loud. Buy this cd, right now.  Start at &quot;Airbag&quot; and listen till &quot;The Tourist&quot; is over. More than likely you will then put your cd player on repeat.
B000056K04|5.0|I have read some reviews that say, &quot;his old stuff is better&quot; or, &quot;it was ok&quot;. Well i believe that Dave has hit it again. He invented a whole new era and style of music. No matter how many albums he comes out with or how ever many different songs he comes out with his work will always be on top.<BR>     For anyone who is looking into a Dave Matthews Band CD or woundering what they are all about i recomend that you go out and get any one of their cd's right away. No matter which one you get you will not be disappointed. He is by far the best Artist of all time.
B000002UR7|4.0|What a change RH has made since the release of this album.  Im sure you have all heard Creep, which is enough of a reason in its self to buy this cd, but there is definately so much more to this album.  The album starts with You, which is one of the most beautiful songs the band has ever written.  Stop Whispering(a tribute to the Pixes), Anyone Can Play Guitar, Thinking of You, Blow Out, and I Can't make this one of the best cd's from this era and one of the best in my collection. From begining to end it is a masterpiece. It really desevers 4.5 stars. Buy it and remenice with me on the overly guitar driven RH of the early 90's.  Thom sounds like such a man on this album.
B00003CXRM|5.0|What an amazing film!!!  NOT being a Clooney fan (I can't get past that whole Facts of Life thing!) I found it difficult to bring myself to watch this one -- but I am SO glad I did!  And there is the added bonus of an amazing soundtrack!
B00005B36H|1.0|i don't mind when a band takes off in a new direction, and certainly not in a way that implies that they are 'selling out'. lateralus is a nice advancement for tool and their sound, but i feel that if they're going to try and write six to eight minute songs(if they're going to be this long, you might as well call them 'epics'), you should do a little more with them. to me, this album sounds like they wrote some usual tool material which didn't suck and the song lasted for a good four minutes or so. but cuz they wanted to try something different it sounds to me like they stretched a good four minute song over the span of about six to eight minutes. so when i listen to songs like the grudge or schism, the music seems to 'drag' and feels empty, like it's missing a lot of depth. over the course of the album, i feel like there's a lot of holes in the music and that they are capable of doing a lot more, since tool are comprable(sp?) musicians. if they keep going in this direction, and combine some of the energy(aenmea, hooker with a p3n1s, cold and ugly, prison sex) and ingenuity( message to harry manback, intermission, die eier von satan) they had in previous albums, tool could make one heckuva an album. they need to add more. but as it stands, this is very flat music and there's not nearly enough stuff to keep me interested.<br />i wouldn't say this album is nearly as good as many people seem to think. it's just a long bore. there are a few highlights, the title track, parabola, ticks and leeches, reflection, and faaip de quad. that's a good bit of the album but it wasn't enough to keep me listening.<br />if you would like to hear music similar to tool, i guess you'd just have to listen to the old albums. there are lots of new bands coming out that try to copy the tool sound, but it never sounds as good(earshot comes to mind...
B00005YXZH|5.0|To those reviews refering to the tugging of heartstrings when they hear \\"Ashes of American Flags\\", it is not a patriotic song. it's a pseudo-marxist dirge simultaneously lamenting both our consumerist culture, and our lack of viable alternatives to it. the anti-capitalist message of the song is redeemed, in my view, only by the acknowledgement that \\"all of my lies are only wishes\\". The best reconcilaition i have yet heard for the conflict one experiences when they realize that the seeming utopia promised by left-liberal leanings is great for books and late night bull sessions, but is not realistic as a system or a solution in this world. It is sad to realize that intentions don't matter much in the end, that good ideas sometimes have no place in this world, and that we can be a little ashamed of the world we live in, and yet acknowledge that it is the only world we've got. Tweedy seems to hate materialism, and also acknowldge that the \\"wishes\\" of another way are \\"lies\\". One of the most beautifully hopeless songs i have ever heard. <br />Great album all around.
0811828697|5.0|I bought this book not because i am a starwars fan but because i am a fan of conceptual design of creatures and species. Starwars has some of the best conceptual designers in the business. This bookcase shows an enormous amount creatures from the star wars saga. The species have information about each species; from how they breed to how they fight. Every single page has amazing art front and back. This a book i could not live without.
0345448898|5.0|After demolishing the Harry Potter series, i was left empty and longing for the fifth book. I was given the Pullman trilogy by a friend to help me combat my \\"Potter Blues\\", and i was impressed!<BR>Imagery that was exquisite with a story line to die for, and a new view on the way things could be... for all we know! very brave of Pullman to write a tirlogy such as this and direct it at the younger age group. This is on par with, if not better than, the likes of Narnia, Dickens, Rowling, Robert Lewis Stevenson etc. This is story for all ages and a real eye opener. Mr Pullman... MORE PLEASE
0060278234|5.0|This book was good, starting enough after Sabriel left off to be less of a continuance of that story. Unfortunately, this story ends right as the plot begins to take off.  I really enjoyed the descriptions of the characters, though, and there is definitely a twist.  Also, Nix brings charter magic more into the story than he did in Sabriel, so that was exciting.  The book isn't boring, though it becomes frustrating at times because of the slowness or the fact that you want to read more about Lirael.  I couldn't put it down, but I desperately wanted to start reading the sequel to it, so if you're one of those people who get into a story and won't rest until the story is done, wait until Nix writes the next one, because this story has no real ending, just a \\"Sorry folks, but that's all we have for today\\" type thing.  And that was the most frustrating of all.

B00003CXTG|1.0|OK so you want serious action sequences in a memorable and commemorative setting with a bit of love thrown in. Fine. Buy MIDWAY instead. OK, the love bit is in there but if you are buying a movie for its commemorative value, remember this: a) the flying is real, b) the planes are real, c) the explosions are real and d) the result is real. <br />The guys crashing in the sea do not dry off and go back to their trailers. Think. Reflect. Commemorate the real efforts of real people making real sacrifice. Oh, yeah and enjoy the love bit if you want that too.<br />But it was those real people in the midst of the fight in the movie MIDWAY (and everyone else everywhere else all over the globe then and now) that made Hollwood a place free enough to generate 'Pearl Harbor'.

B0000542D1|5.0|I first saw A hard day's night at the drive-in with my sister when i was 17 in 1964. i am now 54. i love it just as much now as i did then. It is so nice to be able to see them on screen whenever we want to with this great movie they all did together.<BR>     I cannot believe how George got up after falling down like he did in the opening scene! Ringo too.<BR>     I thought they all did a great acting job. It is fun to watch them perform on stage singing as well.<BR>     A movie someone should own if you are a true Beatles fan!!

0375507507|5.0|This book is written with heart, honesty and love for a continent and its people.  I have to admit not being able to put this book down! I have lived in a number of countries as a child and the way that this wonderful author has captured her childhood and the aspects and angles of both her youth and the countries that she lived in, cannot be discribed in any other way other then 'perfection' (it took be back many times).  A fatastic book, which revels some very intimate secrets of an era and genre gone by.  Thank you very much for an excellent piece of literature.
0553208845|5.0|Hesse knows Buddhism.  I could say 'knew' but, as Siddhartha learns, there is no such thing as time.  Hesse also knows how to write.  The prose of the book is simple and direct, and though poetic in its own way, it does not rely on complex metaphor or construction to get its point across.  And yet the book itself is a complex metaphor, a distillation of the principles of Buddhism and, to an extent, Hinduism through the story of Siddhartha, the young Bramin with a streak of Western individualism who wants to be truly free.<br /><br />&quot;Siddhartha&quot; is a powerful statement about Buddhism, both in its reconstruction of Buddhist teachings and in its criticisms of those teachings.  Anyone interested in Buddhism, Hesse, spirituality, individuality, or life and how to live it will surely enjoy this book.  And yet all that I have said is water, as is &quot;Siddhartha.&quot;
0748662529|4.0|The Number One Ladies? Detective Agency, the number one installment in Alexander McCall Smith?s Precious Ramotswe series (okay, I know that I just said a lot but it is better to be done with all that at once rather than having to subject the reader to an attempt at constructing an urbane and cohesive first several sentences that incorporate all of the aforementioned information), introduces the reader to the lady detective and her number one lady agency at its inception.<BR> McCall Smith?s lucid, fluid prose adds remarkable depth and ease of reading to this already fine story.  Ramotswe?s Botswana is a land of tradition dealing with ineveitable arrival of modernization.  Unlike some more hardened detectives, however, Ramotswe does not seek to raze one opposite in favor of the other but to preserve the better qualities of each in the midst of a world that continually brings the two into conflict.  The seemingly arbitrary progression of the novel can be a bit annoying at times but the individual episodes stand to reinforce each other.  This reader gives this first Ramotswe mystery a fine score of seven and two-thirds thumbs up (out of a possible ten).
0140185232|5.0|What an amazing novel!  Maugham's brilliant philosophical tale of self-discovery remains as true today as it did 60 years ago--perhaps even more so.  Though the novel doesn't focus exclusively on Larry, it is his tale more than anything else that lends the novel its power.  The other characters, though thoroughly explored and developed--even more so than Larry--are in many ways no more than the background to his saga.  I won't say too much about the novel itself, other than that I discovered it at a time when it spoke very deeply to me, and I have been profoundly grateful ever since.  If you are at all interested in the life of the mind, or any sort of a life of exploration and of the unordinary, then do yourself a favor and read this today.  Even if you are not, you may enjoy the book throughly, as it is a humorous, well-crafted, and often touching tale.
B00005YTFG|1.0|My wife and I lasted about 1/2 hour into this movie before turning it off.  It's a story based in late 19th century Paris, and focuses on the Bohemian dance hall scene.  Characters include Henri de Toulouse-Lautrec and other historical figures.  My problem with the movie is that the music is not contemporaneous to the time and place.  The songs are modern, i.e., rock music, and this doesn't work well.  Further, the lip-synching is poorly done.  There are also fantasy-based special effects that seem out of place, such as a glittery fireworks display.<br />If you are really open to this kind of thing, you might enjoy Moulin Rouge, but if you are expecting a historically accurate musical film, you'll be in for a not too pleasant surprise.  I've talked to some other people who had the same reaction I did.
6305538018|4.0|This was a great movie for anyone in that sci-fi genre that enjoys movies which help you to escape from reality.  It moves at an appropriate speed and actually goes by like no time has passed, so you just want to watch it again.  You don't need to read through some long review to know that it's good.  And the ending is the best that it could be, because it always keeps you guessing.
B000002UTI|4.0|This soundtrack should have been two CD's. Having said that however, it is the only best of compilation that has Both Beatles and solo material from Lennon on it. The lost weekend period from 73-75 is very much skipped over with Stand By Me being only song from the period and that is a shame. The demo to Real Love which is found only here is a treasure to have and is worth the purchase of the CD. Songs that are missing are Watching the Wheels, Nobody Told Me, Mind Games, Power To the People, Cold Turkey, and Come Together to name but a few. If you are new to Lennon's music however, this CD is certainly the place to begin.
0808514202|5.0|* * * * *<br />The Grapes of Wrath by John Steinbeck is a great read.  It's worth sticking with all 619 pages.  With this book John Steinbeck discusses the Dust Bowl migration.  It may seem as though this may be a boring topic for a book, but this novel is actually very interesting.  Plus, it is a great read when studying about these hard times during history class. The book looks at the situation from two different angels.  It first looks at the migration from the west to California from the eyes of the Joad family and then it looks at the situation from the eyes of any person who has lost everything and has to travel from the west to the east.  The Grapes of Wrath touches on many different themes such as the suppression of man, and how man can pull together though hard times with wrath.  Once you begin to read you really do get into it.  I would have to recommend this book for teenagers on up.  This is because there is some light language and I feel that a young adult would better be able to grasp all of the symbolism and meaning that this book encompasses.
0066620996|5.0|The title of my review may seem extreme, but in my view, it's true. And, I've read hundreds of books on management. It is more useful that Drucker's best for the practicing manager. It avoids the tired cliches of many top sellers (e.g., moving some cheese somewhere--ugh) and it is applicable to any business, any size, most countries.<br />I'm a Professor of Strategy at IMD (Lausanne, Switzerland). Built to Last was a regular part of the diet of material I've given to hundreds of managers over the past 7 years plus. Good to Great is even better. It's a brillant set of ideas not just for their importance, but their packaging. It's a joy to read.<br />Most important: The ideas around the execution of strategy (90% of strategy anyway) are priceless. And, &quot;correct.&quot; Discipline! Hedgehog concept. Stockdale paradox. Being &quot;on the bus&quot;. Collin's gets a the core of what makes a company great. The book parallels much of my thinking, but Collins writes it better. Bravo for him! <br />Personally, I find the level five leadership issues interesting, but less compelling than the second 2/3 of the book. But most managers love to read about leadership, and this is a great place to read about it. The heart of the book for me is when he talks about the choices and discipline that firms need to make, and live by. Very difficult to do in the &quot;real world,&quot; but essential. Without this focus and clear choice, energy, emotion, and talent is disipated. No way to win in today's world.<br />Congratulations to Jim Collins. And thank you!<br />Andy Boynton<BR>Professor of Strategy<BR>IMD, Lausanne
B00005JKCF|5.0|I just watched the movie for the second time at a sneek preview in KL, Malaysia. I went to the premiere here last night, and I expect to be going again soon.<br />Amazing. This movie totally lived up to my expectations. I've always been a Batman and Superman fan, since I was a kid. I occasionally read some Spiderman comics, but I never got much into them.  That, however, has changed since I saw the first trailer for Spiderman. This is probably one of the movies I've most looked forward to seeing, and it beat the hype. The actors are great, the story had me hooked with a great balance of humor and drama, and the special effects are just incredible. It really feels like the comic come to life. The webslinging, dialogue, and even the poses are spot-on. The ending leaves the film open for a sequel, which I'll be greatly looking forward to.<br />I don't want to spoil anything so I won't say more. The only thing I was really annoyed with is the cinema where I watched it. For some reason it wasn't in widescreen, and they censored big chunks of a main scene out of the movie. All the kisses where censored too. I understand that certain things can be inappropriate to show to everyone, but thats why there are movie ratings and censoring a kiss...come on.<br />Anyway I hate to conclude on a bad note, so I'll repeat myself. This movie is great. Two hours of pure spidey bliss. I've rarely enjoyed a movie this much. Mad props to all those involved in making this movie, I hope they crash the box office.
B000060P79|5.0|This cd is great!  Simple Plan is a new band from Canada, but they're hitting it strong.  This band consists of five gorgous guys, who know what they're doing.  There 1st cd &quot;No Helmets, No Pads... Just Balls&quot; hit stores March 23rd.  If you like Blink 182 and/or Sum41, then you will most definitely like Simple Plan.  So, if you enjoy punk/rock/alternative music and are looking for something new and hip to listen to, then try this cd.  Believe me, you won't be disappointed!
0385484518|4.0|This was a great story about a man who wouldn't let death ruin his life.  He kept on living and teaching until it was his time.  I loved all that he taught Mitch.  Those were things we all needed to hear.<br />Great book!  Cannot wait to pass it on to friends!!
B000065U1N|5.0|I read the book and loved it. I watched the movie and loved it. Doubtful that they could reproduce the climax from the book in a movie, but they achieve it. The movie is filled with intense action as the story unfolds. The time passed really quickly while watching this movie.<br />To enjoy the movie even better, read the book. It will be a quick reading since its intensity keeps you reading until you are finished.<br />Enjoy !!!
B00004U8H4|5.0|If you have read the book you will understand how great this movie really is.  Christian Bale captures the character of Pat Bateman so well its remarkable. If you say this movie is bad it's because you don't understand it.  Really get an indepth look in the movie if you combine it with some of nature's finest.
1565847032|5.0|Required reading.<br />It is pretty much a given that Chomsky's ideas are compelling, whether you agee or not. The extraordinary value-add in this book is the editing job. It is obvious and gigantic. The authors have organized Chomsky's talks into logically flowing, highly documented, and parallel-structured snippets of one to three pages each - and there are a couple of hundred of them. Most of them open with an audience question, and a quick retort by Chomsky. This is followed by a key word: Look, Actually, or See, after which Chomsky goes into huge depth and detail, never straying from the focus. Again, the editing is what makes it all compelling, useful, and evenly paced. The amount of work that went into tearing apart years of talks, conversations and lectures, and then organizing them in complementary sections, making them fit a format that allows the reader to breeze through (well relatively breeze through) the densely packed insights of Noam Chomsky deserves some sort of award.<br />The footnotes are the most useful and detailed I have ever seen. They are a monumental standalone work in and of themselves. I only wish THEY were indexed like the book is - after all, there are 449 pages of them, compared to 401 pages in the book.<br />While Chomsky comes off as extraordinarily insightful, there are weaknesses - holes you could really exploit if you ever had the privilege of arguing with him. His knowledge of financial markets and foreign currency exchange, hedge funds and such is not only superficial, but sometimes just plain wrong. Sometimes he generalizes immense conclusions from a few superficial and specifically chosen facts that ignore the complexity of the situation. This kind of inductive reasoning befits the ranting fundamentalists (of all stripes) he belittles, and is surprising from someone as &quot;fair&quot; as Noam Chomsky.  He also completely misunderstands the power of celebrity and familiarity, missing and even denying his own leverage. In other words, he is human after all!<br />Perhaps then, there is actually less here than meets the eye? I don't think so. I think this book is so well edited, it actually allows the reader to surgically inspect the workings of this fine mind, to put things in frames of reference and perspective, and even to claim the occasional victory over Noam Chomsky in the safety of one's own home and without a half hour rebuttal.<br />If you're up for the wild ride to places in your own back yard, Undertanding Power is very highly recommended.words, he is human after all! <br />Perhaps then, there is actually less here than meets the eye?

0385335482|2.0|As I got further along in this book, I started to hate Rebecca Bloomwood.  What a self-absorbed, manic martyr.  While I understand not handling finances well, it just seems as if she blames the world for her problems.  And the plot twists were so obvious.  And her sudden maturity at the end of the novel was so forced.  As a final nail in the coffin, I felt it was such a ripoff of the Bridget Jones-esque style.  HOWEVER, it was a light read, fluffy and sometimes enjoyable.
B00000J7J4|5.0|You need a good sound system to appreciate this album! There are lots of backgorund instruments that add plenty of flavor to all the tracks on this album. Even if you don't understand Spanish, &quot;Corazon Espinado&quot; and &quot;Primavera&quot; will touch your spirit.
6305132984|5.0|Whether you like musicals or not, this is an amazing DVD to add to your collection. The picture and sound quality seems really good, and watching the dance scenes in letterbox really add to the film as a whole. Personally the dancing fight scenes are kind of cheesey, but that's why I like it... This movie is guaranteed to put a smile on your face (because you're either loving the music, studying the imagery and visual metaphors, or laughing at the cheesey gang members frolicking around each other in very tight pants).
B00005JKYS|5.0|While I was too young to serve in Vietnam I do remember the controversy and pain that the war caused.  The daily news reports and the folks on your very own block that received bad news about a loved one, for what?  <br />This movie captures both the emotional side of the women left to worry about their men and the closeness of the men that went to fight.  Of particular interest was the studious leader (Mel Gibson) who researched everything before going in to battle.  Knowing the enemy and his traits, this is not something normallly portrayed in a movie about the Vietnam War. <br />And what an excellent movie that kept me (and my date) both glued to the end of our seats.  The action is both excitiing and depressing at the same time.  The true face of war.  An awesome reflection on the tragedy of it all.  <br />I highly recommend this movie to anyone who can look past the violence and senselessness of war, any war, but especially the Vietnam War (as far as senselessness).  <br />Do yourself a favor, see this movie ASAP.
B00000K0EA|5.0|This is my favorite of the Pierce Brosnan Bond films... The action is great and not too far-fetced and cheesey like The World Is Not Enough. Michelle Yeoh is awesome in this film... She's the Chinese equivalent to Bond and just adds a lot of flavor to this movie.<br />This is a great DVD to have in your collection, especially since it's very hard to find. In my opinion it is well worth it to purchase this title used.
B0000024JN|5.0|The scene-Preston Hall at the University of South Carolina, Columbia, SC, 1986-87. All the fellas in the dorm have this and you can hear &quot;Brass Monkey,&quot; &quot;The New Style,&quot; &quot;Hold It Now Hit It,&quot; etc. at any given moment. This Cd is all about one thing -FUN! FUN! FUN! Yes, the songs are outrageously stupid and politically incorrect, but the beauty of the Beasties around this time is that they did not pretend to be more than what they were, a bunch of good-hearted jokers enjoying their youth. &quot;I Come form Brooklyn cause that's where I'm from?&quot; (Lyric from &quot;Hold It Now Hit It&quot;), how can you not love something so bad that it's good! Enjoy.
