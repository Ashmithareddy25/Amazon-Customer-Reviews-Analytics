B005CRQ4GU|5.0|I<br />Love<br />This<br />Book I like the part when the seniors come and crash the party it was really funny
1419703692|5.0|A great book with in depth review with Christopher Nolan, plus awesome pictures too. Its a great read if your a fan of The Dark Knight Trilogy.
B00AREIAI8|2.0|It's pretty boring, and I'm really just rating and reviewing to get free gems out of it. But it's not really fun.
B007BFSYMS|4.0|I tried this on my phone and tablet and it works fine on both.  I like ocean sounds personally.  I might use some of the &#34;noise&#34; settings to burn in new earphones.
B007VUA7VO|5.0|Really amazing battery app I use it all the time and I haven't found a single problem I can tell the developers put a lot of work into this app.
B0081SPK0I|4.0|It is on my android phone and tablet.  it works great on both devices.  I, however, am not very skilled to see how well it works at all levels, because I never get there.  It is a pleasant diversion.
B0088RQ4X4|3.0|I enjoyed watching this and will probably do so again. If you like early scifi with modern special effects then it is the show for you.
B00AQ3K8IU|5.0|I am kind of new at the kindle, ereader books but have read several here lately not connecting with many of them. I have to say, Hopeless has touched me enough to actually respond to the \\"Before you go...\\" Never during the whole book did I expect all the twists, turns, and ah-ha moments laid out here Awesome read!!!
B00A0SKFLG|3.0|Well done remake though they changed the locations and the basic story. It really is almost a completely different story with a few similarities. I would have liked it better had they stuck with the original story line.
1581806248|5.0|Love the pictures & descripton, detailed instructions. Have been too busy to try it, but no doubt it's as easy as said.
B009KHDT0C|5.0|If watched as a comedy it does a good job but be able to ignore the innocents being murdered. Watch it.
B008673ZAQ|5.0|I was thoroughly impressed with this book! Just as impressed as I was with the first book in this series.
0307951529|5.0|I have used it as a business guide and recommended it to each of my grown children and several friends.
B00B2V66VS|5.0|takes temple run to a whole new level awsome features deff worth the down load like the first but BETTER
B001MS7IBS|5.0|It's really cool to see how much forshadowing there is in first season.  Really nice packaging, Excellent HD and audio!
B006O6F932|3.0|this was relatively expensive and was very cheaply made.  wouldn't purchase it again.  it was lots of tiny plastic pieces that will be very hard to keep up with
B003TSEEDY|3.0|Don't expect an in depth story. Just about a boy and his feelings. Easy and nice read. Probably good for teenagers.
B000FBFN1U|3.0|My first time reading this series. Exciting but at times too descriptive and get lost with all the characters that are entwined with the main characters.
B00454U1NS|5.0|Pink is a super talented artist.  I love almost everything she's ever done.  You have to dance when listening to this music...
B007XKEY6Q|4.0|I like this app because you can play with friends. lots of people say really mean stuff and can cheat
B003KGBIRK|5.0|This is a superb film, presented impeccably by Criterion Collection. One of David Cronenberg's most transgressive and daring films.<br /><br />Long live the New Flesh!
0670035386|5.0|Classic book! The paper protection cover had some damage but the actual book was in good condition. This is a very cute story for children.
B0054JZC6E|5.0|I love all the games on it it is fun on the go and I twillbe useful for lots of trips
0307454568|5.0|The girl with the dragon tattoo series - Loved this whole series. Would highly recommend it.  A slow start to this one, but in the end it was the best one yet!
B00AO2P3GA|5.0|The best yet<br /><br />This game is awesome I cant stop playing it I love it this game was totally worth 6.99 if you read thiss get it now and start playing I love the graphics the new killstreaks and the campain
B0015DROBO|5.0|Loved loved loved this series. It ended too soon, but that's probably b/c I couldn't put it down. Read it!
B000SW16M6|5.0|&#34;Risky Business&#34; is without a doubt one of the classics from the 80's which I've continued to enjoy many times.  My wife wanted to see all the Tom Cruise movies and Amazon had the best selection.  Highly Recommended.
B007C52NY2|5.0|Stick with it if its slow at first... A little hard to get into the Swedish talk, but once you're hooked, you won't be able to put it down. The third book is a particularly slow start, but turns out the best of them all.
0062124293|5.0|Everyone should read this book. Moran provides an honest, but hilarious account of what goes into &#34;becoming a woman.&#34; For centuries, women have needed a manual to navigate complex double standards and the constant confusion that comes with simply being female. Moran is perfection.
0307949508|5.0|The girl with the dragon tattoo series - Loved this whole series. Would highly recommend it.  Wish there were more to keep going.
B007FRHZ4A|5.0|My son is the number 1 fan of Angry Birds , and he loves to play with this board game so much ! very well designed !!!
B002VPE1B6|5.0|excellente qualiry Avatar (Two-Disc Original Theatrical Edition Blu-ray/DVD Combo) Avatar (Two-Disc Original Theatrical Edition Blu-ray/DVD Combo) Avatar (Two-Disc Original Theatrical Edition Blu-ray/DVD Combo)
B008XNZMOU|5.0|Seriously now.... Can Taylor Swift have a CD that ISN'T any good? She always sounds great in every single CD!
630514415X|5.0|excellentb film you have to see it He Got Game He Got Game He Got Game He Got Game buy
B007HO392S|5.0|This CD ROCKS!! I truly LOVE this CD and am constantly listening to it, have played nothing else since! :)
B00AQ3K8IU|4.0|when i first started it, i thought it was a sappy teenage love story. i liked the authors style and as it progressed, the twists and turns made it a page turner!
B004GHNIRK|3.0|This is not an easy read.  But, it is good to read to compare those times with the current state of society.  Victor Hugo gives insight into the French Revolution, French society before and after the revolution, and religion.  Woven throughout the book is a very interesting story with well developed characters.  Definitely worth the time it takes to read it.
B00B2V66VS|5.0|great sequel to temple run the graphics are better and now there are ziplines and mines! this is awesome this is awesome POWERUPS
B00B2V66VS|3.0|like this game but have had trouble keeping it. it doesn't always open so I have to delete it and do it over.  has happen 3 times now it wont open at all. no problems with other game downloads.
B004T32SOK|5.0|This app works very well and I am able to sync my Tablet, Cell Phone, & Computers to each other and sync to the cloud. Sharing is very simple to do as well. I signed up for the free 5GB and Box ended up giving me lifetime 50GB for free! They also gave me 50GB for a business email address which I will give to my boss and let him use it with his company.<br /><br />I have tried SugarSync, DropBox, JustCloud, & ZumoDrive but I like Box the best because I have more control over my files and its much easier to use. But I do like JustCloud because I can get unlimited storage for $160.00 for 2 years which is the cheapest that I have found so far with unlimited storage.
B0020MKTOS|4.0|Clint Eastwood went into retirement with style.<br /><br />This is one of Eastwood's better films, better in terms of The Bridges of Madison County. Granted, there are slow moments in the movie, but it's a great movie in terms of &#34;reflection&#34;. How one man who grew up in a difficult time, served in the US Armed Forces, and then was belittled by his family and turned aside like an old dish rag, has a remarkable life-changing turn around by befriending who he always considered &#34;the enemy&#34;. Don't worry, I won't spoil the film for you.<br /><br />Worth seeing.
B007JM4CWY|5.0|Cross Me is an addictive and fun game that is well worth the cost for the entertainment it provides. If you enjoy puzzles that require a bit of brain power, it's a great buy, but beware--you won't want to put it down!
B00AQ3K8IU|5.0|Loved this book!! I honestly couldn't put it down. Huge surprise, lots of twists and turns for what I consider a romance novel. Wish it was a series!
B00AFCEIB0|4.0|This is a good app to have, there are just things that I have needed to look up on the Google search engine.
B0018QQQK8|5.0|So romantic! Loved the story of course. I am a sucker for romance so I am allllllll about sparks' books.
B00B2V66VS|5.0|This version is more fun and more challenging then the first. Instead of a couple monkey there is a giant one chasing.  You should definitely get this this game!!! Best ever!!!
B005I6EU48|5.0|Love this case cover for my Kindle Fire! Looks like a vintage leather bound book.  Also, the security of having this cover for my Kindle Fire. When it is on the bookshelf, it looks like a regular book. I really like the look and feel of it.  I would recommend this case cover to anyone who has a Kindle Fire.  I have the red cover. But, they have one in an 'antique tan' color, as well.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|Loved this book, more than the movie. It kept me on my toes wanting to read more. A must read!
B00AREIAI8|5.0|this game is a lot of fun. I am a Orwell lover so if you love horses this is a great app :)
B008IJTFYW|5.0|Very relaxing sounds.  Like how you can choose as many sounds as you like.  Love the rain, thunder and wind combined with the chimes.  Great to meditate by.
0316232955|5.0|Plain and simple, this is the best book I have ever read. I can completely hear Chris Colfer's voice through this entire book. EVERYONE should read this!!!!
0760336954|5.0|A very wide ranging book that both provides a lot of information on the design process in the industry. And it also gives a good picture of the design process and the love that the people involved have for cars.
0393343405|5.0|Easy and fun to read, the author leads us through several centuries of cultural history, interweaving the regimental religious stance of the Catholic Church with the pursuit by the main character of the much freer spiritual and intellectual writings of the ancient Greeks and Romans.
B00571F26Y|4.0|This book will certainly make you think twice about that breakfast cereal you're eating on your latest diet. Could the nutritionists be wrong? Very thought provoking.
B00AQ3K8IU|5.0|This story was great!  Never did I expect the surprise toward the end of the story.  The best part of the story for me was the very last sentence.  It melted my heart!!
B009UX2YAC|2.0|I DO NOT LIKE IT IS DUMB AND HARD MY BROTHER FORCED ME TO DOWNLOAD IT.I WILL STILL PLAY IT BUT NOT AS MUCH AS TEMPLE RUN!!!
B00A3AUGEW|4.0|Good music from Phillip Phillips and it bodes well for future releases.  Some very good songs on the album, and he has a great voice.  I compare him to Dave Matthews a little bit.  His lyrics are good and one of those CD's you can pop in and let it run it course.
B00APUYN0I|5.0|Enjoyed the movie, funny, easy, not complicated, and music was great.  Don't have any thing else to add to this write up.
B000JMLFLW|2.0|I had seen the films, and knew what was going to happen.  This may be part of what bored me about the book, but I just couldn't bring myself to finish it-- I don't normally quit reading a book either.
B009SJ3GUK|4.0|This was a great show with many twist and turns.  It was nice to see old faces (such as the gorgeous, Jessica Lange) and see new faces.<br /><br />I love how AHS kept A LOT of the actors from season 1 and carried them into season 2 but as drastically different types of characters.  The evil minded Tate is now a sweet and mild mannered Kit!<br /><br />There were a few holes in the stories and few stories that ended abruptly as if the writers were bored with that storyline or simply didn't know how to wrap it up.  But it was still a great show!
B004ZZS4CC|4.0|I am really glad I purchased this book.  The mindset of Jaycee Dugard is amazing, and to read her story had me very involved.  A quick and worthwhile read, albeit it difficult at times.
B003O86FMW|4.0|Cannot wait to read the last book. Hope that the movie can keep up. Read this as a ebook on my kindle, pretty nice.
B001993Y2C|5.0|It's BSG! on Blu-Ray! Perhaps the greatest sci-fi series I've ever watched. What more can I say??? Buy it. Now!
B00AMBH70S|3.0|I have seen all the Bourne movies and this one was pretty good but different without Matt Damon as the lead guy.
B000HLDFM2|5.0|One of the greatest films I've ever seen. Up there with SE7EN. Definitely not for the squeamish but it will leave you feeling gut-punched for days after initial viewing!!
B0014D6PCO|5.0|i mean even with an all star cast they turned out to be a joke. This is how batman was supposed to be interpreted, i know there are many sagas of the comics, but the newer ones all have a darker theme to them.
B004FP1WX0|5.0|I actually watched this movie again right after I finished it the first time. I had to absorb every last detail to see how on earth something so bizarre could have happened! This is a must see for anyone who uses social networking!
B0043VDIAG|5.0|Nicholas Sparks is the epitome of romance novels of this generation.  He writes so beautifully of individuals that are drawn to one another through hardship, and enduring love. And even though the stories don't always end &#34;happily ever after&#34;, you can never feel ripped off by the ending because it always seems to be more focused on reality than a fantasy.  I am really looking forward to seeing the movie to see how it compares to the book.  So far I have preferred all the books to the movie interpretations - although I have loved the movies they just haven't quite been able to completely master the way I interpret Nicholas Sparks writings.<br />I highly recommend any and all of Nicholas Sparks books and have encouraged my own daughter to read them - she is as addicted as I am to Nicholas Sparks.
B00632HWOG|1.0|This app takes forever to retrieve the messages from the server and once they're there, good luck opening them to read them without the app getting overwhelmed and closing itself down.
B00AVPYT8I|5.0|Started reading her book. really interesting!!!! just wish i didn't have to buy it so i could read it more.
B004VMUS9G|5.0|This is a great app and the recent upgrade just made it BETTER! I've never had a problem with it :)
B0064X7FVE|5.0|I love the fact that it gives me updates on storms that are coming and flooding. Don't have to go on line to see it.
B008XG1X18|4.0|This is a great app for casual browsing on Pintrest. However, when you're on a really good thread it never fails to crash and close itself.
B000N2HCM4|5.0|This book allows you to see and understand more about this great man we call our President.  This book should be read by young men ever where, he had a clear vision  early on about what he wanted to do in life.  That vision was to Help others more than himself.
B004H1V5RU|4.0|I purchased this level (Epic) first.  I should have started with the standard model.  However, it is still lots of fun.
B0073LWEXK|4.0|I liked this game but I got confused. Even with the map I got confused what to do in winter.
B000FC10WU|3.0|The mystery was good but I thought it took an awful long time for Miss Marple to get involved in solving the crime.
B0067Q42BY|5.0|I HAVE always enjoyed Majhong. I am looking forward to the other games.<br />It has so many levels and each one brings a good challenge.
B00APUQRPC|4.0|Like the relationship part of the movie more than the baseball part.  Reminded me of my aging father.  It was hard to see Clint getting old.
B009UX2YAC|1.0|I don't like it at all it is a waste of time and I think that it is a waste of space Don't buy . It
B00A2IUHM6|5.0|Loved this movie!!  Parts reminded me of my son & his Ted they were unseperable. Definitely adult humor, brought back sweet memories of his childhood.
B00B2V66VS|5.0|This game is a great game and I would recommend it to my friends but it is very addictive and fun at the same time
B004EPYZV2|5.0|Definitely my favorite out of the M:I films.  Action packed, humorous dialogues, interesting plot, all taking place in 3 exotic locations.  There is nothing to dislike about this film.  I am purchasing this one for the home library.
B000LPQ6DE|5.0|loved it!!! this is the best version i have ever seen, the acting is perfect and the scenery is really beautiful.
0547884591|5.0|This is way more than I bargained for ---- I mean that sincerely and not sarcastically. This guy goes over the steps from hunting it to eating it and everything in between. Too bad I can't put it on Kindle and carry both on my hunting trips.
B004LROUNG|4.0|Good story.  I got a little lost about why the characters were doing what they were doing.  Once I got closer to the end of the story it all came together.
B0012E6R3W|5.0|Awesome album, great thrash metal for  the 2000's. Arrived before expected time . Cd packaged extremely well from its journey from the states to australia.
B0095ZMMCK|5.0|As always, Tom Clancy brings us a whopper of a book, interesting & thought provoking.  It certainly makes you wonder what is actually going on behind the scenes of which we know nothing.  A big read!.
B0097EWK3A|5.0|I played this game for hours. It is very detailed and alot of fun! I can't wait for the second part
0307352145|5.0|Refreshing to read something that understands introverts and even compliments their contributions to life. And even though you may not want them, there are tips on surviving in an extrovert world.
B008AK8FHM|4.0|I really enjoyed this book, but it left me with more questions than answers. This is a good thing for me. It was thought provoking. I believe that Dr. Alexander will write more on this topic after he &#34;processes&#34; the information longer.
B006MW3V6U|5.0|Very good story and great acting make this an exceptional series to watch. I think many people will enjoy this one. It may take watching two shows, and this is the second season, to get into the story.
B0082Z1CVQ|5.0|This book just makes me smile!  Perfect for light reading.  You won' t regret getting this cute book.  Read it, you' 'll love it.
B007EECSFA|5.0|This was one of the best books I have ever read.  It kept my interest and had a surprising ending.
B001OQCV6A|3.0|I real good remake of an old story. I seen this in theater and really enjoyed it. I purchased this as a gift for Christmas for a family member.
B009XY97VC|5.0|Since I got Archangel, I've been a big fan of Two Steps from Hell, and this one doesn't disappoint.  I has great themes as always and excellent production quality.
B002VKE1K2|3.0|This is probably the best one of the few that are out there. Its what started the hole ghost/paranormal movies. Its good, I will say when i watched it the first time in theaters I was scared to go to bed alone that night. Paranormal Activity is surely one you want to have in your collection.
B0046B8GEQ|5.0|My son is 10 months and he doesn't really have any favorite cartoon characters. At home we don't really watch T. V.  But at times, I do surf cartoon channels to see if anything catches his attention. Never, he goes on his way exploring elsewhere. His sitter would tell me constantly how he LOVED this particular movie. She went on to say, he will sit there and watch it and laugh. I believed her but not to that extent. So, finally I bought the movie. I couldn't believe it. My son abousolutely LOVES this movie!!!  I LOVE this movie!!! Great choice baby boy.
B004PAHZMC|5.0|My 11 year old nephew loved it! He picks up his legos and brings his creations everywhere. He just turned 13 and passed it to his 3 year old brother. This product is great since the two of them used it and it was still in great condition.
B003DT19F0|5.0|I purchased this movie for my 4 year old God-daughter to watch while she was visiting.  Being just 4 years old we watched it many times during her two day stay.  I ended up loving it as much as she did.  The story is compelling without being too frightening. All the characters are well thought out.  The animation is beautiful and enchanting.  It is a perfect movie.
B009RI4FRU|1.0|Not worth your time.  First of all I was expecting a lot more from the combo of Willis and Murray.  What a combo, but they didn't do anything. I turned this off after an hour and much deliberation of whether or not this movie was worth watching more of. This movie was a fantasy trip of someones idea of first love.  Please do not let your children watch it, its really not for kids, let alone adults.  I tend to believe that this movie represents an adult's fantasy about childhood first love than anything else.  I couldn't bear to watch it past the scene where two eighth graders get \\"married\\".
B00992CF6W|5.0|I love the game but it takes to much time to find a game I have not gotten into one I try it over and over and I give up I have 4 wifi bars other then that this game is great
B0089EHWQE|5.0|Couldn't put it down!  What a great read! The characters were alive and the story line gripping and the ending surprising
B00B2V66VS|5.0|This app is awesome!! The graphics are really cool and much better than the first one. MUST GET! :) There are new obsticles like a zipline, mine, rivers, and more!! Also, instead of a bunch of little monkeys chasing you, there is one giant one. And those who have problems downloading it probably want the apps fault: re-start your kindle. Not too long story short: Get this app!!!!
B008EEB4TA|3.0|At times it's way too poppy but good light dance music. really bad lyrics but it's more of a guilty pleasure.
B008MF3OEY|4.0|I currently use the [[ASIN:B006ZCBN9E red]] version of this case. It is a great case with an authentic book feel. It's nice, but I wanted something prettier. I figured this case would be a good choice.<br /><br />While it's not a bad case, there is something about it that is just not quite as nice as the other case. It has a little less weight to it and the partial leather finish seems a little fake.<br /><br />The non-Kindle holding side of the case has a pocket. There is no stylus loop, but you can fit a small stylus in the \\"spine\\" of the case, although it won't be secure. The Kindle is held in place by the standard elastic on each corner. Where the Verso differs slightly from other cases is the placement of the elastic. It isn't on the outermost edge like most cases, but slightly pulled in. I don't think this adds or removes security; it seems mostly aesthetic although it did make the Kindle easier to install.<br /><br />My only other criticism of this case is that it can be tricky to get it to stand if you want to use it in a hands free mode. It can be done, but it's not super stable and takes a little bit of work. Also, you may not get the viewing angle you want. I guess in fairness, this is made to look like an old book, not an old TV.<br /><br />While the cover is designed for the Kindle Fire, it also works on other devices. Here is the list from the packaging: Kindle Fire, Kindle Keyboard, NOOK, Kobo Wi Fi, Kobo Touch, Kobo Vox, Sony Reader Daily Edition, Sony Reader Wi-Fi, Blackberry Playbook, Samsung Galaxy Tab, HTC Flyer, Dell Streak 7, and more.
B001HNE3NO|5.0|The book presents parallel related story lines set in contemporary time and the holocaust time. The plot revolved around the impact / mistreatment of the Jews in France and how France tried to sweep it and not claim responsibility for the atrocities. The story is original and nicely ties together yesterday and today. It was extremely well written - and - I could not put it down. I saw the film last year (independent movie) and loved it for its characters and story line.
B005K0HDGE|5.0|Thrilling, exciting time travel book. Stephen King does it again with a wonderful book that leaves you wanting more from it.
B00B2V66VS|4.0|the game is much better than the original but most of the time doesn't open after going to home and reopening it. at least on kindle fire u have restart the whole friggin system. they will probably fix soon though and I still recommend it to everyone.
B0045XICB2|4.0|I expected to get the blu-ray that's got extras but I got this movie-only version instead. It was a mistake on my part so it's ok. I like the movie regardless.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|Great app lots of fun to play the horses are cute and you get to do many things with your horse
B008673ZAQ|5.0|Liked just as much as bared to you. Preordered 3rd book of series. Definitely didn't rush the writing. The 50 shades series , the author was lacking in the last book . Seemed to be rushing to the end ! Sylvia doesn't lack any detail !!! Can't wait for \\" Entwined \\"<br />New reader
B001ANYDAO|4.0|Many people are wrapped around the myths and stereotypes of successful people - thinking people are born with these natural talents. Malcolm Gladwell attacks these myths and stereotypes giving the reader an insight look to what it really means to be successful. At the end of the day it boils down to hard work, opportunity, and culture background. Nothing is free in this world and takes more than brains to be successful in life.<br /><br />I give this book 4 out of 5 stars because not every outlier story grabbed my attention. I think their are enough outlier stories were the reader can relate to one of them, if not all. I defiantly have a different outlook on life after reading this book, it answered many of questions and myths that surround society. I recommend everyone give it a chance, it may motivate you to do more with your life.
B007M45PMU|4.0|catchy hooks, folky, rocking music. I quite like this album. Having not listened to this album before buying, like I would on other players, and being significantly less expensive, I would say all signs point to pretty great buy.
B000O8OTNC|4.0|This little tool works out great. I attached it to my key chain/carabiner so it goes where I go. It made my knives so sharp that I accidentally cut myself on one of them. Which is actually how I figured out that this product did the job right! I've had it for a few months and I sharpen my knife(s) at least bi-weekly to retain sharpness when I don't have my stones and it's still going strong!<br />One thing I didn't like, is that when I used the ceramic side, it life a little lip down the blade of the knife. I rubbed my finger across the blade and it didn't feel as sharp as it should have been, but it was still very sharp (paper test).<br />Other than that, awesome product!
B004YW4L5K|5.0|i love tis book it is such a great look into the different religions of the world and how they haver changed with people moving around the world and technology. beyond that the story is so well written. it does have its slow moments and moments where you can get kind of lost trying to remember who each of the gods is but just keep going it all makes sense at some point and is so worth it in the end.
B000O8OTNC|2.0|So the parcel arrived and, product package unopened, it is quite evident that the carbide sharpeners are some oxidised, as there is noticeable discolouration in the middle, close to the edges. I was unaware that carbide could oxidise, but apparently it can. Perhaps the warehouse from where this was shipped has poor climate controls, or otherwise high humidity? In any case, I am reluctant to open the package, as I am not yet certain if I want to get my money back. Is carbide still good even oxidised? Will have to look into it, anyhow. =(
B00AQ3K8IU|4.0|I'm not typically into young adult fiction but this book hooked me from the beginning. The characters were well written and there was just enough suspense to keep me turning pages.<br />I've already recommended it to several friends.
B00AQ3K8IU|5.0|I was a little hesitant to get this book at first, but when i got it i couldn't put it down! It only took me 2 days to read this book because i just couldn't set it down! The plot and characters are amazing and just when you think you know whats going to happen something else happens that you would of never of guessed. LOVE THIS BOOK!!! Defiantly worth the money paid!!
B00B2V66VS|3.0|It is a fun game. but I went to play it today and it will not allow me to play the game. Any suggeststions as to why it wont let me?
0316228532|1.0|I had very much prepared myself for the fact that this book would be nothing like Harry Potter, and was even excited about a totally different genre, and more grown up subject matter, however, I did hope that JK's target audience would bear an ever so slight resemblance to her Harry Potter crowd. I was hoping that those, like myself, who were 12 when they started Reading Harry, and grew up with the book would be the ones whom the book was written for; no longer 12, but still in love with the characters we grew up adoring.<br />This was not the case at all for this book. I didn't connect with even one of the characters and found myself repulsed by much of the content. I'm honestly surprised that I made it through the book seeing as I almost closed it for good several times. Maybe it is the type of book for some, but anyone who loved Harry Potter would hate this book.
B001N1DPDE|4.0|The BK2 went away from the smooth coating of the earlier 2nd gen models and back to (I'm told) what was on the first gen models. This rough coating is said to be more durable than the smooth coating.<br />Unfortunately they also did away with the stamping: &#34;BK-2&#34; on one side  and &#34;BK&KA-BAR USA&#34; on the other...now it is part of the coating (gold over black).This looks nice, and is fine if you want a Safe Queen, but I had planned to remove the coating and do a forced patina so I would MUCH rather the legend was stamped into the blade. Now If I remove or wear the coating away so too goes the KA-BAR and USA legend off the blade.<br />Still a great knife but I had to deduct 1 star for the stamp change.
B00ATDOVNK|4.0|I love the game. The hints and map were very helpful. The hidden objects were just the right amount of difficulty to keep it interesting.
B00AIQP9DE|5.0|super fun game! really addictive. I didn't stop playing till I beat it. worked great on my kindle fire. I recommend getting it.
B00B2V66VS|5.0|Good game very addicting but I bought something with the diamonds and it shut down the app then it said I have  -1 diamonds.

B003DTMUOE|2.0|Si nos has leido temas de superacion personal, entonces puedes empezar por este libro. La calidad literaria del alquimista es pobre pero puedes empezar por aqui, sugiero no tomar muy en serio al autor quien la mayor parte de la trama idealiza al extremo. No planeo volver a leer temas de este autor.
B0091REZMW|5.0|I think everyone would enjoy this game I will reccomend it to my friends for sure!! I sure do like it
B008AYA7WE|4.0|Older style game, but challenging. At first its seems very easy. Next thing you know. The speed increases and your still at level 1.
B002M9WW30|5.0|Perfecto, a buen precio. Entrega en 18 dias. Todo genial. Feliz con mi compra. Seguro seguire comprando muchas cosas mas.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|My 7 year old Granddaughter got me hooked on this game. I even play it on break at work collecting the coins needed to get a new character she wants
B002BWP49C|5.0|Feliz de que envien a mi pais. Sobre todo el empaque y el tiempo de entrega. Fue mas rapido de lo que esperaba.
B00B2V66VS|5.0|I think this game is AMESOME be some times when I jump I die so that stinks but other then that I really like this game
B0062P3392|3.0|Note: May contain spoilers. Proceed with caution.<br /><br />I'm having a hard time figuring out a way to start this. As the title suggests I was expecting something totally different when I watched Killer Elite the other day. It's not that it was bad, I just think I might have gotten this confused with another movie when I picked it up at the video store.<br /><br />The film wastes no time in throwing you into the action when about five minutes in we reach our first firefight. This segment manages to set up the back story of the film. We have Danny Bryce (Jason Statham) that wishes to get out of the hitman business. Unfortunately that doesn't last long when he finds out that his partner Hunter (Robert De Niro) is being held captive. In order to free his former partner Danny must complete the job that Hunter failed to accomplish. It might have been a good story if it had been a little more coherent, but sadly it felt like it went all over the place.<br /><br />For me it felt like the director put more focus on the action than he did on constructing a proper plot. So in that regard I guess you can say he accomplished his goal. There's a lot of action sequences in here and almost all of them are pretty intense. However they do start to lose some of their flare once you reach the halfway mark. Plus the camera work on this film is pretty awful at times. You'll occasionally reach a few segments that look more like a blur than an actual scene.<br /><br />The best thing about this film is its cast, or I should say it's main cast. On the forefront you have Jason Statham, Robert De Niro, and Clive Owen. While Statham is the one who appears most in the film, Clive Owen has some pretty frequent scenes and he makes his presence notable. Overall the acting was well done, I just feel like it would have been more enjoyable to watch had they gotten a better script.<br /><br />Finally, the sound on this is extremely irritating. All the dialogue sequences sound like a whisper and they almost always cut into a very loud action sequence right after. I was constantly turning the volume up and then lowering it down a few minutes later. I don't know about you, but when I have to do that while watching the film it bugs the living hell out of me. I just want to watch it, I shouldn't have to be fiddling with the remote every five minutes.<br /><br />Overall Score: 6/10 - I really wanted to enjoy this film, but in the end it was kind of lackluster. Whether it's because I picked up the wrong film I don't know, but even if I picked up the right movie I still think I wouldn't have been too satisfied with what I watched. The only really interesting thing about this movie is that it's supposedly based on a true story. Other than that it's just another action flick that relies too heavily on violence without using it to form some kind of proper story. Oh well.
B009YP9L7U|5.0|Familiar tale with twists the whole way. Phenomenal writing. Hard to put down. Filled with details and surprises, never what you think.
B000069HJN|5.0|Love this album,bought this album when it came out,just blew me away.This was the post R.H.era,even though I missed his contributions to this album,I thought the boys did a splendid production.Rick Davies &#34;Ever open Door&#34; , is a song that reminds me of &#34;Downstream&#34; from Fools Overture,beautiful melody and lyrics.I'm so glad that I found this album.
B007Z9RAX4|5.0|This girl should've been on the movie Kick-Ass, because she kicked everyones ass that crossed her, but the ending was lousy!!

B0044C3RB4|5.0|I am in the process of Fringe withdrawal.  You can cure me with one, two or perhaps three more episodes of Fringe. I know it's not over, because how did walter mail a letter from 2167 to Peter in 2015? And the way Peter looked after he seen the tulip. Please make a movie and clear that and other question us fans may have. Thanks from Lucky Charmer!!
B004VQK9XW|5.0|Great Tracks to get you moving and singing at all times of the day! Nikki Sixx and the rest of the guys sound GREAT!
B000ICKPOQ|5.0|I love all of the Stargate shows. SG-1 set it off and it was so awesome that two more shows and two movies were made. It broke my heart when all of them ended. There is no Stargate program on TV so I watch them on my Roku. Farewell to arms!!! I salute you.
B007RXRSEY|5.0|Slash & Myles are freakin' awesome!! This MP3 is the bomb diggity!! I belt out each and every song when I have it playing! LOVE LOVE LOVE!!!

B00AQ3K8IU|5.0|A heartfelt story with amazing  revelations as the story progresses.<br />A chilling ending which stayed in my mind for days after. What started out as a girl meets boy story evolved into twists and turns to hold any readers attention
B000Y0Q5NM|5.0|Great show. Next time you go through the gate - give me a call and I will happily gear up!!!  : )
B00B2V66VS|1.0|When you download it take for ever and when you play it you can't even play the game so you should not get the game
B00119ZMKW|5.0|Corin you did a nice job filling in for Michael Shanks while he was good. This was one of the best shows to be a fill-in.
B000HZGOUI|4.0|This is an awesome movie with great actors. You can never go wrong with this movie. It never gets old for me, i can watch it over n again.
B004Z2TUGE|3.0|This movie had some good action and plot, but I was disappointed in the ending. It was the typical syfy movie with teenagers.
B000001FDK|5.0|Grease soundtrack has great music.  It was a fun movie and enjoy the music for it.  Can listen over and over again.
B0038P59A0|5.0|I have always loved Sherlock Holmes with Basil Rathbone, however, when I saw it with Robert Downey, Jr.and Jude Law, I f eel in love again with the character, Holmes. It is a delight to see Robert back to work, I forgot how wonderful of an actor Robert truly is.  I look forward to the next Sherlock Holmes movie.

B001FVV2X2|5.0|I'm so sorry that it went off the air. I actually turned the TV to the Fox channel looking for it Friday at 9pm. It sure left a gap in my psyche because that show raised the bar and there is nothing, at the moment, that can reach that height!! Can they make another show that make all your senses and intellect stand up and take notice? Good luck with that!!

B002WJI63A|4.0|This item is well sewn and super soft. A great item for my little girl's Super Mario Collection. Sized to fit her pre-tween hands and great fun.
B009IEXKXI|4.0|A fun, spacey, McGyver meets Apollo 13 survival fest.  Easy to read, hard to put down, grounded and amusing.  I would recommend this book to anyone looking for a light scifi read without too much whimsical fantasy.
B003405MF6|5.0|it seems like jeff beck has been making music forever. his guitar work is as good as ever, he hasn't missed a beat. an eclectic collections of tunes including &#34;Over The Rainbow&#34;. If you ever saw him perform this live, you will become a fan if you were'nt one already.
B00B2V66VS|5.0|This game is the best game in the world!!!!! Way better then the first one. Which is still awesome!!!! This is a super fun game..sometimes hard but you can easily adapt to the difficulty

B00ATDOVNK|5.0|This is an awesome and very addicting game! Can easily spend hours on it figuring out the mini games and puzzles.
B004O3YGMC|5.0|Works brilliantly, everyone should get a copy. It also worked very well when I used it in New Hampshire, it is that good.
B007IK44CK|2.0|Just watched Mission Impossible Ghost Protocol and the Apple and BMW product placement couldn't have looked more out of place if they tried. I want to like Ghost Protocol but it's so rife with product placement that it's basically unbearable.
B003LXSY60|5.0|the songs are so raw and addictive!! in my opinion their best album!<br />if you still have any doubts about buying this cd, don't, you won't regret, they are great!
B00AREIAI8|5.0|This game is really fun because I get my own little pony and its cute.<br />They are you can get out of school but I don't have to be a girl who u can't see it is a weirdo and I don't have the prince of school we have a boyfriend is the fifth kid is this is a weirdo to the same school
B009CPJHY4|5.0|Thoroughly enjoyed the movie.  The characters were interesting and delightful.  I especially loved Judi Dench and Maggie Smith.  I will want to see it again.
B004GYY714|5.0|Wnen I found this app, I discovered the police and fire calls for the local area and listen to it as I am reading or playing games.  It keeps me aware of what is going on near me.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|I don't have a sd card on my kindle and I hate because and my name is Brooke and I'm 7 years old
B002MQYOFW|5.0|Fantastic!  I hope their journey continues and Suzanne Collins delivers us another fine read.<br />J. K. Rowling has some competition now!
B00AREIAI8|5.0|this game is quite fun. I have only had the game a little while and am enjoying it very much.
B006DRVFRQ|5.0|does what i need it to in a simple and intuitive manner<br /><br />it is a solid app that the devs have obviously put a lot of work into
B002MQYOFW|4.0|It is one of my favorite books if only took me a few day to read because I couldn't put it down
B00A11AN6O|3.0|I was thinking a file transfer and sharing app ... but has limited uses for me . . . . .
B000JMKQX0|3.0|I was intrigued by the attention this book received. I now know why. It is a collection of very short stories presented as chapters. The pace of the book is fast because of this even though the stories themselves are not. It plays to the short attention span of most 'mericans.  There are a few interesting philosophical and political points but this book is mainly just for entertainment only. Good for a weekend getaway or a night of insomnia.
B0052RDHTM|2.0|While I am enjoying the book very much but because of its length ( and a deadline for book club)  I paid the extra for whispersync...what a mistake  while it worked correctly the first few times it hasn't worked right in awhile..Five calls to Audible.com customer service still no resolution...don't waste your money on Whispersync!!!!
B00A23MYCC|4.0|Ted is a raunchy, funny movie that tugs at your heart a couple of times. Definitely different acting from Mark Wahlberg.
1609419693|5.0|Tina Fey makes you laugh, makes you think,and makes you laugh again! Read it and pass it on.  It went through me and then my girls then my girlfriends and their children.  Great to enjoy, great to enjoy again when others read.
B001N18HMS|5.0|I was at first worried about purchasing a used vinyl, but I bought it anyways for my boyfriend. He absolutely loves the empyrean but adores the cover art too. This vinyl came I perfect shape like the seller said,  \\"like new\\". It came fast and really well packaged! Will totally buy from seller again!
B004OZOTSQ|1.0|I like to watch movies on my tablet.  Rather than constantly removing the 32GB micro SD card, I thought I'd try to use this product.  The free version said my ~1GB files were too big and that I need to buy the \\"PRO\\" version to copy files this big.<br /><br />I bought the PRO version and now when I try to transfer a large file I get a \\"Server Error\\" so it's completely useless for my needs.<br /><br />IMHO: Android OS should have the ability to natively copy files either wirelessly or through a cable.
B000JMKQX0|5.0|I avoided reading this book because too many people had recommended it...and I didn't believe it could live up to they hype.<br /><br />I was wrong.<br /><br />Very well written, great flow, kept me locked in the whole way and caused me to keep thinking back long after I'd finished.<br /><br />Thank you Max Brooks.
B002PXFYLU|5.0|A good translation. I read Meditations 2 - 3 times every year and have gifted copies to many friends, colleagues and former students.
B00280LYHS|5.0|It was a great book<br />I loved it<br />Best book ever<br />Great storyline<br />The best<br />Awesome book<br />Best book ever
B00992CF6W|5.0|I forgot my password on my account on the computer, and I'm so glad that. Mojang came out with this. The first time I played this, I was addicted and favorited it.  I think it's a lot better of a deal. It is more than 4 times cheaper and don't have to deal with the password stuff.
B00B2V66VS|3.0|it is awsome when you play it but when you exit by pressing the home button you cant get in well at least on my kindel fire not HD but anyway AWSOME (at least when you actualy play)
B00B2V66VS|3.0|I have this app on my phone and I love it a lot.  I was very excited that I could get it on my kindle. I played a couple games but then went to a different game. when I tried to access it again, it crashed. I kept trying but it wouldn't work. I am deleting this app on my kindle but it works perfectly fine on my iphone
B009NQKXYK|4.0|Highly recommended for any sci-fi movie buff. Great performances, fantastic scenery, two thumbs up. We saw this in the theater and had to watch it again!
B00992CF6W|3.0|it needs more stuff like water and lava buckets also needs endermea plus the ability to sprint other than thatis a good game
B00B2V66VS|3.0|I have had a few problems with this game. Sometimes the tilting calibration fails on me and second problem is the scenery never loads officially so it forces me to die. I seriously like the first one better, but this one is free so try it out and you may or may not agree with me. I say you are better off with the first one.
B004JN1D2I|2.0|This series of book is so intricate there are websites dedicated to placing all characters.<br /><br />The first book is great. The whole series crumbles under its own weight. There doesn't seem to be any final goal. The final book ends with a chapter that promises to bring back forgotten characters to life, but the series nonetheless feels a lot to be desired. This series was started with no clear final picture and oftentimes feels like a set of disjoint, single-character stories.
B009YP9L7U|3.0|It is a good book to read during stressful times.  Light and easy reading.  Don't have to think much :-)
B0070Y46UY|2.0|Is it a dream ? Plausible or pure unreal fiction ? A survival story that leaves to be desired at the end. After reading the book I decided not to go watch the movie.
B009ZQC7MY|5.0|The HD made it seem like they were right there.  Such fantastic resolution!  Love the series; it's historically accurate, takes place in a real castle estate (which has its own fascinating history); acting is superb and storyline so well done.  I'd give it more stars if I could!  This does not disappoint!
B0085RQLXK|5.0|Wasn't dissappointed. Been waiting for New Aerosmith songs, \\"Music from Another Dimension\\" has new songs with the Classic Sound of Aerosmith. I got the \\"Bonus Package\\" which includes 3 more songs & Live Video Performances & Interviews.
B002V0GZ9M|5.0|great movie to watch on a cold winter day.<br />Recommend this movie to anyone needing a smile.<br />Love the cast!
B00B2V66VS|4.0|I love the app a lot except for one thing... it will not let me play it sometimes. It's a great app otherwise.
B005LAIHR2|1.0|What a heaping pile of crap... Don't even bother renting this like I did... The final nail has been driven into the rock n' rolls coffin... This waste of two hours saw to that...
B00632HWOG|2.0|I updated to this version of Yahoo and wasn't happy with it. Could not see anywhere to log out, which meant Yahoo I was constantly logged in on my Kindle.  older version was better.
B000FCKGPC|5.0|Once again Martin delivers... As always whose gonna die next, wonderful intrigue and surprises.  And what's up with Jon snow.... When's he gonna bite it?
B0063IH60K|5.0|I can't get enough of solitaire.  love it.<br /><br />I have been playing this game for as long as I can remember. never get tired of it.
B000NY12LO|5.0|I adore Jodi Picoult, but this book ASTONISHED me. The book touches on so many topics that high schoolers and everyone in general can relate to: bullying, depression, self-doubt. I adore the characters and the storyline in general. In fact, I'm not sure how to review this without being a spoiler. I assure you that this book will not fall short of your expectations. Picoult manages to once again shock the world with her writing on current issues with lovable characters that you can truly understand and sympathize with. Simply amazing. Buy. Read. Now. Recommend to EVERYONE. READ IT.
B007BFSYMS|2.0|Not great.. the app would crash the Motorola Electrify when using the timer. Lots of interesting sounds. Had to uninstall after trying the sleep timer..
B006LSZECO|5.0|This book was so great.  Kept my attention and I couldn't put it down!!!!!  Will definitely read more by this author.
B001WCN232|5.0|This is probably my favorite album by the Rolling Stones.I don't think it was the most popular one by them,but its my favorite.
B002OMZTSK|5.0|This book is fantastic. Purely amazing. I loved every minute of it. The hardships that Russel had to go through I can totally relate.
B006MW3UZW|4.0|I would have given this series a 5. but it does drag a little in places.<br />I think the actors are well suited for the roles they play.  I actually hate Thomas, and am not very fond of O'Brien and the new maid.<br />The scenery is spectacular.  The photography is extremely well done.  The costumes are authentic as far as I can tell. The writers weave the different concurrent stories together flawlessly, and keep coming up with surprise twists that I could not see coming.  The director and crew turn the series into a first class production.
B0052RDHTM|5.0|I read Follett's previous trilogy about the middle ages and enjoyed the series immensely. This is the first of his next trilogy and the style has been retained. Very enjoyable reading. I look forward to the next two books.
B0097NGUJG|5.0|An Awesome Wave comes at you with an amazing variety of sounds and textures. Alt-J seems to pull from a musical dimension that somehow blends Neutral Milk Hotel, Underworld, and shades of Modest Mouse.  This sucker-punch of awesome sound delivered to your nads of musical appreciation is worth picking up just to hear what music CAN be if nothing else.
B008Y2FRFO|5.0|fun for all big and small. entertains for a little while or for a long time. like the waiting rooms when bored yo death. love it.
B0037EAJAC|5.0|This movie was recommended by a friend. It is truly a great work. It transports  you back to feudal Japan and does a great job at not sugar coating some of life's realities.
B007IXWKUK|5.0|I love this book and can't wait to start the next book.  This book is really a must read. Great
B0013D6LEM|5.0|Of course it gets 5 stars. One of the most influential albums of the last 50 years. The soundtrack of my middle/high school years.
B0063IH60K|2.0|The Solitaire game by MobilityWare is fine, but I did not know it was going to have constant add when you start a new game.  I will stop using it because of the anoying adds.
B007IXWKUK|5.0|The second book in this wonderful trilogy had me dreaming of sex. It was so hot. I really appreciated getting to know Mr. Grey's background and his reasons for being the way he is. I don't want this erotica to end but on to the next :)
B00AW8UK0K|3.0|The concept of the 5:2 diet is explained well in the BBC Horizon program as well as this article ([...]) in BBC. I follow it and I think it is really path breaking approach. But in my opinion, the book is more like a prolonged article with food plans attached with. So I think 10 EUR for buying this book is too much.
B00B2V66VS|4.0|This game has great graphics and my chldren love plaiying this game.  This game makes you not want to stop playing; you always want to see if you can get further.
B009FZHYKU|5.0|SeasOn 3 of WD is easily, thus far, my favorite.  Unexpected twists, turns and deaths keep pulling up in this post-apocalyptic thriller.  I gave this 5 stars, but in reality it is so much mOre.  If like me you are relatively new to the WD franchise using Amazon to catch up on season 3 is effortless and wonderful.
B004MC8CA2|4.0|I like how you can get different versions and it makes it easier to read and understand. I like having alot of options with this app.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|my 6 year old loves it and gives it 5 stars I would give it 4 it is very fun but takes to long to earn gems and coins
B000W9DSVW|4.0|I loved all these movies and it was great to find them all together and the price was a great price, couldn't pass up.
B0098A1TEE|5.0|I haven't had much time to listen critically to this, but I have enjoyed what I have listened to. I think I'm really going to like this, but if I change my mind, or have further comment, I'll amend this review.
B005LAIHY0|4.0|Bought this movie as a Christmas stocking gift.  Person recieving this movie enjoyed getting, watched movie too and pretty good, plus the price of the movie was priced just right for my pocket book...
B008S0IJAM|5.0|Nice album and solid artist. Right up my line. I've added this to my player and I think she is going to be one of my permanent artists to look for.
B008X9Z37A|5.0|Fits great, can stand up and watch movies.  Nice texture and very sturdy.  This was a very good buy for me.
B0063GORYU|5.0|I love this app! I can play it any time. Great for when I have nothing to do. And don't need wi fi! I take it with me to work and play on my lunch hour.
B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|I get get enough of it. Love the complications of change that the characters must face after World War I.
B002I0J5FG|5.0|I think he deserves it for the reason that I get when expected and as we saw in the pictures and works as expected
B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|This series captivated the viewer with a peek into the mid-level aristocracy. Fascinating, character-driven, great story lines. I enjoy this series very much.
B002ZG98UK|5.0|I think he deserves it for the reason that I get when expected and as we saw in the pictures and works as expected
B008NB0SQO|5.0|We had this on dvd but wanted it on blueray so I bought it.  It is one our favorite Christmas movies.  The only problem with the movie is they cut out one song in the dvd and blueray that was in the vhs format and it ruins that scene because you don't understand why Scrooge is crying.  Come on Disney, put the song back in and let the movie make sense again.
B000002J1U|4.0|The songs on this are Immigrant Song, Friends, Celebration Day, Since I've Been Loving You, Out On The Tiles, Gallows Pole, Tangerine, That's The Way,  Bron-Y-Aur Stomp,  Hats Off To (Roy) Harper<br />This one is not my favorite Zeppelin. I like Immigrant song, Since I've Been Loving You, but then the other songs are changing and moving away from the blues and going into a different style for me. Like Tangerine. When I first heard it, I love the song but didn't know it was Zeppelin and was happy to buy the album with all these new songs.  That's the Way was good, but I wanted more rock.
B005LAIHZY|4.0|This is a good movie and very enjoyable but it doesn't come up the to standards of &#34;UP&#34; and other pixar movies.  Still, very much worth watching and owning.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|I love My Horse! The horse is just so realistic. It is fun to train, pet, and feed it. I highly recommend getting this app, especially if you love horses!
B00A3NQNUU|4.0|Rather hard to earn gems, but fun just the same. I like the tips you get while you are waiting for the game to load
B00AQ3K8IU|5.0|Very captivating book, draws you in the start and keeps you drawn in, very interesting and beautiful love story.<br />Some parts are very deep and disturbing, others will make you laugh out loud, and cry.
B00ABGEFWC|5.0|I love it! Its a great game to me! And it works great on my Kindle Fire. I give it 5 stars.
B005CRQ4OW|5.0|Great book<br /> I recommend the book for people who like a good book. I recommend it for all people who have a sense of humor
B00B2V66VS|3.0|every time I go to start the program it acts like it wants to than shuts down and goes back to my home screen but when I did her to play it I loved the graphic
B00B2V66VS|2.0|Nice looking app but does not work on nabi. Swipe motions stop after first 30 seconds. Looks like original with some neat new stuff. Wish it worked.
B00A8SPNYW|4.0|This game is very good for the mind.. my only suggestion would be to give Hints if a person gets stuck.
B004GYY714|5.0|Tune has many great story of Mus ie and some of my stations I grew up with and it is good to always listen to great music.
B008Y2FRFO|4.0|The game is cool but I wish it provided more coins in 30 seconds.  it is a slow paced game that is fun if a person is winning.  Need to provide more coins.
B009N1HUIC|5.0|This preview provided me the opportunity to see if I really wanted to watch the whole movie, which I did. Thanks.
B003JTHXOK|5.0|Romance, suspense, and a great story.  It's a really good quick read. It's a lot like sleeping with the enemy!
B008BM0IUG|5.0|I am not an author, writer or a physicist. Therefore I am not going to review like such. I found this book very informal, interesting and a very good angle on certain areas of particle physics, in particular the Higgs. I enjoy we'll written and well rounded books like this and if your are a wanna be egg head like me you will love it. Ronny
B005K0HDGE|5.0|Wow, what an awesome book - can't put it down. I don't usually read Stephen King but i'm going to look at more of his books.
B00APUYN0I|1.0|all the best parts were in the \\"trailer\\". I throughly detest \\"toilet\\" and/or \\"vomit\\" humor.  I left the room after the same girl projectile vomitted the 2nd time.  friends tell me she did it another 2 or 3 times after I left.  A terrible \\"Glee\\" wanna-be.  wish there was a way to give it ZERO STARS, to match the number of Stars that were in this movie-
B003MOHX8S|5.0|I am really into this type of music.  This album is everything I would have hoped for.  Worth your time and investment.
B006LSZECO|5.0|Start s  off slow and boring but gets to very interesting turns and twists and the ending is so very unexpected.
B007IXWKUK|5.0|What an amazing book.  It has gotten a bad rep as pornography, but it is more about feelings, relationships, healing, empathy and so much more.  I loved all 3 books of the trilogy.  I laughed and cried throughout.  This author has a great future ahead of her and I look forward to more of her books.  I would rate it much higher than a five if I could.  Expect to not be able to put it down and get very little sleep while reading all 3 books of the trilogy.
B008EKOO46|5.0|I have read each of Jared Diamond's books.  He again delivers outstanding insight in The World Until Yesterday, just as with his books Collapse and Guns, Germs, and Steel.  Nobody delivers currently relevant information from the world of anthropology, that we can use to improve our own society, like Diamond.  If our politicians would put aside their petty disputes and small thinking, and consider and use the information and analysis in this book to guide policy changes, we could live in a much better world.
B008MG1E4A|5.0|I have just started reading this book, so far it is a really good book. I highly recommend reading this book
B00AREIAI8|5.0|I love hourses and this game is the funny est gamei have so much fun. best yourself horse game ever ever
B008673ZAQ|5.0|If you like 50 shades these books are excellent to go along with it. I finished reading them in 2 days. I could not put them down
B007N5YIUS|3.0|Of course I SHOULD be ogling over it but I'm not. Sorry, all Angry bird fans. I'm not loving it. I liked angry bird when it was angry bird. Now i don't. I only have the teaser free version - which i'm thankful for or it would have been a waste of money. I'm just not thrill about this.
B007BFSYMS|5.0|Good noises, little odd to hear colors but there ya go :-)  I never knew violet had a sound until now.
B009MCRHH6|5.0|MY FAVORITE GAME THIS YEAR! and thats a lot to say since the year just started. I really love it and would recommend it to ANYONE who would lend an ear. Its a creative and very mind demanding game. I love how it forces me to mentally compute without have to really think about an actual math problem and how it really forces the imagination go outside of the box to solve these. What i love most is that each level builds upon itself and doesn't leave me feeling like im playing the same thing over and over and over. Its a real challenge!
B00AREIAI8|5.0|My 12yr old and I both enjoy this game! The graphics are nice and there are a lot of fun levels!
B00B2V66VS|2.0|Well I played it for a day and I loved it was going to rate it 5 stars. But then it quit working on my kindle fire. You openit then it crashes wouldn't recommend it to people with other kindles. Thanks.
B00ADS98FC|5.0|Like a college version of glee.... Fat Amy is my fave! I'd definitely recommend this to anyone who likes glee and mash-ups
B00B2V66VS|5.0|don't worry. Temple run 2 is just as addicting... but you are no longer on the ground. Meet temple run floating styleeeee.
B004RZGUBM|5.0|How can you complain about getting every book, short story, play etc., by one of the greatest writers of all time for a couple of bucks.  I am currently reading Oliver Twist and enjoying it very much.
B005ZOBNOI|5.0|This is an incredibly well written story. It also speaks to the power of truth in all things. The humor, sensitivity, truth<br />and love between these two people is inspiring. It is difficult to know how to face ones death. This author manages<br />to do it.
B0015DYIH2|3.0|The movies are way better, during breaking dawn part two I was crying then screaming then crying again. It took a different path then the book. Bella was stronger, Edward actually got over himself, and Jacobs character pulled me in. The movies always kept you on the edge of your seat unlike the book. Also, Carlisle had a bigger part in the movie which is a plus!
B00AQ3K8IU|4.0|This was a sensitive portrayal of a young girl, and at the same time had its humorous moments.<br />It once again illustrates how profound childhood experiences can be.<br />It was a touching relationship with a compassionate boy, and a positive hopeful future.
B0020BUWX2|4.0|great book there love family loyal friends the ending left me wanting more but i would read book two in a heart beat
B002MQYOFW|5.0|I chose not to read this because I thought it was for teenagers and a younger audience. This book was so captivating an  I can't wait to read the other two in the trilogy.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|It's really fun and very entertaining for fun for everyone. It's also never blurry. And it's great for all kinds of horse lovers! Like me !!
B004LWZW42|5.0|I bought this for my husband it is one of his favorite movies and I checked around amazon had the best price and he was very happy with this gift.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|I thin  this game, my horse, is awesome. I had horses when I was little and we sold them and my mom said we could get more if I learned how to care for them . Now I know how to care for them. In fact, we are going to get my horse tomorrow. Thanks so much my horse app.
B009LH1Y1W|5.0|I bought 6 episodes of the 8th season online since I couldnt find them anywhere else, and I love Supernatural so.. I wasn't disappointed.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|I love this game it is like swag horses it is so awesome great is my treat tehe lovin it . I am so great to play
B008EZVNFE|5.0|I love this album! I've had it for a month and still listen to it everyday! I know you'll love it :)
B003K16P3M|5.0|This book was one the best books I've ever read, and I've read LOTS of books. Sure it's long, but it's soooo good!!!!
B004DLPXAO|5.0|5 stars does it for me . download it and got all the books i went for . good job
B0063IH60K|3.0|Fun game but gets a bit boring.  Wish there were more versions. But if you like to go over and over again it is for you.
B0071XO8RA|5.0|But as I continued to read it I couldn't put it down.  Now I've read the 6th and just downloaded the 7th.
B007VUA7VO|5.0|I like that is shows the percentage you have left. This is an awesome app to download. Would definitely recommend it.
B008XG1X18|5.0|Love  this app. It's so useful and fun! I find the cutest things for the MY little girl that I wouldn't have seen otherwise:)
B00B2V66VS|5.0|To legit to quit!! I like how they changed it were your viewing angle doesn't change with the slide, that was so annoying in the first one
B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|Each episode leaves me wanting more.  Well acted, well scripted and an amazing setting.  Best period drama ever.  Way to go BBC!
B0086HGW42|5.0|I love this album, I was not disappointed!<br /><br />Ed Sheeran is such an amazing artist, and his songs are all different. It's great
B002ZG97LK|4.0|This was a gift so I really don't know how the movie was.  It was received in good shape and arrived quickly.
B0011UJMK2|5.0|I loved this book.  I read it several years ago but when i saw it pop up at this price, I thought, \\"What a deal!\\"  Buy this book, you will love it.  This is a wild tale that will take you along and drag you breathless as you cross time and space and live in the moments created by the author.
B008JGSM6G|5.0|I love this app because it gives you a twist when you start to feel comfortable that you know what you are doing.
B002BI6SMI|5.0|In this film, there are plenty of action shots that keep you from being bored. The plot of letting your daughter go to France on her own with her friend and then being kidnapped is realistic. After the problem surfaced, the action takes place one scene after another. You will not get bored. There is always something happening. If you want to watch something that takes your mind away from work or school with lots of scenes that differ from daily life so that you can feel like you have escaped, then this film will do the job. The end result satisfied you at the end but not until the end of the film does the action stop. So I recommend this film to keep your mind from being preoccupied with your daily ritual. After the film is over, you can return to your daily routine.
0446582778|5.0|This was another fun ride with Harry Bosch, this time on the Angels Flight cable car in Ellay. As usual, I won't rehash the plot as every reviewer and their brother has already done that. All I can say is I found myself glued to my chair, unable to do almost anything else as I kept reading to find out what Harry would discover next.<br /><br />I had a feeling his marriage wouldn't last as he never seems to keep women around long. I guess that is the author's way of keeping Harry's sex life interesting. On the other hand, he also goes through partners and ex partners like breath mints. There's plenty of drama to be had and that aspect is milked for every ounce of mystery and intrigue.<br /><br />I came into the story with a blank slate and Mr. Connelly kept me guessing right until the end. I had inklings, but after having read so many other Bosch novels, I came to expect my inklings to be shattered. I wasn't disappointed.<br /><br />Some people didn't like the ending. I saw a twisted kind of justice in the ending. It actually worked for me.<br /><br />This was a great ride and now that I'm into the next one, it may very well be the last pure third-person Harry Bosch novel. I've already leafed through The Narrows and Lost Light and the first-person point of view turned me off so bad I have no desire to read a bunch of \\"I's\\" over and over again. Oh well...<br /><br />I still have two more though one is not really a Bosch novel (A Darkness More Than Night) and the new 2013 installment is a Mickey Haller novel so it's going to be half first-person so I'll have to pass on it. Too bad.<br /><br />As for this one, I almost hated to see it end. It had all the elements of a great detective thriller. Good solid writing in third-person, an engaging main character, plenty of drama and lots of twists and turns. Highly recommended.
0307956350|4.0|Written in the style of flashbacks, jump to present time, flash back to yet another time, jump ahead again but still a previous time, etc. so you have to pay attention so you know where you are in the story. Otherwise it was a good story. The ending left me wanting somewhat as not all the loose ends were tied up, but overall, I did enjoy reading it and would recommend it. It was fun.<br /><br />Note that it's not a thrill-a-minute spy action story with shootouts, explosions, car chases, or killings. It's cerebral with the protagonist figuring out what is happening and who's doing what in this white collar caper.
B00B2V66VS|3.0|you will play it a couple times and it wont come on.<br />it keeps on sending me back to the home screen. I am deleting this game.
B004GHNIRK|5.0|I've seen the play several times and loved it.  The books is wonderful and gives so much additional information and insight.  I will say that the author likes his tangents though.  This is  very uncommon in modern books, but not so much for older books.  I've heard the unabridged version has those cut out if you're not interested in them.
B005MYEPXC|5.0|I am not a raving Woody Allen fan.  But, this movie is the exception.  Both my husband and I loved this film.  It is the right blend of whimsy and insight.  It's one of those films you will watch again and again.
B009OYSFDM|5.0|Arrow is an outstanding and engaging show.  My wife and I missed the whole first season and only found it after watching the first show of the second season.  We downloaded the pilot and the second episode of the first season from Amazon.  We liked them so much we downloaded the entire rest of the first season and watched them all in two days.
B00782O7NE|5.0|This movie is worth it just for the dog.  And, the price for blu-ray was good.  It was a good find.
B008OOYALE|5.0|Dragon Story&trade; is an amazing game, but I think it is unfair the Kindle Fire version isn't  kept up to date with the IPhone's version. I would highly recommend updating it soon, or some low ratings might come up.
B00AQ3K8IU|5.0|Amazing!!  It's so easy to get attached and involved with the characters!!  Very sad but more so very moving and inspirational.  I love this book!!
B00AREIAI8|5.0|it is a very entertaining game. this game keeps me busy when I am very bored. it has very very very good graphics. love love love love love it!
B007EECSFA|4.0|This book shows the position of women, rich or poor, and how their lives were controlled and<br />limitations put on them even in war time. The tale starts off with what seems like an ordinary family living happily in the country until a surprising event changes everything and the secrecy begins that will last a lifetime.<br /><br />The unraveling of the secret brings a twist I never expected -- and that's what I liked about this story-- I hate stories that are predictable. In this case, I never saw it coming, and then it all made perfect sense.  Sometimes you get a second chance, but it's not guaranteed. You have to recognize an opening when it comes along; seize the opportunity & then be willing to fight for what matters most to you.
B008QTV3X0|5.0|Twists and turns at every corner.  Great acting and story lines.  Can't say enough good things about it.  Season 2 is just as good!
B00AFEXRME|4.0|This is a movie about addiction, acknowledgement and recovery.<br />The opening few minutes are pretty much hardcore sexual images. I guess the producer wanted to paint a picture of how far drugs/alcohol can take a person. I was a little surprised at Denzel as I don't recall him acting in such a capacity. Anyway, as the movie progresses, other than multiple expletives and seeing drugs & alcohol in a non serious manner, you get the point of the movie. The actors were pretty good and the storyline is simple but meaningful. However if you're concerned about placing debauched images/sounds in your mind, please watch a different movie.
B00B2V66VS|5.0|This is better than the first one! I especially like the little minecart your character can ride in. GET THIS APP
B005K0HDGE|5.0|I have always had a great interest in the assasination of JFK and all the conspiracy theories. This book takes these ideas to a new level with the main character going back in time to stop the killing. All the problems that develop with changing history evolve into a great story.
B000FA5SMK|5.0|As usual DeMille was at his best. I could actually believe that this goes on (or did) Plum Island is no longer used I  believe.
B0047Y0FGY|4.0|If you need some light reading & entertainment - worth getting. I definitely LOL'd at a few parts. Made me respect her as a comedian, professional, and woman.
B004DLPXAO|5.0|I really am excited that Amazon has expanded the Kindle's readability. It would be wonderful for Amazon if everybody owned a Hot, Firey Kindle, but the real money is in repetitive book purchases. Not one time sales.<br />Thanks for going far beyond the box. Keep doing - What you are doing - Your the Best !
B006MW3V6U|5.0|I am so glad I listened to my best friend and started watching ~ Season I and II all in one weekend!<br />Now I am all caught up and I plan on following this family through everything ......
B00AREIAI8|4.0|I love this game because you get to take care of your own horse you can earn gems and have fun.
B00B2V66VS|5.0|Dimensional views with new bonus structure.  Lots of fun.  Quite a bit more tough than the original. There are more obstacles and really fun railroad cart rides :)
B0064NTZKI|5.0|If you like Woody Allen, is a MUST see movie.<br />Is a great documentary where Allen really talks about himself and his personal life.
B00B19DMUE|5.0|How did this movie not get more traction in theaters and critical acclaim. In a world of teeny bopping unaging vampires and cheesy remakes of classic tales turned slightly scary, this movie finally scared the crud out of me and the wife! One of the best possession movies since exorcist in my opinion! Scary at home but would have been a great theater movie as well. I don't even remember it coming out. I am glad I didn't miss it completely.!
B00AREIAI8|5.0|Pretty cool and a lot of fun. If you like or love horses than you will love this game a lot........ BD
B004GHNIRK|3.0|Book was very long and only read part of it because I decided to see the movie.  Thoroughly enjoyed the story through the movie version.
B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|I purchased the entire series and watched all the epidsodes in a week. I was hooked and couldn't put down my Kindle.
B009CV3PN2|5.0|A must read for all true Americans to understand and appreciate the dedication, sacrifice and heroism of our elite Navy Seal Teams. Thank you Marcus for your service.
B009FZHYKU|5.0|Season 3(Part 1) Doesn't skip a beat. If you were worried the action would lull this season, don't!! Every episode is action packed and leaves you wanting more. Speaking of, I better watch again to refresh my memory. Can't wait for Part 2 to start
B00AREIAI8|4.0|graphics are pretty good, there are enough activities to keep you busy for awhile and plenty of choices for customization. overall, a pretty good game.
B003ES61EE|3.0|This pen isn't the best lens cleaning pen i own. The lid doesn't like to stay on and the brush doesn't like to stay put away. Its been pretty durable and is a good backup
1419705849|5.0|I bought three copies for my school library and it must be a good read because the books stay in constant circulation.  Price was excellent and beat my regular vendor.  With free shipping and no tax the purchase fit my needs.
B004WR125O|5.0|I purchased this so I didn't have to run an ethernet cable 30' from my office to my entertainment center. This makes the receiver much more than just an audio amplifier. I love that I can get my Spotify right on the receiver and use the Android remote app
B000P12LWY|5.0|The first season was truly the &#34;attention grabber.&#34;  After this, you just couldn't wait for the following 2 seasons to begin.
B004U52VPS|4.0|Game is pretty fun to play, they pieces are a little wobbly to put up sometimes. Overall pretty fun to launch the birds at the pigs just like on the mobile game
B001EO748M|5.0|After season 1, you couldn't wait for the next one to start.  All 3 seasons are wonderful and a must see.
B004SJ3BCI|5.0|I had heard of this game but never played it.  The first day I had the game I ran my kindle battery down in just a few hours playing non stop.  Good for all ages.  Now that I have completed all of the games I am going back through to get three stars on all of the games.
1451627297|5.0|This book is one that you can't put down!  It is definitely NOT your typical Stephen King novel. It was much better than most.
B004I744AS|5.0|Makes doing my vocab for class easy and fun, and has a lot of cool features! Best dictionary app I've tried.
B001N26GFC|2.0|Poppy thinks of herself as quirky, fun and kind, but you can't really be kind to people if you never put yourself in their shoes and are only interested in demonstrating your own happy personality.<br /><br /> She thinks she's being friendly to the bookstore employee but she never notices that he is trying to do some work on the computer and that she is constantly interrupting him. Poppy thinks she's the funny life of the party at her dance class but she's oblivious to the fact that she disrupts it by coming in late, making the teacher repeat everything and dressing so as to be the loud, off key note in the harmonious chorus.  As a teacher herself she should know better and at the very least she could have shown a bit of sympathy when the teacher has a slight break down.  Instead she ridicules her.<br /><br /> She takes her obliviously obnoxious behavior to it's most extreme by forcing her presence on a schizophrenic man who is obviously in the midst of a psychotic hallucination.  She adds to his paranoia and fear and risks her own safety, all to no purpose.  If Poppy was as kind and compassionate as this scene wants us to believe she would have quietly called the police so that the man could be taken to the hospital and given the medication and care he so desperately needed.<br /><br />She's judgmental and superior toward her sister for the great sin of living a conventional lifestyle.<br /><br />She's intolerably rude and disrespectful to her driving instructor, cruelly pushing him to the edge of his already fragile sanity, and she's cavalier with the lives of others as she drives recklessly down the street while talking incessantly about herself.<br /><br />Poppy is thrilled with her own happy self but I'm glad I don't have to deal with her. I'll keep my grumpy but considerate friends any day.
B009VSW15Y|2.0|Keeps freezing hard to get it to working . I've tried everything and still it won't work it's making me upset
B007SYWFRM|5.0|My kids love this app and can't seem to get enough of it. Its fun and keeps them entertained and that is great
B009UX2YAC|5.0|it's fun to do when you just want to relax and not hard to follow. we all like to play
B004MC8CA2|5.0|Want something that has several versions, you can add notes to, and is easy to use? This is the one!!,
B004J4WKUQ|5.0|Amazing- I just cant bring myself to to realize the stories over!I want to read it all over again  right now!!  I hope earnest clone writes some more awesome books!!!can't wait for more!
B001ANSSDC|5.0|Hysterically Funny.  Definitely recommend.  The voice of the main character, while strange due to mental illness, is endearing.  Very different from the movie, better actually.
B000OYC7A8|3.0|I have mixed feelings about this dvd/blu-ray.<br /><br />First off, I saw this tour when it hit the Toronto famous Massey Hall, that show was stunning and magnificent. A nearly spiritual happening. The interplay between David and Rick was something to behold, it is probably a feeling I will never experience again at a concert.<br /><br />Sadly this release failed to recapture the magic of that show. I'll cover the pros and cons of this release.<br /><br />Pros:<br />1 The musicianship is superb<br />2 OAI sounds way better live than it did on the overproduced studio version<br />3 Rick Wright<br />4 Deep cuts from the back catalog<br />5 ECHOES!!!!!!<br />6 The dvd sounds great<br /><br />Cons:<br />1 Crosby and Nash detract and are a distraction from the flow of the show. Much better  without them<br />2 David Bowie is horrible filling in for Roger Waters<br />3 Video reproduction that fails to capture what the live show looked like<br />4 Overproduced quick camera cuts and fading angles from the back of Royal Albert Hall are a distraction (although this is an unfortunate and common issue with many concert releases nowadays)<br />5 CSN song \\"The Cost of Freedom\\" replaces the epic \\"Wots uh the Deal?\\" which was one of my favorite performances from the tour (Selling out to get CSN fans to buy this release?)<br />6 Bowie singing for Waters on C Numb is not only horrible (point 2), but it takes away from one or Rick Wrights shining moments. Rick sang Rogers parts every night of this tour, except for the one that got released on DVD. WAS THE MONEY GRAB TO SELL THIS TO A FEW BOWIE FANS REALLY WORTH SELLING OUT YOUR FRIEND MR GILMOUR?<br />7 In the first leg of the tour \\"speak to me, breathe, and time were the first songs of the second set and OAI was the first set. Not a huge deal but I liked it better that way.<br /><br />In conclusion this could have been a great release had they shown this tour in the way that 99% of the tour was. And that means NO Crosby, Nash, or Bowie. They could have included those tracks as extras.<br /><br />Instead we get extras of Rick Wright singing C Numb and an extra of Wots uh the Deal?. This stinks to high hell of a money grab to swing fans of CSN and Bowie to buy this who might not have otherwise purchased. Unfortunately you are selling out the artist integrity of the project in so doing.<br /><br />In the end this is worth buying. If nothing else Echoes alone is worth the price of admission! OAI also sounds way better live then studio.<br /><br />UPDATE:<br />The Blu Ray is head and shoulders above the DVD. The audio of the Blu Ray is 10x better than the audio of the DVD. The picture is also a huge upgrade.<br /><br />That being said the above criticisms listed still apply. After viewing Pulse again it is hard to imagine that the same director put both of these films together.<br /><br />Die hard Floyd fans should have this, but, oh what could have been...
B00B2V66VS|4.0|downloaded game played for a while stooped then went beck to play game would not open removed and lost all coins<br /> then reinstalled crash again what's the problem.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|Great and thrilling read! Probably one of the best books I have read and I can't wait to start the next.
B00629SZMS|5.0|I bought these for my daughter, age 4, to decorate her princess room.  They are a nice size and make a wonderful edition to her magical room.  They come with lots of small stickers also, my daughter loves them.
B009DA74ES|5.0|Will keep flollowing. Great program. Had a good time watching. Very interesting. Drama is will written. Hate that I'm being forrced to writen so many words.
B007IXWL2C|1.0|Poorly written.  Sex is great! But come on really!!!! Timeline was unbelievable .  I would have quit after book one, but someone encouraged me to read on.  Book 2 was a little better, so I bought book 3.  Overall, it was a waste of good reading time.
B009LDCZDC|5.0|Great program. Had a good time watching. Very interesting. Drama is will written. Hate that I'm being forrced to writen so many words.

B000XUBFE2|4.0|Very good book but wish there would have been more at the end to wrap it up.  But other then that great writing and story.
B003JTHXOK|5.0|He keeps you entranced with the story line. I couldn't put it down. I really like how his stories are like real life but also storylike at the same time.
B001J29H9I|5.0|Got all the great traits of your fave BK sounds. If you haven't picked up one of these shorties, start with this one and you'll download the others like I did.
B00AIQP9DE|3.0|enjoyable but too short for my taste.  graphics are outstanding and has a good storyline.  works well on kindle fire.  was aware from the beginning that to continue game I would need to purchase.
B00A8ECU24|1.0|I have played it on my iPhone. I crashed and I lost everything. all my gems and stars. the game just froze. no refund on purchases. start it on my kindle fire only to have it crash whenever I try to visit friend's towns to drop chest. the game loft people have no answer or clues on how to fix the issue. I am so frustrated and disappointed. don't invest any money. you will crash and gameloft will burn you.
B005LAIGQ4|5.0|Anyone that wants a great family movie needs to see this one. It has a little bit of everything, it will make you sad, happy, laugh, mad, sit on the edge of your seat and you will be amazed and you will cheer!
B000JQUHLM|5.0|Even though I'm now considered a \\"Senior\\", I guess I'll always just a kid at heart!  I always wondered what happened to the character of Pollyanna after watching the Disney movie when I was a child. I used to make up all sorts of adventures for her, never knowing that someone already had written a book about it.  I couldn't resist reading the book when I saw it listed on Amazon.  I couldn't remember any of the senarios I had created, but I certainly had fun reading this one.<br />I don't think you're ever \\"too old\\" to read a children's book. I think they remind us of what we used to love, and they can be so charming!
B008IZYW3U|2.0|The string composition drowns out the vocal performances of Cassat and Freddie Mercury. Sounds like just noise. The original was just piano accompaniment.
B007MNV5WU|2.0|I couldn't get it into my Kindle, but I'm still trying.  I was able to use it once, but it wouldn't really work.
B008JGSM6G|5.0|I enjoy playing this game.  It is very addictive.  I challenge others while we play. There is not only one way to solve the game
B007FEFLTO|5.0|Lately I have been drawn to books about the time period between the first and second WWs.  I feel that reading fiction works that really do follow known historical facts make that era come alive because they include personal experiences.  This book excels in the personal because it includes characters from Britain, Germany, Russia, and America. Since I was born in the 40s it has helped me understand the world I grew up in, in ways that I never have before.  Much better than a history class.
B000AY74OG|5.0|I picked this movie up for our daughter since she enjoys Shrek and Shrek II. I thought this movie was very cute and gave the viewer a different side to zoo animals. It starts out as the characters are in the zoo minding their own business when the penguins have an idea to leave the zoo for Antarctica. Marty (the zebra) decides the zoo life is not for him as well. Long story short, they end up getting boarded up and sent to Madagascar and have to survive on the island.<br /><br />It has funny moments, songs, and a good story line.
B005ZOBNOI|5.0|This was a sweet, funny, and heartbreaking story. I didn't want it to end because I knew there would be sadness somewhere in the storyline, but I am so happy I read it.
B001CQONKY|5.0|This is a very good season from the CSI series. This season features the second part of Living Doll/Dead Doll (miniature killer collection) that left of from the 7th season. There is a crossover episode from this season that continues over on Without A Trace (Who and What/When and Where).<br /><br />Some features from this season is:<br />Episode called 'Goodbye and Good Luck'- The CSI's investigate when a college freshman plunges to her death and her death is revealed to be a murder. They discover the victim had a relationship with Marlon West, a teen who was acquitted on a murder charge with the help of his younger sister, a child prodigy named Hannah. Sara handles the case and she becomes convinced Hannah killed Marlon's girlfriend and is framing him for the murder as an attempt to put him in jail and keep control of him.<br /><br />Warrick Brown fights some inner demons<br />Sara Sidle leaves the force (I was never a big fan of the character)<br /><br />All in all, very structured season as always from CBS and a must have for a fan of the series.
0345525558|5.0|My book club chose this book and I am glad they did! The story was interesting and I cared about what happened to the characters. Simply put, it is a story of the healing of deep childhood wounds.
B00AQKEPMI|5.0|This is an Awesome, Heartwarming  Movie!! One I will buy for our Movie Library to watch again and again!<br />Reviews from my Grandchildren-<br />\\"Nana-That was THE BEST MOVIE We've EVER Seen!!!\\"
B0012GMU8Q|5.0|I love this album and it is even better on vinyl. I'm very glad to have bought it. Definitely a must buy.
B00005JKC3|4.0|This movie had much to say.  It was a bit heady for many.  There are times I go to the movies to zone out and be entertained (superhero and action movies) and there are times I go to think (docu-dramas etc).  This is an action movie with a good deal of inner angst under the surface.  As for a critique:<br /><br />1. Hulk - this version of the Hulk is far superior to the 2008 version.  In terms of size, strength, capabilities, agility, and looking like a Hulk rather than looking like Dorian Yates on Hydroxcut, this version of the Hulk is just plain better.  Of course the smaller but equally strong Avengers version is IMHO best of all.  As with the Avengers Hulk, I didn't understand why the Hulk, when surrounded (by cops and national guard or by aliens) didn't just jump.<br /><br />2. Jennifer Connelly was amazing as Betty.  Her every look conveyed so much simultaneously and that scene on the stairs in San Fran - wow - those eyes just melt me.  She reminds me of a past love.  Enough said.  But why couldn't she just sit the hell down with daddy and hash out the issues?  Doesn't seem that complicated.<br /><br />3. Sam Elliot sucked as a military officer.  To me it seemed he earned the title \\"RAGE MONSTER\\" far more than did the Hulk.  Was Sam Elliot ever not having a tantrum in the entire movie?  We're supposed to believe that a guy with that level of anger management issues would ever make it to the General Officer ranks?  Please!  He might have made 0-6 having tantrums like that if he was stationed at a remote base...but O-10?  In peacetime?  Losing control when there is no reason to do so?  LMFAO.  \\"Sometimes you eat the bear and sometimes the bear eats you.\\"<br /><br />Ditto for the blonde contractor guy - we get that he wanted to make money - but what was the point of going over to the house to beat Bruce up?  Risk a courts martial / arrest and loss of his security clearance and pissing off the General - why?  Is kicking the ass of some guy you're jealous of reallyworth it?  What good could have possibly come from beating up Bruce at that point?  What was the upside?  Nothing.  It made no sense.<br /><br />4. Nick Nolte's drug issues may have helped him portray the estranged David Banner in this movie.  In a way he stole the show.  Didn't understand why he'd sacrifice his dogs just to manipulate his son though.  Didn't seem consistent with the actions of a lonely old hermit to send his beloved dogs off to die like that.  Also didn't understand why, after he'd converted to pure energy, he didn't just take off - rather than conspicuously fighting Hulk - knowing that the military had to be sending a nuclear strike as soon as they located him.  Why not just take off?  You're pure energy...the Hulk is a bulletproof ape who jumps like a flea.<br /><br />5. Bana - the name was right, the look was right, and the pants were right.  All the same, he just seemed a bit unconvincing to me as a brilliant scientist.  Most brilliant scientists I've met are quirky and nerdy but they are also usually self-aware with some sense of irony and humor.  Bana seems like a guy in need of major therapy from the very beginning - we get the childhood trauma but where was the coping mechanism?  No humor at all (meaning he doesn't even see the funny side of things - many people don't crack jokes or say anything but can quietly see the humor in things - he doesn't - that seems very un-traumatized genius to me.<br /><br />Suffice to say I work with nerds.  Bana in this role is almost like a small child in many ways - clueless.  By contrast the Avengers Banner is world weary, cynical, and totally disenchanted, but still sees the humor and is a very keen observer of the human condition.  He doesn't miss a thing - he just doesn't see the need to broadcast it.  That to me is more consistent with who the character is, what he is going through, and what he should convey.<br /><br />People who know they are the smartest person in the room, or the strongest, or themost capable, yet despite all their gifts feel that they cannot have what they really want (a normal life with the woman he loves in the case of Banner) tend to be much more like the Avenger's Banner.  They see through and tolerate everyone who is a basically decent person, speak only when they have something of importance to contribute, and see humor in most things without necessarily saying anything.  They are also usually cynical as hell - often quietly so.  Because they know who they are and what they have, they have a more quiet confidence to them.<br /><br />Overall, the story line (lots of Daddy issues) was very busy, the hulk was awesome, but the characters seemed very poorly considered.
B00AMBM9MO|2.0|Crude humor wears thin half way through and then very boring after the novelty wears off. My daughter insisted on renting this and then I find she went to bed and I was the last one standing suffering through this.

B00AIQP9DE|5.0|I really LOVE this app! I played the free version completely and plan to purchase the full version! I highly recommend it! Most apps of this type are very hard to see which makes them difficult to play. This one is wonderful with phenomenal graphics and storyline. I wish I could rate it higher than 5! Love it! Can't wait to get the full version!

B00B2V66VS|5.0|I love the original Temple Run. I got this app because the second one is always better. I love how in the beginning you slide on a rope and also sometimes you can go in a mine shack. I guarantee you will love this app as much as I do.<br />  -Madeline Ashton

B00005JKES|3.0|The first episode on the first disc of Season One box sets should not start out with, \\"Previously on [insert name of show[...\\"  The Twin Peaks pilot episode is, even as a stand-alone, one of the best pieces of TV programming ever aired, and it is crucial for understanding the series, as it sets up the entire show (well, most of the good parts of the show, anyway, before it started meandering somewhat aimlessly).  So where is it?  TP is a great show, but this package was a real let-down due to the lack of the pilot.
034580404X|5.0|book set just as described- brand new just as said<br />great ship time<br />don't know what else to say great item
B000YGIIQI|5.0|Well written book by Gordons words ,he tells his story as if he were talking to you.Much better than his other biography.
B008JGSM6G|5.0|On so many levels, this game offers each individual increasing challenges and yet &#34;play time.&#34; I have so much stress in my life that I turn to this game for relief.  I can play it when I'm babysitting, too.  The 8x8 board games where you have to cover all the squares in addition to finishing each pipeline challenges you to think differently.  This is my favorite game!
B003ODIZL6|5.0|I love this dictionary,because you can  improve your vocabulary. You can use it for speeches, schoolwork,or just about anything. The limits of your language are the limits of your world.- Ludwig Wittgenstien. I also like that it has slang terms,so that you can understand what young people are saying now-a-days.

0345803507|1.0|Amazon demands that use at least 20 words to describe this book.<br />Alright, here we go:<br />This book is an absolute garbage with no plot, no descriptive writing, no style, no depth, no character development, no climax, and no editor.<br />This is not enough? OK, here we go again:<br />This is the most degrading, unhealthy, abusive, ugly, disrespectful fiction I have ever read, and I have read a lot. I have read good erotica with strong male protagonists, but those books, having lots of sex, sometimes hard core sex, even BDSM and submission, were never so disrespectful and loathsome. And the writing was on a high level. There was style, there was creativity, there was plot!<br />The downfall of literature began when this became a bestseller.
1936891026|5.0|I read a lot. Mostly non-fiction. I hate self-help books. This was highly recommended by Joe Rogan as a way to focus and see Art as work...what an understatement, this should be required for every college grad, or person who doesn't know what to do next. It is kick in the ass and puts everything in perspective.
0345803493|1.0|If this were a fanfiction written by some 16-year-old, I'd say ok, the girl is growing up and has some dark unhealthy fantasies, but if they remain fantasies only, then no problem for her.<br />But it's a *beep* bestseller!<br />I'm still thinking this book might be a product of some research, and sooner or later we shall find out about it.<br />Can I at least hope that millions of people living on Earth cannot be so hopeless, tasteless, and clueless?<br />This world needs an update asap.
B003JTHXOK|5.0|I really enjoyed this book.  Couldn't put it down and always wanted to read ahead; typical Nicholas Sparks book. I would definitely recommend to a friend.
B009U9S6FI|5.0|A terrific book which helps put so many things in life in perspective. Unfortunately, evil exists in this world. Sometimes it's self imposed and sometimes we are just victims. Frankl leads one to understand  that hope - hope in the future, hope for loved ones, or hope that one day  you will be free of harm - can help you survive the most heinous of tragedies. A great book.
B009YP9L7U|4.0|I couldn't put this book down.  A little unrealistic but still a good book.  I would recommend to a friend
B007BFSYMS|5.0|It does what it says.<br />I don't have a problem sleeping, I like having ambient sounds like crickets, thunder or waterfalls.<br />There are a lot you can download after you load the program.

B00AKKGX4W|5.0|This was a wonderful book. I could not put it down. Absolutely witty. I was laughing through out the book. The love story was enchanting and perfect. If you love witty word play, with a great love story this is for you. A standing ovation for Coutney Milan!

B008M87GJK|4.0|excellent source for news. World news stories reporting better then cnn and nbc. Good web site layout for easy flow.
B00AEJM6H2|5.0|Not much to say.  If you enjoy jewel matching games, this is fun, pretty, a little challenging, but mainly for mindless entertainment. I like that there are 3 choices  of style to play.  I play on a Samsung Galaxy SIII and have had no problems.
B005K0HDGE|5.0|I wish I could just read it and not have to put it down.  Too bad I have to do other things in life.

B0020BUWX2|5.0|I enjoyed this book because it shows the strength of the mind and spirit and the willpower to carry on
B006VREN86|1.0|A fraud.  No realism whatsoever.  Artificial in all regards with the unrealistic to-the-era precise dialouge and set design and perfectly handsome 'pretty people' cast - no blemishes or ugly, fat or not so cool looking people whatsoever. Everyone is beautiful. Clothing and movie sets and dinner ware and wine glasses and bed linens and hotel room bathrooms and restaurant bars and street scenes and men's vests and women's earrings and hair dos and haircuts and hired staff and shiny cars are beautiful.  Dialogue is precise, lines are perfectly scripted. Facial expressions are laser like less we 'mis-interpret' the (17 year old) director's message. No uhs or ahs or normal human downers. No blowing of one's nose. No subtle scratching of one's ass.  All is 'perfect' through the child director's obsession with form and his warped immature idea of how real people relate.  Nothing in the realm of true natural interaction and expression is allowed.  Did not even reach the 'gotta have for ratings' sex scenes I've read about. No loss. In summary, this HBO series (is this HBO?) is simply, to the times and people that did exist, insulting garbage.
B001EN71CW|5.0|Firefly is simply the best series I've seen made for TV. Too bad it didn't last long, but great that it is still available.
B00B2V66VS|5.0|This game is so addicting and I love how it makes time fly by so quickly. The new game features are fun especially the underground &quot;train&quot;. I notice the touch interference is a little different but it's all good.
B0067LY4WG|4.0|It blows the mind but it's already been a year that Cohen released his most recent studio album?<br /><br />\\"Old Ideas\\" (10 tracks; 41 min.) starts off with Cohen addressing himself on \\"Going Home\\" (\\"I love to speak with Leonard/He's a sportsman and a shepherd/He's a lazy bastard/Living in a suit\\", ha!). \\"Amen\\" is a 8 min. epic tune, with Cohen's voice now reduced to a very deep baritone, almost speaking/growling more than singing. The arrangements on these songs are very sparse, reminiscent of Cohen's \\"Dear Heather\\" 2004 album, and it works very nicely. \\"Darkness\\" is the most hard hitting, almost biting, song on here (\\"I got not future/I know my days are few/The present's not that pleasant/Just a lot of things to do/I thought the past would last me/But the darkness got that too\\", wow). \\"Crazy to Love You\\" is credited to both Cohen and Anjani Thomas (Cohen's real-life partner, she sings back-up voicals on the album as well).<br /><br />In all, a year later, this album remains as fresh as ever. Ever since Cohen returned to the music business in 2008, he has been enjoying unparalleled success, and very much deserved of course. I had the great fortune of seeing Leonard Cohen in concert at the 2009 Coachella music festival, just as the sun was setting, it was THE highlight of the festival for me and one of the more memorable sets I've ever seen live. Bottom line: who needs new ideas, when you've got \\"Old Ideas\\" like these? HIGHLY RECOMMENDED!
B0070Y46UY|5.0|Very well written. Fast read, I did not want to put it down. The story makes you think about what you would do.

B008O9V4C2|4.0|Jazziz' newest issue (winter 2013) features \\"Planet d'Rhonda\\" in their CD set, but in truth they could have chosen any of the tracks here. What you've got here is classic Fagen. Almost minimalist bass, done a bit staccato in contrast to Marcus Miller's work, without any of Miller's subwoofer-dependent thump. Don't get me wrong--I love Marcus Miller. To me the word \\"marcusmiller\\" is another word for \\"bass\\". But Fagen puts people on those four strings who prove that \\"understated\\" doesn't necessarily mean \\"barely audible\\". Guitar? Same sort of thing. You don't need \\"shredding\\" on every guitar part in today's music, and the two players used here are proof of that. Horn work that's balanced rather than dominant. None of the drum & bugle corps blare a la Blood Sweat & Tears, early Chicago or Earth Wind & Fire. A bit light on the vocal harmonies, though. They're still in there, but not in the Manhattan Transfer mode we're used to. Mostly at the tag end of Fagen's lead lines. And Fagen's lead vocals belie his sixty-plus years. Robert Goulet once said that the advantage of being a baritone is that your voice gets better with age. In Fagen's case, his somewhat plaintive mezzo is at least as good as it ever was. Somebody here said that this album is too short. Actually at 44 minutes it's longer than the landmark \\"Nightfly\\". The disadvantage of CD albums is that maybe people have gotten too used to 60-minutes-plus. Which is ironic, because back when CDs first came out, punk and alt artists were moaning that they preferred vinyl because with CDs the record companies expected 60-minutes-plus, forcing them to put in tracks that were \\"filler\\". But then again, negativism is to be expected from artists whose music itself is hate speech. One thing that stands out here--no Walter Becker. Somebody else here said that Fagen has always been the primary force driving Steely Dan and this album proves it--it sounds like it falls somewhere in the Original Seven. I have a theory that the difference between a Fagen album and a Steely Dan one is whether or not Becker was available for all tracks. The only bummer is that I could have downloaded this album for a bit more than half the CD price I paid, but Amazon has made some changes in the downloading format that makes it not very user-friendly. After several attempts, I had to just say \\"fuggedaboudit\\" and order it in CD. So I ended up getting it three days later than I'd planned (shrug). Well, it's here now and it served as a mood-improving soundtrack for my morning walk today.rence between a Fagen album and a Steely Dan one is whether or not Becker was available for all tracks.

B00AYB0TOW|5.0|It grows exponentially more difficult to create a good action movie, especially one that can stand out from the massive corpus of material.  Stories get trite or convoluted, visuals get bloated or too heavy on the CGI.  But Dredd works.  Definitely the best action movie I've seen in several years.<br /><br />Here's why.  The movie is tightly controlled:  Dredd says very little but what he says is concise, like the language of a Hemingway novel; the film is short without overblown drama or lengthy kill sequences; the music propels the film without getting in the way of the flow; scenery and individual scenes are interconnected and aligned so that the story moves quickly but not abruptly; and the editing pays homage to keen observers who need little reference for story connection.<br /><br />Simple yet effective film making requires enormous discipline, and it is precisely what makes this movie excellent.

B002OKO1GI|5.0|Love it. My husband never watched this and my 5 month old loves dog movies. So it was a perfect buy. And my husband love it too!
B005LAJ17M|5.0|We heard this show was really good so we bought the DVDs and really enjoyed being able to watch one right after the other and not have to wait for next week!  We are now considering subscribing to Showtime so we can watch Season 2 as we now love the show- but, for less money, we can wait and buy the DVDs at the end of the season and watch them all in a row, plus loan them to others- so we're leaning more toward that.  This seller sent the set very quickly and they arrived in perfect condition in a brand new, sealed package.  I hope we can buy the next season from this seller too!

B00A9X9TIW|5.0|I went in to this movie thinking it was going to be a typical time traveler movie with a rather linear plot. This one did indeed throw me for a loop. The three separate time lines were difficult to follow at first. The finale cleared them up while leaving room to come to your own conclusions. This movie is right in line with &#34;Army of the Twelve Monkeys&#34; and &#34;Jacobs Ladder&#34;.

B003TOMAPC|5.0|This is deinitelky not your typical super hero movie. This was a violent tale of one geek who had had enough with the crime and violence in his city. Mistakenly thinks he was alone he gets in way over his head and is recued by the real super heros. The violence was over the top and just right for this movie. The martial arts/gymnastics of &#34;Hit-Girl&#34; were truly amazing considering Chloë Grace Moretz performed most of them herself.<br /><br />Slow beginning. Picks up in the middle. Greate over the top super hero ending.
B00A3ATW4M|1.0|If you're thinking of buying this... just don't. As other reviewers mentioned, Glee should be a show with anti-bullying, peace and love messages and whatnot. But then, its \\"creators\\" (I guess that's not a good name, since they don't really \\"create\\" much) lash out at anyone who doesn't let them play their songs (Slash, Kings of Leon, Foo Fighters...).<br />Calling the rightful song owners \\"stupid\\" and \\"self-centered a******s\\", real classy.<br /><br />And, as if that wasn't enough, they literally bully the \\"small guys\\" like Jonathan Coulton. In case you haven't heard it yet, just google for Jonathan Coulton Baby Got Back and you'll find some comparisons to the version that Glee played.<br /><br />It's a blatant rip-off, and Fox didn't even care to give the guy any credit. And that's why you shouldn't give them your hard-earned money. Especially because you can buy the tracks from their real creators, and you will get the same exact songs.
1451695195|5.0|got this for my Dad and he loved it.. He read it twice back to back.. and even highlighted parts.
B007L4HET8|5.0|Have all 3 movies in DVD format - this was a great price to be able to upgrade to Bluray!  Well worth it, the difference is amazing!!!!
B00AIQP9DE|3.0|It was fun, but didn't seem worth what it cost. Enjoyed it while it lasted though. I like problem solving games.
B00B2V66VS|4.0|over all its pretty good. But the thing I don't like about this game is that the controls are a little harder. But if your up to challenge you should download this game.
B000QFQE4U|5.0|Very good film, well made movie has a lot of interesting parts a must see movie taking you back to the roaring twenties.
B009UX2YAC|3.0|well the game is sort of a copy of Temple Run and I see no difference but only the graphics are better in Temple Run
1455155624|1.0|I was very disappointed in this book. More like a text book. You need a phd in physics to get through. We listened only to part of the first cd before giving up.
B007NESBK2|5.0|Sade what more to say....Audio was phenomonal if you have the right stuff..Why do I have to write so many words for this review?
B00AQ3K8IU|5.0|Could not put this book down!  The characters jumped off the page right into my heart.  I wish for every girl to have a Holden in their life.
B006HTUZ1C|5.0|Great for the kids.  IT was free as well so that made it even better. :) If you have young children I would recommend this for them.
B005K0HDGE|4.0|the bookis good it takes a while to get going the middle drags but the end is great. I recomend it to king fans
B007PT3QOQ|3.0|This game is ok.  I did like it but I thought it would be like the older version of the Oregan train and it wasn't.  Still it was free and so I did not lose anything by it.  I still do play it from time to time just not as much as I would have if it was more like the older one.
8866131121|5.0|I LOVE Moleskine products!  The paper takes ink well and provides a smooth writing surface that makes my job as a writer so much easier and less stressful and tiring.  Any way that I can reduce writer's fatigue is welcome.<br />  For people who like to use a daily format for scheduling this is the book to get.
B00A3DZ61W|5.0|If you like angry birds or if you've never played it before...doesn't matter...this is one that will catch your attention. Lots of fun
0763630497|5.0|The words of Michael J. Rosen and watercolor illustrations by Stan Fellows combine into a lovely 64-page (32 sheets) book that is a delight to the eyes.  At age 59 I love picture books and this is definitely a picture book that adults and children will appreciate.  I purchased a copy for my private library.
B008MEM24S|5.0|This is a game that requires some thought to solve the &#34;puzzles&#34; and save Perry. Very fun and addicting. My 7 year old son and I both enjoy this one.
B00AREIAI8|4.0|Overall good game. Fun and potentially informative for a younger audience. The only thing to look out for is the start-up for the app taking a while or not working at all.
B0086700CM|1.0|This app goes to the main screen with an i on it and then cuts off and goes back to my main screen and tries to load again. This is all my son talks about and it's disappointing. I also bought the temple run &#34;Brave&#34; but it does the same thing. All other games I have gotten for free and paid for work. It's just the temple run. Any help would be welcomed!
B009O2XY12|4.0|This game is lot of fun, and somewhat challenging. I would reccomend this game to anyone who wants to have a little fun.
B00AIQP9DE|4.0|This game was very interesting and absorbing. Once you begin playing you don't want to stop. It can be addictive and it was worth the small fee.
B0076DELIG|5.0|Excellent. I had trouble putting this book down to get on with the daily chores!! I would certainly recommend it.
B007SYWFRM|5.0|This game is very fun and is a lot like cityville a facebook game, except with animals that have lost their homes.
B003XF1XOQ|5.0|Finally got everybody back where they should be and I can close up and go to sleep! Amost interesting concept.
B0094BB4TW|3.0|This app is FUNCTIONAL but is bulky and hard to navigate. I often find myself just reverting back to my cell phone version anyway. Facebook has had time to refine this app, so what gives?
B005K0HDGE|3.0|Decent suspense yarn with some fantastical scenes -- I only wish Big Steve hadn't felt the need to prove so exhaustively that he'd done his homework.  (Though I can buy the subject as the Moby Dick of the boomer generation.)  His style just gets smoother with age (if a bit more detail-obsessive) and it's the reason I will always read at least once any novel he publishes+.
076115678X|3.0|...I mean, the theories contained in this book SOUND good. But in practice, my hair became greasy and the curls were weighed down by all of the oil (thereby no longer being nearly as cute and springy as they normally are). I'm guessing this is a great book for someone with a head full of frizz that they have no idea how to care for or style, but for me, a person who already knows what works for her hair, not so much.
B00992CF6W|3.0|I am a die hard mincraft fan, I even have styrofoam cut outs (and painted)  of the tools so I can play with my kid sister. So as soon as this app was out for kindle I almost had a heart attack. I was so excited but after playing it since 3.0 version and only seeing a few updates in almost a year it really makes me sad. I feel that mojang is short changing us. For example, a one man team can create a (ripped off yes but still) version of minecraft and he provides updates almost WEEKLY!! (im talking about survivalcraft). What im saying is it just dissapoints me that mojang isn't giving us that many great or even GOOD updates, we still don't have armor, skins, texture packs, or even emerald. I understand that your busy and mobile devices lack but....STEP IT UP MOJANG!
B0070Y46UY|5.0|Fast paced. Very suspenseful. Very easy read. Story of courage, insight, and man's ability to reason. Recommend this for all ages.
B00AKL1XPU|5.0|this game is good for someone who doesn't want to wait for an energy bar to fill up and to also have a love for animals like me!! :)
B00ATDOVNK|5.0|This is a really great game that keeps u entertained. Reading the other reviews I knew there was a cost involved and feel this is worth the $2.99
B008VBYN80|5.0|I found this game and its pretty easy to get the hang of. and you can level up quick too.
B008OJ291W|2.0|Let's get one thing straight right off the bat. This is an ELO album, not an Electric Light Orchestra album. Fans of the band know the difference. As Jeff Lynne transitioned away from using real string instruments, beginning with 1979's \\"Discovery,\\" the \\"Orchestra\\" players were jettisoned in favor of synthesized keyboards, his control over the band was solidified, and the group's long-form name banished  in favor of the shorter ELO. From that point on, ELO still put out some really good music, but it's best days and most distinctive music were behind it.<br /><br />By re-recording all the band's hits by himself, Lynne, whose contributions to Electric Light Orchestra always comprised the lion's share of its artistic and musical output, has admirably managed to recreate much of the sound of the originals ... but not enough to make this album successful. He has parroted the originals almost note-for-note. But without the spark of his fellow musicians in Electric Light Orchestra pushing him forward the sound rings hollow. I'm reminded of an 8-track collection I once received for Christmas as a teenager called \\"American Pop\\" which featured \\"hits by the original artists.\\" I loved the songs ... \\"Tossin' and Turnin',\\" \\"Under the Boardwalk,\\" \\"Tell Laura I Love Her.\\" What I didn't know since I was only marginally acquainted with the songs prior to that was that they were re-recordings. Over time as I heard the original 1950s and 1960s versions I understood the versions on my 8-tracks were inferior; the sounds were close, but thinner, somewhat more overwrought and underproduced,and definitely more synthesized. Still, the 8-tracks did introduce me to the songs, which indirectly led me back to the originals, so I give them credit for that. Unfortunately, the same qualities can be found in Mr Blue Sky: The Very Best of Electric Light Orchestra: thinner sound, slightly strained vocals, and the loss of the lush, rich orchestral sounds that made the originals so distinctive. The choice of synthesizing previously orchestral parts is unfortunate.<br /><br />I'm also curious as to the purpose of this project. An accompanying DVD hagiography, replete with glowing interviews with Paul McCartney, fellow Wilbury Tom Petty and others seems like a shot across the bow at the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame, which to date has unjustly overlooked Lynne. All his Wilbury kin long ago joined the Hall and he belongs there, too.<br /><br />If you don't already own ELO's music, I recommend sticking with any of the many compilations; my personal favorite is the three-disc Afterglow. Also, Epic/Legacy has started reissuing the originals with bonus tracks at very inexpensive prices (I got Eldorado at Fry's Electronics for $5.99).
0670026603|5.0|I have not read a book that made me laugh out loud in a long time.  This book was funny, sweet, and quite moving. It makes you think about the quality of life and having control over your own destiny.  I was drawn in immediately and could hardly put it down.  I was so sad when I finished.  I highly recommend this book!!
B00A9C3RB8|5.0|I love movies that Meryl Streep are in, so this was a no brainer for me.  I just love her acting.
B007R9MFPU|4.0|Ultravox were always one of the better acts from the New Wave-British synth pop heyday. I think that Brilliant is a fine example of their work. It has a good mix of ballads and up-tempo songs. Their synthesizer/guitar sound was always distinctive and remains so. Personal favorites on the album include, \\"Live\\" \\"Brilliant\\" \\"Rise\\" \\"Hello\\" and \\"Satellite\\".
B009AMANBA|4.0|Daniel Day-Lewis's near miraculous recreation of Lincoln in Spielberg's dramatization of the last few months of Lincoln's presidency may very well bring him his third Oscar in a leading role. He has strong competition from Denzel Washington, for Flight, who is my pick for this year's best actor, but Day-Lewis's brilliant depiction of America's greatest President, during his finest hour in office, is the most \\"Oscar friendly\\" performance this year. This is a perfect role for a richly deserving actor to break that \\"Two-Oscar-Barrier\\" for a starring role that has eluded the greatest actors in history from Gary Cooper, Marlon Brando and Spencer Tracy to Dustin Hoffman and Jack Nicholson.<br /><br />To see Daniel Day-Lewis's inspired performance as America's great statesman is to witness the re-birth of a deeper, more involved form of acting, that can only be called a small cinematic miracle. To Spielberg's credit, and to his costume and production design staff, we once again see a supremely capable actor vanishing completely into his part. The transformation is as authentic and enthralling as any in film history. There were moments in this film, when the recreation of the president and his time were so well done that the film seemed like a collection of lost footage of the actual President. The magic of this reconstruction of Lincoln and his time is so complete that at moments I felt as though I had gone back in time to eavesdrop into Lincoln's life, to see how the great man really looked, walked, and talked.<br /><br />The script, grave and full of high matters as it is, focuses on Lincoln's adeptness at playing the political game with his grit and honesty to pass a crucial bill that changes the country forever. The dramatic power of Lincoln's patient resolve, his unstinting instinct for justice and political gamesmanship, this meeting of high ideals and shrewdness in the face of the peculiar breed of political realities he faces shows how one individual can transcend conflict and partisanship for much larger ideals. This exceedingly difficult moment in American history, during the waning years of the civil war, is the right occasion for Lincoln's high ideals, his \\"true north\\", to take possession of the national consciousness. This movie is a reminder of how even the grim reality of a darkened world must ultimately make way for the larger ideals of a man of courage and high resolve.<br /><br />The excellence of the character portrayal of the great man, the brilliant evocation of the period of the civil war, however, seemed to stand in stark contrast to the relative ordinariness of the overall film. While Lincoln is dramatically compelling, \\"Lincoln\\" does get bogged down in the dramatization of the intricacies and elaborate negotiations behind Lincoln's quest to find twenty additional votes needed to amend the constitution to outlaw slavery before the end of the war. There are many moments during the film when I thought the dialogue gets tired and blunts the dramatic tension of the behind-the-scene political maneuverings.<br /><br />The film has all the ingredients for the makings of an unforgettable film but where it is strong on character and spectacle it is relatively weak at crucial moments in the larger telling of the story. The film just does not succeed in distilling the emotional resonance of this compelling moment of history. The all round brilliance of the main cast and its supporting acting talent from David Strathaim to Tommy Lee Jones fails to lift the film from the relatively flat setting up of the political story that unfolds.<br /><br />The film succeeds in flashes when it shows how Lincoln's family drama compounds rather than alleviates his political problems during crucial moments in his Presidency. These inspired moments come with a detailed rendering of Lincoln's spiritual resilience when it is tested to its limits. The crises being handed down to him by the day, by the hour, only ends up igniting Lincoln's legendary tact and patience. The great magic of this piece of cinema is how it sustains our interest in its brilliant reconstruction of both the public figure and the great man in his private life despite the pitfalls of the laborious story.<br /><br />In sum, \\"Lincoln\\" has periods of dramatic dullness largely rescued by Daniel Day-Lewis's inspired recreation of Lincoln, the man and statesman. The patience, wisdom, and political largeness of Lincoln's example shine through in a commanding rendition of Lincoln by an astonishing Day-Lewis performance. The gravity of Day-Lewis's gestures, his slow dignified movements, the near high pitched deliberative, drawl of his speech, goes beyond being just Lincolnesque; it as if a resurrected Lincoln moves before our eyes on screen. The actor, the recreated President, looms imposingly and rescues the film to a large degree.endary tact and patience.

B0010SKUYM|5.0|I am lucky. I just found another top author. I am excited that there are more books available. This book is immediately captavating and original.
1451695195|5.0|For anyone that dose not believe in God or a hereafter may be more than just tempted to change their view once this book is read.  I think it belongs in every  library, and should be put into the many prisons around the world, right next to the bible.

B001UV4XIS|5.0|All of the Harry Potter movies are great.  It had a great ending and didn't expect that.  But wish this wasn't the last of Harry<br />Potter.
B006TF6WAM|5.0|I don't know why I bought this book.  It popped up when I was getting '100 Year Old Man' and somehow it took my fancy.  And I am very glad it did.  Warm and touchingly human as a non-achiever sets out to accomplish a mission step by step and finds his life changing as he does so.  The author has a good grasp of human nature and is a good writer.
B004SJ3BCI|3.0|Like the game but sometimes get frustrated that I cannot get all the structure and birds with the number of birds I have to<br />try and knock it down with.

B000SMWUPS|5.0|This is a must for the parent on the go.  It fits great between the handlebars of a bob stroller and provides the extra storage and cup holders to make this a truly handy helper for the parent who is trying to take all that is needed to keep a baby or toddler comfortable.
B00B2V66VS|2.0|The game has nice graphics and runs smoothly.  However, it is to hard to play without spending money on in game purchases.
B000RLHDUM|5.0|Excellent, a christmas gift for husband and he loved it and had been wanting it for some time now.  He never tires of watching it.

B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|I found Downton Abbey in December (2012) and spent most of two weeks watching season 1 and 2 to catch up.  I can't believe I am now caught up and now have to wait a week for each new episode.  I love this story!
B000I0RR76|1.0|I had to send it back. UPS charged me $10.69 to do so. Find me a copy that works and send it to me.
B008FYZIVY|5.0|Wonderful watching. Love the slice-of-life glimpses like the ironing of newspapers to prevent the ink from blackening his Lordship's hands; the adressing of cooks and house matrons as &#34;Mrs.&#34;, even if the women are unmarried.  I could go on and on. The viewer can't help but feel transported to another time and place!
B00B2V66VS|3.0|it was genuinly an amazing game on my kindle fire, until, it started not to load.i deleted it but the amazon app store still says that it is open.whats going on here, imangi?
B0091LS07E|5.0|In my opinion, this is one of Alicia Keys best to date. The message in many of the songs are powerful and inspiring, especially the song entitled &#34;Brand New Me&#34;.  The song featuring Maxwell is also good listening.
B00AMBK0X4|4.0|Funnier than imagined! Laugh out loud and take your mind off of life funny! Good rental and buy in the future!!
B0000CDLC8|4.0|Everything sounded great, except no DD5.1 on second disc.  I like to listen in  my car with my surround sound
B00AAQ7LP6|1.0|Love Rihanna, her previous video is an example of the best performance ever,her eyes are what melts the video audience, this one I can shut my eyes and enjoy it, but performances and her looks are raunchy. I prefer less to see, so we can want her more. Here \\"more\\" is ruining what could of been a great video. I guess performers are persuded by alot of fake friends, promotors, video directors that just nod yes to keep their jobs or obtain the good side of a performer who is just looking for approval.<br />I wish Rihanna would look at her earlier video, and I also miss her past back up singers, these back up singers did not sound good.
B000AU9UYC|5.0|Came really quickly, didnt have any trouble playing the dvd. good movie and would not have picked a different one.
B008LD4126|5.0|Dead in the Boot - Elbow, This is a fine addition to the library of music produced by Elbow. The lyrics seem to be more personal on this one.
B001N8V7KA|5.0|Eastwood was perfect for this movie.It starts off a bit slow the first half of the movie,but once he lights up firefox...it's time for some fun Eastwood style!It is a very good movie with a great storyline and action packed!

B00AP9RQE4|5.0|This story about Miles's cousin Ivan gives a different slant to the series.  It is told from Ivan's point of view and is rather engaging.  I enjoyed the different viewpoint and the dealings of Ivan with his new in-laws.
B0012HQKZE|5.0|This is an excellent movie about survival and with a great cast and storyline!I loved this movie because of the extremely beautiful wilderness scenery and the great performances by the cast...especially Hopkins!This is an awesome movie that everyone should see!
B00APACSJG|4.0|This book is a good read.  It is not one of the Best of the Miles series but it is good.  I liked Miles interaction with the kids in the story and it does fit in well with the series.
B00AQ3K8IU|5.0|One of the best books I've ever read. I simply couldn't put it down. The twists in the journey were surprising and left me raw and aching in a way that the story lept from the book and touched my life. You will not be disappointed and it'll be s story that you won't soon forget.
B00B2V66VS|1.0|I love temple run. But temple run 2 is another story. It doesn't download on my kindle fire. I need it to be fixed
B009VB7QQA|1.0|And now I know for sure why.  Just terrible really.  Maybe a few decent scenes but overall do not waste your money. If you got to see this for whatever reason, then wait until it is FREE.
B007VUA7VO|5.0|It is a good lite version of battery hd I didn't buy the full one you should so I say u should get it.

B00AE2LJVS|4.0|Nice movie to watch, LaBeof does a really good job and the brother in the movie rock too, I recommend taking the time to watch this for sure.

B001G0MFOM|5.0|This season was sooo good. To bad it had to end. My personal favorite character was Shane. I would recemmoned this season to everyone
B00AREIAI8|5.0|Very enjoyable app. All my children like to play. Wish the jewels were not so expensive. Or that I could lock the jewels from my younger children.
B003JTHXOK|5.0|I really enjoyed this book. I would recommend this book to friends and family.  It kept me in suspense thoughout the book.
B0034DGPEU|5.0|I'm always looking for an outstanding audio narration performance and Orlagh Cassidy and Bahni Turpin met my highest expectations. The tension in this story only allowed me a short bursts of reading/listening at a time-- I do like to spread a good story out. I listened to it on audible.com and then read it on Kindle, toggling back and forth- the syncing was perfect!
B009ZZDNT6|4.0|This app is great. I really like it. It wakes me up without annoying me. I keep snoozing it until I 'm ready to get up without waking up my husband.
B009VLX8FS|5.0|If you are a Taylor Swift fan you need this album. It has been on repeat in my car now for at least 3 weeks. I highly recommend this album to anyone.
B00AK0X5VQ|5.0|Relaxing and rewarding. Maybe a bit addicting too. Looks extremely 'organic' on my Kindle HD. My favorite game at this time.
B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|I got hooked on Season 1 and have continued to be entertained.  Wish I lived there in that period and upstairs!
B000N2HBSO|5.0|I am 82 years old and have been an avid reader from the time I learned how to read. This is one of the best books I have ever read. It is extremely well written. It is a great history of the people and the events of this period. One thing stood out. That Lincoln was truly a far greater man than I had thought he was. He was the right man for this time and I wonder how our nation would have been had he not been president. Don't miss this book!
B0034DGPEU|4.0|After the first couple of chapters I really was hooked.  The characters came alive and the story was engaging.  The dialogs were realistic and the story moved along.  Set in the 1700's you will follow the life of an orphan Irish girl raised by the black servants of a Southern mansion in the separate kitchen house.  A bit like Upstairs and Downstairs the story follows the lives of Black and White over a period of about 25 years.  For me the ending lacked closure and felt like a set up for a second book.  Overall I enjoyed this book.
B00B2V66VS|5.0|This game is epic. I haven't played another. game after I got this. My cousin bragged that. he got it on the first day it came out.So I got it
B0071XO8RA|5.0|I have been captivated since book one I absolutely love this series the detail and depth of the story telling make this series stand out  in a crowd.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|This is a great app it is a must have for everybody who loves horses best game ever love my horsey hay.
B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|Tried and true Downton Abbey addict here!  I bought Amazon Prime so that I could watch it on my television/roku instead of having to watch on my computer after each weekly episode!!  By Season 3 you know I'm watching cause its awesome.  What else is there?  I have subscribed to the Season Pass thingy for this show and don't regret it a bit.  I save a few cents per ep with Season Pass and I would be getting them all anyway.  Over all, very happy with my investment and happy that I will be able to watch the episodes any time I like with my Amazon account.  And Amazon isn't going under any time soon..... right?
B00846REIS|5.0|In this series I find myself able to do little other than read. Open another bottle of wine, then read more. Excellent development of all characters, not just the lovers. I am in these for the long haul, cannot believe I have to wait until May for the next release....

B003TSEEDY|5.0|This book was amazing. I couldn't put it down. It's a very powerful and meaning book. The Perks Of Being A Wallflower is a book that anyone should read.
B00AEJM6H2|5.0|can be very challenging. many different twist of design. fun but take up a lot of times to play. wa
B009K0P10K|5.0|This show is awesome. It always leaves you wanting more. These people are so devious, i can't keep up! You think, how could this go on much longer? But there is always another twist
B00AKL1XPU|5.0|its a fun game where you can build your own zoo and rescue animals. you can also visit other zoo's and earn hearts by helping them out.
B001ANSSDC|4.0|The Silver Linings Playbook is a heartfelt, sad, moving and funny story of one man's battle with mental illness.<br /><br />WARNING- CONTAINS SOME MINOR SPOILERS:<br /><br />Pat Peoples struggles with bipolar disorder and has been institutionalized for several years until his mother gets him released and into her care.  He has violent episodes and a weird aversion to Kenny G that borders on fear.  He has no real concept of how much time has passed and he still struggles with his separation from his estranged wife, Nikki.  He is in denial that his marriage is over and is still holding out hope that she will take him back.  He thinks he will win her approval if he reads all of her favorite books and he is obsessed with exercise so he can be \\"fit\\" for her.  Even though several years have passed since their separation, he still believes they will reconcile after \\"apart\\" time has ended.  Pat's family is struggling with how to deal with his mental illness and even though his relationship with his father is strained, they seem to come together for game day for their beloved Philadelphia Eagles.<br /><br />Pat soon meets Tiffany, a widow and the sister-in-law of his best friend, who struggles with her own issues caused by the loss of her husband.  Tiffany is quirky to say the least and I just loved this character. After her initial meeting with Pat, she starts following him during his daily jogs around his Collingswood, New Jersey neighborhood.  They soon form an uneasy sort of friendship that involves sharing Raisin Bran for dinner and a Dance Away Depression competition.  Tiffany really cares for Pat and wants to help him find closure so he can move on with his life.  Eventually they find comfort, hope and that silver lining in their mutual need for each other.<br /><br />I really enjoyed the story and loved that it was set in South Jersey.  I am looking forward to seeing the Oscar nominated movie.  I would recommend this to everyone, especially Eagles fans.  There is a lot of Eagles football talk in this book.ot of Eagles football talk in this book.
1441979212|4.0|This book is really good for students from other countries. I have worked with ESL students all my life and think this text is perfect for their needs. It is detailed and goes to the basics on writing an academic paper you want to publish.
B002PEP4SC|4.0|If you are a Castle devotee the book and characters give you a couple of extra nights of interest in all of them and the similarities to the tv show
B007F7XXKA|5.0|Gives you an idea of the global situation. It may be discouraging to learn that no single country can prop up the economy of a continent.
B003L20IJM|5.0|I really enjoyed this movie as much as the first movie. Nanny McPhee is back at what she does best. Emmma Thompson's performance was amazing again! If you loved the first film, this one will not disappoint you!
B00B2V66VS|1.0|Disappointing  Nice game.  Crashes constantly on kindle fire.  Works fine on my iPhone  Android version has bugs that are frustrating
B000F1IQNM|5.0|I have to say this is not only a great family movie, but makes an adult feel like a kid again! Emma Thompson's performance as Nanny Mcphee was amazing! If you love some good fun, plenty of laughs and a great film, this is for you!
B007XKEY6Q|5.0|I am not the best at these kind of games . But OMGPOP makes it so easy to play and win.
B000SKNIWE|5.0|Picture and sound fantastic.  Great for all ages to enjoy watching together.  Lots of viewing time, great photography, wonderful addition to anyone's DVD library.
B00AREIAI8|4.0|good game if you are a horse lover pictures are great no problems with it yet my children think the horses are beautiful
B009YP9L7U|5.0|Great book. I loved it. Just when you thought how can Megan get out of this situation , you want her to stay in it forever.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|this is super amazing!! I'm a horse lover and its amazing :) you will enjoy it for sure. if you're a horse lover like me then this game is recommended for you.
B0015DROBO|4.0|Well written, logical, fast paced and detailed. Larsson has created characters and woven a story that's addictive. Couldn't wait to read the next book.
B0054JZC6E|5.0|this game is so much fun i like the challenges they have i love to play this game all day is one of my fav games i enjoy it alot the only thing is that i hate having to replay the games to get more points but oyher thag that the games are really really cool
B0000A02TZ|5.0|I got exactly what was sold. The movie comes in a nice case just like it would if you bought it in the store. No damage or defects, put it in the player and it worked just fine. No complaints from me.
B007J4T2G8|5.0|Addicting! I couldn't put it down so read it in one day! I was expecting it to be so much more raunchy from everything I've overheard but it wasn't. Just purchased book 2 so off to read I go :-)
B0007939NO|5.0|This is now of my all time favorite movies, Very glad to add ithis to my collection. Arrived just as described.
B009VB97EY|2.0|Not a good movie , slow moving and as much talent that was in the movie they should of been able to carry it off.
B00A25NLOU|5.0|This book was the perfect combination of mystery and books, in the tradition of Ecco's &#34;The Name of the Rose.&#34; A page-turner!
B0070Y46UY|4.0|Enjoyable reading...a little slow for me in the beginning but still a great book.  Spritual, uplifting and inspirational.  I would recommend this book to a friend.
B0067TGSOK|5.0|I am an experienced business women, so starting a new business does not worry me.  I picked this book to help my husband start his first business.  I read it first to see if I thought it worth while.  To my surprise I learned quite a bit.  And now we are having a martial start up contest to see which of our $100. start ups will be the first to net us income.<br /><br />We saw Chris speak on his book tour in Santa Cruz, nice to see he was just like the rest of us, and was dedicated to his vision.  Thanks for a well written helpful book.<br /><br />Only negative is the kindle view, the graphs were unusable in this version.  Amazon are you listening??<br /><br />By the way we are in our mid 50's and I would say we were the average age of the people who attended his talk.  New options for those displaced by the recession.  Attention boomers.<br /><br />My husband and I are starting \\"retirement businesses\\"
B005K2YTG4|5.0|I really like this case. Its very attractive and functional. One of my favorite things about this case is that the 3 color stripes are different fabrics and textures; Its really nice to hold in your hand and feel. The inside is a red soft type of fabric that makes you feel at ease while you slide the kindle in and out without worry of scratching the screen. This case just makes me love my Kindle Paperwhite even more!
B000FBFN1U|5.0|A great continuation of the series. The longest so far but also went by the quickest for me! Definitely give it a shot if you have read the first two.
B005ZMUZDU|5.0|This was my son's favorite movie when he was little, and now my daughter's. It's nice to see a cartoon without all the adult humor! One that really is for kids!
B004478GNI|3.0|It was cool look and went over well with my cousins but it only took them 30 mins to assemble.  You are paying a premium for the Star Wars theme.
B008ASGP3U|5.0|Ian Rankin is a. talented storyteller.Once again a Rankin  Rebus story delivers the goods. The flawed and troubled Rebus delightful character.Sometimes the ends justify the l.p.means. The surrounding other characters are equally fascinating.This<br />is a true page turner and a joyful read for any Rankin fan.
B009FZHYKU|5.0|I was a fan of Season 1 just because it was a episode-based tv show of zombies.<br />I was a fan of Season 2 because it started to show how people break down in these situations.<br />I am a fan of Season 3 because now that I love the characters... there is non-stop action and suspense.<br /><br />Season 1 is ok for beginning a show.<br />Season 2 is slower and more of a soap opera.  Still good.<br />Season 3 is ridiculously action packed and full of new characters.
B00AQ3K8IU|5.0|This book has the same concept of other books in the same genre, but the delivery and storyline definitely pack a major punch. I cried through most of the ending and thoroughly enjoyed this read and could not put my kindle down. The plot twist was one I was not expecting and that's what was mainly enjoyable (although gut-wrenching). I laughed out loud and I cried in public and could have cared less because I was so engrossed in the story! Thank you so much Colleen Hoover!
B002G1YPH0|5.0|A relatively quiet fan attaches a heatsink which fans out neatly in a cubic shape.  Though the package contain only 1 fan, not 2, the fan is easily cling onto or release from the heatsink.  The heatsink is quite sturdy and does not bent off during rough handling when I install it.  The cross screws come with several different installation position to tightly seat the heatsink on cpu.  It comes with arctic thermal gel which make the installation much easier.
B009GE9Y44|4.0|It has an interesting story with a lot of action. Would of liked to see s bit morr comedy and romance in the movie like leon and ada.
B0083P1QUM|4.0|I love Kay Scarpetta!  Always love a new one!  Keep it up Patricia!  Loved the story, kept my interest to finish it.
B0095VP8D4|5.0|Just built a new system with this APU as the base.  It has exceeded my expectations.  The onboard graphics are for real, and are very good.  I found it easy to mate the integrated graphics with a video card, but for all but high end gaming, the APU graphics is all you need.  About the only draw back was Amazon's shipping......strange to say the least.  Took nearly two weeks to get it, and it went through several different carries.
B00B2V66VS|5.0|it has better features and great graphics!!! amazing new temple run!!! great job Imangi Studios!!! get the new temple run!
B009MCRHH6|5.0|This is the best game app I have played.  Once you start it is hard to put down.  Gets very challenging as you move through the seasons.  I very highly recommend for hours of fun.  Hoping to see newer World Of Goo apps in the future.  This is a must have!
B004K4IZ3G|5.0|If you loved the original Tron movie, you'll love this movie.  If you never saw the original Tron movie, this is still a great movie.  Great visuals, great music!  Best to own on Blu-Ray with a good entertainment system (with lots of Bass).  Turn it up LOUD and enjoy!
B0094BB4TW|5.0|Good way to keep up on friends coming and goings and just fun to be nosy. love the pictures of everyone also.
B009SJ3H8Q|5.0|This season is completely different from last season.  Alot of the original actors from last season, but they are different characters this time around.  Awesome story lines.  If you like horror / disturbing behavior, this is for you!
B008X9Z37A|1.0|I ordered this cover for my new kindle fire.  However, even though I thought I got the right one, there is a difference in size between a kindle fire and a kindle fire HD.  I returned it and bought the correct cover in a store.  That should be specified for the new buyers.
B002BU0DPE|5.0|Decent headset, but has a bunch of wires. Other than that the sound and mic quality is majestic. Get. Them. Now. Don't even hesitate. Right now. Click that add to cart button and take it to the check out.
B004SJ3BCI|5.0|I heard all the craze over this game I downloaded it to my table the Nexus 7 and now I am addicted to it and any age can play this from my 2 yr old grandchild to us adults who love to be kids :)
B00B2V66VS|5.0|If you enjoyed the first game you will really enjoy this one. Also it's free, so why are you reading this?  Download it and play!
B0094BB4TW|5.0|Have this product on my Nexus 7 and it looks and feel the same as on desktop.  Only issue is that you can not edit your profile thru the tablet you have to use a computer for that. Other wise it loads faster on my tablet then my laptop
B004ZN9W5M|4.0|The quality of the sound in this version is outstanding. Really glad I got this for my husband for Christmas.
B00B2V66VS|3.0|stuck somewhere.  says it is there on cloud and device but won't open or uninstall.  big bug to fix.  he loved this, now disappointed cant play it.  I will see if removing it from Cloud will fix it.
B009YP9L7U|1.0|I didn't care much for this story. I thought it lacked depth. I shouldn't have been surprised since it was free.
0547848412|5.0|Book arrived on time and in excellent condition.  Beginning of story itself is long and drawn out. Hopefully it'll get better as I read further. Great seller and will buy from again.
B001P9EQH8|5.0|I'm using as I type this, at first nothing seemed to happen but after a bit I realized that the vocals on my test playlist seemed crisper, the mids were a Tad more noticeable, and the bass was more hooky while giving the overall sound a warmer feel. Great amp and it has aluminum construction and feels solid. Also it come with an I'd number to check its authenticity on fiio's website. Took about 10 seconds to find mine was authentic. Came nicely packaged and on time. Overall great experience for my over ear headphones however it didn't do much. Its not enough power. Look into the E7 or E11 for on ear/over ear. Great little device though.
B001NZB5GO|1.0|Audio quality is very poor- words are barely intelligible. Was aired on TBS a few days after I received DVD and the TV audio was excellent. Other DVD titles have great audio. Don't know what happened with this one. I think seller didn't know he had received poor DVD. Arrived on time. Will buy from again.
B0077PBPJ6|1.0|The story was very hard to follow. Language was hard to understand. The movie should have been X-rated for nudity and sex! I was so glad that I watched it by myself before letting 13 year old watch it. I thought that all Masterpiece movies were okay for family viewing but this was shocking. I threw the DVD in the trash!!
B001ANSSDC|5.0|What a heartfelt written book. From the first page you are drawn into Pat`s world. I couldn't wait to turn the page. How honest he is to his beliefs and how all he wants to do is be a good man just takes your breath away! When the story cones near the end and you read what happens your heart just breaks. His constant reference to the movie of hi  life is such a unique idea and truly makes you believe that there always is a silver lining!
B00B2V66VS|5.0|Here is my reaction after playing a minute. ONE more game.  &quot;eye twitches&quot;  hours later. &quot;(Name withheld)! Time for bed&quot; yells my mom... then I say &quot;huh?&quot; To stall until I finish my like, hundredth game from &quot;one more game&quot;<br /><br />ALSO! If you see a book called &quot;the hot dog&quot; that is a book about my dog as a superhero, it's mine, I made it. BUT I haven't got it to a publisher yet...
B003G4W49C|5.0|This is a groundbreaking concept in the possible future of the universe and how it functions with living beings.<br />It covers a mutiplicity of possibilities in how a world would deal with a perceived enemy threat.<br />The dynamics of removing children from a family due to potential abilities and intelligence to convert them into military and government leaders is phenomenol. What a fascinating read that tweaks your brain to a higher level of contemplation.
B002JVWR9U|5.0|i have read the books shortly after i watched  season 1 the tv series i think the tv series is way better than the books.
B008Y6QZ56|5.0|This was a fantastic movie that was about more than the fighting within the cage. Excellent acting all the way around.
B003L77GH4|5.0|i have read the books shortly after i watched  season 1 the tv series i think the tv series is way better than the books .
B007IXWKUK|3.0|They are back and forth and in the end, Christian is unwilling to actually want more even though he says he wants more.
B0097PW7H8|5.0|This app will show you everything you need to know to keep your battery performing at peak.  It will manage the charging cycles and battery usage if you set it up correctly.  A good solid app.
0761158820|5.0|My kids can't get enough of these paper monsters. We've gone through two books now and we'll probably buy another.
B000WBZ5M0|5.0|I got this for my friend and he loves them! He has seen all of them but wanted them for watching all the time so I got him these he was very grateful!
B006G7R25W|5.0|A truly wonderful film from both a technological standpoint and from an intelligence standpoint. Rock Hudson and the cast were wonderful. Non-stop action. A bit confusing at the end, but then the Cold War had a tendency to be confusing.
B00773YOB4|5.0|Bonnie consistently rocks.  I love her jazzy style and heart-stomping country stories.  Toe-tapping, &#34;can I get a witness&#34; lyrics make me smile.
B001QVFDA4|5.0|It is action, drama, offbeat, crazy, great soundtrack, violent, but beautifully done and extremely fun to watch! Twenty thumbs up!
B009GX7IRA|5.0|Love the sensitivity of Abby and each of the other characters. Tony has definitely matured in his character and each week leaves me wondering how they are going to top the current show.
0307719774|5.0|I love writing in this journal every night. I try not to look ahead so I am surprised by each day's question (at least for the first year). I can't until I can look back and see how my answers have changed over the years. And each question requires just a short answer (or forces a short answer) because there are only four lines to write on for each year, and those lines are pretty small. The book is pretty small, so it doesn't take up much room if I need to travel with it. So happy I purchased this journal!
B00AREIAI8|5.0|great game! fabulous graphics and great horses. I earn gems just fine without a buy. I do have problems loading the game everytime.
B0015DROBO|5.0|It took a bit to get through the beginning....but that back story is so necessary. And worth every minute. A must read...
B007ZGO7EM|5.0|Is handy yo have it when you need a calculator. I love it is very practical. I will recommend it to a friend.
B009TZ7WDK|5.0|Unbelievable voices. I rarely buy whole albums, and certainly not after listening to their youtube videos, but this one... My god, that's the first thing that I did. They both have beautiful voices, and I think they work extremely well together. I'm not a trained musician, so perhaps I'm not as nuanced as some other people.<br /><br />I noticed some people talking about how he should \\"dump\\" Charlotte, and I'm like... really? That's all some people view her as? A crutch? That's just silly, it's a DUO album. If he does make a SOLO album, great! I'll probably be one of the first to buy them. If she makes a SOLO album, I'd probably there too. Saying that she's holding him back seems ass-backwards. They sound great together, they sound great separate, winning both ways. Just enjoy the music for whatever it is and look forward to more things for the future!<br /><br />But anyways, great album, would highly recommend it!
B00AREIAI8|5.0|I like this app a lot....I enjoy the time consuming play! And it was free!!<br />There s a weird slowness about the health, and some other specific s
B001USHRCK|5.0|My 8 yr old son and I (his 37 yr old mom) put this together, and I enjoyed it just as much as he did!
B00B2V66VS|1.0|this is the worst app ever made. every time I try to open it it wont let me. I hate it and I hope they don't make anymore. all I have to say is if you buy it then good luck.
B00ATDOVNK|5.0|This game makes you jump like your actually in the game . I love this app. Enjoyed every minute of the app
B003XF1XOQ|5.0|As much as I want to hate these books due to everything going on in the world I found myself not being able to set them down until I was finished! I can't wait to see the last 2 movies and see the awesomeness of these books come to life!!! I absolutely loved reading them would recommend them to any adult reader!!!
B009ZQC7MY|5.0|I absolutely love this show. The acting is wonderful, the story is always exciting, and the costumes and set are visually stunning.
B007J4T2G8|4.0|Looking forward to book 2. Maybe my expectations were low, but I really enjoyed it. Glad I took the recommendation.
0375703764|5.0|Amazing book, completly sucks you in and keeps you flipping pages. I love the complexity in the story telling and all the different stuff going on at once.
B00APUYWYA|5.0|It was pretty funny and entertaining. I love fat Amy! Rebel Wilson is hilarious! It seemed a little longer than it needed to be but I still really liked it!
B00AYB0TOW|1.0|This whole movie just reminded me of Die Hard. Locked in one building against a lot of bad guys. The first movie was much better . This one just didnt click with me ,plenty of blood and guts shoot them in the face. Maybe worth watching one time just to see what they did different ,but not worth buying.
B0015DYIH2|5.0|Where's the next book ? (; I wish there was more after this one :(( I love this is book so much!!
B008HK3XKO|3.0|This is good protection from dropping and such. When it come to being a stand on the side it's barely self standing. You have to be very careful not to knock it down or else it will fall flat! The design is flawed. I usually try to give good reviews to products I buy but, to be honest this doesn't cut it because it's just to flimsy as a stand. Otherwise it's a great cover!
B00AREIAI8|5.0|this game is the best game ever I have always wanted a horse but I live in the city and not allowed to have one
B008DKBQMK|1.0|Was mailed the wrong item. Returned and had my aunt make me a case that works way better. Might have liked if I had gotten the right item.
B00AMBH70S|1.0|The movie itself was fine, but I had so much trouble with the streaming stopping, Amazons system not working for chunks of time, taking a long time to load, etc that I wasn't even able to finish the movie. I have had numerous problems with Amazon's streaming quality and don't think I will rent an instant video from them again because of it. It is just not worth the hassle.
B002R22PB6|5.0|great movie and great content. did not like the sub titles, but wonderful actors. &#34;The Sea Inside&#34; should be watched by everyone.
B007ZXK08C|4.0|I really enjoyed this book - it kept me in suspense until the end - which came too soon! Would recommend it. I must say that many of the review give too much away of the story and might spoil it.
B0086700CM|3.0|Sometimes it won't tilt  I love so please fix it. I've had it for so long and I really LOVE it
B0052VUNHC|5.0|Absolutely loved this book. I may have rated this book already but I have read this book numerous times! This is a must read!
B0095ZMMCK|4.0|Pretty much standard fair.  Well written,fast paced with a very scary look at a possible scenario.<br />Enjoyed it, I just wasn't blown away like I have been in the past.
B006VFLIYK|5.0|I couldn't put it down He drew the reader from one chapter to the next The book title<br />The Innocent well done
B008MG1E4A|5.0|What a fantastic inside look at the operation. Truth. No politically motivated false info. I also loved the personal stories and the build up of characters. From the day i downloaded this to my Kindle I have not been able to put it down. Thank you!!!!
B007XKEY6Q|5.0|I love playing this game.  I'm no artist but it is still fun.  I really like playing with friends and family too.  I haven't had any problems either.  Oh...one thing is I don't understand how to earn the badges.
B007IXWL2C|1.0|I don't understand the draw.  Biggest turnoff is the dominant, controlling, abusive man.  I had high hopes for this book, but I truly hated it!
B004XISI4A|5.0|This book is great! I would recommend it to anyone. I thoroughly enjoyed it, and it was so hard to put down.
B00003CXBK|5.0|Possibly my favorite work by Miyazaki... The forest scenes are incredible. Probably a bit scary for under 10 years old, but thought provoking for young and old...
B007QUUJMG|5.0|This book has been on my 'to read' list for a while, and it was worth the wait. It's one of those books which you make time to read. The main character is charming, and relate-able. Extremely well written and the plot was great.
1451688091|5.0|Wonderfully written account of Lincoln and the decisions he had to make.  History is usually boring for me but this book was gripping.  Carried my interest from San Francisco to Seoul to Taipei
B00B2V66VS|5.0|this is the most awesomest game on planet earth. AWESOME!!!!!!!!!!! I love it. this game is the best. if this game was lever made I don't know what I would do.
B008HK3QII|2.0|Cheap and not very convinent to use bought for my sons kindle and ended up buying another case instead. Spend the extra money on something better.
B001UV4XIS|5.0|If you don't love the Harry Potter series, you are doomed to a miserable existence, involving loneliness and despair for all of your days.
1608871452|5.0|I am three pages in and love this book!  The behind the scenes information on how the show was created exceeds my wildest dreams!  I cannot wait to read the rest of the book!  Plus, all the little extra items, postcards, sticklers, pictures, etc., make this a must have item for even the most passing of fans.
B006LSZECO|3.0|This was not the\\"can't put it down\\" book I was lead to believe.  I love to read those novels on the best sellers list, but this was a little disappointing.
B007BFSYMS|4.0|And quality ones at that! You can go online and download more. I would have give it five stars, but the instructions were a little vague.
B006LSZECO|5.0|loved this book, couldn't put it down........wasn't what I expected, really different story and ending....great author! I would read more of his work - definitely
0765325950|5.0|I tried to read it slowly. I will miss the Wheel of Time after decades of reading.<br />Thank you Mr. Jordan for everything.
B007SGLZP8|5.0|Grisham never disappoints, the Racketeer is excellent reading! Couldn't put it down,  great storyline, believable characters, just loved it - looking forward to the next one
B00AREIAI8|5.0|this app.is awesome!! great for the kindle fire edition. neat way to prepare before getting the real deal!! awesome keep making it happen Amazon.
B005HSG3TC|5.0|This was a gift and it arrived in plenty of time. It is a great product. My daughter was the recipient and she loves it.
B008133MDK|5.0|This show is well written, the people who star in it have great chemistry and are also hilarious. Highly recommended for people who like smart shows with witty characters.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|I think it is a great app if you love horses and care for them too answer me do you love and care for horses
B005MMJ84K|5.0|Yes, I am an adult that love YA dystopian novels. Lauren Oliver is one of the most exceptional writers in this genre. I loved Delirium and Pandemonium just added to the greatness. I can't wait for the third one to come out in a few months! If you loved the Hunger Games or any of those types of books, you'll love anything by Lauren Oliver.
B00ATDOVNK|4.0|My 7, 9 &amp; 10 year olds love it. They were so upset when they finished the free version and had to either use their meager allowance to pay for the full version or stop playing.  G5 - When the tears came, I banned all G5 games because I don't want to deal with their heartbreak after each free game.
B006RUJST6|5.0|I am an early 30 something year old woman who loves tween novels, whatever! However, this one was super cute and I became invested in the characters and their stories. Nice read with a lot of emotion.
0451219597|2.0|I love Ken follet books but this one was missing something. I read half of it maybe I'll pick it up again someday.
B006LSZECO|5.0|This book is insane. I love Gillian Flynn's other books and this one was no exception. Intense characters, crazy situations, so many unknowns and questions all along the way. Ms. Flynn is a master with words and mystery. I would highly recommend this book to anyone who loves a great mystery novel that feels more like a great piece of lit than just a paperback thriller.
B008HK3XKO|2.0|THe strap to hold the case closed broke in 2 weeks.The case is already getting soft and flimsy. I would not buy this again.
B005K0HDGE|5.0|I have loved Stephen King since I was 12 years old (I am now 32, so that is 20 years of hot loving!). I remember being 12 and reading IT and having my mind blown. King continues to blow my mind with every book I read and 11/22/63 is a masterpiece. His writing style, the characters, the plot, etc., everything is amazing and interesting and if you love Stephen King, history, and time travel (not like for real, but in stories), then you will really love this book.
B003O86FMW|4.0|The first third of this book was difficult to get through, especially since the author thought it necessary to re-explain every detail that related to the first book.  Why would I read a second in a series if I hadn't already read the first.  Even without all the explanations it was slow moving.  But once you get through that, the book was as good as the first Hunger Games.  And it's a must-read to get to the third in the trilogy.  Don't you want to know what happens to Katniss??

B006MW3V6U|5.0|For all Downton Abbey fans or fans to be - another great season! You will enjoy it - some surprises!
0547884591|5.0|I bought this on a whim since I am a four hour work week fan and was curious why the lifehacking guru would write this at all. First of all it is two books blended together, and like his other books is made to be skipped around in, ie dont buy it for an e-reader. I feel that what this book really is is a collection of about two dozen of the best memory techniques,/build a proper fire/ skin a sqirrel/ pick a whiskey hacks that tim has been researching the past five years or so since his first book came out. AND a great short book on how to be a GREAT ameatur chef for cooking for your friends and family without putting the time in that is usually required. Prior to this I had a couple of unreliable unimpressive dishes that I couldnt up-size very easily. Last night, after having the book about a week and only reading 10% of the book I whipped up what by all accounts was an amazing feast for twelve based 75% on things I had on hand with a total of 20 minutes of hands on time. What more do you need to know?
B0035JRVR8|5.0|This movie is truly a classic. Audrey hepburn and gregory peck at their ffinest. If you like classic romantic movies look no further. They sure dont make them like they used to!
B00B2V66VS|5.0|I love this game! It is way better than the original temple run because I was getting a little bored with that. It has zip lining, cliffs water falls mines stuff like that! I am addicted to this game
B00AREIAI8|5.0|I love this cute little game! Great for horse lovers. Play is very smooth also. I would definitely recommend adding to your app collection :)
B0094BB4TW|4.0|This is a good app.  I love facebook so it makes it easy to get to it.  Was disappointed that I cannot get to some of the slots on facebook.
B006MW3V6U|5.0|I cannot believe how superb this show is, the costumes....the hair.....the scandal....the romance....the history!  I was an instant fan and looking forward to many seasons to come...
B0002VFXFE|5.0|I received the product promptly and followed the manufacturer's application suggestions as discussed on the Artic Silver website.I am running an Intel 3570k processor with a Cooler Master 212 Evo and idle temperatures are averaging 34 degrees C during the break in period. Very satisfied with the results.
B005WUHAX8|1.0|I had an Otterbox for almost 2 years, and it has been great. I bought the Lifeproof case because I heard it was a highly-rated case, was on Amazon's editors' top picks list, and watched some videos about it. IT IS HORRIBLE. The screen cover is flimsy and makes it almost impossible to type. The side buttons are very difficult to press, and it is a pain to plug in the charger or headphones. The headphones, especially, because it requires you to bring around the special head phone jack and you have to unscrew the cap every time. I don't trust this case, and I hate it. I am very disappointed in my purchase, and I immediately ordered another Otterbox case the next day.
B009RH9J7W|5.0|I love this case, it's just perfect. Looks great, feels great, works great! Nice leather. I appreciate the revolving ability to stand it landscape or portrait or upside down (when it's charging).
B00AQ3K8IU|5.0|It took me a couple of days to really get into this book ,but boy when I did, I did not put it down. It has a little bit of everything...romance, suspicion. I was sitting  on the edge of my seat from page 50 on! Definitely would recommend!
B0090SI4HO|4.0|If each star is worth 20 points then this movie earns a solid 80% in my book. I am quite frugal when it comes to shelling out my money for 2 hours of entertainment  so I feel I have gotten my moneys worth seeing it on the big screen. There is plenty of old school action done very well, but I was not to crazy about the car chases/stunts. I can suspend belief for alot of things but the Corvette doing a complete 180 at breakneck speeds and continuing in reverse at 70(?) plus miles an hour is too ridiculous and unnecessary. Must have a bullet proof tranny and driveshaft! There was already plenty of cool stuff going on so the movie didn't need that \\"Fast and the Furious\\" style of automotive stunt work. However the car chase in the cornfield was pretty cool!<br />  Arnold plays a likeable guy and the villains are suitably ruthless enough that you want them to meet justice in an ugly way. My date thought the main villain was \\"hot\\" so of course I was glad to remind her that he was beat up by a 65 year old man. Granted it was a very large 65 year old man.<br /> This is the type of movie that will probably find its home next to \\"Roadhouse\\" on cable TV and I  do not mean that as an insult. Making a good action movie is an art form as legitimate making the next \\"Gone with the Wind.\\" I do not see alot of credible actors that will be able to fill the the shoes of Arnold, Stallone or Chuck Norris . There isn't alot of character development going on in this movie, but at least it isn't paced like a video game(like the Crank movies.)<br /> It was good seeing Arnold back on the big screen again. If you enjoyed \\"Raw Deal\\" and \\"Commando\\" You will most likely not regret seeing this movie. I got exactly what I wanted and expected out of this flick. No Oscar awards here, but a good solid action flick!
B0050DIWFC|5.0|I would recommend this book to others.  Good story and writing was good.  Very popular at public libraries and waiting lists are very long this is why I finally purchased it.
B005LAII08|5.0|What I expected and arrived as promised. What my son was expecting and it looked just like the picture. Nice
B00B2V66VS|2.0|I thought it was very fun and cool then it stopped working and everytime I try to play it again it goes to the homepage and I reinstalled it but it wont open soooo I don't like it anymore

B004U8ZH8S|5.0|I loved this take on the Rapunzel story! The heroine and hero are fun characters and the villianess is so crafty. Maximus and Pascal just add to the fun.

B009E3EY4M|5.0|I am always wary of concert blu rays because they usually emphasize the video effects rather than the music and the performance. This was not the case here! As a Zep-o-holic I could not have been more happy with the disc.<br />It brought back great memories and was a  phenomenal show that was ageless. If you are a classic rock fan, you need this in your collection !
0810994739|4.0|i bought this book for a young man who is trying to start his collection of the wimpy kid books.  I got everything i was expecting from the service, and he read both books during a 4 day weekend.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|this is proraly the best horse game in the universes. I really enjoy my horse named beauty and EERYTHING else
B0042KA4VO|5.0|The Vampire Diaries is my favorite TV show! I read the books that it was based on, and even though the show is nothing like the books, I think it's better! I would recommend this to anyone and everyone. It's too good not to watch!
1858705231|5.0|We couldn't locate one of these in the US, so I found this one and man, did it fit my wife's hopes and expectations! RUSH stands alone, but to have this to go along with the memory of the concert is priceless.
0425263916|4.0|Don't let the title fool you, I really enjoyed the book. The only problem was that it was kind of a let down after reading the first book. The first one was full of passion and quick emotion that left you wondering where it was going to go next! It was an awesome read, but when I read this, I was really disappointed in how it went down. I feel like this one was full of suspicion and fights and doubts and wasn't balanced out by how much they care about each other. I was hoping to feel that their connection was deeper and stronger but i didn't feel that. I would recommend this series by Sylvia Day because she is a fantastic author and these books are pretty good.
B0095VP8D4|5.0|A couple months ago I decided to finally build a custom gaming PC. I first decided to go with Intel processors but then realized that AMD offers competitive processors at a fraction of the price.<br /><br />Everyday I use this processor, I become more of an AMD fan.  The stock fan is extremely quiet, probably not that effecient though. It's been keeping my CPU at around 40 °C, which sounds high but my Toshiba laptop with an Intel processor as been clocked in the 60's sometimes.<br /><br />If you compare this CPU based strictly off of price to an Intel, you'd be lucky to get an extremely obsolete i-3 2.2Ghz processor that would move at a snails pace. Now compare this AMD CPU based strictly off of performance to any Intel, and you're probably looking at a locked i-7 3.3Ghz processor priced at well over $300. So is this a great processor? It's an amazing processor. Is it at a great price? Compared to Intel, its a steal!<br /><br />I probably wont overclock this process, heard rumors that people have gotten it up to 4.6Ghz though. I'll consider overclocking in the future.<br /><br />I wanted to add that I made the mistake of building my machine around my motherboard, so I was stuck with an FM2 socket. If I could do it all over again, I would of built my machine around an AMD AM3+ processor. But I'm still extremely happy with this processor, and can't wait to try large format games on it like Battlefield 3 to see if it can withstand the performance.
B004LWZWGA|4.0|The was in excellent condition, and arrived very quickly. You gotta love the prime service. I would recommend this movie if you are a Batman fan. Probably not for small children under probably 8-10.
B002QBS9KE|4.0|I am hearing impaired and the Voyager isn't always loud enough.  I got these because I needed the bases.<br /><br />I peel off the rubber disks and mold the bases into custom silicone earplugs.  Now the headset is louder and people have to remind to take it off - it's that comfortable, now.  If you make your own as well, remember to drill a vent hole from the main channel to a point outside of the ear.  This keeps pressure and vacuum out of the ear canal and reduces the bass inherent in a closed ear piece.
B0020MKTOS|5.0|IN modern day life this is how different the generations are. There are some that are going to take from others as well as trrying to think they are all that matters.
B00AREIAI8|3.0|my 7 year old likes this game.I found it to be a lot of dead ends to earn gems but keeps her entertained.
B007QUUJMG|5.0|Being looked upon by fellow school kids as a &#34;freak&#34; is never easy growing up.  Meet Charlie, a kid intrinsically good hearted with deep-rooted morals.  Wallflower? Well in some ways, yes, but Charlie's letters to &#34;a friend&#34;  let you into his life and his battles.  Supported by a bunch of friends with their own issues, Charlie makes his mark in the group in his own, if not right-field, way.  I found this book compelling, touching and, in short, amazing.  I would definitely read this book again.
B0018LUEL0|5.0|its a realy great disc y very glad whit this i love ladytron is a special music for me .
0679746323|4.0|The authors should be commended for their searches with thousands<br />of documents around the world. Really untold stories. It would be excellent<br />if the book has a glossary of names.of poeple and places in  Chinese!
B004BLJQOK|5.0|My title may be a bit too light-hearted for this film, based as was the Swedish film on the Swedish novel \\"Let The Right One In\\".  This is a dark, dark fairy tale, a sort of modern-day unedited version of a Grim's Fairy Tale wherein the creature that swoops in and saves the child in peril happens to be a vampire.<br /><br />This version, which IMHO is the technical equal of the Swedish version in every respect, is more of a dark romance (insofar as there can be \\"romance\\" between a preteen boy and a vampire in the body of a preteen girl).  Both young leads are brilliant and I see nothing but success and possibly Oscar nominations and actual wins ahead of them if they can keep their heads on straight in a way that other \\"stars\\" who begin as younsters have failed to do, especially the exquisite Chloe Moretz.<br /><br />I won't rehash the basic plot on this review, as I did on my review of its Swedish counterpart.  I will say this:  I am likely to watch the Swedish original as an \\"alternative\\" to the usual fare on Halloween night, while I might watch this version on Valentine's Day - \\"My Bloody Valentine\\".  My suggestion to all my fellow fans of sanguinary cinema is to add both of these to your collection, posthaste.  You won't regret it in either case, especially if your taste (or blood thirst) runs to things that are off the beaten path.<br /><br />Cheers.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|wow I love this game. I love it so much .wow wow wow wow wow wow wow wow wow. buy it .
B00935KWWO|4.0|having each of the accounts in your stream be a different color is very helpful. I do like it better on my phone though.
0395389496|5.0|I used to have this book as a child and I loved it - the illustrations are amazing and magical to a child. I was so happy to get this for my 3 year old son at a great deal on here. He loves it! The edition we got was an anniversary edition that came with a cardboard cutout ornament as well, but just the plain old basic book is still very special!
B006MW3V6U|5.0|my friend told me i must check out. i watched the first episode and then spent the rest of a sunday watching the first season. gorgeous costumes, settings, jewelry, manners.
B008XK69S6|4.0|Almost perfect but could use an option to hide or remove folders, albums, or files on demand.<br /><br />Add a trash can butto to drag files or folders to.<br /><br />Other than that it is an excellent player.
B00005JNS0|5.0|this is a good one, of course. my son watched this about a kathousand times. we love it. Cars 2 is pretty terrible
B00B2V66VS|5.0|Temple run 2 has a better graphic, a better place, and a better picture.<br />P.S.- I recommend you get this!
B0026NZR98|5.0|perfect for quiet time, or having it on in the background while you work or lounge. i do love this movie, though some of the parallels to the evolution of modern man are totally obvious
B000SEGUDE|3.0|There are about six novels in this book, and I wish the author had chosen one or two of the plot lines and interwoven them more deeply.
B000JBWWRY|5.0|all kids love this classic story. it's fun for everyone in the family, nothing scary and nothing to give the little ones nightmares
B0050DIWFC|4.0|Enjoyed the story and would recommend it.  It had an interesting twist and held my attention.  Found it to be a great beach read.
B008CP93S0|3.0|it's fun for all of the expected reasons, including the cast, but because of those very same reasons, it's just ok
B003O86FMW|5.0|Just as awesome as the first book.  I'm starting book three next and I'm sure I won't be disappointed.  GREAT book
B002OR0RP0|5.0|the sequals to ice age have all been pretty decent but this one is the best in my opinion. son loves it
B000F8O35U|5.0|you have to like the little mermaid, at least a little. a bit dramatic of course, and my son is scared of Ursula and won't watch it anymore, but he'll outgrow it. i didn't anticipate he'd be afraid of her. some hilarious moments involving an overzealous chef and our friendly crab
B00APUQJLO|5.0|I really enjoyed watching this movie, despite the horrible reviews. I did not find it boring at all, in fact quite the opposite. I think Robert Pattinson was fantastic in this movie.
B003QS9VYE|4.0|dumbo is one of the classics so you sort of have to show it to your children, but i've never been a huge fan. it's very short!
0345803493|4.0|Not as good as the first book of the trilogy. ending is weak. Looking forward to reading 50 shades freed.
B003QTSMXE|5.0|this movie is fantastic! i'm always asking my son to watch this, whether he wants to or not. adult humor and kid fun
B00AZRBLHO|5.0|After seeing Gene Kim speak @PuppetConf 2012 (in San Francisco), I was intrigued by what this book might be.  I believe this will be another classic in the evolution of writing on software development.  The approach (illuminating the concepts via an actual *story*) is unique in my limited experience, and really made it easy to map the concepts onto my organization. The narrative is heavily biased towards the Ops side of the DevOps continuum, so if you're a dev like I am, it provides some insight that might be missing from your day-day life.  If you're Ops, you'll probably find yourself feeling right at home.  The Three Ways (read the book find out  ;) ) seem to be applicable from the lowest to the highest levels of work (for example: from an individual Dev all the way to the CIO), both in Dev and Ops, and will change the way I think about how I do my job.
B004JMY312|5.0|i remember this movie fondly, but it's a little corny now that i'm an adult. anyway my son was scared of this movie, he's 4
B006LSZECO|5.0|It's been a long time since I've read a novel that really is a &#34;page turner.&#34;  One surprise after another and I didn't want it to end.  Now Flynn needs to work on a new ending.
B000MKD9P6|4.0|fun, light, easy movie to like. meryll streep will always make any movie a million times better. somehow i like this movie a lot
B005K15SPG|5.0|I had already purchased the original Sigh No More a year ago but saw that this had a Live edition, plus DVD. If you're a fan you will be very pleased.
B003Y5USF0|5.0|my son is way into tornadoes, so this was a fun one that's not so scary for my son. just entertaining
B005SCSL56|5.0|This book was  the greatest book I have ever read. The more I read the book the more shocking and adventurous the plot got. I was so shocked that froggy was Charlie charming
B000ICZD4I|4.0|there are some funny moments in this, and a sense of nastalgia somehow. the tearful moments are what i try and avoid but this is a great movie
B00AIQP9DE|4.0|So far into the game you do have to pay to continue playing, which I decided to do. Game has good graphics and interesting storyline but was kinda short in comparison to other games of this type.
B009WO7NQO|5.0|I don't know about past purchasers of this game, but my experiance has been great! I recieved the whole game with purchase, all worlds and levels included and did not have to pay extra for anything. So previous issues must be resolved.The game looks and plays great on the Kindle Fire. If your an Angry Birds and Star Wars fan I highly recomend!
B007YQ6SYK|5.0|The most peaceful and relaxing music i have ever heard. Amazing voice. When i first heard him was on the jimmy fallon show. Was truly touch in the depths of my soul. If you dont like Michael Kawinuka home again album then you need new ears; cause the ones you have are broken.
B0002WZTOI|4.0|I bought this as a demonstrator DVD to use with a new Home Theater sound system, which worked fine. Good sound, good photography. Much better than my old tape version. When I ordered, I ordered from a  &#34;Blue Ray&#34; order site, which I did not receive.
B00992CF6W|4.0|It's a really great app. But... just 2 things would be awesome to add:<br />1)to change between creative and survival<br />And<br />2)add flint n steel to the creative selection. I would like to go to the nether on creative so I don't die... Lol!&iexcl;!&iexcl;
B001OGWY1W|5.0|great price I wish it would load the digital copy to my pc though the movie is very good and I enjoy movies

061831105X|4.0|The seventh Paddington book includes the following stories: A Bear at Sea, Anchors Away, Paddington Buys a Share, A Visit to the Stock Exchange, Paddington in a Hole, Too Much off the Top and Paddington Steps Out. My favorite of these are Paddington Buys a Share, A Visit to the Stock Exchange and Anchors Away. In this adventure Paddington comes back to England from his visit to Peru with his Aunt Lucy. While back in England he gets a job at a barber shop, buys a stock and goes to Judy's school and ends up performing in a ballet. It's your average Paddington book but I felt like it was better than the last few have been.
B005ZOBNOI|5.0|I feel much like Hazel did. I want to know what happened to the characters I've become so close to.
1846076439|2.0|The Sontaran Games is a Quick Reads book which is part of the 'Quick Reads Initiative' to get kids in the UK to read more. This book is short, only 98 pages long.<br /><br />I decided to pick up this book because it features my favorite monster of the week, the Sontarans! Sadly, Rayner doesn't quite get the Sontarans right. I'm glad she keeps with the Sontaran tradition of experimenting on their enemies but that's as far she goes. The way the Doctor and the teenaged athletes defeat the Sontarans was really lame.<br /><br />I thought the 10th Doctor was a bit out of character in this book.<br />Ex:\\"Well, no,\\" said the Doctor, and the students sighed. \\"But I am an ace private eye with a degree in detecting and a license to sleuth. I'll work it out.\\" (pg 34).<br />And<br />\\"But I know who you're looking for, now, Major Stinks.\\"<br />\\"The name is Stenx!\\" yelled Captain Skeed. \\"Stenx the Strong-hearted!\\"<br />\\"That's what I said,\\" agreed the Doctor. \\"Stinks the Strong-f-\\" He broke off... (pg 43).<br />I don't feel like the Doctor (especially 10) would say stuff like that. I feel like the author just catered 10's dialogue for the younger audience, which is all well and good. But keeping him in character is good too.<br /><br />The ending is very deus ex machina as well.<br /><br />I wouldn't recommend this one, but if I had to I'd recommend it for the younger fans of Doctor Who out there. They're really the only ones who'd like this book, I think.
B00A3NQNUU|5.0|This is the best game!  I play it all the time.  My brothers play it, too!  We love earning new dragons.
B00AN0KBJC|5.0|What a nice way to lead up to the next season.  I am looking forward to HBO's continued production of this great series of books.
B00B2V66VS|5.0|Temple run 2 is a really great game but you have to understand it has much different gameplay than the original temple run making it a different game  in the same franchise.
B00B2V66VS|5.0|great app. great view on kindle fire! tends to freeze a bit but other than that its a great app! love it!
B004JN1CW4|3.0|Enjoyed all the books in the series. Second one was a little drawn out but glad the third summed everything up well.
B003TSEEDY|5.0|This is a must read! I felt pain an happiness for each character. I just never wanted it to end. I wanted to keep hearing about Charlie. I began to love his character,mind set, and life take. This book made me cry. I can't tell you how much I loved it.
B00B2V66VS|5.0|Way better than the original prefect sequel to an addictive game it's a bit harder than the original but again it's way better than the original
B005CRQ4GU|5.0|I love the part when Gregory asks Rowley to be his wingman.  Awesome book to read on the go. Loved it
B0094BB4TW|5.0|Love the Facebook app.  I use Facebook everyday, so it is nice to be able to use it when I'm away from home.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|I DON'T THINK IT WAS THE ONLY THING I CAN TELL YOU THAT YOU CAN ALSO PLAY MINECRAFT I'm just kidding I love this game it's so cool when you have a horse
B000MD9UJC|4.0|This is a great upgrade for the price. The LED bulb is much brighter than the stock bulb and  the batteries will last much longer. However, the tail button switch makes it a bit less bright, although more convenient. If you want, you can not install the tail cap switch and just turn it on and off by twisting the top part like before.

B00AYB1RGG|4.0|Pretty good movie but not recommended for family movie night. Moves along at a pretty good pace. Some slow spots.
B0000256VK|5.0|This is my all time favorite album. Perfect blend of guitars, synths and sound mixed to perfection. This album brings back so many memories it amazes me every time I put it on. People, places, what I was doing. It does not surprise me that the band recorded this in The Bahamas. The sound and the feel of the album seems to transport you to another place. It is an essential piece that should be in everyone music collection. I am a huge Roxy Music fan and have all of the remasters. All of their albums are unique and marvelous in their own way. I suppose this albums just means more to me as it was my first Roxy record in 1982 and I had never heard anything like them before. Sadly, if they ever got back together as a group and not just Ferry's session players on a solo album, I do not think that they can match this masterpiece. \\"More than this\\" is my all time favorite song. I do wish that they would have not omitted the fantastic B side \\"Always Unknowing\\" from the actual album. The run time is short on this album and that track would have been a great ending to the album to appear right after Tara ended.<br />Alot of Roxy purists from the 70's don't like this album. It all depends on your taste and mood. I love Roxy's \\"Country Life\\" too and give it 5 stars, Avalon is just a different direction. \\"True to life\\" is overlooked and is one of the strongest songs on the album and complements and brings the whole album together.
B00AE2IJIE|4.0|Fun movie that my teen girls and I enjoyed. We laughed out loud.  Not quite Pyxar quality, but close! I would recommend it! I would give it 4.5 stars,
B005OSUL9I|5.0|Anna Netrebko began singing Russian opera as a teenager in St. Petersburg and now has the mature voice to join the list of the greatest sopranos since Callas. As Anna Bolena, she scored a personal triumph in Vienna.
B007KLEHUQ|5.0|Excellent DVD--actually two DVDs.  One is the concert with vocals and the other is a different Jazz version of the earlier concert with just instrumentals.
B00AREIAI8|4.0|The graphics are great but the game is kind of well as my title clearly states it's a meh game its not bad but not great ether, so i would say this game is nice and that its better then some other game but at the same time its kind of MEH
B00B2V66VS|5.0|soooooo much better than the 1st one it is really really awesome and coool and its just fun and addicting
B00AMBLDEE|3.0|The Bourne Identity was startlingly good - it was everything that the James Bond series should have been but never sniffed. The second and third installments were not quite as good, but close.  And despite the understandable departures from the Robert Ludlum books on which they are base, they conveyed the thrill-a-minute experiences of the books.<br /><br />Just as The Bourne Legacy is not from a Ludlum book (Erik Von Lustbader - is that his real name? - wrote it), it is also not from the Matt Damon-Doug Liman team that made the first three movies must-see action cinema.  It's still an entertaining action movie, and Jeremy Renner and Rachel Weicz decent. Ed Norton reprises his usual detestable character.  But the plot is predictable and the suspense absent.  But hey, it's better than any Jason Statham movie (guilty pleasures, all of them).
B00AQ3K8IU|5.0|I am an avid reader of historical fiction, so it was a change for me to pick this book. From the very first page, I was hooked! I COULD NOT put this book down. Colleen Hoover brings you right into the despair and lasting effects that trauma early in life creates. When events such as these brings her main character, Sky to her lowest point, she finds love and and redemption with the help of Holder, an old neighbor who was aware of her distress. This story is about life's curveballs and how to overcome and rise above!
B004DM0UII|5.0|I couldn't be more pleased, so many stations to choose from (including several pagan stations), with an easy to use interface.
B0064X7FVE|4.0|Its weather, what can I say? I like that I can check the weather somewhere that I am visiting. Basically the same thing that is on the television, minus the people.
B009HEJXFS|3.0|some decent parts but for the most part not nearly as good as the other two.  a lot of the effects looked a little less convincing for this one also.  was he budget lower?
B007HACDLK|5.0|Loved the story - he writes books you can't put down till the last page. No one does it better!
B005HSL626|2.0|It won't let me slice in the middle of the game I love the game but that one mistake it always tells me to close it too
B0027MJU00|4.0|Flynn really helps you get into the mind of her characters by delving deep into the psyche. Anyone who has hard a traumatic experience in their life can deeply connect with Libby as she faces her demons and choices. Great read.
B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|I can't find the words to explain how much I enjoy th<br />is season.  Keep up the excellent work.  Thanks
B006LSZECO|5.0|This was the first one of Flynn's books that i read. If you like surprises and twists in the plots, you'll love this one. Keeps you guessing to the end.
B009E3EYS8|5.0|I've been waiting over five years for an official version of the Led Zeppelin 2007 reunion concert.  The film easily exceeds the concert footage of the legendary file THE SONG REMAINS THE SAME.<br /><br />Sixteen songs on two cd's,along with the film itself, with an additional 16 on a bonus cd from a full scale rehearsal should provide most Zep fans a good fix. Seeing the three surviving members and the immanently qualified Jason Bonham, John Bonham's son, is a view of four maestros at work!<br /><br />Sadly, this will most likely be the only reunion concert ever. If you're an original Zep fan or a curious newcomer, this package will be a worthy purchase.
B007W8S2MG|5.0|IT IS definitely a fun game and infinite ways to explore the world.<br /><br />IT IS a must have for vita system.<br /><br />Only thing bugs me is sometimes the conversation is way too long and I am just too tired to go thru every sentence with them.
B00A3NQNUU|1.0|this app bothers me in three apps. the reason why I am getting it is because so it would stop bothering me.the apps are royal revolt and ninjas jump and subway surfer
B00992CF6W|5.0|This is the BEST POSSIBLE game on the whole entire kindle!!you should definitely get this game.$7.00 dollars is definitely a good deal
0316017922|5.0|I reccomend this book to anyone. I have re-read it at least 4 times. Malcolm has such a talent at breaking down concepts and linking everything together.
B000JQUMPI|5.0|little women is a nice book. i recemend this book to girls (maybe even boys) who love wonderful books.(oh,i also enjoyed Little Men.)
B003UBTX72|4.0|I enjoyed this book very much mostly because, as I suspected, Keith is a gentle, intelligent, sweet man who's life's mission was not to let the blues die. The man would play with anybody,  at any time, anywhere. He would play with people that very few people have ever heard of, just to jam. I get the feeling if he hadn't made it big, music would still be an important part of his life. This is illustrated by the fact that for years and years, after writing so many hits that sold in the millions of copies, he and the rest of the Stones got ripped off time and time again because of dishonest managers who skimmed the money right off the top of the Stone's earnings.<br /><br />He is an honest, lovely man that feels extremely comfortable in his own skin. I got the feeling that throughout his life nothing rattled him and he always was just about one of the happiest men I've ever read about. Even after he had been thrown in jail, and was convicted and sentenced to  10 years on drug charges, he seemed to take it in stride, I feel that shows his amazing strength of character. Genuinely happy people are so rare in this world and I honestly believe that Keith has always been one of them. I think that is what impressed me the most about the man.
B00A8ECU24|5.0|A perfectly sweet way to entertain the kids.  My two daughters ages 8 and 16 yrs old both love this game.  I originally downloaded it for them onto my kindle, but admittedly I play it more than they do.
B00B2V66VS|2.0|for a few hours this was my favorite app, but now it doesn't want to load at all. click.... waiting.... back home...
B00AREIAI8|4.0|I like it, I just need more neighbors. Ah well. we'll see how long iI play it. Lol hm m
B009T3AE1Y|5.0|I was kind of confused through the whole thing, but I think it was one of robs better things :)
0689853491|5.0|This is a favorite among the kids in my preschool and I just love it! It arrived in great condition. Very happy!
B001ED7C58|5.0|Came in perfect condition, nothing was wrong with it, amazon got it to my house pretty quick and...i love it a lot, so if you want it is worth the money
B00AQ3K8IU|5.0|Riveting. Heart stopping. Soul grabbing. Breathtaking.<br /><br />Colleen Hoover has done it again but this time on a whole new level. Falling in love with Hopeless was so easy and so painful. I am an avid reader and have read so many amazing books but this one....touched me, grabbed me, and pulled me in. I'm not sure I even have the words to finish my review right now.<br /><br />Full review to come. :)
B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|This season is as good as the other two.  Can't wait to see what happens next.  Need to free Mr. Bates!
1589795474|5.0|the kindle makes this a great addition.i like reading and this book is one to have..use it,try it,,learn from it
B0093H8H8I|5.0|An easy &#34;install&#34; on an ITX motherboard when the motherboard is not in the case. This CPU is inexpensive for the CPU power that it has.<br />The CPU fan is very quiet!
B0051UP5NQ|5.0|this is the ultimate. you got to have one when you look at documents. this apps lets you modify them. now i like this,works great on a KINDLE
B00AIQP9DE|5.0|from the moment i started playing this game i couldn't put it down.  the graphics was awesome and i love the storyline.  i recommend this game to everyone.
B009VSW15Y|4.0|did not know what i was getting but i am satisfied.try it ,there are so many apps for the kindle
B007VUA7VO|5.0|Works great! I would suggest it to anyone who had a droid, smartphone, iPhone or tablet. I like the way it breaks down how much time you will get out of your device for each function.
B007SGLZP8|3.0|I am a big John Grisham fan, but this book is just OK.  It reads like he thought he had to produce a book for whatever reason and is not up to his usual great writing.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|Once I started I could not stop reading it. I am reading for book 2. Awesome book, loved it! :)
B000FC11A6|5.0|Mr Stephenson's weaving of generations into a a cohesive and at times hilarious whole makes for a fabulous read. His usages of metaphors and similes shows a depth of the language that few other, if any, American authors display. I would say anyone reading it for the first time; stay with it, it just gets better and better.
1416562605|5.0|I had images running through my mind the entire time. A lot of Bond Indianesque characters kept popping up. I envisioned Ashok played by Pushkin(Living Daylights). Ashok, as Pushkin, had positives - unlike his associates. Then Vijay and Gobinda(Octopussy) played Balram and, perhaps, Mongoose. Actually, Gobinda could have been any of the thugs.<br />Easy to read, suspenseful, educating. Could not stop.
B0054JZC6E|1.0|This game does not even deserve one star. As soon as the app opens, I knew it was useless immediately. Title very misleading...100 games not even close! As soon as I found out that there is really only 10 games and that points were needed to unlock more I knew only the designers<br />would benefit.  Actually they should have named this &quot;Money to Waste&quot;. Buying 'points' is a big red flag to hit DELETE! Avoid this game like the plague!
B001BR3P0S|5.0|Truly a classic. Have watched this one over and over and over again!!! Downloaded it to my daughters kindles, so they now watch it constantly! :)
B008Y2FRFO|5.0|I really liked this game. I used to love this when I was little and my sister took me to the fair. Takes a long time for coins.
B0063IH60K|5.0|I sit in the waiting rooms waiting for appointments and play this game.  It always starts up conversations cause the want to know what I'm doing.
B007BFSYMS|5.0|White Noise includes lots of different sounds for all tastes.  Whether you like sleeping with waves crashing on the beach or urban traffic outside your window, this app offers it all.  There are timer features built in as well.  What more could you ask for?  Obviously, if you are using this on a phone or tablet, the sound is somewhat tinny with the little speaker.  I'll bet this would sound great docked with some small external speakers.
B007VUA7VO|5.0|I love this app... it's very handy as it shows a lot of information on your battery use and how long it'll take to charge. I've installed it on my kindle fire hd and have had no problems whatsoever. I totally recommend it!
1582701709|5.0|I loved this book so much and true to its words.  I ordered this book for every family member and friends I know.  They all love it.

B003O86FMW|4.0|The second book of the Hunger Games trilogy was even better than the first book and the first book was awesome. Can't wait to read the last book.
B00B2V66VS|4.0|I really enjoy playing this but it just isn't the same feel as the origanal temple run. A lot of the things are the same but I cant find a sensitivity setting so its kind of slow with turning and leaning. Also you cant slide down in mid jump.
B00A0SQBDM|5.0|Great story line and easy to follow instructions. I even still play it over and over again when I get bored.
B009H5IS1W|5.0|love this show! good video feed and good sound quality, uploaded quickly. I would purchase online again. just missed one episode.
B003JTHXOK|5.0|I so can't wait till it comes out on DVD.  Couldn't put it down.  Kept me wondering what was going to happen next...
B0043UB0BQ|5.0|A fantastic piece of art from the late Aussie. A true representation of Italy and the Empire. Cant wait to get season #2.

B000FC2L1Y|5.0|Please keep these OUTLANDER series novels coming. I can't get enough. Even though some of these books are over a 1000 pages, I can,t stop rereading the entire seriers.
B00B2V66VS|4.0|Fun to play, beautiful to look at, all that jazz. I hadn't played the first temple run in quite some time, but it's hard to argue with a free download. Looking forward to whatever is next.
B00A9X9TIW|4.0|One of the better new release movies. It was a good action movie with great actors. I enjoyed watching it.
B003TSEEDY|3.0|was a great coming to age story.....but very vague on little details in the story.... the ending was rushed and left too much to the reader to fill in the holes<br />dont want to see the movie now would be a double let down.
B007B6VOG0|5.0|I love this entire album! Definitely goes right along with all this &#34;new age&#34; music that is coming out and I love it all!
B00ADS90EQ|5.0|Just watched Pitch Perfect.  Such a great movie that everyone should see ASAP! Everyone is guaranteed to enjoy this film.
B000VWYJ8G|5.0|Excellent movie...don't know why I waited so long to see it. Full of intrigue and action packed. Any spy or conspiracy type movie fan should see it.
B0017SWSCW|4.0|An ancient theme brought up to date with believable twists.  The usual engrossing Jeffrey Archer page turner which makes one look forward to his next novel.
B0009Q0F5U|5.0|I love the cd and this completes my Battlestar Galactica collection.<br />The condition of the cd was great and the sound was great.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|I wasn't sure I`d like this book, but I could hardly put it down. An ironic twist on the \\"reality\\" shows which are so popular on TV.
B0089EHWQE|5.0|This is our book club choice for February.  Beautiful love story.  This story really tugs at the heart stings.  Highly recommend!
B000CNE092|5.0|I was concerned about getting this version of the video after reading the reviews.  However, I love it and I'm really happy with it!
B0063IH60K|4.0|The only reason that I am giving this four stars and not five is because of the fact that some of the personalization features seem to just not work. They have the ability to apparently have your own card backs and your own board, but I couldn't seem to get it to work. I tried many different pictures and the feature just wouldn't work. Maybe because of the fact that it's free, but the fact that it was there and it didn't work disappointed me.
B0017SWPXY|5.0|This was very enjoyable.  Loved how the story developed - tellling of the story from the dogs point of view - indeed, he was telling the story.  The characters developed beautifully, so much so that I could picture in my mind what they would look like.  The story line kept getting more and more involved, until I said, &#34;How much more can this man take???&#34;  I couldn't stop reading until all the storylines were resolved, and I have to say I loved it.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|My horse is so far out. He's so cool. I love him. He's so pretty and awesome. Best app ever.
B006MW3UZW|5.0|Amazon has nade ordering and viewing movies and tv shows so easy. I watched this on my laptop and loved it. This show is a high quality program that the entire family can watch. This is my most loved tv show ever. I watch it over and over.

B000FBJFSC|5.0|This was a real good book! I had trouble putting it down. It was a constant reminder of how blessed I am. It got a little dark and depressing at times, but overall a GREAT read!!!
B00AREIAI8|4.0|This game is quite fun, I work at a barn so I know what it is like! It follows pretty true but if y'all are true house fans I suggest getting out to a barn and setting what it is really like, it is not as easy as it seems!
0061547840|1.0|Why expect that Trump would actually have something valuable and usable to share? This book is just an excuse to stroke his own ego.
B0071XO8RA|5.0|Great read.  I could not put this book down.  Originally, I was going to just get Wool 1 but took the advice of other reviews and got 1-5. So glad I did!!!  I will be going back to this author.
B0063IH60K|5.0|I am a huge fan of solitaire, this game is challenging and fun, it helps spend the time in something other than everyday items. A great chance to get away from stuff and have FUN!
0345803493|5.0|I loved this one the best. I felt like I was apart of the story, line I was really there. I felt rich and elegant! Wishing so badly I could be in Christians and so bad. A must read!
B007IXWKUK|5.0|I read each book and this book was very good. I would recommend the books to everyone, something different to read and a great discussion starter.
0345803485|5.0|It was definitely not what I expected! When I first heard about these books I thought it was all about sex. The story line is so captivating I could barely put the book down. Good thing I have a baby to take care of because I probably wouldn't set it down. Definitely highly recommend you read it!
B00785P2QC|5.0|Super fun can not stop playing. Every morning I wake up and turn it on. This is a great game , get it!
B003PBB4ME|4.0|This thing is awesome, It looks cool, gives me the option to add lights/mics to my camera, and does stabilize while giving some better angles.<br />Theres one somewhat big deal downfall. Where it should connect to the tripod, the screw is slightly too small, so the tripod can only screw in part way, and it'll wiggle if you touch it. For me, I got this because I was tired of tripod, so its not a issue.
B00ATDOVNK|5.0|Pretty cool game. Wish i could find more games like it. A little freaking when things pop out at you, but other than that , still great game
B004P1JEXE|3.0|This book is not as good as the first 3.  Some of the main characters have been dropped, leaving one to wonder what has happened to them, eg Bran, Rickon, Hodor, Tyrion etc.  Some chapters are entertaining, but some are repetitive and rambling.  I will continue to read to the end though!
B0064X7FVE|5.0|Excellent, I use this every day.  Much easier to use than<br />the one on my phone etc.  Highly recommended. HD
B004P1JEWU|5.0|This book continues on with all the characters from the first book.  A real page turner - one that you don't want to end.
B004SIIBGU|5.0|I use this app often and truely believe it is easier<br />to use than the access on my computer.  Amizon,<br />keep up the great work.  HD
B007KOYEOC|3.0|Nice story line, but apart from that a bit like Mills and Boon, but once you start one book you have to keep going to find out what happens.
B004Q7CIFI|5.0|This work confirms that Stephen King very well might be the greatest writer of our time. And, if you think you know the ending just from the little bit of a hook about what the book is about, think again. Just when you think his story is finished, he has lots more to tell you. What King's protagonist (Jake Eppling) goes through to change history is chilling and has you on the edge of your seat every moment. A very difficult book to put down, and one you won't easily want to see come to an end. I hope it makes it to the big screen!
B007KZY1YY|3.0|Same comment as Fifty Shades Freed. Mills and Boon like but, it still has a story to tell and you want to find out what happens next
B00AREIAI8|3.0|Pretty good. Can't get the competition tab to work though...it's pretty entertaining though and so far I've just kept playing.
B005LBF7CY|5.0|Anyone that likes Danielle Steel's books should read this. I just liked the characters and how their lives seemed like everyday life.
B00B2V66VS|4.0|This is a fun and fresh new way to play Temple Run. I, personally, haven't had any big problems, like freezing or crashing. The only thing I've encountered is a timelapse glitch where I'm running on a straight path and the next I'm finding myself at a sudden turn or tree trunk ... It hasn't killed me yet, but could end up being a problem for a lot of people.<br /><br />Four stars because it is fun and challenging, but there's that weird glitch ..
B002MQYOFW|5.0|I love stories that revolve around strong young women. A gorgeous tale that leaves the reader hungry for more. I enjoyed this very much and I even saw the movie first. I will be finishing the rest of the series very soon.
B003TSEEDY|5.0|I have read many books in my life. So far, this is the best book I've read. It's extremely relatable and at the same time inspiring. This book is considerably crucial to the typical tween or teen. It symbolizes so much more than rebellious, free-spirited teens. It resembles the dramatic change from teen to adult. This book is written in a beautiful manor. I will definitely read another novel by Stephen Chbosky.
B009PJ1Q82|3.0|*** This review may contain spoilers ***<br /><br /> While attending a recent screening of 'Keep the Lights On', director Ira Sachs indicated that the title of his new film about a gay romance spanning approximately ten years, refers to transparency, or lack thereof. An additional theme he revealed is that the characters are trapped in a masochistic relationship.<br /><br />The film begins as we're introduced to Erik, a documentary filmmaker from Denmark. He's basically supported by his father (much to the chagrin of his sister) who criticizes him for not having a regular job. Erik has just broken up with his lover and compulsively seeks out physical encounters with other gay men, using phone hot-lines (the film begins in 1998, at the time when phone hot-lines were beginning to be phased out, due to the rising popularity of the internet).<br /><br />Mr. Sachs holds little back in depicting the sexual encounters Erik has with strangers as well as his new found lover, Paul, a literary agent. They're not completely explicit but there's a raw immediacy, which gives the film an authentic verisimilitude--a peek at gay life that outsiders rarely are privy to.<br /><br />Sachs wisely chronicles the dichotomy of Erik's personality. On one hand, he's almost irrational in his obsession with Paul, ignoring the obvious reality that Paul is a drug addict and is rapidly going downhill. Erik also keeps a lot of things to himself and there is a lack of communication between the two lovers (that lack of transparency that Sachs alluded to during the recent screening I attended). On the plus side, Erik is deeply concerned about Paul's welfare and is instrumental in getting him into an inpatient program.<br /><br />While Paul has to struggle with his demons, Erik gradually makes good on his promise to become a successful documentary filmmaker. He wins a 'Teddy' Award in Berlin, after garnering acclaim for his documentary about a gay artist from the 40s and 50s, who Erik in effect, rescues from obscurity.<br /><br />The tension in the plot is bound up in guessing whether Paul is going to make it or not. After Paul returns from rehab, there's a great scene where he disappears for a number of days, and Erik and his friends have no idea where he is. When Erik finally finds him at a hotel, it's obvious that he's had a bad relapse. Erik hardly seems surprised when a young man comes over to have sex with Paul. Instead of getting angry and feeling betrayed, he accepts the fact that Paul has relapsed and holds his hand while Paul has casual sex with the stranger.<br /><br />'Keep the Lights On' slows down considerably in the third act, as Paul seemingly is much better after a few years and is now able to work. Erik's attitude has changed toward Paul, who has kept away from him for about a year. When Paul gives him an ultimatum--either break up or find a new home and live together--Erik, perhaps now realizing that their relationship has run its course, chooses the option of dissolution.<br /><br />Erik's obsessive love for Paul does eventually become tiresome and of course the point is that Erik must go through a process of self-actualization before he realizes he's been in a masochistic relationship. Nonetheless, Paul's breakdown and Erik's efforts to help him, is the best part of the picture. And yes we also want to know what the ultimate disposition is of their relationship.<br /><br />Director Sachs' portrait of Erik is of a gay man who is not isolated from the rest of society. He has female friends and well as straight male friends, and despite flights of sexual compulsivity, Erik comes off as someone who is pretty much part of the mainstream. In that respect, Mr. Sachs ably argues that gay people should not be considered 'outsiders', but ordinary people, who are no different than the average middle class straight person.<br /><br />A good part of 'Keep the Lights On' is strangely compelling. Will Paul overcome his addiction? Can Erik remain in the relationship, despite Paul's chequered history? Erik's 'love at any cost' obsession with Paul is necessary to show his self-destructiveness but by the same token, remains unexplained and goes on for a little too long. Some judicious editing, to make the film slightly shorter, would have helped. Nonetheless, this is a film that is definitely worth a look, not only for a few nice twists and turns in the plot, but the particularly strong performances from Thure Lindhardt and Zachary Booth, as the gay lovers, whose relationship reaches its nadir and then unceremoniously, fizzles out!ationship, despite Paul's chequered history?

1455519006|4.0|This was an enjoyable read. The main character, Robie, reminded me of an older version of Jason Bourne. In this case, Robie knows who he is but is a killer with a conscience. The only thing I couldn't get used to was the name of the main character. The name \\"Will Robie\\" didn't sound strong, tough, and sexy enough for me. Other than that, no complaints. Easy reading, suspenseful, and although the twists and turns were sometimes predictable; it was still a fun ride.
B0089EHWQE|5.0|This book takes you &#34;behind the scenes&#34; of a person living as a quadrapalegic, and the relationships that are affected by that injury.  Great book for a book group as there is lots to discuss.
B00A7OJ0DC|5.0|I must say, this movie sort of blind-sided me. I expected it to be much more of a \\"hey look, famous character!\\" type of film. But I was pleasantly surprised.<br /><br />In honest truth I saw the movie solely based on the huge poster with Sonic the Hedgehog at the front of the pack. The advertising campaign did not do the film justice. But after watching the film (over 7 times I might add, gotta love the $1 theatre), I realized that it is about an original character on his own journey, not just a cameo-fest. Albeit there were many cameos, but they were subtle and didn't take away from the plot of the movie. For example, in some scenes you can see graffiti on the wall with stuff like \\"no campers\\" or \\"Sheng Long was here,\\" and in one scene there is a wall in the background with hand-drawn pictures of many famous characters like Tails Prowler and Galaga, which give a little thumbs-up to the people who recognize them. Some things, like Hero's Duty, can look very similar to another game like Halo in appearance, but not story. If anything that helps to familiarize the audience, otherwise it just comes off as a generic space marine. The most surprising part to me was how well the actors and actresses filled their role. Typically I don't like Sarah Silverman because she is a rather crude comic, but she makes a completely believable and endearing character in the film, ironically becoming my favorite. Another important note, the 8-bit animation and the score for the film are outstanding. I felt like I was really in an arcade.<br /><br />Overall, the animation of the film was smooth, the visuals were pleasing and not too flashy, the story had a solid ground built on true plot mechanics with some unique arcade-themed features (such as the surge-protector gateway), good soundtrack, and the cast of appealing characters. I guarantee you will find at least one character you like that IS NOT a cameo. Adults might not find the movie nearly as enjoyable (I'm 21) because a lot of it revolves around the hero of the film making his place; perhaps unrelatable to older generations. Although I personally believe it is a universal theme. From a film-student's point of view, there are subtle things throughout the movie that only adults will understand; a classic Disney trademark.<br /><br />It was a light-hearted adventure populated by some comedy, cameos, a little romance, some tragedy, good action, and a \\"finding yourself\\" theme.<br /><br />P.S. Perhaps not as important, but I actually stayed to watch the credits, every time, because the music and 8-bit animation are just as entertaining as the movie.

B008MF3OEY|4.0|Much better quality than the last Verso Kindle case I ordered (which is supposed to look like a Composition notebook, but is of extremely poor quality)...<br /><br />Once again, however, the securing straps are *incredibly* tight (albeit elastic), and I think there is too much extra material in the spine. When the cover is folded over completely, I'd rather have the case be slightly triangular in shape than completely flat: in this product, the flatness means there's a \\"lip\\" of cover that overreaches its mate. I'm not really sure how else to explain it, but it's annoying.<br /><br />Still, I'd consider using this one for light-usage situations (I *do* enjoy that it looks like a book, after all.) For everyday handling: Otterbox.
1423140605|5.0|\\"The Mark of Athena\\"<br /><br />They just keep getting better. I have always loved mythology, and Rick Riordan has the ability to bring it to life for the reader.  In \\"The Mark of Athena,\\" Riordan begins to really bring together the two camps from the earlier series: Camp Half-Blood from the Percy Jackson series and Camp Jupiter from the new \\"Heroes of Olympus\\" series.  Now all of the young demigods must work and fight together to save the world from evil.  Some of the most popular characters from both series must now face the evils of the Earth Mother, Gaea, while having some other Roman demigods attempting to thwart them.  There is greater action and character development as the reader learns more about our heroes, especially Annabeth. This is a masterful book which leads the reader right to the brink ---. Now, all of his fans must wait together for the next installment: \\"The House of Hades.\\"<br /><br />This series is a must read if you like mythology.  I am trying to get my younger grandson reading more and I have been giving him the Percy Jackson series. Read the series in order; otherwise, you will miss the development of the characters and the situation in which they live, and you will certainly miss an understanding that goes with it.

B004SHED22|2.0|The only redeeming thing about this book is the incarceration of the jews in paris and the misery they endured.  After that, I think the story becomes boring and predicable.

B00B2V66VS|2.0|I was real exited when I found out Temple Run 2 was out.I downloaded it on my kindle fire and played a little that night.But the next morning I tried to play it again.I opened it,it stayed on the load screen for a bit,then it sent me back to the home menu.After it did this several times, I tried to reinstall it.BAD IDEA!!!After I uninstalled it,my device still thinks it is installed.If I tap on the icon it takes me to the appstore,where no matter how many times I tap &quot;open&quot; it won't open.I give it two stars because it lasted one night.Fix my problem, and my opinion might go up.

B006ZAZ31U|5.0|Fearless by Eric Blehm is a story of redemption and love. The book is a biography about the life of Navy SEAL Team SIX Operator Adam Brown. One of the highlights of this book is that it tells the bad and the good of a national hero who gave his life for this country. If you only read about the first twenty years of Adam Brown's life you would see the sad story of a kid who fell into all sorts of trouble and eventually ended up with his parents seeing him arrested. We are blessed though to read the whole story and learn about the power of forgiveness and unfailing love. All of this leads to Adam Brown being a highly respected and loved SEAL member. The kind of guy that anyone would want on their team.<br /><br />The surprise is the other heroes in the book. America was blessed with such a warrior because of the unfailing love of his parents and wife. As you read the accounts of how his wife pursued and believed in him while they were dating you can not help but be convicted of what it means to truly love. I am a father of three girls and if my daughter came home with accounts like Kelly Brown I would flip out. However God led her to support her boyfriend and husband through his battles of addiction. In Kelly Brown we see the love of Christ and picture of how Christ stands with us and helps us grow. You will be blown away as you read the accounts of the heroes in this book.<br /><br />Whether you are a husband, wife, parents of a wayward child you will find hope and encouragement in this book. For those who have made some bad choices you will find encouragement that all is not lost and that there is always hope to start fresh and new.<br /><br />Followers of Jesus Christ, you will learn what it means to love and how difficult it can be at times to love.<br /><br />Men you will see a picture of strength and gentleness. As a man I strive to have the gentleness that Adam Brown had with his family and the courage he exhibited in the battle field. He exemplifies what it means to be a man an not because he was a Navy SEAL but rather because of his controlled strength.<br /><br />Women in Kelly Brown you find a beautiful example of a godly woman who supported her husband. Although difficult she always believed in her husband and fought for him.<br /><br />In the end through this story of redemption we see how a life well lived leads to having an impact long after we have died. The truth is that for some much of the fruit from their life will never fully be seen until they die. Praise God for His redemption of  us in His son Jesus Christ. God can use any of us to do great things for His Kingdom.<br /><br />Pick up Fearless by Eric Blehm today.<br /><br />Read Chapter one of Fearless<br /><br />I received a copy of Fearless by Eric Blehm for free from WaterBrook Multnomah Publishing Group for this review.

B006LSZECO|2.0|The premise of the book and the contrived story was depressing and without redemption.  A real downer.  Would not waste my time unless you like feeling hopeless.
B00B2V66VS|4.0|It's a great game but they to fix some glitches.<br /><br />I can be in the minecart and if I crash and try to use a &quot;save me &quot;, the game crashes and brings me back to the home and plus it takes my gems.<br /><br />Also I can run down the trail and when the track gets thin in one part of the track,I can jump but somehow my character jumps to the side and instantly falls off the track.<br /><br />Therefore the game is great but it needs some fixes to be the best.
B0061PEAUY|4.0|Interesting and more unique than the last few novels by Reichs.  I always enjoy learning some new facts but the basic story line Brennan steps outside the investigation, gets into life threatening situation, and is rescued is getting trite.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|I would recommend this series to ANYONE; and I can't wait to read the next two books to the trilogy!
B007THA4FI|3.0|A decent first Post-Potter book for an \\"no kids allowed\\" audience.  Sort of a depressing soap-opera story, but the characters are well written.  No matter where you live, these people could be your neighbors or even \\"friends.\\" Makes you think...you never really know what goes on in the homes or minds of others...

0374533571|5.0|Pat Peoples believes his life is a movie.  Movies have drama and sadness but in the end there is always a silver lining.  For Pat the silver lining is reuniting with his estranged wife Nikki.  However at the start of the novel Pat comes home to live in the basement of his parents house in South Jersey after spending time in a mental facility.  Pat believes he was gone for a short time but he soon realizes that his family and friends lives have seemed to have changed much more than the few months he thinks he has been away.  No one mentions when or why he went into the facility but it seems to be connected to his wife who he has not seen since before being committed.<br /><br />His Mom hooks him up with the best therapist in the area, Dr. Cliff Patel, who helps Pat get reintroduced to life on outside of the \\"bad place\\".  His best friend Ronnie hooks Pat up with his sister-in-law, Tiffany, but Pat chooses to just be friends as he is waiting for Nikki to welcome him back at the end of his movie.  Tiffany like Pat struggles for mental stability after the death of her husband and provides Pat with the only connection that truly understands.<br /><br />Matthew Quick gives Pat a very authentic voice of someone struggling to reconnect with his family, friends and himself.  Through Pat's eyes and thoughts we share in this struggle to rebuild or rather build relationships with his mother, father, brother, therapist, his new friend Tiffany and ultimately his beloved Nikki.  Each one is touching, sad and quite often funny.  In the background we also share his family's and friend's  love of the Philadelphia Eagles who also seem to struggle and never make it all the way.  Pat believes he has been given a second chance at the same life he was living before he left to be a better person \\"practicing to be kind rather than right\\".  Does Pat's movie end with the silver lining he believes will come?
B0086700CM|5.0|No wonder it swept the world!!! This is an amazing app!!! This is my favorite game ever. The directions are really simple. Using your finger sliding it forward, backwards and to the sides, you make one of seven characters junp, duck, and turn. When you first start, you will try the tutorial. This will tell you how to jump slide turn and grab coins. Then you are ready for the real game.<br />  There are power ups and utilities to help you play the game and earn more achievements. Achievements are given as you collect a certain amount of coins or points. They are also given for different levels of power ups and how many power ups you get per run.<br />  Technically you are running from a bunch of monkeys mad at you. You are running as fast as you can. That I  why they have the store for you  to purchase things with the coins you have collected while running. There are more characters and power ups. There are also utilities. All of these you can find as a bargain.<br />  You can get extra free coins from downloading other apps. An add will pop up when you are on the play screen right after you open the app. These will only sometimes pop up. The games they recommend are always free game  like this one.<br />  In the store you can hit get more coins. You can purchase more coins with real money. They will give you the option on how many coins you get. Select the coin amount, and you can start this purchase.<br />  Another way to get completely free coins is you like them on Facebook  or you follow them on Twitter. You get 250 coins that way.<br />  This app is really fun and I am glad it was a total hit.<br />  I &#60;3 TEMPLE RUN !!! :)
1451695195|1.0|95% of this book is about Dr. Alexander's illness and his proof that his consciousness did exist outside of his body when his brain stopped working.  Although he said that he had complete knowledge of all sorts of things Dr. Alexander does not share any of this with the reader.  Absolutely no new insights.

Well thought out system of incentives including table shake, prizes (which can be sold for coins), walls, puzzle pieces, levels, extra XP towards level ups, giant coins which shake the table and more.  You can play for free and allow coin supply to regenerate automatically or just buy more.
0316228532|2.0|Okay, I knew this was not a children's book, and certainly not going to be \\"Harry Potter\\" for adults, but I was surprised and disappointed by \\"A Casual Vacancy.\\"  Without revealing the plot or going into detail for those who may want to give it a try, I can say that at first the sheer volume of foul language in this book was disappointing.  I am not a prude, and I am not overly-sensitive to bad language, and given the right situation and company, I can swear like a sailor.  However, this book is literally \\"f*ing\\" this and \\"c*nting\\" that every other sentence.  I felt like Ms. Rowling went out of her way to show the world that this was \\"a book for adults\\" by making the language so foul that even the most liberal-minded person would not want even their adult children with earshot of the language in this book.  Now, I realize that Ms. Rowling may have been attempting to accurately depict her characters, but I really felt the use of bad language was more than gratuitous, and that it was filler for lack of more plot or character development.  Does all of lower class England curse non-stop? My second largest problem with the book was that ALL of the characters were extremely difficult to like. Even with the more sympathetic characters, you had barely a glimmer of understanding of their point of view before you found yourself not caring about them again a moment later.  The only character that I liked was the dead guy (Not giving anything away there, as that happens in the 1st chapter.)  I did manage to make it through the whole book, but I would certainly never want to read it again.  I would recommend this only if you were really curious to see what Ms. Rowling's non-Harry Potter offering is like.

B008XBCJ34|3.0|It seems to be the standard in Hollywood that Humans suck, unless they are socially perfect left wing liberals, for which case they are defined as evil people that need to be destroyed or re-programmed to the left. They must believe everything that the left says and act in every way that the left does, even if it goes against there principals AND MORE IMPORTANTLY IT FLIES IN OPPOSITION TO CLEAR THINKING LOGIC. This is only political because every damn movie, no matter how good the construction and execution of the movie MAY be, seems to be designed to just show how intoerant we are unless we could only be as tolerant as the INTOLERANT left. No other view is possible if you would be deemd to have a RIGHT to exist.  Witness this human hired to do a job that, if he did it as he was supposed to, everything would have turned out okay. But what does he do, he follows his heart, falls in love with someone from another species, embraces this and repudiates his own humanity as repugnant to him. They in turn embrace him, not for his differences, but rather his ability to lose himself into there culture as superior to his own. Sounds nice , except it shows an intolerance in the the ones who scream intolerance so that we all must go along to get along. I believe in humanity and not socially-engineered automatons. We have laws to prevent in justice and we don't need to do anything more than to ENFORCE those laws. A mode of behaviour that seems impossible to comprehend by the left, unless it suits there cultural agenda.

0785132619|5.0|This is my favorite comic series. The movie was by far one of my top three favorites, and I would say the comic was better! (Hating to be that person to say the book was better). The plot points definitely drove the story and made it a lot more of an improvement.
B00AREIAI8|4.0|This is a great game with great graphics!  It has everything you would expect in a good house game but I wish I had control on rising so it's like I'm actually trying to ride a horse!!!  I also wish that it was easier to get gems.
B00280LYIC|5.0|Rick Riordan did a great job on the Lightning Thief. I really like books with adventure and things that make you catch your breath and this is one of them. You will definitely like this book!This is an awesome concoction of Greek Mythology,(Which Rick Riordan must have studied  a lot.),fantasy,and adventure.Not only that but it has a hint of worry, love and anger of a boy for his family. So enough with reading these reviews and start reading this book. Caution: It will be hard to put this book down. Have a great time reading!

B004PR71JC|5.0|My daughter and I jam to this cd every day on the way home from school! The cd makes it easier to take from one car to another!
B00AREIAI8|5.0|Very good I recommend it for farm kids you need to  know how  to take care of a horse before getting one
B00B2V66VS|5.0|Temple Run 2 is just a really awesome game in general. In several ways it's much better than the original. I applaud the makers - sequels aren't easy :P
0307596885|4.0|I found some of these well-crafted stories about unusual characters in<br />odd situations a little frustrating, as it's hard for me to understand<br />why the main characters behave as they do -- what are the limitations<br />that lead them to choose the men they do, or the lives they stay in?<br />I wouldn't expect to like them, from the description, as they're set<br />in small-town Canada, mostly in a vague post-WWI past, which<br />sounds dull, dull, dull, and in most of them nothing much happens.<br />The last few stories, which the author announces are semi-autobiographical,<br />were the most authentic and heart-felt.  I'd love a whole book of those.<br />This is my first book of Alice Munro stories, and I will certainly<br />read more.<br /><br />Anybody who loves well-written short stories should find these enjoyable.
B0083GQVOC|5.0|Watching this right after Newtown might have been a bad idea. I don't believe in spoilers and don't pretend to be a reviewer. I liked it.
B008AK8FHM|5.0|Wonderfully Written and Easy to Read. For me it was hard to put down. I would recommend it to others.
B008GXHOFW|4.0|Swinging in the spider web, going on the blimp, fighting the bad guys.  The game is awsome.<br />It is super cool.
B009IEXKXI|5.0|Great book, I enjoyed the detail and well written style of the book.  The thing you need to know is there is a lot of science and technical detail which many people, especially those who do not want to learn by reading, will not enjoy.  Did he really need to tell us how to make air from rocket fuel?  No, but he did and it was interesting.  Worth the read but my one thought to Andy, you do not need to use the f-word to make your point.  I have yet in my 55+ years on this earth found a reason to use the f-word, there are so many other words which work just as well.  Still, good read, glad I bought it.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|I love it.  It is fun.  The mystery boxes are cool.  We like the Ninja and Spike.  We like the Hoverboard and the Mega Headstart.
B009T3AE1Y|3.0|In trying to figure out why this film By David Cronenberg fails to work it is probably best to return to the original novel of the same name by Don DeLillo. The story's  themes - `power, technology, violence, terrorism, crowds, the movements and counter-movements of contemporary culture - are those of White Noise, Libra and Mao II. The setting, a contemporary yet futuristic New York, is familiar terrain. Stylistically, too, it's business as usual. The protagonist Eric Packer isn't someone we're meant to engage with. A running motif is his contempt for last week's big thing, especially technology. Skyscrapers, airports, phones, walkie-talkies, personal computers, vestibules, automated teller machines, assassination attempts on presidents: he finds them all comically outdated. His own gadgetry, with its flashing monitors and flowing numbers, works in another time-frame, bringing events before they happen and giving them a sharpness they lack in \\"real life\\". Doubt and ambiguity aren't concepts he understands. He sees himself as the future - and thinks that when he dies the world will end, not him. Packer is less a character than a cypher, a symbol of dystopian triumphalism. If he doesn't seem \\"believable\\" or \\"realistic\\", so be it: the words have no meaning in the world he inhabits.'<br /><br />So given the cerebral dysfunction of the novel, it is a bit easier to cope with the ennui of this film. Riding across Manhattan in a stretch limo in order to get a haircut, Eric Packer (Robert Pattinson, in a monotone, phoned in `performance'), a 28-year-old billionaire asset manager's day devolves into an odyssey with a cast of characters that start to tear his world apart. The characters are basically tropes that are attempted to be inhabited by such fine actors as Samantha Morton, Juliette Binouche, Sarah Gadon, Paul Giamatti, Juliette Binoche, Kevin Durand, Mathieu Amalric, Jay Baruchel, etc. The film begs indulgence on the audience's part and it takes a certain mindset to make it through to the end. It has the makings of an interesting movie, but gets off track very early on. Grady Harp, January 13ke it through to the end. It has the makings of an interesting movie, but gets off track very early on. Grady Harp, January 13
B003TSEL7S|5.0|When this book first came out, I was thinking that it wouldn't be able to top the Percy Jackson series. I gave this book 5 stars because, it was exhilarating and adventurous. Once I finished, I kept reading it over and over. I realized that this series would be more dangerous and adventurous then the Percy Jackson series. I would totally recommend this book to anyone who likes a myth/ adventure story.
1423140605|5.0|My daughter wanted this book W A Y before it came out.  She was # 327 in line for it at the library.  We purchased The Mark of Athena for her for Christmas and she LOVES it!
B008HK3S9K|4.0|I wanted something to protect my Kindle Fire.  Very good strong materials that appear to take portability well.  Wish it had a additional pocket well designed for the stylys and the cord for recharging.  Those two items will need to be stored separately as there is no room, could be, but NOT THERE.  Otherwise- well done.
1423136802|5.0|My daughter has read and re-read these books several times but still wanted her own copies.  She was thrilled to receive them,  and is reading them AGAIN!  :o)
B00AREIAI8|5.0|Awsome game! Like the graphics. Simple and fun to play. Allows you to interact with other people while playing, which is always a plus.
B00AREIAI8|4.0|I love how you get to play with the horse and do things that you would normally do with a real horse
B00A8ECU24|5.0|this game is the best it is perfect for your little girl!!!! if you like my little pony it also a game for you
B00AIQP9DE|4.0|I like the G5 family of games and this one has a great mix of puzzles, hidden objects &amp; strategy. Buying the full version for only $2.99 is not too pricey. Fun game
B00B2V66VS|4.0|I like this version of temple run. But personally i liked the old Temple Run better. Yes this one is not a cartoon like the old one. On the old Temple Run I unlocked more stuff than i am on this new version. I dont hate this version i just do think its better than the first Temple Run. I give it 4 of 5 stars.
B0058YPILY|5.0|I watch criminal minds on a regular basis.  The episodes never go out of adventure,  I have all of be seasons, except season 8.  When I do receive it I will review it !  Lone this show!
B004SJ3AXI|1.0|Just as boring as all the angry bird games.Made for little children.I took it off of my device after only a few tries.
B00AREIAI8|4.0|its ok but it has a few minor glitches concerning the friends page and competitions. it is quite a fun game otherwise... Ps friend me! I'm AnimeAb with whitedeath(soon to be changed to bambi)
B008MF3OEY|5.0|I am absolutely loving my unique and beautiful kindle cover.  It looks like an old fashioned book and is just what I was looking for.
B00AE2LJVS|4.0|The quintessential American tail. it was as if I was watching a story of my own life wrapped up in a movie.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|Just downloaded today. My 4yr old daughter and I have been playing it for hours, so realistic, fabulous job. Reminds me of having my own horse when I was a teenager.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|this game is really fun! it actually feels like I'm taking care of a horse. the traffics are incredibly good. I highly recommend this game
B004MC8CA2|1.0|Might be a good bible but I could not get into the plans.  Would only open to Genesis.  Reloaded land that didn't help.
B001UV4XIS|5.0|This item was purchased for a stocking stuffer for an avid Harry Potter fan.  We didn't try out the included digital version of the movie, but the DVD works great and came as expected.
B00005JM02|5.0|Pixar has produced a stunning animation with a timeless message of love, adventure and letting go. For adults and children, itis a great addition to your DVD collection.
B007TBZ63Y|5.0|I loved The Mark of Athena except for the 2nd to last chapter can't wait till House of Hades comes out.
B003WUYRGI|4.0|Muy bueno este diccionario y práctico espero me sea útil porque tengo que darle un reciente si todavía no lo uso
B00AAQRNQ8|5.0|I have had this mouse for about a month, plenty long enough for me to judge the durability of the mouse, i'll try to write as in-depth of a review as possible!<br /><br />Design/Ergonomics:<br /><br />5 Stars, but just barely, here is why:<br />*The mouse takes a while to get used to, but after that, its incredibly comfortable<br />*The multi-color logo (my favorite part) gets covered up by your hand when you are using it. I don't see the purpose in it.<br />*The button placement made me wonder at first, but after about 5 minutes of using it, i fell in love with the buttons on the side. The ones next to the click wheel? Not so much.<br /><br />Build Quality:<br /><br />4 Stars.<br />*The actual build quality is very good, expecially at this price point. Its lasted me a month without any problems, i don't see it breaking any time soon<br />*The weight: Its too low, it makes the device SEEM cheap, the plastic on the mouse doesn't help with that asthetic<br />*The buttons, the mouse wheel, all are fine. I would prefer a smoother mouse wheel but thats just me<br />*The braided usb cable is my favorite part, its plenty long and its gonna last<br />*Gold plated USB? Ehh. Its a feature none the less but its mostly just a gimmick<br />Why does it get knocked off a star?<br /><br />*I don't know how long its actually going to last, between the lack of weight and the plastic-faux rubber build<br /><br />Actual Use:<br /><br />Easy 5 stars:<br /><br />*Response time is amazing<br />*Its very accurate<br />*Software lets you tweak almost anything. And its intutive. Yay!<br />*Very comfortable to use<br />*Very responsive, takes almost nothing to move it<br /><br />Final Quirks/Suggestions for Anker:<br /><br />*Ditch the weight cartraiges. I put all of the weights in there when i first used it they haven't been used since<br />*Add more weight, it'll make it feel more durable and expensive<br />*Save some money, ditch the programmable lights. The user's palms covers it up anyway<br />*If you ever make another one, don't hesitate to charge more if you ditch the plastic. Its one of the things that is holding it back<br /><br />**Anker was kind enough to send me a mouse but in no way, shape, or form did they have any influence on this review. Everything that was protrayed here was my opinion
B00B2V66VS|2.0|I liked the game until it force closed on me. It has done this to me 6 times to me allready. I liked the original version better.  No wonder It's free!
B006LSZECO|5.0|This was very good!  Another book I couldn't put down.  I couldn't believe the ending.  As soon as I finished it I picked up the phone to call my friend and discuss it with her!!
B005HSL626|5.0|I love this game and the kids really enjoy it as well. I would recommend this game to anyone. fun for all ages.
B008D28HYS|5.0|It will make you think! It can get frustrating at times but if everything was easy it would not be worth the effort.
B00AREIAI8|4.0|I recommend it to hose lover's or people who care for horses, or train them. That's really all you do.
B006LSZECO|5.0|This book made me think.  It seemed so predictable as it started out, but then the plot took big swerves one way and then the other.  I read it fast, and thought it was an interesting experience book.  .
B005HSL626|5.0|my 8 year old said that fruit nija rules and i agree . keeps us busy for hours and hours
B00A9X9TIW|5.0|This characters in this movie are as rough as the future they inhabit.  Kinda typical dark apocalyptic scenario. Jaded people/world doing what they do to survive.  Finally someone chooses to make a change and affects everything for the better.
B0064TVQ5E|4.0|fun &amp; challenging &amp;frustrating, too many symbols look alike, so sometimes it's a little hard on the eyes, but always fun
B00A6PD9I4|5.0|The movie is charming from beginning to end.  Lot's of comedy.  The music is very nice.  Every character is well a character.  Really shows the pitfalls of selfishness and the harm is causes our relationships.  There is restoration when we choose to do the right thing.
B004ASNG04|2.0|An OK but I didn't finish it.  I found that the author belabours far too many points and goes off on tangents in far too many places. Compared to e.g. Collapse or Guns, Germs, Steel by Jared Diamond, its a poor comparison IMO.
B006YXTRHY|2.0|The acting is so bad and the pathetic heroine (if that's what she could be called) really beg the question.  Why are these so popular?  Belle's character is so emotionally weak and clinging it is really sick.  What does this movie say to young women?  Nothing of value as far as I can see.
B0037471TE|4.0|So long as one suspends a fair bit of belief, this is a very good book to read.<br /><br />Struggles in a few places where the pace falls off, and some rather dangling loose ends here and there (I assume subsequent books in the series pick up on these).<br /><br />A tad long IMO for the content, but good nonetheless.
B0063GORYU|4.0|Easier to use than Windows version. Advertising is easy to accommodate. Thanks&nbsp;for developing this app. I may have to join Spider Anonymous but it would be worth it.
0307719219|4.0|I enjoyed this book a lot. An interesting theory and very well written and presented work. Is probably not the best in the genre (to my mind) - I still like Diamond's books better myself - but good stuff.
B008220D5K|1.0|Could not believe how tedious and boring this movie was. What I thought was a comedy turned into a long (LONG!) and uninteresting drama.
B004KBSQOW|5.0|THe cd is really good. Just want I was looking for. Thanks for the CD and the services was good also.
B0065CCM76|5.0|An amazing compilation of Seger's best songs and then some! It is absolutely great having them all on one album. Go Listen!
B007W4OZ76|4.0|Dig this explorer/file manager - super great functionality and compatibility with my Kindle Fire.  Not very user friendly, though.  Needs better instructions; and it could use to have the data for different file's default locations, for the Kindle Fire, programmed into it , as well.  All around, a great &amp; powerful file manager, if you have time to fiddle with it; not for beginners, or those looking for ease-of-use right off the bat.
B005I6EU7U|5.0|It's so pretty! I get compliments on it all the time! If you like books, you need to get this.
B007SGLZP8|3.0|I actually would give it 3 1/2 stars.  It was enjoyable, but I have liked his other books better.  He had too many surprises that weren't predictable.
B0045H6V8Y|4.0|Very good movie, held my interest throughout.  Would recommend it to anyone who likes adventure, romance, and excitement.  I would watch it again.
B007J4T2G8|5.0|This book was better then I thought. I thought it would be all sex but it really is about love.
B005HSGB6W|4.0|Great book if you can follow the english slang..loved it.I saw the movie when i was about 8 while a babysitter watched with me.
B0054JZC6E|5.0|I love this game,  it's fun when your bored. There are so many games you can play,  even though you have to play some games more then once. it's. interesting to see what other little games there are.
B0063IH60K|4.0|I like this game, but feel it could be a little better.  I never seem to know when the game is over.  I wish it would signal when there were no more moves.
