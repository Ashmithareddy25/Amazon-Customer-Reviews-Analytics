B00005B36H|5.0|This flawless album is by far the most complex artwork we have seen in recent music history.  Every song flows into the next, taking the listener from peaks to valleys.  It is impossible to rate every single song on its own.  This cd is not one where you can skip to your favorite track, because the true essence of what TOOL's music really is about will become blurry.  The lyrics are amazing, the drumming is amazing, the atmosphere is amazing, and Maynard's voice is the most beautiful, yet haunting, voice in music today. Please do yourself a favor and pick this cd up, listen to it in a dark room, and be ready to be blown away. I never thought music could change a person's whole life perception until I gave this cd a chance. Thank you TOOL.<BR> <BR>&quot;Recognize this as a holy gift and celebrate this chance to be alive and breathing.&quot;
B0000648WZ|4.0|A film by Paul Verhoeven<br />\\"Starship Troopers\\" is a look a very different future.  Democracy has failed and the world is united under a fascist regime.  This film is not about the differences between democracy and fascism (though there is mention of this), but rather this needs to be mentioned because this is the underpinning of what sort of society we are dealing with and how it has shaped the characters.<br />We open with a brief propaganda video (which we will see different versions of throughout the movie).  The purpose is to instill national pride in the citizens.  From here, we move into a high school setting where we meet our characters for the first time.  Johnny Rico (Casper Van Diem), Dizzy Flores (Dina Meyer), Carmen Ibanez (Denise Richards) and Carl Jenkins (Neil Patrick Harris) are about to graduate from high school and they are deciding what to do with their lives.  For various reasons, they all decide to enlist in the military (service guarantees citizenship, according to the propaganda video).  Johnny and Dizzy are infantry, Carmen is to be a pilot, and Carl goes to military intelligence.  For the first time in years, the four are separated.  Carl disappears from the movie at this point, but we do follow the other three.<br />The big war the military is fighting is that against the bugs from Klendathu.  These are nameless, faceless insects (though large and extremely dangerous).  Though Johnny and Dizzy are being trained to fight against human opponents, we know that war will come against the bugs.  And it does.<br />While \\"Starship Troopers\\" looks like a B-Grade sci-fi movie, it is much more enjoyable than that with a bit more depth.  Even though this is more background than anything else, we get to see how a fascist society might have developed into and what sort of citizens it might have turned out.  \\"Starship Troopers\\" is also a straight up sci-fi flick with humans in a war against bugs.  The movie is a lot of fun, fast paced, and while I didn't care for it much the first time I saw, it has really grown on me.  I don't know how well Verhoeven skewers fascist regimes with satire (as what the stated intent of the film), but this film can be intelligent as well as just an action packed ride.<br />-Joe Sherrydidn't care for it much the first time I saw, it has really grown on me.

0385510438|2.0|I consider myself a huge Grisham fan. I thoroughly enjoy his writing but I also notice the decline in substance of his material. Lack of new material? Boredom? The Last Juror is not up to par with his first few published books, notably, A Time to Kill and The Firm, books I enjoyed immensely and couldn't put down. This book I was able to walk away from for days without missing it. It was disappointingly predictable and at times, annoying.  I was extremely annoyed by the ease of the main character, Willie's life even though he tried to make us think it was so difficult and painstaking at times.  Things just seemed to fall into his lap without much effort. Poor Kid &lt;insert sarcasm&gt;.  Willie's relationship with Miss Callie although I applaud Mr. Grisham's attempt to prove racial tolerance and acceptance by his main character, I was annoyed by the blatant stereotypes in which he wrote his black characters. Even though he had all of the Ruffin children earning doctorate degrees, you never saw any of them actually working, especially the women.  They were always in the kitchen cooking and their husbands were almost obedient little children. The women always rushed to the kitchen to cook or get food and this is one of the typical Aunt Jemima stereotypes of black women (including being extremely over weight).  It was not believable to me that Willie would have been as accepted to the Ruffin family as he was in the book, or that he would have taken the time to be a family chauffer or mediator.  Willie laud and loathed Clanton in the same chapter and by the end of the book we really wasn't sure how he felt about living there. Not Grisham's best and it seemed he was reaching for a story here. I think its time for me to retire him.

1400031354|3.0|After reading Alexander McCall Smith's first book in this series &quot;The #1 Ladies Detective Agency&quot; I felt I had to read the following books as well because they are so enjoyable.<br />&quot;The Tears of the Giraffe&quot; reads almost like a fable allowing us to determine whether or not lying for good or bad reasons can be wrong. It is an interesting delimma. I absolutely enjoy the way that Smith writes his characers. Precious Ramotswe, her secretary/assistant Mma Makutsi and her fiance Mr. J.L.B. Matekoni are immediately likable and often shyly funny in the way that they interact with one another. This book brings two orphan children into Mma Ramotswe's life and leaves a door open for the next installment. <br />The ending of the book is left with a wonderful fable-like suggestion about baskets being woven from the tears of a giraffe because that is all they have to give us. We can all give something no matter how small or insignificant it may seem and Alexander McCall Smith has given us a true treasure here.
B000002AGN|5.0|Dave Brubeck met with Paul Desmond to create an album whose sole purpose was to be an experimentation with odd times in jazz. It resulted in a classic hit single, and opened the doorway for experimental avenues in jazz and other music through the use of shifting meters.<br />Go figure.<br />&quot;Blue Rondo A La Turk&quot; is here, in its 9/8 glory, with that amazing slink into 4/4 blues(gotta love Eugene Wright walking that bass!) we all know and love. &quot;Take Five&quot; will always be remembered for that crazy Joe Morello drum solo and snaky sax line, all with Brubeck's classic 5/4 vamp underneath it. Other gems are present as well, from the easy/laidback &quot;Strange Meadowlark&quot; to the silly time changes of &quot;Kathy's Waltz&quot; and &quot;Pick Up Sticks.&quot;<br />This is a great jazz album for newbies to jazz, with it's fun rhythms, upbeat nature, and excellent technical performance(just enough to keep things interesting without going over the top). A classic if there ever was one--with popular sales and critical acclaim to boot.
B00000373U|5.0|Elliott Smith's music is so sincere and brutally honest that just him and his acoustic beat all those mainstream fishooks out there today. The acoustic fingerstyle does conjure up the ghost of Nick Drake. The album has great dual layered vocals on songs like Angeles and Between the Bars which are reminiscent of the best harmonies from Simon and Garfunkel. This truely is the work of a fine musician and will make a nice addition to your collection.
B00005JLKB|5.0|Trust me, you will love this if you buy it! When my friend first showed me Smallville I loved it right on the first episode! This has all the best episodes on it. You will be suprised at how satisfied you will be after watching all of these episodes! And after you watch all of the first season episodes you will be miserable until the next season comes out in dvd! Smallville is the best! There is no better t.v. series out here! When I bought the first season I loved it so much I watched all of the episodes in about 1 day! After that I was checking up on the internet trying to find out when the second season is coming out and it almost killed me. Buy it and you will be satisfied!
0790731479|5.0|Tim Burton had come off the blockbuster success of his first feature film PEE-WEE'S BIG ADVENTURE (1985) when he was greenlighted by Warner Bros. to direct the project he REALLY wanted to make. It was the picture that would define the rest of his career to this day: the supernaturally weird black comedy (and weirdly-titled) BEETLEJUICE (1988). It was so unique, so strange to me that I didn't know what to make of it when I first saw it on video in 1989. I remember from that first time liking parts of it, but not liking the picture as a whole. The movie was so frenetic, so odd in its mixture of Goth Horror, Comedy, gruesome visual effects (I'm still kind of amazed that it got a PG rating instead of PG-13) and cartoonish slapstick that I really didn't know what to make if it. Well, now that I've seen it at least a half-dozen times since (three of them in the past year alone), I can say that it has held up better than many of the most popular 80's films (TOP GUN, etc) and has become a classic all unto itself.<br />With BEETLEJUICE, Tim Burton showed not only that he could direct effective comedy and illicit inspired performances from his actors, but also bring a true artist's touch to the big screen. Of course, the film won the Oscar for Best Makeup (as if there was any real question about it), but I also think that it should have also been at least nominated for Visual Effects and Art Direction, as those truly mesmerizing aspects all come together to create a product that is so unique. Not only that, but this film helped make the careers of several actors who would go on to major success soon after.<br />Two of those actors are Alec Baldwin and Geena Davis, as the ill-fated newlyweds Adam and Barbara Maitland who, after buying a big Victorian dream house at the film's outset, die in a bizarre car accident soon after. Slowly realizing that they've passed on to the next world, they don't want to give up their house to the pathetically bourgeois Charles &amp; Delia Deetz(Jeffrey Jones &amp; Catherine O'Hara), who along with their chubby, effete chauffeur Otho (Glenn Shadix) have already moved in, and inspire true disgust in the newly-dead couple. However, they seem to have an ally in the older couple's death-obsessed Goth daughter Lydia (Winona Ryder) see an afterlife advertisement for a &quot;Bio-Exorcist&quot; named Betelgeuse (Michael Keaton) and decide that their only hope in driving out the destestable Charles, Delia, and Otho is in using the wild, unpredictable Betelgeuse. Of course, good ol' Betelgeuse will gladly provide his unique brand of service, but at a very high price. <br />Alec Baldwin &amp; Geena Davis fill their roles very well. The ironic thing is that this was the first film I'd ever seen Alec Baldwin in, so my first impression of him as the nerdy, good-natured Adam ended up being turned around by 180 degrees by the psychotic, tough-guy roles that would define the rest of his career. That turnabout came pretty quickly, actually, as the very next film I would see him in was MARRIED TO THE MOB (1988), in which he was a mobster unbeknownst to his wife who gets offed early on, but it was his psychotic turn in the extremely quirky and violent MIAMI BLUES (1989) that really shocked me and made me realize that Alec really had some range to him (unfortunately, he would be end up being typecast as psychos for the rest of his career). However, Geena Davis, herself at the cusp of stardom (and Oscar acclaim) is playing pretty much the quirky kind of character that would eventually define her career. In fact, it was just the following year that she would win the Oscar for Best Supporting Actress for playing the truly quirky and inspired Muriel Pritchett in the otherwise uninspired THE ACCIDENTAL TOURIST (1989). This film, of course, also boosted the career of the now-infamous Winona Ryder, who quickly became the hot new &quot;it&quot; girl in the late 80's with this movie and with others soon to follow: 1969 (1988), HEATHERS(1989), GREAT BALLS OF FIRE! (also 1989), EDWARD SCISSORHANDS (1990, and another Tim Burton film) and MERMAIDS (also 1990). Of course, former AMADEUS (1984) emperor and FERRIS BUELLER'S DAY OFF (1986) principal Jeffrey Jones, now infamous for his own reasons, is also terrific here, as is former &quot;SC-TV&quot; alumnus Catherine O'Hara. We also get a welcome supporting performance from the great old character actress, Sylvia Sidney, as the chain-smoking receptionist Juno!<br />But it was Michael Keaton, who was already an up-and-coming comedic actor known for quirky hit comedies such as the Ron Howard-directed NIGHT SHIFT (1982), MR. MOM (1983), JOHNNY DANGEROUSLY (1984) and GUNG HO (1986), who really stole the show and hit paydirt in the process. He would immediately be elevated to &quot;A&quot; list status with his truly brilliant, maniacal and hilarious performance as the titular Betelgeuse, going immediately on to bigger &amp; better things with Tim Burton himself, starring soon after as BATMAN (1989)! It's funny; I think that in 1988, Keaton was robbed of Oscar nominations not only for this truly unique comedic role, but for also his surprising dramatic turn as a recovering alcoholic in CLEAN AND SOBER. It just shows that, for whatever reason, comedians just don't get recognized enough for their acting ability.<br />BEETLEJUICE is a lot of fun. It looks like it must have been a lot of fun to make. Despite the liberal PG rating, I would recommend it only for ages 9 &amp; up, as the humor is quite adult and the rather gruesome visuals are likely to give any young child nightmares. It is still a truly unique movie with incredible special effects, and it still makes me laugh to this day. Oddly enough, whenever I see it, it makes me that much less afraid to die!<br />HIGHLY RECOMMENDED
0156027321|4.0|My opinion about Life of Pi by Yann Martel was completley different at the beginning of the book and at the end.  I think the first 100 pages can be removed.  I don't think they hold any real value.  There are some good points about religion and such but I just don't think they have anything to do with the rest of the story, or Pi as a person.  I guess the beginning could be a whole different story.  I enjoyed the second part of the book, though, very much.  It was very interesting to experience the detail in which Martel described what Pi had to eat to survive.  I also thought the relationship built between Pi and Richard Parker was very clever.  The ending so surprised me and if I read this book again I would read it with totally new eyes.  There is symbolism that you could have not put together if you didn't know the catch at the end.  So overall, Life of Pi was hard to actually get into but it turned out to be a very good book.  I would recommend it to patient readers with great imaginations.
0375432302|2.0|Like many other people, I bought this book simply out of curiousity. It appears to have made many waves and since I am interested in the history of Religion I thought it would make an interesting read. Far from it.<br />The characters are flat and one-dimension and the whole book is based on the so-called 'secrets' Brown reveals. Without the information on the history of the church (though their accuracy is debateable) the fact that the storyline is completely lacking would have been blaringly obvious. But even so, he obviously trusts that all his readers are as dense and uniformed on the subject matter as his character Sophie. Rather, I found myself laughing out loud every time it took Langdon and Leigh forever to figure out a 'riddle' I, the layman, had solved within seconds. Not to mention that the 'revolutionary' ideas portrayed by Brown are hardly new. I had heard most of this before at one point or another.<br />I should hope that everyone takes this book with a pound of salt.
0679745653|5.0|I picked up Breakfast at Tiffany's not expecting to enjoy, but not get very into it. After the first page, though, I couldn't put it down. Holly, the main character, is the type of person that you really want to be friends with, yet at the same time you just want to jump inside the book and yell at her. You can't help but fall in love with her even if you don't like her! I absolutely LOVED this book. If you've seen the movie, do no think because you liked or didn't like the movie you'll feel the same way about the book because they are completely different stories. Breakfast at Tiffany's is awesome! I think it might be my favorite book!

B000089RVX|5.0|Evanescence is a great band with SOME similarities to Lacuna Coil and Tori Amos, however their music is theirs and theirs alone.  Amy Lee has a hauntingly powerful voice (much more powerful than anyone in Lacuna Coil) and the rest of the band does an amazing job with the music.  The lyrics are deep and meaningful and the melodies rock.  Are you going to believe some idiot who can't even spell the name of the band he &quot;hates&quot; or are you going to believe me... who has had this CD since the day it came out (before Daredevil) and knows how to write a MEANINGFUL review?  There hasn't been an album since Pearl Jam's &quot;Ten&quot; that I could listen to all the way through, over and over again... until Evanescence's &quot;Fallen&quot;.  Trust me.  You'll love this CD!
B00005YW4H|5.0|Ms Jones'\\"Come Away With Me,' makes me want to listen to music again. In fact, when the mood strikes me, I turn off the drivel on tv and put her album on. Ms. Jones has managed to turn poetry into song and relate a compelling narrative with each song. She has managed to combine jazz -- the lounge type, where you imagine yourself in a darkened lounge, with a soft, smoky voice, and a soft piano making you think about lost love --sad country blues initially sung by the great Hank Williams, his song \\"Cold Cold Heart\\" based on the true story of his wife not talking to him when he came to see her in the hospial; and finally the right mixture of blues and modern jazz.<br />Each song is wonderful; no bad cuts here. My favorite is, \\"Come Away With Me; I have a log cabin with a tin roof in the woods and I can really relate to the lyrics. Ms. Jones also manages to do what few other singers have done, add depth to the song through the beautiful lyrics. For instance, the words\\"come away with me\\" can be interpreted literally or on an emotional level, or even universally, as well as sexual. This is typical of all her songs, which is poetry, with startinly beautiful images woven into a pattern of beautifully blended styles.<br />If you like Ms. Jones, get Daniel O'Donnells greatest hits; be sure to get the double compact set/ If you grew up loving, \\"I'll Take You Home Again Kathleen. you'll love similar recordings by Mr. O'Donnell.

B00005U11Z|4.0|Journey hits the stage in Las Vegas without legendary front-man and vocalist Steve Perry for this performance. The payoff? Let's call it even. New guy Steve Augeri is a fine singer, but you Senator, are no Jack Kennedy. Lacking the power and range of Perry (but what male singer doesn't?), some of the tunes are obviously a bit of a struggle. However, having not heard Perry sing live in over 20 years, I can't say the real-deal would fair much better on those Journey classics. Very few 70's rock stars can pull off their hey-day tunes (Robin Zander and Steven Tyler being two exceptions). All in all, Augeri does a very good job, and has fairly decent stage presence for a band of guys looking 50 straight in the face. He seems lost at times, but as this was recorded in 2001 when he was still new on the job, let's cut him some slack. (When I saw the band in 2003, he seemed much more comfortable with the role.) <BR>A quick look at the other members for this performance:<BR>Ross Valory: the guy looks like Kirk Douglas. But a more solid bass player would be hard to find.<BR>Jonathan Cain: Keyboards, guitar, and background vocals, and a fine job on all. Wish they would have performed &quot;Anytime&quot; during this show as they did on the 2003 tour. Cain did an excellent job on lead vocals. Not the greatest &quot;talk to the crowd&quot; guy, though. They do miss Perry in that respect. Some of his keyboard sounds do not seem as powerful as the old recordings, though. <BR>Neal Schon: Total monster. Enough said. Very nice guitars!<BR>Dean Castronovo: Incredible drummer and shockingly good singer. Huge asset to the band. It is no wonder Neal wanted him in Journey.<BR>The camera work on the DVD is okay. Not spectacular, but some good shots of the band. Too many cheesy crowd shots, though. I could care less about the crowd. I want to see Journey, not some guy with a mullet pumping his fist or a couple smooching during a ballad. <BR>The sound is where this DVD shines the most. A goodmix for the most part, although Neal's guitar does sound muddy at times. But overall, very good sound with various choices.<BR>I would probably give this DVD 3 1/2 stars. Three is too low, so I went with four. A good performance with good sound. I found their 2003 performance much more enjoyable, but this was a fine performance in its own right. While the new lineup certainly doesn't eclipse any older versions, I really don't think they took a step back either.
B000002KNY|5.0|Talking Heads remains one of those enigmatic bands that defy categorizing. Rock? Sometimes. Disco? No. Art-rock? I have no clue what that term is supposed to mean. Any music that has quality and integrity is, by default, art. FEAR OF MUSIC is an extraordinarily cerebral record lyrically, but musically, pretty basic. There is texture to the music but none of the unnecessary complexities or pretensions of the other bands of the era, like Rush. (Ooooh, the drummer is playing in 7/8ths time. Wow!) Having fun was just as important to Talking Heads as was being &quot;artsy&quot;. &quot;Animals&quot;, &quot;Heaven&quot; and &quot;Mind&quot; are actually very witty tunes. &quot;Cities&quot; is a romp, and, musically, pretty straightforward rock.<br />In these post 9/11 days, and with the Iraq mess still going on, the radical/activist/underground lyrics of &quot;Life During Wartime&quot; has taken on a new and eerie significance. Still, it kicks ass.<br />Talking Heads' &quot;Fear of Music&quot; is one of the band's best, if not the best. And it's nothing to fear.

1582403589|4.0|Brilliant artist Tony Moore takes a superb script by Robert Kirkman to give us a fresh retelling of the &quot;zombie world order&quot; horror story.  Inkwash over pen and ink works perfectly to convey a human tale of survival at the end of civilization.  This book is a character study with examples of courage, cooperation and compassion balanced by equally well rendered paintings of human fear and envy.  I usually walk by black and white comic books, but this one wouldn't have been as good in color.  2004 is not quite halfway over, but I doubt I'll read a work of fiction this year I'll enjoy more.
B0001CCY7E|5.0|Enough has already been written about how John Barry came back from illness to score one of his greatest achievements with &quot;Dances With Wolves.&quot; The expanded score from Epic/Legacy is a treasure.  It includes the entire score, and at a price that can only be described as a steal.  Over one hour and fifteen minutes of some of Barry's most inspired music.  The expanded opening and buffalo hunt music alone are worth the price of this recording.  Very nicely produced and packaged by Epic/Legacy, this is what every soundtrack album should be.  It is also a worthy tribute to one of the true artists in this field.
B00004X01U|4.0|madonna celebrating the year 2000 with Music, she returned to a place she wasn't for a long time. a No.1 album and a No.1 single(music) This album is extremedly different from the others, first why she went this way?????? well what girls appeared last year (1999) of course Christina and Protegge Britney. She got to do something fresh and not stay out of line. this is a mixed of Dance/techno songs with guitar ballads<br />outstanding tracks here are:<br />music , impressive instant(this one was supposed to be the 3d single instead of What it feels.... but warner wanted an new spanish song from her so was a little difficult to translate I.I. so they released What it feels...and Lo que siente la mujer) Runaway lover, Paradise, Don't tell me and my fav Gone.
B00005ATQH|3.0|I was surprised, after seeing both versions of Lolita back to back, that again and again people were calling the original a classic, even a masterpiece, while never having seen the 1997 version.  <br />The original is drab, lacking in sensuality, atmosphere and character depth.  Yes, the first hour is devoted to the household of Lo with her mother and more time is devoted to Quilty, who is distractingly entertaining in a number of unnecessary scenes.<br />Yes, Kubrick is regarded as one of the best filmmakers of all time.  But this film is proof that even artists have their limitations when it comes to theme and mood.  Kubrick has never been sexy or warm, not even perverse, as Humbert must be explored in all of these contexts as an adult in love with a child.<br />The story is about the exchange of power and affection between two individuals who should not be indulging in such an unhealthy intimacy.  It is not about Charlotte getting drunk at a party, or how many accents Sellers can provide, it is about a human connection and the audiences' judgement of that connection.  <br />It is interesting that Nabakov wrote the screenplay- when he had created such a lusty, colorful novel as Lolita.  All color, literally, is lost in the 2 act film adaptation.  Lyne made a film with vision, beauty and disturbing performances that do the novel justice.  It gives a lot for an artist to think about when the best choices for a film is other than one of the world's most renowned directors and the novel's own author . . .
B0000DD7LB|1.0|This CD is terrible and could team up with Madonna American Life. Those two women should grow up. One is OLD trying to look young and the other is an adult acting like a TEEN. Damn her music is immature and SUCKS!!! Don't buy it because you will hate it!!!!!!!!!
B000001DQI|4.0|It can be argued that the early 70's were Elton John's best era.  If you were to listen to &quot;Goodbye Yellow Brick Road&quot; you will see why so many people say this.  Elton's voice was so young and beautiful, and compositions with Taupin had a pure magic to them.<br />The opening track &quot;Funeral for a Friend/Love Lies Bleeding&quot; pulls you in leaving you spellbound. The album is most famous for the countless hit singles lifted from the album including &quot;Benny &amp; the Jets&quot;, &quot;Candle in the Wind&quot; and the title track. <br />These are excellent tracks, but the real surprises to me were the album tracks which hold up well against the chosen singles.  My favourite track on the album is &quot;This Song Has No Title&quot;, simply so beautiful. Never tire of hearing this.  It is followed by &quot;Grey Seal&quot;, another favourite of mine. <br />Like most albums, there are the odd fillers here and there, but they still represent well crafted pieces of work.<br />This is an album that deserves a place in your CD collection.
B000089RVX|5.0|This stinkin' CD has been in my CD player for months now. You can listen to every single track over and over and not get bored. Amy's voice is angelic, eerie, powerful and right on key. She gives me goosebumps...bad ones! Her new duet with Seether - Broken, from the Punisher CD is another solid gold hit. Southern alternative rock rules! U go girl!
B00005T30L|1.0|Let me guess, you think im gonna use words like &quot;gritty&quot; and &quot;realistic&quot; to describe this movie. Right? Wrong.<br />Now when I wake up, the first thing that comes to my mind is, &quot;Gee, I could really go for a depressing movie that doesn't make me feel good at all.&quot; Seriously, this movie isn't &quot;art&quot;. It isn't good. Wonder why it didn't go to theatres? The reason this movie didn't go to theatres is because it relies too much on showing a depressive girl's obsession with some loner(Steve Buscemi in his first role that I haven't liked). The fact that anyone would want to see such a depressing movie amazes me. Even more amazing, people call this movie realistic and artistic. It isn't either of those things. It's just a movie that didn't make it to theatres and didn't sell that well on dvd.<br />In the end, this movie did horrible with the critics and being depressive isn't brilliant. It's depressing and boring.<br />But of course, people will defend it for some reason because it is apparently art. Any movies that don't go to theatre are brilliant!

B000148KK2|5.0|Diana Krall is an amazing artist! I can still remember the first time I saw her perform. I saw her perform on the 1999 Grammy Awards. She performed with Erykha Badu and George Benson. It was phenominal! I was amazed! I immeadiately went out and bought her album, and I have bought every album since then. My favorite has to be Live in Paris because it captures her amazing talent, especially her piano playing. Her voice is very unique, with the mix of smokiness and breathiness. No one else is like her. I believe she is one of those artists that will stand the test of time. Years from now peoplle will be talking about Diana Krall's amazing talents, lyrically, vocally, and for her piano playing. I abosolutely love her new album. I have to disagree with everyone who complains that this album is not her best because she decided to collaborate with Elvis Costello. I think her personal and working relationship with Elvis has made her a better artist. It let her open up about very personal things. Most artists can't open up like this this early in their career. The fact that Diana can makes her all the more interesting. I would recommend her new album to anyone. Anyone who is a true Diana Krall fan has to go out and buy this album. You won't regret it!
B000001E18|5.0|Zooropa remains an astonishing abberration in the U2 catelog even a decade after its release because the band seems to have seemingly buried it - no one ever discusses the hits from the record, even though, at the time &quot;Lemon&quot; and &quot;Stay&quot; did remarkably well on the radio.  It's a darker, more cavernous take on the sounds of Achtung Baby, and it might not be the classic that album is, but it does show a band just off the heels of a great reinvention proving to themselves why they're so vital.  They're songwriting is perhaps the best it ever was, and the atmosphere doesn't drop for its ten songs - plus the Johnny Cash climax is just unforgettable.

B000002HH9|4.0|I just got this album, I have all the others except Top.  This one is defintely different than the other albums of The Cure; it actually has happy songs.  The only disappointment is round&amp;round&amp;round, what were they thinking? But it's a must have for major Cure fans.
B000063DFS|5.0|I have alot to say about this album... when i first got it, i had no idea how it would be... the only songs i knew were no more tears, and mama im coming home... but now i know there are many masterpieces on here. the album first starts with the powerful and humerous MR.TINKERTRAIN, a song that is about child molestation, but is supposed to be serious. then comes I DONT WANT TO CHANGE THE WORLD, a great song, MAMA IM COMIN HOME, probably the best song on the album, and one of ozzy's greatest ballads... DESIRE and NO MORE TEARS follow the album , both great.. these are my favorites... well actually these and then add S.I.N., HELLRAISER, and A.V.H, and this is my favorites. not that there's anything wrong with the others, i like them, but they are not as good as these... this album also shows that Zakk Wylde is one hell of a guitar player, sure he may never be randy rhodes, but he has got skill... also ozzy shows that he can write really good, and his voice is better then ever... if you want more ozzy like this i think its a mix between blizzard of ozz, and ozzy newest, Down to Earth... i love this album and i hope that you will too!!!
B000024D4R|4.0|Granted not the Floyd's best effort but entertaining anyway. I absolutely love the great long sweeping prog rock songs created in the seventies. This album is great becasue of this fact. &quot;Sheep&quot; can tend to be a bit monotonous but depending on my mood even this sounds great. &quot;Dogs&quot; is fantastic!! All 17:04 minutes are pure prog heaven! Still the best Floyd works are 1. Dark Side of the Moon 2. The Wall 3. Wish You were Here 4. Meddle 5. Animals.<BR>I first bought this on vinyl in 1977. Aside for &quot;Dogs&quot; I was very disapointed but have grown to better appreciate it over time. Now I find I play it even more than I play any of the first 4.<BR>A must buy for any serious Floydian!!
B0001ENYKS|5.0|This CD is truly a work of art.  It is a break from the mainstream pop/rock that has grown increasingly worse over time.  They have a chance to make it big.  The CD has no fillers but good tracks one after another.  The band creates there own unique sound, a mix of rock, pop, jazz, and swing.  I'm sure people will appreciate this artsy rock approach.  It is enjoyable and a good buy.  Highly recommended.
B000099T2L|3.0|I really don't know why Beyonce won 5 Grammy's for her album Dangerously In Love The album was okay and all But like everyone else said the album did had a lot of ballads and they're were only 4 uptempo dance songs on the album.When I first heard Crazy in Love on the radio and saw it on MTV I was not impressed I expected better from Beyonce but I then started to like it a bit after hearing it over and over and over again I finally caught on to it.Baby Boy Beyonce's next single Is my favorite track off the entire album Sean Paul and Beyonce make a duo.Naughty Girl<BR>is also another decent song off the album I like the original much better than the remix version with Lil' Kim and Lil' Flip.The fifth track off the album is the first ballad off the album and the rest of the album from 5-15 is basically well Ballads.Be With you is an ok track Beyonce even hits the high note hich kind of surprised me a bit.Me Myself and I is another great Ballad and it really is an anthem for women.Some songs that I really disliked were Yes and Speechless those song for me were a total borefest for me I actually fell asleep on those songs.The album also includes a remake of The Closer I get to you with a duet with Luther Vandross Another one of my favorite songs off the album I really wish this song was released as single and it still might have a chance even though Luther is recovering from his Stroke.The album is decent and I don't think it deserved so many grammys But its still worth listening if you're a Fan of Beyonce
B0001US8EO|3.0|I was hoping that this would be the expanded cut that was created for the deluxe laserdisc box set.  Good thing I looked at the case closely. Unfortunately, the DVD is the shorter theatrical edition. The laserdisc featuring the expanded edition is still the best way to see this film.
B0000YWKH2|5.0|Dont listen to people who gave it less than 4 stars. Honestly. Their expectations must have been sky-high or totally off-the-mark. I never watch television or go to the movies, so i never really saw a trailer for this film. I did not even know what it was about. I just went into the film with no expectations and no idea about what i was about to watch.<br />And you know what? It was pretty darn good. The acting in this movie is amazing...you never feel like youre watching something scripted. Everything comes off as being very, very natural. Coppola does a superb job of conveying emotion through scenery. You find yourself being a content observer...happy to stroll through the streets and buildings of Tokyo and VERY HAPPY to watch the karaoke sequence (youll know what im talking about).<br />As for the plot, story, etc...you'll often think \\"huh, nothing is going on\\"...but that is the beauty of this film. Nothing seems to happen and everything seems to happen. You walk away from this film feeling full, even though you never felt like you had been sitting through a movie.<br />I rented it...but now im going to buy it. Definitely one of the better movies ive seen in a long, long time.
0553212540|5.0|Oscar Wilde's 'The Picture of Dorian Gray' is an exceptional novel. Through this novel Mr. Wilde presents many characteristics of the human heart and mind. It hits hard telling the truth of the way in which people really are. Mr. Wilde in his novel asks the question how far would one go to obtain beauty and youth forever to please society? And in doing so presents the desires of most humans to remain young forever and the lengths in which they might go to obtain it. This novel illustrates the obession society has with the outward appearance rather than the inward and is shown in the novel by the Dorian Gray being accepted into the 'circle' despite the 'rumors' that he is a bad man. Through Dorian Gray and Lord Henry Mr. Wilde also illustrates the influence of people over people. Resulting in the destruction of character.<br />I enjoyed the book Dorian Gray because of the fact that it does tell the truth and quite often people don't like to hear the truth, but Oscar Wilde went against what society would view as good and did and wrote what he believed, which makes an wonderful novel.
B00009RDGA|5.0|Paper Moon is without a doubt Ryan O'Neal's best performance.  His daughter Tatum absolutely STEALS the show.  The Academy Award says it all.  Back then the Oscar meant something, now the whole thing's become a joke.  But Paper Moon will always be one of my favorites.  You really get the feel of the Depression era Midwest.  All the sets, costumes, and music authenticate this.  I've never gotten that &quot;Grapes of Wrath&quot; feel from any other movie that's been produced since the forties, and that's not just because it's shot in B&amp;W.  This movie also will keep you in stitches as Moses (O'Neal) slowly discovers how clever a little con artist Addie (Tatum) really is.  Her wit and sarcasm would make this movie equally entertaining if you turned off the picture and merely LISTENED to it.  It's that good.  I also adore Madeline Khan and Trixie Delight IS a delight.  This movie is in my top twenty and I recommend it as a &quot;must own.&quot;
B00006CXXU|4.0|I bought this album with the hopes that I would like at least 2-3 of the songs on it.  Most of the time the songs you hear on the radio are the only good ones on the CD's.  However, with the exception of &quot;Cruz&quot;,  all of these songs moved me in one way or another.  She can rock, sing the blues, pass on a little Latin flavor, as well as some gospel greatness.  I've always known that this girl could sing, but she has definitely blossomed with great maturity on this one.  And when she does her own harmonies...WOW!  Breaking away from the &quot;norm&quot; has been a good thing for her.  She now has the edge over any other pop star around. Keep up the good work X-Tina!!
B000002UAX|3.0|This one only gets three stars from me.  Sure, there are a lot of great moments on this album, but over half of it I can take or leave.  I just don't see what the big deal is about the &quot;White Album.&quot;  I like the Stones better than the Beatles anyway, but &quot;Revolver&quot; is a five star album.  That is The Beatles best album and all the rest of their stuff is pale in comparison.  If you have never bought a Beatles cd and are looking for a good first choice, get &quot;Revolver.&quot;  EVERY SINGLE SONG on &quot;Revolver&quot; is great!
0440237688|4.0|We read this book in our English lessons. At first it was difficult to understand but after a while we couldn't stop reading. We were fascinated how our future might be. It was difficult to imagine living without feelings and being totally equal. The book gave us an impulse to think about our life and we realized how great ordinary things like snow, sunshine, colours and feelings, of course, are.
B000002MZ6|4.0|This is one of three Oldfield cds that get five stars from me, the other two being Tubular bells II and Amarok.  All three are brilliant, and what's most fascinating about Mike Oldfield is not only has he written and orchestarted the music, but he is capable of playing all of the instruments, too.  And he plays them well.  He has truly blessed his fans.  The first time I listened to &quot;Songs of Distant Earth&quot; I closed my eyes and imagined I was traveling all over the planet, I was there grooving with the natives.  When I finished, I felt that I had truly had a spiritual experience.  It's almost like Mike does the drugs for you, you don't need to smoke anything, or take any funny pills, you WILL have an experience unlike any other with &quot;Songs of Distant Earth.&quot;  This one is my personal favorite from Oldfield and I highly recommend it.
B0001US62I|4.0|Despite the fact that this movie virtually tiptoed in and out of the box office limelight when it was released, it is still a very watchable, and often scary detective style thriller. What seems a simple missing person case brings Mickey Rourke to steamy (and often seamy) New Orleans and Harlem in the fifties. Working for a curiously menacing but well spoken client called Loius Cyphre, played superbly by Robert De Niro, our gumshoe must dig and delve into the past and try and retrace the steps of the disappearance. Cleverly twisted, and at times a little hard to follow, it transpires that the aforementioned Mr Cyphre (Lucifer in case you missed it) is actually on a harvest of souls that have been previously owed. The closer O' Rourke gets to the truth, the more horrifying it becomes, for him and everyone around him, in a very suspenseful, and often quite disturbing way. A young Lisa Bonet appeared in a fairly graphic, explicit and questionable sex scene in the original movie, which brought much controversy upon it, but has been restored in the unrated version. Despite the unlikely 80's designer stubble sported throughout by our hero, being fashionable in even the shadiest areas of town in the 50's, O'Rourke plays his part extremely well, often bemused, and superbly portarying genuine fear at the revelations he uncovers. Sure to thrill any audience today who likes the supernatural/thriller/mystery drama, it's still highly watchable. Perhaps enjoy is the wrong word here, but worth a visit!
B00005JMJ4|5.0|With Lost In Translation, Sofia Coppola has definitively proven that her film Virgin Suicides was no fluke. She is a profoundly gifted film maker. Both films move at a different pace from much of what passes for cinema these days. Nothing explodes; the lead actors don't hop into bed;  and there are no hyper dramatic scenes. Instead, each film unfolds at its own pace.<br />Yet there is nothing boring or stagnant in Lost In Translation. There is an easy naturalism to the plot line and the performances.  Of course, achieving this almost serene passage through the story is kind of like a perfect swing of a bat. What appears as effortless is the end result of focus, inspiration and lots of hard work.<br />As I get older ( I'm pushing 50 ). I find that I am constantly amazed by the great poise and skill that so many young actors bring to their work. Scarlett Johanssen is one of these people. My, God, she's a baby! Where does this depth and richness of portrayal come from? When I was her age the two big issues in my life were praying not to end up in Vietnam and seeing to it that my parents didn't know about my partying. When Johanssen is on screen she is mesmerizing, even when she is doing nothing. <br />But what makes this film a cause for celebration to my mind is Bill Murray. I'd pay money to watch him mow his lawn. He has a comic ( or maybe bemused is a better term ) approach to the world that can't be taught in drama school. He is a wonderfully unique actor whose particular skills where used to perfection in this film. His understated but hilarious reactions to Japanese culture are a treat to behold. Murray, like Johannsen, seemingly doesn't have to break a sweat in order to delivery fantastic performances. This film might have been much less successfully absent it's magnificent casting and Coppola's subtle mastery.<br />The plot is almost secondary to the story, because it is the intricate , unique and beautiful relationship that develops between Murray and Johanssen that drives this tale. This is a very special film. It is masterfully framed and filmed. The subtle color palette employed by the cinematography is visually lovely and  lyrically incorporates itself into the specific feel of the story as well as its.physical environment. Coppola has truly distinguished herself and has left me very much looking forward to her next project.
B0001GF2DS|4.0|If you haven't seen this movie, it represents one (if not THE) best of Sergio Leones &quot;Spaghetti&quot; westerns. At a hair under 3 hours, this is also up there with the likes of Once Upon a Time in the West (also by Leone) but moves with considerably more flow, and I think is a better script, story and movie overall. Clint plays the &quot;Man with no name&quot; a drifting, quick drawing hombre with a mean streak a mile wide, and tenacity to match and is the &quot;Good&quot; as referred to in the title. The story centers around gold buried in a cemetary, and is something of a multi subplotted journey to find it. Supported ably by Lee Van Cleef, and excellently by Eli Wallach as the unkempt and greedy &quot;Ugly&quot; part of the trio, this is a classic western in all senses. Sweeping vista's, bar room brawls, gunfights, hangings, and even a brief stop off in a War on the way. But the movie never plods, and any stale moments are usually livened up with some of Eli Wallachs comic relief (albeit playing straight). With a host of goodies on this collectable release including 4 documentaries, trailers, music and the newly renovated extended version in anamorphic widescreen, this is certainly worth owning. The transfer isn't bad, but please remember these movies were made nearly 30 years ago, and then on something of a budget. Often filmed in Europe, and South America, and sometimes dubbed over with local foreign extra's they have stood the test of time well, and look pretty fine on DVD - but there not perfect by a long way, Most will probably be forgiving however on content alone. 4 stars, but not quite 5 - Enjoy
B0001HAISG|5.0|In November 2003, I was stoked to learn that Peter Pan would be re-told in the way that author J.M. Barrie intended. The good, the bad, and the ugly. Peter Pan is not just some cutesy tale. There is meaning and feeling, which makes this fantasy the best of all fantasies. I saw the film three times in the theater, and I don't regret one penny I spent seeing it.<br />While it's fantastic on the big screen, it's still fantastic on the small screen in your living room. Most people know the story-- Peter Pan is a boy who refuses to grow up. He meets Wendy, Michael, and John Darling, whisks them away to the magical Neverland and have rip-roaring adventures together. Never did I think a film could capture the book so well. This movie does exactly that, and nothing could be better.<br />It's colorful, it beautiful, and the flying looks real. They're not on strings, Peter Pan is not played by a girl (Thank God!), and Tinkerbell is not just a flashlight on a wall. Peter is played by the marvelous Jeremy Sumpter, who is also in the film &quot;Frailty.&quot; He proves himself in both movies. He's the most amazing Pan you'll ever have the pleasure to see. Newcomer Rachel Hurd-Wood plays Wendy. She brings new life to the character of Wendy. And then there is Jason Isaacs. He plays both Captain Hook and Mr. Darling, creating a Hook that is more memorable than ever before.<br />The DVD features are alright, I bought the movie just for the movie, not the features. The features give insight on the making of the film, which is interesting, but some of them are so short (less than two minutes on one!) that I wonder why they were even included on the DVD. <br />Definitely get this movie. It's perfectly for all ages, all types. It doesn't matter who you are-- the theme and meaning of Peter Pan is something that we can all relate to. The visuals are great, fantastic acting, awesome musical score (in which case, you might want to check out the soundtrack sometime!)-- overall just a wonderful film that you'll watch again and again.

0060012331|2.0|Maurice is a very clever talking cat. He travels from town to town in Discworld with a band of taking rats and a boy (who probably talks the least). Together, they run a \\"Pied Piper\\" scam. Now they've just arrived in Bad Blinitz, but what they don't now is this town is different from the others they've swindled. They join up with the Mayor's daughter (probably the best character) to try and solve the strange going ons the town is experiencing. Got quite confusing in a couple of bits, which is one of the reasons I gave it a lower rating. Also, I felt like Pratchett's usual originality was sort of stifled in it.
B000060P79|1.0|There are no words I can think of right now to explain how bad this crap is. It belongs in a garbage disposal. They deserve to be shot in the head. I wouldn't take this CD home with me even if you paid me $20. Hell, it's so bad that I would rather listen to the f*ckin Backstreet Boys!!!<br />Ok, enough ranting...I just wanted to give ANOTHER 1 star review towards the worst music ever to grace this planet.
B000002N9L|4.0|This CD caught me off guard. I am a long time Prince fan and I have most of his albums. This CD is one of the top 5 ever released by Prince. It has nice guitar work on just about every song. If you like Dirty Mind, Purple Rain, or Controversy I highly recomend this album. I can't believe that it was thought to be a throw away CD. If you like to here Prince rock then this is the CD to buy.
B00000IXWN|4.0|First off I'd like to say that this recording is well worth buying, the sound quality is great, and Leslie Howard provides great interpretations. The only downfall on this CD (the reason I didnt give it 5 stars) is because it contains some of Liszts music that has never been recorded before, which is great, but some of the pieces are rather boring, but that is just a small fraction of the CD. Again, I would reccomend buying this CD.
6305428387|5.0|&quot;Cool Runnings&quot; is one of the best movies I have seen.<BR>The story line, John Candy and the Jamaican Bobsledders,<BR>the switch from warm Jamaica to cold Calgary all make for a<BR>warm and funny movie.

B0001LJC2K|5.0|I first started listening to MUSE in 1999 when a friend in Prague introduced me to their music. As impressed as I was then by a few of their songs, this album, Absolution, has impressed me with just about every song. <br />The songs on Absolution are melodic, intricate, and polished. The timing on the songs, every note... perfect. Additionally, the inclusion of classical-style piano solos gives their songs a wonderfully grandose feeling. Singer Matt Bellamy's daring vocals often remind me of a combination of Jeff Buckley and Thom Yorke (Radiohead). Vocally, the similarities are undeniable. Lyrically, not as much. As much as I love Apocalypse Please, Time Is Running Out, &amp; Sing for Absolution, BUTTERFLIES and HURRICANES is the most engaging song on the album. Turn it up and let its magnificence envelope you. <BR>ABSOLUTION is without a doubt their best album thus far and will stand in the minds of many fans as their defining album.

B00005QGAT|5.0|This is a great album. You'll love every song on this album! It is truly one of the best albums ever! Michael sounds as good as he ever has. His singing and dancing is fabulous! His songwriting ablities are amazing. He wrote Don't Stop Till You Get Enough, Workin Day and Night, and Get on the Floor. These songs are all classics! Now, Michael first off, did an amazing job with this album. But, don't forget that Rod Temperton wrote Rock with You, Off the Wall, and Burn this Disco Out. Which are also great MJ songs. Temperton also wrote Baby Be Mine, Thriller, and Lady in My Life for the album Thriller. So, Off the Wall and Thriller, MJ wrote Seven of the 19 songs (Billie Jean, Beat It, Wanna Be Startin Somethin, Girl is Mine, Get on the Floor, Don't Stop till You Get Enough, and Workin Day and Night which are all genious songs) Temperton wrote: Thriller, Baby Be Mine, Rock with You, Lady in my Life, Off the Wall, and Burn this Disco Out. I'm not trying to take away from MJ's genius work, which truly is genius, but to say that you should give Rod Temperton some love. So, if you reall love Off the Wall, then I suggest that you also check into the band Heatwave which Rod Temperton played for and wrote nearly all of the songs for. So, if you dig MJ you'll also dig Heatwave just like I did.
B00005JLT5|5.0|The movie is based on Wladyslaw Szpilman's real life experience in the midst of torment of World War II.<br />The movie shows The Pianist(Adrien Brody),a jew forced to live in the Warsaw Ghetto after escaping the deportation. The suffering and loneliness of an emotionally devastated, strong minded,but weak otherwise personage. In the midst of this, his fingers always keep on moving on a virtual piano, the only support in his (not-so)surving days until a German officer(Thomas Kretschmann) comes to his rescue.<BR>The director(Roman Polanski) has excelled in remaining as close as possible to reality without being too loud abt it.<br />This is one of those movies which makes one speechless after watching it. Definitely a movie which cannot be easily forgotten!!
B00005JLRT|2.0|The story and all was horrible. The entire movie just reaked, thanks to the dismembering of the basic ideals of the series by Berman. The ONLY thing I found extremely great about this film was the redesign of the Romulan Warbird.<br />On the merits of the visual effects this movie does stand out. A lot of decent cgi work was done here, and the guys on that crew deserve credit. Though they alone could not save this movie.<br />I think the major problem was the story line and all that. This plot was so horribly flimsy that it could break like celophane on a window. There just wasn't anything remotely approaching interesting here. And adding a THIRD Song-type android was just... <br />THis movie was pretty terrible, and unfortunatly has killed off one of the best movie series ever. Berman has pretty much mutilated and slaughtered this series on all levels. Allas my old friend, I shall miss you.
B000148KK2|2.0|It's seems like her CD was majorly influenced by Elvis's style.  Not like the old Diana at all.  Very disappointed in this CD.
B00018TI5E|3.0|This track has two great songs, which are tracks #2 and #15. The rest of the able sounds like some sort of radiohead parody crossed with the RHCP. Which means I don't necessarily think this a &quot;classic&quot; frusciante album. If anything, &quot;shadows collide with people&quot; is John Frusciante's equivalent to Eric Clapton's &quot;Backless.&quot; In other words, average filler music after a classic solo comeback; frusciante with 2001's &quot;To Record Only Water For 10 Days&quot; and Clapton with &quot;Slowhand.&quot; Buy it if your a die-hard fan only.
B000127LW2|5.0|I did not get into Voyager until the 5th season thanks to my sister persistance I gave in. The series in general is great.

B000006TRV|5.0|I beieve in all fairness the editorial reviewer summarized it and explained it best.    If you want to understand the Pink Floyd you have to have a broad knowledge of history, geography, listened to all their albums, in short have some basic IQ, a little above a CHIMPS !!!  Just saying this album sucks, will just make your air head suck !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!  If you listen to Final Cut album for example you will understand why the Roger Waters is against the war and how his father was killed during the Second World War by a German Tiger Tank for no good reason to keep a bridge for a few minutes for alies that was going to fall anyway. ( Some idiots would think it is a Bengali tiger since the song doesn't mention it is a tank).  Don't laugh guys, if you watch Jay Leno shows, you see people on Hollywood Blvd. who think Abraham Lincoln is the current Mayor of NYC !!!!!!<BR>If you are below triple digit , thats OK too, buy Metallica and turn the volume high; if you some moneies left get a few steel rings put on your rings and decorate yourself.<BR>The album is great, songs are subtle, abstract but great.  This is a Strong BUY !! the LTD edition is great too; I would also own the &quot;Final Cut&quot;; I think two of them make better sense !!!
B00006RIO7|5.0|I love musicals and this movie was great.  even though the actors aren't by profession singers, catherine zeta-jones and queen latifah do a fabulous job.  renee zellweger has a great voice for the part she plays as does richard gere.  what disappointed me about the soundtrack is that it doesn't contain the all instrumental &quot;Chicago After Midnight&quot;.  i've been looking everywhere for a recording but haven't had any luck so far.  if anyone can help me out, leave a message!
B00008CLOA|5.0|We use to say the same thing about the Beatles in high school.  This is one group that will be remembered till the end of time and so will this album !!!!  If you call yourself a music junkie;albums like Abbey Road.,  Sgt. Pepper, Forty Licks, Weathered, Beethoven's Fifth,  The Marriage of Figaro, You have to have The Dark Side of the Moon and get to know Pink Floyd.<BR>I dont know why Roger Waters ever broke away from the group but it was very unfortunate.  Buy ALL their Albums not just one.  Well worth Each penny !!!  Music is good for the soul and there are a lot of worst places you can spend your money !!!!!!!!!!
B0001I55OC|4.0|Timeline is one of my favorite movies.  It starts off with a group of archaeologists digging in old Castleguard, France.  A archaeologist ,Kate, was digging in a tunnel and found the professors name on an old piece of parchment paper dated back to 1347.  The professor had been accidentaly sent back in time to Castleguard, France in 1347.  Together as a group the archaeologists (including professors son, Chris, played by Paul Walker) went back in time to save the professor, France, and their future.  Along the way they become better friends, make friends, and lose friends.  Timeline is an adventurous tale based on the book by Michael Crichton (you can buy it on Amazon) which draws you back to the medieval times.  Timeline has great special effects, and shows you how different the culture today is from the culture during that time.  There is brief language and lots of violence (throats cut, stabbing, hit by arrows, etc.)(...)
0316779237|5.0|In a word: hilarious.  This book is not long, but what it lacks in size, it makes up for in laughs.  I took this slim volume on a flight to visit the family during the past holiday season, and it was just the thing to put me in the spirit.  One story is formatted as a newsletter to the writer's family, and I thought I was really going to disturb all the passengers seated around me with my hysterical laughter that I tried so hard to subdue.  I must say that you should avoid this book like the mistletoe at an office Christmas party if you don't go for dark humor.  These short stories are not warm, fuzzy Tiny Tim scenes, but they do make you draw parallels with people you may know and (...*gasp!*...) even people in your own family.  The price is right, and the time is now to buy this wonderfully funny book!  I also recommend the other books by David Sedaris!  You'll laugh until you cry.
B00009W0U4|3.0|i must admit to disliking this film intensely upon my first exposure to it.  i still feel that it reeks of pretention, is unintentually erotic and that its creator grossly misjudges the impact images in film have on the human mind.  but i now realize that this exercise in artristic experimentation is as effective as it intends to be despite some minor flaws and the directors irresponsability.  it effected me.  and because of this i cannot condemn it.
B000009RQD|5.0|I find this to be the one of the 4 solo albums, where someone had the balls to do something a little different than the normal.  Yes, it does not sound that much like a KISS album, however Gene was ready to be different than what people expected and this is why I think it is the best of the 4.  That is my opinion and I am sticking to it.
0553275976|5.0|Has anyone else noticed that in just about any movie made in the last 10 years, whenever there is a bookshelf in the background a paperback copy of BOTV is on the shelf?  Why is this?  Are there that many copies in used book stores that prop masters have no choice but to select it, or was some contract signed that would ensure that it got more movie shelf time than any other book?  Granted it's a wonderful book, but that doesn't fully explain the phenomenon.  Just something to think about.
B000089RVX|1.0|I belhave this is won of the most of the worst CD's I haver purchassed... it's not that soundful... the tracks are just agnorint... anhd I feel like the singar chiack must get surgery for her voice... I wouldnt like this band if they were better... becaz its implossiblte to inprovise a bend this bad... I am sarious... Evenecents is just terrible I bought this cd along iwth a a simpler... which cost 5$ alone and I really felt ashamed for the emont of casch I wasted... I felt so sorry... this Cd wasn't made for purchase... this bends &quot;Maken of the Bend&quot; should be on Jackass: the movie! I really dont want to recoomend this too you but if you bye it, I feel for you.<br />I thought that Linkin Park's singer sounds alot like the singer of Evanescentes... but I was wrong... Linkin park isnt good either.<br />I bye aloth of my CD here on Amazon and I was dissappointed with this bad thing... It wasj ust like junk in the rainbow... colorful yet crappy... so disress...

B0000AR8NK|5.0|How good is it to have David back in top teasing, mischievous, but also dead serious form?  Never Get Old indeed -- only he could stake such a claim and make it stick, but pictures don't lie. Medically assisted or buying into the Dorian Gray-thing, he looks and sounds fabulous.  The opening guitar chords to Never Get Old, in fact, reach straight back to the start of Let's Dance.  But of course, it is 20 years on from that song and album and even David does age after all. And as for the world, well, just look at that &quot;great white scar over Battery Park.&quot; So, instead of simply &quot;let's dance...,&quot; it is now -- in New Killer Star, one of the four best songs on the CD -- &quot;let's face the music and dance.&quot; <br />You can also look at Reality as David's post-terrorism gift to and celebration of New York.  Battery Park, Jonathan Richmond's Pablo Picasso &quot;never getting called an [...]...not in New York,&quot; she driving the big car &quot;up in Riverside...south along the Hudson,&quot; with the radio louder and louder, looking for water after losing &quot;God in a New York minute.&quot; <br />Favorite cuts are the rockers -- the mentioned New Killer Star, Never Get Old, She'll Drive the Big Car, and, especially now after numerous listens, Fall Dog Bombs the Moon.  Bowie is also a two-time romantic here with The Luckiest Guy and Days.  Losers are the ill-advised Try Some, Buy Some -- bad for George Harrison, worse for Bowie -- and the endless Bring Me the Disco King.  I would have done so in thirty seconds if it would have stopped the song.  Still, the rest of this is so good that those two dregs do not dip my rating below a full five stars.
B0001W8Q9Y|5.0|I own the limited edition (double)cd. This is a great album, with great songs. I played it at work and most of the people loved it!, they couldnt believe that they were listening to Marillion!. <BR>Buy this album, you wont regret it.

B0001ZMWQO|4.0|OK, first off .... I cannot even put this band (CD)into any kind of catergory.  All I know is that it rips and rocks all the way through.  Yeah, a song or two might start off a little on the mellow side .... But, just wait.  Yes, it will make you want to dance around the house playing any particular instrument with glee!<BR>My husband introduced me to this band.  He is more into the classic rock sound ~ &quot;Jets&quot; and what not.  I am more into the Retro sound of &quot;The Strokes.&quot;  We met in the middle and equally love this sound!
B000089RVX|5.0|Several months before &quot;Daredevil&quot; and the explosion of this group, I was working at Hot Topic and we got a couple of the &quot;Fallen&quot; cds in.  Once I heard the first notes of &quot;Going Under&quot;, I bought it and have played it every day, give or take.<br />My favorite song is &quot;Touniquet&quot;.  The lyrics and the music blend and make for a moment.  I want &quot;My Immortal&quot; played at my funeral, the sentiments fit how I'd like to be remembered by my lifepartner (although he'd take the &quot;Tourniquet&quot; route and off himself).<br />It's going to be hard for Amy and the boys to follow this cd up.  I have hopes that they are here to stay...

0142000663|3.0|&quot;The Grapes of Wrath&quot; is a powerful indictment of the oppression endured by the migrant families of the American mid-west during the depression years of the 1930's. The mid-west had suffered severe drought. &quot;Dusters&quot; swept across the farmland, skimming off the topsoil, leaving behind a dustbowl, only a few sprigs of wheat surviving. The tenant farms were foreclosed and the families tractored off the land in a ruthless drive to maximise profit. Circe 250,000 migrants, &quot;refugees from the dust&quot;, pulled up stakes and headed west on route 66, the road of flight to California, golden land of dreams and opportunity, drawn by the picking work, harvesting oranges and peaches. The flowing in of rootless migrant workers centred on the San Joachin valley, California, and the huge farms there. The overwhelming glut of migrants flooding through the valley swamped the harvesting work available, driving down wages to peanuts level as they desperately scrabbled &quot;to pull, to pick, to cut - anything, any burden to bear, for food&quot;.<br />  This is the destiny that fate held in store for the Joad family in &quot;The Grapes of Wrath&quot;. Forced off their farm, truck piled high with their belongings, the Joads set forth on a journey 2000 miles haul from Sallislaw in Oklahoma through the western desert states of Arizona and New Mexico and onto the San Joachin valley. The gut-wrenching story of the Joads heroic journey is interspersed with short &quot;relief&quot; chapters on  aspects of their route 66 experience, the tricks of used-car salesmen or a snapshot of life in a truck-stop diner, to cite only a couple examples; other chapters function as social on, for example, the stomach turning practice of spraying mountains of oranges with kerosene or dumping potatoes in the river under armed guard to protect market prices, at a time when hundreds of thousands of migrants were literally starving. This structure enables Steinbeck at once to follow closely the fortunes of the Joads and cast a wider eye over what is happening in society during the depression years.<br />  However, Steinbeck's narrative, in my view, is at its most powerful and compelling on the road,the Joads suffering and misfortune trucking along the endless narrow concrete miles to Bakersfield, California, revealing qualities of guts and resilience in their desperate struggle for survival in the face of death, starvation, hostility, exploitation and harassment. Steinbeck's powerful voice shows the migrants during the hard times of the 1930's depression years, the hardship and oppression endured by thousands upon thousands of families like the Joads, will resonate for generations to come. It is a voice that packs alot to say!ely the fortunes of the Joads and cast a wider eye over what is happening in society during the depression years.<br />    However, Steinbeck's narrative, in my view, is at its most powerful and compelling on the road,the Joads suffering and misfortune trucking along the endless narrow concrete miles to Bakersfield, California, revealing qualities of guts and resilience in their desperate struggle for survival in the face of death, starvation, hostility, exploitation and harassment.

B0001907DA|5.0|What a terrific low price for 6 great films! Plus one thrown in for free.<br /><br />The Police Academy box set contains all 7 movies on 7 discs. But I don't like the packaging they come in. They are 7 individual CARDBOARD case's. I hate those cardboard ones with plastic glued to them, they are too easy to damage, look bad next the regular cases on your shelf, but at least they all come in one box. The cheapo's making these thing's should be shot, but least you get a box to hide them all in I suppose. For me personally, I think the box set should have came with, maybe just 3 discs? All the bonus material of the commentary and stuff on one disc with the original and best Police Academy 1. Put all the featurettes and making of's and deleted scenes on that first disc. Parts 2 + 3 + 4 on disc 2, and parts 5 + 6 + 7 on the 3rd disc! They would all fit. We do have the technology to build this.. but no, they are separated. Oh well. Making it look bigger I guess is more important than quality and convenience.<br /><br />POLICE ACADEMY - The original and the best. The movie you either love or hate, the movie that started it all off. Introducing us to beloved characters such as the smart @, mischief making degenerate Mahoney , Motor Mouth Jones, Fun Bags Callihan, Captain Harris, Moses Hightower, the bumbling accident prone Spakler, the nutcase and a half Takleberry, Commandant Eric Lassard and many, many more. the plot is about the new recruits of an Academy. They are brought in this time when the police academy is taking any old bum this year, which sets audiences up to go into one comedic ride of fun. If you don't laugh at the movie's jokes, then you just cannot have a sense of humor then?! And to those of you who said that the movie is so far fetched ,and isn't realistic enough like real life cops? Ummmm... its a comedy... thats like saying the Wizard of Oz was a bad movie because there is no such place over the rainbow and it dosent really exist... real trees and scarecrow's and tin men and lions don't talk, let alone can function without parts of the human anatomy! It's a comedy...and its probably based more on reality then you'd think!<br /><br />PART 2 - Their first Assignment kicks of when Lassard's brother who is a chief of a prescient that's going down the drain and the streets are being run wild with crime and gangs. So when his brother asks Lassard for assistance, he sends just the right men for the job! Also introducing the funny and hilarious animal of a man Mr Zed (Bob Cat Goldwaith) who is just over the top crazy and funny. Also Lassards brother is... eh, that guy from \\"Head of the class\\" before Billy Connely took over. Also introduces the man to hate, Captain Mauser and his more popular side-kick, the goofy guy Proctor. A man who isn't playing with a full deck!<br /><br />Part 3 - Back In training: It's time for one of the states 2 academy's to be shut down. It's a decision for a comity to be made which is the better academy which will be the one that remains open. But with [now] Cmndt Mauser up to his unfair play, he's sabotaging Lassards academy to help his chances of winning.<br /><br />Part 4 - Citizens on Patrol: this is my favorite of them all, Lassard has put a community based program together to help get the community involved in helping stop crime. But as he vacations, the return of Captain Harris is a little jealous and against the program, and attempts to make it fail. But with new recruits and the old ones, the underdogs are to the rescue. Also it introduces David Spade and Sharon Stone. They only appeared in this film. But I beleive it was Spades first film?<br /><br />Part 5: Miami Beach: A favorite of mine, but not to others for some reason? I guess they just don't like the fact Steve Guttenberg didn't return to play Mahoney. Lassard has been honored as the police chief officer of the decade. And his award will be presented in Miami Beach Florida. And of coarse, he brings his friends and finest officersto join him. But soon trouble lurks as a gang of thieves get mixed up with a diamond problem, and Lassard gets kidnapped, so the boys n girls in blue are out to the rescue!<br /><br />Part 6: Also one that got put down, and you can see why. A crime syndicate has erupted in the area by a master mind. And it's up to the Police Academy to join Captin Harris's precinct to figure out, and stop the crime wave. Also shows the return of monster truck Big Foot, who was also in part 2, for some useless information for you. Not the best of the PA series, not the worst, but did start to venture into that over the top goofy style of events.<br /><br />Part 7: Mission to Moscow - Minimal laughs to me. Even with a bit more of a budget and filming one of the first American comedy's in Russia, I didn't feel like the movie had the same spirit as the other 6. The new lead guy, whatever his name is? (in 18 again/Diagnoses murder) didn't really seem like the type of new leader role. Also missing from the group is High Tower (Bubba Smith) and Proctor. A few laughs here and there, and even tho P.A movies have always been kind of goofy, I felt the 7th one was just too cartoon wacky to be liked. If I was buying the Movies individually, I would have skipped buying 7. But seeing as how its such a great price for all 7, I'll consider the 7th to be a thrown in for free movie with the other 6 as a coffee coaster. Even Ron Pearlman as the bad dude could not save this giant flop.<br /><br />The bonus features are decent. on the first disc you get commentary by a few of the characters and producer etc... and around about a 30 minute interview with cast and crew in a kind of re-union. And its sad to find out that Tackleberry has passed away in recent years. It would be nice to know what he thought about playing his manically ,gun crazy and loony role?<br /><br />All discs come with a short interview, and some with a little bit of on location, or on location interview footage. Not much to please tho.The only one that was really nice to see was part 4 Citizens on Patrol has \\"Deleted Scenes\\"!!!! It was great to see some unseen footage from the movies! In the cometary they talk about cut scenes, and it would have been great to see them on the first one; but I guess the footage doesn't exist anymore? too bad.<br /><br />Overall: Excellent price for all 6 movies, plus you get part 7 thrown in for free (probably the only way to get any one to buy it?) Even tho 4 and 5 arnt in widescreen. It doesn't bother me, There great movies. And definitely without a doubt, one of the very few movies that has had successful sequels!

B0001MDP3G|4.0|The movie was realley good, as was the book. I don't waunt to debare every tiny difference between the two. I simply would like to set the record straight on the whole Ada Inman instant romance. A few flertatious moments with Ada are not the reasons that Inman travels so far to get back to Cold Mountain. Ada is a medaphor for home. She represents the mountains, farms ,and comunity that Inman is trying to get to. So stop scoffing at the suddenness of the romance and focus on the love this weary soldier has for the home he has been fighting for, for the last four years. That is why the ending is not sad. He did it, he made it home to see the fields and mountains one last time instead of dieing on some battlefield far away.

B000002GZ1|5.0|In the early Sixties, the prevailing wisdom was that the blues was a music based on the shared experience of African Americans and that any attempt by a \\"Caucasian\\" to play the blues would..er, uh...pale in comparison to the authentic renditions of the blues by African Americans. In 1965, Paul Butterfield broke that color barrier, not by successfuly \\"imitating\\" black blues musicians, but by developing his own signature playing and singing style that demanded that audiences and critics accept Butterfield on his own terms. Butterfield's passion and intensity transcended any formulamatic notions of authenticity simply because of Butterfield's refusal to be evaluated as an imitator. His playing and singing were so uniquely stylized and original that when Butterfield played \\"Look Over Yonder's Wall\\" nobody used the Elmore James original as a litmus test of authenticity. I've heard enough bad imatators of B.B.King, both black and white, to know that racial authenticy is not a very reliable benchmark to evaluate good blues. Mediocrity is color blind, as is brilliance and any argument to the contrary is simply, as they say, academic.<br /><br />Butterfield's band was bi-racial with rythym section consisting of Howlin' Wolf Band veterans Jerome Arnold on bass and the mighty Sam Lay on drums. Elvin Bishop, a University of Chicago student from Oklahoma learned guitar under the tutelage of another Howlin' Wolf veteran, Smokey Smothers. From 1963 until 1965 Bishop and Butterfield played together at Little John's a smokey blues joint on Chicago's northside. Near the time of this recording, Mark Naftalin was added to the band. Naftalin, a former University of Chicago student, played understated but tasty solos on Hammond organ. Naftalin was a nuanced jazz player having received a year of formal training at Mannes College of Music, where he was recruited by Butterfield for the band.<br /><br />Many of the tracks from this album were originally recorded without Michael Bloomfield's guitar, but Butterfield reluctantly added Bloomfield, an out of work session player under contract to Columbia Records, at the urging of Paul Rothschild, the brilliant producer at the budding Elektra record label. Bloomfield was a young guitar savant whose signture guitar style contained elements of Albert King's tension, release and sustained feedback; Wes Montgomery's cascading flurries of jazz notes; Elmore James' electrifying bottle neck; and even unconvential modalities like atonal Indian ragas and swaying samba rythyms. The diffence of the in the master tapes with and without Bloomfield is startling. The addition of Bloomfield's explosive guitar playing appears to have ignited the entire band<br /><br />On the opening cut, \\"Born In Chicago\\" Butterfield wastes no time in dispelling the white blues efficacy argument with his take no prisoners approach to blues shouting. The hard edged lyrics to Nick Gravenites's song,\\"...I was born in Chicago in 1941, and my father told me, son you had better get a gun\\", seemed to be issuing a challenge to the Doubting Thomases with staid intellectual theories of black authenticity.  Butterfield's haromica playing is so uniquely sculpted that comparisons to either Little Walter or Sonny Boy Williamson are futile. The approach of the Butterfield Blues Band raises the ante to new sonic levels. The decibel level is so high and the playing is so intense that it appears that the band can generate enough electricity to light up the Chicago skyline. Butterfield and his guitarist Bloomfield appear to be circling each other like caged lions in the crossfire between the harmonica and guitar solos. Elvin Bishop's rippling and bracing guitar solos are almost an afterthought because Butterfield and Bloomfield remained locked in a tense struggle for sonic domination of the band that rages like a prarie fire until the last note of the final song, \\"Look Over Yonder's Wall.\\"<br /><br />Such was the legendary mutual ambivalence between Paul Butterfield and Michael Bloomfield...the twin towers of the Butterfield Blues Band. Both men were so endowed with rare musical talent that only an act of serendipity placed them on the same stage together. They were linked forever by this hellaciously good band, but each seemed to be saying to the other the equivalent of, \\"This band ain't big enough for the both of us.\\"  It was this brinksmanship between Butter and Bloom that often pushed the band into uncharted territory.<br /><br />I saw this edition of the Butterfield Band twice in concert and their approach to both jazz and blues was so intense that they appeared to be tearing a hole in the fabric of the cosmos itself, armed with the sword of Damocles. The brilliance of Paul Rothchild's production was that he captured this raw intensity and seamless playing skill on vinyl. One can take a snapshot of the eye of a hurricane, but few photos capture the fury of storm, itself. Rothchild seemed to have bottled a raging force of nature, using some  form of trickery at the studio mixing console. Bloomfield was partially responsible because he was the rare musician could play on a both a concert stage, or the clinical setting of a studio booth with the same pulse stopping immediacy.<br /><br />For better or for worse, Butterfield's first album was an early statement of a generation of musicians who were unwilling to accept the arbitrary limits of conventional wisdom. It was 1965; and the musical revolution that about to change everyone's lives so dramatically was just budding forth.  As the Sixties unfolded a hundreds of self-styled musicians bloomed into musical maturity and like Butterfield and Bloomfield, they challenged conventional wisdom and often their creativity crossed the divide between the sacred and the profane, but we are all better people for it.rfield and Michael Bloomfield...the twin towers of the Butterfield Blues Band.

B00005A46T|5.0|I have to say that this album is a step forward from their last album. In &quot;Iowa&quot;, there seems to be more usage of the members of Slipknot, i think. The thing i really noticed that contributes to this statement is the use of the keyboardist. Of course Slipknot's soul purpose and striving is based on being &quot;scary&quot; and &quot;thrashy&quot;. One thing you notice when listening to 'People=Sh**' and 'Disasterpiece', (and im just thinking of those now cuz i just heard them) is that the keyboarding displays a great deal of contribution in the act of making it more &quot;scary&quot;. In fact i noticed that the keyboards from those songs--mostly on the chorus to 'Disasterpiece'-- sound much the same to that of oh lets say the Deftones' 'Hexagram'. In 'Hex..' the verses you can really hear the speciality of the keyboards if you pay more attention to the backgrounds. Obviously, people like to bash Slipknot because of the whole mask thing and the need to have 9 members also beg the question....is this for image or what??..well, i did indeed give Slipknot's &quot;Iowa&quot; a 5-5 star rating BECAUSE--<BR>Slipknot has great originality...think wat you want, but if there is EVER a band that sounds, looks, somehow even resembles Slipknot, i will be damned!  <BR>--the truth is, there are NOT a whole lot of Slipknot cover bands <BR>1.because not many even consider putting together 9 people in a band. <BR>2.without a significant amount of people, it wud not be possible to make Slipknot's exact sound. <br />3.NoBody will sound like Corey Taylor.<BR>---This album is obviously very important for the birth of the Slipknot motto that we all love and know of....&quot;People=Sh**&quot; and is a great song for live crap!<br />The downside to this album and of course the whole basis of &quot;Slipknot&quot; is the fact that 9 guys are not needed to make the music. Everybody knows that some guys on this band are not needed and practically do not do anything. For instance;<BR>-DJ? (ok maybe he is pretty cool in songs like &quot;Surfacing&quot;, &quot;Purity&quot;, &quot;Heretic Anthem&quot;......but common, we dont need another Limp Bizkit!??so drop the whole DJ thing.)<BR>-2 extra drummers?? (Joey Jordison is quite an amazing drummer, they truely dont need 2 more percussionists..)<BR>----so there, if you took out those metioned above you would have a 6!! piece band, 'nough said ---Vocal/Guitar/guitar/bass/drums/Keyboard -(its cool!) <br />Overall Slipknot have done a good job. The thing i like about them is that they are not whiney and those masks are so cool, they dont want to  be seen by the stupid teenyboppers and they dont want to be recognized either when they go out into the world!, good idea guys....
B00005JLYW|4.0|&quot;Charlie's Angels: Full Throttle&quot; is most simply a perfect popcorn movie. You pop this in the DVD player, turn the speakers up, sit down, turn your brain off, and watch the action sequences unfold, one after another. Cameron Diaz, Drew Barrymore, and Lucy Liu are back, sans Bill Murray's Bosley in the second installment for more insane action sequences, fight scenes, and gratuitous booty shots. The plot is really quite simple. The government hid the names of people in the Witness Protection Program on two rings, one containing the real names and the other containing the aliases. Someone has stolen them and its the Angel's job to get them both back. Seems simple enough. Its not.<br />From the first explosion to the last landed blow, this film is a mess, but it benefits from being so. If it were to take itself as a serious action movie, it would've been the first &quot;Mission: Impossible&quot; (which actually had the same plot) just with three really hot chicks. Since the producers of the movie decided to let everyone know the major surprise twist in the casting announcements and even the films trailer, finding out that Demi Moore was the villian didn't come as a shock but they did do a good job of hiding it from people who hadn't seen the trailer.<br />Bernie Mac does a pretty good job of replacing Bill Murray as Bosley, who wasn't such a big part of the first film anyway. John Cleese is good as Lucy Liu's father, seeming disappointed and shocked in his daughter's chosen line of work (after a bit of a mix-up due to Alex's ex-boyfriend, Matt LeBlanc). Justin Theroux, Shia LeBeouf, and Crispin Glover (reprising his Creepy Thin Man role) are all good, even though the latter never says a word except &quot;AAAHHHH!!!&quot;. <br />The one thing that really bothered me about this film was the last act, where Demi Moore jumps off a building and literally flies for 5 blocks with these attachments on her dress. It was aforementioned in the film that she had won a Nobel Prize for her research on flying mammals, so that figures that she would know how to do it, but come on. Even in action movies some things are a little over the top. The special effects are real bad there. Otherwise, they were okay. Nothing Oscar worthy in this film. <br />The score for this movie is exponentially better than that of the first film. There is an internal conflict within Drew Barrymore's character so there are some real somber musical moments. The show's theme is used a few times and of course, the &quot;plot thickens&quot; theme is used to great effect. Even the songs in the movie were good, like &quot;Breathe&quot; and &quot;Firestarter&quot;, during the Coal Bowl and sailor fight, respectively, by Prodigy.<br />Buy it if you want a good, funny action movie to spend a Friday night watching. Avoid it if you don't like over-the-top action. Lord knows theres plenty of it in this movie. He should after all...it is a movie about Angels.
B00006SFLV|5.0|I first heard of My So-Called Life when it began to air on the digital cable/satellite  night-time teen network The-N. I didn't think anything on The-N could compete with Degrassi, but when they say My So-Called Life defined teen drama, I soon found out they weren't kidding. I love this show! It really hits home, truly. I recognized Claire Danes as Kate Brewster in Terminator 3 and couldn't believe it when I made the connection. Wow! She's grown up! I was blown away when I saw the complete series on DVD in FYE, but was disappointed to see that it only lasted one season. It should have gone on longer.

Morrie gives hope to people who are diagnosed with a fatal illness.  This book teaches readers to understand that there may be regrets in life, but there is always forgiveness.  The book helps people understand the death process Morrie's story is an inspiration to all.
B000094HMU|5.0|I have seen other version of performances of this masterpiece opera by Puccini. I was not so impressed before and has been thinking that Puccini is not my appetite therefore not so enjoyable as other composers like Mozart or Verdi or Rossini. However, after having seen this version performed by the Met with such superb and wellknown singers, I realized that this music is as beautiful and enjoyable as other operas and shall be regarded as one of the masterpieces of operas. <BR>Placido Domingo as Calaf and Eva Marton as Turandot are such super stars in singing as well in acting to be able to present the music into a divine and enchanting entirety. Also other singers like Mitchel as Liu matched the beautiful singing of the two above. The costumes and background sets was arranged in such elegant and rich designs which is as perfect and harmoniously matching to the place and contents of the story itself which make the entire opera a complete magnificent performance. <BR>I enjoy the whole performance immensely and thereafter realize that opera performances not only depend on the music itself but mainly on the immensity and magnitude of the performance and singers.

B0000399WI|5.0|Very few movies capture the triumph of the human spirit as memorably as The Shawshank Redemption. That is definetely  a true statement!  To tell you the truth, The Shawshank Redemption really moved me.  It is a movie made to perfection (which more movies should be these days).  Since there are so many reviews on this site, I won't go into details about the story, but rather express my love for this wonderful movie.  Personally, I thing Morgan Freeman gives the best performance in this movie hands down!  Tim Robbins was great too, but something about Morgan's performance really makes you understand and feel for him deeply. Frank Darabont (in his directorial debut) did a stunning job directing this film. I guess that I could go on and on about this movie but is seems useless since there are so many reviews on this site.  But if anyone gets a chance to read this review (who hasn't seen the movie) please give it a chance! Hopefully you will feel the same way about it as I do. Simply a MASTERPIECE!
B000001FN1|5.0|This was one of the most well rounded, and most impressive releases of the 80's Heavy Metal era in my opinion. \\"Triumph And Agony\\" is also the best release Warlock has ever put their name on....    Lead vocalist, and founding member Doro Peche is not only a total fox, she's got one hell of a voice as well. A pure Metal voice that is infectious, and beautiful at the same time. You'll fall in love with her if you're not careful. In 1987, I know I was....    \\"Triumph And Agony\\" was a graet purchace in 1987, and even today this release has stood the test of time as one of the best in Heavy Metal. Warlock totally rips on this release, and the songs are all very powerful and heartfelt. They had a unique sound, one that has not been duplictaed since IMO. I love this release, and from start to finish, it's a great ride. You wont know what hit you at first, and soon you'll understand why \\"Triumph And Agony' is so highly respected by Metal fans world wide.....    Do yourself a favor. Even if you've never heard Warlock, or anything Doro has done as solo artist, buy this immediately. It's a classic Metal masterpiece, and your collection wont be complete without it....    Highly Recommended. Five Stars.
6304698798|5.0|I'm a little ashamed to say, I only watched \\"The good, the bad and the ugly\\" yesterday, after almost twenty years of listening to people tell me (good) things about it. Looking back, there could have happened that usual phenomenon, common when you expect too much of something before knowing it: when you watch/listen/read/get acquainted with this something, the expectations were so high that you feel disappointed. Thankfully, in this case that was not true.<br />\\"The good, the bad and the ugly\\" (GBU from now on) is better than I expected. A true classic western, this movie is divided in two parts. In the first, Sergio Leone presents his characters; Blondie, the good, by Clint Eastwood: squinty eyes, extremely laconic, a certain shot, dubious morals; Tuco, the ugly, by Eli Wallach (I remembered him from \\"The godfatther part III\\") a funny, stumbling, greedy and dangerous person. These two have an arrengement of sorts, deceiving local sheriffs and getting easy money. The third character is \\"Angel Eyes\\" Sentenza, the bad, by Lee Van Cleef. And he's really bad. I wouldn't want to cross my path with this man, with laughing, soft eyes and a stone-hard countenance, who will stop at nothing if he has to make a kill. I have hardly seen a better-fitting cast as the one displayed in GBU.<br />These three characters are, strangely, extremely well-developed during the movie, even if they are stereothypes to the bone. It's mostly them that make this movie unforgettable, together with Leone's extremely dedicated and personal direction.<br />Bottom line, as shown in the second half of the movie, the story is a treasure hunt (set in the middle of the Civil War - Leone shows, in GBU, what he thinks about the Vietnam War), and, in the Old West, no one could trust anybody. The final scene in the cemetery is pure genious, the slow takes showing the eyes and the hands of the contenders, fighting for their lives and a fortune in golden coins. All this permeated by Enio Morricone's fantastic soundscore - I think there's no one on Earth that doesn't know this tune.<br />That's to say: GBU has not aged in almost forty years. It keeps being a modern movie, that deals with human desires in a world withiout too much scruples. We still can relate, can't we?<br />Grade 9.3/10c soundscore - I think there's no one on Earth that doesn't know this tune. <br />That's to say: GBU has not aged in almost forty years.

0375751513|3.0|This story about a man whose wish for eternal youth comes true through a portrait of himself delves into numerous philosophical nether regions.  Set in upscale 19th century London, The Picture of Dorian Gray deals with such topics as truth, death, and most especially beauty.<br />Dorian Gray's portrait ages while he remains his youthful self.  Gray uses this to his advantage (let's be honest, who wouldn't?).  Gray breaks hearts, corrupts others, and avails himself of numerous vices...most notably opium.  Gray also takes advantage of his youth by learning new things...music and gemology come to mind.  But Gray's self-enhancement does not make up for the copious sins he commits, both large and small...and even though his face does not bely his crimes, the portrait's face does.<br />Wilde's play on eternal youth was almost certainly novel for the time.  These days the concept has been played out time again.  But I do not begrudge Wilde for this...in his time, he was an innovator.<br />Four major things irked me about this book:<br />First, the prose is overly flowery.  I don't read many books written in the 19th century...maybe most of the books were written like this. Second, Wilde seems to use this book as a platform to give us his take on philosophical issues large and small.  True, most good works of fiction are a reflection of the society in which the author lives, but Wilde is NOT subtle about giving us numerous opinions on art, love, life, beauty, etc.  I think he could have been a bit more subtle doing this.  Third most of characters seemed overly naive.  Granted, this story is supposed to be set in a time and place where the rich did not concern themselves with trivial matters.  Nonetheless...so much was going on under the characters' noses!  Even, Henry Wotton -- Gray's longtime friend -- seems to come down with a bout of extreme naivete toward the end of the book.  Somehow, this made the characters seem shallower than they otherwise might have been.  And my final gripe kind of ties in with the characters' overall naivete.  From the time that Dorian Gray is granted eternal youth by whatever powers that be, to the end of the book, nearly two decades elapse.  There is only one, very minor, mention of Gray's youthful looks toward the end of the book.  Didn't anyone notice that this guy has, supposedly, aged nearly twenty years and yet still appears as youthful as ever?  Come on, even these days with plastic surgery and $100+ cosmetic cream, a 40 year old doesn't look half his age.  Why did only Gray's closest friend only offhandedly mention this toward the end of the book?  Surely someone else must have noticed?<br />Wilde's concept had a lot of potential, and it certainly does make one ponder life's intangible mysteries, but Wilde spent to much time proselytizing his 19th century philosophy for this book to really stand out.  This book is only recommended to those who enjoy Wilde's other works.final gripe kind of ties in with the characters' overall naivete.

B00005JMJ4|3.0|No doubt, this movie is the defining accomplishment of Bill Murrary's long career.  Scarlet Johansson gives another fantastic performance (as in \\"Girl with the Pearl Earing\\").  What's more, their chemistry on screen is the best I've seen this year.  Certainly these are some of the tasty ingredients needed to cook up a great film, but as Sophia Coppola will learn in what figures to be a long and decorated directing career, you need something more.  At times while watching \\"Lost in Translation\\", I felt just that - lost. The relationship between Scarlett's character (the exact name eludes me) and her husband is not given enough time on screen for the audience to find out exactly why she is so unhappy with him, especially if her discontent is such that she is willing to persue a relationship with someone twice her age.  This is my main problem with the film among others, but I did rate the movie a three which, in my book, means it was good, not great, and not quite worthy of an Oscar (sorry Miss Copola). Like I said, the chemistry is definatley there, and that in itself makes the movie quite an enjoyable experience. Although this film fails to really get off the ground in terms of the plot (or lack thereof) and leaves much to be desired , it succeeds in capturing the beautiful simplicity of needing someone - if only for a single, vulnerable moment.
0064409422|4.0|I chose to read this classic by C.S. Lewis because every one else I knew had read it when they were younger.  I was told that it was an allegorical novel by a friend, which spiked my interest in what I considered just a child's fantasy.  Lewis fills his world, Narnia, with a wonderful array of different and interesting characters.  Fauns, Nymphs, Dryads, Naiads, and hospitable beavers all contribute to the fantastic nature of this story.  Lewis must have been a creative man to imagine such wonders and write them down.  A place where perpetually deadened by the cold of winter, with no Christmas and, therefore, no hope would be a terribly bleak setting.  The depiction of Aslan as a symbol of Christ was quite interesting.  Even the girls, Susan and Lucy, become similar to the two Marys in the gospel in their caretaking of the lion.  So as not to give away the story to anyone else I will end saying this unique world provides more than just a fantasy escape.  To both children and adults it provides a reminder that there is hope, even in our world, when it too seems cold and dead.

B000003TAB|2.0|I saw it in Punk; I saw it in English New Wave; and I saw it in Nirvana:  No talent whatsoever.<br />Let's examine what Nirvana 'accomplished'...<br />They made sloppy music a fad.  They made a mockery of the idea of music.  Consequently --and I'd've blown off Cobain's head myself had I prognosticated this disaster beforehand-- this has allowed thousands of other wanna-bes to provide us with THEIR sloppy, ridiculously petulant &quot;music--&quot; essentially just cut-outs from Nirvana's noise.  The fact is that Nirvana lowered the bar, and greedy MTV helped them --no doubt because their cronies, the garlic-fearing record execs, loved the fact that their new &quot;artists&quot; required little maintenence during recording and while on tour, thus higher profits.  Duh.  <br />Good job everyone for praising blatant sloppiness; it's encouraged one-hit-legends like Candlebox, and horrific acts of audible destruction like Puddle of Mudd, Stone Temple Pilots, and Staind.<br />Keep buying Nirvana's stuff, you guys...  Keep perpetuating a genre that encourages the sloppiest assemblage of instuments known to evolved man (you're not 'evolved' if you take seriously this blatant, greedy chicanery)...  Bequeath to your kin this ghastly excuse for &quot;music,&quot; only to continue to make the record executives richer and richer...  Thanks, y'all...  <br />Oh, yeah:  And keep making Eminem richer, too; he's SO proven himself to be such a passionate rap-meister with his hood-boys in D-12.  HAHAHAHAHA  They're practically laughing at the fact that you all buy his music.  More on that on my review of THEM...
B0001AVZA8|4.0|Nancy Meyers (What Women Want) wrote and directed this charming romance starring Diane Keaton as a successful but lonely playwright and Jack Nicholson as a successful music producer who has never dated a woman over 30.  Amanda Peet and Keanu Reeves handle their supporting roles quite well, though the storyline for their characters is not as well written, and Frances McDormand and Jon Favreau are terrific in their small parts but are, unfortunately, underused.<br />The true pleasure of the film lies in the interactions between Keaton and Nicholson, who make you appreciate what good acting is all about, even as they make it look easy.  They are terrific onscreen together.  The film holds together just fine until the last half hour, when the action moves to New York and becomes less intimate, and the ending is much too trite and tidy.  Nonetheless, I would recommend the film based on the first two-thirds, which are completely enjoyable.<br />The film can be heard in English or French, and can be subtitled in English, French or Spanish.  Extras include two commentary tracks -- one with Meyers, Keaton and producer Bruce Block, and one with Meyers and Nicholson.

1401300901|1.0|To start things out, I have to say I haven't read anything so horribly immature since I was in the third grade. I doubt anyone would have the gall to publish this book if it weren't for the fact that Ahern is the Prime Minister's daughter. The writing is forced and boring, the sub-plots just plain stupid, and the characters disgustingly stereotypical. Most of the chapters seemed to be 'fillers'. I was disappointed because Cecelia had a good idea and managed to ruin it with bad writing. I can't even tell you how many times she compared a person in shock to a goldfish. I should have known better, considering I heard about it from an article that only mentioned the book in two sentences. Perhaps it's just because I'm used to reading literature, but this book was nothing more than chick lit, and bad chick lit at that.
B00003CXCT|5.0|I must say it is nice to see the original trilogy on DVD.  I had got the set on VHS sometime back, which looks good, but is already starting to show wear and tear.  The first film remains the standout picture in this series.  Loosely based on Kurosawa's Hidden Fortress, it incorporates a wide variety of science fiction themes into an action-packed adventure. Empire Strikes Back and Return of the Jedi lack the initial punch, but taken as a whole it is an immensely rewarding set.  The prequels are more spectacular in terms of scope but nothing compares to the impact these movies had on the general public when they came out in the late 70's and early 80's.  2001: A Space Odyssey lavishly portrayed space but took a decidely existential approach to the subject, whereas Star Wars treated space as a wild frontier.  It has spawned a slew of imitators but few have matched the vigor of this great series.
B00005JMCW|4.0|This is the remake of the 1977 original starring one child star Jodie Foster.  Anyone who said remakes stink should reconsider his idea, for the newer &quot;Freaky Friday&quot; is one of the delightful family pictures Disney gave us in this decade.<br />The body-switching story is simple enough.  Tess Coleman (Jamie Lee Curtis) is an upright and principled psychatrist (and widow) who is busy preparing for the coming marriage, and her daughter Anna (Lindsay Lohan) is a high school student who wants to have a date with a boy, play rock music; in short, she needs a little bit more freedom.<br />Then, at a Chinese restaurant, they embarrasingly argue in front of the mother's love Ryan (Mark Harmon).  And then, the owner of the place offers a pair of fortune cookie, which, believe it or mot, have a magical power to change the roles of mother and daughter.  Tess is in Anna's body, and Anna in Tess's.<br />We know where &quot;Freaky Friday&quot; will lead you eventually, so let's wait for the film to be better and funnier as it goes on.  The first 20 minutes may look too banal, following the storyline of typical family pictures (a kid in detention class, mother worrying about her, and so on ...), but that is exactly the point.  After their bodies are switched, the things get wild, crazy, and funny ... probably more funnier than you expect.<br />That is all because of the two great leading ladies -- Jamie Lee Curtis and Lindsay Lohan (the latter played the double roles in &quot;The Parent Trap,&quot; another good remake).  The way Lee Curtis changes the make-up (in the punk fashion, of course) and takes over the TV show with comic talk is one of the many highlights of the film.  With her, Lohan always gives an amusing contrast as a rebellous daughter, then a dutiful one.  (The only reason I do not give five stars is Chinese restaurant setting which looks trite to me -- and I didn't want to see Rosalind Chao in this way -- and its slightly weaker supporting actors).<br />Andmost of all, what is great about the film is that Jamie Lee Curtis and Lindsay Lohan are not only great talents but also they are having fun doing what they can do.  And this fun is very contagious -- the kind of fun we can all share.
B0000060NH|5.0|Along with Curtis Mayfield, Edwin Starr and James Brown among others, Marvin Gaye also produced and compilated this release, which was mostly a jazz instrumental album and it's truly brilliant and in a sense funky. Marvin truly shines in every album he had done since he found artistic control following his brilliant &quot;What's Going On&quot; album. It's just simply one brilliant collection! Props to the man even though the Grammys took more than 20 years until his &quot;comeback&quot; to get him his rightful due props! Grade-A masterpiece!
0553378384|5.0|\\"The sign in which the North Node falls denotes the psychological shift that need to occur within the personality. The house containing the North Node shows the experiences that allow the person to access this new psychological awareness...The South Node position in a chart (located at the point exactly opposite of the North Node) depicts an aspect in our character that has been overemphasized in past lives, and thus tends to take over the personality in this lifetime and throw us off balance. When we are acting without awareness, we tend to 'act out' the South Node position in response to our environment because we have been accustomed to that approach working to our advantage. However, in this lifetime, our experiences show us that approaching a situation from the stance shown by the position of the Southern Node of our chart is no longer working...\\" -- Jan Spiller in Astrology For The Soul<br /><br />In her book Astrology for the Soul, astrologer Jan Spiller shows you the key to discovering your hidden talents, deepest desires, and the ways to avoid negative influences that may distract you from achieving your true life purpose, as revealed by the North Node of the Moon in your natal astrological chart. Although Spiller mostly uses the term North Node, she takes into consideration that the North Node exists in polarity with the South Node--and how they both manifest in our attitude, personality, and drive.<br /><br />To discover your North Node, you need to generate a chart. You can do this by going to Astro.com Once you enter the birth time, date, and place a chart will be generated. Chart Drawing, Ascendant is where generated charts are stored. To find your North Node (NN) look for the glyph (symbol) that looks like a horseshow with curlicues on the end. The South Node (NN) will be in the House directly opposite the North Node, although it won't be pictured. The symbol for the SN is an inversion of the NN glyph. You also can also find your NN placement by gettng software like Mapping Your Birthchart.<br /><br />In Astrology For The Soul each of the 12 Nodal positions are examined in areas like:<br /><br />*Attributes to develop<br />*What these people really want<br />*Talents/Profession<br />*Healing Affirmations<br />*Personality<br />*Needs<br />*Relationships<br />*Goals<br />*Healing theme songs<br /><br />Here is a small sample of Attributes to Develop for each of the 12 Nodal positions as described in this book:<br /><br />Aries - Independence, trusting one's impulses, and self-nurturance<br /><br />Taurus - Honoring expressed needs of self and others, forgiveness, and gratitude.<br /><br />Gemini - Tact, logic, and listening.<br /><br />Cancer - Empathy, humility, and accepting others flaws without judgment.<br /><br />Leo - Individuality, self-confidence, and enthusiasm.<br /><br />Virgo - Moderation, creating routines, and taking risks in spite of fears.<br /><br />Libra - Cooperation, seeing through another's eyes, creating win/win situations.<br /><br />Scorpio - Self-discipline, choosing constructive change, and enjoying high-risk situations.<br /><br />Sagittarius - Patience, speaking from Higher Consciousness, and intuitive listening.<br /><br />Capricorn - Self-control, self-respect, and letting go of the past.<br /><br />Aquarius - Objectivity, desire for friendship, and active participation in groups.<br /><br />Pisces - Compassion, surrending anxiety to a Higher Power, and welcoming change.<br /><br />I highly recommend this informative book for releasing negative life patterns, embracing your strengths, and living a more centered and self-directed life.g software like Mapping Your Birthchart.<br /><br />In Astrology For The Soul each of the 12 Nodal positions are examined in areas like:<br /><br />*Attributes to develop<br />*What these people really want<br />*Talents/Profession<br />*Healing Affirmations<br />*Personality<br />*Needs<br />*Relationships<br />*Goals<br />*Healing theme songs<br /><br />Here is a small sample of Attributes to Develop for each of the 12 Nodal positions as described in this book:<br /><br />Aries - Independence, trusting one's impulses, and self-nurturance<br /><br />Taurus - Honoring expressed needs of self and others, forgiveness, and gratitude.<br /><br />Gemini - Tact, logic, and listening.<br /><br />Cancer - Empathy, humility, and accepting others flaws without judgment.<br /><br />Leo - Individuality, self-confidence, and enthusiasm.<br /><br />Virgo - Moderation, creating routines, and taking risks in spite of fears.<br /><br />Libra - Cooperation, seeing through another's eyes, creating win/win situations.<br /><br />Scorpio - Self-discipline, choosing constructive change, and enjoying high-risk situations.<br /><br />Sagittarius - Patience, speaking from Higher Consciousness, and intuitive listening.<br /><br />Capricorn - Self-control, self-respect, and letting go of the past.<br /><br />Aquarius - Objectivity, desire for friendship, and active participation in groups.<br /><br />Pisces - Compassion, surrending anxiety to a Higher Power, and welcoming change.<br /><br />I highly recommend this informative book for releasing negative life patterns, embracing your strengths, and living a more centered and self-directed life.
B00003CX8I|1.0|First off, I'm not going to say anything about the quality of the video or anything, because I'm not concerned with things like that.<br />I got X-Men and X-Men2, along with another movie, at a Used Sale, all for about $10. I had never seen any of these movies, and, as a fan of the recent animated series, X-Men Evolution, I decided to give the movies a try. <BR>And maybe my expectations were too high, but I thought that they were both horrific movies. The acting was okay. Hugh Jackman was an excellent choice for Wolverine, and he did a nice job. Ian McKellen also did very well as Magneto, I think. The rest of the acting was mediocre to upsetting. <br />Not only that, the characters barely had any personality. All the viewer knows about Jean Grey is that she's smart and pretty and nice. Scott Summers (Cyclopes) loves Jean. (That's really the only emotion that he is allowed to show.) Rogue is a little girl frightened of her powers. Logan (Wolverine) is a tough cookie. Everything the movie tells us about them is just simple, stereotypical, on-the-surface facts. The characters have no individual personality. They all seem to have the same sense of humor, say the same things... blah blah blah. So the script was terrible.<br />The one thing I can give you is that the story was great, but credit to that goes to the comic. So. I'll have to take that compliment back. There was absolutely nothing good about this movie.<br />Well... the computer graphics were pretty good.
B00005JKN9|3.0|GANGS OF NEW YORK strives for greatness, but falls short. <br />The original screenplay drafts for this film were basicallyl a Civil War-era version of GOODFELLAS. While that might or might not have worked better, what ended up on the screen is a unfocused and unbalanced mish-mash of ideas and themes that never add up to a full movie. Scorsese tries to shove Irish immigration, the Civil War, street gangs, political corruption, Protestant/Catholic conflict, a romance story, a revenge story, a father/son story, and several other ideas into one 3-hour movie and winds up with a massively overproduced history lesson. <br />The film seems to be trying to say so many things, but winds up saying nothing. The characters are throwaway (save Daniel Day Lewis) and the storyline is so sloppy that it's a challenge to remain interested. The elaborate sets, initially impressive, start looking cheap and low-budget since they're continuously rephotographed from different angles throughout the film. And the editing is absolutely awful, a sure sign that they were desperate to make this film work but couldn't.<br />Scorsese lived with this project for over 20 years, with several different storylines and plots that changed radically (the 1993 script, like I said before, was basically GOODFELLAS....it was all about the gangs, with little emphasis on Irish immigrants) and in the end, I think, lost all sight of what he wanted.
0385484518|5.0|What can I say?  Morrie was a great man.  The book was a big inspiration to me.  It made me look at life in a whole new light.  I always knew how death worked but i never knew how to react to it or prepare for it.  Morrie taught me that life is so short and  that you must live it to the fullest every single day.  One of my best friends sisters has this same disease and i see how it affects the human body.  I was really suprised by the strength that Morrie had to tell Mitch about all those life lessons.  This book was great and i will keep it in my mind always.
B00018D44U|1.0|I loved &quot;Feels Like Home&quot;, but this album is terrible.  The music is unbelievably boring.  The only decent song is the duet with Dolly Parton.  The rest of the music lacks any real substance.  Waste of my money!!

B000089CJI|4.0|The District Sleeps Alone Tonight -(5/5)- This is a great, soft opener to the CD and it's my favorite song. The chorus is awesome.<br />Such Great Heights -(4/5)- This song has a cool beat going on throughout it, which builds up to a stronger one as the song progresses.<br />Sleeping In -(5/5)- Another good song. The lyrics can be somewhat random at times, but still it's an awesome song.<br />Nothing Better -(5/5)- This is my 2nd favorite song on the album. It's a great song, with good lyrics, and I love the duet.<br />Recycled Air -(5/5)- A somewhat softer song, but a very good one. A nice interval between some of the more poppy songs. <br />Clark Gable -(3.5/5)- This is a decent song, but since it's at the end, it just isn't anything new from the other songs, so it gets a 3.5.<br />We Will Become Sillhouttes -(3.5/5)- Same thing as above. Decent song. Nothing New.<br />This Place is a Prison -(5/5)- This song saves the end of the CD, which I was getting bored by this point. This is a great song, and luckily it is here.<br />Brand New Colony -(4/5)- Many people like this song because of the Mario theme. However, this is why I dislike it, I find the Mario music quite annoying. But during the verses when the Mario theme goes off, the song is awesome!<br />Natural Anthem -(5/5)- Good finish to the album.<br />I'm giving this CD a light 4 stars, very close to a 3. This album is a great freshman effort by the Postal Service and many songs are fantastic. However, in the middle of the CD I got a little bored because it was lacking a little bit of new sounds. But the end picked it up again, and left the CD with a good finish. Overall, this is a very good CD, it might take a few listens to enjoy it if you're not used to synth. But I would recommend buying this.
B00005KHJR|5.0|This is a cult film , in a good way . It has such a great sense of intelligence and atmosphere , great acting , fine script and will remain with you . Of course , you may hate it . An interesting point is that a number of scenes were cut out of the film , including some of Christopher Lee's . This happened to him again with the last Lord of the Rings film - talk about unlucky ! His scenes will appear on the Extended DVD , though .   Highly recommended . Other films with a creepy atmosphere include CARNIVAL OF SOULS ( the Criterion version is preferred ) , STRAW DOGS ( Criterion again , but now out of print ). Rent it if you are unsure .
B0000DZTIW|5.0|Im a &quot;fan&quot; of Zimmer and all his works, and I think this is genial. The amazing sound of &quot;Taken&quot; and his percussion are excellent.<BR>For me, the best song is &quot;Taken&quot; and &quot;Spectres in The Fog&quot;, because they are the main themes of Algren (Cruise) and Katsumoto (Watanabe).
B0000AXE8I|5.0|I was absolutely dissapointed with the finale &quot;Revolutions&quot; because it falls short of what &quot;Releaded&quot; was. &quot;Reloaded&quot; is a fun sci-fi action movie that is a great follow up to the 1999 original. <br /> In this one the machines are digging closer towards humanity's last stronghold called Zion and a renegade computer program Agent Smith has broken away from the Matrix and Neo along with Trinity, Morpheus, and Mifune are preparing for the massive battle ahead but have several obstacles to overcome before then. <br /> The special effects are absolutely amazing and are eye-popping especially towards the latter part of the movie. The acting is also really good too, something that isn't so with the third Matrix Movie. <br /> The second disc is a lot of fun too containing really awesome behind the scenes features, and excellent commentary by the producers, cast, and director. In all honesty, this item gets a five just for disc two which in all honesty, the making of was even better than the final movie itself!
B00003CXXP|1.0|It's not so much that I resent the waste of money so much as the waste of time watching it.  Sappy and just plain dumb, (alot like Spielberg) this one is destined for the trash heap, even if you are a sci-fi fan.  With this piece of garbage the average viewer must feel as if his/her intelligence is in question.  Just say &quot;No!&quot;.
B0001AVZA8|2.0|Yes, Keaton and Nicholson do a great job. But the script has at least 3 cliches per second and everything is predictable, even the food they coose to eat.
B0000399WI|5.0|I haven't actually experienced the DVDs, so I can't comment on it specifically, but hear me out. Also, these two are *always* thought of together, so here goes:  I've watched both The Shawshank Redemption and The Green Mile more than once before reading the books.  If I *have to* pick one movie as my all-time favourite, it would be The Shawshank Redemption.  The book is really brilliant, but I'm of the opinion that the movie did the unthinkable and actually improved on it.  In my mind, the situation is reversed when it comes to The Green Mile.  Although the movie is really brilliant, the book is better.  Maybe the reason is that The Green Mile doesn't get the words and ideas as Stephen King uses them into the movie as exceptionally successful as The Shawshank Redemption.  Still, both of them are worth every dollar and every minute (and I'm able to say this even after seeing Shawshank about 8 times and Green Mile more than 3)!
6304698623|2.0|Okay, maybe it's because this was designed to be a &quot;children's movies&quot; and the powers that be decided acting was not a priority...  I can overlook that the people in the movie are caricatures and stereotypes more than developed individuals.  Okay, the main character is unbelievably good and the school master is unreasonably mean.  That is to be expected.  The problem for me was that every time a character opened their mouth I cringed at what came out.<br />The plot was good, but I was amazed at how terrible the acting was.  It was as if the children were asked to read their lines in the most sugary tones possible.  Especially the main character.<br />I think &quot;children's movies&quot; can certainly have layers to their characters and can feature actors that can actually act.  Unfortunately, this is not one of those movies.
0679735909|4.0|I have to admit that this is not light reading. I found that in some spots it was very tough to get through because it was slow but completely hang-in there, it gets better. <br />What makes Byatt's work beautiful is the language she uses. It's not typical 21st century writing, it goes back to the Victorian period feel that she tried to evoke and suceeds. Her main protagonists, Roland and Maud were very intriguing characters and the side characters were fascinating as well.<br />I also loved the themes that she uses, male versus female, etc. It was a hard read but I want to go back to it; go through it and I love books like that.
B00005QEO1|2.0|Aerosmith was one of the most important bands of the 1970's hard rock/heavy metal scene. But in the early 80's, their albums sales began to slip. But the made a so-called comeback in the late eighties. But they completely abandoned the rough, raw sound for a commercial atrocity. They thought they could pull off being a glam band. Believe me, they don't have the looks for it. This ain't even rock anymore. This is just pure commercial pop/rock. This is pathetic. Janie's Got A Gun is okay, but if your'e expecting Toys In The Attic, your'e not gonna get it here.
B00005JMJ4|1.0|I hadn't seen this movie in theatres and heard a lot of good things about it. So when i saw it at the store it became an automatic purchase. As i watched the film i kept waiting for something funny to happen, which didn't. There were some parts that would make you smirk but otherwise this was a boring film. I wouldn't recommend this to anyone for purchase or even rental. Wait until it comes on cable and then you will also wonder why such a talented actor like Bill Murray would waste his time with this movie. It received great reviews but those people must like watching boring, bland movies. Not really a comedy.
0061015725|4.0|I'm a programmer so this book peaked my interest and I just had to read it. Not many books have a programmer as their hero. Crichton uses a lot of programmer stereotypes which was kind of funny for someone who knows better. I'm assuming you've already read what the book is about so I'll give you my impression of it.<br />This book was pretty well written and excellently researched, as you would expect from Crichton. The characters are well developed and have some depth and history. It's a fast read and exciting throughout (unlike the life of a programmer). Like all his books it reads like a movie script, nicely separated into distinct scenes. He spends a lot of time explaining technology but does it in an understandable way. It definitely helps if you know something about computers though. <br />Near the end of the book things start to get a little unbelievable, but you just have to remind yourself that it is fiction. I thought the speed at which the artificial life evolves was unrealistic, but then I started doing some research with genetic algorithms and found that things really do evolve pretty fast on a computer. You can go through hundreds of generations in less than a second. But there has to be some kind of defined goal the evolution is trying to achieve. The kind of evolution that is achived in this book is pure fantasy. So I wouldn't go out and lock myself in an airtight room just yet.<br />Anyway, I think it will make a good movie in a couple years. Can't wait to see it. It's not one of the best books I've ever read but I give it 4 stars for being above average.
B000005ALN|4.0|Bought this CD when it came out and like it just as much now as then. Really like the sense of melancholy about it. It's clear George is quite sad and bitter at this point in his life and if you're feeling down, this is really soothing. The message, I think, is hopeful, though: &quot;I'll be fine&quot; sings George. Also it's a very honest album, unlike much music by superstars. Strangest Thing about the best thing George has done and agree the You Have Been Loved is outstanding.
B00006DEF9|5.0|Being raised by my grandmother as much as my mother (and later, my aunt) meant that I got exposed to two different generations of entertainment; Grandma was a punk rocker and Mom was a classical violinist, you see, and . . .<BR> <BR>Okay, not really. I learned about rock and roll and modern films from my mother, while my grandmother exposed me to classic cinema and the swing sounds of her 1940's heyday. And I have a lot of treasured memories from my childhood, moreso I think than some others my age, mostly because of that dichotomous upbringing.<BR> <BR>One of my most treasured memories from that time is watching Singin' in the Rain, which, along with The Wizard of Oz, is one of the first movies I remember seeing. And of the two, Singin' in the Rain is by far more memorable, and touching, and full of the joy of life.<br />For the benefit of those who have been living under a rock for the last sixty or seventy years, Singin' is a musical about the coming of sound films to Hollywood, and it features Donald O'Connor, Debbie Reynolds, and Cyd Charisse-but its star is Gene Kelly, who in my opinion is the greatest dancer/choreographer who ever graced an American sound stage. Only Jerome Robbins, George Ballanchine, and Martha Graham did more than he did to modernize and Americanize dancing-and of them all, only Kelly brought his sensibilities to the screen before the majority of the country, and then the world. And Singin' in the Rain, which Kelly co-directed with Stanley Donen, is his crowning achievement.<br />The film centers around Don Lockwood (Kelly), silent movie star and one half of the team of Lockwood and Lamont-Lamont being Lena Lamont, played by the era's platinum blonde queen of ditz, Jean Hagen. The story is nominally a satire about how talking pictures changed the way film was made-but really, let's be honest. The story, as good as it is, and as funny as it is, is just an excuse to get to the superb song-and-dance numbers included here: &quot;Ready for Love,&quot; the first of two fantastic pairings with O'Connor; &quot;All I Do (Is Dream of You),&quot; a showcase for then-unknown Debbie Reynolds; &quot;Make `Em Laugh,&quot; O'Connor's delightful, hysterical showstopper; &quot;Good Morning, Good Morning,&quot; a thrilling trio dance with Kelly, O'Connor, and Reynolds; and so many other moments, it's difficult to list them all here because it would literally take me hours-but here's a couple more anyway:<br />There's the &quot;Moses&quot; dance with O'Connor and Kelly, a driving, percussive swingtime number that showcases both dancers to the best of their abilities. Watching the two trading steps, as the music becomes faster and more manic, is truly thrilling. <br />There's the &quot;Broadway Ballet&quot; sequence, the culmination of Kelly's dream-sequence ballets in films like On the Town and An American in Paris. It's an epiphany of dance, an exciting, sensual journey through the life and times of a Broadway hoofer that features exquisite art direction, cinematography that is every bit as well-choreographed as Kelly's dancing-and best of all, it has Cyd Charisse, with her scowling face and mile-long legs, in some of the most heartstoppingly gorgeous dancing I have ever seen in my life. The ballet climaxes the film in fantastic fashion-and does it so well, in fact, that the film's actual denouement seems almost anticlimactic.<br />Then there's &quot;Singin' in the Rain&quot; itself-a winning, classy, classic number, overbrimming with high spirits and Kelly's love of life. The sheer genius of Kelly, in the rain, with an umbrella, singing Arthur Freed's simple but elegant love song, twirling and splashing and spinning (and above all, smiling), gets me every time. There is a wonderful, childlike abandon in what Kelly achieves in this scene. Leonard Bernstein once called it &quot;a reaffirmation of life,&quot; but it's more than that. In a way, &quot;Singin' in the Rain&quot; is life, the best part of life; its magnificence, its majesty, its magic, its humor and sadness, and the beauty there is to be found in the simplest things. That alone makes Singin' in the Rain worth watching . . . because in the end, that's everything, isn't it? I know for me it is; Gene Kelly at his best-and in this film he is not just at his best but at his peak-is an encapsulation of everything that is good in life.<br />Kelly himself said it best: &quot;That's what you do up there. You dance love, and you dance joy . . . and you dance dreams.&quot; <br />How can you go wrong with something that good?<br />Thanks, Grandma, for sharing it with me.
B000089RVX|5.0|i love the cd. there an awesome band. the best i know. my favorite songs are tourniquet, taking over me, and my last breath. anyone who who sont like them should keep it to themselves and not even come here so bite it and stay away.
B00005K9LN|4.0|While many other reviewers call this the greatest album ever. Screaming For Vengeance and Ram It Down, in my opinion, are better. The first side is better than the second. The songs are less commercial and more hard-walloping. Rapid Fire, the opening track, is the perfect metal anthem with the line &quot;Pounding the world like a battering ram&quot;. The next song, Metal Gods, is slightly less heavy, but still great. Breaking The Law is a great song with an awesome video. Grinder and United are cool, too. This is a good album.
B000005JA8|5.0|Not for everyone, and that's OK. That's why we have the Beach Boys and the Beatles to listen to. Not truly Dadaist, far too serious for that, and not nihilistic enough. Pop Art in a Edward Ruscha sort of way. Smart over clever. Biting over cutting.<br />Plus, TMR contains one of the nicest tributes to Alan Lomax I have ever heard, almost matched by Gavin Bryars &quot;Jesus Blood Never Failed Me Yet&quot;, but not quite.
B000002WU9|5.0|This album right here is a classic.  By far the best album a Wu Tang member has ever put out.  There is not one song that I will not bump hard as hell even though it has been out for 10 years plus.  This was an album that young and upcoming rappers can listen to the jewels and knowledge to step they game up to be a successful rap artist.
B000089RVR|5.0|This is a mature cd about love and loss. &quot;White Flag&quot; is a heartbreaking song about secretly carrying the torch for someone when the relationship is over. &quot;Stoned&quot; is about an emotionally distant lover. &quot;Life for Rent&quot; is about being afraid to commit to relationship. &quot;See You When Your 40&quot; is about realizing that your lover is an immature fake and finally deciding to end it. &quot;Don't Leave Home&quot; is about a controlling co-dependent relationship told from the point of view of the controller. Sounds depressing so far, huh? In &quot;Sand in My Shoes&quot; (things start looking up) she's met someone while on holiday and realizes that she wants to see him again. &quot;This Land is Mine&quot; - she's ready for a relationship again but on her terms. &quot;See the Sun&quot; - is about coming to terms with a breakup, she tells her friend its time to stop grieving and move on &quot;I promise you you'll see the sun again&quot;. The songs all have good melodies set to a hypnotic trip-hop beat. They sound very personal, very real. Thanks Dido - good luck in the future - I love your cd.
B0001AP12G|3.0|Kanye, Kanye , Kanye this album would have been tight if you didn't rap on it at all.  He is probably the best producer out right now, I mean, he's a genius when it comes to beats.  Now don't get me wrong there is a couple of hot bangin joints on this LP.  But lyrically not talented at all.  But if you like that non-complex, simple bull than this is the album that is for you.
B00006JJ1O|5.0|This lesbian drama - russian style is a great concept album. It's campy fun with a socio-political message. Their love is so strong that, against all odds, they will fight to be together. The album is produced very well w/ Trevor Horn at the helm. The catchy songs have a dark dramatic sound, yet the girls' high pitched voices have a youthful earnest energy. I envision them fleeing from the state police and german shepherds are chasing them over a dark barren landscape w/ lots of barbed wire. Like I said it's a concept album that's very much over the top, but that's what makes it so much fun. I like the Russian feel to it too. The piano solo in \\"30 minutes\\" reminds me of \\"Nadia's Theme\\". The last song, Stars, starts off with a sweet voice singing \\"how did we ever go this far, you touch my hand and start the car....\\" Then the other one starts rapping in Russian. I don't know what she's saying, but the desperate determination conveyed in her voice is best left to the imagination...let's get the *#*^#@* out of here! The song ends abruptly with beeeeeeep...fill in the blank...maybe they crashed (maybe they did a Thelma and Louise and drove over a cliff), maybe they escaped or...to be continued. The cd takes you on a journey where the girls must escape an oppressive society to \\"someplace where no one calls it wrong\\". As a gay man living in America, life is pretty good, but there still is prejudism and injustice so I can relate to the girls' drama on a symbolic level or as a gay nightmare.
0345455681|1.0|The 800+ pages of this book did not deter me at all.  I read Sarum and liked it.  It was not perfect, but it was good enough for me to seek out this author again.  London, however, was a different matter.  I read - DRAGGED - myself through the first 38 pages and found the initial characters so completely boring that I could have cared less what became of them.  My normal rule is 100+ before making a decision to close a book, and I think I've only ever closed 1 or 2.  This one is now added to that short list.  In fairness, it may get better - it may have turned out to be a thrilling, moving piece of literary work.  Unfortunately, the beginning was SO bad that I don't even care if it gets better.  I not only closed it - I donated it to the library.  Maybe an nice insomniac will find it helpful.
B0000524CY|4.0|I've never really been a fan of 70s horror movies, but this is one that quite literally scares the s**t out of me! I've seen it before, a few years ago, but after much persuasion, sat down again in front of the DVD, to relive the horror. This DVD version is apparently \\"the version you've never seen\\", with an extra 11 minutes of scenes and images deleted before the original release of the movie.<br />Having been a few years since I've seen the movie, and having tried to block most of it since (although I've read the book), I was interested to see it again. Apart from having to ignore the extremely 70s look of the movie, it's not instantly gripping. The start is slow, and wasn't really necessary, apart from Father Merrin's introduction.<br />The extra scenes include a \\"nervous disorder\\" diagnosis for Reagan; Father Merrin's arrival has been expanded before the ritual; an epilogue with Lt. Kinderman and Father Dyer; and most notably, the spider walk. The latter of which is one of the freakiest scenes in the movie, despite being horrifically short, and no more than a quick glimpse.<br />One of the scenes that I hated in this movie, is the scene where Regan (such a sweet innocent girl to begin with) is violently masturbating (bloodily) with a crucifix, while swearing obscenely, and nearly giving her mother a nervous breakdown. That is one scene that will stay with me, and had me crossing my legs afterwards, and for the rest of the movie. It's graphically described in the book, but to see it in the movie, and then pushing her mother's face into it, is horrible. Not a scene I wish to see again! I remember reading this scene in the book, and having it sicken me. There's a scene before this, where she masturbates, but it doesn't have much of an effect. I thought from that scene that she was supposed to do it with a crucifix, but I got told that they couldn't possibly put a young girl through that. Well, by God, William Friedkin and William Peter Blatty showed that, and on a young girl, albeit possessed by the devil, and made it to shock! In this disturbing scene Linda Blair said she had no idea what it was supposed to mean, she was just bringing down the crucifix into a box.<br />Most of this movie focuses on Regan (played by Linda Blair) and what happens to her, and her mother. There's also more focus on the Gabriel Byrne lookalike Father Karras (Jason Miller), and his relationship with his mother, which is seen more during the exorcism.<br />Linda Blair could have gone onto bigger and better things after this movie, but really, she hasn't. Whether it's been a choice of bad scripts, or just always being known as \\"the girl from The Exorcist\\", she's rarely been seen on the big screen. Apart from minor roles in one of the sequels to The Exorcist, and a reporter role in one of the Scream movies, she'll always be known for playing Regan.<br />Why there were sequels to such a great film? In my opinion, they could never have bettered this movie, and just wanted to cash in on its success. A film that should have been better left untouched, and un-sequeled, although I don't think that's a real word. It ruins the original, and I for one, do not want to see the sequels, as they're no doubt rubbish, and the same story, just with different actors.<br />There are actually two versions of this DVD out, or maybe even more! The version I own is the one with extended/new scenes, but not much in the way of extras. The extras on this DVD are: trailers; feature length commentary by William Friedkin; TV spots \\"Most Electrifying\\", \\"Scariest Ever\\", \\"Returns\\" and \\"Never Seen\\" and two radio spots \\"The Devil Himself\\" and \\"Our Deepest Fears\\". The other DVD has more extras, but doesn't have the extended scenes. So which do you go for? They're both equally interesting, and are done to milk you of your hard-earned pennies. If I see the other one at a decent price, with the extras, I'll be getting it.<br />This movie is not for the fainthearted, and although you'llmanage to block out the boring opening scenes (which don't really do much for the rest of the movie), most of the movie will stay with you. What will you remember most from this? The festering wounds maybe? The projectile vomiting and head spinning? (Lovely) Or perhaps, the climax (almost quite literally for Regan) of the movie, the exorcism? For me, it will be that crucifix scene (legs now firmly crossed!).<br />What we need next is a special edition DVD which combines the contents of all the ones currently available, i.e. extended scenes, and loads of extras, including the 74 minute documentary available on the video special edition.u'll manage to block out the boring opening scenes (which don't really do much for the rest of the movie), most of the movie will stay with you.

0385484518|5.0|Tuesdays with Morrie is a book that got me to reasses my own life.  It basically tells you to live life on a day to day basis because you dont know if it is going to be your last.  I would recomenned this book to anyone. Morrie is a fantastic person that teaches not only Mitch the greatest lessons of life but the readers as well. He teaches us the greatest lesson of life.  Some of lessons dealt with fear, emotions, marraige, death, and aging.  Once you have completed reading the book it is as if you were right there with Mitch and Morrie.
B000063DFN|5.0|This is arguably one of Iron Maiden's best albums.  When they were in their primetime.  <br />1. ACES HIGH (9.5/10)<BR>A great fast paced opener!  Definitely not as good as Prowler but still awesome.  Great guitars and chorus makes this an instant classic. <br />2. 2 MINUTES TO MIDNIGHT (9.5/10)<BR>Another classic with a great chorus.  The intro riffs are cool.<br />3. LOSFER WORDS (BIG 'ORRA) (8.75/10)<BR>Yet another instrumental.  This one's pretty cool.  Not as good as Genghis Khan or Transylvania though.<br />4. FLASH OF THE BLADE (9/10)<BR>Has fast paced riffs and drums.  Great song, great chorus.<br />5. THE DUELLISTS (8.5/10)<BR>Not a bad one, just nothing special.  It has a pretty good instrumental part.<br />6. BACK IN THE VILLAGE (8.75/10)<BR>This is also a good one, but the chorus sounds kind of stupid.<br />7. POWERSLAVE (10/10)<BR>Hell yeah!  This song rocks.  The riffs sound all Egyptian.  Sweet guitars and chorus.  I really like the instrumental part in the middle, its awesome!<br />8. RIME OF THE ANCIENT MARINER (10/10)<BR>Now this is an epic!  Wow 13 minutes long!  It doesn't even seem that long because this song is so cool.  Everybody does an excellent job on this song!  I would've given this song an extra point if the bass part wasn't as long as it was (2 1/2 minutes).  It should've been 1 1/2 minutes max.  Anyway,incredible song overall.<br />If you don't have Powerslave, you're a fool!  Go get this metal masterpiece!
B00007KQA3|2.0|One of my favorite movies, and one of John Hurt's best performances (which is saying a lot, considering his general exellence).  But the surreal electronica of the Eurythmics soundtrack has been totally removed, and replaced with dour, droning orchestral strings.  This really sinks it for me, I'm afraid.  After waiting so long to have this film on DVD, too . . . *sigh* . . . they should have offered the Eurythmics as alternative audio.  It isn't as if the disc is packed so full of special features that they couldn't stick on another audio file.  I know the whole story of director Radford's unhappiness with the Eurythmics soundtrack that was apparently forced on him way back when, but even the DVD release of Ridely Scott's Legend had both the Tangerine Dream and Jerry Goldsmith versions.<br />This is a lot like the recent Gumby DVD release by Rhino, which used some horrid 80's Casio-keyboard soundtracks instead of the original audio.  So I'm afraid you'll find this DVD a total disappointment, if you remember the original music with any fondness.  That great quirky feel which that music added is now replaced with a boring requiem of droning, droning, droning orchestra.  A shame, really.
B000063DFQ|4.0|In my opinion this album is the weakest out of the the first seven.  It has decent songs but some are just not up to Maiden's standards.<br />1. WHERE EAGLES DARE (8/10)<BR>This song is not bad and has some great vocal moments but there's better and worse here.  Its also too long.<br />2. REVELATIONS (9.5/10)<BR>Now this one's pretty good.  Its slower than other songs and has some great guitar parts.  Much more relaxing than most fast paced Maiden songs.<br />3.  FLIGHT OF ICARUS (10/10)<BR>Okay, this is much better.  This song is awesome.  The chorus has got to be one of the best by Maiden.<br />4. DIE WITH YOUR BOOTS ON (8/10)<BR>I don't like this song that much.  The chorus gets rather annoying after a while.<br />5. THE TROOPER (9.5/10)<BR>Has some nice guitars and vocals.  Classic song.<br />6. STILL LIFE (8.25/10)<BR>The intro to this song is wierd.  I like the vocals here, they sound eerie.<br />7. QUEST FOR FIRE (7.5/10)<BR>This song is boring, the lyrics are cheesy and stupid.<br />8. SUN AND STEEL (7.75/10)<BR>This one's not that great either.  The chorus ain't bad though.<br />9. TO TAME A LAND (8.5/10)<BR>This song definitley blows compared to other epic masterpieces in the '80s.  Is this suppose to compare to Hallowed Be Thy Name or Rime of the Ancient Mariner?  Otherwise its not that bad of a song.  Guitars are pretty good.<br />Well this album ain't that bad, its just there are better ones to get.  Its still better than anything in the '90s.
B0001GOH6Q|5.0|I unfortunately never got a chance to see this movie while it was playing at the movie theatres and it's a real bummer because \\"Big Fish\\" is a really amazingly well done movie and one of the greatest movies of 2003. I was lured into seeing this film after reading and hearing all of the great reviews that this film got and let me tell you, this movie deserves all of the great reviews that it gets. Another thing that also made me want to see this was that it was directed by Tim Burton, one of my all time favorite directors. In fact, even as high of expectations that I had, this movie surpassed even those.<br /> \\"Big Fish\\" is the tale of an elderly father named Edward Bloom. Edward and his son William have never really gotten along very well. Edward has told his son William about his eccentric and highly adventurous life during his younger years to his son when he was a child but William however found it to be too `fantasy-oriented' and wants to hear Edward's `real' story without resorting to talking like it's a `fantasy' world. After it turned into an argument the two became estranged for over three years but  Edward has fallen ill to a terminal illness and Will returns to see him and learn about his past. Flashing back into Edwards younger days, the movie showcases all of the fun not to mention outrageously adventurous things Edward did during his younger days.<br /> This movie is just absolutely amazing but it's also a mix of tears and laughter as it's one of the most bittersweet movies that I've ever watched. Tim Burton who usually showcased his trademark with his generally macabre natured movies completely takes a U-Turn and replaces the Halloween styles with a more southern classic atmosphere and he as a result breaks new ground in his career and it works almost perfectly.  Burton on a directing note, hits another home run right out of the park on this movie as well. The story is just stellar and brings out incredible depth to the father/son dynamic.<br /> The acting by the entire cast was absolutely stellar especially by Ewan McGregor as the young Edward Bloom and also by Albert Finney as the much older Edward. The movie plot is just fun and not to mention heartbreaking yet funny all at the same time. It will leave you happy yet wanting to cry at the same time. This movie is so much fun and so emotional that I literally did not want it to end. It's that Good!<br /> Quite frankly, this is one of the best movies of 2003 and I strongly recommend that you buy this DVD as soon as possible because it is worth the money and I plan on watching it at least 500 more times!acting by the entire cast was absolutely stellar especially by Ewan McGregor as the young Edward Bloom and also by Albert Finney as the much older Edward.

B000023VR6|5.0|After 9 years of waiting, this album hit the street in 2001 (hence the name) and proved that Dr. Dre could still rap. With amazing classics like &quot;The Watcher&quot;, &quot;Still D.R.E&quot;, &quot;Big Ego's&quot;, &quot;Forgot about Dre&quot;, &quot;The Next Episode&quot;, and a lot more, this CD truly has a lot of amazing songs.<br />Truly, this CD builds upon the original Chronic, a classic in it's own right. Snoop Dogg is still here with Dr. Dre, along with a bunch of new guy's like Eminem. But since The Chronic, Dr. Dre has gotten better. Chronic 2001 has fresher beats and better rhymes that will truly keep this album at the top of your shelf.<br />In conclusion, any true rap fan will want this classic. Dr. Dre is the father of rap and this CD shows it.
B000059XUT|5.0|This movie took me by storm when I saw it back in the summer of 1995 at the theatres and let me tell you, this movie is still one of the best computer animated movies of all time. In fact this movie shattered new grounds back in 1995 by not using drawing cel animation and instead this movie is the first of an unbroken chain of computer generated animated movies that has continued to date with &quot;Finding Nemo&quot;.<br /> The plot is absolutely joyful and stunningly original. The story revolves around the quiet family home of a quiet town where a boy owns numerous toys with his toddler sister. The toys however, are almost like beings of their own and are 'living' as well but stop 'moving' when the boy comes back into his room. However, a cowboy named Tim is the most popular 'toy' in the boys bedroom and is kept by the pillow almost every night until on his birthday, he gets a fancy astronaut toy named Buzz Lightyear who has many 'gizmos' and in time takes over the toy cowboys place as the most popular toy and Tim gets enormously jealous of this. However, after a botched attempt to remove Buzz, the cowboy himself along with Buzz end up in the hands of a punk teenager who takes joy in blowing up toys with firecrackers and or other means like burning, breaking, or smashing them and/or even taking them apart and re-assembling their parts to create 'mutant' toys and now the clock is ticking for Tim and Buzz to escape from the boys house before they end up being blown to molecules.<br /> This movie is absolutely fun and original even by 1995 standards. The computer generated special effects are innovative and unbelievable especially considereing the fact that this movie came out nearly a whole decade ago. The whole tone of the movie is just fun and charming and is for the entire family. Not only that but this was what put the then newcomers Pixas right into the front seat of movie animation and would be the start of an unbroken streak of excellent movies from this dynamite team.amite team.
B00009TB5G|5.0|The number of extras in this DVD in really stunning. They cover every aspect of the production from Gollum to settings to warriors of middle-earth. i bought this DVD as a natural and instinctive step on my way to complete my Tolkien collection. However I must say that the long string of adjectives in the DVD title is well-earned. Right from the packaging there is a sense of exclusivity that makes this a really good experience.<br />I also like the the extra scenes, and i wish they had put the faramir scenes in the movie to show the hidden virtue of his character. Some scenes don't really fit into the mood of the film, so i can understand why they were cut, but Peter Jackson's conceptualization of Middle-Earth is so stunning that i don't even mind.
B000059Z8M|5.0|The first Toy Story movie was absolutely amazing but the 1999 sequel however does the unthinkable by taking what was good about the first and building on it!<br /> Here, Tim and Buzz Lightyear are back in their owner's home but things go horribly awry when they are misplaced in a box and are picked up by a saleman who aims to sell it to a public museum and put it up for permanent display and it's up to Tim and Buzz to get themselves back home before it's too late.<br /> There are a lot of great things about this movie but they are too numerous to explain with this review. Go and get this movie as soon as possible! It's worth every penny!
0800177177|1.0|This film is so far off the book it can barely be called the same thing, and how they managed to incorporate the author's name in the title is beyond me.  Keanu Reeves is laughable trying to mimic a posh British accent, and the high amount of sex thrown in at any slow point (none of which occurs in the story) is enough to put you off entirely.  The performances are pablum, and even Anthony Hopkins, who has saved other movies in his time, could not pull this one out of the dung pile for me or anyone I know.  All I can say is thank God Coppola did The Godfather, because without that, where would he be with films like this?  There are much better Draculas out there, notably the original, silent German film Nosferatu, which actually FOLLOWS THE BOOK, a concept apparently lost on the makers of this film.

B00005JMUA|5.0|I can honestly say that Kill Bill Volume 2 is one of the finest cinematic achievements I have seen in a very long time.  I loved it!  Quentin Tarantino is one genius of a filmmaker, masterfully combining a plethora of genres to create something quite profound.  I laughed, cried, cringed and cheered during this film.  I loved it so much, in fact, that I saw it 4 times in the theater, it is the kind of powerhouse of a film that you can watch over and over and over and over again and never EVER get tired of.  This is my favorite movie of all time, and I HIGHLY RECOMMEND it to anyone who loves movies!  I guarantee that you will not be disappointed!
B000002RXS|5.0|As a singer myself I have to say that I am sick of this constant, unmusical and tasteless Callas-bashing. Callas' Carmen is her only complete recording of a mezzo-part. At a time when he middle was her greatest forte she was asked by numerous opera-houses to sing Carmen on stage. She always declined such offers, as did Ponselle when she was offered Eboli. (Although she did sing Carmen) Since Carmen doesn't lie high it isn't a problem for Callas, her middle being in fantastic shape in 1964. Her habanera is graceful, yet dangerous and alluring. She's a dark Carmen, not just a skirt-whirling girl. She's as Don Jos puts it a \\"she-devil\\". Callas spoke of this in her interviews with Lord Harewood, she had a lot of insight on the role, the novel and the music. Her segeduilla is charming and absolutely sexy. One cannot help but fall for her. The gypsy-song has wild temperament, imaginative colouring and incredible ardour. The duet with Jos is softer, more tender but nevertheless demanding. What is most impressive though is the shattering final duet where Callas portrays the annoyed, fredoom-seeking Carmen to perfection. Gedda sounds fascinating and dramatic as Don Jos and Pretre knows the score like no other. But there are many other great Carmens not to miss: Stevens, de los Angeles, Troyanos, Migenes and Baltsa are only the most prominent names on the list. Have fun listening!
6304602901|5.0|First there was TV's Barney Miller,then the short-lived Police Squad,and now the first of seven POLICE ACADEMY films. Steve Guttenberg,who appeared in DINER two years before this film,is Carey Mahoney,a parking lot attendant who is arrested following termination from his job. At the police station where he's booked he meets Larvell Jones(Michael Winslow) who himself has been arrested for disturbing the peace. Winslow is famous for vocal impersonations of objects in action. So Carey and Larvell join the Metropolitan Police Academy as an alternative to jail. Also joining are Eugene Tackleberry(the late David Graf) who's a gun-lover,Karen Thompson(Kim Cattrall) who becomes Carey's girlfriend,Moses Hightower(football great Bubba Smith) who's a florist,George Martin(Andrew Rubin) who pretends to be Latin to score with women,Doug Fackler(Bruce Mahler) who joins against his wife's wishes(she joins 2 sequels later against HIS wishes!),Kyle Blankes,a mean-spirited fella and his buddy Chad Copeland,also mean-spirited. Carey misbehaves as much as he can to get evicted,because he initially didn't want to join the PA. He later changes his mind. George Gaynes is Commandant Eric Lassard and George R. Robertson is Commissioner Henry Hurst. G.W. Bailey of TV's M*A*S*H,is lieutenant Thaddeus Harris,who with the help of Kyle and Chad,rids the academy of undesirables(\\"scumbuckets\\" as Lt. Harris calls them). Memorable scenes include Carey teaching Schwarzenegger-ish Hightower how to drive in Chad's car! The car is damaged and Chad and Kyle put the blame on Carey who dare him to \\"throw the first punch\\",since Carey was initially scheming to be evicted. Also part of the cast is Marion Ramsey as Laverne Hooks,a short,soft-spoken African-American woman. Take note of how in another scene,she gets loud and nasty towards a criminal(\\"DON'T MOVE,DIRTBAG!\\"). That quote would be used in the sequels as well. Leslie Easterbrook of TV's Laverne & Shirley is Seargent Callahan who along with Lt. Harris,trains the cadets. Another memorable scene is where a concealed hooker performs oral sex on Commandant Lassard while he stands behind a podium. Carey was co-concealed inside the podium,the hooker emerged,Carey remained,and Lassard thought Carey performed the sexual act! Also,Martin,in drag,sneaks into the girls' dormitory and is finally caught by Callahan,who removes his wig,brassiere and dress. This popular film was directed by Hugh Wilson,who'd subsequently direct THE FIRST WIVES CLUB. Guttenberg stuck around for PA2,3 and 4.

031286504X|4.0|As usual Matheson creates a story that was completely original for it's time. I've seen people say he copied other stories like Return of the Living Dead,,etc. etc. But they fail to realize that this story was written in 1958. There was nothing like it at the time. It's not so much of a vampire story as it is a story of humanity and loneliness.  The main character is the only survivor of a plague that turns people into vampires. He's the only human left  and he has to find ways of surviving while not going to far from his Shelter-Like home.  The story also proposes some interesting viewpoints on how the vampires were started.<br /><br />It's not really scary at all but haunting in that you feel a sense of doom for the main character. Really, How long can someone survive in an enviroment like that completely alone.<br />I gave it three stars because the story was actually written in the future from the original copywright,, 1976. Matheson didn't really attempt to forecast any changes in the world between 1958 and 1976. He pretty much assumed everything would be the same including cars being started with a ignition button and black people still being called Negroes.:)  Other than that it is a great and quick (178 pgs.) Novel.

1592400876|3.0|As an editor and part-time teacher--with a history of teaching English grammar at various times in my teaching life--I pre-ordered this book with great anticipation. I was disappointed, probably because my expectations were so high.  There are cute nuggets here and there, accurate and lively attempts at explaining punctuation rules. However, it is not quite as entertaining and engaging as I was led to believe it would be.  For most people, I'd rate it at 3 stars.  If you are an English teacher looking for ideas to inspire you into coming up with examples that will engage your students, I'd give it 4 stars.  It's cute and mildly amusing but could have been incisive and engaging.  I'll end on a strength: Truss does incorporate examples from the history of English, other languages, and  printing about which not everyone knows.
B00000JPYD|5.0|Many consider this to be Trowers finest hour. As for myself I might enjoy Trowers first, &quot;Twice Removed from Yesterday's&quot; spacey strecthed out Hendrix inspired &quot;Bold as Love&quot; peroid explorations a hair more, but &quot;Bridge of Sighs&quot; is Trowers most focused album. It is hard to argue with the sonic explosion that is &quot;Day of the Eagle,&quot; that starts this album. Just killer heavy duty blues/rock guitar turned up to eleven, then followed by one of Trowers finest heavy riffed spacey songs, the title song &quot;Bridge of Sighs.&quot; WOW! I remember hearing these two songs in tandem back in the 70's &amp; I was hooked for good. Trower is truely a master of his instrument, his thick tone, shimmering sustain, sense of melody, &amp; passion really come off as some of the heaviest most melodic guitar playing known to rock. Pigeoned holed as a Hendrix clone, Trower is much more than that. He is Hendrix's ace disciple easly rivaling his mentor's inspiration with this album, &amp; maybe even surpassing it.<br />The passionate singing of bassist Rob Dewar is an overlooked treasure on many of Trowers albums. Here on &quot;Lady Love&quot; Trower &amp; Dewar crescend in a seamless whole of sincere delicate axemenship &amp; impassioned singing to make it a listeners delight. On &quot;Too Rolling Stoned&quot; Dewar shows us he is able to thump the bass to Trowers rollicking leads &amp; riffs. Trower shows some of his funk on &quot;The Fool &amp; Me.&quot; Really there is not a clinker in this whole album, it's is a collection of flawless work from a master of his instrument. For lovers of killer Rock guitar!!!<br />***** Stars

B00005JMEW|4.0|Kill Bill<br />Quentin Tarantino has a unique ability to create violent films that combine almost Haiku like moments of extreme mayhem with cutting humor and drama.  The inevitable result is a viewer who sits magnetized for the duration and then must puzzle through a variety of simultaneous reactions to the film.  In 'Kill Bill,' starring Uma Thurman as an assassin dead set on revenge when her wedding is turned into a bloodbath, Tarantino not only lives up to all expectations but develops a whole new grammar in the process.<br />Both killers and 'The Bride' were once a deadly team (the Deadly Viper Assassination Squad) but broken apart by Thurman's desire to retire to a more normal life.  This is the first film in a series that will follow 'The Bride' as she takes on each of her tormentors, culminating in a final confrontation with Bill, their leader.  For this stanza her targets are Vivica Fox and Lucy Liu.<br />What sets the film apart is that it is conscious of its art.  While very much a lampoon of several genres (samurai, lady assassin, Yakuza, spaghetti western, etc.), Tarantino uses black and white as well as animation to set aspects of the story apart.  Experiment shot angles and sudden changes of scene also build the nervous energy that marks the entire film.  We shift from church to hospital to kitchen and back again like jumping jacks.  One moment we are in a nightclub full of whirling killers, and the next we are in a Zen garden in mid-winter.<br />The result is a visual extravaganza - sudden perfectly choreographed moments that whirl by almost to quickly to absorb.  The script is as terse as the visuals are complex.  This is physical acting, not narrative development.  Tarantino pays surprising attention to the musical work, both the scoring (flamenco samurai?) and the madcap gyrations of the 5, 6, 7, 8's who turn surfer music into a post-modern experience.<br />The violence, of course, is way over the top, even for Tarantino.  Revenge pushes all other considerations out of the way, and I can't think of any scene that someone won't find offensive.  In a sense, this is a harrowing look at aspects of our psyches that contradict our preferred view of ourselves.  Tarantino allows no space to be sacred or safe.  Even though the film has so much that is artistically right, one can't enjoy it without the sense that there is something terrible wrong as well.considerations out of the way, and I can't think of any scene that someone won't find offensive.

B0000CFW87|1.0|I think every mature music listener should avoid buying even listening this album.  From this point, I see the music industry is hopeless, When they see a dollar sign and they would just pull out this kind of young, naive, inmature singer into the commerical market.  Josh is only 20 something, barely received some instructions in formal music classes in a music school.  I listened to his cd once, and I couldnt tolerate and had to turn off my stereo because he has a 'FLAKE MICHAEL CRAWFORD' VOICE (JOSH'S VOICE SOUNDS VERY ANNOYING) and trying to commerically benefit from a reputable singer like CRAWFORD, TOO SAD.  SHOULDNT HE WAIT UNTIL HE GOT A DIPLOMA FROM HIS MUSIC SCHOOL??  We can also blame the executive producer of this cd, we know what DAVID FOSTER WANTS, WHEN HE SEE A DOLLAR SIGN $$$$  he could put anybody to the show biz, same deal with the CHICAGO (IT WAS A BIG MESS IN THE 80S ROCK-POP SCENE WHEN FOSTER PRODUCES STUFFS). Same deal with Michael Buble (However, Buble has something because he knows how to sing and reminds me of MEL TORME.                           <br />THE BOTTOM LINE: I CAN'T RECOMMEND THIS CD, AVOID
B0000A1RJI|1.0|While the music is enjoyable.  The CD itself is defective.  The sound during loud passages is very distorted.  It sounds as if the recording level was set too high.  I listened to the same parts on the DVD and the music was much clearer.  The soundtrack should be remastered and re-released (after the current soundtrack is recalled)
0451204530|5.0|Wow.  I couldn't put this book down.  When I read books like this, not only do I recall why I love to read, but I also remember why Follett's one of my favorite authors.  <br />Once again, Follett uses a real setting and occurence from history and works his story around it.  It gives the reader a better sense of immersion in the story as well as giving its characters a more beleivable air.  <br />I don't want to spoil the plot, but it has elements of the Borne Identity in it so for fans of that movie/book, this would definetly capture their interest.<br />This ranks right up there with my other favorites from Follett: Night Over Water, Dangerous Fortune, A Place Called Freedom...all of which are very close to Pillars of the Earth (the pinnacle of great storytelling in my opinion).<br />FANTASTIC!
B000002VCU|5.0|Gambling is a rather odd, albeit contemporary, topic for a collection of music.  The (near-)impossibility of winning, the addict, the desparate hope to improve one's position in life the easy way, the downside (i.e. the common one) of games of chance is a thread woven through the vocals with the possible exception of 'Time'.  A case can be made for its inclusion, but the excellent lyrics might support various themes.<br />It was probably included simply because it is so good.  It is without doubt one of Parsons best... ever.<br />Give this one a try.
0449227545|4.0|THis is a slight departure from Follett's other books. It's not about a particular event in history, it's not a spy novel.  To be honest, it reminds me of a James Patterson cat and mouse type of book from his earlier days.<br />As usual, i won't give away any plot points other than a cop you can't help rooting for and a villain who you hate (but can sympathize with) match whits in a battle of high stakes!<br />The method of crime employed by the villain is odd at first, but as the chapters go by, the characters and events suck the reader in pretty strongly.<br />Definetly worth checking out.
B000002UR7|2.0|Any of you true radiohead fans find this album unbearable, cliche of rock that you've been hearing for the past 5 years or so (which is why we love radiohead so much; they are so unique).  However, you have to notice that Pablo Honey was released in 1993.  Imagine a world of rock with Pearl Jam, Stone Temple Pilots, Nirvana, and then Radiohead's Pablo Honey.  Things are in perspective now, aren't they?  Although Pablo Honey is, in comparison to every other radiohead album, a true bore, it is at least worth acknowleging that it was way ahead of its time.
B000002J2F|5.0|I'm as fond of the B-3 and Mellotron as any good progger, but looking back on Duke, and listening to how updated technology influenced the band's sound, I still consider this one of the band's great albums. I do miss the Yamaha CP-70 of yesteryear!<br />Turn It On remains one of my all time favorite Genesis Hits, because while it is pop, it remains prog.  Many pop tunes sound like at least a handful of other songs, especially in today's world, but Turn it On keeps its uniqueness, and never grows stale.<br />You must listen to the entire album to appreciate its strength. I can't agree with those who say this album is a sellout at all.  There are too many wonderful, unique songs that sound like nothing else the band, nor other proggers have ever done.<br />This is the essence of Progressive Rock in my opinion.<br />OK - I admit it - Misunderstanding gives a musical nod to two earlier pop songs - &quot;Hot Sun in the Summertime&quot;, (artist not known to me), and &quot;Sail on Sailor&quot; by the Beach Boys, but the band never denied this, and while I didn't care for the tune when it first hit the charts, I wish today's best songs sounded as &quot;bad&quot; as this one.<br />Other gems on the album: Duchess, Man of Our Times, and the incredible Duke's Travels/Duke's End - some of the best licks Phil Collins and Tony Banks ever laid down on vinyl.  I haven't commented at all on Rutherford, and his presence is not felt on this one like other works, and musically he is no Hackett, but does a hell of a job keeping up with his bandmates with the guitars. He probably deserves more credit than I give him here.<br />The slower tunes, Heathaze, Alone Tonight, Please Don't Ask, and Guide Vocal are very introspective, somewhat sad looks into what was going on with the band's personal lives and get better with age.<br />Cul-De-Sac is not a bad song either, but it sounds to me like it belongs on their prior album,TWWT.<br />I don't know how true Genesis fans can say Duke is a sellout, and have anything good to say about Invisible Touch and We Cant Dance. Honestly.<br />Let's face it, the band had grown weary of their old sound, even if us real fans never do, and needed a little fresh air.  Then We Were Three is a foreshadowing of this, and Duke took this direction to new heights. Indeed, maybe Duke could be considered a transition album for the band, and one detects the continuation of this 'era' in some of Abacab. <br />I still live in a fantasy world that the band will get back together someday as have some of their contemporaries (Yes, Kansas, ELP, Crimson). Fat chance of this ever really happening.<br />This great band's demise and lack of desire and/or initiative to rejoin forces continues to perplex and dissapoint me.  I won't be buying any Phil Collins Disney soundtracks, or solo albums, nor Tony's classical albums any time soon.
B0000062GK|5.0|Do yourself a favor.  Buy this CD.  Put it in the player, cue up &quot;Time,&quot; lean back, shut your eyes, and listen.  Let your mind wander.  If this song doesn't take you away from this world, I don't know what will.  Every time I do this, I feel like I've gone through some kind of awakening.  And that's just one song out of 15.<br />I will freely admit that I am a rabid Satch fan, so I'm biased.  However, I will also freely admit that when I first bought this CD, I didn't much care for it.  I may have listened to it a couple of time, then it joined the CD collection and wasn't seen much.  After I saw Joe perform &quot;Time&quot; live, I went home and gave the CD a listen again, and realized what I'd been missing.<br />I will say without qualification that this is Joe's best work ever.  There's not even any point in trying to name my favorite tracks on the disc, because I'd end up with 3/4 of the songs listed.  Yes, it's really that good.  How often do you get a CD where you have no urge whatsoever to skip any tracks?  Where you make yourself late for work because you want to hear &quot;Secret Prayer?&quot;  There's something for everyone here, from straight-up rockers like &quot;Train of Angels&quot; and &quot;House Full of Bullets&quot;, to the powerful &quot;Love Thing,&quot; all the way to the pinnacle of Satch's atmospheric pieces, songs like &quot;With Jupiter in Mind&quot; and &quot;Lights of Heaven.&quot;<br />Worth every penny.
B000003S0D|5.0|Pour moi, ce disque rappelle le meilleur du dbut de l'poque du rock progressif, une de ses racines les plus profondes et originales  la fois, autant que le premier disque de King Crimson.
B0000AQS0F|5.0|LIke most people who watched Firefly I never saw it until it came out on DVD and I wanted to cry because I realized the show was over before it had ever gotten started. The plot, setting and character dialogue is sharp, witty, and way above par for a pilot season series. I honestly don't know why FOX cancelled it, but as a huge fan of Joss Whedon I will mourn the loss of this show. I recommend it it to anyone who enjoys sci-fi and intelligent humor.
B00003CXCT|5.0|I give this DVD five stars on the merit of the movies alone, they are classics, but unfortunetely George Lucas isn't making the classics availiable on DVD, this desicion is welcomed by some, loathed by others, and I'm afraid I agree with those angered by it, Lucas isn't giving us the actual movies, if he likes the revamped one's better than that's good for him, but couldn't he have done what Steven Speilberg did with E.T. and release the Classic Movie and the \\"Special Edition\\" on the same disc so that we may have the option of chosing wich one we want to see?<BR>Seems to me he's just being stubborn by forcing these modernized versions down our throats.
B0000YEEGM|5.0|This is one of the best dramas of all time.  Tom Cruise and Dustin Hoffman act out the performances of their careers.  Everything about the movie is funny, dramatic, and heartwarming.  Dustin Hoffman is definately an awesome actor.  He brings the authenticity of the disorder.  Tom Cruise is the perfect person to play the annoyed brother because he can make the biggest jerk sympathetic.  All in all this movie is great.  I highly reccomend it.
B0001V07ZQ|1.0|This film was perchance one of the worst I have ever had the displeasure of viewing. To begin with, the cinema at which I saw this film was filthy. Refuse and spilled drink were ubiquitous, rendering the floor sticky and thus completely abhorrent. The staff was terrible, and they all had a terrible attitude. Furthermore, the man who was selling the popcorn was a racist, and his relentless taunts will remain in my mind for the rest of my life. As for the film, it was quite enjoyable, and quite worthy of the Academy Award (TM) nomination it garnered. In summation, I would recommend this film to all those enjoy a film with a talented cast and wonderful direction; just don't see it at the Odeon in Leicester Square, London, UK, SW4.
0790732203|4.0|Tom Cruise really broke out in this film.  It is really un-brat pack which was good.  Teen movies needed to look outside the box after the numerous Brat Pack Movies.  In this Tom Cruise plays a good bad boy who sneeks behind his parents while they are away.  The movie is very unrealistic, but it really plays out every man's fantasy.  The acting is honest.  The plot is good.  The soundtrack is great, and it all combines to make a classic teen movie.  One of the best.  I reccomend it.
B000002URV|5.0|Back in 1990, while I was still working in radio, a program director who shall remain nameless demanded that I pull the single &quot;Sadeness&quot; off the air because he thought it was &quot;blasphemous.&quot; I was kind of dumbfounded, because I found it to be contemporary and original, and not in the least bit obscene. Just the kind of antidote to the blandness of the New Kids On The Block kiddy pop and dump truck loads of Whitney/Mariah clones being force fed to radio at the time. Of course, like any young buck worth his artistic salt, being told &quot;NO&quot; only made me want to find out more about this &quot;Enigma&quot; cat.<br />Once I got the full CD, I could understand how the easily shaken were getting their dander's flaked by Enigma. &quot;MCMXC A.D.&quot; was the first album that used the fresh idea of mixing new age keyboards with chanting Monks and giving them the kind of rhythm that would work as a slow grind on the dance floor -- or more important -- late night nasties in the bedroom. Then there was the &quot;Sadeness&quot; video, which pictured a rather religious looking fellow as he dreams/hallucinates about a sultry looking woman and beams of light. Yup - just the kind of thing to turn the album into a nocturnal classic, dance floor smash and a magnet for those prone to censor that which might ruffle their too fragile sensibilities.<br />Surprisingly (or not), the album holds up pretty well all these years later. Tidal waves of imitations flew up in &quot;MCMXC AD's&quot; wake, but none (save maybe Deep Forrest) ever made much of an impact. You can also probably blame/credit Enigma for making top sellers out of the Benedictine Monks of Santo Domingo de Silos (remember 1994's &quot;Chant&quot;?). With all that has been going on in music since, &quot;MCMXC AD&quot; seems almost quaint, but this album remains an artifact from the end of the new age decade. And it still gets played in my playroom.
B0000AQS0F|5.0|Firefly is perhaps one of the best shows I have seen in a long time. It has a very high fun-factor. I think anyone who watches the first few shows will have no doubt that it is, in fact, one of the best shows developed in the last few years.<P>I think the worst flaw in this series was the network's inability to properly market it or to anticipate the audience's needs/desires. Firefly was cancelled before I even heard of it. I can only attribute that failing to the network's lack of faith or direction in the audience and in the show itself - instead we are stuck with cookie cutter television shows that are a dime a dozen.<P>Once the background of the show is understood there is nothing but possibility for where this show can go. The characters are complex and give the ample opportunity for action packed adventures with an emotional edge.<P>Above all, Firefly is clever and smart. It hasn't been dumbed down into a brutish space-western adventure that lacks plot and substance. It has been a long time since a clever show, that doesn't fit the current industry mold, has aired. I fully believe that the networks had no idea how to promote the show to attract its core audience. As a result, the network blamed Firefly for its own failing, and has left Firefly and its audience to bear the brunt for the show's cancellation. <P>Perhaps if the networks were as clever as the writers Firefly would never have been cancelled. Alas, in the age of cookie cutter television what more can be expected?
B000002U6E|4.0|Enigma mesmerized everyone in 1990 when his/their debut became (we're all adults here, right?) a bedroom classic. He also took the music world by storm, and soon everyone from Deep Forrest to the Benedictine Monks were marking their territory with similar forays into new age and ambient music. Which meant that Michael Cretu was left with either trying to make &quot;Sadeness-ness&quot; or pushing his sounds in different directions.<br />To that end, he certainly did try! There's very little of the Gregorian sampling from the first album here, and in its place are explorations of Native American music and electric guitars. Not all of it works as well as the debut (those guitar solos in particular), but &quot;Return To Innocence&quot; is probably the best song he's ever come up with. Much like a modern day Alan Parsons Project, Michael Cretu builds songs like a sonic architect, layering images for effect, and on the opposite side, effects to evoke imagery.<br />In &quot;I Love You...I'll Kill You,&quot; the sounds come off as dangerous and slinky. Considering the song was originally used in a stinker of a stalker movie called &quot;Sliver,&quot; it fits. But the catcher is the song's final verse, where the voice whispers, &quot;I love you, I'll kill you, but I'll love you forever.&quot; Now THAT'S the kind of freakiness that got the first album noticed, and it's the closest &quot;Cross Of Changes&quot; gets to the brilliance of &quot;MCMXC A.D.&quot; (Though I could have lived without the rock guitar.)<br />While a pretty good album overall, I'd still recommend the debut first, and then &quot;Cross Of Changes.&quot; If you're looking for more of the bombastic songs from Enigma's career, I'd then suggest going with the &quot;L.S.D.&quot; hits collection, which skips the ambiance and concentrates more on popular selections.
B0001ZX0PG|5.0|This was the best movie of 2003. I do feel that Lord of the Rings was very good also, but this movie should have won best picture and best screenplay (adaptation). Lord of the Rings will be classic entertainment and will be to my kids what Star Wars was for me. However, this will be considered a classic work of art in cinema. Eastwood is right on the mark with this movie. The characters are devious and wonderful, tragic and beautiful. While the story is quite depressing and may not be everyone's cup of tea, you still cannot deny the quality of this film.
B00006BTCA|5.0|I do not know if that is a word but that describes this band.I dont have as large as knowledge of music as most of the reviewers here but I am a musician and i do believe that their song writing is of top knotch. I love every song on the cd and how each one has a different flavor to it. I never heard an original voice as the lead singer of this band in the past few years. That is mainly because you rarely get to hear any good music on the radio anymore. I think the day any of Radiohead songs that are not off of The Bends or Ok Computer are played on the radio hell will freeze over. Same with Sigour Ros(cant spell). But those bands all have something in common, they are all outside of the box. I really believe this is not the last we heard from Interpol by far. They are definately my new favorite band as of now. The last four cds i bought were Probot, Deftones - Around the Fur, D12 - D12 World, and Interpol - Turn on the Bright Lights. Out of all these excellent cds I will admit, over my favorite band for the past few years Deftones, that Interpol has been listened to the most. It is a cd that you need to get used to by listening to it more then once. It is a cd that grows on you, much like the past few Radiohead albums.
B0000DZ3IG|5.0|I loved this album so much I listened to it when I was in labour. Unfortunately my husband left it in the hospital CD player so I am buying it AGAIN!
B00014NE62|4.0|I write this specifically for british and Australian members of Amazon who may have bought \\"Maurice\\" in the el-cheapo full screen DVD version which has been around for the last twelve months or so. I was shocked when I bought this(at the ridiculous price of $Aus9.99)to see a faded print in full frame and not particularly good sound and no extras. This new American release is like another world. Glorious to look at and with a whole second disc of special features (including a whole section of the movie in deleted scenes that was removed from the final cut). The interviews with the three actors are informative and intelligent. Rupert Graves is certainly one of Britain's finest and he hardly looks any older!!(why???how???) The deleted scenes do reconstruct a rather confusing opening sequence with a plotline that would be exorcised from the final film and it is easy to see why.These scenes that have been cut are quite erotic at times. There is also a bedroom scene between James Wilby and Hugh Grant, which is not sexual, but underscores the drama of the piece beautifully. Surely the best film Merchant Ivory ever made, now in all its glory at last. Beware of the earlier DVD release and grab this one as fast as you can.
B0000D96NW|4.0|While I enjoyed the Burning Red it is nice to see them go back to what they are known for, straight up groovy bay area thrash with hints of melody.Machine Head have stepped to the plate and made the most devastating release since The More Things Change. Reccommened tracks, VIM,IMPERIUM,SEASONS WITHER,BITE THE BULLET AND WIPE THE TEARS.
0061020710|5.0|What do I think of this book? Look at the review title. What words are there for exactly how much I get into books like this? None. However, letters of contempt to the author concerning the ending. I read the guidelines and am not giving out any details, and I warn you, if you are afraid of things being given away about the plot, don't read any more about this review; move on, but still: drawn to the character or two in many books who is markedly an innocent for some reason or another, I was, well, prepared to rant on and on about it like mad for days upon learning that, in the very last five or so pages of the whole thing, that little Twoflower (omg I luv that little guy!)...er...has ferociously little chances of turning up in any of the other books (mutters this rather quickly). As a writer myself, I can tell that we can only imagine what writing that had to have been like for the author. Believe me, if you've been working with a set of characters for a couple hundred pages, you kinda get attatched to them after a while. But hey: he did it, and at least a couple people in the world totally freaked.<BR>However, there is something to be said for it all--it takes one freakishly good author to do something like that to us all. A terrible author would write a book that's so mind-numbingly dull, that the readers aren't interested in anyone in the story, and if someone leaves the plot, let's put it that way, no one really feels much of anything. But there are good authors out there, fortunately. For example, in J.R.R. Tolkien's &quot;The Two Towers&quot;, one might curiously thumb through the back pages of what we'll call THE SPIDER INCIDENT, and really, really, really get scared by the way it is all described. Think of all the arachnophobics in the world. But he thing is, one gets really into a story by an incredibly good author, and the true test of the author's worth is how the readers react when someone the've seen throughout the whole thing is unexpectedly &quot;letgo&quot;. The same goes for Douglas Adams's &quot;So Long, And Thanks For All The Fish&quot;. I'm not saying a word about what happens there, but throughout the third and fourth book, it is impossible not to wonder what in the world is going to happen to Marvin, my second favorite!! (Wowbagger the Infinitely Prolonged RULES THE HOUSE!)<BR>So, the only point I'm trying to get to here is that: one-if Twoflower shows up again by whatever means in the other 24 books, I plan to jump for joy despite Lemony Snicket's warnings and do the happy dance or something, and two-Pratchett is an obvious literary genius, and this is indisputably one of the best books I've ever read in my life. Kapeesh.
B00005LOLD|5.0|I was seven years old when this movie came out in 1957, but I had never heard of it until one day recently I accidentally caught the end of it on FLIX. I have since watched it over and over -- something I rarely do with any film. Others I have asked also had never heard of it.    This film is undeserving of such obscurity; it's a wonderful movie that just captivates me. But there's one scene in this film that is a high example of the filmmaker's art. This scene, in its perfection, is the most powerfully romantic movie scene I have ever beheld. Even after watching it many times, it still leaves me shaking! Wow! This scene transcends story telling with film; it is literature.        It evokes something from Madame Bovary (Gustave Flaubert), or Anna Karenina (Leo Tolstoy). That is to say, the scene portrays something vital about the human experience. At least it does for me; but then, I admit I'm a sucker for stories of love between American men and Asian women.        The scene to which I refer is when Lloyd Gruver (Marlon Brando) encounters Hana-ogi in Joe Kelly's (Red Buttons) house. It begins when he opens the sliding door and sees her kneeling, erect, serene, and dignified, waiting for him to arrive. If not on the first watching, then on the second, fourth, or eleventh watching, one will become aware that the lighting, the sound, the furnishings of the room, her hair, her kimonos, her makeup (especially her painted lips) are all perfect. What an ambiance! What a setting for a man and a woman to fall in love!       Gruver is immediately struck by her presence; this is plain to see. Nevertheless, he recovers his usual demeanor and proceeds to try to make small talk, his mind and body regarding this lovely creature with respect and admiration, but also lust. She just sits there, regarding him without moving, without even blinking, betraying no thoughts or emotions. His discomfort rises.        Then, when it is time and not before, she begins to speak. She speaks wordof deep humanity, compassion, wisdom, and sincerity. The power of her words is greatly enhanced by the quiet dignity with which she speaks them. Gruver is dumbfounded, and Brando plays this role very well. You can see on his face (Flaubert or Tolstoy would have painted the picture with words) that his life, unexpectedly, has just been bifurcated. There is now the life before this encounter, and what will come after. He can never again be the same man -- he can never again regard women the same; Hana-ogi is a new paradigm. He never looked for such a thing before, because he never imagined such a woman or such a feeling could exist.          Some people continue to insist such love themes are racist. That is absurd. It is the antithesis of racism. This is the profoundest love flourishing in spite of different races and cultures, and the inevitable perils incumbent with this relationship in this place at this time. This is love between a man and a woman, as unfettered by affectations and expectations as love can be. This is the raw, real thing, and this film tells this tale, exquisitely done.
B000002RXS|5.0|Well, what else can you expect from Maria Callas? She's always great! My favourite Carmen always!
B000002UUX|5.0|Blows my mind away each time I hear it. This album never gets old.  I know jazz and blues musicans that own this album and recommended me it because of the out-of-the-world guitar riffs.  In a class of its own.  You are not a metal fan if you do not own this album.  You may not even be a true guitar fan if you do not own this album!
B00005JM02|5.0|I should be tired of this movie since every day my 2 year old granddaughter comes over -every other day - the first thing sge does is get the Nemo box from my cabinet and bring it to me saying \\"Mamu Mamu Mamu\\" ( Nemo, Nemo, Nemo)<br />I can probably recite most of the dialog. However I never cease to enjoy the movie. It is a masterwork and improves with subsequent viewing - and I ought to know!<br />The graphics are astounding. The rich detail, the funny dialog and the life that Albert Brooks, Ellen Degeneris, and the rest including Willem Dafoe are the life of this movie.<br />The bonus material is fantastic and included on a second disk which also contains the halfscreen ( so called \\"full\\" screen) version with the ends chopped off.<br />I have this little rubber shark-topped floating thermometer in my pool. Caitlin calls him Bruce.<br />Oh yeah, the soundtrack in THX is awesome.<br />This is a magnificent acheivement. Bravo.<br />It may be supposed a kids movie but I love it.
B0000DZ3IG|5.0|Aa has been mentioned before, the Christmas songs are indeed on the album, just listed as bonus songs.  But they are there.  All around a super collection, would have liked to have the origonal or film version of &quot;All You Need is Love&quot; rather than this one but, everything else makes up for it!   I Love Eva Cassidy's &quot;Songbird&quot; and Joni Mitchell's &quot;Both Sides Now&quot;, they are both haunting tracks, absolutely excellent!
B0001Z53AQ|4.0|Very much worth it.  Alot of negativity floating around about it - and I'm not sure why.  Just like the Marshal Mathers LP - you have to ignore the hit song and listen to the rest of the CD.  There are some really great tracks on here.  Some are so-so and grow on you.  Others are hype from the start and just get better.  If you like Eminem, no reason not to grab this up to get more.  If you like Aftermath stuff, this is a good buy too.  Best group style rap in a long long time.  If there is less interest because its a group rather than a solo artist - thats a shame.  G Unit's Young Buck is great, both on the G Unit CD and on 50's.  Likewise, D12 has quite a few talented members and it won't surprise me if they do their own solos to drop the D12 pigeonholing.  Good stuff.
B0001XAS2G|4.0|From Scotland, Al Stewart became recognized in the US with the 1976 hit &quot;Year Of The Cat&quot; and continued his success with 1978's &quot;Time Passages&quot;, a truly overall light, mellow album with his trademark brainy lyrics, a light vocal delivery and a laid back, clean guitar style and texture. Produced wonderfully by the great Alan Parsons, this album delivered two simply superb, excellent gems that were FM staples at the time (&quot;Time Passages&quot; and &quot;Song On The Radio&quot;),a time where a nice, smooth excursion was needed from the late 70's disco craze. <br />Other highlights contain the cool under-water floating, personal-favorite &quot;Life In Dark Water&quot;, as well as the cerebral &quot;A Man For All Seasons&quot;, the just beautiful &quot;The Palace Of Versailles&quot; and &quot;Timeless Skies&quot; and the dreamy acoustic &quot;End Of The Day&quot;.<br />This newly remastered CD version breaths new sonic life into these pleasant songs. Definitely an excursion for your peace of mind.

0451191153|5.0|Analyzing &quot;The Fountainhead&quot; is like dissecting a frog. Very few people are interested and it kills the frog.<br />Regardless of what you think of Ayn Rand's then breakthrough ideas of capitalism, selfishness, etc., you must pick up this indubitable powerhouse of a novel.<br />The protagonist, Howard Roark, is quite conveniently a total orphan with no social moorings or responsibilities. This allows the author a great deal of liberty in weaving philosophical tropes around him.<br />The presentation of the ideas though is simply delicious, couched in some riveting writing, and will keep your thought mills running for a good while. I underline my books and The Fountainhead is almost entirely colored.<br />A must-read. Period.
B0001GF2DS|5.0|This is another great example of what a &quot;Special Edition&quot; should be , it takes its place along with others such as &quot;Alien Quadrilogy&quot;, and all the Tarantino Spec.Eds.<BR>    The packaging is heavy duty cardboard , giftbox with the title on the cover in raised lettering. On the inside we have a essay/introduction written by Roger Ebert put together in booklet form, and highlighted with close up images of our three Desperados. Further into this edition we find several well done minature theatre lobby posters in different nationalities. There is also a miniture print of the original soundtrack album cover( which I actually have had since I was about 9). <BR>  Of course the main attraction, is the film, the fully restored film. Fully restored not just to its original European length but to its original Rome Premere length. And the quality of this picture is fantastic, beautiful technicolor. The audio as well has been redone and this was no easy feat ( you can learn about the process from the featurette &quot; Re-constructing The GBU.).<BR>     This is as good video and audio as we will ever get of this groundbreaking, sweeping, operatic masterpiece. <BR>     There are also very well done featurettes on the making of GBU, which include extensive interviews with Clint, and Eli as well as Leone producer, Grimaldi, and dubbing expert Knox,a historical documentary on Siblys Campaign(which is where Sergio got the idea for the CivilWar portion of the story), and a very intresting and educational commentary track by film historian Richard Sheckel. <BR>     Round all this off with some deleted footage, and the original theatrical trailer and you pretty much have the ultimate edition. <BR>  Weather or not you already own the bare bones edition of this classic( which is a pretty good print), if you are a Leone fan this is a MUST HAVE!!<BR>  My hats off to MGM!!
B00004Z4SD|5.0|A film that showcases something that has been missing from films...decency.  THE STRAIGHT STORY also shows a peaceful, laidback, and beautiful America. David Lynch pulls back (way, way, back) from his bizarro world and tells a story (based on a true account) that is heartfelt without being a tearjerker.  Richard Farnsworth (perfectly cast and deserved his best actor nomination) plays Alvin Straight a geriatric in Iowa who decides to visit and reconcile with his estranged and ailing brother Lyle (Harry Dean Stanton) in Wisconsin.  His transportation of choice is a John Deere riding lawn mower with trailer in tow (because his eyes are too bad for driving a car and he doesn't trust the driver of a bus).  Along the way he meets up with kind folk who are sympathetic, non-judgemental yet curious, and helpful to Alvin's cause and journey. They too learn something. Also, the cinematography of the vast farming landescapes, small towns, and country backroads are some of the best parts of the movie.  The pacing of the film is breezy and low-key allowing the viewer to relax and &quot;ride&quot; along with Farnsworth/Alvin's experiences with no indication of surprises or harm to the character (except for a couple of occasions of the riding mower breaking down or stalling).  Overall, a film with the commentary of determination, a simple way of life, and that decency can still be a film's selling point.
B0000067L2|4.0|The music here is 5 stars - the best album by a great band.  Too many great songs to mention, most of which are well-described in other reviews.  I'll mention only &quot;Dance the Night Away&quot; because it's my favorite Cream song and it simply doesn't get the attention it deserves.  It's grand, powerful and haunting, with one of the best guitar-bass riffs ever, and gorgeous harmonic singing by Eric and Jack.  But the real purpose of this review is to caution would-be buyers about the poor quality of the remastering.  It is mushy, tinny and clangy, with very poor sonic definition, and that's why I've &quot;docked&quot; it one star.  I find myself going back to my old scratchy vinyl copy to really crank this up and appreciate the music, and there's just no excuse for that.  I can't recommend that you NOT buy this because it may be the best alternative available to you, but it is not a worthy production.  We (and Cream) would be better served by a new and better remastering.
B000002RXS|5.0|As a singer myself I have to say that I am sick of this constant, unmusical and tasteless Callas-bashing. Callas' Carmen is her only complete recording of a mezzo-part. At a time when he middle was her greatest forte she was asked by numerous opera-houses to sing Carmen on stage. She always declined such offers, as did Ponselle when she was offered Eboli. (Although she did sing Carmen) Since Carmen doesn't lie high it isn't a problem for Callas, her middle being in fantastic shape in 1964. Her habanera is graceful, yet dangerous and alluring. She's a dark Carmen, not just a skirt-whirling girl. She's as Don Jos puts it a \\"she-devil\\". Callas spoke of this in her interviews with Lord Harewood, she had a lot of insight on the role, the novel and the music. Her segeduilla is charming and absolutely sexy. One cannot help but fall for her. The gypsy-song has wild temperament, imaginative colouring and incredible ardour. The duet with Jos is softer, more tender but nevertheless demanding. What is most impressive though is the shattering final duet where Callas portrays the annoyed, fredoom-seeking Carmen to perfection. Gedda sounds fascinating and dramatic as Don Jos and Pretre knows the score like no other. But there are many other great Carmens not to miss: Stevens, de los Angeles, Troyanos, Migenes and Baltsa are only the most prominent names on the list. Have fun listening!
B0001Z53AQ|2.0|Man this cd sucked.  I have to admit tho, there were a few really good songs, but just a Few..thats the only reason Im givin it even 2 stars.  Most of the CD is a steamin pile of sh*t.  But then again this is D12.  What could you expect.  They wuldnt be sh*t if it wasnt for Eminem.  They shulda just made this an EP with about 5 songs.  And \\"My Band\\" SUCKS!!! Why does everyone like it...its terrible.  Its probly the worst song Eminem has ever made.  It just makes him look bad.  Im actually an Eminem fan, but he culda done without that song.  The only songs i liked on this cd were \\"Git Up\\", \\"6 In The Morning\\", \\"How Come\\", \\"Get My Gun\\", and \\"40 Oz\\".  \\"40 Oz\\" really stood out from the rest, and it was the first song I downloaded off the album, and i was surprised and thought it would be good.  But when I heard the rest...well Im glad I didnt actually buy it.  Just download those 5 songs I listed and maybe you'll like another one or 2.  But overall, 5 outta 21 songs  bein good is not cool.  They shulda just made an EP and I probly woulda given it a 5...o well....& Im Out Like That<br />~Phat Gat~
B000000W5L|5.0|It took me a few listens, but I will never get tired of this CD. If you don't like it at first, keep listening. The bad production, most notably, the somewhat distorted vocals, are annoying at first. But, if you listen to the CD a few times, the album's production grows on you. Each time that you listen to the cd, you are able to pick up on many subtle examples of brilliance by the band. Don't take my word for it. Listen to the CD and figure it out for yourself.
B00003CXCT|4.0|These DVD's won't be the special editions that were released in 1997.  Lucas has tinkered some more, and reworked the special editions.  These DVD's will be the special special edition version of the movies, and will more smoothly tie in with all that will be revealed in Episode III.  (...).<br />Now, I grew up with these movies.  Literally.  I was 2 when ESB came out.  These movies have seeped.  And I got to say, I don't see the big deal about Lucas messing around with the originals.  If you don't like the special editions, or these new special special editions, then DON'T WATCH THEM.  You can still buy the originals on VHS for cheap on eBay.  If you're one of those people who like to whine that VHS doesn't count anymore and you absolutely must own everything on DVD, well...what will you do when the next thing replaces DVD??  And then when the next thing replaces that??  The cycle will never end.  So just keep a special Star Wars VCR in the closet, whip it out every time you want to watch the originals, and stop whining about the special editions.  From one geek to another...just shut up already.  If you've grown up to be cynical and jaded about your lost youth, that's too bad.  I for one enjoy the fact that Lucas tinkers, and that there is nor ever will be a definitive Star Wars saga.
B000002UA5|4.0|This album represents a glimpse into the creative explosion that was brought on by the experimentation of the mid-to-late sixties.  Those who lived through, and were part of this era should be able to appreciate the excitement the Floyd created by trying new directions in music.  It is definitely not for everyone, but for those with open minds (and those who were part of this scene) it is a magnificent sonic feast.  If you get it, you get it!  For those who don't there is nothing wrong with the safer venues, such as Dark Side Of The Moon.  The great thing about music? - There is something for everyone.
B000000WJZ|5.0|Admittedly my foray into the world of the Smashing pumpkins has only come fairly recently.  But I was wisely advised to start my investigations into their music with this album, and it's very easy to see what all the fuss was about.  For a band that were threatening to implode, from internal anguish (`Corgan' suffering from depression, `Chamberlin' battling drug addiction, and `D'arcy' &amp; `Iha' suffering a relationship breakdown between each other). The band were to dig deep despite themselves and still able to deliver an album that not only delivered on the extremely promising debut \\"Gish\\", but comfortably surpassed it.<br />\\"Cherub Rock\\" builds with a gradual escalation of sound, with layers of sound applied, with dense guitar slowly gathering in stature, until Corgan's voice punctuates the instrumentation, with a precious, angst-ridden vocal....that is as emotional and Melancholic as prime era \\"Nirvana\\", it's a moving expressive, loud sound that although a anthem in its own right, proved to be a soaringly energizing track, which is not only one of the pumpkins finest ever moments, and for me became my defining Pumpkins track, but became one of the greatest songs amongst the Alternative Rock genre.<br />The pumpkins themselves seemingly have the ability to tread a fine line between Theatrical emotionally charged dense alt-rock, and bombastic riff driven widescreen epic sonic assaults.  But are able to change direction effortlessly and flesh out their considerable sound with more contemplative moments that feel interspersed with quieter sombre elaborate slower songs (\\"Mayonaise\\", \\"Spaceboy\\" &amp; \\"Luna\\" aptly demonstrate the Quiet/Loud song dynamic that the band are easily able to move through).  That not only show a band that can deliver a sound that sound unlike anyone else and uniquely theirs, but remain accessible for people outside the alt-rock, grunge genre to penetrate (many people I know that didn't embrace the genre, but picked up a copy of `Siamese Dream').  But irrespective of that, the pumpkins with always be best known for their fierce, explosive, dynamic wall of sound barrages, looping fierce guitar tracks, and highly charged ambitious, abrasive performances (and exceptional drumming).  And for an album that contains the almighty anthems of \\"Cherub Rock\\", \\"Today\\" &amp; \\"Rocket\\" with their rousing metallic riffs, self absorbed indulgent lyrical confessions, dynamic bass playing, and detailed arrangements.  Each listen to the album revealed a layer of depth...not only in the song writing, but also contained in the subtlety of composition of tracks, and thus never fails prey to repetition under close scrutiny, that deftly enabled the pumpkins to (largely) sidestep criticisms of being predominately focused on alienation.<br />For those that have arrived at the pumpkins several years later then everyone else (myself included), if you are considering making the purchase, it can't be stressed enough that this album and \\"Mellon Collie and the Infinite Sadness\\" are largely considered the two best albums that the pumpkins ever committed to disk.  But starting with this album for those completely new to the pumpkins....this would be a very wise decision indeed ......in plain words \\"exceptional\\".
B0000039PW|5.0|Who can compare this guy to any other rappers first of all.<BR>Where do u have an album with straight hardcore lyricism and hard beats that make u just wanna keep listening to the next song? Notorious BIG was one of the best rappers and this album is the one that made him so famous and all the songs on this album are classics and its some of his best work so i strongly advise getting this CD. Can 50cent or ja rule or any of todays rappers have this kind of ability or are they just trying to copy biggie and 2pacs gangstaness this is a true thrilla
B000002KE2|5.0|From the intro to &quot;Wheels of Confusion&quot; (originally written as a separate track, &quot;The Straightener&quot;) to the outro of &quot;Under the Sun&quot; (also written as a separate track, &quot;Every Day Comes and Goes&quot;), this fourth offering from Black Sabbath showed no signs, on release in 1972, of their talents fading. Although FX is a somewhat pointless one and a half minute track of strange noises, it is more than compensated for by the rolling thunder of Supernaut followed by Snowblind (what a riff!). Here also we have &quot;Changes&quot;, recently re-released with great success by Ozzy and his daughter Kelly. Maybe not as good as what preceeded it, but still deserving of five stars and worth getting for Supernaut/Snowblind alone (although most of the other tracks are great too, these shine).
B000002O5L|5.0|This CD will show how much Tom Petty is my favorite musician. This was my second Tom Petty CD (Greatest Hits was my first).

B000002UUX|5.0|It's hard to believe how someone can play the riffs in holy wars and sing along with it.I can barely move while playing those riffs.<BR>Any metal fan or a guitar player should get this album.Technicaly this is megadeth's and thrash metal's best release ever. Marty Friedman is an amazing guitar player. His solos are out of this world. It requires more than a human being to compose that solo in Tornado of Souls.If you are not into megadeth but appreciate albums like Master of Puppets, you'll love this album.Except for lucretia all the songs kick ass, my personal favourites are holy wars, tornado of souls and hangar 18.Don't have this album?go get it.
B0001HLVSC|4.0|Director Peter Weir delved deeply into the relationship between Captain Jack Aubrey and his crew as they embark on a cat and mouse game to capture or destroy the highly advanced French enemy frigate, Acheron. Russell Crowe's portrayal of Capt Jack Aubrey was finely tuned to create a brilliant tactician with wit, humor and intense leadership qualities with much humanity.  He was able to laugh with his men yet instill the highest standards of discipline and expected protocol to be followed to the tee.  The ship's doctor, a naturist and healer, does not understand the military mindset and understands even less the fine line between friendship and duty.  It's through their banter we come to understand the leadership-style and character of Capt Jack Aubrey.<br />The great plus of this movie resides in the extensive detail that is put into recreating a late 17th century era from both a Naval and Darwinian viewpoint.  Orders, protocol, uniforms, salutes, meals, canons and even choice language is very well depicted in this movie.  The actors make it seem as if their whole lives had been on that ship.  You really felt like you were part of that crew. Equally realistic is the doctor's fascination with the creatures of the Galapagos Islands, calling the animals by their scientific name and keeping a detailed diary of drawings.  <br />The director definitely wanted to highlight the emerging presence of modern science and how it could be challenging to centuries of tradition and values.  This is clearly paralleled in the doctor's and Capt Aubrey's distinct philosophies. But Weir is clever enough to resolve this by showing the two can co-exist and prove quite a powerful, if not necessary, combination.   <br />If you're expecting a movie with a lot of barking orders, swashbuckling and canon-fire in scene after scene, just all out action, then you could be mistaking this for Pirates of the Carribean or even Gladiator. This is very much a serious drama with engaging action sequencesbuilt into it, not the other way around. So it can be slightly off-putting, if not a bit boring.  <br />Nonetheless a worthwhile and insightful film.  I highly recommended.

B000007T2Z|5.0|With GY!BE, your either one of two different types of people. You will either become bored with their music from the start, write it off as artsy garbage, walk away and never pick them up again. OR you will be patient, look at the complete picture and enjoy their work. You should know that GY!BE doesn't play by the traditional rules of music. Your likely never going to see a standard album with 12 songs, each being 3-4 minutes long form GY!BE. Instead you will get 2 or 3 songs spanding 12 or so minutes. GY!BE take to their work like composers. Each track on their albums seems to have chapters with brief interludes that trek across varying sound scapes and emotions. The best song on this album is &quot;East Hastings&quot;. It may seem that it's just celtic music with a mad man in the background, but once the song gets going, buckle up. To fully appreciate GY!BE you need to be opened minded. GY!BE won't jump out at you and demand your attention with catchy hooks and simple lyrics ( there are no lyrics...heh) they simply make unique and inovative music and leave the rest up to you.
B00005AAFS|5.0|Rammstein's music is a breath of fresh air in a genre of music that has constantly tried to conform itself and repeat.  But appearntly the germans are really the masters of metal music, and Rammstein really proves this.  I began getting interested with german and Norwegian music with the band Dimmu Borgir, and now i find that the language is an intrigal part in the music itself.  The fact that the songs are all sung in thier native language will not detour you but intrigue you and make you want to sing along with the harsh lyrics.  The music itself is dark, heavy, very eerie and i think indeed very gothic.  The guitar style is heavy enough to knock you off your chair, the vocalist can make his voice low and dramitic without sounding overtried or corny like Slipknot, and the keyboards add the icing to the cake with their creepy keys.  One of my favorite songs on here would be 'Mutter,' a sad song about a man filled with hate who has no real mother. Another good hit is the song 'Ich will,' the fast paced metal stopmer laden with shouting crowds and awesome creepy keyboards that makes the song something that teenagers would gladly love to scare the hell out of thier parents with.  But then agian,  isnt scary something you would just expect from a group of ex-factory worker German headbangers clad with strap-on dildoes who like to set people on fire?

1592400876|4.0|I'm a stickler for grammar and enjoy finding grammatical errors, typos, and other funny goofs with the English language.<br />The book hasn't been in America very long and already it has reached the coveted bestseller lists, and this despite retaining its British syntax. In reading the introduction, I was pleased to find the publisher had decided not to change the UK spellings, phrases, and even punctuation rules in the American version of the book. Hurrah! It would have been a nice touch to add a note regarding the differences in the rules of American and British grammar.<br />A couple of problems do come with leaving the British intact, however. A sign mentioned in the book is racist in American English and should have been omitted. Also present is the word \\"fag,\\" harmless in Britain, but a prejudicial term in the US. Not everyone realizes this.<br />Writing this review is stressful knowing the punctuation is going to be checked with a magnifying glass, while I remain true to what I have been taught. Here's an example of where we disagree:<br />Rule eight in using apostrophe to indicate the plural of words such as do, don't, but, and and. In reviewing my entire library of grammar-related books, a majority indicate the apostrophe is not needed when the context is clear. Thus, use dos, don'ts, buts, ands, Bs, CDs, and so on. Use the apostrophe when minding your p's and q's and trying to remember to cross those t's.<br />Truss clearly explains the purpose of ellipses and [sic], two items that have confused writers and readers. Since this book has given me a renewed and refreshed outlook into punctuation, I'm on the lookout for more grammar gotchas.<br />Those hemming and hawing at this review and the thought of saving punctuation won't want to come within ten feet of this book. Someone asked me if this would make a good book for learning the grammar rules. No, not this one. This is more for people who know the rules and need a laugh. It's the 'fiction' of grammar more than a how-to.<br />The author does discuss how things should be done, but it has essay-style writing about grammar.

0385510438|1.0|I am a big John Grisham fan and have read all his books.  I think I only read them out of habit now because I have not enjoyed the last few.  This was one of the most boring books I have read in a long time.  I think John Grisham should take a few years off and then maybe he would be able to write like he did 10 years ago.  I plodded through this book hoping it would get better, not really caring about the characters and finding it very predictable.  It never did get better but it did end!

B0001ENY6M|5.0|I ran to buy this CD after seeing &quot;The Passion&quot; and I have nothing but an excellent rating for this soundtrack.<br />The music is haunting and wraps you in a cloak of inspiration. Perfect of meditating, praying, pondering life as well as relaxing after a long day. I personally find arabic type music breathtaking and many songs on this CD carry whispers of instruments that are not often heard on American CD's. You are able to envision biblical times, with harems and tribes and all that life offered even the tragedy and triumph of Christ. John Debney has orchestrated a masterful soundtrack that I highly recommend for those of you spiritually inclined.
B000148KK2|2.0|Regardless of genre, the music and lyrics of this album just aren't as interesting, fun, touching...  as other songs she's performed in the past. She also tries some different vocal stylings, and I think they tend to sound forced -- and they clash with her otherwise smooth style. It's not that she shouldn't do originals at all, she just needs better originals to do.
B0001HAISQ|5.0|This is the Peter Pan you've always wanted to see; you just never knew it could be done so beautifully.  <br />I admit to having read the book as a child.  Yes, I am one of those people who has *expectations* before I go see certain films that are based on books.  Usually, those films disappoint me, but in the case of Peter Pan (2003 version) I was delighted.  This Peter Pan truly captured the magical world of Neverland and the childlike spirit of the original story that I remember. <br /> It's hard to imagine that there's anybody in the English speaking world who doesn't know this story, but all the same, here's a summary of the plot:  three Victorian children telling stories of adventure in their nursery attract the attention of a magical, extraordinary boy - Peter Pan.  He's a runaway that somehow managed to find his way to a magical otherworld called Neverland, where he will never grow up and more or less rules as the chief of wild boys like himself.  His friend Tinkerbell, a fairy, gives him the ability to fly; but his great talents and cleverness are what makes him extraordinary.  Peter Pan decides to steal the children away to Neverland with him because he can't get enough of the girl's stories. Truthfully, there's a part of him that misses having a mother and in some way she represents a little of that to him and the other Wild Boys.  Unfortunately, his nemesis Captain Hook has plans of his own to steal the children and raise them as pirates.  So the tale is set up for a great deal of adventure and wonder as the wild boy tribe and all the other inhabitants of Neverland take on the pirates to determine who will rule in the end.<br />The special effects were flawless in this film.  The actors were all perfectly cast, especially Jason Isaacs as that impish King of the Wild Boys, Peter.  The art direction was just right for this story, a mixture of whimsy and delight.  I felt that the occasional narration by Vanessa Redgrave added a nice touch and really helpedto preserve the essence of the original story's subtle wit and charm. This version of Peter Pan will appeal to a wide age range, including older children and adults.  Definitely one to purchase for the home library, my fellow parents!<BR>-Andrea, aka Merribelle
B00003CXCT|1.0|I doubt anyone will listen, but here goes. I grew up on Star Wars. To me, this is sacred ground we're walking on here and Lucas is destroying it. I don't want to see Han shoot first, I don't want Jabba in the first movie, and I don't want CGI in the \\"classic\\" trilogy. You can't go back and repaint the mona lisa to make it better, why would you do this to such a classic piece of modern mythology. The worst part is this dvd doesn't even say SPECIAL EDITION on it. He's trying to erase all mention that an original even existed. Until Lucas wises up and releases the real version. I won't buy a single product from lucasfilm, which includes a ticket to the crapfest that Ep III is sure to be. I urge anyone who cares about classic star wars to do the same. Vote with your wallets and Lucas will have to listen.
B000002KOO|4.0|. . . Fleetwood Mac made a great album.  Peter Green's &quot;Oh Well&quot; is a bona fide rock classic, and Danny Kirwan's &quot;Coming My Way&quot; has a wonderful guitar sound.  The real gem of this recording, in my opinion, is Green's heartfelt &quot;Back In the Beginning&quot; track, which moves me.  This album is crying out for a high quality remaster.

I recommend experiencing both.<br />This movie is visually stunning with alot of work having been done to perfect the scenery so that the viewer is transported into a quaint little French Town. The musical score is upbeat and passionate which adds a special dimension to the film. <br />Johnny Depp does an excellent job as the gypsy drifter that is greeted with reserve and prejudice by the uptight townspeople. Juliette Binoche plays the single woman with child who blows into town with a wind and leaves it in stiches. She opens a chocolate shop and falls prey to the overly religious mayor of the town because she entices others to sin during lent. I have to say that my favorite character is played by Dame Judy Dench, she is the free spirit of the town refusing in all of her years to be programmed by the rest of the world. She indulges in the delicious chocolate despite being diabetic and scolded by doctors and her own daughter. The chocolate becomes its own character managing to magically cure all of the towns ills if they allow it to work its sweet way into their deepest desires. <br />A sweetly sinful indulgence indeed!!
0060925000|5.0|My love for this book is made all the more remarkable by the fact that it is not a style of book I would generally enjoy.  But the many characters involved are so wonderfully likable that you are drawn in almost despite yourself.  <br />Beautifully written, entertainingly driven and heart-achingly resolved, I can't imagine anyone regretting choosing to read this novel.
B0001Z53AQ|1.0|First of all I would like to remind everyone that rap isn't music, it is talking with a background DJ to it. D12's hit song &quot;My Band&quot; is a terrible song with no sense to it. Emeinem just randomly states random things and ocassionly makes up words. I have bought the eminem show because of the anti-bush lyrics. That is possibly the only album in which I heard lyrics made sense by him. The only reason I gave it a star is because I have to. Dont waste your money on this cRAP.
B000092ZYX|5.0|This is my first Radiohead CD and let me tell you that for a fan of electronica and other styles of this genre, I was slightly jolted by the sound of this very &quot;interesting&quot; group.  A co-worker of mine had mentioned Radiohead to me, and I had seen them several times in the record store, but never was interested enough to check them out.  Again, taking dares on new and innovative music as I'm known to do, and reading the outstanding reviews on this band, I decided, &quot;Oh, what the hell?&quot;  My initial reaction to the haunting and jagged vocals of Thom Yorke and the raw-organic sounds of the band itself was one of bewilderment.  I was like, &quot;What makes this band so special?&quot; Then I began to listen to the words and the music and it came to me that OK these guys kick @$$!  I haven't really listened to alot of alternative rock bands, or any of Radiohead's previous material to be able to make accurate comparisons.  Nor can I make declarations that Radiohead is &quot;The best rock band on the scene&quot;, but I do know good music when I hear it, and these guys have created it with awesome songs like &quot;Sit Down, Stand Up&quot;, &quot;Sail to the Moon&quot;, &quot;Where I End and You Begin&quot;, &quot;There There&quot;, &quot;We Suck Young Blood&quot;, &quot;A Punchup at a Wedding&quot;, &quot;Myxomatosis&quot; and &quot;A Wolf at the Door&quot;.  I've ordered all of Radiohead's other stuff from a certain music service, basically sight &quot;unheard&quot;. I'm sure I'll be as equally impressed by these CDs as I am by &quot;Hail to the Thief&quot;, A true masterpiece!
B00005JMFQ|5.0|This movie comes as advertised---it's a feel-good movie about love and the fact that is is &quot;all around&quot; wherever you look, not just in the movies or in novels.  It's one of those movies that has about 10 different storylines going on in a large community of people, loosely connected to one another.  Each story is unique and entertaining.  The movie is long...over two hours, but if you like it, there's more than a half hour of deleted scenes, with director commentary, provided on the DVD version.  I watched the whole thing.  There is a great cast in this movie and the message is very simple...love exists if you just look around you and are willing to see it.  This movie leaves you with the feeling that you are going to fall in love tomorrow!
6304806426|5.0|I can't even count how many times I have seen this movie. Each time I watch it I cry for days. A visually beautiful film with a tragic story line that involves war, political conspiracy, a haunting love story and wonderful characters of great depth.<br />This is one of my all time favorite films and top five love stories. It is breathtakingly beautiful and powerfully tragic at the same time. Worth every moment!!
B0001RVTXO|4.0|This is a fairly solid album and is very well done. BUT if you have Death to the Pixies than this album has little to add. A few tracks are notable such as &quot;Winter Long&quot; and &quot;Into the white&quot; Also some of the single versions are interesting to listen to, but not worth buying again for many repeated tracks. Instead of buying this, buy Death To The Pixies and go download Winter Long and Into the white of iTunes or something.
B000000OAL|3.0|In 1973, a few friends and acquaintances got together who had already been in a couple of bands, and had already kind of got their faces semi-known on the gig circuit. These bands were called 'Smile' and 'Larry Lurex.' Brian May and Roger Taylor were in Smile, and Frederick Bulsara, also known as Freddie Mercury, was in Larry Lurex. When these young up and coming musicians got together, along with John Deacon, little did they know they were creating musical history....<br />So we are all familiar with Queen, i'm sure every single one of us knows the words to at least one Queen song, and i'm sure we all headbang when the heavy bit of Bohemian Rhapsody comes on, thanks to Waynes World! But the very first couple of Queen albums, don't really contain any of their hits, and are reasonably under-heard. On this, their debut album, they were still finding their feet, and hadn't really developed much of their trademark styles. For instance, Freddie Mercury's vocals weren't quite as operatic as they would later become, and Brian May's guitar didn't fully sound like, well, Brian May's guitar! But this album does contain little signs that they were about to become great.<br />The album starts with 'Keep yourself alive', which is a great fast paced intro to the album, and my favourite track here. May's guitar riffs are brilliantly played, and Taylor's drumming is in top form. A great anthem.<BR>The next track 'Doing alright' changes speed and sound quite drastically, more of a ballad. Although it does break into a heavy rock solo in the middle, before going back to its chilled sound to end the song.<BR>'Great king rat' follows, and along with 'My fairy king', provides a fantasy playground for Mercury's lyrics, which thinking of the Queen we know and love, doesn't seem to fit too well in my eyes. The music is good, and the musicianship is still top quality, but the lyrics seem to be a little far fetched. <BR>The next track 'Liar', is a good song, albeit a little repetitive, but still rocks, whilst 'The night comes down' once again changes the pace and the feel of the album, forgetting the fantasy characters, and giving us a good old ballad style song. <BR>Roger Taylor takes over lead vocal duties on 'Modern times rock n roll', and this is a short, snappy rock song, coming in at under 2 minutes. Very good though, despite being short, great pace.<BR>The next track 'Son and Daughter' contains a heavy metal riff that Black Sabbath would be proud of, easily the heaviest sound on the album, a great tune indeed. Second best here i think.<BR>'Jesus' follows, and this is just a little too religious and tacky for my liking, with lyrics such as 'they followed a star took them to Bethlehem.' Now i'm not anti-religion, but i just don't really like religious songs, so this doesn't do it for me. <BR>The album ends with a short instrumental version of 'Seven seas of rhye', which is a nice little end to the album, but you kinda keep expecting the vocals to kick in if you've heard the version off 'Greatest hits'.<br />So, a mixed bag in my opinion, but a mixed bag with some greatness. A little rock, a little metal, a little balladery, some fantasy and great musicianship throughout. The seed which had been planted on this album, was to continue to grow and flourish, and would still be growing some 30 odd years later. Long live Queen!!
B0001Z53C4|5.0|This CD proves D12 can hold their own and not hang from eminem's coat tail (not that they ever did)
630463949X|5.0|It's an awesome concert filled with emotion and great sound.  The crowd was into the concert even though it was done in a soundstage and they even added to the already well performed live concert.  The song Silver Springs which failed to make the cut on Rumours (big mistake) had never been heard by any of people there in the way that she sang it.  They were on their feet by the end and now I hear her new version of the song on the radio regularly.  This was a major turning point for a band on an endeavor to reach out to each other and perform again.  It's really a very special DVD.
B0001611DI|4.0|The second film in George Romero's cult zombie classics is &quot;Dawn of the Dead&quot;. We are transported to the after affects of the zombie invasion from the first film &quot;Night of the Living Dead&quot; and see that chaos has taken over where order no longer exists. <br />The zombies become target practice for rednecks and society loses its grip. From this chaos a few escape by helicopter, a couple of SWAT guys (one black of course!), a wimpy nerd who oozes fear, his feeble girlfriend, and you know the rest.....So these people take over a shopping mall and have a blast living in free luxury until the zombies figure out a way into their secure compound. Then all hell breaks loose!!<br />Sometimes comical, gruesome and even remotely possible (without the zombies of course), this movie captures the essense of what drives Americans, control, survival, material possesions, freedom, democracy and FEAR!! Look for all the nuances and don't be surprised what you find. Romero is known for his political understatements. This is a must for all you fellow zombie fans...so cuddle up and scream!!
B00005JMEW|5.0|Really.  Watch this, then watch anything else.  How do you feel?  This is not a student film (Mike Moore) or a piece of s*** (most films).  Nothing is sacrificed for your benefit.  When The Bride opens the paper walls of The Blue Lotus and enters the pristine snowstorm . . .there is no more powerful visual piece in popular film and not even a close one since Close Encounters.  People suffering?  Overdone.  Plot twists?  Overdone.  Let any other director even TRY to direct a film where the ultimate outcome is revealed in the title.<br />Not since AIRPLANE has a genre been so perfectly lampooned and improved in the same film.
0446530573|5.0|These recipes are SO easy to make,and SO good!Fuggedabout any other Italian cookbook,this one has it ALL!<BR>I have made just about everything in it,and all my family loves when I cook!<BR>Just had the Fettucine Primavera tonight,and it was outstanding!!!<BR>Thanks to Artie Bucco and the writers for putting this together!<BR>Hopefully Sopranos Cookbook #2 will be out soon!!!!
B00005JKJA|5.0|I have hesitated to write a review of this film for several years now.  The chief reason for this is that &quot;Mulholland Drive&quot; is my favorite film ever, and I despaired of ever getting the proper emotional distance required to review the film.<br />However, it has now been several months since I've had a chance to see the film, and I think its strengths and weaknesses have settled fairly well in my memory.  This film is quite simply a triumph of expert filmmaking.  I will admit that David Lynch's record was spotty up to this point.  I found &quot;Blue Velvet&quot; captivating but thought &quot;Eraserhead&quot; was too deliberately misanthropic and offputting.  But Lynch has finally found the right idiom and plot for his unique style of filmmaking.<br />The first strength you notice about this film is that it is positively dripping with atmosphere.  Lynch's strong use of color drenches every frame in a wash of film-noir paranoia; it is obvious just from looking at the screen that something is not right here.  Fabrics and wallpaper are just never THAT bright; foliage and jewelry leaps off the screen with its vividness.  The film's second strength is incredible acting, particularly from Naomi Watts.  Her failure to receive an Academy Award for this performance was the beginning of my current distrust for the Academy's choices.  Watts is here required to play two different roles, one vastly different from the other.  It is a feat she accomplishes flawlessly, shifting from one character to the other so completely that at first I didn't realize it was the same actress playing both roles.  Laura Harring lends capable support, her face and acting style a throwback to a thirties melodrama.  It is only appropriate that she chooses her character's name from a Rita Hayworth poster.<br />And now, for what I consider to be the final strength, but what some will call the first weakness: the plot.  (I will attempt not to spoil the film for those who haven't seen it.)  The plot is what has caused this to be a hotly-debated film among my fellow film junkies.  There are numerous ways of interpreting the plot, but you'll have to watch the film at least twice to get a grasp on anything that's going on.  As the film opens, we meet Betty (Watts), a Canadian fresh off the plane to become a famous Hollywood actress.  Meanwhile, Rita (Harring) escapes an attempted assassination and a car crash with amnesia but no physical injuries and wanders into the apartment where Betty is staying.  Once Betty gets over the shock of finding Rita in her apartment, she decides to play detective and help Rita find out who's after her and why.  After a few scenes of typical movie detective work, the film takes a 180-degree turn and you are forced to question whether any of what you've just seen even happened.  Wound into this complex plot are threads dealing with an uber-hip movie director, a sinister cowboy, a dreadlocked monster living behind a tacky diner, and a film whose casting is directly controlled from above by a Mafia midget.  (Hey, it's a Lynch film; you knew the midget had to turn up eventually!)<br />The film is not easy to follow.  As I mentioned, it requires multiple viewings before sense can be hammered out of the film.  The list of plot elements above will give you a fairly good idea of how eclectic and challenging this film is.  It is also disturbing, with themes and occasional images of death abounding. Lynch has made a serious movie for people who are serious about their movies, and therein I believe lies the reason why so many are put off by this film.  Although I love it dearly, it is probably one of the least purely entertaining films I have ever seen.  The first few times you see it, you will be hunched beside the screen with a furrowed brow, piecing it all together.  It becomes more entertaining once you have your interpretation of the events and can simply sit back and watch.  It is not a film that will make you relax.  It will quite possibly disturb you.  It is a powerful film.  And yet, if you let it, it can be the most rewarding viewing experience you will have.possibly disturb you.  It is a powerful film.  And yet, if you let it, it can be the most rewarding viewing experience you will have.
014100018X|5.0|I watched the movie &quot;Chocolat&quot; a year or so ago and found myself amazed at the sensuality of this little story. So I decided to read the book although I felt I knew the story.<br />Joanne Harris is a brilliant story teller with such admiration for the senses that she pulls her readers into a land of sensory overload where you want to reside forever. The book is different than the movie (isn't this always the case?) but just as entertaining. The delicate prose and romantic verse keep you interested until the very end and then for days and days afterwards. I dare you to read this tale and not find yourself sipping wine and cocoa while being tempted by all the chocolate. France will be calling your name!
B0001VWP8I|5.0|Anastacia has done another excellent job. This album is defined as soul, rock and pop all in one. The passion and conviction in her voice can be felt down to the bone. Having overcome cancer, Anastacia also did a \\"Diary\\" to accompany the CD. One can only appreciate the lyrics and the voice after hearing that \\"Diary\\". It gives us all inspiration to always try to take good out of something unfortunate. For Anastacia, that was bringing awareness to an issue: breast cancer for young women. \\"Left Outside Alone\\" is a great example of how her conviction comes out in song. \\"Sick & Tired\\", \\"I Do\\", \\"Heavy on My Heart\\", \\"Where Do I Belong\\" are all excellent. The remixes have been released as well for \\"Left Outside Alone\\" by Jason Nevins & Glenn Friscia - definitely worth checking out - they do a great job to this already awesome tune.  Anastacia should be nominated for a grammy - and take it home. This is the best album I've heard in terms of song, lyric and voice in probably five years. Anastacia is a fighter and her determination is shown in this masterpiece.  highly recommend.  5+ Stars. You have to hear it to believe it.
B000089RVX|5.0|this cd is worth the money.<BR>it has passion and it has lyrics that pull you in. the first time i heard one of their songs was in the bg of an online journal at [...] , i fell in love with that song. this cd is worth it.
B0000DZEE3|4.0|I've always like RHCP but just started getting into it after the greatest hits album.  I picked up the DVD and was happy with some Frusciante and Flea solos.  They have great chemistry and are definately top-notch in the industry and it shows on the DVD.  However, I was a little bit disappointed with the supposed DTS sound.  I have numerous music DVD's from similar large venues that are of far superior quality.  I wasn't picking up nearly enough bass and the vocals seemed a little muted, telling me that the recording just wasn't great.  I would have also liked some longer jams with the quality of musicians that they are.  Overall though, it is an enjoyable experience.
0062502182|5.0|I have heard of &quot;The Alchemist&quot; for years but I suppose I wasn't ready for its message until recently.<br />I honestly feel this book should be required reading for all people. Coelho has an amazing way of writing fiction with a theory about reality, and it works. He gives us the tale of a young boy disenchanted with his life who decides he must search the world for an answer to the hole in his heart. We are taken on a journey from Spain to Egypt with young Santaigo. Along the way we, like Santaigo, keep thinking that we have found life's answers but in the end we discover we had the answers all along. This is a profound discovery for some and a comforting redirection for others.<br />Paulo Coehlo writes with such a depth that I found myself taking quotes on almost every page for future inspiration on how to run my life. With all of the global issues taking place in the world today I was floored by the following quote, &quot;No matter what he does, every person on earth plays a central role in the history of the world. And normally he dosen't know it.&quot; In one paragraph Coehlo offers the answer. If we all felt so important we wouldn't need unnecessary attention would we? And maybe, just maybe the world would start to change.<br />The most important message to take from this wonderful time honored tale is this, &quot;Where your treasure is, there also will be your heart.&quot; Enough said!
B000089RVR|2.0|I only have webtv and not a computer.The sound clips I've heard from different companies(AMAZON INCLUDED) are SO BRIEF,I really don't get to hear enough of the song to rate it.I realize you can't play the WHOLE THING!,but you could play ONE MINUTE where I could really hear enough to actually RATE the song.I WILL say AMAZON'S sound quality is better than most but they are JUST AS STINGY as all the others!What FEW seconds I heard were good I guess but it wasn't nearly LONG ENOUGH...SHAME ON YOU! My rating of 2 stars is for it's briefness.I'm sure if I could hear ENOUGH,it would have been a 5!
B000069CWE|4.0|this is a very excellent cd and there are a lot of songs infact on here that i like, but there are some songs that just don't outweight the greatness of the originals. but this is a very excellent peice of work. but for those who are on more of the hip hop side will probably like it a lot more than the rock fans ^_^.
B000002BE9|5.0|Now this is some truly, honest to God gorgeous music, you can just relax to it and let it take you away. Fiona A. is one talented woman, and quite sensual in her songs. Although I love Tori Amos myself, Fiona's music is very different despite some similarities (a.k.a piano, having been raped)<br />High Points: I'm in LOVE with her sound, it is very unique in my opinion and has a dreamy, moody quality to it. Her voice is also awesome, it can sweep down deep and sultry and then soar high and sweet (wish there was more singers like that). AND not ONE song is bad (although I usually skip Pale September and Carrion for some reason). Favorite songs are Sullen Girl (the piano is beautiful and the lyrics are my favorite out of all the songs &quot;but he washed me shore and he took my pearl, and left an empty...shell, of me.&quot;), The First Taste (this really would be great to dance to, the vibe is awesome and her voice just glides through it), Slow Like Honey (sooooo seductive, Fiona tells why her man can't resist her.)<br />Low Points: Hmm...can't think of any haha! This whole album stays pretty consistent in feeling and sound, but if you have no patience for slow songs than you had best stay away.<br />This piece is really a stand out to me, and I wish there was more music out like this, in fact, I think we need it. To get away from having to be all edgy and beautiful and pumped up... and just chill. Yeah, that would be cool.
B0000CABK8|3.0|Well, for all you all or nothing at all people reviewing previously, I have to wonder; what's so special about a special edition?  I like the little trivia nuggets &amp; easter eggs, I like the extra features, but in my experience a special edition or directors cut usually changes the movie in such as a way that it loses its magic.  What I see on the screen I like to see on my telly; most often adding footage and scenes just ruins the rythm &amp; doesn't improve the story.  Now, including the scenes in the bonus features, or having some way for the scenes to be re-integrated if you so choose when you play the film, that'd be swell!<br />These are movies, they're some of them special editions, director's editions, some are not.  Take ST:TMP for instance.  a quarter hour, 900 extra seconds of voyaging through V'ger.  Some folks called this first Trek film &quot;Star Trek: The Motionless Picture&quot;.  Can you imagine what an extra 12 minutes without dialogue does?  780 seconds of actors pretending to be awed, overwhelmed, impressed?  Even for an old school original issue Trekkie (YES! That's the *proper* definition for the fans who got the first space shuttle named Enterprise!) it's too much to bear.  It's like an intermission.  Rent a special edition before you buy it, lest you be saddled with a disappointing re-rendering of the film you enjoyed.
0446677450|5.0|This book was a joy to read. Robert Kiyosaki defines the things <BR>that keep people from getting rich, and he tells us how to think like and become rich people. It was alot of good general information aobut how to increase your financial intelligence. He even goes into some of the psychology behind poverty and wealth. I'm a beginner when it comes to financial literacy, and I found this book to be a goldmine of information.
B00004Z459|5.0|the passion of what they want to say is contageous. this really is a cd worth while. it's art, and best of all it's not britney...<br />it has heart.
0140177396|4.0|Continuing on from my last review...<BR>Personally, I'm glad that my English teacher (thanks Ms. Farvour)made us read Of Mice And Men because it taught me, and probably my fellow students, about what life was like sixty, seventy years ago, and what people had to go through just to get and maintain and job, if they could even get one. I think that Steinback does a nice job of writing about how life wasn't only hard for white Americans, but also how life was difficult for African Americans. Racism...you've probably heard the word before, but, unless you've even experienced it, you don't really know what it is...well...John writes about it in this book, and I'm glad he did. Steinbeck describes (not always in a nice manner...if you know what I mean...language)what kind of abuse, both verbally and physically, Crooks (the African American &quot;stable buck&quot;) is put through, and, although it was kind of hard to read sometimes, he wrote about the truth. Racism has been, and still is a major problem in America, and it is still a humungous (don't mind my spelling of that word) Social Issue.<BR>Well...all in all, as if I haven't said this enough, I think that author John Steinbeck wrote a good good book, and I encourage you to, at one point or another in your life, pick up this book and read it. It may not involve alot of action, or adventure, or mystery, but, it does involve reality, and it well teach you alot about history.<br />Sincerley Always,<BR>          Elizabeth H.
B000002RXS|5.0|All this controversy about one of the greatest singers that ever lived is really amusing. When I heard her singing this I thought she was made to sing Carmen. This dark, seductive voice is perfect for the sexy gypsy. And Gedda, Giuot and Massard are absolutely amazing in their roles. Pretre conducts with fire, the sound is awesome. In one word: Essential!
0783226063|5.0|NOTE WELL: As other reviewers have noted, you MUST avoid the t.v. version. It is AWFUL. Now:<br />Dune is gorgeous, stunning, grand, ingenious, bizarre. If you wish to be transported through time and space, you can do no better.<br />The use of the slightly silly weirding modules is perhaps the only significant drawback, serving as a convenient plot device. Brian Eno's score is compromised by Toto's &quot;triumphant '80s guitar&quot; (ick!) contribution. Beyond these minor points of inferiority, this movie is one of the most captivating cinematic experiences ever devised. And it is long. You must sit quietly!
B00006FDCD|4.0|From the the Guy, that brought you Sleep Walker, Carrie, Pet Sementary comes it.  A hooror gore movie about an evil demon that has been plague a little town for about 300 years cause death and destuction.  Every Twenth years the clown awakens to kill and feed.<br />To feed it has to take on  some time of solid form.  Lots of gore tons of suspense  and scary in the first half.  In the second half of the movie it gets a little chessy it has some stupid lines.<br />I saw this movie  on Tv when I was in my late tens. Had I seen it when I was in my early teen.  It would have scared the crap out of me  and I would have nightmare for  months.  Instead I only had them for three days.  I higly recomend unlesh  you are 1 14 or older you do not watch this movie.  For it might be to intense for you to handle.<br />If you like I also recommend Carrie, Carrie 2 the rage  Sleepwalker Some Times They Come Back and Sometime they Come Back Again.
B000002UYZ|4.0|Eleanor Rigby &amp; Yellow Submarine are not indicative of the masterpiece that is Revolver; Rubber Soul is a great album, but why is 50% of it included here at the expense of some other great stuff ? A bit unbalanced if you ask me, a bit like the stereo mixes of some of the other tracks. Still, it is the Beatles after all, so 4 stars from me...
B00003CXCT|2.0|Why, o why can't Lucas film just put on dvd the films as they were originaly realised.The special effect that use CGI in this film are not of top quality. Plus even with the best CGI shots you can't carry the illusion of reality for very long. Look at the LOTR films, yes they have CGI but they also use extensive models, simple camera tricks and they work infinitly better than any of the added garbage you will find in this new versions.When there finished Killing the franchise maybe they will listen to the fans.
0060930187|5.0|a book portraying Plath's life. <BR>Really emotionnal and full of passion.<BR>A book to enjoy to read even though it is not an ironic book. It so interesting!
B0000AGWJ7|5.0|....errrr...play that song...again? Well, Waking the Fallen, the current cd by Avenged Sevenfold is just breathtaking to say the least. Talented band, talented singer, emo, thrash, hardcore, melodic death (believe me, there's a difference between hardcore with melody and death with melody), solos, crunchy riffs, what else can you want? The Reverend (drummer) is great, he's fast and fairly technical, the bass is 'bass-ic'(ignore bad humour), but can be heard, contrary to popular belief. In fact most bassists can be heard, but I think you need to have played with bassists to know what you're actually listening for, as it's quite common people can't hear good bass.<br />The guitarists are awesome and are both very talented, Synyster Gates' solos kick and Zacky Vengeance is equally as good. All the riffs are awesome, ranging from thrash to melodic death. Awesome tone on the guitars.<BR>Matt Shadows has to be one of the best vocalists in metal, probably sharing the throne only with Howard Jones (KsE). Matt's voice is awesome, he can sing so well, just listen to I Won't See You Tonight Part 1, Chapter Four and basically everything on the album. His growling is fair, nothing special, but his screams are just awesome, very hardcore and ranging from a high(er, not Dani Filth high or BM high) pitched scream to a gutteral scream.<br />As for the album itself, it has to be one of the best cds I've got, perhaps the best. Every track rips, there's something for everyone in every track. Almost all have solos, they all have some singing parts, they all have catchy riffs and almost all are mostly hardcore (not the genre, the adjective). Perhaps the best album of 2003, and yes, it has taken me awhile to review it I know!<br />Highlights include I Won't See You Tonight Parts 1 &amp; 2, Chapter Four, Remenissions, Unholy Confessions and Second Heartbeat to name just a few to save space! Anyway, check it out, the entire cd is sick, just get it.<br />And if you're dissapointed.......seea doctor!
B00006AW2M|2.0|Although this is a big mess (the stones response to the beatles epic sergeant pepper),there are at least a few redeeming moments,which is more then I can say for anything they have done for about the last 30 years!!! So,if you feel you need this,and the price is right,go ahead,just don't expect much.
0375707972|1.0|Didn't like this one bit.  Slow, dull and predictable, with uninteresting prose and characters.  The &quot;surprise twist&quot; toward the end of the book was neither surprising nor much of a twist.  Avoid.

B00011D1OA|4.0|&quot;My Fair Lady&quot; turned me into a big fan of Audrey.  I have grown very fond of the British culture with the language drillling, the high tea, the Ascot Day and many other plots in the film.  From the bonus material on Disc 2, I found reservoirs of information about the film, which was produced well before I was born.  Even the commentary in the Disc 1 was very informative.  The sound mixing was so poor that I tried several times to foucs on the commentary but failed.  To some points, I was so annoyed that I tried to deactivate the sound track of the actors and the commentors but failed again.  I would rather WB put it in a separate disc.  Like what Eliza's father said, &quot;I am willing to pay extra for this.  I am waiting to pay extra for this.  I am wanting to pay extra for this.&quot;
B00005JLR8|4.0|At the start of &quot;In America&quot; we are introduced a family of illegal immigrants.  This is a bit surprising because Johnny (Paddy Considine) and Sarah (Samantha Morton), along with their two young daughters, Christie (Sarah Bolger) and Ariel (Emma Bolger), are an Irish family driving across the border into the United States from Canada.  After all, we have been conditioned to think of people of color as constituting the faces of illegal immigrants and the story of Irish immigration to America was largely a 19th-century tale.<br />However, the idea of this family being illegal immigrants is not important to the heart of the story and there is a sense in which the only reason it is brought up is so that the officials at the border can ask how many children the parents have, because one says &quot;three&quot; and the other says &quot;two.&quot;  This is how we first learn about Frankie, the young son whose tragic death haunts his parents and is never far from the thoughts of young Christie and her precious cam corder.  A gulf has been created between the two sisters, and Ariel complains that she has no one to tell her secrets to.  This is a key idea because Christie does: Frankie.<br />The family struggles to survive in New York City.  They find an apartment in a less than savory building, which makes you wonder whether things were really worse for them in Ireland or if we are supposed to think that they have made a mistake coming to the New World.  Johnny wants to be an actor and ends up being a cab driver while Sarah, unable to teach, becomes a waitress in a ice cream shoppe, while the girls are dispatched to Catholic school.  There the national anthem has Ariel worried about a blind man named Jose and the girls stand out because their Halloween costumes are homemade.  But the debacle of Halloween and the strange American ritual of going trick-or-treat results in the family ends up with the girls making a connection with the &quot;man who screams,&quot; a tormented Nigerian artist, Mateo (Djimon Hounsou) who lives downstairs.  This relationship becomes important, especially when Sarah becomes pregnant and there are complications.<br />For me this film boils down to a final wish.  Sarah, who provides the film's sparse narration, tells us early on that she has three wishes that she can ask of Frankie that he will grant her.  He told her this before he died and she has absolute faith that this is the case and when her first two wishes are granted we become true believers as well.  But as Jim Sheridan's film reaches its climax Sarah is faced with too many choices for that final wish and the only thing that mattered to me was what this 11-year-old girl would wish for in the end.  I think everyone who gets caught up in the decision will be surprised by the choice.<br />Both Morton and Hounsou were nominated for Oscars, in the Best Actress and Best Supporting Actor categories respectively, but it was the interplay between the real life sisters playing Christie and Ariel that captivates us.  It is so natural and unaffected that its reality comes as a shock.  The acting in this film is uniformly strong, which is why it is easy to forgive those points where Sheridan become a bit too manipulative.  But for me, in the end, &quot;In America&quot; comes down to Sarah Bolger's Christie, complaining that Ariel has already become an American because she says &quot;cool,&quot; singing &quot;Desperado&quot; during a concert at her new school, telling her father&quot; &quot;Don't &quot;little girl&quot; me. I've been carrying this family on my back for over a year,&quot; and using the final wish that Frankie gave her.rmented Nigerian artist, Mateo (Djimon Hounsou) who lives downstairs.

0812550706|3.0|I really enjoyed reading ENDER'S GAME, although I certainly had a few qualms along the way.  I found it to be an entertaining, engrossing read that had me quickly flipping through the pages, eager to see what came next.  But, to be honest, I'm a bit baffled by the overwhelming praise directed towards this book.  Sure, it's good, but I didn't find it nearly as powerful as others have.  <br />Plot is the most important part of this book, coming at the expensive of style.  The prose is mostly workmanlike, though it's deceptively good at slowly ratcheting up the tension.  Characters are virtually nothing more than ciphers for the storyline, and while they're distinctive, they're rarely given much depth.  Ironically, I felt the only character that approached full-development was Ender's sister, Valentine, and she is really only defined by her relations with her two brothers.<br />One thing I should mention is that I absolutely hated the ending of this book.  Hated, hated, hated it.  It took the suspension of disbelief that I'd been managing to hold onto for three hundred pages and just threw that out the window.  I can accept that selectively bred children can be perfectly reasoning geniuses.  I can even accept that they can talk in perfectly formed little speeches to each other (though this is a bit harder to digest, to be honest).  But I simply cannot believe that any organization (I'm being deliberately vague in order to avoid spoilers) would allow that certain decision to be made by a character of that age.  It's laughable.  Ridiculous.  And unfortunately, coming at the end as it did, it put a bit of a bad taste in my mouth.  Not enough to ruin the previous chapters, mind you, but enough to turn me just a little bit away.  I can take (and often enjoy) fictions that are overly cynical, but this seemed to be cynical just for the sake of being cynical, i.e. very contrived.  It felt exploitative and manipulative.  Given that the main themes of the book are exploitation and manipulation, this may very well have been deliberate, and the reaction I felt was exactly what the author wanted me to feel.  But you can't expect me to like it.<br />Maybe the kudos that this book receives is because it's a fictional novel that asks and hints at a lot of heavy, deep philosophical questions.  Of course, humankind has been asking these same questions for a few thousand years now, and I'm not convinced that ENDER'S GAME is bringing anything particularly new to the table.  Truthfully, I enjoyed this book simply as a straightforward science-fiction action-adventure, nothing more.  The philosophizing and moral dilemmas were presented in a slightly too clumsy and obvious a manner for my tastes.  Clearly, mileage will vary on this point, as many, many others would evidentially appear to have got a lot more out of this than I did.<br />That said, I think the book's attempt to tell the story more or less completely from the point of view of an especially gifted child was a success.  On the other hand, the eventual reason for the main characters being so young does come across as a bit of cheat at the end, and one wonders if it wouldn't have been a tad more believable to make these mature-seeming people just a slight bit older in age too.  Still, it worked for me, so I can't complain too much.  When Ender must deal with bullies and other &quot;child&quot; problems, he is presented as more (adult) rational than (child) emotional (not what I would have expected), but ultimately he does come across well as an unusually composed youth.  The parts where I really felt disturbed by the cast's age was during the more bloody of the fight scenes; in particular, when two pre-pubescent boys stand naked in a bathroom kicking each other in the groin until one of them collapses.  I suppose the point was to make the reader uncomfortable, but I think it really could have been done better in a less distasteful way.<br />My copy of the book (a paperback of the 1991 reissue)contains an overly defensive introduction from Orson Scott Card wherein he attacks opponents of his book for being too insecure and unable to empathize with gifted, intelligent children.  He seems to be of the mind that people either loved his book unconditionally or loathed it utterly, with no room for opinions in the middle.  Looking around at the other reviews, he may very well be right.  But I find myself in a rare position.  I abhorred some portions of this book, but really enjoyed others.  Overall, it more than maintained my interest and kept me speeding through, and I'll give it a lot of credit for that.  I didn't fall in love with the novel, but I enjoyed it enough that I'll probably get around to the sequels eventually.<br />(Oh, and I was amused to note that Card seems to have correctly predicted the rise of the Internet-based political blogs, although he does get confused as to whether he wants his would-be power-grabbers to be merely influencing memes or controlling people and events directly.  Of course, in his fictional universe, we're to believe that people take on-line political scribblings a lot more seriously than they do in ours.)
0743201140|4.0|This book is best described as a 'formula' for finding your strong points, skills and talents. I found it helpful--intriguing at times, but the results of what it suggests are fully dependent on how you answer various questions. It is helpful to know your strengths--especially when trouble happens. In this genre, I really like 'With Joseph in the University of Adversity', but would be hard pressed to pick between the two.
B0001Z363W|3.0|After the success of &quot;The Blessed Hellride,&quot; Zakk decided to slow things down a bit with this record. There's no problem with slowing things down, specially since it's called &quot;Hangover Music,&quot; but the album is quite uneven. The first track, &quot;crazy or high&quot; is great; the song is slower, but still has a ripping solo and cool lyrics. The next couple of songs are good too, especially &quot;Stepping Stone,&quot; but then the album falls off. There are still a few other good songs, but not enough. While the first three songs are a mix of slow and fast, the latter songs are mostly slow and not very good. &quot;Woman don't cry&quot; and &quot;She deserves a Free Ride&quot; are both good examples of some of the worthless and uninspiring songs found on &quot;Hangover Music.&quot; It's not so much that the first three songs have such a great balance between heavy and slow, they're just much, much better than the rest of the songs. Also, Zakk tries to sing with a little too much soul, he is out of his element when attempting to do so. This album isn't bad, but it's not that great either. In any case it should have been released as a solo record, not a BLS record - this sounds nothing like BLS. As for the incredibly cheesy and out-of-place cover with the two skulls, I don't know what to say about that.
B0001GOH6Q|5.0|i am a HUGE movie buff, and this is the best movie i have seen in a long time. it is so imaginative and really brings you into the story. tim burton really is a genius. i would absolutely reccommend this movie to anyone who has good taste.
B00003CXXJ|2.0|Some people absolutely adore this movie.  I really wanted to like &quot;Shrek&quot;.  Unfortunately, and I know I'm in the minority on this, I didn't.  The tale is a promising one.  Beast (with a heart) meets Beauty (who has a secret).  They fight, fall in love, her secret is revealed, they fight some more, then end up together, in typical fairy tale fashion.  However, this story is told, infused with crude humor and really only one likeable character: the Donkey, voiced by Eddie Murphy.  Even this character gets obnoxious.  Anachronistic touches, like adding Joan Jett's &quot;Bad Reputation&quot; (a song of which I am a fan) do not further the story and bring into question what audience this movie is trying to reach.  (The lyric clearly says, &quot;I don't give a damn 'bout my Bad Reputation&quot;).  Is this necessary in a family film?  I'm not a prude about language, but this doesn't add anything.<br />With &quot;Shrek 2&quot; due to be the hottest new thing, I will probably plunge deeper into the minority of those not enchanted by &quot;Shrek&quot;.  It didn't grab me and I know I'm not the only one.
B00005JMEW|5.0|I have never considered myself a Tarantino &quot;fan&quot; and probably still don't.  However, &quot;Kill Bill, Volume 1&quot; has all of the pieces I remember from my youth, watching any old martial arts films or shows I could find.  An &quot;homage&quot; film in it's purest and most un-apologetic form, &quot;Kill Bill&quot; is true to the craft and cuts no corners.  The soundtrack is fabulous, and the movie plays like live-action anime.  While I didn't care much for &quot;Pulp Fiction&quot;, and was a bit leery about &quot;Bill,&quot; I'm so glad I saw the film.  I rate it as one of my new all-time favorites.
B0001Z363W|1.0|Let me preface this by saying that I've been a Zakk Wylde fan ever since he joined Ozzy Osbourne's band in the late 80's.  I loved Pride &amp; Glory and enjoyed his BLS projects, but none really matched my love for Book of Shadows.<BR>Having said that, you can imagine I had high expectations for Hangover Music Vl 6.  Boy, was I disappointed.  The songwriting severely lacks.  It sounds as if Zakk really rushed through these songs.  Unfortunately, Zakk never had the best voice in the world, but he was always able to back it up with either crushingly heavy guitars or great songwriting.  Here, there's some decent guitarwork, but much of the time, it doesn't flow with the song.  &quot;A Whiter Shade of Pale&quot; sounds like it was performed during a drunken hangover, hence the album's title.  All I have to say is, Zakk, what happened?!?
B00003CXCT|3.0|To anyone who \\"likes\\" these movies, these reviews will probably not sway their decision to pick them up when their long over due release on DVD finally happens.  However, for those who use the word \\"love\\" in describing their affinity with these films, that day of shopping on Amazon will be bitter sweet.  The sad truth is the trilogy that is being released here in not the modern classic, not the cultural phenominon, not the childhood memory of millions of people who love them.  They are doctored, unauthentic, added-to and altered, shells of the great films that these \\"Special Editions\\" owe their success to.  It is a shameful reality that the original films are not being released along side these not-so-special editions.  George Lucas considers these editions the \\"finished\\" movies and does not intend to release the originals any more than he would consider releasing a \\"rough cut\\" of any other film.  He considers the original classics his works in progress, entirely overlooking their importance to people on a personal level, or the trilogy's contributions to film history as significant pieces of work from their original time period.  If Vincent Van Gogh were to rise from the grave and decide to paint a few more Iris's into his classic painting, would the world not miss the original?  It would make about as much sense as this impostor of a trilogy.  Will those who love these films buy the \\"special editions\\" anyway?  Yes.  Would they have rather had the originals? Probably.  Is a crying shame that George Lucas ignores the movie lovers to whom he owes his success?  Absolutely.
038073186X|5.0|Dennis Lehane's new novel,set in a hospital for the criminally insane in the paranoid 1950s, hits all the right notes and proves to be an excellent follow-up to his critically and commercially successful Mystic River.  My tastes run to moody suspense thrillers over gritty realism, so I found Shutter Island to be an even more entertaining read than Mystic River.  As a pure exercise in writing and plotting, one could hardly find a better model of how to manipulate, mislead, tantalize, and ultimately, satisfy the reader.  Those reviewers who have judged this novel to be shallow and devoid of serious moral impact, are simply wrong.  Shutter Island provides a more stylized, but equally powerful indictment of violence and its impact on the psyche of the survivor as Mystic River. What a complex and fascinating protagonist Lehane creates in U.S. Marshall Teddy Daniels!  What sets this novel apart from the run of the mill thriller, is the author's remarkable ability to weave the various threads of memory, guilt, delusion, and empathy into an absolutely compelling character. The plotting is ingenious! This novel takes the reader to a very strange place. I have seen hints of this sort of thing in a few other popular books and movies.  Stephen King's Secret Window and the recent film Swimming Pool come to mind, but neither of those psychological thrillers ultimately pack the impact of Teddy Daniels' search for truth and justice on Shutter Island.
0345440900|5.0|I like to think of this book as the &quot;owner's manual&quot; that babies don't come with.  It's such a feeling of relief to have an idea of why the baby is crying, or what he's trying to tell you.  You'll really learn a lot from this book!
B00005JME0|5.0|I'm suprised at some people who have competely slated this film and said how terrible it is. I, and one of my friends were both in agreement that the film is extremely well put together and with an excellent plot. The only flaw is maybe the film is a bit too sick for some in places. The film isn't gory however, but while you don't see the horrible scenes, (mother and baby being blown up by dynamite, dog being set on fire whilst alive) you do know exactly what has happened. So not Reccommended if you can't stomach that kind of thing. Despite this, I think it's an excellent film, which is why I'm giving it 5 stars. Well worth seeing
B00005JMFQ|1.0|The fact is, Love Actually gives viewers quite a few love stories, and it doesn't give the viewer time to connect. What is romantic? Romantic is seeing a couple fall in love, not 3035903509295208 couples talk about love. By the time the viewer may feel any connection to a character, a new story starts and the viewer is lost. I didn't pull one name out of this film and didn't get to connect with one character. Also, the pacing in this film is horrible. Right when a story might seem interesting, a new one starts and a new character is introduced.<br />Love Actually tries to do too many things in a short time. The directing isn't that good and it's only saving grace is Hugh Grant. Also, a lot of the leads have no chemistry whatsoever. They just picked some top-notch stars and expected love. Sorry, but it just doesn't work that way...
B00000AFGM|5.0|This is my favorite Manson album by far. Yes, it was a drastic change from the angry, harder rocking Antichrist Superstar, but I thought it was a change for the best. This made critics accept Manson as an artist, rather than a novelty act for teenagers who want to piss off their parents. This album contains much more personal lyrics with repeated references to drugs and depression. If your in the mood for some harder tracks, Mechanical Animals has that too. &quot;Rock Is Dead&quot;, &quot;The Dope Show&quot;, and &quot;User Friendly&quot; should give you your fill. But this is a more slow, contemplative, beautiful album. Godd*mn, I love it.
0920668372|5.0|and not at this book. It is so sweet and put me to tears while I read it to my baby boy. I am disgusted that people would read such awful things into such a sweet story...incest and stalking...thats just ridiculous.. I also let others read it and they also found it nothing but sweet.....<BR>I know I'll teach my son that it means that a mothers love for her child has no end and that no matter what, I will always be there to comfort and soothe him no matter how old he gets and that when I need him, I know he will be there for me....
B00000IYWH|5.0|this album had  a lot going for it, the technology in the studio had made incredible  advances as compared to elvis'  early days  for rca.  the only thing missing would have been a  video or<BR>motion picture film shot, as  elvis laid down the tracks for this  great album.!
B00005M91K|5.0|If you've traveled the world or even just the U.S. you'll recognize many of the locations. The photography is incredible - Some scenes are a combination of time-lapse and panning that let you view the stars, the earth, and its inhabitants in entirely new perspectives. This is documentation of life, death, growth, and change that needs to be experienced.
B0001O2KQW|5.0|i bought this album  when it was released in every formatt<BR>it came out in...including   quadraphonic,  which  rca  should have re mastered these tracks and released it as a full album.<BR>great rock and roll and variety.<BR>duke bardwell  on bass, polk salad annie  was  very good..!
B00007G207|3.0|I am among those who succumbed to curiosity and watched the new, extended cut.  And I fervently wish I could erase it from memory.  Nary a frame of it adds to the original story; in fact, it brazenly and systematically dilutes and sullies all the magic of the original.  It trots out worn cliches about recapturing childhood and second chances, and makes out Alfredo to be a bitter back-stabber.  Watching older Toto stalk Elena was like watching a train wreck in slow motion.  DAMN!  HOW can I recapture the original's beauty?<br />There's good reason many of us are championing the original.  There's good reason the original was released the way it was.  Don't feebly tell me about needing 'closure' or 'more-is-better' garbage.  Stay with the original, and use your imagination.  Trust me.<br />5 stars for the original, a generous 2 for the new cut, = 3 stars.
B0000BYM3K|3.0|Ok, as anybody will tell you this is a Maiden throwback album, and there in lies the problem. They want to keep the sound the same for all the fans that know and love the band, and for a very good reason: Maiden Rocks. This album sadly does not rock as much as it could have for the very simple reason that the songwriting is average, not bad but nothing really to brag about and because they have three guitarists but sound like they only have one. The solos sound horribly flat and not anything that is really amazing. With three guitars they could be playing two solos at the same time kinda like a dueling solo and also have one play rythym guitar. However they do not do this and the guitar work sounds pretty flat in every track with the notable exception of the title track which in my opinion is the hands down best track on the album. Overall this album sounds just like Iron Maiden is meant to sound but lacks the excitement that usually surrounds them and the ingenuity that somehow left them. (Note it was still there for Brave New World)
B000000WJZ|5.0|This is by far the best album in my collection and definitely the best Smashing Pumpkins album. Every song is great but my personal favorites are &quot;Hummer&quot;, &quot;Mayonaise&quot;, &quot;Cherub Rock&quot;, &quot;Soma&quot; and &quot;Spaceboy&quot;. Truly a masterpiece, Billy Corgan proves its ability writing songs full of feeling and the instrumental performance is admirable.
B0001LJC2K|5.0|Okay, I'll be the first to admit that I am a total elitist when it comes to albums that I'll listen to more than once.  Muse's new album &quot;Absolution&quot; is overwhelmingly beautiful, from the pounding opening chords in &quot;apocalypse please&quot; to the interwoven classical piano textures in &quot;butterflies and hurricanes&quot;.  Each song is an individual, with breathtaking cadences and especially gorgeous climaxes.  They create connotations of extreme sorrow, yet, somehow, sense of fullness (due to the maturity of the composition).  What keeps &quot;Absolution&quot; above overwhelming the listener is the rock-like, almost electronica beginnings and interludes throughout each song.  You could consider Muse in the same genre as Radiohead and (not so much) Coldplay, but &quot;Absolution&quot; is a chord above the rest in maturity.  Thank God someone on this Earth can mix the perfect fusion of Rock, Classical, and pure passion!
B0000C8AVX|5.0|This album, along with &quot;Highway 61 revisited&quot; and &quot;Another side of Bob Dylan&quot; all get five stars from me.  I could write a book on how great this album is.  &quot;She belongs to me&quot; and &quot;Love minus zero&quot; are my two faves from this album.  This is truly desert island stuff.  Complete your classic rock collection by owning this and the other two mentioned Dylan classics.
B0000TG9E2|5.0|This is one of the best DVDs to come out in a whlie. Though the movie it contains is not neccessarily Disney's most readily accessible title (except for during the sixties when they found out it had gained popularity on college campuses, know-what-I-mean, nudge-nudge) it is two discs of pure Disney magic.<br />Setting aside the feature, which we all know is one of the best adaptations of Lewis Carroll's works (and if not the most accurate, certainly the most \\"watchable,\\" as it is just dark enough to keep that edge but...well, let me put it this way: have you SEEN another version of \\"Through the Looking Glass?\\" I need a stiff drink before getting into that) the real highlight of this disc is the special features.<br />Two TV introductions by Walt, a 1950's making-of featurette, vintage television programs includin the historic \\"One Hour in Wonderland\\" the first Disney TV show, a whole album's worth of demos for songs that were never used, concept art galleries and more. This disc is an essential for anyone, like me, who is in love with Disney animation.<br />If for no other reason than the \\"One Hour in Wonderland\\" show features a clip from \\"Song of the South.\\" It's worth buying the whole disc just for that, since it's the closest that movie's ever going to come to a DVD release in this lifetime.
B00004YA66|4.0|This movie by no means will rescue Hollywood from it's descent into cheesiness, but it is one that has a style that seems to be long lost.  This is without a doubt Dennis Quaid's best performance.  Along with a solid plot, and great acting from his supporting cast, this movie held me captive from beginning to end.  I loved it the first time I saw it and I watched it again the other day and loved it even more.  I highly recommend this movie.
B00003CXB4|4.0|When it was released in 1994, &quot;The Lion King&quot; was the most successful animated movie of all time, and that's hardly surprising. An inspired, vaguely-Shakespearean story, a gifted voice cast, five irresistable songs, and that flavor of Africa provided largely by Hans Zimmer and his South African cohort, Lebo M.<br />This new trend of Disney's, releasing a series of immersive DVDs, is terrific for buffs like me. And between the behind-the-scenes featurettes, the deleted materials, and a whole section dedicated to the Broadway musical, I really have only one complaint...<br />How the heck do you turn of &quot;The Morning Report?&quot; That is a terrible song, and the dialogue it replaces is infinitely better. Poor Rowan Atkinson.
B00005OAIE|3.0|I can't say I love this album, but there are a couple of songs here worth mentioning.  &quot;Why Georgia&quot; is a classic.  I love this song.  Also &quot;83.&quot;  Another great song.  I would recommend owning this cd just for those two songs.  Most of the rest of the songs on this cd are not that impressive to me, but every time I listen to &quot;Why Georgia&quot; I have to go back and hear it again, sometimes twice.  That song is a classic and if you could give one song five stars, that would be the one.  I think this young man deserves to be successful, his music is a breath of fresh air in a deteriorating music industry.
B0000508U6|1.0|I wouldn't buy this album just for the fact that it's british pop and I hate it. But, in general there's nothing to this album. It all goes in a straight line. You could consider them beautiful songs but I just find them boring as hell. If he's so depressed as he sounds why doesn't he do us all a favor and jump off a cliff or something? Jeez, get over it. Stop whining and start rocking.
B0001Z53AQ|2.0|This cd is a total failure.  They have not brought anything new to the table.  Devil's Night was an amazing cd.  These songs sound like they wrote it in 30 minutes, similiar to Sisqo's albums.  I think the Eminem Show is over, there is nothing possible to save this album.  Except for the songs with some real producers, &quot;D12 World&quot; by Kanye West, &quot;American Psycho II&quot; by Dr. Dre, the cd is pure garbage.  It sounds like a album that's half sucking up to 50 Cent, and half to Marilyn Manson.
B0001Z53AQ|1.0|Do not buy this cd, and make them think it's good. Totally unoriginal, and it doesn't feel like there is definite start or end. It's just a bunch of quickly made beats by Dre, with some repetitive lyrics. Eminem has apparenly lost his talent. If you want a good cd by him, go get &quot;Slim Shady LP&quot;. Bizarre is probably the high point in this cd. At least he has some originality, and can actually make you laugh.
B0001FR3IQ|3.0|Great Cinematography, trite uncreative dialog......I was not blown away by the ending.....I figured it out.<BR>Very &quot;the Ring&quot;-ish
B0000CAXID|5.0|This cd is very good. Dave Grohl is a genius, and absolutely shows it here. It is extremely melodic and meaningful. My favorite songs are &quot;I'll stick around&quot; and &quot;Big Me&quot;. Check it out.
0812567110|4.0|Art for art's sake?  Oscar Wilde's \\"Dorian Gray\\" is about youth, corruption, and esthetics.  Reflective of Wilde's own life and revolt against Victorian era sentimentality, young Dorian Gray slowly changes after his philosophical discussions with the cynical Lord Henry Wotton, whose cold criticisms and harsh wit are often humorous in an addictively jaded kind of way, and tempting to arm oneself with; however, read on and observe Wilde's destruction of Lord Henry's young protoget.  The immediate power of Basil Hallward's portrait of Dorian retains a demonic hold on its confused subject, taunting and torturing his vanity with its strangely metamorphizing characteristics.  Who's changing, and what exactly is changing?  Wilde creates an unforgettable \\"portrait\\" here of one man's (or is it the whole of Victorian society?) demise.  Many critics of Wilde have seen him and \\"The Portrait of Dorian Gray\\" as pure evil and criticized the undertones of homosexuality, and linked it with a lifestyle of debauchery and degradation.  Wilde was thrown in jail for his \\"unlawful activities\\".  To them I must concur with Wilde, that \\"Those who find ugly meanings in beautiful things are corrupt without being charming. This is a fault.\\"
B00007E8V4|5.0|This album is the sh-t !! It is powerful, energetic, and has very good political points. System of a down has done it again. They are one of these bands that never wear out. Some of the best songs on there are &quot;Mr. Jack&quot;, &quot;Highway Song&quot;, and &quot;Pictures&quot; is cool too.<BR>If you liked Toxicity, you'll like this one. Go get it dammit.
0792140923|5.0|It took me over two hours to try to develop a persueding review on Forrrest Gump but I couldnt throw in every single good thing about it without exceeding the 1,000 word limit so take it from me. Tom Hanks is brilliant in this film and I would recommend it to anybody. It has loads of drama, comedy, romance, and even aspects of historical character (Although it is a bit distorted) This is the best film I have ever seen and I can't emphasize enough how perfect it is for all movie-goers.
B000059PR5|5.0|I've seen &quot;The Day After&quot; when I was a child of 10-11 in 1986-1987 in a small village in Siberia called Maya, near Yakutsk, USSR. The movie was shown over the whole Soviet Union twice on the first channel. Since then I remember the movie very clearly, the impression I got was very high, so I immediately started to deeply realize the horror of a nuclear catastrophe. We were on the other side of the Cold War propaganda. I remember at school how we were taught about the US predator imperialistic policy. We always had lessons at school how to behave in case of US nuclear attack and practiced it physically running down to underground rooms wearing gas-masks and helping each other. The US nuclear threat, I believed, was so real, so I was frightened of a sight of a shining plane board in the sky. I was sure it were Americans going to bomb my village. And this hysteria was everywhere in USSR. Now living in Moscow, the heart of an almost free country of Russia I realize that the topicality of the movie hasn't dissappeared. We still face a lot of threats around the world, including terrorism and nuclear war. I'm sure all this comes from people's indifference, jealosy, prejudice, ignorance... Watch the movie and let our children know and grow.
0156027321|5.0|When I bought this book, I had no high hopes.  In attempting to broaden my repertoire of modern literature I bought both this book and the equally excellent 'The curious incident of the Dog at night'.<br />The premise for this book somehow left me with the impression that the 'animals' would start talking to each other as soon as the ship sank beneath the waves.  You can rest assured, Richard Parker, the Bengal Tiger, and his compatriots speak in actions rather than words.<br />The faith and religious connotations of this book are widely published, in my view unfairly so.  Yes the boy, Pi, shows remarkable piety and faith, but this is much more an issue in his normal life.  Once the liftboat starts to drift, with 226 and a half days left, Pi reverts to his own, marvellous, ingenuity.  Despite occassional references to God, and a dogged resilience of faith (as the term suggests!) I feel that the miracle of the survival and the journey have much more pragmatic than theological roots.<br />Much is also made of the ending of the book.  To this I can only say that it is awe-inspiringly unique.  The very idea which sets in slowly at first, left me thinking about it for days, as more and more implications surfaced.<br />Buy this book.  It is a fantastic, original and thoroughly enjoyable modern read.
0446310786|4.0|I enjoyed reading To Kill A Mockingbird. Not only was this novel immediately interesting, but it taught important lessons about life. One of those lessons, was overcoming racism. Throughout the novel Tom Robinson is the obvious example of racism, but less obvious, is the treatmeant of Boo Radley. Boo is not treated poorly because of his skin color, but because he is considered an &quot;outkast&quot;. Throughout the novel Scout has to learn to recognize racism, and to realize that society's views of people are not always correct. A quote that shows Scout being taught this is found in Chapter 3 on page 33, when Atticus states &quot;You never really understand a person until you consider things from his point of view...until you climb into his skin and walk around in it.&quot;<BR>Another major roll in this novel was the developing innocence of the children. Throughout the novel we are viewing Scout's morals developing into a more &quot;grown-up&quot; point of view. At first, Scout plays games with her brother Jem and neighbor Dill, mocking the Radleys. However, as the novel progresses, she starts to think of Boo Radley as a human being, instead of a form of entertainment.<BR>Another roll in this novel was played by scoical standings. The importance of social standings constantlt understand the ignorance  of the townspeople. I believe that the quote said by Atticus in Chapter 10 page 109, &quot;Remember, it's a sin to kill a mockingbird,&quot; shows that Atticus wants his children to understand that people should be given their privacy, and not discussed throughout the town because of their short comings.<BR>Other than the lessons in this book, another great aspect of it is the setting. The town is introduced in Chapter 1 on page 2, as &quot;An old town, but it was a tired old town when I first knew it.&quot; I believe that this quote was the perfect way to describe Maycomb. It shows that at first, the town is innocent, like Scout, but also foreshadows that the town, and Scout will develope into a more comlex exisctence. Anoher important part of this book was the characters. The characters were well developed and were very complex. I felt like the Finches were a real life family, one that I could truly understand, and one that over the course of the novel I actually grew to care about.<BR>If you enjoyed reading To Kill A Mockingbird, then I would recommend the book I Know Why The Caged Bird Sings, by Maya Angelou. The plot about racism is similar and the styles of writing are equally intriguing.
0380730367|5.0|The only thing I can say about Dennis Lehane is: \\"When's the next one going to print?\\" For myself, I thought 'Prayers' dialogue was a bit snappier, more colorful, than the others but that's me. One of the many things I enjoy about Lehane's writing is that he puts as much effort into the last ten pages as he did the first ten. In detective and mystery stories, that's rare indeed.
6302787300|5.0|A curiosity piece with a politically correct slant, &quot;1492&quot; is an epic drama well worth viewing. It is held together by the fabulous cinematography (on location in Spain and Costa Rica by Adrian Biddle), the splendid score by Vangelis, and the powerful screen presence of Gerard Depardieu; it could however, have used some subtitles, not for the dialogue of the island natives, but for Depardieu...his English is appalling, and at times hard to decipher.<br />The &quot;evils of civilization&quot; are represented by the lust for gold, massive scenes of violence where impaling on swords and sharp sticks seems to be the &quot;gore du jour&quot;, and the bigotted, and avaricious &quot;Moxica&quot;, played by Michael Wincott, who always makes such a good villain. Others in the cast of note are Sigourney Weaver as a beautiful Isabel, and Armand Assante as Sanchez.<br />This film gets one historical thing right; the people who opposed Columbus' voyage did so not because they thought the world was flat (a myth many still believe) but because they thought he was incorrect in his calculations of the earth's circumference, which he was...by an enormous amount. Lucky for Columbus, the New World was waiting to be discovered !<br />At about 2 ½ hours, it could have used some trimming, but it's nevertheless an intriguing film, and a must for history buffs and Depardieu fans.<br />&quot;Paradise and hell both, can be earthly; we carry them with us wherever we go&quot;.
B00013RC9I|4.0|Who am I to tell you what to buy?  If you want something different that isnt Radiohead, then buy this album.  The French duo have taken a more simplistic approach on this little ditty.  Its catchy and somewhat cheesy at times, but gosh darn it its good stuff and besides thats what they were shootin' for anywho!  Listen to it once, and like the chip ad says, you can't eat just one.  *disclaimer-cds ain't edible.  If you don't own Moon Safari and consider yourself a music buff, you should shoot off your thumbs cause you ain't right.  Buy it. Buy both.  Drink some wine eat some crepes.
B00005JMSE|5.0|As of this writing, Hellboy has left the multiplex in my city.  I thought this movie fills the void left by X-Files and the Night Stalker.  It was entertaining, yet close to the comic to satiate the purists. Kitty cat fans also get a treat by watching this flick.  It would seem that there is still some gold to be mined from comic book adaptations.  Too bad the Punisher had to come around a few weeks later. brrrrr.
B000066NW0|5.0|This CD - Album is really a treat.  Musically, it's one good compilation.  There's only one track I have difficulty listening to (that's the first one).  All the others are very, very good.  It's a fresh sound.  It's upbeat.  It's one of those CDs that doesn't come along very often.  The more I see and hear of Avril Lavigne the person (in interviews or on Saturday night live) the less I like Avril the person.  However, after 2 years of listening to this CD, I still find it compelling and find myself drawn into the songs.  <br />So, in spite of Avril's odd personality, I'm very much looking forward to buying her next album that's due out on May 25th.<br />I can't wait!
B00005JMJ4|1.0|The praise and attention this movie was recieving in theaters and the Oscars drove me to check this movie out. I have never been more disgusted at a movie. The movie was so incredibly boring that I found myself drowsing during most of the film. Although labled as a comedy, I did not even get a slight smile out of the film. The acting was shameful, esecially for such icons as Bill Murray and Scarlett Johansen and the storyline itself was so basic and boring the whole point of the movie could have been conveyed in five minutes rather than dragging it out into a whole movie. This movie was a waste of time...don't bother wasting your time or money to see it.
0312979479|3.0|&quot;And Then There Were None&quot;, is a mystery book that is wrote by the author, Agatha Christi, who is by no surprise the number one best seller for mystery books. The book is taken place in Diltisham, Indian Island. Its about a mysterious man named Mr, Owen who invites 10 guests, who don't know eachother to his beautiful house on an Indian Island. Throughout the whole story the 10 guests try to figure out who Mr. Owen could be. Is he on the Island? Is he one of the 10? Or, did he not even come on the Island? ONe by one the 10 people are killed by a murderer's fantasy of a &quot;Ten Little Indians&quot; poem. Killing them based on the poem.<br />I thought the book &quot; And Then There Were None&quot;, was very well organized, descriptive, and well written. Agatha Christi does a great job with keeping you guessing till the end, of who the killer is. This book never has a dull moment, there is always something going on. There is a twist in the ending that you would have never expected.

0385510438|3.0|It is true, The Last Juror is a different style than other Grisham novels.  But this is not entirely a bad thing.  While his early work had fast-moving stories that kept you reading, the dialogue was often stilted, the characters poorly drawn, and the descriptions hackneyed.  That said, they were darn good reads.<br />The Last Juror is a good read too, but if you pick it up expecting him to rehash The Firm, you'll be disappointed, as witnessed by the number of negative reviews.  Personally, I was pleased by the developments in his style.  I spent Part 1 being sure I had read this book before.  And I had; it bears great resemblance to his earlier work.  Part 2 is where it becomes poetic, an homage to slow, small-town Southern life, and the improvements in Grisham's actual wordsmithing become evident.<br />Part 3 is the weakest - it feels rushed to wrap things up, and the ending was fairly dull.  But I was entranced by his descriptions and pleased by how rich and clear Clanton became.<br />Look, if you want to read The Firm, or A Time to Kill, read them.  No one will think less of you.  But if you want to chart this author's progress, this book is an excellent example.
B00005Y7PS|5.0|Iommi always write good songs and he didn't let me down on this record, the songs f'ckin rips, Tony Martin sings really good, and as I told you the songs kicks ass, in my mind there are not a weak track, I remember a couple of years ago when I played it in my car when I was going to work, 6 a clock in the morning and Anno mundi comin out of the speakers, the hair on arms just stands, it was really a great musical moment for me.<BR>And I love this record as just as much now.<BR>5/5
B0001W8Q9Y|5.0|For the first time in I don't know how long, they have me actually listening to the lyrics and contemplating their depth. I don't think Steve Hogarth gets nearly enough credit for the quality of his lyrics. Where Fish's lyrics were stunning to me when I was young, h's lyrics are marvelously deep and relevant to me now that I'm older and (hopefully) more mature. The music, as ever, is beautifully played. The more you listen, the more layers you hear. Absolutely stunning.
B00013RC9S|5.0|Other than expecting a 5.1 remix, I am VERY happy with the SACD sound of this release. This is an essential CD  for any jazz fan, capturing an all-star quintet hitting on all cylinders.
B000002MZ6|5.0|First there were the Tubular Bells series...then this comes along.<br />This masterpiece has so much going for it that comparisons to Mike Oldfield's other works just pale in comparison. That being said, it makes it an instant classic.<br />Distant thunder rolls and off we go to a ride that no one has ever been on before.  This is truly a masterpiece of sound and texture and Mike Oldfield proves once again it's not his prowess at manipulating musical tones on his instruments....but that he literally can control his musical genius and point directly at you with the command of a bullet.<br />I found certain parts of this piece truly breathtaking.  Even more fantastic, you don't have to listen to any else he has ever done to really appreciate the depth and beauty which this offers.  Again, a masterpiece...dont' miss out
B00005AWMF|5.0|If you, suprisingly enough, have no Sade in your album collection, then this best-of compilation could be a perfect start:<br /> *Best Of Sade as a COMPILATION (4/5):<BR>It's really hard to believe that a collection of the best moments of Sade could only include 16 songs. A double cd compilation woud be a more accurate realisation of that title. However, Sade have managed to put together all of their killer hits plus two or three numbers which were never big, but they're considered as the finest Sade moments (Jezebel, Pearls). A nice treat is the inclusion of 'Please Send me Someone to Love' which was originally released in the Philadelphia soundtrack. Moreover, some of their classic hits are different to the original album versions. For instance, Cherish the day provides you with one more minute of pleasurable trip-hop, which had been faded out at the original Love Deluxe version of this song. 'Paradise' has a slightly different sound mix and the versions of 'Never as Good as the First Time' &amp; 'Smooth Operator' are actually the video ones (the latter one without the whispering Sade intro and the 'Red Eye' instrumental at the end of Smooth Operator I'm afraid). However, some really great numbers, such as Tar Baby, Maureen &amp; Cherry Pie, which were measurable hits, have not been included here  and you might have to get the albums to discover them. (believe me, it's worth it..)<br />* Best Of Sade as the MUSIC (5/5):<BR>Well, Sade can do no wrong. And that's something that she herself confirmed with the release of 00's Lover's Rock. Most of the songs in this compilation have left their own mark in what we call pop music history. Your Love is King introduced to the public a new kind of smooth-martini music which the world had never heard before, Smooth Operator was an artsy display of how to use saxophone in pop music , the classy Is it a Crime? and the exotic-funky The Sweetest Taboo are amongst the biggest radio hits of pop/RnB music, while the Love Deluxe tracks included here remind us that this '92 album was one of the best moments in RnB music history.<br /> * The Best Of Sade as a RE-MASTERED VERSION (5/5):<BR>This '00 remastered version is worth buying, even for those who own the '94 original one. The sound is crispy and crystal clear, and you may discern sounds that you thought they never existed. The remastering work done on this compilation as well as on the rest of Sade's catalogue, is flawless and of an impeccable quality. In other artists' remasters, the sound is TOO bright or too boomed up through compression. Here, it's just pure music. It is just the songs, taken from the master tapes and offered a better treat (the best possible, actually) than they did ten or twenty years ago. Moreover, the Sade remasters might give you that spacious and warm feeling that one might recall from their original vinyl versions. It's just Sound-tastic!<br /> All in all, The Best Of Sade is a great purchase for those interested in finding out more about Sade's music and need something to start from.  The Fans, who own  Sade's album catalogue need this for 'Please give me someone to love' and for the different versions of some of the tracks. <BR> However, even if you're not interested in Sade this is a great plus for your collection, since a record collection without some Sade class in it can never be complete :)<br /> Enjoy!
B0001CCXY8|1.0|First of all, I want to disclaim that I am not here on a &quot;church mission&quot; to tell people how wrong this is.  Second, nor am I a 15 year old nu-metal brat that doesnt know what real music is.<br />That out of the way...<BR>cannibal corpse is just HORRIBLE!  Musically, they sound as horrificaly grotesque as their image and lyrics.  Ya, they can play fast...so what.  Every song is the exact same thing...constant banging and death &quot;growls&quot; repated over and over.  I honestly think that beating a metal trash can with a baseball bat while yelling in the lowest tone repeatedly sounds just the same and its free.  If they have skill, they do not let it show in their music.  If you want metal like this that is good, is actually music, and has lyrics that actually mean something...pick up &quot;Of One Blood&quot; from shadows fall.  <br />Because seriously, &quot;gross out&quot; tactics are short lived, and to be honest i just dont understand why the f*@#k somebody would even like something (not to mention, taking it seriously) that talks about nothing more than ripping up flesh...its disgusting for one, and its entirely irrelivent to anything.  Im no &quot;square&quot; who does not actually know what Im talking about, or who hasnt heard ALL kinds of things.  Im an avid Gwar fanatic, in fact.  They are gross, but their point is to mock bands like cannibal corpse who take themselves so seriously and they joke (not take themselves seriously about something so irrelivent).  I like heavy bands like As I Lay Dying, Shadows Fall, Atreyu among many others.  But cannibal corpse really is just pure trash with absolutely no point or skillful crafting behind their songs.  <br />If this was a joke, maybe I would have laughed for a little bit.  But they take them selves seriously and there is just no way these guys actually know anything about what they write.  Give me a break, like these guys actually do the things they sing about.  Give it a rest, cannibal corpse is worse than the same fart joke told over and over for a decade.  They stand for nothing and neither do their fans.  Both need to give it a rest, you make me sick.
B000092ZYX|5.0|Radiohead is an incredible band- their lyrics are random but yet they mean so much. All of their albums are incredible... INCLUDING their cd &quot;Amnesiac&quot; (which everyone seems to dislike)But anyway, other than &quot;OK Computer&quot; this cd is a true representation of what the band is like.
B000003TAR|5.0|This CD is really amazing, cobain made a lving out of a horrible life, and no doubt the raw emotion captured in songs, even the lesser known of the songs on this CD, Radio Friendly Unit Shifter for example, where he repeats &quot;what is wrong with me?&quot; really shows the world of a depressed person. Love it or hate it, Nirvana ultimately spoke true to the generation of rockers here today.
B00018D44U|4.0|&quot;Feels Like Home&quot;, the follow-up to widely (and wildly) celebrated debut &quot;Come Away With Me&quot; is not as easy listening album as its predecessor, which however does not mean that it's not as good. It may be even better, but its charms do not unfold so easily. Also, &quot;Home&quot; lacks the joy and elegance of some blues and pop tunes which were there the first time around; especially notable is the absence of songwriter Jesse Harris, who penned such gems as &quot;Shoot the Moon&quot; and &quot;Don't Know Why&quot;. The tones are mostly country, sometimes even alt-country, the mood is relaxed, thoughtful, even impressionistic, with the best cut saved for last, achingly beautiful &quot;Don't Miss You At All&quot;, written by the great Sir Duke. &quot;Feels Like Home&quot; is certainly an album difficult to get tired of, but its risk mainly lies in that some listeners may not get the patience they need until it finally grows on them. Most &quot;Come Away With Me&quot; lovers should enjoy &quot;Feels Like Home&quot; but those seeking instant gratification may fail easily.
076790592X|5.0|Tuesdays with morrie is an awsome book because it teaches us..to be real and basically to get over it.  We can all learn from Morrie because he talks from his heart and he tells us that you must live everyday as if it was your last.  Morrie taught that you should not want to be envied or envy because there is basically no need for it..you should just help people through out your life beacause you wont learn how to live, unless you learn how to die.  If yourself or anyone you know is facing any sort of problem in life or just like reading i highly suggest you read this book...you wont regret it!
B0000AQS0F|5.0|I am probably one of the few people who can say that they actually saw an advertisement for Firefly back when it was still on.  All it did, however, was make me dismiss Firefly as another sci-fi show a la Star Trek.  Oh how wrong I was...<br />  It was actually the massive amount of 5 star reviews here on Amazon that made me revisit the idea of giving the show a chance.  On a whim, I bought the DVD, and I never looked back.  This show is quality, no doubt about it, and its demise is further proof of the sad state that TV is in.<br />  From the storylines of the episodes, to the CGI effects (which I was not expecting to be so good!), to the wonderful characters, each with a unique personality and set of values, this show tops anything else that is currently on Fox. <br />  The 880 other reviews on this site (mine included) can not do this show justice.  Buy this DVD, you will not be dissapointed.
B0000DD7LB|5.0|I highly recommend &quot;In the Zone&quot; to anyone.  Each song has something different to offer and nothing sounds the same.  I was especially impressed by the quality and artistic elements of songs like Touch of My Hand, Toxic, Early Mornin', Breathe on me, &amp; Everytime.  Whether or not you're a fan of Miss Spears, I guarantee you'll find something to like on this album.  This is definitely her best work to date and truly the best of pop music!
0316666343|4.0|Perhaps the &quot;bones&quot; could also allude to Sebold's language, which is simple but musical in its word placement. I don't like overusing the term &quot;musical,&quot; but it fits here. I could sense more of a character's tension or wistfulness just in a certain position of a comma or the shortening of a sentence; the first chapter is particularly rhythmic: &quot;Gently, I did./The end came anyway.&quot; This occurs at later points too, though, refreshing the reader with beautiful figurative language when some of the story gets too facile or flat. <br />Not having a clearly defined religion, I didn't have any problems with Susie's heaven that way. It was interesting, in fact, to consider the afterlife as &quot;to each his own.&quot; And if you think about it, there is a mention of a possibly greater heaven when Susie is observing all the souls at night with Frannie. The individual heaven is poignant, too, even reflecting loneliness where traditionally, the dead aren't supposed to have any. I thought the &quot;grief circle&quot; was moving in this way; Susie also reflected her family's missing her--especially her father. Sebold illustrates the impact of losing a child and lingering over it too long; the survivors become a kind of ghost, too. She knows how to use characters to hint at her theme.<br />Some characters, though, were a bit undeveloped, particularly Ruth and Ray. Ruth just seemed like a medium thrown in for some reason, though she was useful to Susie in one scene. Ray just seemed like a romantic foil. Also, I think the story dragged on a bit as Susie felt like she had to tell us every little event her family went through, some of which had nothing to do with the story. With underdeveloped characters involved, this got a little tedious. At some points, it almost sounded like a typical YA story, but thankfully there were few of these low points. The ending is clever but almost too much so, if you know what I mean.<br />All in all, though, this is a gentle, gracefully written book worth keeping for at least the language, the &quot;what-ifs,&quot; and the dreamlike qualities.

0385507755|5.0|I could never predict what is going to happen next. I could not put down the book once I have picked it up and I found myself finished the 400+ with small font types within a week.<br />There are a few vivid scenes where my stomach were sooooooo wrenched and I had to cover my mouth and narrow my eyes and say &quot;arrrrghhhhhhhhhhhh&quot;. I was particularly horrified when I read the part where Frey has to fix his teeth without any painkillers nor anethesia...<br />The childhood of Frey made me feel really sad. The ignorance (from friends) and the withdrawal from people was the chief reason why he started using. The calm, the plain and the emotionaless description of his own past was particularly saddening. I was so appalled that he didn't even blame anyone for causing this (unlike what I would expect from most addict with such a pathetic past). There's no blaming, and he was totally ready to accept the consequence of his ruined life. <br />Frey also confronted a close encounter with drugs and alcohol near to the point of recovery (or temporary recovery). But it was something (you read it!) that saved him from the challenge from the &quot;devil&quot;.<br />The characters portraited not only include Frey himself. But also the lives and stories of some of the people he met in the center and the friendship between them. (There is a man who tries to stop swearing too much. And his &quot;pseudo swearing&quot; always made me laugh out loud!)<br />I also enjoyed the way Frey has written this book. It was written in an extremely hysterical manner (a lot of repetition a lot of &quot;and&quot;) to demonstrate the unstable mental state and the lack of sanity of him at the beginning. As Frey was getting better and better as the treatment moved on, I found the hysterical style was gradually becoming calmer and more peaceful.<br />I found myself finished the book within a week and every time I picked it up I could not put it down. I was so eager to know &quot;what will happen next&quot; and &quot;what will happen to these people&quot; and &quot;could frey make it&quot;.I enjoy the book very very much. If 5 stars is the max rating, I would give it a 6!
B00005UKE0|5.0|There's really not much more I can add about George Harrison's solo debut from 1970, &quot;All Things Must Pass.&quot; As it's been said so many times before, this album is without question George's signature masterpiece, and his greatest solo work of all-time. After living in the songwriting shadows of his Beatles bandmates John Lennon &amp; Paul McCartney, being confined to writing only one or two songs for each Beatles release (though he admittedly got a little more freedom on &quot;The White Album&quot;), George Harrison took to his solo career with a passion, writing SO much material, that his 1970 solo debut was a sprawling double-album, and an outstanding one at that, forever cementing the fact that George's songwriting gifts had been sorely underused during his time with the Fab Four (with all due respect to John and Paul). George also brought onboard the legendary Phil Spector to co-produce, and a whole slew of big name musicians to play on the album, such as fellow Beatle Ringo Starr, Eric Clapton, Dave Mason, Procol Harum's Gary Brooker, Alan White (later of Yes), the group Badfinger, Billy Preston, Gary Wright, and many others (including Phil Collins, who plays congas on one track). With so much glorious musical firepower on display, &quot;All Things Must Pass&quot; couldn't fail being a musical home run for the Quiet Beatle. And it most certainly is.   Where to begin the praise for this album? The songs are fantastic. &quot;My Sweet Lord&quot; is George's signature solo song, a timeless, beautiful number. But there's a lot more where that classic song came from: &quot;I'd Have You Anytime,&quot; &quot;Wah Wah,&quot; &quot;Isn't It A Pity,&quot; &quot;What Is Life,&quot; &quot;Let It Down,&quot; &quot;Beware Of Darkness,&quot; the title song, &quot;I Dig Love,&quot; &quot;Art Of Dying,&quot; &quot;Hear Me Lord&quot;....these are all passionate, memorable songs, with George pouring his very heart &amp; soul into every single one of them. His voice and guitar-playing are perfect, the contributions by his all-star session players are superb, and the production by Harrison &amp; Phil &quot;Wall Of Sound&quot; Spector is big and powerful, just like the album itself.Also, for this 30th anniversary re-issue of &quot;All Things Must Pass,&quot; some extra goodies have been included, such as the excellent, previously unreleased song &quot;I Live For You,&quot; a fine re-recording of &quot;My Sweet Lord,&quot; with Harrison joined by his son Dhani on guitar and Sam Brown on vocals, and some extra jam sessions, including the fantastic 11-minute, head-bobbing workout, &quot;Out Of The Blue,&quot; in which Harrison, Clapton &amp; friends jam into pure rock heaven. There's also great new liner notes by Harrison and some very colorful packaging. What more could you possibly want? George Harrison made many wonderful solo albums, including 1987's &quot;Cloud Nine&quot; and his posthumous 2002 release, &quot;Brainwashed,&quot; but &quot;All Things Must Pass&quot; is his masterpiece, an outstanding musical gift with love from the one &amp; only George Harrison. A definite every-home-should-have-one classic.
B00008H2LB|2.0|two words: talent, ingenuity<BR>i used to be a fan of LP till i learnd a little bit on the gitar, then listend to their album again and realized how much this band lacks both of them. <BR>This album shows how overused crappy electronica work can fool you kids into thinking this band can actually play an instrument.<BR>The rock parts are unbeliveably bland, and the rap parts are even blander if that could be at all possible. <BR>Emotion? Hell, any band can make corperatized, recycled and shrink wrapped in FMized lyrics that appeal to gajillion and a half 13 year olds and call it emotional. Phh, i can get more real emotion out of C-SPAN and CNN. This album is bull****
B0001ENYKS|5.0|This is a really good solid cd that takes the classic rock the the 1980's combine it with a tad of queen, and a pinch of country.  Its a really decent album.  The music video definitly plays on the 1980's as being very ackward which is really cool.  I say this is a green light band that should make it to the top.
B00000342V|5.0|I recently purchased this remastered and expanded CD and, to be truthful, had rarely listened to &quot;Superfly&quot; since the movie was released over 30 years ago. I was stunned at how great this music is and what a complete talent Curtis was.<BR>Most importantly, the moral lesson of this drug-adled tale should be taken to heart by all of us, as it certainly doesn't apply to just the African-American community.<BR>Buy this music and spread it around to people,lots of people.
B000002RXS|5.0|This Carmen is absolutely HOT. And Callas sounds great as a mezzom her middle NEVER wobbled. She is the best Carmen ever. And Gedda is just as fabulous. Ignore the ignorant basher &quot;Senza rancor&quot; is writing one star crap on every Callas-recording. He's a heartless, ignorant basher.
B00005NB0H|5.0|For many years I have fought with my music friends about the merits of this recording, since I have always regarded it at the pinnacle of live releases, and many or most of them have not.<BR>There is no question that the DELUXE EDITION is at the very top of live recordings ever made, not because of the sound quality, which is good but not spectacular, but because it captures the legendary band in perfect form. This DELUXE EDITION includes a very large amount of the material that The Who performed live, and is a brilliant sample of the earliest music to &quot;Tommy&quot;.<BR>I now defer to the excellent review by Janson Kemp, and am very content after all these years that others see it my way, or vice versa. I suppose I should have picked better music friends back in 1970, but Who fans were fairly scarce in Northern California back then, and everyone was mostly listening to Zepplin anyway.
B0001LJCPC|5.0|After readnig of all this commentaries I feel relief that i came here. I found answers for many of my questions about the secret songs off Kill Bill Vol. 2 soundtrack. Thank's to you all. But... It's not over yet. Still don't know what is the title of song that is played during the Bill and Budd truck scene. I also have a question about song that nobody ask. When at the beginning of a film Bride is in the wedding chapple and she is after the converstion with Bill... She puts a veil on her head and asks Bill &quot; Do I look pretty?&quot;. What's that song that is played on that scene, and after that on the scene when the Deadly Vipers walk into the church. <BR>Thanks for help. <BR>p.s. I'm from Poland so sorry for my englisch, it's not very good.
B000002OX5|5.0|I bought this album when it first came out and before it ended up in bargain bins all over the country. I will never understand how it received such a poor response in America, but I suppose everyone was too preoccupied with Sergeant Pepper. Do yourself a favor and listen to this masterpiece with headphones. The engineering is excellent, and the thematic approach(one of the first &quot;concept&quot; albums)is absolutely brilliant. If you are my age it is still not too late to discover this music, and if you are young you have a great introduction to the early Who and British Pop aside from the Beatles and Stones and Kinks.
B0000DD7LB|5.0|I love ~*Britney's*~ new CD In The Zone. I listen to it everyday as much as I can (I'm listinin' to it right now!) which is aprx. 6 hrs a day (the rest of the day is taken up by school). The whole CD is great and I love it. Each of the songs on the CD touches my heart, and affects me, each in a very different way. Also since I want to be a singer myself they also inspire me to really write about what I feel in a different way. (some in which I can't explain). I don't know if you know what I mean but it is heard to explain. Here are SOME ways that each of the songs touch my heart, send a message to me, \\"reach me\\", what they do to me and/or how they affect me.<BR>1. Me Against The Music featuring Madonna: This song makes me want to sing, dance, have a good time, sometimes have a good competition, go for what I want, loose control, and get \\"in the zone\\".<br />2. (I Got That) Boom Boom featuring Ying Yang Twins: This song makes me want to sing, dance, have a good time, go and get \\"that guy\\" that I want,and (from some of the lyrics) It makes me feel like, if I want something, to not wait, and to hurry up and get it , because it could be to late.<br />3. Showdown This song makes me want to sing, speak my mind, challenge somebody, resolve any tension I have, and start something all over again.<br />4. Breathe On Me This song makes me want to sing, and Honestly it also makes me wnat to(...)\\"breathe on somebody\\"(...)and(...)um(...)do other things(...)<br />5. Early Mornin' This song makes me want to sing, chill out, call my Boys, Girls, and friends and be like, Hey c'mon let's go somewhere and come back in the early mornin'.<br />6. Toxic This song makes me want to sing , dance, tell a guy how in some ways he can be \\"Toxic\\", and go for a ride in a fast car (convertable) with some of my friends blastin' the music really loud. The song kindof makes me feel likd I'm in amaze, and I can't find my way out untill the end of the song (then I am out of the maze).<br />7. OutrageousThis song makes me want to sing, dance, go my own way, do my own thing, show people how my life is, escape, and go somewhere where everyone understands me.<br />8. Touch Of My Hand This song makes me want to sing, not be afraid to express how I feel, be free, escape, do whatever I want and whatever I feel, let my body mind and imagination take over (me), shut myself out from the world and do things that nobody imagines or expects, (realize) understand the touch of MY hand, \\"look at myself\\", look in the mirror, fly away to my own world, and calm myself.<br />9. The Hook Up This song makes me want to sing, dance, dance really close to somebody, go with the flow, \\"make moves\\", get pumped up, move my body, and \\"get lost dancin\\".<br />10. Shadow This song makes me want to sing, this song gets deep inside me and makes me want to let it all out (in a good way), I can't explain how it makes me feel.<br />11. Brave New Girl This song makes me want to sing, dance, go out with friends, have a good time, hang out, be brave, try new things, go for what I want, get pumped up, jump, and this song gets me hyper.<br />12. Everytime This song makes me want to sing, cry, fly, it takes me away, it makes me feel like I am in heaven, talk about love, it calms me,(I can't explain it)When I listen to this song I litterally \\"freeze\\" up and \\"go somewhere else\\" I go to a place that feels like I'm in heaven.<br />13. Me Against The Music featuring Madonna Rishi Rich's Desi Kulcha Remix Basically the same as Me Against The Music featuring Madonna except in a different way (I can't explain it).
B00005R8FI|5.0|One of the other reviewers calls this album a &quot;timeless classic&quot; and it is. Over the very many years that John Mayall has been making blues music he has developed a reputation as the foremost British interpreter of the guitar/harmonica-based Chicago blues style, and has worked with extradinary musicians (particularly guitarists- Peter Green, Eric Clapton, Mick Taylor, among many others).<BR>This album is all acoustic and it is extradinary. Anyone who thinks only of Mayall's electric approach is missing a real treat here.<BR>Throughout his long and distinguished career John Mayall has been criticized for his vocals, and if you don't like them no one can help you with that. But, regardless, the musicianship on this work is so good, and the spark in the band is so uplifting, that his voice is of secondary concern.<BR>Highly recommended from a long-time blues lover.
B0001UZZWW|1.0|Bundle the Shrek movie with a mini 15 minute DVD.....O.K., I might have bought it because I don't have Shrek on DVD yet.....but, they released it with the Full Screen version!!!! WHY!!!!!!  That was just plain....uhhhh....&quot;DUH&quot;!!!!!  Do they think that they won't make money by selling Shrek 3-D on its own?  Do they just have a stock-pile of Full Screen versions and want to get rid of them?  Why bundle a Full Screen with a Widescreen 3D????  WHY, WHY, WHY????  Sheesh!!!!  Don't waste your time or your money.  Go see the 4D at Universal Studios and enjoy.....or if they sell it seperatly, but chuck this deal where it belongs...in the waste bin until they stop trying to be SO money hungry!!!
B000000OTY|5.0|Take it into your CD player, set ultra-bass and volume to ten... and feel the beat in your stomach...<br />This is, largely, the best Live CD I ever heard, and the reason why I must change frequently my car´s back speakers (hehehe... ;-)<br />From the first track (Come talk to me) to the last one (a wonderful version of &quot;In your eyes&quot;), passing through a joyful &quot;Shaking the tree&quot; and &quot;Kiss that frog&quot;, this album will empower your soul everytime you listen to it.<br />Nice record to get an eternal place in your car (beware from crashing the speakers, you know...)
B0001AP12G|2.0|When I bought this, I expected dope production and an average flow from Kanye.  That's pretty much what I got.  The skits are abit annoying, but it's all part of what he's trying to convey so I can take it.  Kanye is out-preformed by just about every guest on this album(they all give pretty good verses though)  but does have his moments on songs like &quot;two words&quot;, &quot;Jesus Walks&quot; and &quot;Never let me down&quot;.  The album does get a bit monotomous and some songs are just wack (see both &quot;workout plan&quot;). Not a bad debut, but not anything classic.
B0000DJZB9|4.0|First off, this DVD is a great collection of pretty much all of the Guns'n'Roses videos I remember watching on MTV (and &quot;The Garden&quot;...which I don't remember ever seeing, but whatever).  The videos are as amazing now as they were when I was a kid.  &quot;You Could Be Mine&quot; is the only video missing, which I imagine is because it had clips from Terminator 2, and there was probably something about rights.  Anyway, the only really disappointing thing about this collection (which it seems is everyone's peeve with this DVD) is that there are absolutely NO extras on this disc.  No commentaries, no making-of featurettes, not even a still gallery.  Kinda sparse, if you ask me, but you can't argue with Guns 'n' Roses.
1401300901|4.0|Unlike many of the other reviewers, I thought this book was so cute! What an entertaining and fun look into the life of a young lady who thought she had lost it all. With the help of good friends and a thoughtful husband, she was able to live her life again.<br />I thought the plot of this book was so unique and just down right cute. It might not have been very realistic but isn't that what fun books are all about? Letting yourself travel down a road that doesn't exist in real life. It's fun to get away every now and then.<br />I look forward to reading more by Cecelia Ahern!
0316666343|1.0|In her book Alice Sebold preyed on my primitive motherly fear of something happening to my child.  She did this to keep me reading through her mundane, drawn-out, wordy narrative. She could have written this whole story in two chapters, but chose to pull me into her story by fear and then keep me in &quot;reading purgatory&quot; for chapters on end. I read so much waste before I could grab another tiny little morsel of the plot.  I wanted to know what ultimately happened to Susie Salmon and Mr. Harvey.  I found myself reading for the purpose of getting to the end of the book.  When I finally did get to the end, all I could say was &quot;it was a waste of my time.&quot;  Don't read this book...NOT WORTH IT!
B0001GL3KE|2.0|The cast was good,but the acting and storyline was dry.At times I dozed off to sleep or would hit the VCR's fast forward button to find a good scene.If this is suppose to be a comedy it didn't make me laugh.If a future version of this movie is to be made I would urge the writers to make this movie a good one.
B0001IN0DA|5.0|This is by far the best DVD I have ever purchased. The packaging is beautiful, while all of the extras on the DVD are amazing. WWE really outdid themselves this time. Many people have said that the card wasn't that good, but I thought it was one of the best cards in history. This card offered something for everyone. The card featured many different wrestling styles: hardcore, brawling, technical, high flying, slugfest. You name it, it was on this card. All of the matches were good, even Goldberg-Lesnar (i.e. I know the match sucked, and the crowd hated it, but if you watch the match with the volume muted, it is a pretty good match after all :) So, I recommend this to everyone. Get it before they release a sub par version for everyone who didn't get this. Trust me, you will be sorry.
B0000AQS0F|5.0|although sad, this is becoming more and more true.<P>Firefly introduced likable and realistic characters in a sci-fi/western setting. The plots were fun and entertaining. In an era where reality TV is infecting every aspect of the airwaves, there just does not seem to room for quality scripted television. The only draw back to buying this DVD set after you finish watching it you will want to watch more. <P>The only consolation is that Mr. Whedon is currently in the process of bringing the late show to the big screen.
B0001YRVN4|3.0|I don't mind the Special Editions, but I'd prefer the originals. The only thing the REALLY bothers me is that Greedo now shoots first. That not only changes the scene (not too mention how poorly edited it was), but also dimishes Han's character as well.
B000094DUP|5.0|&quot;Innocent Eyes&quot; caught my attention early in 2003, I liked the first single, &quot;Born To Try&quot; and I thought it would be an amazing album, and I was right! It is a great album with a mix of ballads, rock and pop music, it is V E R Y good! It is haunting and amazing at the same time, she has one of the best voiced ive ever heard and the songwriting is nice too, I have compiled the Achievment INNOCENT EYES has accomplished In Australia and NZ:<br />&quot;Born To Try&quot;,#1 in Australia and New Zealand and multi-platinum<br />&quot;Lost Without You&quot;, #1 In Australia, #4 in New Zealand and Gold/ multi-platinum<br />&quot;Innocent Eyes&quot;, #1 in Australia (multi-platinum), #12 in New Zealand.<br />&quot;Not Me, Not I&quot; #1 in Australia and kicked Dido off the #1 spot (mulit-platinum), #18 in New zealand<br />&quot;Predictable&quot;, #1 In Australia (multi platinum), not in NZ Charts yet.
B0001AP12G|5.0|Aw man, this CD is excellent, and im not just saying that because Kanye West is from my city. I mean the beats the words, his flows, his everything, its a classic when it comes to Hip-Hop. He punches you with the beats, sticks it to you with his words, and he tops it off with his skits and his own distinction. Unlike some of the rappers today, he doesnt rap all about being rich or being made out of gold. He talks about everything in his life that got him this far, and how sometimes you got to pay the price. It really contributes to Hip-Hop and it really takes a step forward in the industry, i just hope more Rappers like him come out with more true rhymes, than talking about just shooting guns and selling drugs. And some of my favorite rappers of all time are on this CD, Talib Kweli, Mos Def, Common, Jay-Z, Ludacris, Kanye balances his CD well. I strongly recommend this CD for anyone who truly loves Hip-Hop and its very refreshing and raw to see a rapper like this, who hasn't come out in a long time.
0345452577|1.0|I too have been a great Kellerman fan, and have read all his books. But this one is bad, and not just because it isn't Alex Delaware or because it has little if any real plot.  It's the style, something I don't remember from the earlier books.  One reader noticed the annoying short chapters, a trend from some other \\"thriller\\" writers.<br />What I noticed was the page after page of one sentence paragraphs.<br />Or one phrase paragraphs.<br />Supposed to make us feel breathless, I guess.<br />But really more like [Dick and Jane].
0446677450|5.0|I am 22 years old and I felt that with our ever-changing world of business, wealth and finance that I needed to read this book. I was recommended this by a friend. Although this is controversial among most people, Kiyosaki gives you his thoughts about how he did it and what the reader shall do. This book does not guarantee the reader will get rich, but offers some great ideas (you'll just have to read on!). I was very touched by some of the points that he gave. <br />Okay, now for my gut-spilling: There is speculation stating whether Rich Dad exists. Whether or not he does, this book should still help out the individual! And some believe Kiyosaki is involved with controversial businesses like Amway. Who the heck cares? That is his business, and it doesn't have to be yours. After all, it's not even mentioned in the book.
B0001BKAEY|4.0|The graphics and action sequences were awsome however the screen play was lacking.The ending was weak.
B00009W0WM|5.0|I just love this movie. I am a huge fan of the Not so happy ending. Imperfect love is the best kind. Oh and I am a sappy romantic with a morbid side.
B00004TJKI|5.0|This tense courtroom drama combines elements of suspense, sensuality, comedy, and intellect to deliver a wonderfully captivating film. The characters are the driving force of this film, with James Stewart obviously leading the cast as defense attorney Paul Biegler. Lee Remick is perfect in the role of flirtatious, sexy, lower-class blond Laura Manion, whose husband murdered the man who raped her. Ben Gazzara plays Frederick Manion, who pleads temporary insanity to the murder, although both Stewart and the audience know his crime was quite deliberate. George C. Scott delivers a cutting performance as the big-city lawyer who lashes into Manion, only to have Manion lash back. Eve Arden plays Biegler's loyal secretary, and Arthur O'Connell rounds out the cast as Biegler's alcoholic friend. <br />Unlike many Hollywood courtroom dramas that FEEL like Hollywood courtroom dramas, this film possesses a realism that most others lack. The film was very controversial at the time of its 1959 release because of the \\"graphic\\" descriptions of the rape. I find trivia like this especially interesting because it helps me see the evolution of film over the decades. I love movies that strive for elements of realism; however, I hate contemporary films that feel compelled to shock audiences beyond belief in their \\"realism.\\" This film accomplishes that goal without the grotesque and obscene style of many of today's courtroom dramas. <br />Overall, this is a wonderful piece of cinematic art with top-notch writing and characterization. A must-see for any film aficionado.
B00004TA41|4.0|Coltrane's last phase is not my favorite, but I think I have found how to listen to these recordings.  They obviously don't function as background music, and active listening is also difficult, since there are no chord changes or melody (in any traditional sense) to follow.  But if I close my eyes and relax, let the music wash over me, sort of like looking at those 3-D images where you want to unfocus your eyes, this turbulent music makes me very calm.  While it's the polar opposite of new age music, I find the music to be meditative.
B000084T18|3.0|Alright so this ain't the best CD for me of the year, but it's worth a listen.

B000002JPA|4.0|This is NOT Dream Theater's best album. I rely on the Prog People of the universe for some reasoning and understanding when there are endless seas of the Teeny Bopper People to be content on the surface. But I guess even in the most intuitive minds, nostalgia is a big force and I'm not old enough to understand it yet. That said, allow an &quot;outsider&quot; to point something out: &quot;Dark Side of the Moon,&quot; &quot;Appetite for Destruction,&quot; and &quot;Slippery When Wet&quot; were and are all phenomenal albums, but joining the ranks is &quot;Images and Words,&quot; in that earlier isn't always better. In the non-mainstream world of DT, &quot;Images and Words&quot; was their &quot;Breakthrough,&quot; just as &quot;Appetite...&quot; was, in the mainstream for GNR. Great albums like this one deserve praise and timelessness, that's a given for me, but I don't think one must have to be that openminded to see that breakthrough albums are what they are; HUGE openings of gates or windows or pick your own metaphor(s) that begin the hopeful path to evolution and progress.<br />So I've explained why I felt the need to take away a star, but now let's go to work and justify the presence of the other 4.<br />First off, if it weren't for an AMAZING track called &quot;Metropolis 1&quot;, the fate of DT's BEST album and quasi-sequel to it (that should be enough hinting) later down the road might not have been the same. With such jawdropping rhythmic motives and glorious intrumental breaks, all stampeding up towards the last crashing climax, there's really no words I can think of to describe it.<br />&quot;Take the Time&quot; is very complex (what isn't here) but the instrumental melody and jam progression (E-F#-A-C-D-E) towards the end is the embryo of what the Theater would be striving for over the next decade - GROOVE AND FEEL! There's more in the later albums, but most of &quot;Take the Time&quot; reveals John Petrucci's Godlike ability to play the most technically proficient passages WHILE maintaining emotion.<br />&quot;Another Day&quot; is one of my favorites as it is slower and thus these manmachines of prog let their brains calm down a bit. Result: taste. James has some very poignant vocals as well.<br />And of course the star of the show, &quot;Pull Me Under.&quot; Which to this day doesn't make sense to me why that song seemed to grab the prog market that it did. It IS a good song... but that song is one of the least prog songs they have, which is probably why, coupled with many edits, they were able to get it on MTV a little bit. Still I've heard many say they've never heard anything like &quot;Pull Me Under&quot; at the time, and it sounds very Megadeth/Metallica to me, almost Pantera!. Which isn't a bad thing, let me add. Indeed, though &quot;Images and Words&quot; IS a great album and it has more &quot;up&quot; moments than &quot;down&quot; moments, it isn't as original and creative as 1) everyone gives it credit for and 2) Dream Theater would soon become. The triggering and processing on the snare puts a bit of a dated sound to the experience as well, I might add. But nobody in their right mind can listen to this album and knock them down for a lack of effort.<br />I advise purchasing their entire catalog, as every album has its own character to offer, but it is always Dream Theater. That's what's so great about this band. Well, the fact that their playing can blow anyone else who comes within 50 feet of a guitar off of the planet doesn't hurt either.
B00004VXF2|5.0|The only reason Lou Reed made this record was to give smack heads something to listen to while they were &quot;feeling like jesus son&quot;. If you look at the heroin references Lou draws on in the liner notes he points out that it was not a record for parties and that at the very least he had now something to listen to.  MMM has to be the ultimate smack record. What else can you do with it but use it as a soundtrack for a head rush. At least Lou can say that nobody else in the entire music business who had already achieved his level of critical acclaim had the balls to make a record like this.
B00005JLKB|4.0|I got hooked on this show by accident.<BR>I always heard about it but never made an attempt to watch it because it was on the WB and most of the shows on this network are similar to one another in terms of good looking people fighting over who wants to get the cute girl or guy. I also thought Smallville was about a dude controlling or interacting with aliens (like X-files or something)...then the more episodes I watched the more it started to make sense. I was a fan!<br />I had to get the box set because I had to watch everything from the beginning. Every single episode is EXCITING! None boring. Tom Welling does this role great...I actually feel for his character Clark when his powers become a little overwhelming to handle at times and he wishes he was normal and didn't have to hide. Clark is every woman's dream with the sensitivity issue...he says all the right things...the woman are already feeling him on that...why can't they find him a girl though to hold him over til Lois Lane? We all know that he doesn't end up with Lana in the end plus The Cat and mouse thing with Lana gets a bit tired at times. I can bet if the series goes to Metropolis when Clark is all grown up....guess who will play Lois? Kristin Kreuk.<br />Everyone does great in this series especially Michael Rosenbaum as Lex, I actually felt sorry for Lex at times because he too has tons of issues, half the time he is lonely and drinking some sort of alchohol beverage or driving around in the latest sports car...filling this void, you almost wish he never turns into THE Lex Luthor...but just like Anaken SkyWalker in Star Wars episode II who turns into the Evil Darth Vader Lex changes too...sadly...his character is very likable, most of the times he means well but it just ends up looking bad for him no matter what he does.<br />I haven't seen season 2 yet (awaiting it's arrival to purchase it) The season one price was a bit high but definitely worth it though, bonuses, interactivity, it's great, recommended. The only CREATIVE series left on TV.
0312995423|1.0|I would put down &quot;No Stars&quot; as I thought the book was that poorly written.  If someone gives you this book to read, GIVE IT BACK.  Slow char development, it does not move smoothly through the book, clumsy writting.  I thought I was reading a book written by a romance novelist and had to check three times that it was actually a man that had written the book.
B0001Z53AQ|1.0|Yet again another musical &quot;spin-off&quot; of a popular rapper. This formula hasn't worked in years; I have yet to see a famous rapper's crew do good or just as good as he or she.<BR>Nelly's the St.Lunatics haven't done it, Timbaland's &quot;Timbaland and Magoo&quot; hasn't done it....No matter how many times Busta Rhymes screams and force feeds us &quot;Flipmode Squad&quot; no one cares.<BR>And the list goes on and on.<BR>Every single time I turn on MTV or MTV 2 it's constantly &quot;EM TV&quot; featuring D-12 or it's about D-12 as if the group deserves that much exposure and time for a totally WACK album!<BR>No one in the group stands out from one another in the rapping department, the fat dude seems like he is a constant punchline (and that's it) These guys could be on MTV 2 100 times a week and if they were to walk down the street without Eminem know one would know who the heck they are...nor care.<BR>I heard this album in Virgin Mega store for free and I am sooooo glad I didn't buy it.<BR>The beats were wack, half the time it sounded like a hidden parody going on that we have no idea about.<BR>The subject matter seems to be more important to them than to us.<BR>Even their first album &quot;Devil's night&quot; sounded much better and that wasn't all that great but I took it more serious.<BR>I think D-12 would be more suited to an MTV reality show or something because I can see them being interesting in that sense but them rapping seems more like &quot;well my homeboy is Eminem he got dough and he put us on&quot;<br />Please no more D-12 albums after this, or just do like Prince did...put terrible albums out until your record label drops you. Eminem's right &quot;we don't know the name of your band...you're wack&quot;. You're better off renting this CD at your local library if you're still curious.

1561006742|3.0|I thought the picture of Dorian Gray was ok. There were some parts that I was confused with and some parts I did not like. It is about a man named Dorian Gray who asks for his portrait to be done. His friend Basil Hallward does his portrait. When he recieves it he wishes he could always be beautiful. He is this really handsome guy. So he gave away his soul in order to have eternal youth,so no matter what happened nothing would happen to him and the portrait would grow old instead. Later he goes insane and kills... In between these confusing times he still has a normal life at the same time. He is engaged to a girl but she commits suicide. He has this good friend named Lord Henry. Lord Henry helps teach him how to have emotions and he teaches him about life. Sometimes it is really confusing advice. He even throws parties. Then Dorian's engaged person's brother is seeking revenge and tries to kill him but is accidentely shot; but how?  Then he is tired of having eternal youth so he...  You will have to find out what hapens to him.
B000002AEN|5.0|This cd has a variety it is no doubt blues, however Hurt is more versitile then just a blues singer, he is a masterful guitar player, who picks ragtime melodies, and sings folksy style, while gently rocking both vocally and instrumentaly.<br />Hurt was ahead of his time by 30 years, before the folk music scene was huge in the 60's, also he was looking back 20 years to the 1910's and ragtime.  An interesting mix 1n 1928 lookin to the past and the future ta make some great original and truly unique and from the heart warming blues.<br />An essential cd is the bottom line
B00006IUL7|3.0|Insomnia was a rip off of a great foreign movie.  The two versions of the story are nowhere near equal.  The original release was edgy and really let the viewers get into the mind of the characters portrayed and all of their internal struggles.  The Hollywood version never reached the same level of suspense and the characters never seemed as convincing as in the original.  So, if you don't mind reading subtitles, do yourself a favor and pick up the original instead.
B0001US8FI|5.0|Finally somebody did a Bruce Lee dvd justice. I was very happy to watch the special features of this film. I own the box set of all his Chinese films. Including the horrible Game of death. (except for the last sequence) Now you can see what Bruce Lee wanted for that film. Anyone who is a fan of martial arts needs this. The intense realistic action is not seen much in hong kong cinema. Do not buy the regular version to save cash, this one is much better.
B0001VTPWM|5.0|What else can you say about the Robocop series except... WOW!<BR>The Lord of the Rings movies? The Original Star Wars trilogy? The Godfather saga? The James Bond films? They all look like the Police Academy series compared to The Robocop franchise! Robocop burst onto the movie scene in the 1980's and the film world has never been the same. Robocop revolutionized the way people looked at sci-fi cinema. It blazed a new trail in special effects, direction, editing, storytelling, and acting. Robocop tells the Story of Murphy, a cop who is nearly killed only to come back as: ROBOCOP. Half robot, half cop, Murphy (now Robocop) comes back to deal out death and destruction (not to mention JUSTICE! ) to those that prey on the innocent. Not since Charles Bronson kicked bad-guy butt in the Death Wish movies has such an awesome hero graced the movie screen. The best thing about the Robocop movies is that unlike most movie series, such as the Lord of the Rings films, thes movies actually got BETTER with each film. Robocop 3 is easily one of the best three-quels of all time. So, the next time you're sad or depressed, or just want to see some of the best Science Fiction/Action-Adventure movies of all time pick up this dvd set and watch yourself some... Robocop!!!!!!!!
B00004YZFR|5.0|THIS IS A GREAT DVD FROM ONE OF THE GREATEST ROCK BANDS EVER.HIGHLY RECOMMENDED.
B000148KK2|4.0|To all those reviewers who have panned this CD because it is so different from her earlier efforts: get over it!  Musicians (like all artists) grow and change in their artistic endeavors.  Diana Krall started out as ONLY a (marvelously gifted) jazz pianist when she was a teenager, and her vocal talents were added later, in her twenties.  Now that she is 39 (which is hard to fathom), she deserves the chance to grow and try new things.<br />Her usual stock-in-trade, jazz standards, are basically missing here.  The few &quot;standards&quot; she does include are from a rather different group of songwriters (Joni Mitchell, Tom Waits...).  But in most of the songs, Ms. Krall herself has composed the music, while the lyrics are mostly collaborations between her and her husband Elvis Costello.<br />Musically, the thing that strikes me the most on this recording is that her singing is much more in the forefront.  Her (excellent) piano playing does come out on occasion, but she generally uses it mostly as accompaniment to her singing.  And this is her first recording featuring her own compositions, making for additional avenues to explore.<br />I think that the negative reviews here are primarily to do with the fact that she has departed from her standard repertoire.  Her musicianship still shines thru, albeit in a different light.  The variety of the content of the lyrics allow her to explore nuances of singing that are fresh and interesting.  <br />I must admit that at first, I was disappointed with the change in repertoire and the de-emphasizing of her piano playing.  However, the recording has grown on me.  It's not yet one of my favorites, but very well might turn out that way.
B000000W5L|5.0|THIS WAS A NICE CD FROM THE ROLLING STONES WHICH GOT OVERSHADOWED BY THE BRILLIANT BEGGARS BANQUET AND LET IT BLEED ALBUMS.I LIKE THIS CD ALONG WITH STICKY FINGERS AND WOULD RECOMMENDED THIS AWESOME CD TO EVERYONE.VERY HIGHLY RECOMMENDED.
0312319517|5.0|Do you really know what happened between 1995 and sept 10 2001.<br />As many the books of FF you will never know if this book is real or not, but what you will really know is that you could not leave the book until the end, it has two or three things about Vietnam that are really ugly, but the way that FF writes is unique and no matter how ugly he describes the things that happened, you will read them.<br />The story of the avenger is sad, as all the avengers, but real good, since Vietnam till the end of the book, the story of the rest of the characters is good but not as good as the avenger.
B00008CLOA|5.0|THIS IS ONE OF THE GREATEST MUSIC CD'S EVER MADE WHICH HAS STOOD THE TEST OF TIME VERY WELL AND REMAINED IN THE CHARTS FOR A RECORD 10 YEARS IN A ROW SELLING AROUND 30 MILLION ALBUMS WORLD WIDE.VERY HIGHLY RECOMMENDED.
B0000VAFO0|5.0|Blade was interesting, but to me it failed emotionally.  You just do not connect with the film on the personal level.  The effects were super, but that was the main impact...\\"wow what amazing effects\\".  You feel like breaking out in a chorus of Peggy Lee's Is That All There Is.  Special effects alone cannot make a movie great.<br />Underworld makes that jump, great FX work, but also gives you characters you really care about, ones that you really love to hate.  A strong plot line designed to hook you and keep you, just does that.  With the emotional involvement, there is a greater impact, a movie that will demand repeat viewing.  Instant Cult Status.  <br />The movie grabs you from the opening and never lets up with the pace.  Firm direction and with a driving score, the movie reaches for perfection.  You have a 1000-year-old war between Lycons and Vampires, and it's all coming to a head.  It's a well thought out and executed premise and Kate Beckinsale shines!  She is an amazing talent.  I first adored her work in Cold Comfort Farm as Robert Post's child Flora.  When you compare that gentle, deft bit of humor with this kick a*** vampire hunter, it proves what an overlooked talent she is.  With Van Helsing out now (and I am sure this movie led to her landing the role), she is finally getting a spotlight she so well deserves.<br />A gloomy, atmospheric ambiance to the whole movie is maintained all the way through, adding a strong foundation for the otherworld premise.  I am sure some will nitpick things, as all vampire film faces, but kudos for the vibrant energy and sheer edgy feel to the film. <br />It leaves you hanging, clearly open for a sequel...one can but hope it maintains this high quality.<br />Kate rocks...you don't need to know anymore!
B00006CXXU|5.0|What I can say about this album is that it's just perfect, every song, the art design, everything, standouts for me are: Walk away, The Voice Within, Soar, I'm OK, Fighter.<br />The best album I've every buy.
B00000099Y|5.0|If you dont believe this is best album ever created, you are either incredibly ignorant or deaf (no offence meant) <br />If you are reading reviews before listening to it, STOP NOW! get off your @$$ and spend the money now, the only way to even get close to describing it to actually sit by yourself and relax and keep a very open mind, and let the music flow into your soul. <br />Tool are not merely a band, but a spiritual guide, and there music can provide guidance in many aspects of life, with its thought provoking, emotional, journey from start to finish, <br />No bad Tool song exists, every one has been meticulously but together, if you knew anything about critical analysis you'd have noticed this, <br />It probably will not appeal to most &quot;gun-toting hip-gangster wannabes&quot; but hey lets keep the music to those who appreciate it. (offence meant to all &quot;gun-toting hip-gangster wannabes&quot; - sort it out people)
B00009V7RF|1.0|This is absolute junk, if you look up &quot;sell out&quot; in the dictionary there'll be a picture of &quot;the black eyed peas&quot;.  It started with the Dr. Pepper commercial, then this horrible album came out.  They actually went out and acquired a model to lip sync/dance and show off her body.  Then there's the nba playoffs commercial, xm radio commercial, and the garfield movie commercial.  I'm just saying that I'm completely disappointed, their first two albums were amazing, and then they come out with this.  It's too bad and money can ruin people like this.
B000062YB1|5.0|Awesome solos, overall outstanding song quality and some of the best riffs Slayer has to showcase. Yes it is better than Reign In Blood and it's more technical than most of Slayer's releases. Perhaps Slayer's best, it still has some stiff competition in Haunting the Chapel and Hell Awaits. Every song is awesome and the solos here are probably the best Slayer have ever done. This cd couldve been done today, the production is MUCH better then Reign In Blood, you can actually hear the bass drums properly and it still keeps a raw charm. Dave Lombardo was never my favourite drummer, I happen to believe Paul Bostaph is much better but he deliver a solid performance here, I love the fills, but everything else isn't stand out stuff in terms of rhythm.<br />Guitar riffs are awesome, Jeff and Kerry really are some of the best guitarists metal has ever seen, and, as I said before, the solos are damn fantastic. Their songwriting is really something to look up to.<br />Bass is nice and thick, but Tom's real performance is his vocals on this cd. His voice is at its peak at the recording time for this album, although he doesn't do any more of his loud, long, high-pitched, falsetto screams like at the start of Angel of Death.<br />Overall, if you're new to Slayer, start anywhere, 'cause they're ALL good. I didn't give this album an easy 5 stars, it's earnt it. Buy it if you haven't got it, no regrets from here!
6305907145|1.0|I love Jane Austen books and all the other movies based on her books that I have seen.  This, however, is not only not even remotely true to the book, it's a pretentious, pompous, anachronistic movie that I cannot recommend to anyone. I don't know what the screenwriter was thinking, aside from the fact that he needed to belittle the values of the time by weakly justifying all the book's antagonists with anachronistic 'he was forced into it' pseudo-explanations, and weakening the strong characters with completely speculative and blown out of proportion modern-day sins, making the movie not a period piece, but a pompous and preachy modern-day tale dressed in Georgian garb.  Also, when viewing a Jane Austen adaptation, one rarely expects to see frontal nudity, another misplaced and anachronistic piece that I found highly distasteful.  If you scorn the values and history of the society that Jane Austen expressed in her writing, you will love this movie.  Its goal is more mockery and disrespect than anything honoring Austen's work or ideas -- many have said that the screenwriter has a right to adapt how she wants to, but why make a movie off a book you so obviously dislike and want to completely change?  I can see only 3 reasons: 1) marketing to an audience on a false pretense, getting many viewers who would not normally pay to see the movie (though this will eventually breed more contempt for the movie, from misled viewers) 2) a cocky need to preach against the very values cherished by the fans of the original work, or 3) wanting to seem 'innovative' when the ideas you actually want to get across would be completely bland and trite in the modern slew of PC-movie-preaching.  Ick.
B00006JJ1O|4.0|...they chose the WRONG Smiths song to cover.  Everybody and their grandma covers \\"How Soon is Now?\\"  It's become the \\"Stairway to Heaven\\" of its generation.  What they SHOULD have covered was \\"Sheila Take a Bow,\\" a sweet li'l ol' courtship song for androgynes of uncertain sexual persuasion.  For a bonus, Yulia Volkova (The Noisy One) could cover \\"Bigmouth Strikes Again!\\" ;-)<br />It's a shame the act is self-destructing.  Under better management, and more jovial songs to balance out the \\"I'd DIE without you!\\" theme off the album, they could have been a cooler version of the Village People.  They'd have been the toast of the club circuit!  Unfortunately, their manager was an eejit. <br />Now if I was managing that act, I'd have them do a disco-opera about Original Gangsta Lesbian Poetess Sappho!  (Bulb lights up!  Me Am Hulk starts writing the libretto...)
B0000CDLA7|3.0|Dream Theater have long been dubbed Progressive Metal. They have a huge following of both prog-heads and metalheads plus anyone else in between. Throughout their career, they've had metal influences on every album (even Falling Into Infinity). However, there has always been a debate about whether or not they are truly metal. After all, they've done just as many ballads as they have metal tracks and their most revered work is really progressive rock with a modern, heavy sound (could Change Of Seasons or Learning To Live really be classed as metal?). Taking a look at their work, it could be argued that Dream Theater have straddled the line between metal and rock when it came to their brand of prog.<br />Until now that is.<br />Train Of Thought is without a doubt a metal album, and the heaviest they've done so far. Only one of these tracks is not metal (Vacant): the others are heavy, technical, fast and, well, metal. I showed Honour Thy Father to a friend of mine who'd heard very little Dream Theater and he was waiting for the growling to kick in! Sounds to you like the Dream Theater of old? No, I didn't think so.<br />However, time has taken its toll (which considering I bought this almost as soon as it came out) and I find that I rarely listen to this album. And when I do put it on, I'm not left in awe like I am with most other Dream Theater albums. The problem is that the album is a mish-mash of heavy riffs and fast solos, which doesn't make a great album alone. The instrumental sections here are very uninventive and seem technical for the sake of it. Myung is barely heard at all (even less so than on previous albums), Petrucci and Rudess failed to create a genuinely memorable solo, Portnoy's drumming seems to be lacking in creativity. The only member on fire is LaBrie, who I think sounds really good, especially considering that his voice isn't really suited for music this heavy.<br />The band really need an outside producer. True, they struck gold with Scenes From A Memory (although I felt that even that had its down points), but both this and Six Degrees Of Inner Turbulance have a cliched prog metal sound with little attention to detail. Petrucci needs to be told when to slow down (not a problem in the past), Rudess needs to be told when his patches sound like something out of a video game and the band generally need to be told that cutting and pasting riffs does not make great music. But most importantly, they need someone who can create a wondorful sound from the music made (rather than a cliched, overdone sound), something that Portnoy and Petrucci can't do themselves.<br />Some have slated this because it is heavy. That's certainly not the problem I have with it. The problem I have with it is far worse - that it signifies a real drop in creativity that dominates this band's earlier material. After listening to creative works such as Learning To Live, A Change Of Seasons, Home, Voices or Metropolis Part 1, I know that Dream Theater are capable of much more inventive and varied music devoid of the musical masturbation I hear here. I'd be lying if I said I didn't like it at all, this much is true. But if you're not already into Dream Theater then buy Images And Words, Awake or Scenes From A Memory first. If you're a metalhead, I still wouldn't recommend this to start off with despite it being their heaviest album.A Memory (although I felt that even that had its down points), but both this and Six Degrees Of Inner Turbulance have a cliched prog metal sound with little attention to detail.

B00007LTIL|5.0|So what if the Grateful Dead (or the entire decade of the 70's for that matter) never got better than this.  American Beauty along with Workingman's Dead are astonishing works of sonic bliss.  And to think they were both released in the same year, 1970.  To listen in 2004 is to marvel; this album will cure your ills without any side-effects (except for chronic smiling).
6305428425|5.0|Wassup this movie is master genious of the comedy.  How can a movie reminisce the 80's without getting to much into cliches, well watch &quot;Romy and Michele's High School Reunion&quot; and u will find out how, this movie has it all, fun, great comedy, great jokes, and superb actings by Lisa Kudrow and Mira Sorvino, a classic and a guilty pleasure.

B00005JM02|5.0|A movie that you can watch over and over again...most parents know some children's movies are so poorly written that it can drive you batty and up the wall! This one will not dissappoint you. &quot;Finding Nemo&quot; is not only entertaining, it also has life's lessons and teaches values to kids. I will go as far as to say that some grown-ups (who don't have any kids)need to watch this!
1586215817|5.0|This abridged adaption of the novel, expertly read, as always, by Ron McClarty, is a well written story of assassination, intrigue, suspense, and strong characters.  It begins with a political assassination and ends with a betrayal; beyond that, I don't want to give the plot away.  Suffice it to say, that Mr. Baldacci's characters are strong, whether good or bad, and Sidney Morse is as about an evil so and so as one might find.  Sean King, Michelle Maxwell, and Joan Dillinger (which made me chuckle a little, as I thought it was a play the name &quot;John Dillinger&quot;, but it probably wasn't) were all strong, complex, characters.  With a tight story and as mentioned an excellent reading by Mr. McClarty, I found the story quite suspenseful.  It might make an excellent movie, if done right; which, unfortunately, many books are not.  Even so, I think readers will enjoy the story.  If one is a fan, as I am, of Mr. Baldacci's work, and I have everything, short of his new book; which hasn't been published, but rest assured, when it is I'll get it, you'll like this story.  While Mr. Baldacci doesn't get the &quot;automatic&quot; movie and television deals of a John Grisham, his work (I think) is much better.  I have written him, on his site, so.  I will definitely be picking up the print version (as well as the audio version, if still in print, around the holidays, of &quot;The Christmas Train&quot;).
B00019PDKC|4.0|i think i spelt &quot;mystifying&quot; wrong. but that's how i describe this album. i actually came to own it by accident. i left my radio at school and someone left the cd in it. now i love it. it's a pretty good listen.
B000000WZ4|4.0|After four years of patient waiting and two of patient making, this is another controversial album, although as critics liked to point out: a miracle it ever saw the light. You see, this is the period when Dave became a drug addict, and as has often been hinted, the other members had a few problems themselves. Stability wasn't the thing that came out from the Songs Of Faith And Devotion album and tour. Nowadays they even remember those two years as the worst in their lives.<br />Anyway, they made it. And it is true that it is almost enough. Ultra is much, much better than the band splitting. But as the all-new album after four years of silence, it could have been better.<br />I think, and this fans could argue for hours, that it doesn't reach the previous album's height. But it still offers some really good songs. Let's see.<br />Barrel Of A Gun, the first single (released a few months before the album) is a great forerunner. The conflict, the emptiness, a sense of obscurity taking over, and finally, not redemption (as in Songs...) but resignation. Dave's rough vocals and the heaviest guitar sounds they have ever recorded find their way over some synthesiser layers, and programmed drums that sound like what The Cure is up to these days (they even recorded a cover of World In My Eyes for the tribute album Various Artists For The Masses). On a side note, the song's video, directed by Anton Corbijn as usual, is a true masterpiece.<br />Home, the third single is another Martin Gore vocals great standard. A critic once labelled it the best DM single of all time. I don't think that is necessarily true, but we are still left with a beautiful song. The variations in the melody (singing to fourths and thirds) get the very interesting hook of building to a fifth and then to an augmented fifth, this modelling a song with no precedent in their back catalogue. It is also, the other great video, a la Wenders, for this album.<br />Uselink and The Jazz Thieves are instrumental pastiches. Not bad as short musical passages between the songs, but they shouldn't be listed as songs. The second one is the most odd of the couple, with Martin's very own weird jazz sense.<br />Useless is the kind of song that you love and hate, both things at the same time. It could have been one of the greatest, but although still good (and for me reminiscent of A Question Of Time) it lacks refinement. The single version works a little better, adding some very welcomed percussion and keyboard layers. But the one on the album, being a hard rock with simplest drum patterns and heavy distorted guitar riff, lacks some final production. Bass is really good in the song, though, recorded by ex-Living Colour bassist. Dave sings a difficult but well worked out melody, with Martin singing background to get things higher. Also, very weird and not entirely convincing is the grunge guitar fill-in, mostly at the end when it repeats over the vocals.<br />Freestate is a nice number, with very interesting guitar work by Martin. Sister Of Night being the most typically approached song goes from an opening reminiscent of Kaleid (Policy Of Truth's b-side) to a fragile ballad. Here Dave's vocals turn all soft and warm beginning what seems to be the singing style he will adopt in the future. <br />The Bottom Line is a great song on the album, being Martin's other take on vocals. Here he goes for a lower tone that still showcases his beautiful voice singing some of the best lines in the album [Like a pawn on the eternal board / Who's never quite sure what he's moved towards / I walk blindly on ] accompanied by Bj Cole's masterful guitar work (for quick reference listen to Roger Water's Amused To Death, also featuring Bj).<br />Insight, the final song (though final number is the hidden Painkiller Jr, a not-so-interesting reworking of Barrel Of A Gun's b-side) is a nice closing tune. Dave's vocals are all surrounded by Martin's own, in a sweet arrange that breaks in the colder, stronger andmore typical chorus. Still a good counterpart, not quite a great song in itself.<br />There are two other songs, far weaker than the rest: The Love Thieves and It's No Good. The first one is a peaceful attempt but not a complete song in the way it's been produced. You see, a great verse flowing to an absolute dead chorus with no emotional factor whatsoever and lacking any sense of why it should be that way. And the second one, also the second single, is typical DM hit that doesn't show in any way what the band is all about. It sounds good, that's true. But the basic premise, as well as the obvious chorus make it a song that belongs to the past and should not have been in the same album that features Barrel Of A Gun, Home or The Bottom Line.<br />The conclusion: it's not USELESS and it certainly isn't a NO-GOOD. THE BOTTOM LINE: offers some INSIGHT into the band's recovering phase and ultimate quest for HOME.
B000002H2H|5.0|This is Metallica's best album, in my opinion. Compared to Load and Reload, which SUCK (come to think of it, so do Garage, the black album and St. Anger)its the bestest and they barely sound like the same band. <br />Fight Fire with Fire - very scary, about the end of the world which is so scary but also awesome... i like how it starts out quiet but ends up really really really loud!<br />Ride the Lightning - solo is okay, like the about to die thing.<br />For Whom the Bell Tolls - intro awesome. I like the message, especially the line &quot;for a hill men would kill, why they do not know&quot;<br />Fade to Black - this is like the best song ever! It's awesome because its really slow and sad and about suicide but the guitar is still awesome, both the acoustic and the other one sometimes int he backround.<br />Trapped Under Ice - again, the dying thing is very interesting. awesome song!<br />Escape - very good, just haven't listened to this one in awhile, hee hee<br />Creeping Death - awesome!!!! i especially love the part where they scream &quot;die by my hand...&quot; i hope when i see them live they do that because it sounds really good very, very, very loud.<br />The Call of Ktulu - am I supposed to know what &quot;ktulu&quot; is???? their best instrumental!!<br />make sure you listen to this album really loud. it's their best. i wish burton wasn't dead.
6305537321|5.0|I have always loved Audrey Hepburn ever since I first learned about her when I was about 9 or 10 years old.I have seen all of her movies,and this by far is her greatest one.As a matter of fact,I think this movie is the greatest of all time!Ok,ok,a little exaggerated,but it is my personal favorite of all time.Audrey Hepburn is simply amazing in this movie as ditzy but loveable hooker(yes,hooker) Holly Golightly,whom is one of the greatest movie characters in movie history,in my book.Audrey conatins so much charm in this movie and really is the best known Audrey Hepburn. movie.And George Burns has amazing charisma and chemistry with Audrey as aspiring writer Paul Zarjak,who Holly nicknames as her borther Fred since she thinks they have a resemblance.And the supporting cast is great,too,especially Mickey Rooney's hilarious part as Mr?,Holly's Asian naighbor,which some people might find offensive,but is still very funny.In fact,the whole movie is hilarious,one example being the side-splitting scene where Holly drinks herself under the table(no,not literally!).But,this isn't all laughs,some of this movie is so heartbreaking and tearjerking that you can't help but take out the Kleenex box,especially when Holly gets the message after going out with the Brazilian millionaire that her brother,Fred...(when you see the movie,you'll know what I'm talking about.)But,above all of this,the movie is so romantic that you'll wanna get married faster than you can say &quot;Holly Golightly&quot;!Sure,Holly&amp;Paul's relationship gets a few speed bumps along the way(Audrey dating a Brazilian millionaire),but over all of it,they triumph,making this movie one of the greatest,if not,the greatest romantic comedy of all time,and then some.And,the fact that Audrey's character,Holly,plays hard-to-get for such a long time makes this a serious comedy,and not just a big piece of fun.Although I could never figure out why Holly would want to date anyone that looks like her btother,but then I realize that true love is true love and nothing can break it,and it's all thanks to this masterpiece.Oh,and the little black dress,simply amazing(sorry,I just had to add that!)!<br />The Verdict:Like I Said,One Of The Greatest Movies In History Starring One Of The Greatest Actresses That Ever Lived.<br />Recommended:Of Course!
B000060P79|4.0|First of all, I would like start by saying these guys are pop. Yeah, I admitted it! And normally I hate pop, so why 4 stars? Because it's catchy, because it's fun, and because it's simple. Second of all, I'd like to let the people posting 1-star reviews and telling others it sucks ass and such, to stop preaching to the wrong crowd. No one's really listening to you... sorry. But go away, please.<br />Simple Plan are nowhere near my favorite band, but they are good. They make a lot of catchy songs, and I have the Australian version of the CD, so it's got two bonus tracks (ever heard the song One By One?) and it makes it a lot better. Simple Plan do have the occasional ballad-type song (Meet You There, Perfect) but it isn't unbearable. The only song I didn't like was My Alien, which was flat out stupid. But numbers like God Must Hate Me, I'm Just A Kid, and Addicted are unbelievably catchy, even if they didn't get anywhere near the Modern Rock charts. Which is a bit sad, I might add.<br />Simple Plan are ten times better than Good Charlotte. Not because they're Canadian... well yeah, that, but they have much more energetic, catchy songs and less ballads for crying out freakin' loud! Even if this band does use like, three chords, and GC uses more, Simple Plan makes the better music. Work with what you have... if it's three chords, so be it. They made a good album. People writing 1-star reviews must of heard Perfect on their adult contemporary stations.
B000002UWL|5.0|Were it not for &quot;How can you expect to be taken seriously?&quot; and &quot;The end of the world&quot;, this would be a perfect album.  Not that these are bad songs, but they simply don't stand up to the brilliance that this album otherwise has going through every track.  Too bad they didn't include &quot;Miserablism&quot; instead - that is a wonderful song which was recorded at the same time.  This album is filled with emotional, vulnerable, beautiful songwriting with surface appeal yet incredible depth.  &quot;So hard&quot; is one of the most wonderful, sinister pop songs ever written.  I could go on and on.
B00005R24K|4.0|Being a big fan of Army of Darkness for some time I'd long been planning on checking out the first 2 Evil Dead films. I picked up Evil Dead 2, and while it is quite good it didn't quite live up to expectations. Still, I was sufficiently intrigued that I decided to finally pick up the original. By this point, however, I was a bit suspicious of it, starting to wonder if the consistently positive reviews of it were a case of mass hysteria, or if the low budget combined with an emphasis on gore and visual effects would make it seem too dated. Fortunately, my concerns over the film made my actually seeing all the more enjoyable, as it easily surpassed expectations and still stands as a first rate horror film.<br />I need to say, right off the bat, that this is a serious horror film.  Most people know this, but there is a fairly sizable contingent who seem to think that this is a parody or comedy.(as are the sequels) It does contain some humor, and has a greater emphasis on being unusual and surreal than your average horror film, but it is, by and large, very serious.<br />As most critics love to point out, this film is a bit short on plot.(Not that I'm looking for plot when I see a horror movie) In short, 5 young adults go to a cabin in the woods, find a book, find a tape, play the tape, become possessed by demons and must fight the demons.  It's not much on paper, but the execution is excellent.  The major caveat is the acting, although it really isn't as bad as lots of people make it out to be.  I would rarely call it good, but it usually isn't bad enough that I'm taken out of the movie.  Also, the visual effects occasionally falter, most notably during the 2 obvious uses of ridiculous looking dummy heads. Overall, the effects aren't necessarily realistic, but they are generally cool or gross or both.  And their lack of realism doesn't much matter as it is well established that once possessed the people change greatly from a physical standpoint, and are far from human.  Lots of the gore effects are self-consciously over the top, most notably the moist 'n gooey claymation extravaganza at the end.  The most effective effect, however, is just about the simplest.  This is, of course, the agonizing pencil-to-the-ankle scene, which stands as one of the most painful scenes to watch that I've come across.  Also of particular note is the scene where one of the demons proceeds to chew their own hand off. A tad inexplicable, but effective none the less.<br />This movie is interesting as it displays an unusual combination in horror films: it is very gory, yet it is very slow and deliberately paced.  The first half of the film is largely uneventful, but I think it sets the mood pretty well and is more interesting then the exposition of your average horror film.  And the second half, which is pretty much non-stop horror is still slow and deliberate, as the demons are sadistic and playful, choosing to mock and torment their victims rather than simply kill them outright.  The horror set pieces are generally excellent. I particularly like when the lone Ash is assailed by 2 demons simultaneously, one in the room with him, the other clutching at him from the below.  While this movie isn't really scary, it is pretty eerie at times.  The initial possession is quite creepy, particularly the spontaneous levitation and her slow, crippled movements.  The standard 'character is walking through the empty rooms looking for someone' are unusually good as well, generally generating some real tension.  The demons are occasionally a bit over the top, but this is largely negated as they are clearly intended to be a bit mischivious.(murderous too, however) They're makeup is usually pretty effective as well, if a bit weird.  Cheryl's blue, sometimes grey-blue witch face is more effective then it seemed from still pictures, particularly when she is laughing with blood pouring out of her mouth.  Linda's porcelain doll make-up is kinda annoying to look at but it fitsher evil and giggly little girl persona very well. Every character has their face horribly mangled or covered in blood at some point during the film and they generally look quite disgusting.<br />Sam Raimi is famed for his inventive camera work, and it shines here.  The scenes where Ash is apparently on the brink of insanity are quite cool, with lots of crazy shots, ranging from ones tilted at a 45 degree angle to one looking directly down from the rafters to extremely low shots, from underfoot. The absolute visual highlight of the film comes when we are given a low shot viewing two corpses in the foreground.  Ash proceeds drag one of the bodies outside and the camera tracks him, moving along side til it reveals the possessed Cheryl waiting patiently in the basement. The `force' shots are pretty cool to, particularly the one where it rams through the cars windshields.<br />A few closing notes. Personally, I found the infamous plant scene to be a bit, I dunno, stupid.  The end of it was just messed up. Not a huge flaw by any means, but it did hurt the film a bit. Also, as many have mentioned, make sure to get the Elite version.  All Anchor Bay versions are in pseudo-widescreen where they matted out the top and bottom of the picture.  I accidentally got one matted as such, and while it probably isn't a huge deal, it's just stupid to have it cut like that.<br />All in all this is a very good horror film. It's got gore and violence combined with well designed scenes and plenty of visual flair. Check it out.<br />  8/10ts her evil and giggly little girl persona very well.

B0000026T4|5.0|This is absolutely Alice Coopers best album and I'm sure it's the best one from 1989 (can't remember any better from that year). The whole album is really good with great hits such as Poison, House Of Fire and Bed Of Nails. Ok, there are a few less good songs (Trash, This Maniac's In Love With You and I'm Your Gun) but they're defenitely not bad. In opposite of Constrictor and Raise Your Fist And Yell this album doesn't sounds that 80's. Trash is a treasure for those who search for a great hard rock album and it's actually worth more than $9.98.
1577311523|5.0|In practical terms life is like a passing parade and we are all children fascinated by the pomp and ceremony of the unfolding drama. Some of us get caught up in what has already passed us by and cannot see what should be plainly visible before our eyes. Others anticipate the coming events and miss the actual parade entirely. Mr Tolle says simply enjoy the parade as it proceeds, not as it was or as it will be. (...) A few critics claim he does not reference great books of the past or that his ideas are old stuff being rehashed. What they do not seem to understand is that they are not the only parade watchers. The part of the parade they have seen might be old to them but it is new to others and has not even begun for some. The entire parade is always unfolding \\"Now\\" even though each spectator sees it from his or her own particular viewpoint. Truth, wisdom, realizations and revelations, no matter where or when they first appeared are never old in themselves. They only seem old when the time bound mind looks back, and they are of no value whatsoever unless and until they are brought up to the Now and experienced in the Now. The ancient truths explained in \\"The Power of Now\\" are as new today as they have ever been or will ever be. Mr. Tolle presents them in plain and simple terms, easily understood by those with eyes to see and/or ears to hear. Events in the parade of life pass by us continuously. Some disappear into yesterday and seem to be lost in time. Others, frolicking in the playground of the wandering mind, called imagination, may appear to be coming tomorrow. But the actual parade, your own Parade of Life, mine, and Mr. Tolle's is unfolding now. Once we realize that time does not exist in the past or future we can experience the joy of our passing parade as it unfolds infinitely and eternally. Life is the only real event that is happening, and it is happening now. Mr. Tolle explains this in a most excellent way. The Power of Now cannot change your life. Nothingcan alter perfection. But it can change your life situations if you let it. The book is excellent.
0061015725|4.0|The decline of respect for science and nature studies in the United States owes much to Michael Crichton.  In books such as Andromeda Strain and Jurrasic Park, he portrays Nature as a capricious force, needing only a thoughtless step or touch of greed to launch a cascade of uncontrollable events.  This book takes the theme a large step forward by using nanotechnolgy to present yet another threat to humanity.<br />Jack Forman, unemployed programmer, is a forty-year-old househusband to a wife successful in a new high-tech company.  Xymos, inevitably under military contract, is developing a reconnaissance technology using networking nanobots.  They've been programmed with predator algorithms to focus on &quot;goals&quot; to achieve their purpose.  Also inevitably, they elude control, escaping into the Nevada desert.  Their predation skills net them coyotes, rabbits and rattlesnakes - and certain microchips.  In the final inevitability, their ultimate prey is humans.  Jack, who understands their programming best, is called in as a consultant to show the rest of the research team how to restore control.<br />From this point Crichton's narrative unfolds like a film script [which, of course, is the intent].  There are deaths, the nanobots, following a contrived Darwinian ideal, evolve well beyond the intent of their original instructions.  They develop new skills at a stupendous rate, each step forward presenting a greater threat to Jack and his colleagues.  Jack's wife, Julia, arrives at the Nevada site, ostensibly in support.  Changes in her recent behaviour suggest, inevitably, she's having an affair with one of the team.  What appears to be illicit romance, however, proves something more sinister.  Inevitably, Jack is almost alone in his role as combative consultant.<br />Crichton is always as up-to-date with technology as the literature allows.  His extensive bibliography demonstrates his research to anyone's satisfaction.  That he can take it a step further only demonstrates his imaginative skills.  In line with many of his recent books, his  research has left him with little energy for a developed plot.  His characters are thin and events predictable.  It's a &quot;page turner&quot; to find out What Happens Next, but there's little doubt over the ultimate outcome.  Yet, as with most of his works, the conclusion is vague.  The reader is intentionally left unsatisfied.  This is as much a contribution to the vague disquiet over science and nature among his readers as the topic of the story.  While this might be viewed as a call for more and better research, Crichton makes it clear that he considers all science suspect.  That's an unfortunate attitude.

B0001LJCPC|5.0|I just recently bought this cd at tower records and all I could say is that it will be kept in my cd walkman for some time.This soundtrack much like the movie plays as a western and has some truly outstanding tracks all the way through.All the songs are good but standout songs include goodnight moon,the chase and malaguena salerosa.This cd proves that once again tarantino does have a good ear for music in his kick ass movies.I must confess that even though I really like this soundtrack I still feel that the soundtrack for volume 1 is still superior and it should be included in your collection.I cant wait for the dvd release of this movie but the soundtrack will have to do for now.

B000002ADT|3.0|There is a serious flaw in claiming any album is the best. It encourages people not to diversify their listening patterns and thereby stunts musical growth.<br />This album is important historically but I suspect a majority of people that bought &quot;Kind of Blue&quot; would prefer listening to Miles Davis on either one of the albums &quot;Somethin'Else&quot; or &quot;Sketches of Spain&quot;. I am basing this on various people I have talked with over the years that had in addition bought one of the other two Miles Davis albums.<br />Those that are new to jazz I would suggest you buy &quot;Kind of Blue&quot; or one of the other two mentioned. Then additionally, buy the two albums &quot;16 Most Requested Songs&quot; by Louis Armstrong and &quot;The Black Saint &amp; Sinner Lady&quot; by Charles Mingus.<br />This suggestion is based on exposing the ear to more diversity in jazz. The Armstrong trumpet will express many emotions and the blues will be less melancholy and possess more dynamics than Miles Davis on &quot;Kind of Blue&quot;. The Mingus album will have more changing tembre, rhythm, pitch, dynamics and a greater fusion of the idioms that make up jazz. For many people this can make jazz more stimulating and a greater intellectual experience.

B0000AXE8I|3.0|What happens these days when Hollywood finds a hit on their hands with a sequel on the way? They worry about throwing away easy money and fill the sequel with lots of car chases and overblown fight scenes! Hence the Martix Reloaded. Yet all in all, perhaps because the original was so, um, original, this movie manages to entertain quite well. I would have to disagree with Amazon's (and seemingly everyone else's) comment that it's difficult to make a sequel as good as the original. Especially in a genre as wide open as sci-fi, it should not be impossible to stick to character and plot development and emerge with something that challenges people's preconceptions again. Just make the movie a bit longer in order tie it properly to the first. But Hollywood seems afraid or unable to come up with plots that go off on new yet equally interesting tangents. If you've got a fan base count your money first and worry about art some other day...
B0000A1RJI|2.0|Klaus Badelt's soundtrack is good but some themes seem to be almost copied from Hans Zimmer's score to &quot;Gladiator.&quot; Knowing that Zimmer is the overproducer, I wonder how much of the score is truly Badelt's original work and how much is &quot;borrowed.&quot; If you own the soundtrack to &quot;Gladiator&quot; you don't necessarily need to own this one as they are much the same. I recommend buying Badelt's soundtrack to &quot;The Time Machine&quot; instead.

B000005ILF|1.0|This is by far Sting's worst album. No wonder it flopped: There are no good songs on this album and it's a shame considering how he came off with the dynamite &quot;Ten Sumner's Tales&quot; from three years earlier. &quot;I'm So Happy I Can't Stop Crying&quot; is just drab and without wit. The same can be said about the rest of this album. Sorry Sting! He is a great musician but this wasn't his year. HOwever his next two albums since then are absolutely phenomenal!
B000002KB8|5.0|While heavy metal bands such as Blue Cheer and Led Zeppelin released their debut albums before Black Sabbath, but they were not as heavy as this bone-crunching sludge album. The album starts with their theme song, which in six little minutes started the whole doom metal thing. Then comes The Wizard, which is a harmonica-laden, metallic song. Then the trio, Bassically, Behind The Wall Of Sleep, and N.I.B. Then the sludgy Wicked World with the great middle piece. Then the 15-minute-plus Warning/Sleeping Village. This is definitely one of the essential metal albums.
0385510438|5.0|After reading The Brethern, and The Summons, it seemed pretty clear that John Grisham's work was going downhill.  A Painted House, Skipping Christmas and Bleachers were all pretty good, but not in his usual genre of legal thrillers.  Then, with King of Torts, although I didn't like it as much as his earlier books, I thought he was on the way back up.  The Last Juror proves that this is true.<br />With a compelling story, great characters and plenty of courthouse drama, Grishma creates a feeling similar to his earlier books, A Time to Kill and The Chamber.  Having never lived in a small town, I don't know how accurate Grisham's picture of it is, however, the important part is he makes it seem beievable, as well as interesting.  I think the courtroom and the small town are where Grisham's storytelling abilities really shine, and getting away form that has made his more recent legal thrillers suffer.  I'm glad to see him return to it in The Last Juror.<br />I hope Grisham's next book continues the improvement that I have seen since The Summons, which I thought was his worst book to date.  Grisham fans, as well as any fans of the genre should enjoy this book.

B000002H6C|4.0|The music is superb. If it had been as masterfully mixed as Ride The Lightning or Master Of Puppets, this would have been a five-star album. But, unfortunatly, the production is atrocious. There is no bass whatsoever on the album, the guitars sound thin, and Lars Ulrich's drums have this irritating clicky sound that can get on your nerves. Oh yeah, James' voice. On the previous 3 albums James had a nice voice, but on this, it's just bad. But the songs are great. Blackened kicks the album off with a tale of the destruction of the world. Then comes the nine-minute-plus title track, with its tale of corruption and greed in the government. Eye of the Beholder, which comes next, is the best song on the album. The semi-ballad, One, was Metallica's first ever Top 40 hit, and the band's first ever music video. The music goes slightly downhill after that, but don't worry, the songs are still great. The album ends with the powerful, headbanging tale of James Hetfield's childhood, Dyer's Eve. Dyer's Eve is probably the next to best song on the album, after Eye Of The Beholder. This would probably be a thrash metal classic if it weren't for the production quality. But it can still wallop ya good.
B00004S6GL|5.0|Figure 8 is a soundscape of its own. Lushly and crisply produced, each song resonates in its own way. Many Elliott Smith fans feel that the sound encompassed by Figure 8 is of a lower integrity or quality than Elliott's earlier music, such as the famously &quot;lo-fi&quot; Roman Candle. Figure 8 shows Elliott crafting rich arrangements eerily reminiscent of the Beatles--especially the soaring penultimate track, &quot;Can't Make A Sound&quot;. Elliott's voice is lush and startling on this album; I do miss his certain qualities of it that were present on his earlier, starker albums. Figure 8 is addictive.
B00009W0U4|5.0|After witnessing the nightmare of Gaspar Noe's \\"I Stand Alone,\\" a movie that left me in open-mouthed awe for days afterwards, I just knew I had to see \\"Irreversible.\\" I am not a big foreign film aficionado, not by a long shot, but Noe's films are worth watching simply because they are deeply disturbing jaunts into the darkest recesses of the human psyche. He's not above showing life as it really is, and he does it in ways that make you laugh at the cleverness of the presentation even as you cringe in disgust at the subject matter. In other words, his pictures are right up my alley. I always love to watch cinema that challenges the viewer on some level, something rare indeed in an age of the American special effects laden summer blockbusters. That doesn't necessarily mean I always like these types of films; oftentimes I don't when the fine line between challenging and pretentiousness is crossed, but Noe's stuff is great because it is premium grade weirdness. \\"Irreversible\\" will remind many viewers of the American film \\"Memento,\\" except Noe's film is darker, oh so much darker, than that movie.<br />\\"Irreversible\\" flows backwards, with the closing credits opening the film and each scene shown from the end towards the beginning. Right from the start, you know you're going to see something different. Boy, are you ever! A sex club with fleeting sounds and images of pornographic behaviors, a sickening scene of a human head being bashed in with a fire extinguisher, and an arrest quickly start you wondering about what it all means. As the film progresses (regresses?), we learn why one man killed another in that seedy bar. Alex (Monica Bellucci), a rather carefree soul, was brutally raped and beaten by a thuggish French pimp in a subway tunnel. Her boyfriend Marcus (Vincent Cassel) promptly had an emotional meltdown when he discovered what happened to his lovely woman. Full of seething rage, he goes on a rampage through the city looking for the man who maimed Alex. Along for the ride is Pierre (Albert Dupontel), Alex's former boyfriend who desperately attempts to rein in Marcus's reckless quest for vengeance.<br />Surprises abound in \\"Irreversible,\\" surprises that will leave you thinking about the film long after it ends. I was a little amazed I figured out how the film concludes (begins, actually) long before I got there. You just knew there had to be some big, explosive revelation that would give Alex's victimization even more pathos. Well, there is and it's quite shocking. In fact, it would have worked almost as well had the film been shown in chronological order. Since Noe chose to reverse the sequence of the scenes, he not only retains the film's shock value but also imbues it with a frequently recurring sense of \\"what if.\\" If only Marcus had paid more attention to his wife at that party. If only Alex had listened to Pierre and not gone out alone in a dangerous neighborhood. If only, if only, if only. You get the idea. This sense of identification gives the movie its edge. We've all done the same thing, asked the same questions, after a personal tragedy. I know I have.<br />What shocks even more are the things Gaspar Noe can get away with showing in a French film. The French have little problem with overt pornography, morally repugnant violence, and lengthy discussions on the most intimate details of sexual relationships. Sure, American films are violent and sometimes crass in their discussions of sex, but not like the French films I have seen lately. I can't imagine any mainstream film made here that would show a rape sequence that runs for nearly ten minutes, or the weird goings on in a club. If you have a serious problem with any of these issues, stay far, FAR away from \\"Irreversible.\\" For that matter, stay just as far away from Noe's \\"I Stand Alone,\\" a movie that shows in gruesome detail a murder/suicide. I will say that the filmmaker does not in anyway attempt to glorify the vicious acts of cruelty and barbarism he depicts inhis movies. That doesn't mean it makes these incidents any easier to watch, however.<br />\\"Irreversible\\" is a shocker on many levels, a film not suited to a majority of the movie going public. It's not the sort of movie you would take a date to, or watch with members of your family unless you're a member of the Manson family. It should go without saying that Noe's picture is not suitable for young children. I recommend watching \\"Irreversible\\" alone so that it becomes a personal experience. I don't know what Gaspar Noe will come out with next, or if he'll ever make another film again, but I want to see it whatever it ends up being. If you haven't seen \\"I Stand Alone\\" before watching this one, make sure you see it soon. Fans of this type of cinema should also check out \\"Baise-Moi,\\" another French film filled with even greater amounts of nihilism and despair than this one.his movies.

B000002540|5.0|This live LP capped off the 1st era of the mighty BOC.  The tracks are given a live shakedown, and the viciousness of early 70s hard rock is evident.  Rarely is this (2004) age will you hear such clear, sharp, and piercing riffing as heard on this one.  Buck Dharma really shines, and the band as a whole shred thru the eerie opener &quot;The Subhuman&quot; all the way to the closing cover tunes--&quot;Masarati GT&quot; and &quot;Born/Wild&quot; are left in smoking ruins of busted guitars and strings.  &quot;ME 262&quot; showcases the 5-guitar prowess of this, the best American hard rock band ever.
0385484518|1.0|I enjoy Mitch Albom's writing  but had a hard time relating to Morrie. He talks a lot about not just striving for money and success. Some how though he could aford to have 24x7 home care. My parents both went through months of near physical helplessness before they died and I only wished I could have afford the type of care Morrie apparently received.   It's easy to talk about not being money hungry when you already have it along with a university job that wasn't in danger of being downsized. I am sure he was sincere but if he was poor and his wife or a child needed 24x7 care that he couldn't afford I wonder what he would say then.
B000089RV6|5.0|WOW! I love this CD! They are truley a talented group! For this whole year now I have listend to this and only this! It's the best! I went from not barely knowing who the band AC/DC was to knowing every fact about them and loving them just through this CD! The vocals and guitars are just balanced out perfectly. I could go on and on about it. It's amazing!

B00005JMFQ|5.0|Love Actually is a brilliant film, one of my favorites of 2003. It never fails to leave me smiling, no matter how many times I watch it. It's an energetic, emotional, and funny film, a true romantic masterpiece if there ever was one.<br />Richard Curtis, the genius behind the film adaptation of Bridget Jones's Diary, Notting Hill, and Four Weddings and a Funeral, flawlessly combines 10 wonderful interwining stories, some better than others, but all great. Luckily, the better stories get more screentime and are more fully developed. It all ends quite happily, in one perfect sequence after another. He has assembled an amazing cast, all perfect in their roles, bringing the fantastic script to life. Perhaps 10 different stories is a bit much for some people, but I thought it was wonderfully done.<br />Many people have also expressed their utter disgust at the sex and nudity in the film. Guess what? The film is R-rated for a reason, and the reasons are given under the rating so people won't go into a film and complain about the sexual content. However, as usual, someone always manages to find a reason to whine. It goes to show how close-minded most people are, which is rather tragic considering we're in the 21st Century. Get over it! It's a shame that so many people might not get to see such a terrific film, because of a few scenes with nudity. Tragic, really.<br />As Richard Curtis points out in the commentary, the original cut of the film ran at over 3 and a half hours (a version I am dying to see since even at 2 hrs and 10 mins, I felt the film was too short). However, as an added bonus on an otherwise bare-bones DVD, we get 40 minutes of those deleted scenes with a Richard Curtis introduction. I would have preferred the cut material incorporated back into the film as a viewing option, but for now, this is good enough. Hopefully, a more complete DVD will be released soon.<br />Love Actually is a wonderfully entertaining, emotional, and feel-good film. Everyone will relate to one story or another. As the movie goes to prove, Love Really Is All Around Us, and it's a fabulous feeling indeed. If this movie doesn't leave you smiling, then perhaps nothing will.
B0000BYM3K|3.0|If you don?t know by now the basic Maiden sound, then you?re gonna be left behind because I don?t think I need to go over it. It?s all here as usual so the BIG differences would have to be the songwriting and production, and they are. I imagine that some people, like me, would compare this album to their previous releases, but keep in mind to not limit yourself to JUST those previous releases. Every song on this album has either a riff, solo, bass line, or vocal melody that most longtime Maiden fans will find very recognizable and they even add a synthesized orchestra. But the lyrics could use some working on. The lyrics are simple, the chourses seem to repeat themselves over and over, but actual songwriting is solid, with Maidens traditional epic storytelling. For some of you, this is an enjoyable Maiden classic, but to some of you, this could be &quot;Brave New World&quot; all over again, the choice is yours to decide.
0385512104|4.0|The Curios Incident of the Dog in the Night-time, by Mark Haddon, is a brilliantly written novel about a fifteen-year-old autistic boy named Christopher John Francis Boone, \\"who knows all the countries of the world and their capitals, and every prime number up to 7,057.\\" Christopher lives in England with his father and pet rat Toby; sadly Christopher's mother died two years ago in the hospital due to an unexpected fatal heart attack. Christopher begins his story with a mysterious midnight murder of his neighbor's dog, named Wellington. But as Christopher begins his \\"detective work\\" of figuring out who murdered Wellington and their motive, hidden secrets and masked troubles about his family and of his past begin to unravel, all by accident and by a twist of fate. <br />          Prior to reading this book, I had limited knowledge on how autistic people thought and coped day-to-day in this world, but I truly think that this book helped me to compensate for that lack of knowledge with amazingly acute details of what supposedly goes on inside the head of a child with autism. I believe what sets this book apart from others, besides the amount of knowledge and understanding about autism that is obtained from reading this book, is how the information in it is presented. I strongly believe that this book would give someone an insight and help them learn about how autistic people behave and think, without struggling through the medical jargon in a medical or doctoral report about autism. I feel this way because this book is written through an autistic child's perspective; reading this book is just like looking through the kid's eyes and feeling and experiencing everything that he is. I think that that is much more valuable than a medical report stating the \\"progress\\" or \\"well-being\\" of someone with autism, and what made this book even better was that it was so enjoyable and fun to read that I had a hard time tearing myself from it!<br />      Overall, I totally enjoyed learning how people with autism get through each day and the differences and similarities they have with people who are not autistic. There was nothing I did not enjoy about this book; I thought it was fascinating all around. I would recommend this book to anyone because I think it would be extremely beneficial if more people were aware of how autism affects the people who have it and those people around them.
B0001AP12G|5.0|Best CD I've heard, all songs are solid and could be singles.  With the exception of some of the short tracks at the beginning like I'll fly away, I could listen through this album

B00008DDHZ|3.0|&quot;Sunday Bloody Sunday&quot; was a John Lennon song from his &quot;Some Time In New York City&quot; set that introduced me to this sad day.  &quot;When Stormont bans out marches,&quot; was the chorus that rattled in my head for the early 70s.  Then the U2 song came out.  Now I'm pleased to see this film.<br />It's hard to review this film without either reviewing the event itself and the political situation that surrounds it or reviewing the cinema verite style that director Paul Greengrass employs.  There is no doubt that &quot;Bloody Sunday&quot; is powerful.  I sat watching the credits roll afterwards and listened to the U2 song even after the screen went black.  I found this film less effective that the docu-drama &quot;Veronica Guerin.&quot;  Gerald McSorely played Irish Mafioso John Gilligan in &quot;VG&quot;; and here plays Capt. Supt. Lagan who sits dumbfounded hearing the news, patently ignored by the British officers.<br />The film is centered around Ivan Cooper played by James Nesbitt.  He does an excellent job as a wheeler dealer politician who then becomes dumbfounded at the day's results.  Tim Piggott-Smith does a marvelous job as the boneheaded Gen. Robert Ford who goads the British into the confrontation and then crows about it as a tremendous success.<br />The short abrupt cuts didn't work as well for me.  If they had started with longer sequences and progressively been snipped to shorter and shorter shots as we approach the massacre, the film would have had more of a sense of build.  As it is, it does convey the sense of confusion with people talking at once, not listening to each other, and then the screen cutting to a completely different setting and sequence, leaving each part dropped but adding to a cumulative effect.<br />Because this film is about an extremely important event, one that is unfortunately mirrored in too many unjust situations around the world, it does have a universality and resonance.  On the other hand, because we don't spend long enough with each character, because we don't come to know the 13 killed or the 14 wounded, there is a facelessness to the proceeding.  It would have been more moving for me if like &quot;Veronica Guerin&quot; we become directly involved with the characters and concerned with their outcome.  Even so, it's a film that deserves to be seen.

0385510438|1.0|This book was horrible. Predictable, circular, pointless, ridiculous. This is not at all what I expected from John Grisham. Don't waste your time or money. I wish they had a zero star rating. It would go to this book.
B0000TB01Y|4.0|To me, the initally panned (by critics, anyway) &quot;Wicked&quot; score suffers from the same problem that plagues all Stephen Schwartz scores.  Mr. Schwartz has never been able to write songs on the level of greats like Sondheim or Kander and Ebb, and in the hands of the wrong performer his weaknesses as a composer become very evident.  The same can be said of &quot;Wicked,&quot; which features only one or two truly great songs.<br />However, Mr. Schwartz is by no means a bad composer, and at any rate he was smart enough to track down some INCREDIBLE talent to sing his score.  Leading the charge is 2004 Tony winner Idina Menzel in the central role of Elphaba, the eventual Wicked Witch of the West.  She grounds the show with her amazing performance and flawless singing.  No one on Broadway can belt out a song like Menzel can, and she does so multiple times throughout the CD.  She belts &quot;The Wizard and I&quot; and &quot;No Good Deed&quot; to the rafters, but they can't touch to vocal pyrotechnics that make up the Act I Finale &quot;Defying Gravity.&quot;  Trust me when I say you'll be hitting the replay button on that track.<br />And what about the esteemed Ms. Chenoweth?  She does well with her songs too, but they are not as well crafted as Menzel's and Schwartz can't seem to decide what octave he wants the part in.  I saw both her and Menzel on Broadway, and in person she is much more effective due in large part to some hillarious one-liners in the dialogue scense that perfectly complement her comic timing.  Without her body and the book scenes to support her, she is merely a gorgeous soprano with some lackluster songs.  Still, &quot;Popular&quot; is quite amusing and will probably become an audition/cabaret item real soon.  The supporting cast doesn't get a whole lot to do on this CD, with the standout being Norbert Leo Butz's Fiyero on &quot;Dancing Through Life.&quot;<br />The &quot;Wicked&quot; score isn't the best, but it is amazing infectious and you will find it growing on you immensely after the first listen.  And if nothing else, you always have Idina Menzel to look forward to, who has become a full-fledged star with this role.
B00005JKYI|5.0|What can I say.  This is the Godfather of dancing movies.  You got served, Save the Last Dance, and Dirty Dancing 2 would not exist without Footloose.  Kevin Bacon is sensational, that kid has a few moves!<br />Based on a true story (According to E!), Footloose is about a pack of high school kids fighting for their right to DANCE.  &quot;There is a time to laugh, and THERE IS A TIME TO DANCE,&quot; quote Kevin Bacon.  You see, these kids live in a redneck town where people wear cowboy boots don't want kids to dance.  Dancing was thought of as dangerous, and the leading cause of teenage pregnancy.  So they want to ban dancing... but when the kid from Chicago (Kevin Bacon) showed up, he taught his redneck friends how to dance and decided to fight the resistance and want to be freed from the<BR>anti-dancing act.  <br />As with any movie, there has got to be antagonists.  Besides crazy dancing and tight 80's style jeans, this movie is loaded with action scenes.  There is a scene where Lori Singer's ex-boyfriend shows America how to beat up Lori Singer, and there is a scene where Kevin Bacon drop kicks Lor Singer's ex-boyfriend and helps young Chris Penn (when he wasn't all fat) kick 5 people's @SS.  This movie is also loaded with testosterones:  scenes of pickup trucks, roll bars and dancing on football field bleachers proves me right!<br />In many ways, this movie reminds me of the importance of Freedom.  The need for Americans to fight for the right to party!  Some people may laugh at the cheesy lines, lame outfits and the fact that Kevin Bacon's choreography is entertaining, but it should be taken just as serious as movies like T2 and Matrix in which the protagonist fight for the FREEDOM of fellow mankind.<br />If you are looking for a lighthearted film with plenty of action and laughter, you do not want to miss this great film.  Kevin Bacon, I always knew you are a talent... Superb Cast and Excellent Film!
0440238609|2.0|It was after the whole BBC's \\"The Big Read\\" that the Dark Materials trilogy came to my attension (it being in the top five finalistss).  I saw the first book in a shop the week after and bought it, and eventually read all three novels.<br />I must admitt that the way that Pullman adresses the ideas of religeon in this controversal way is fun to read.  I also can't deny that Pullman has one of the greatest imaginative brains that I have come across in an author.  But I found it quite dull really - it never reallly held me as well as much as most other books have.
B0001906O0|5.0|Your Cure collection is not complete without this gem!  The ultra-rare \\"To The Sky\\" is worth the $40 price alone, not to mention \\"2 Late\\" and \\"A Chain of Flowers\\".  Definately for the hardcore Cure fan!
0800141806|1.0|\\"Philadelphia\\" is Hollywood's pathetic, hygienic attempt to deal with the maelstrom of controversy surrounding AIDS. It just doesn't want to offend anyone. (Even the Talking Heads's song \\"Heaven,\\" heard in one scene, has its \\"heaven is a place where nothing ever happens\\" lyric rendered not so offensive.) The performances of Tom Hanks and Denzel Washington are noteworthy, but the film refuses to fully explore how AIDS can lay waste to a person's body, mind, and relationships. Does our main character's family and friends struggle with an admixture of hatred, disgust, pity, and sorrow for their infected son? Of course not! That would be too real for the suburban megaplex crowd and for the gay community. No, in \\"Philadelphia,\\" the AIDS victim's family and friends are supportive until the end. Who's the bad guy? Well, it's our hero's employer, whose somewhat understandable fears of a ravaging syndrome (which was not fully understood in 1993) being introuduced in the workplace are portrayed as malicious. The subject of AIDS is a powderkeg, but in \\"Philadelphia,\\" it seems about as controversial as cancer.
0140177396|4.0|Reading the book Of Men and Mice was a very interesting. The novel catches the reader once they open the book. Personally I have nothing in common with the characters from the story. While reading this story I became very interested in the Great depression and the migrant workers having a hard time trying to live. To anyone who wants to read a fictional story based on the Great Depression they should go and read Of Mice and Men. This novel isn't just about the depression its about two people who are total opposites and stick together to find jobs because they don't have any one else to be with. The book has a lot of events that happen all because one of the two men is very slow, so neither of them could keep a job long enough to save money. Even though you might not interested in reading stories on the Depression you should still read this novel because the events in the story will make you want to read this book. This book shows a lot of feelings that the two men show to each other. They show love and friendship. This story will be very interesting whether your young or old, this book is for everyone.
B00005OWEG|3.0|Compare this with the original, which deserves more stars than are in the night sky, and you'll understand why there are editors. The uncut footage is superfluous and silly, and it distracts from the story, which flows &quot;like a main circuit cable&quot; in the 1979 version. The only good thing I can say is that if Coppola and the studio had to squeeze &quot;Apocalypse Now&quot; for some more money, better to do so with this &quot;redux&quot; instead of some god-awful &quot;Godfather 3&quot;-quality sequel.
B000002GGU|5.0|Bryan Adams' 1984 album &quot;Reckless&quot; has really become his signature album for his career.  Although &quot;Everything I Do, I Do It For You&quot; was his most successful single, that was found on the &quot;Waking Up the Neighbours&quot;.    The album &quot;Reckless&quot; really was a monster hit.  It spawned 6 Top 40 singles including the #1 hit &quot;Heaven&quot; (the other songs were &quot;Run to You&quot;, &quot;Somebody&quot;, &quot;Summer of 69&quot;, &quot;One Night Love Affair&quot;, and &quot;It's Only Love&quot;.   &quot;Reckless&quot; was released at a time when the music and pop industry was in one of its peak periods for the decade.   The fact that &quot;Reckless&quot; had multi-platnium sales and 6 Top 40 singles during a very competitive time in the industry speaks volumes for this particular piece of work.  Bryan also came out when Canadian musicians was making an impact.  Rush was continuing to be a major force in progressive Rock while Corey Hart had some success on the Pop circuit.  Adams would soon pass them and become Canada's #1 music act in terms of commerical sales.<br />The Title &quot;Reckless&quot; says it all.   &quot;Reckless&quot; is actually a reference in to a line in the final song &quot;Aint Gonna Cry&quot; in which Adams sings &quot;I got Reckless baby&quot;.   The album was made when Adams was in his mid 20s and really does a great job at telling tales from a young male's perspective of someone this age.   The songs from the album were all collaborations between Bryan Adams and Jim Vallance.  Many people say when the Adams/Vallance duo split from songwriting in the 90s that Adams career went into decline.  But it was Vallance who contributed some of the strongest songwriting in Bryan's career.<br />Bryan Adams has always been blessed with working with some of the most talented studio musicians in the business.  Many of these musicians have stayed with Bryan for the past 20 years.  Keith Scott and Dave Taylor have been longtime guitarists. Vallance makes percussion contributions.   Mickey Curry and Pat Steward are the drummers while Tommy Mandel plays keyboards.   The producer of this album is Bob Clearmountain known to be one of the best studio mixers in the business.  Clearmountain did a great job at working the right sound on this album.<br />The content of the album is first rate all the way.   As for the packaging, the cover features what has become a trademark black and white picture  of Bryan Adams with a classic 80s haircut and a leather jacket.    The liner notes contain all of the lyrics to all of the songs as well as the band credits and contributions on each song.  There are also 3 notable guests on the album.  The most famous of the 3 is Tina Turner who actually shares lead vocals with Bryan on the Top 40 hit &quot;It's Only Love&quot;.  Her contribution on this album actually coincided with her big comeback in 1984.   The chemistry between Bryan and Tina in this song is incredible and passionate (so much there were actually romantic rumors between the two).   Lou Gramm of Foreigner does some background vocals on &quot;She's Only Happy When She's Dancing&quot; which wasn't a Top 40 hit, but could have easily have been one.   Steve Smith of Journey does Drums on the hit Heaven.<br />The album is arranged perfectly.  I couldn't think of a better song to kick off the &quot;Reckless&quot; album than &quot;One Night Love Affair&quot; and I couldn't think of a better song to wrap the album up with than &quot;Aint Gonna Cry&quot;.    All of the songs are harder edge Rock songs except for &quot;Heaven&quot; which was the lone ballad.    The best song on the album is probably the song &quot;Run To You&quot;.   This was the first single released from the album and it really put Bryan Adams on the music landscape.   I never grow tired of that song.   What also is worth noting are the non Top 40 songs that are on this album  &quot;Aint Gonna Cry&quot;, &quot;Long Gone&quot;, and &quot;She's Only Happy When She's Dancing&quot; all merit as solid hits.  The 4th song &quot;Kids Wanna Rock&quot; is a fan favorite, but not a personal favorite of mine - yet it too could have been a solid hit based on its popularity.<br />I was very surprised this album didn't get consideration for &quot;Album of the Year&quot;.    There is a lot of great lyrics and great music to back this up.  After this album, Adams would release &quot;Into The Fire&quot; which might not have been the commerical monster that &quot;Reckless&quot; was, but would continue to the path of Adams becoming one of the premier musicians in the industry.
B000000W9Z|4.0|The occasionally silly narrative is the only drawback to this record; I sometimes wonder what it would have sounded like without the various characters and their monologues interrupting these excellent songs. Not that the idea doesn't work: the dark, futuristic story informs the lyrics and gives the work a very creepy and urgent feel. Bowie, Eno, Gabrels and the rest of the personnel are said to have played role-playing games and engaged in various other musical experiments during the making of the record, and this sense of play and experimentation shows. Standout tracks: We Prick You, Hallo Spaceboy (which sounds brilliant nine years later on the current Reality tour), I'm Deranged, Strangers When We Meet, and I Have Not Been To Oxford Town.<br />At least three of the songs from \\"Outside\\" were used in films; you have probably heard something from this record before, even if you don't know the work already.
0679428895|4.0|If you love history, thrillers, human drama, this is a very good book.  The research is impeccable, the action very strong, the characters interesting.  I read voraciously and just finished Pompeii; Isaac's Storm, about the Galveston hurricane in 1900 (excellent); and James Dalessandro's 1906, about the great San Francisco Earthquake, which I discovered after reading a review on Bookideas.com.  I highly recommend all three, particularly 1906, which is one of the best novels I have read in years.
B000063DIR|1.0|Review of the (newer) remaster with 1 extra live track.  DO NOT buy this CD!  Find the 1995 remaster with the small cover on it to hear what it sounded like for the first 20 years it was released and went multi-platinum!  This album is my absolute favorite by OZZ solo.  If you like Ozzy's voice and want to hear Randy Rhoads last studio recording, get this CD now!  Every song is an 80's heavy metal masterpiece!!!<br />I'm sure you'll read other reviews here and it's true: the Osbournes have replaced Bob Daisley's bass and Lee Kerslake's Drums with musicians from his current live band.  I like the current guys, but take it from a guy who graduated high school in 1987 with these albums.  It DOES sound different!  You can really tell from the machine-gun opening drum solo in the first song 'Over The Mountain'.  (Also, Crazy Train sounds different on Blizzard too!)  The feud's not only about money, it's about ego.  Daisley wrote and played for Ozzy for his other albums Bark At The Moon, Ultimate Sin (lyrics only), No Rest For The Wicked, &amp; No More Tears (music only) so it must be due to his lawsuit for credit &amp; merchandise royalties for this particular album.  All these other Ozzy CDs have Daisley still on them.  Even Ozzy recently admitted these guys wrote &amp; created the album (March 2002 Guitar World mag) yet they're not even listed in the credits or pictures (Sarzo &amp; Aldrige are)!  WHAT the...???!!!  <br />Please voice an opinion that you will not tolerate bands that remove music on classic albums, no matter what the reason by finding the 1995 remaster used.  I just heard that &quot;Black Sabbath&quot; is playing live without Bill Ward on drums (2004 Ozzfest).  What has happened to the Osbournes?
B00003W8NM|5.0|A real twisted, thought provoking, psychiatric thriller yet I cannot help being entertained by this movie. Both Brad Pitt and Ed Norton play their parts beautifully along with a comical, interesting script and some rather interesting facts and ideas.<br />In every sense, 'Fight Club' excels. It's visually stunning, the cast is superb, the screenplay, directing, Fincher's fingertip touch of adapting the book, the novel itself; it's all a masterpiece and a brilliant observation of todays society and the struggles of defining yourself as a man. Fight club works in every way; as a clever, entertaining movie - as an important forum of discussion - as a remarkable music video etc etc.<br />The first time I saw it, I felt weird, unsure of the movie's quality. It took me a few times to fully realize the meaning of this film, and when I did, I immediately bought it on DVD. Fight Club makes you think, and above all, makes you direct your thinking in ways you haven't previously thought.<br />With a mind blowing conclusion, this film cannot get any better, but remember - you do not talk about Fight Club!
B0001US8EO|3.0|Saddle up, Costner fans -- &quot;Wyatt Earp&quot; has finally made it to DVD.<br />This epic Western biography bombed in theaters, and on video it's obvious why. The movie is long, long, long. It's best to watch this gigantic movie over a two-day period, stopping at the halfway point and picking up where you left off. &quot;Wyatt Earp's&quot; length is its biggest flaw.<br />I hated the movie the first time I saw it, on a pan-and-scan videotape, but DVD has restored the film's visual glory. Physically, this is a beautiful movie. Some of the shots are so lavishly stunning that we are reminded of the landscapes in &quot;Dances With Wolves.&quot; This is the ultimate usefulness of the DVD format -- giving old(er) movies back their original beauty.<br />Costner is better than I remembered in the title role. He does a pretty good job of playing Wyatt from his early 20s to his 60s. He's especially good in the Dodge City sequences, dressed in black, teaching the Mastersons a thing or two about law enforcement. Is he as good as Henry Fonda in &quot;My Darling Clementine?&quot; Not quite, but this is not a bad performance by any stretch of the imagination.<br />The other actors are pretty good, too. Dennis Quaid is strong as Doc Holliday, though Doc really doesn't have that much to do and he has little onscreen chemistry with Costner (I didn't quite buy that these two men were great friends, mostly because Costner's Wyatt is so stand-offish.) Tom Sizemore, Michael Madsen and Bill Pullman also lend strong support. This being very much a guy movie, the female characters don't come off as well and are given scant notice, though Catherine O'Hara earns some praise as Allie Earp.<br />The movie's extreme length, though, almost kills it. &quot;Wyatt Earp&quot; could have used tighter editing and a stronger, more focused story. It does have some good action scenes, and the gunfight at the OK Corral is well handled. Unfortunately, the movie seems to be building toward nothing. I'm surprised it didn't carry us all the way to Wyatt's deathbed scene.<br />Still, I respect the movie; it's an impressive Western, and I'm glad to have it on DVD at last. And it's far from being the worst of Kevin Costner's movies.
B0001HAISQ|5.0|This movie was a great version of the well-known fairy tale (I kinda liked this version better). There is a very cute and innocent attraction between Peter Pan and Wendy which seems to be the focus of the movie, which makes this movie unique from others. Im surprised that this movie didnt do so well in the box offices (I would know, for I used to work at a theater in the ticket booth)when its a real magical story. All in all, this is definetly worth watching and worth having in your dvd collection!
B000002JNG|5.0|Here is Plant's last Rock and Roll stand... his voice starting to get a little weary from the amazing display he'd put on for over two decades by this point, his age starting to show enough to where it might be a tad embarrassing to do this sort of thing in the near future, he made extraordinary use of his young band and blasted one final hard rock statement through the gates, just because he could.  The production has a bit of the late eighties / early nineties sheen to it, but the performances are very relevant.  One other thing that becomes very apparent to the listener is how much fun Plant was having... and only the very uptight or too-hip-to-be-bothered could miss it.  Too bad Plant didn't remember the fun when he assembled 66 to Timbuktu... instead of five tracks each from his last two discs, he would've done himself a service to include more than Tie Dye on the Highway from this hearty rock album, perhaps replacing a couple of the more recent tracks with Anniversary or She Said or the huge opening track, Hurting Kind (I've Got My Eyes on You).  Holy smokes, mi amigo...
B00003CXCT|5.0|Well, I must admit I am a fan of Star Wars.  But these few last years, reading many comments on Amazon about both the first trilogy and the yet unfinished second one, I can't stand fans who blame George Lucas for being what he is and for making what he makes.  <br />I consider the opinions of fans who say that THEY prefer the original trilogy to the special one.  Who can blame them?  But they don't express themselves in these words, on the contrary they blame George Lucas for making changes to what they think is THEIR movie.  Well I say : Star Wars is George Lucas's work, project, dream, movie and creation.  He does what he wants with it.  Who cares if Solo shoot first?  Solo is Lucas's character and he may decides what he wants him to do.<br />Moreover, fans seem to prefer the movie as an artist's work rather than a story.  George Lucas intended to write a story first and believe me, Star Wars is a big one, very interesting (for me, at least).  I would be glad if fans were satisfied with a DVD version which would be the original one.  I would buy it myself, as well as the special one.  Anyway, it is possible Lucas will release one, because he is the kind of money-making man that cannot ignore a potentially lucrative affair like that.  If it will be, fans, myself and Lucas would surely be happy.
B000002JKS|5.0|You know, most people seem to malign this album, the last with his best band (echoing a previous sentiment).  This album was both a direct response to the music Plant was hearing at the time and a direct break from the Zeppelin albatross.  People who don't like this disc might have a problem with its synth sound or the fact that it doesn't sound anything like the previous two albums or anything past it, but allowing it to stand on its own merit, free from the &quot;but it doesn't sound like Zeppelin&quot; whine that prevails against so much of his solo work, shines a light of clarity on an album of considerable thought and mastery of the moment.  Plant and company accomplished more on this disc than he would until Dreamland.  It would have been interesting to see where else he would've gone with this band, but he switched gears for the next album, and Blunt, Woodruffe, Martinez, and Hayward (and Halliday) were gone.  More's the pity that 66 to Timbuktu all but ignored this disc, showcasing only Little by Little... give this disc a try, remembering that it is a fearless statement by a legend who had covered the musical gamut in his previous band.
1402541775|5.0|Popping one of these cassettes into my tape player is like an instant trip to a warm and wonderful land where I am reacquainted with all my old friends. Lecar's reading enhances the gentle rhythm of Smith's prose and helps bring to life these fascinating characters. I am addicted to these stories.<br />In this volume the No. 1 Ladies Detective Agency tackles an old murder and a philandering spouse. While hardly unusual issues in the mystery genre. The setting and characters are the real story here. What fun it is to escape into this world if only for a little while. The series reminds me of Lillian Jackson Braun's Cat Who series but without the cats, the endless descriptions of twenty or so town resdents, and the unnecessarily detailed descriptions of the various gourmet foods eaten by the characters. Smith's characters eat stew and drink bush tea, and they will make your mouth water for this simpler way of life.
0385333846|3.0|This book was a big deal in my early teens.  I was discovering the joy of reading for myself rather than under school obligation and it had the most wonderfully irreverent tone, at once playful and cynical yet still caring.  I read it over and over, the first book I ever savored, the last time in 1973.<br /><br />In a way, I wish I hadn't re-read this.  What I see today is a mediocre novel of some substance but ultimately a flimsy reading experience.  The writing is weak, the tone and message feel dated, badly at times.  I suppose I wasn't surprised to be disappointed, since in many ways I read for a living.<br /><br />The book is about Billy Pilgrim, an everyman trying to make a life in his own bewildered way, thrown into WWII as a boy and brought haphazardly  through life as an &#34;unstuck&#34; time traveler, forever re-visiting the past and future of his life.  There is a science fiction aspect to it, also very weak when compared to the greats in the genre.  As a time traveler, he develops a weirdly passive philosophy, basically letting things happen because they must, which is very close to his experience of life.  It's fun in a 1960s kind of way, but appears superficial now.<br /><br />The novel is non-linear, all over the place and attempting advance several narratives at one time; as such, it develops little in the way of emotional involvement, giving it a superficial feel with 2-dimensional characters and an almost idiotically naive pacifism reflecting American angst about the Vietnam War.<br /><br />In the end, I think this is a kid's book, a kid in the 1970s.  I do not think it is a novel that will intrigue anyone beyond scholars of the 1960s.  That is how I recommend this.
B0001US8EO|4.0|I find this movie more interesting and entertaining then &quot;Tombstone&quot;, which to me seemed a little bit too cartoony and overacted(although I DO like that movie).  I was disappointed, however, at the severe lack of extras and the movie being split onto 2 disc when the running time is shorter than other movies I have bought that were on 1 disc. One review mentioned that there was longer version of this movie on VHS.  That version is on this DVD BUT it is under the 'lifted scenes' so you get the same movie but split as what is essentially deleted scenes.  A great movie(it's hard to mess up a western) but the DVD was a slight letdown.  If you are a fan of westerns or Kevin Costner &amp; Dennis Quaid then this movie is definitely worth buying.
B000002LHX|5.0|This soundtrack to the 1989 classic movie &quot; Batman&quot; is superb and fun on every level!<br />Prince sings some great songs like &quot; The Future&quot;, &quot; Partyman&quot; ( one of my personal favorites), &quot; Orion's Arms&quot; ( with Sheena Easton), &quot; Scandalous&quot;, &quot; Electric Chair&quot;, &quot; Batman Remix&quot;, &quot; Waiting for a Call&quot;, &quot; Lemon Crush&quot; and &quot; Trust&quot;.<br />This album is a must own for fans of Prince and the original Batman movie, this album also makes a great party album.
0316666343|5.0|I don't understand why there are so many people on this website who found this novel terrible. There are flaws oviously, but every novel has its flaws. I have never been so touched by a book before. The emotions every character goes threw comes alive. I believe every character is realistic, but then again that's my own opinion. The Lovely Bones, in one sentence, is the kind of novel that reminds us why we read books. <br />Even as beautiful as the novel was to me, I don't recomend it to everyone. Because the subject is oviously not for everyone. As a reader I believe the novel will become a classic. But if anybody asked me if the book was good I would tell them... to me it was phenominal and beautifuly written. And it is my all time favorite book. Give it a chance. I loved it.

B000002JSP|5.0|I may be going off on a limb, but I was thinking recently about how a comparison could be made between the recording careers of Led Zeppelin and the Beatles.  <br />To me, LZ were the Beatles of the '70's.  In the '70's, LZ were the most popular band in the world.  Their albums were huge commercial successes and were praised and copied by musicians around the world.<br />If you look at the final recordings of both bands, I think you'll see an interesting similarity.  &quot;Led Zeppelin IV,&quot; which featured &quot;Stairway to Heaven,&quot; is looked upon by most fans and critics as their &quot;masterpiece.&quot;  The same was said about the Beatles' &quot;Sgt. Pepper&quot; album.  After &quot;Led Zeppelin IV&quot; was released, the band put out four more studio albums.  After &quot;Sgt. Pepper&quot; was released, the Beatles put out four more studio albums.<br />It's interesting to compare Led Zep's final four albums with the Beatles' final four.  LZ's &quot;Houses of the Holy&quot; was appreciated by fans, but was not as highly regarded as &quot;Led Zeppelin IV.&quot;  &quot;Magical Mystery Tour&quot; was also appreciated by fans, but was not as highly regarded as &quot;Sgt. Pepper.&quot;  After releasing such exceptional albums as &quot;Led Zeppelin IV&quot; and &quot;Sgt. Pepper,&quot; it would be incrredibly difficult for ANY band, even two as fantastic as LZ and the Beatles, to duplicate that overwhelming success with a follow-up release.<br />LZ's next album was &quot;Physical Graffiti,&quot; a two-record set.  The Beatles' next album was &quot;The Beatles&quot; (better known as the &quot;White Album&quot;) which also was a two-record set.  Today, many fans of both bands regard these two-record sets as the best music either band either committed to vinyl.  Critics gave these albums mixed reviews.  Many critics believed these albums could've been edited down to single albums.  The extraordinary breadth of musical influences, a quality shared by Led Zep and the Beatles, is revealed in great detail on these albums.<br />The next LZ album was &quot;Presence,&quot; a quickly recorded LP with a very stark, live sound.  The next Beatles' album, in the order in which they were recorded, was the &quot;Get Back&quot; album  An album which was recorded quickly and has a very stark, live sound- in its original incarnation, not in the overblown Phil Spector production called &quot;Let It Be.&quot;  &quot;Get Back&quot; was considered a bit too stark and live (raw, if you will) and the project was put on the shelf.  <br />The final Led Zep recording was &quot;In Through the Out Door,&quot; a richly arranged, well-produced album which focused the band in new directions- the use of synthesizer being a highlight.  &quot;Abbey Road,&quot; the Beatles' final album, was also a richly arranged, well-produced album which focused the band in new directions- the use of synthesizer being a highlight (in 1969, when &quot;Abbey Road&quot; was released, the Moog Synthesizer had never been used extensively on a rock album.)  <br />It's interesting to note that the release of &quot;In Through the Out Door&quot; came approximately ten years after the release of &quot;Abbey Road.&quot;  Both albums were released in the final year of the decade in which each group was at the height of its influence and popularlity- &quot;Abbey Road&quot; (1969) and &quot;In Through the Out Door&quot; (1979).  Who's knows where either band would've gone afterwards?  The final albums of each band illuminate new musical directions which other bands would have to chart for themselves.
0553573403|5.0|I was surprised by this series, a friend of mine who knew I loved Robin Hobb, lended me the first one in the series (this one) and I started reading. He just laughed when I called him two days later and said &quot;give me the next one NOOOOW!&quot; and told him that I had stayed up all night reading. Yes, they are That good.<br />The characters are wonderful, with depth and different reasons. No one's pure evil, they all have good and bad sides. Many of them also grow and make fantastic and realistic changes throughout the series. I like that.<br />There are only two bad thing about these books<br />1. It feels that it is a man who wrote it, some of the war-explainations are a little bit manly and just a slight bit boring. But I still like it and wouldn't want it any other way.<br />2. The rape scenes. I hate, and I mean HATE, reading rape-scenes. The reason I read fantasy is to get away from this horrible world we live in, not to read things like that, blood and war and death I can handle, but not this. I still like the series and I still think they're worth it, but I'm thinking about cutting out those pages... It feels like a cheap way of making you hate someone or feel something... I don't like it. But the series is still worth it, unless you hate them more than I do...
B0000AQS0F|5.0|Like others have mentioned, they bought this after reading some reviews about it. This is one of my favorite all time series. Great characters and great writing and great special effects. Was this on Fox....? They are as stupid as the other regular tv stations (cbs, nbc, abc)... I think the Scifi channel should pick it up and continue it. It deserves to live....
0446677450|5.0|I have read scores of books on personal finance and investing but none of them explain the CONCEPT of acquiring wealth as does this outstanding book.  This book is unique because it explains how to get rich and how to avoid acquiring doodads instead of income producing assets.  Robert Kiyosaki should be applauded for his contribution to the planet -- financial literacy.  Many people however who gain financial literacy, are mentally and emotionally illiterate.  They don't understand how to evaluate risk, optimize their options or how to master the emotions that compromise their success.  To optimize your mental, emotional and financial literacy, you must read Optimal Thinking-How To Be Your Best Self. Then, assemble the best team and get cracking.  You only live once!
0345350499|5.0|Of all the books I have read about the Arthurian legends, this is one of the best.  Granted, it might not actually stick to the more &quot;realistic&quot; historical version of the legend but it is a fantastic read!  You love and hate the characters;  you care in a way that is deep and profound.  I think that this mixes the legends and the reality of ancient religions.  One of the best book.
B00005JMCW|4.0|The acting, story line, and directing of Freaky Friday just couldn't be any better. Jamie Lee Curtis is charming, smart, and gripping as &quot;Mom&quot; and her daughter, Linsey Lohan is absolutely persuasive in &quot;both&quot; roles!<br />Mark Harmon is wisely quiet and understated through the movie letting Mom and Daughter bounce off one another with their crisp, witty, dialogue.<br />This is a fun-filled frolic and perfectly entertaining. Gather the kids and the guys and sit back and let the laughter roll...
B00003CXCT|1.0|This release is of the re-edited version Lucas put out in 1997, incorporating new, more cartoony elements that ruin the atmosphere of the original films. BUT THAT'S NOT ALL. They appear to have continued work on these films, creating even more footage to be wedged into the films, including adding a shot of the prequels' Anakin Skywalker, Hayden Christensen, into the end of Return of the Jedi. You can easily find this shot online if you look for it. It's upsetting. It's a bait and switch: this isn't the movie anyone grew up with. George Lucas doesn't seem to know when to leave well enough alone, and his films and his fans are suffering for it. Don't buy this now; wait until they release the original editions on DVD, which they most definitely will.
B0001CCY7E|5.0|For years, lovers of this soundtrack had to be content with only getting the chance to listen to about 70% of the music from the film.. until now.  Finally we have the entire score for Dances With Wolves on one single reissued and repackaged disc.  Every piece of music is placed in order.. including some wonderful cues that were missing from the original soundtrack.  Even shorter cues like &quot;Shooting Star&quot; and &quot;Arrival at Ft. Sedgewick&quot; are a pure joy, not to mention the film version of the buffalo hunt.  Why every soundtrack that's released isn't put together this way is beyond me, but I'm thankful that this release is finally available in it's entirety.  <br />The sound of the cd is better than the original, though still falls short of the gold disc that was released years back.. but I don't think you'll be disappointed at all.  Released expanded versions of soundtracks seems to be a trend these days.  Classic scores such as &quot;Superman&quot; offer so much more than their original releases.  Let's hope it continues!<br />As for Dances, an already spectacularly moving and beautifully crafted score just got better.  <br />One side note, the liner notes are great, though I wish the photos on the inside were in color instead of black and white.  I'm sure they were going for a certain &quot;feel&quot; but this movie had so many great colors and costumes it would have been nice to have an equally colorful insert book.  I'm certainly not complaining though.. I've been waiting for this cd for well over a decade.
0375758992|5.0|God, I loved this book!  Smart, funny, sad... I love her writing style.  She makes you feel, smell, taste and touch Africa.  I wish I could write like this.  I'm recommending it to everyone I know, and hope that Fuller's latest, &quot;Scribbling the Cat,&quot; is as good.  Even if it's only half as good, it'll be worthwhile!
0345440900|1.0|My sister-in-law, who is a phenomenal mom, recommended the book so I bought it when my daughter was 10 weeks old.  I'm a certified behavior therapist so I can tell you that everything in the book if used systematically and consistently will, eventually, work for all animals as the principles have been scientifically proven for about a century. That having been said, just because we CAN teach someone to do something doesn't mean we SHOULD.  There are, I feel, ethical implications involved in denying a baby food, love, and attention when they need it.  I can teach my daughter not to cry in the middle of the night when she's hungry but what has she learned in the process? Not to tell me when she's hungry because I won't attend to her needs when she does tell me.  Not exactly the kind of introduction to the world I want for my children.  <br />There are responsible books out there which help parents cope when exhaustion and frustration set in, this just isn't one of them.  There are no easy answers to the upheavel a baby brings, but trying to change a baby to fit a pre-baby lifestyle seems short-sighted to me.
B00005RHGL|4.0|In 1993/94, the already controversial story of Wyatt Earp got a big boost with the almost back to back theatrical debuts of two (hope to be) Hollywood blockbusters. Tombstone and Wyatt Earp.<BR>    If you dont think the story of Wyatt Earp and the famous gunfight is controversial (or rather the telling of it) then you have not read through the reviews on Amazon for either film. Then go look up books on the subject and the furr flies. Now the controversy comes from there being two side to the story. <BR> side 1. the most famous side has of couse Wyatt and his brothers as reluctant lawmen defending the town of Tombstone against a band of ruthless outlaws led by Ike Clanton and Curly Bill Brooches.<BR>  side 2. the side rarely taken by Hollywood (a surprise in this day of revisionist history) has Wyatt as a opportunistic criminal who wore a badge when it suited him, and hid behind it in order to dispatch his enemies. To this day the kin folk of the Clantons tell this version of the story...and believe it!!<BR>   When ever a book or movie on the subject is released the two factions (just like the two factions of Tombstone) start verbally swinging. Now I'm a sideone person,as are most folks I have met, more or less. So both of these films appealed greatly to me. Although they are distinctly different.<BR>   Tombstone is in many ways the classic western, bright(read Technicolor), loaded with plenty of humor, plenty of action, and several big name stars. But unlike westerns of yore it is bitingly violent at times, and violence lies just under the surface waiting to spring. Much like I imagine Tombstone was like in the 1880s.<BR>   This film was also the first to show drug use of the period, and to make homosexual references about a few of the characters. Both of these things certainly exsisted in abundance in the west, and kudos to Cosmatos and the producers for allowing them into the film.<BR>  All of the acting is very good here with the performers obviously having fun Val Kilmer as Doc Holiday is by far the most memorable performance. He should have been nominated for an Oscar. It is far superior to Victor Matures(Darling Clemintine), Kirk Douglas(Gunfight at OK Corral) and yes better than Dennis Quaids( Wyatt Earp). While many will hail Quaids as much more realistic ( and I believe this is probably true), Kilmers certainly had an edge of realism but at the same time was very entertaining. It was easy to forget you were watching Val Kilmer.<BR>I believe the story when properly told revolves around Wyatt and Doc, and their friendship. The chemistry between Russel and Kilmer is terrific, and is noticeably missing with Quaid and Costner.     <BR>     This brings us to the most argued point, Wyatt Earp himself. Well, I never knew Mr. Earp, and the professional historians cannot agree, was Wyatt the silent, stoic, and haunted man of Costners portrayal, or the tough when he had to be, money making, somewhat charming, very reluctant lawman. Who knows, from the histories and archived newspaper reports it could go either way. But if I had to choose one over the other I would certainly choose the Wyatt of Kurt Russell, I mean boil it down which one would you want to kickback with and have a shot of whiskey, smoke a cigar, and play a round or two of Faro??<BR>    As far as this DVD release it is excellent, great picture and audio.The extras are fairly intresting, the commentery track by Cosmatos is ok.<BR>   I say saddle this one up and enjoy.
B000002I2M|5.0|What are you doin', stop reading this review and buy the cd, the best album ever made, thats right I said it.
B000002AGN|5.0|This was my first exposure to The Dave Brubeck Quartet. My dad had this album in his record collection. As he bought it just for Take Five,and that was the end of him playing the album, so I kind of inhereted it. I enjoyed the album right away, and began collecting albums by Brubeck one after and another, week after week. After listening to this album, I was also introduced to drummer, Joe Morello. And now, after looking for albums by Brubeck, I only get albums by Brubeck with Joe Morello on it, and others with Joe Morello as a sideman. Anyway, this album starts off with one of the three most famous DBQ songs, (blue rondo a la turk, koto song, and take five). I had no idea about time signatures when I first listened to this album, being about age 12. But somehow I managed to play along with on the drums, no problem. For some strange reason, I was able to play all of Brubeck's odd time signature songs like Eleven Four, Castilian Drums, and of course Take Five, as most kids struggle with odd time signature songs, but I picked it up like that! The next song, Strange Park, was allright, displaying some 3/4, 4/4 techniques featured on the next side. The famous Take Five, which I new nothing of its signifigense was cool, especially with the drum intro. I almost instantainiously picked up the 3/4 brush patterns on 3 to get ready, Kathy's Waltz, and Everybody's Jumpin'. This album sounds like a real late night album. It's echo and coolness, sounded like backround music for a cd store, or a coffee shop. Most other Brubeck albums are not like this. Albums like Southern Scene, Gone With The Wind, and Countdown remind of sun, and the outdoors! I dont think there's a jazz fan in the world who doesn't own this on record or cd, or hasn't heard Take Five. Any young kid or an adult who is just getting in to jazz, will love this album, or jazz, for that matter, after listening to this!

I'm the kind of person who proof-reads menus, church bulletins and (of course) the daily papers.  My husband relies on me to check his papers.  We both LOVED it and recommended it to our sons.

B0000TB050|5.0|After I saw U2 live and then the subsequent release &quot;Rattle and Hum&quot; (their live show in Tempe, Arizona at Sun Devil Stadium..ooh, that dates me!), I thought that video/DVD was a great docudrama of an exceptional band playing live and telling about themselves and their inspirations.  Now, U2, Go Home Live from Shane Castle, has brought the same charisma and talent to a new, younger audience, as well as us that first heard them when in high school/college.  I just want to say, this is a great DVD.  The concert footage shows they have passion and inspiration to fuel their talent.  The songs are flawless.  I especially like how they go from current release numbers from their recent released CD to their earlier songs from Joshua Tree and Unforgettable fire.  Plus, the documentary &quot;Unforgettable Fire&quot;  from 1984 brings back great memories (and this goes to show new discoverers of U2 that though the band was younger looking, they have gotten better with age-sound, style, and professional craftsmanship)  What a way to go U2, you have won more than Irelands hearts.
B0000DZEA1|5.0|Howard Shore reaches a new level with his score for the third Lord of the Rings film.  His work for the first film included some fine composing, particularly the delightful hobbit theme and the atmospheric work for Rivendell and Lothlorien, but was a bit heavy on loud action music.  His score for the second film was appropriately darker, notably in the strange and haunting Gollum's song. <BR> <BR>In the Return of the King, Shore bursts out with one memorable passage after another, showing an originality seldom if ever reached by composers of film scores.  Some of his work ranks with the most thrilling moments in classical compositions of the romantic era.  He creates an atmosphere of intense drama and heroic scale without the repetition that can kill momentum. <br /> The only letdown is at the end.  The farewell music in The Grey Havens is competent but not memorable.  The song Into the West, which won the academy award, features a fine melody but rather unimaginative lyrics.  Annie Lennox's voice is harsh in some passages, detracting from the elegaic quality appropriate to the end of this saga.  The song that should have won the Oscar was the one Enya sang for the first film.

B0001Z363W|2.0|First of all, I am a huge fan of Zakk Wylde. I thoroughly enjoyed his last album &quot;The Blessed Hellride,&quot; which had a good mix of ballads, heavy down tuned riff music and many examples of Mr. Wylde's technical brilliance. In case you didn't notice, his vocals have suffered since his album &quot;1919 Eternal.&quot; He's not a trained vocalist, and he doesn't necessarily care for his vocal chords. However, it's probably more due to all his drinking. Alcohol is not good for the liver, the brain, or this album. For those of you who think his voice is improving, just compare his current vocals to his Pride and Glory repertoire. His Zepplin cover really shows his talent and ability. He sounds worse than Ozzy these days. As for his guitar playing, he's never played faster. But, he's starting to recycle his licks. Although he still plays well in a jam session, I have to say, Hey Zakk, please start living up to your own standards!
0778320448|5.0|This is a heartwarming book about four very different women who come together in a knitting class.  It is classic Debbie Macomber, a compelling story that gives the reader hope for the future as each woman comes to terms with her lot in life, finds the gumption to succeed -- no matter what her aspirations -- and learns to understand and appreciate the people around her.  I'd love to see the story go on to the women in the next class.  I loved it!

B000096I9G|5.0|I dabbled in the Cure before Disentigration, but that album was what made me a Cure fan. This concert is great. The audio is good in 2.0 which really helped me out. (...).  Disentigration was a little less than one would expect but still is worth watching. I even liked some songs from Bloodflowers. The audio is good.  The look of the video is even better. I even liked the interviews. I normally avoid interviews. The encores are really good as well.
B0000089A1|5.0|Side A is the best side to any Kinks album, and taken together the two sides rank it among the best rock and roll albums ever.  &quot;Lola&quot; is perfect -- the riff, the chorus, but also the teasing ambiguity of the lyric, its double entendres capturing the essence of the subject matter.  But then &quot;Lola&quot; is followed by &quot;Top of the Pops&quot;, without doubt the funniest great three-chord rocker ever, and it's surrounded by a lot of other superb songs in a wide variety of styles, from Dave's obligatory hard rockers, to calypso (&quot;Apeman&quot;), to English music hall (&quot;Denmark Street&quot; and &quot;Money-Go-Round&quot;), and even the country-folk sound later explored in &quot;Muswell Hillbillies&quot; (&quot;Intro&quot; and &quot;Got to be Free&quot;).  The pacing of the track selection, especially on side A, is particularly satisfying.<br />There's a hint of a storyline (poor young man comes to big city and, after struggling as a day laborer, finds unexpected success as rock singer, only to find it doesn't solve life's problems), which is clearer than the story behind &quot;Arthur&quot; but not nearly as intrusive as that of &quot;Preservation&quot; or even &quot;Schoolboys in Disgrace&quot;.  And it's very, very funny -- how many rock and roll albums can you say that about?
B00009V8Z9|5.0|The first track I heard was 'meaning' in a GAP store in London. I had to wait until I got the name of the atrist. This album took me to another world completely and left goose bumps all over my body. The track 'Just Friends' relates to experiences I'm sure we've all had. Coming from Nigeria, I never thought that artists like Gavin existed. I thank God that he does because he is in a class of his own. I'd love to watch him live and wish he'd come up with another album.
1577311523|5.0|Eckhart Tolle is enlightened.  No, he can't shoot fireballs out of his arse or rise from the dead (as far as I know).  But he's got the secret- and the secret is awareness.<br />&quot;The Power of Now&quot; repackages traditional spiritual teachings in a format that even a skeptic can digest without too much discomfort.  Essentially, Tolle's entire message boils down to this- all of our major problems are caused by our lack of awareness and attention.  By keeping ourselves focused on the present and upon our body, rather than projecting into time with our mind, we can overcome our conflicts and create a saner world for ourselves and others.<br />Tolle isn't a fluffy &quot;white-lighter&quot;, however.  He's painfully aware of how sick and insane humanity is, and doesn't appear to have any illusions of how hard a task the one he presents is.  He simply presents an honest glimpse at the true nature of reality, in a manner that the Buddha, Bodhidharma, and Ramana Maharshi would certainly agree with.  At the very least, Tolle has written one of the clearest guides to overcoming depression and existential angst ever written.<br />I can't recommend it enough- The Power of Now is a book that anyone should read.  It can only help.
B00003CXCT|1.0|So I'm not the first to say this, and I won't be the last. WHY GEORGE WHY????????!!!!!!! Why destroy what was perfect? And it wasn't bad enough to rape the originals once, now he has to release a bastardized version of the bastardized versions. I'm sick, so I have to see the dvd versions, but I sure won't buy them. Mr Lucas, I'm sure you will never see this review, but if by some strange turn of events you do, why not just release two versions, the one you f**ked up, and the real, original one. You'll have the rare pleasure of making millions by selling actual $h!t, and you can at the same time double that by selling something that defined a generation as well. Release the originals also! Realistically, I'm going to have to dub the vhs onto dvd myself, and pretend this never happened.
B0000A9GLS|4.0|When I first started to watch this movie I wasn't sure if I would like it or not but once I got into it, it was pretty good. Totally different story line. If you like a good horror movie you will really like this one.
0553573403|5.0|This book is definately the best fantasy novel I have ever read. I have always prefered fantasy novels and that have a grim realism to them and this book is exactly that and more. It is actualy one of the best books I have ever read, ranked next to those by Gary Jennings. The Song of Ice and Fire is far better in my opinion that any other fantasy novel out there.
B00005A0N5|5.0|It is very powerful and inspiring music, I listen to it when need some more energy. It is fun to listen it driving in a sports car, really lifts your adrenalin level :) This albom is excellent also I recomment &quot;Century Child&quot; don't like much others.
B0000AQS0F|5.0|In an age where the viewing public is assaulted by unscripted TV shows - from &quot;Survivor&quot; to &quot;The Bachelor&quot; - it's rare to see a show come along that aims for genuine entertainment that combines great acting and writing with a team of visual experts who are not afraid to explore techniques that offer the viewer a different perspective.<br />Joss Whedon's &quot;Firefly&quot; is such a show.<br />While the fans despise network executives for canceling the show, I applaud the folks at FOX (though they did make some poor decisions afterward) for taking a chance on it - and giving us this DVD set. It's really, really good stuff. If you haven't seen it and appreciate good fiction, you're in for a treat. And being such a great creation, it is far from dead. I'll leave it to you to find out what BDM means.<br />Now for the negative, while I thoroughly enjoyed the series, I have friends who didn't and found it boring simply because of the lack of action. It's a legitimate complaint. If you don't enjoy characterization and want an unmemorable mind-numbing viewing experience along the lines of say, &quot;Knight Rider&quot; or &quot;Bill and Ted's Excellent Adventure&quot; - or if you're looking for something more realistic such as &quot;ER&quot; or &quot;CSI&quot; - this isn't for you.<br />However, if you're looking for something new and enjoy sci-fi and, in particularly, westerns, you likely will enjoy this feast. Only fourteen episodes, but stay tuned, there's more to come.
B000002MUW|5.0|For a kid growing up in the inner city, admitting to liking a pop artist is a sure-fire way to get you @ss kicked.  In 1994 the urban music landscape was cluttered with hip-hop acts like Notorious B.I.G., Wu-Tang Clan, 2Pac and R&amp;B like Mary J. Blige and TLC.  Madonna, an obvious observer of what's hot, decided to jump on the train with Bedtime Stories and make it cool to be a fan.   By picking the hottest R&amp;B producers of the year, Dallas Austin (TLC) and Babyface (Toni Braxton), Madonna made a great CD full of urban music.  From the Album opener Survival to the biggest single of her career Take A Bow, this album just simmers with heat.  Still an almost perfect addition to Madonna's collection and the only one I can play from beginning to end with no fast forward but a few rewinds.
B0000AQS0F|5.0|If you're a serious Buffy and Angel fan, you're probably curious about Joss Whedon's third television series, the short-lived Firefly, and if it's worth your time to check out, even after cancellation. I won't keep you in suspense - of COURSE it is. Let me give you some idea of what you're getting into if you buy this 4-DVD set:<P>Five hundred years in the future, humanity has spread into space, and the Alliance completes the Unification, i.e. forcible pacification of all planetary colonies resisting absorption under their rule, the so-called Independents. Malcolm Reynolds (Nathan Fillion) was an Independent Sergeant who, even in the final battle on his world against the Alliance, never gave up hope, still believed (wrongly) victory was possible, when his government and military pulled the plug on him, admitted defeat. Unwilling to live under Alliance rule, he and fellow soldier Zoe (Gina Torres) head for deep space as their last possible source of freedom. Thus the lines from the show's great intro tune, \\"Take my love, take my land/Take me where I cannot stand/I don't care, I'm still free/You can't take the sky from me.\\" Now Mal is captain of the Firefly-class transport ship Serenity, Zoe his second officer, existing outside the law, smugglers, thieves and scavengers trying to balance their need to make a living with a code of personal integrity that's an expensive trait in the life they lead.<P>This is not a blindingly original premise, the basic idea is old hat science fiction. But it doesn't really need to be original, anything can be done well or poorly, right? Fortunately, Whedon & Co. go straight for \\"well,\\" not even stopping at \\"poorly.\\"<P>Firefly's greatest strength is its cast of well-drawn characters. In addition to Mal and Zoe, crew and passengers on Serenity include:<P>\\"Wash\\" Warren (Alan Tudyk) is ship's pilot and Zoe's husband. He goes where his love goes, his personality alternating between a wacky sense of humor when at ease and extreme competence under pressure.<P>Inara Senna (Morena Baccarin) is a registered Companion, i.e. psychologist/counsellor/prostitute. Revered in some quarters as the highly trained, upper class professionals they are, condemned in others as common [prostitutes], she rents one of  Serenity's shuttles as her \\"office.\\"<P>It's hard to see Adam Baldwin in a t-shirt and fatique pants and not think \\"Animal Mother,\\" his role in Full Metal Jacket. Jayne Cobb is kind of like Animal Mother with the intensity control turned down from 10 to about 7, from absolute psychosis to extreme self-interest.<P>Kaylee aka Katwinnit Lee Frye (Jewel Staite) is ship's engineer, a charming gamine with a smudge of oil on her nose and a million mega-watt smile who's obviously, completely unaware she's beautiful and sexy.<P>Shortly into the first episode, Serenity takes on three passengers (extra cash and a cloak of respectability) who stay on as de facto crew themselves:<P>Two days out of an abbey, Shepherd Book (Ron Glass), a missionary, gets sucked into the world of Serenity. Problem: everyone else on board is either already religious or completely uninterested in what he's selling. The one exception, though he knows it not, is the most overtly anti-religious person on board, Mal Reynolds. Once extremely devout, Mal was a charismatic, inspired warrior who believed God was on his side in the fight against the Alliance. Since God betrayed him, he now hates God. Like the saying goes, \\"A cynic is a romantic who's been hurt.\\"<P>Simon Tam (Sean Maher), a doctor, becomes ship's medic. Born to aristocratic wealth and privilege, he threw away both to rescue his sister from an Alliance \\"academy,\\" an act that's left them both highly sought fugitives.<P>Finally there's River Tam (Summer Glau). Owning an IQ that looks like a zip code, Alliance experiments on her brain have (a) driven her insane, (b) unlocked psychic abilities.<P>Much has been written about the series pilot \\"Serenity\\" being the last episode aired due to network interference; how in Firefly Whedon takes conventions of the Western, transplanting them into outer space (the parallel between the Alliance Unification and the United States' Civil War is obvious); how this DVD set includes every Firefly episode ever completed, even three not actually aired; of Whedon's refusal to abandon the project and his work on a Firefly movie. So I won't discuss all that (I'm coming to end of my allotted 1,000 words); you can read about it elsewhere. I'll just say this is one of the best television shows ever, the DVD set is priced to own with hoards of cool \\"extras,\\" and if you buy it, you will love it. 'Nuff said.
B00004YA66|5.0|With a little extra spending money I picked up a few DVD's 'to take a chance on', hoping for one gold nugget. Well, this one is just that. I have watched it several times in a few months, and have made a point of lending it out to my friends simply saying 'trust me, you'll enjoy it'. It has come back each time with positive to glowing reviews, and a smile showing each person did enjoy it.<BR>   The script is well thought out! Tell me how many times you've watched a movie that seemed to have been roughed out on a napkin the night before they started filming? The story moves forward with... a couple surprises/twists that fit perfectly into the storyline, but doesn't overshadow the identification with and the developement of the characters. Great casting. I have been a Dennis Quaid fans for over a decade, and Jim Cavieziel was a pleasant discovery for me.<BR>    I missed this in the theatre. Not too many people went to see it. Man, I might have missed it altogther had I not had a few dollars to spend... and in this case, that would have been a bad thing. You'll enjoy it, trust me.
B0000028UK|3.0|Alright folks, why oh why does a song like &quot;Daughter&quot; get on the radio? The chorus for daughter sounds like a complete joke! Pearl Jam is overrated. There is music far better than this but because the &quot;alternative rock radio stations&quot; won't play more than just a few select bands most listeners will continue to be spoon fed by the media. <br />There is so much more to music than Pearl Jam, Nirvana, Alice in Chains (although they were pretty good) and Stone Temple Pilots. <br />Try listening to bands much more unique and deep like ORPHANED LAND, VISIONAIRE, KATATONIA, and PINK FLOYD!<BR>Those are the bands that are treading new ground and producing depth and mystery, but because the Radio won't play them you won't hear them. (Pink floyd being the exception of course).<br />There is some redemptive value here on Pearl Jam but the above mentioned bands I like are way more interesting and will last for all time.
B0000CABBW|5.0|I found \\"Whale Rider\\" to be a nice surprise.  It doesn't cater to our lower nature at all ... quite rare in today's movie making ... but concentrates on family and tradition instead.<br /><br />It is the story of a Maori family living in a New Zealand village ... a family that had, for generations, provided the local Maori population with its spiritual leader ... always a male ... who, as tradition has it, is able to ride, yep, whales.  The youngest generation has no male to offer, only a young girl.  Strife naturally occurs, and the story is an unfolding of the initial resentment and then begrudged acceptance of this girl ... after it is demonstrated that destiny is on her side.<br /><br />Keisha Castle-Hughes plays the young girl, and she is excellent.  Rawiri Paratene plays her grumpy grandfather, and he is good too.  All the characters are true-to-life ... nothing is sugar coated ... and this is quite a departure from your normal cinematic fare.<br /><br />There is quite a bit of ... psychological violence ... coming out of the grandfather character.  He is quite mean to the girl ... all in the name of tradition ... and I didn't go for that at all.  She takes it like a little champion, however, and prevails in the end.<br /><br />It would have been a much better movie if the grandfather had had ... love in himself to give ... instead of the rigid (and senseless) demands of ancestry.  A nice balance (between his love for his grand-daughter and his concern for tradition) could have been maintained ... and this would have made the final victory all the more sweet.<br /><br />As it is, there are quite a few scenes that are unsettling ... not the least of which is the opening one.  But it is an inspiring movie at heart, and yes, she does actually ride a whale.
B000008LOV|5.0|The Traveling Wilburys will go down in history as one of the best, if not the best, short lived bands. With a chance meeting that caused the formation of the band, to the worldwide acceptance of their music, to the death of the &quot;key&quot; band members and the suicide of replacement Del Shannon this was a tragic band to say the least. Lawsuits that has stopped any further releases in the US, even though the band still has a website and the remaining members still refer to themselves as &quot;Wilburys&quot;.<BR>The only way to enjoy their genius of music now is to find a domestic used copy or an Import (legal from from countries that had production releases from the beginning) and from one bootleg commonly known as vol 4 1/2 (a Russian release) neverless a great sound quality release.<BR>I have researched many years and found a total of only 7 or 8 really well produced CD's with just about everything the Wilburys recorded.<br />Vol 1 Usa Release ***** (Five Stars)<BR>Vol 3 Usa Release ****<br />Vol 1 &amp; 3 Import (Japan)*****<BR>Vol 1 &amp; 3 Import (Russian)***<BR>Vol 2 &amp; 4 1/2 Import (Russian)***<BR>Recovered Treasures Vol 1&amp;3 *****((First takes, outakes and unreleased songs &quot;B&quot; sides<BR>Wilburys &quot;Live in Concert&quot; ***** (Five stars easily for the sound quality and workmanship put into making this CD with great vocals and crowd noise)Which sounds fantastic but never occured since they never toured.<BR>and a handful of other outakes and alternates from the Warner in house tapes, that were never released.<br />It makes you wonder why they don't capitalize in the US on all this wealth of material being produced by other countries. If they have it, surely Warner Bros or Wilbury records (same) would have the same material.<br />Hopefully they will come together and remaster the originals, maybe even HDCD, It deserves it.

B0000AQS0F|5.0|Not sure what the executives at Fox were thinking when they micro-managed this puppy right into the ground and then canceled it.  I'm a middle-of-the road sci-fi fan, but even apart from the &quot;sci-fi&quot; label, this show was/is extremely well-written and extremely well-acted, something SO many shows can't actually boast.<br />I didn't actually see this when it aired other than maybe 10 minutes one night when I was channel surfing, and I later moved overseas, so I had NO chance to see it after that.  What prompted me to buy it was I remembered the previews to the show and thinking it looked cool, and mostly a review written about the DVD collection, and how unfortunate it was that the show was canceled.  And here I am writing pretty much the same thing.<br />Yeah, even though the premise (a western in the future, basically) and some of the plots are a little cheesy, the acting and writing pulls it together.  And there are weaker members of the cast, but as a whole supporting team, they also gelled pretty well.<br />Very unfortunate that the Fox executives didn't see the potential rapport this show would build with the audience.  But so it goes.  They're out to make money, and if they're conditioned by the expectations of brain-dead couch potatoes, then they'll try to deliver the product they think the brain-dead couch potatoes want.  It is a business afterall.<br />If you like Farscape or Picard/Voyager-era Star Trek, you'll like this.  With the exception of a few choice Star Trek episodes, I'd say Firefly is even better.
0385336810|4.0|This book was my first Sophie Kinsella attempt, and I loved it!  Emma Corrigan was the kind of &quot;heroine&quot; that's fun to read about, but also is what you really want in a heroine.  Her loose tongue to the man who turns out to be her boss was hilarious.  I would definitely recommend this book to anyone who wanted a quick, funny read!
B000002RXS|5.0|There are so many Carmen-recordings, every mezzo, contralto and even sopranos attempted it, even coloratura-sopranos like Patti (The only flop in her illustrious career) and Sills (Sadly miscast, she was better in Massenet) tackled the role. Yet the truly great Carmens can be counted on one, well, maybe two hands. The earliest recording, featuring dramatic soprano Emmy Destinn is amazing but not in great sound (Obviously). The next great Carmen would be Rise Stevens, in a rather unknown studio-recording. I prefer her live-recording by a long shot. A seductive, dark mezzo of rarely matched beauty. After this Victoria de los Angeles takes the crown. The Spanish Falcon-soprano, who was also a sublime Charlotte (Only Vallin was even greater) was an elegant, velvet-like, seductive gypsy with cold elegance. A very refined portrait of a character that has been portrayed as a slut way too often. The most fabulous Italian Carmen is without a doubt Giulietta Simionato whose live-recordings with di Stefano and Corelli thrill, excite and seduce with their fire, lust and passion. And then came Maria Callas, a Greek soprano whose repertoire was that of a true soprano sfogato, anything from belcanto to Wagner's Isolde and Brnnhilde could be found there. She had been approached to do Eboli, Carmen, Dalilah, Marie (!) and other roles she sadly never sang on stage. Callas describes Bizet's Carmen vs. the original Carmen as described in Prosper Merimee's novel. Her Carmen has elements of both. The independent lust for freedom, the way she drives men to insanity cruelly, how she uses and manipulates them with her charms only to abandon them after a short time. Escamillo, her last lover clearly states that Carmen's \\"love\\" is short-lived. And that is what we hear in Callas' portrayal. When obeyed she oozes charm and sexual energy, when opposed or held she breathes fire. Her Carmen finds her man's weakness and thrusts her vocal dagger into it without mercy and when she has won him over at last she purrs like a kitten. Her habanera is not a song for men, it is the philosophy of her life without a care in the world. She defies life and death and Callas, who sounded so light and tender as Amina sounds dark, luscious and haunting here. Her segeduilla has the nature of the heartless seductress. For her freedom she is willing to do anything. As she says later when someone askes her why she's in love with him: \\"He's a pretty boy and he pleases me!\\". In the gypsy song we hear one of the hottest scene ever recorded in the studio. Callas' fierce \\"Tralala!\\" is almost orgasmic. Imagine her, the dark beauty that she was, dancing this scene! In the love-scene she first toys with him, when he has to obey the bugle-call she mocks him, tortures him. This is responded to with Don Jos's flower-song, one of the sweetest arias imaginable. But Carmen is not satisfied. He must come with her! Notice how Callas' sounds dangerously fierce, yet warm and smooth on \\"La librt!\\". As we hear the third act only a shadow of her desire remains. She sounds positively annoyed with him and when Escamillo comes her voice blooms to new beautiful heights despite the forlorn, even sad tone of the card-aria before where Carmen sees her own death in the cards. Act four contains some of the most glorious singing Callas ever recorded. Observing the tenderness in the short love-duet with Escamillo I assume that Carmen is truly in love for the first time. There is no danger in her voice, just love. But the confrontation with Don Jos who went with his former friend and fiance to console his dying mother had to come. In this duet we hear Callas at her wildest, proudest and most defying. She treats him coldly, the only time we hear a glint of feeling is in her confession of loving Escamillo. The more Don Jos begs, threatens or cries, the colder and distant Callas' Carmen becomes. When he kills her after Carmen throwing the ring into his face there is a void, everything sounds so forlorn and tragic with Carmen gone forever. Callas may not be a natural mezzo like Stignani, Cossotto or Baltsa but she, like Price after her and Ponselle before her brought a unique, fatally charming character to life. Being surrounded not only by the best Don Jos on records, Nicolai Gedda, but also by the shamefully underrated Giuot as Michaela whose warm, sweet and innocent soprano is made for Michaela and the brilliant Massard, the fabulous Rigoletto and Athanael from the Rigoletto and Thais recordings with the divine Renee Doria nothing can go wrong. Pretre conducts with verve and elegance, the sound is absolutely glorious. Do not miss this Carmen, it's an amazing experience!

B000007OY0|5.0|At the heart of this extraordinary movie is a brilliant and indelible performance by Morgan Freeman as Red, the man who knows how to get things, the \\"only\\" guilty man at Shawshank prison.  He was nominated by the Academy for Best Actor in 1995 but didn't win.  (Tom Hanks won for Forrest Gump.)  What Freeman does so beautifully is to slightly underplay the part so that the eternal boredom and cynicism of the lifer comes through, and yet we can see how very much alive with the warmth of life the man is despite his confinement.  Someday Morgan Freeman is going to win an Academy Award and it will be in belated recognition for this performance, which I think was a little too subtle for some Academy members to fully appreciate at the time.<br />But Freeman is not alone.  Tim Robbins plays the hero of the story, banker Andy Dufresne, who has been falsely convicted of murdering his wife and her lover.  Robbins has a unique quality as an actor in that he lends ever so slightly a bemused irony to the characters he plays.  It is as though part of him is amused at what he is doing.  I believe this is the best performance of his career, but it might be compared with his work in The Player (1992), another excellent movie, and in Mystic River (2003) for which he won an Oscar as Best Supporting Actor.<br />It is said that every good story needs a villain, and in the Bible-quoting, Bible-thumping, massively hypocritical, sadistic Warden Samuel Norton, played perfectly by Bob Gunton, we have a doozy.  I want to tell you that Norton is so evil that fundamentalist Christians actually hate this movie because of how precisely his vile character is revealed.  They also hate the movie because of its depiction of violent, predatory homosexual behavior (which is the reason the movie is rated R).  On the wall of his office (hiding his safe with its ill-gotten contents and duplicitous accounts) is a framed plaque of the words \\"His judgment cometh and that right soon.\\"  The irony of these words as they apply to the men in the prison and ultimately to the warden himself is just perfect.  You will take delight, I promise.<br />Here is some other information about the movie that may interest you.  As most people know, it was adapted  from a novella by Stephen King entitled \\"Rita Hayworth and the Shawshank Redemption.\\"  Rita Hayworth figures in the story because Red procures a poster of her for Andy that he pins up on the wall of his cell.  The poster is a still from the film Gilda (1946) starring her and Glenn Ford.  We see a clip from the black and white film as the prisoners watch, cheering and hollering when Rita Hayworth appears.  If you haven't seen her, check out that old movie.  She really is gorgeous and a forerunner of Marilyn Monroe, who next appears on Andy's wall in a still from The Seven Year Itch (1955).  It's the famous shot of her in which her skirt is blown up to reveal her shapely legs.  Following her on Andy's wall (and, by the way, these pinups figure prominently in the plot) is Rachel Welsh from One Million Years B.C. (1966).  In a simple and effective device these pinups show us graphically how long Andy and Red have been pining away.<br />Frank Darabont's direction is full of similar devices that clearly and naturally tell the story.  There is Brooks (James Whitmore) who gets out after fifty years but is so institutionalized that he can't cope with life on the outside and hangs himself.  Playing off of this is Red's periodic appearance before the parole board where his parole is summarily REJECTED.  Watch how this plays out at the end.<br />The cinematography by Roger Deakins is excellent.  The editing superb: there's not a single dead spot in the whole movie.  The difference between the good guys (Red, Andy, Brooks, etc.) and the bad guys (the warden, the guards, the \\"sisters,\\" etc.) is perhaps too starkly drawn, and perhaps Andy is a bit too heroic and determined beyond what might be realistic, and perhaps the \\"redemption\\" is a bit too miraculous in how beautifully it works out.  But never mind.  We love it.<br />All in all this is a great story vividly told that will leave you with a true sense of redemption in your soul.  It is not a chick flick, and that is an understatement.  It is a male bonding movie about friendship and the strength of character, about going up against what is wrong and unfair and coming out on top through pure true grit and a little luck.<br />Bottom line: one of the best ever made, currently rated #2 (behind The Godfather) at the IMDb.  Don't miss it.oo miraculous in how beautifully it works out.  But never mind.

B000002UYZ|1.0|I've been a diehard Beatles fan for years &amp; i must say that this is a shotty ripoff!!, these 2 discs could have easilly fit on one disc &amp; at a much lower price for that matter. P.S., when in the hell are the remasters coming out Capitol? the U.K. releases are too muddy sounding.
B0001W8Q9Y|4.0|For those unaware, Marillion has harnessed the power of the internet and their rabid cult following to come up with an innovative concept: two versions of Marbles (one for retail chains, one to be ordered directly from the band, initially to raise funds for marketing). <br />What anyone considering Marbles needs to know is that the epic, Ocean Cloud, the crown jewel of the 2CD release (which has a spectacular 128 book to it), is not on the single CD version. This is incredible to me, and any current Marillion fan who appreciates the majesty of &quot;Misplaced Childhood,&quot; &quot;Brave&quot; and &quot;This Strange Engine&quot; will be missing out on another pinnacle moment in Marillion's recording career if they opt to save a few bucks and get the single CD version.<br />Maybe it was left off to further distance Marillion from that dreaded &quot;prog&quot; label. Maybe they wanted to keep something special for the loyal fans. Or maybe they just didn't realize what an incredible track it is. Either way, I implore anyone who wants to buy Marbles to get the 2Cd version.<br />The band has evolved once again. This time, it's very moody and vibey, with shades of Afraid of Sunlight and Brave. Production is better than .com for sure. H puts in one of his most artisitc performances (I swear he's hitting some seriously forbidden substances pretty hard when he's recording). Rothery seems to have remembered he's a guitar player on this album, and his performances and solos are a welcome return to the better days of Marillion, especially on Ocean Cloud and Neverland. Mark Kelly provides lots of sonic candy and variety, and Pete Trewavas delivers a new level of background vocal excellence on this CD.  A couple of the tracks are misses, but Invisible Man, Fantastic Place, Ocean Cloud, Don't Hurt Yourself and Neverland are all outstanding. As I said before, Ocean Cloud is worth the price of admission, and the 2CD packaging is stellar.
B00003CX5P|5.0|i can almost count the years when the movie was first anounce and put in development i had high hopes with the advancements in cgi and technology i was expecting a grand specticle, it was but the acting killed the movie. and the writing didnt help either.  what made the original trilogy great was the characters. you had an intergalatic war, yes but it was revolving around these characters you actually care what happens to them and without that it just another movie. the kid in the movie cannot act to save his life, and jar jar should not have even been in the movie, if george lucas was trying to get a sidekick like chewie was, he should have tried harder.  great special effects but time and money should have gone into the writing and better actors.
B00005OM4N|5.0|I can't stop listening to this CD!!! Britney showcases this cd with a more grown up style and it's some of her best material yet. All the single's ,I'm a slave 4 u to Overprotected and Cinderella rock. This cd will stay in your player for days. Britney I'm a slave 4 your music.

B000000WFF|3.0|For the music part the only good song is Spice up your life.<br />The rest are out of touch and out of sight. They are to lazy to make a full album of at least 14 tracks or more this sucks.
B00005JMFQ|2.0|I found this movie very disappointing. It tries so hard to be cute and funny, stuffing over 5 different love stories into one short movie. What we get is a set of underdeveloped one dimensional characters, underdeveloped plot lines, and ultimately a very forgettable romanitc comedy. Frankly, I felt it was a waste of time and money. The only redeeming parts were Colin Firth's appearance (although he was on camera far too little) and the cute love story with the little elementary aged boy and his crush. Some stories that needed development were left to shrivel up. All in all, it is a snack of a film, like eating one M&amp;M...sweet but woefully unsatisfying.
B000002JK2|5.0|This is one of those albums that I constantly have in a cd player.  &quot;Street in the City&quot; is spectacular.  I love all of Pete's work that is accompanied by his father and brother-in-laws' string arrangements.  The band lineup is great as well with Charlie Watts, Clapton on a song or two and Rabbit on keyboards.  &quot;Keep Me Turning&quot; is another standout-as easy a recognizable Pete song as there is.  This album is truly a hidden gem that rates on par with Pete's other solo material.
B000001GQD|5.0|Richter's performance on this cd reminds me very much of Rush's 2112 album. You are captivated from the moment you hit play, and you are taken on a journey. But by the end, you realize that every time you will pay it another visit, you will discover a whole new world of aesthetics that you had no prior perception of. Not just compositionally, but the same goes for what Richter's soul has to say. It's like getting two stories in one! This may initially sound ironic, given that his devilishly careful, almost brooding pacing, finds many listeners opting for Ashkenazy's spin. However, for me, the more thoughtful ... a performance is, the more intricacies there are to be found. When you listen to Rush, you barely get anything from the first listen... but you just KNOW that there IS an eternity of SOMETHING to be gathered, if you listen over and over again. So, in either case, you become strangely obsessed and fixated, drawn to listen just one more time. I suppose to really go out there, I will compare Richter to an artistic bag of potato chips. You must just keep going. That's not to say you get nothing from the first listen! Indeed, those familiar with the concerto and/or Richter will be blown away, regardless. But with every chord of the 1st movement of the Rach 2nd, you sense a world of unspoken stories, meaning, content! Warning, though - if you don't like being analytical, this isn't the recording for you. People complain of orchestral faults, injections of political issues, etc. etc.... but what captivates me every time I listen to Richter, is how superb he is at upping the ante for the utopian combination of brains and emotion. ... The same is to be said for the Tchaikovsky. Whatever stressors surround the nature of the recording, a true musician puts it all aside (OR uses it as fuel to the fire!) and performs a miracle at the piano. If you are openminded, buy this - you won't be disappointed. Rather,... you'll become addicted.

B000003TA4|1.0|Having lived through the early 90's and not heard all of Nevermind, my pal recommended it to me. I bought the CD recently, and even at its reasonably low price, I must vent this: I was gypped. &quot;Smells Like Teen Spirit&quot; was always a cheesy song, but it's the nostalgia that kept me coming back to it. It was played EVERYWHERE between 1991 and 1994. I remember it being played at our High School pep rallies to get us already-hyper kids riled up for the big game. A year before that, I remember it being played at dances constantly the final year of Middle School circa '92. I still love that song, but now that I've heard a Nirvana disc in full, I realize that I don't love it because it was done by Nirvana-- I love it because of the memories the song is attached to. Somehow, &quot;Smells Like Teen Spirit&quot; made those &quot;lame&quot; school functions and us 13 year-olds cool. That sums up the audience for Nirvana's Nevermind: Middle-High School kids who want to be &quot;cool&quot; (yes, that included me in 1992). Just get music to be yourself instead. You'll be happier. As far as any meat to the music or lyrics on Nevermind: Look somewhere else (preferably a genre other than Nirvana's Jock Rock). If you think SLTS is cheesy, wait 'til you get an earful of &quot;Breed&quot;. It consists of nearly one line of &quot;She said&quot; barked 25 times.&quot;Stay Away&quot; is even cheesier, and consists of the words &quot;stay away&quot; shouted 30 times. &quot;Territorial Pissings&quot; is a good way to blow your lungs out if you're stupid enough to scream along to a song that's so cliched. &quot;Polly&quot; and &quot;Something in the Way&quot; are two huge bores. Whomever keeps generously giving Nirvana five stars and a supposed status of &quot;legendary&quot; is undoubtedly the way I was when I was going through my pre-mid teens. But I can assure those inexperienced ones that they'll grow up and out of Nirvana. Yes, I lost my love of flannel and complaining about how my life &quot;sucked&quot; despite the fact I had it easy. However, I did gain musical taste in return--my OWN personal, individual musical taste. When I grew out of SLTS, I discovered an amazing gritty-electronica album in 1997 called &quot;Ultra&quot; by Depeche Mode. It includes some songs with a nice, gritty feel, but without all the cheesiness that Nirvana had. Be sure to check out these Depeche Mode &quot;Ultra&quot; songs just to be open-minded even if you've self-proclaimed and branded yourself as a Grungie: &quot;Barrel of a Gun&quot;, &quot;It's No Good&quot;, &quot;Insight&quot; and &quot;Useless&quot;.
B0001XAS1W|5.0|I've recently rediscovered this gem from the 70's.  What a treat!<br />Happy, often joyous, alternately somber, tense or exciting melodies, and stories, yes, stories!  Far too richly-produced and fully instrumented (with the able assistance of Alan Parsons, experienced from his work on classics like Abbey Road and Dark Side Of The Moon) to be called folk music, Al Stewart spins historical and personal tales with the best of the folk singers.<br />One warning - these are songs that may inspire you to fill your own life with adventure!<br />Though many regard Al Stewart as a folk/rock singer, no folk music fires me up like this!  Highly recommended.
0393019217|5.0|To borrow the phrase from MTV this is Feynman unplugged. <br />I really enjoyed his commencement talk that is last chapter in the book. He exhorts his listeners to create real empirically supportable results in their research. There is a new kind of scientist in our midst that I feel Dr. Feynman would have detested. This kind of scientist is less interested in the reality of what is being studied and more interested in advancing a certain agenda. There is a great web site (junkscience^com) that catalogues many of these scientific gunslingers.<br />This book is a retrospective that begins at the beginning and finishes in 1974 (many years before his report on the Challenger accident). It describes his early years working in a hotel, going to MIT, working at Los Alamos, and teaching at Cornell and Caltech. There are many demonstrations of his wicked wit and quirky (quarky?) sense of humor. He is quick to seize  the opportunity to use his wit as is shown when he hides a door in his fraternity house. <br />This is a fun read!
B00005JKJA|1.0|I'll probably get alot of \\"unhelpfull\\" about this review but I'm going to state MY OPINION about David Lynch JUNK MOVIES and the \\"warping of his viewer's minds\\" into THINKING or believing they just seen a great \\"artistic\\" movie.  How anybody can call this movie \\"artistic\\" is beyond me. I just don't get it.  David Lynch can take dog doo and make a movie out of it and his \\"fanatic fans\\" will \\"analyze it\\" and make something out of a \\"nothing coherent story\\". \\"Mullholand Drive\\" in MY OPINION IS just that, a story with not much of a story. I've read numerous reviews on this movie just to TRY and understand WHY people liked this movie. I am glad for those people out there that enjoyed it and found it intresting or entertaining and \\"facinating\\", but I found it VERY SLOW, dull and not to mention very boring.  David Lynch's REAL GOOD movies such as, \\"Blue Velvet\\", \\"Twin Peaks: Fire Walk With Me\\", and \\"Wild At Heart\\" had depth, good story telling, and most imortantly,---as an average film go'er, I could \\"FOLLOW\\" what the heck is going on, unlike this movie or his last one \\"Lost Highway\\". I was waiting impatiently to see a GOOD David Lynch movie, then this one came out. However, after surviving through, and most importantly,--wasting over 4 hours of my life watching his last 2 UNEXPLANABLE \\"non-artistic\\" garbage of movies--\\"Lost Higway\\" & \\"Mullholand Drive\\", I am so disgusted with David Lynch being \\"high on himself\\" and his non-coherent movies, that I will probably never see another one of his movies.  I THINK (in my opinion), David Lynch must THINK his movies are \\"art work\\", and has been sucessful enough to make himself believe that he is \\"A legend in his own mind\\" or something, and is unfortunatly allowed by Hollywood to make anything he wants on film. And most importantly or sadly, Hollywood allows this because HIS FANS buy tickets to see this kind of bologna nothing-makes-sence story making. They (Lynch fans) come out in amazement of what they witnessed. How extrodinary itwas. Love to ANALYZE his \\"Art work\\", and they figure out a way to explain Lynch's own madness of suppossed film making when it's actually garbage. No way will the Lynch fan admit the movie stinks. Even if mediocre at least. They just call it \\"artistic film making\\" when it stinks. I guess that is what Lynch's version of \\"Dune\\" was. Another fine work of his art.  Me, I just don't get it I guess. In this latest BOMB, I was more bored than \\"Lost Highway\\". Don't get me wrong, I do love Lynch's GOOD movies of \\"Twin Peaks\\", Wild At Heart\\", and \\"Blue Velvet\\". BUT, David Lynch's success from just those 3 movies has blinded his current and latest attempts at film making, even worse than his first bomb \\"Dune\\".  I know I'll get alot of flack for this review but as a movie go'er (and in my opinion) I want to be entertained. I don't mind having to think about what's going on in a movie (some movies have been excellent in that regards), but to try and figure out what's going on in a director's mind or some writter's mind that doesn't come out coherent by the end, doesn't entertain & makes for a bad movie. I believe that Lynch probably didn't have anything written down or no actual script when he filmed \\"Mullholand Drive\\". I think he must have been allowed by the studio to just film away knowing that his fanatic fans will buy into anything he puts on film. Coherent or especially non-coherent. IN MY OPINION this movie bored me to death and had nothing to offer except cheesy lesbian scenes to titilate those that might give up trying to figure out what the heck is going on during this overly long slow paced B-rate movie that should've ended up as a TV Movie on the Playboy Channel.
B00006J9OT|5.0|This album finds Diana Krall in rare form. The arrangements are unbelievable, the singing and playing are just heavenly!
B00004Z4WQ|2.0|THE PLOT:  There wasn't much of one...  It's basically about these teens who accidentally kill this guy, and 2 of them go insane from it.  And then, a charecter that we don't know who (I won't ruin it, but it makes no sense), starts killing people off for no apparent reason.  Then, he gets away.  The end.<br />MY OPINION:  The movie was WAY overrated.  Scary Movie 3 was hilarious, because it had different screenwriters.  This movie was pretty much just disgusting throughout the entire thing.  Skip it and move on to 3, please.  <br />SPECIAL FEATURES:  The spcieal features were almost aas bad as the movie itself (I won't go that far, because that would just be MEAN).<br />OVERALL RATING:  D.
0156027321|5.0|Pi is a devout Christian, Hindu and Muslim.  It may seem paradoxical, but to Pi God can wear different faces; after all what is reality other than a series of stories that you tell yourself to explain your observations?  So when Pi is forced to explain how he survived months at sea, he tells two wildly different stories, and when you realize that both are true and untrue, every moment of the book comes together with perfect clarity.  A true masterpiece.

B00003CXCT|1.0|Whooossshhh! That is the sound of a series I once loved being flushed down the toilet like the turd it has become. George Lucas destroyed this beloved series when he redid the effects and altered scenes. You never, never, NEVER mess with a classic. My advice, don't bother with this DVD set. Stick with the VHS tapes you bought before Lucas went insane. Maybe the low sales of the DVDs will persuade Lucas to release the original versions on DVD.

B000005JA8|5.0|Trout Mask Replica is just pure genius by a madman. The interesting part of the one star reviews is that they are all in batches on the same dates.<br />In other words one or two individuals is simply creating several Amazon accounts and voting one star reviews for Trout Mask Replica. Very few of the one star reviews have actual pages for their reviewers. Hmmm. Nice integrity.<br />As usual Amazon won't do anything about it.<br />Try this difficult but extremely rewarding album. It is genius.
B00009W0U4|4.0|If I were to rate this movie based on how it made me feel, then I would have given it one star instead of 4 stars, but that would not be fair to the director &amp; actors.  The movie achieves what was intended by the director, which really challenged my senses. The rape scene left me numb &amp; stunned.  I understand why many people got up and left the theater during that 10-min scene because it's so realistic &amp; brutal unlike anything I've seen before.  The movie left me so unsatisfied, which I think is why many viewers gave this a low rating because a high rating might sound like they enjoyed watching the movie.  I wanted the satisfaction of seeing revenge on the rapist, but instead the wrong man was brutally murdered and the man (Alex's ex-boy friend) was going to spend yrs in prison as a result of it.  I kept hoping for someone to walk through the underpass and disrupted the rape but that did not happen.  After the rape, I felt sick watching the woman dragging herself away and held my breath for the rapist to let her go.  Instead he brutalized her in a way as shocking &amp; sickening as during the rape.   As much as we don't want to acknowlege it, the sickening acts portrayed in this movie do happen in real life.  Also, how many times in real life have we seen a trivial decision (such as the woman's decision to leave the party early by herself) led to some event that turned one's life totally upside down?  I give 5 stars to the superb acting throughout the movie (esp the rape scene).  I felt like those people weren't acting at all.  I do agree w/ other viewers that the rotating camera angle during the 1st 30 minutes is just way overdone &amp; totally unnecessary (which is why 4 instead of 5 stars).
B000002VCO|3.0|Track 1 &quot;Prime Time&quot; is the undoubted best with Woolfson and the melodic keys and beat much like earlier Parson's songs.  The others are just okay.  Don't answer Me is a Pop song and I don't care for it.  Buy the &quot;Definitive Collection&quot; instead of this albumn.
B00005JLXE|4.0|Daredevil was, at first, a new character to me. His comic books, when they were first released, did stir some emotion. Yet, I don't believe it was as good as Spiderman or the other Marvel characters. However, this movie is in relation to Daredevil and knowing that movies made by Marvel is worth seeing, I took a chance and watched the DVD. I have no regrets or second thoughts about the movie. It wasn't exactly breathtaking or exhilirating, but the story and plot was well stated and shown. The story of a 12-year old boy being blinded by biohazardous waste, losing his father at 12, becoming a successful lawyer, and New York's vigilante hero is an interesting story. Showing the different periods of his life, the movie made smooth transition through time. Overall, the movie was well made and is a worthy collectors item for Marvel fans.

B0000AQVCL|4.0|As a self-admitted pop-music snob who is partial to the classics and closeminded to just about everything post 1985, I was really surprised by Jet's debut, Get Born.<br />Like many, I was introduced to Jet from their song placement on the iPod commercial.  But I only picked up their album after having my arm twisted by a respected friend.  And while Jet may be a modern band (all in their early 20's), I surprisingly enjoyed Get Born from the very first time I hit play.<br />Aside from their obvious energy, and strong musicianship, what makes Jet stand out for me are the booming lead vocals (think Mike Smith of the Dave Clark 5), and their good taste in musical influences (AC/DC, ELO, Beatles, Kinks and Stones).<br />The best ballad, Look What You've Done is amazingly borrowed from ELO (Can't Get It Out Of My Head), yet it sounds fresh and touching.  (Also note this song's lyrics, 'borrowed from the Beatles' Sexy Sady').  If I didn't know better, I'd think it was a young Jeff Lynne signing at the outset.<br />Roll Over DJ may borrow from BTO's Taking Care of Business, but it has an edge to it that makes the song instantly enjoyable.<br />Are You Gonna Be My Girl, is a simple straightforward Rocker that knocks you over with pure energy, even if lyrically challenged.  It is potentially a modern-day 'I Saw Her Standing There' with its attitude and simplicity.<br />Lazy Gun is another standout.  It sounds like a fusion of two different songs diametrically opposed (think the Beatles A Day in the Life).  It isn't a classic, but the dreamy vocals and harmonies in the songs chorus are superb.<br />Overall, Get Born is one of the most promising debut albums by a new rock band since REM and U2 in the early 80's.  Granted, Jet is a work in progress and Get Born is an imperfect collectiion.  But the manifestation of musical and vocal talent is plainly obvious.  It should be most interesting to see where Jet evolves to in their sophmore effort.<br />Get Born could be the start ofthe next big thing in Rock & Roll.

B0001Z53AQ|5.0|D12 World is a great CD, and represents one of their best efforts.  Tracks like &quot;40 oz,&quot; &quot;How Come,&quot; and &quot;American Pyscho 2&quot; illustrate their talent for lyrics.

0345451325|5.0|As a person who enjoys reading and playing video games, I think that it really is a good idea to continue the stories of our favorite games in different forms of media. Just to clue everyone in, Halo is the story of the Master Chief, a cybernetically enhanced soldier who is humanity's best chance against a collective of alien races, known as the Covenant, who are bent on destroying the human race. The first book, part one of a trilogy, tells how the Chief, as a young boy, along with other children, were abducted from their parents and trained from the age of six to be the greatest soldiers in history. Eventually, the Covenant attack Earth's various planet colonies, and the soldiers, codenamed &quot;Spartans,&quot; are the only thing that can save humanity. This is an enthralling read, especially for fans of the game, but even those who haven't played the game will surely be pleased with this tale of hardships, sacrifice, loss, and war.

0375433074|5.0|John Grisham's latest, THE LAST JUROR, is his first novel since A TIME TO KILL to be sent in Ford County, Mississippi . . .<br />I've never been to the either the fictional setting or state, but it sure feels like I know it from reading this latest legal thriller . . . the characters all come alive, in large part because the author is so talented in using dialogue that helps move the pace along at near-breakneck speed.<br />JUROR is about a 23-year old college dropout who assumes ownership of a once bankrupt newspaper . . . when a brutal murder occurs, circulation increases as all the gruesome<br />details are reported . . . when the murderer is released after<br />nine years because in Mississippi in 1970, &quot;life didn't necessarily mean life,&quot; all hell breaks loose.<br />I really feel like I got to know Willie Traynor, as well as many<br />of his colorful friends and acquaintances . . . in addition, I<br />liked the book's ending . . . Grisham--after a few disappointing<br />efforts--returns my list of authors whose books I will seek<br />out when they first get published.
B00004TH7Z|5.0|I had almost given up on Iron Maiden ever releasing another album after Blaze Bayley took over as vocalist after 'Fear of the Dark'. IM had been going downhill a little since Seventh Son... and then Bruce Dickinson left and IM released two albums I just couldn't really stand (but have recently given them second chances and liked them). Not that 'X-Factor' and 'Virtual XI' were wastes of time, it's just that I was ticked off that Bruce had left and might not be coming back...<br />Then 'Brave New World' was released and I heard &quot;The Wicker Man&quot; on the radio and thought, &quot;Who the hell is that that sounds like Iron Maiden/Bruce Dickinson?!&quot; I couldn't believe it. I did a quick search on Amazon.com and found this album, almost 4 years ago now. I still pull this album out almost on a weekly basis and listen to it, and I still can't believe how they've recaptured the &quot;old sound&quot; from their earlier days. This album is a masterpiece that never gets old. By far my favorite album they've ever released, I'm now just hoping they will be able to release another one soon and be able to at least come close to it. And if not, then they have certainly capped off an amazing career with an excellent comeback that I never thought they had in them.<br />I like every single song on this album and can't really pick a favorite. There is a complete range of styles from melodic ballads to heavy powerhits that are all equally top-notch in their own ways. There's not a bad song on this album, but depending on what mood I'm in at the time, I might prefer one or more songs over the others (temporarily). I don't see how they can ever top this album, but I can still hope... <br />Lyrically and acoustically one of the best albums of all time. Only Blind Guardian and Iced Earth can compete, and then only because depending on which mood I'm in at the time I prefer different things.<br />I don't really care to write song-by-song reviews (but I do enjoy reading other peoples' reviews of them!) so I will just say this:<br />The thought-provoking, lyrically sweet songs. Most have slow, driving tempos that hint of what's to come (the heavy, highly-singable choruses):<BR>*Ghost of the Navigator<BR>*Brave New World<BR>*Blood Brothers<BR>*Dream of Mirrors<BR>*The Thin Line Between Love and Hate<br />The driving, heavy, non-stop metal songs that you can't help but turn up really loud!:<BR>*The Wicker Man<BR>*The Mercenary<BR>*The Fallen Angel<BR>*The Nomad<BR>*Out of the Silent Planet
0316666343|3.0|Like many people who picked up this book, I did so to see what the hype was about. Not only has it been a bestseller, but it received outstanding reviews when it was first published. I think the praise it has received is only somewhat deserved. Ms. Sebold certainly deserves enormous credit for creating a story that seems, in the world of contemporary American writing, original and daring. And she took on an extremely difficult subject, on top of that--it's not easy to write convincingly about loss and grief as it is, let alone from the viewpoint of a 14 year-old. But Sebold gives us a narrator in Susie Salmon who is convincing and memorable, and paints equally impressive portraits of the Salmon family, devastated by the young Susie's loss. The writing, toward the beginning, comes across as simple, straight to the point, tight, and this is exactly the way to render a portrait of grief without delving into the traps of sentimental lyricism or philosophical musings on death and human nature. The first half of the book is very good at avoiding those traps; the second half is not. I found myself cringing more and more as the book progressed, finding more moments that felt a little too much like Oprah \\"remember your spirit\\" moments than I would like in a good novel. They occur when Susie makes annoying observations about the dead--that their souls are like snowflakes, that they are the air we breathe, etc.--and when the narrative hits the reader over the head with the notion of \\"letting go.\\" These examples and more struck me as a simplistic way to deal with the subject matter. They seek to comfort us, but true comfort would come with understanding; Ms. Sebold should have stuck with her exploration of the situation at hand instead of trying to make us feel comfortable about that situation. The turn toward the supernatural at the end, which is fine for a story that's supposedly narrated from beyond the grave, managed to feel unconvincing, a device that allows for yet another tender moment (the novel is filled with them, not all of them work) and not much more. The appearance of all the major players (save the murderer) in the same room at the end is another cliched and unconvincing way to wrap things up all too neatly. My one hope for a higher level of complexity, as I flipped through the last couple pages, was for the murderer to get away--which would at least be realistic, as many murders go unsolved and some murderers do get away--but even here Sebold takes an easy way out, allowing Susie to give in to a harmful impulse for which there are seemingly no consequences--strange given everything that the book has been about. Still, the story is structured ingeniously, and again the characters and situation are certainly memorable, even, in many places, powerful. But it would be interesting to see what Ms. Sebold comes up with when she challenges herself more with her narrative and doesn't rely so heavily on the easy way out.
B0001ZMWQO|5.0|I saw a review in the local paper and went to give a listen. I was taken then and there. Before I had gotten the CD the paper published a review by a small group of high school kids and it ranged from B+ to an F. I thought hey what did I hear that they didn't. The CD has arrived and I have listened to it nearly every day and don't get tired of it. It pounds out the sound and you'll want to turn it way up. You can't be down and listen to this. Yeah, there is a change up on a couple of the tracks that take you back to a Beatle track but it quickly changes and is not enough to make me cringe in any way. I love this CD and there is no way to be disappointed.
B0000DJZ8R|5.0|After a four year stint in jail for a self-defense murder, Tom Joad (Herny Fonda) returns home to find his family being ousted from their home.  The Joad's have decided to venture to California based on a flyer that promises a job for good pay in order to find a better way of life.  On the trip the family faces countless hardships, which seems to continue as they arrive in the the promise land of California.  Tom witnesses how his family and many others are being taken advantage of and how people are being considered &quot;good-for-nothing people&quot;.  Despite these adversities the Joads keep on struggling and hoping for something better to turn up.  Grapes of Wrath is based on John Steinbeck's novel with the same name which sends a powerful socioeconomic message about poverty, social injustice, and freedom where the dollar seems to guide all.  It also conveys a strong notion of hope, family, and determination, which can be the source of a better life.  The story's messages are equally important today as they were in 1940, and Ford does a brilliant job in depicting these issues on the silver screen.  Grapes of Wrath is an exceptional film that leaves the audience with a brilliant cinematic experience that will resound throughout the viewers lives as they will face these issues repeatedly.

B000002UA5|5.0|The Amazon.com synopsis of \\"Ummagumma\\" is a little off, factwise; the part-live/part-studio \\"Ummagumma\\" was not the sole vision of bassist and, later, lead songwriter Roger Waters. It was in fact a group idea, sparked by the suggestion of keyboardist Richard Wright. With the studio album, each member was given half a vinyl side with which to experiment (key word), a move which some called self-indulgent, but it was no more self-indulgent than much of the Beatles' work (especially their films).<br />The live half of \\"Ummagumma\\" would be Pink Floyd's only official live release for nearly 20 years before 1988's \\"Delicate Sound of Thunder.\\" The four selections are the ultimate document of Pink Floyd's psychedelic era, when they enjoyed playing live at smaller venues, as opposed to the arenas and stadiums of their post-\\"Dark Side of the Moon\\" days. Tracks that were already infinitely psychedelic in their studio parts are sent even further into space; 'Astronomy Domine' features an extended keyboard (or is it a mellotron?) solo, that brings a bit of beauty to an often spooky track, like the grim instrumental descent into insanity 'Careful With That Axe Eugene.' 'Set the Controls For the Heart of the Sun' epitomized Pink Floyd's sound of the era, and the ominous 'A Saucerful of Secrets,' a conceptual instrumental about war, soars much higher than its studio version; David Gilmour's wordless vocal cries are much more emotional and powerful than they were before (and stronger than the version on the \\"Pink Floyd At Pompeii\\" film).<br />A late-70s \\"Encyclopedia of Rock\\" claimed that these live versions sounded \\"too close to the album versions.\\" The writer obviously never listened to this album.<br />The material on the studio half is understandably difficult to enjoy if you're a new fan, or just not used to such unsual songs. But over time, one will find little pleasures in each one. Wright's operatic four-part instrumental 'Sysyphus' ranges from the dark and haunting to the serene and lovely. Roger Waters' 'Grantchester Meadows' is a surprisingly peaceful track from one of the gloomiest men in rock and roll, with a melancholy vocal reading, one of the most non-psychedelic of the Floyd's psychedelic era (the same can't be said about 'Several Species...' which is one of the most bizarre, erratic songs under Pink Floyd's belt). David Gilmour's winding, three-part 'The Narrow Way' shows his blossoming talent with both guitar and vocals, and never becomes boring. The final effort, 'The Grand Vizier's Garden Party,' is done by drummer Nick Mason and features opening and closing flutes, filled with engaging drum solos, with a melancholy tape effect at about the middle of Part 2; it's hard to tell exactly what makes that haunting sound, but it's nonetheless the highlight of the song.<br />Although most of the members of Pink Floyd share the same opinion that \\"Ummagumma\\" was a failure in artistic senses, they all seem to agree that its conceptual ideas--creating long, unbroken pieces of music that go through various themes--were the seeds for later triumphs such as the 'Echoes,' and various moods and ideas that wind through such albums as \\"Dark Side of the Moon\\" and \\"Wish You Were Here.\\"and lovely.

6305657947|4.0|I have been a huge fan of the original Thomas Crown Affair since I first saw it while in the military in 1969..... and bought this \\"re-make\\" because I heard so many good things about it.  I must say that honestly there are good points in BOTH films. I never quite bought the fact that the original Crown had McQueen's character robbing a bank.... so stealing the \\"Monet\\" made much more sense to me. I also thought the story was improved upon in the new version and I was more satisfied by the challenge Bronsnan's character found in Russo's bluntness. On the other hand, the sumptuous music score by Michel LeGrand in the early film was superior to the weak, lackluster and frangmented score that Bill Conti created for the new one. I also think I preferred the sensuous and sexy elegance of the fire between McQueen and Dunaway to the overtly sweaty lust that Brosnan and Russo desparately share. HOWEVER.... I must say I did enjoy BOTH films and find each beautiful and entertaining in their own ways.  <br />(...) The ART of the earlier version is a unique and compelling one and makes that film so fascinating to watch in widescreen!
B0001Z53AQ|5.0|This CD is an excellent one. In my opinion, it isn't quite as good as Devil's Night, but for me to give this CD 5 stars must be saying something good. Nevertheless, this is a very impressive follow-up to Devil's Night. So I'll give you the rundown on the tracks.<BR>1. Git Up - The opening track is pure adrenaline. Eminem begins what is to be a promising album, with Swifty and Kuniva bringing exciting rhymes to the song. 5/5<BR>2. Loyalty - A damn good song. Obie Trice guest appears on this track, but D12 members Swift and Proof do it for me. This is an excellent track. 4/5<BR>3. Just Like U - It's all Bizarre for this one. I didn't really take an interest in this one when I first heard it, but after a few more listens, D12's resident freak had me enjoying this a bit more. 4/5<BR>4. I'll Be Damned - This track's a damn good one. The chorus is hella catchy and is funny in places. Great track. 5/5<BR>5. Dude (Skit) - Funny as hell skit that leads into My Band. They should have this instead of the less-than-funnier intro for the actual video. Hilarious! 5/5<BR>6. My Band - Yeah, everyone's heard this song, but it's still a great track. Never seems to lose it's charm. 5/5<BR>7. U R The One - A love song from D12?! I never thought it'd be possible, but this works alright. Not D12, but not bad. 4/5<BR>8. 6 In The Morning - I love this song. The chorus is great, and the verses are terrific, especially Kon Artis' rap is excellent, accompanying some pretty spooky music. 5/5<BR>9. How Come - Another favourite, the lyrics are very deep, and the music is very memorable. A great track that encompasses the excellent skills of Eminem, Proof and Kon Artis. A dark song, but one that will be remembered. 5/5<BR>10. Leave Dat Boy Alone - Sounds like a Western song... but I like it. Very cool song, with excellent lyrics, especially Swifty's... Very chilling... 5/5<BR>11. Get My Gun - Now this is a song!! One part crazy rap, one part violent rap, and one part comedy rap. All killer! 5/5<BR>12. Bizarre (Skit) - Pretty funny, for a skit. 4/5<BR>13. Bitch - Now this is one hell of a funny song!! Eminem speaks gibberish, Kuniva and Kon Artis show their impeccable lyrical timing and humour create one hilarious verse and the chorus? Well, what can I say? It's crude, sure, but it's frickin' funny too! 5/5<BR>14. Steve's Coffee House (Skit) - Steve King, the recording engineer for the tracks on the album shows us his musical side. Unfortunately, it's pretty crap. Nonetheless, it's funny! 4/5<br />15. D12 World - Pretty good song. Not as great as the others, but alright. Kinda reminds me of \\"That's How...\\" from Devil's Night. 4/5<BR>16. 40 Oz. - A good song, although I don't listen to it too often. Still, it's a likeable one. 4/5<BR>17. Commercial Break - First we had Obie Trice, now we introduce Young Zee, and he delivers some tight, if pretty bland, beats. 4/5<BR>18. American Psycho II - A worthy sequel to the first song, with B-Real from Cypress Hill in the chorus. An eerie song, and one that'll keep you awake at night in fear... or not. 4/5<BR>19. Bugz 97 - This is an earlier rhyme from former D12 member Bugz (R.I.P.). It's a pretty good rhyme actually, and he will be remebered. 4/5<BR>20. Good Die Young - The tribute to Bugz. A heartfelt song, but it's just so good, lyrical-wise. Respect to Bugz. The best song on the album. 5/5<BR>21. Keep Talkin' - The final song, and they finish with a bang. Violent, and gritty, but good. 5/5<br />So all in all, this is an excellent album. I recommend you buy it immediately!
B00001OH1S|3.0|I borrowed this CD from the library because I was so disappointed in the Bill Conti music, but liked some of the other artists heard briefly in the film. The CD is much better than as a soundtrack because the most of the loud and distracting Conti music is cut back here. Sting is the highlight on the CD.... he is a genuine talent and seems to get better and more sophisticated with time. As strictly a CD it is a good compilation.
B0001NBMBC|3.0|this is a good Cd, but its too much like stonesour more then slipknot, lots of slow songs including a few acoustics....wasnt heavy like the other 2 at all, but still good, a totally different slipknot, i wanted more from there last CD though
0792840461|5.0|This is an extremely fine film. Besides a ingenious story and terrific acting by McQueen (who plays a \\"cool\\" and very wealthy businessman perfectly) and Dunaway (who looks absolutely stunning and plays it \\"smart\\" in nearly every scene), this movie has some fascinating and utterly BRILLIANT editing like no other film I know of... and a HAUNTING and GORGEOUS music score created by Michel LeGrand. <br />What about the NEW version?<br />I have been a huge fan of the original Thomas Crown Affair since I first saw it while in the military in 1969..... and bought the 1999 \\"re-make\\" because I heard so many good things about it.

I also thought the story was a bit more interesting in the new version and I was more satisfied by the challenge Bronsnan's character found in Russo's bluntness.<br />Overall, however this 1969 \\"Crown\\" is the version I prefer. It contains an absolutely beautiful music score by Michel LeGrand (which is superior to the loud, lackluster and frangmented score that Bill Conti created for the new version). The title track here is \\"Windmills of Your Mind\\" is an awesome song, but also amazing is \\"Her Eyes, His Eyes\\" created for the infamous chess playing sequence.  I also prefer the sensuous and sexy elegance of the fire between McQueen and Dunaway to the overtly sweaty lust that Brosnan and Russo desparately share together... this film is more subtile and suggests sexuality.. which seems more fascinating than just the plain nakedness in the new version.<br />Although I do prefer this film to the remake, both versions are well made and interesting in their own right, and should be enjoyed for what they are and what makes them so entertaining.
B00008PX8P|4.0|I would rate it a 5 but there are some rather poor clips.  Some of these I think I have heard quite a few years ago when &quot;underground&quot; music was big.  Aside from that this 2 DVD set is just great.  Audio mix is clean and clear and the acoustic set is simply worth the money.   I think the Stairway solo on The Song Remains The Same is far better than on this one but it shows that they improvise on stage, it is not like playing the record and they go through the motions on stage.   <BR>One thing I noticed on  some dvd's is they take clips from other concerts and edit them in.  I don't like that.  You hear the guitar for example and the video clip shows something else being played on the guitar (I play and notice this stuff - sorry - just bugs me.)<BR>I was hoping to see Led Zep live in Montreal prior to the drummer passing on so this is a close to the real thing as it will get, for me anyway.<BR>Just great!
B00000K501|5.0|I was trying hard to decided between dvd or video but since the dvd  didnt have Buck Dich, and I really wanted that one I choose video. The performance totally was worth losing all the extra interviews because its really awesome. This video is great, and I dont really like concert footage that much but trust me you'll love it. The sound is good and the band is totally hot with thier make up and costumes. If you like Rammstein, this is one to own!
B0000E1ALR|4.0|This is a good album.  For curious listeners who are new to The Boss, or those who have listened to his music over the years but never got to add him to their musical library, this is a defnitive collection for you.  For die-hard fans like myself, you will enjoy the digital remastering; those old songs do sound better.  Everyone will enjoy the bonus disc, which for me had one surprise, the song Lift Me Up.  Bruce sounds unbelievable using that falsetto voice for the whole duration of the song.  I gave it four stars because some of my favorites are not on there, like &quot;Further On Up the Road&quot;, &quot;Leap of Faith&quot;, &quot;Growing Up&quot;, &quot;Tougher Than the Rest&quot;, &quot;Point Blank&quot;, and many songs from &quot;Born in the USA&quot;...and that's just to mention a few.  Then again, it's impossible to please everyone.  Get this album; you will not be disappointed.
0553573403|5.0|This is an excellent book series that I have started rereading since the fourth book &quot;A Feast of Crows&quot; is to be published soon.  Martin is truly a wonderful author with amazing characters and an interesting plot.  Though some people may be turned away by the recommendation from Robert Jordan (because they are sick of waiting for him to end his Wheel of Time Series), these books are better than Jordan and there is a firm limit on the number of books; six.<br />The writing style is very good in that it lets you view multiple characters perspectives on the same major events.  You will come to loathe some characters and love others.  The emotions that Martin evokes are exactly what you would hope for in a great fantasy series.<br />Other points of note are these: magic does not seem to be a sort of &quot;deus ex machina&quot; as it is in other fantasty novels.<br />The characters whose perspectives you share are both good and bad; as opposed to being extremely one-sided.<br />Martin is unafraid of killing whatever characters he feels should die.  Although certain characters stand out, there does not seem to be a superhero (at least not yet).<br />These books are a fantastic read and a great addition to any fantasty reader's library
0440238609|5.0|There are so many fassets to this book that will ensure that it will be as famous in 200 years as Dickens is today.<BR>The story is artfully weaved and entwined so that it is always growing bigger and more encompasing, while retaining the sense of tension and magnitude from the begginning to the end.<BR>The characters are full of life and colour so much so that you feel you know them intimately from only a few pages of their story.<BR>I could not put down any of the books and since have read them many times, absolutley incredeible, even magical.  And far and away so much better than the comparitively dull and lifeless Harry Potter!
0385510438|2.0|If you read the description on the back cover, you will get the idea that this is a taut thriller about a convicted murderer seeking revenge on those that put him away.  Doesn't that sound exciting?  Actually, it is anything but.  This is John Grisham's ode to life in a small southern town and his regret for what such towns have lost.  While the trial-related story starts off promisingly enough, the trial ends about a third of the way into the book, but the story just lumbers on without direction.  Through the eyes of his narrator, a young newspaper editor, Grisham takes the soapbox on issues such as desegregation and a not very veiled attack on Wal-Mart and its effect on small town America, revealing his liberal leanings.  The novel should more appropriately have been called &quot;Dinners with Miss Callie&quot; since much of the the book centers around his relationship with a middle-aged black woman from the &quot;wrong side of the tracks.&quot;  Pages and pages are dedicated simply to descriptions of the southern dishes she prepares.  If this is your cup of tea, then by all means, pick up a copy of the Last Juror.  But don't be fooled by the marketing campaign.
B000069AUI|5.0|I have heard many lighter rock bands, but coldplay is definetly the best. They have the perfect combination of drama and ballads. They are a beautiful mixture between Aerosmith and North of OK. Definetly a band to check out.
B00005JKC3|3.0|I'll have to start with a disclaimer: I could care less about graphic novels and I really really really hate megabudget movies that permeate our theatres.  <br />Maybe that's why I was able to enjoy this movie.  Because whatever it is supposed to be isn't contrary to any expectations I had going in.  In fact, I was taking my younger brother to the movie, expecting to spend 2 hours yawning and anxiously waiting to leave.  <br />Yet for some reason, I sat down to this movie and really enjoyed myself.  The special effects were not very realistic, and the sets weren't either, but i think that was the point.  This is based on a comic book.  I think Ang Lee has succeeded in taking a graphic novel and all the artistic possibilities and made a movie that can be enjoyed if watched with a light heart and a sense of adventure.  The so-called &quot;slow&quot; parts are what made this movie interesting to me.  I thought that finding about Bruce Banner's life was pretty interesting, and then we got to see him turn green and run away from government machines.  <br />What more could you ask for in a movie?
B000005J56|5.0|I saw the video on PBS a couple of years ago.  I was instantly hooked.  I don't speak Spanish but like other reviewers have said, music is a universal language, and the beauty of this music proves that.  I highly recommend this cd as a must own.
B00006ALGL|5.0|This is just the best Album I have bought, ever! I found this little jem just before xmas 03 and haven't stopped listening to it since. Today for example I've played the album twice,and that was all the way through without skipping a track. Scared of over playing it and getting sick of it??? No! There is too much talent and emotion in it just to be played and forgotten<br />            There is a good and bad side to this Album, the good being that none of the songs apart from Cannonball get played on radio (BBC radio 2) The bad thing is none of the songs really get played on radio, so anyone I know who has heard of Damien Rice has found him through word of mouth, yeah me! <br />          Damien blows them all out of the water for his song writing. The musician ship is just way out there, and Lisa Hannigan's voice is just beautiful. When I listen to cold water and her her sing I melt, I haven't really listened to the lyrics to here what they are saying on this song, I just haven't gotten past her voice yet, thats the thing with this album there's layer upon layer of music, lyrics, and emotion.
0553296981|4.0|An insightful look back in history. &quot;Anne Frank, The Diary of a Young Girl&quot; is an almost fitting memorial to the young Jewish teenager who died at Bergen-Belson. Born in 1929 just before Anne Franks birthday she received a blank diary to write in. These entries are jaw dropping. This book is for everyone. It is a chance for people to read what the Holocaust was actually like, and the pain and injustice that occurred, and still occurs in the world today. It gives people a look on what type of horror is still going on in different parts of the world right now, and is more of an eye opener then anything. This book delivers a message, one we can all relate to. That ordinary people just like us are suffering. And for what reason? These people are not criminals. They are good people, smart people, and friendy people.
1592400876|4.0|This is a great book (and a quick read!) that will appeal to several kinds of people: <BR>- those who are sticklers for punctuation <BR>- those who missed out on learning about punctuation in school<BR>- and those who don't understand why some people care so much about punctuation.  <br />The book presents many basic rules of punctuation in a fun way. It's a good book for people interested in learning or reviewing punctuation marks: apostrophes, commas, semicolons, colons, exclamation marks, question marks, quotations marks, and dashes.<br />Don't skip the last chapter. It's an insightful discussion of the future of punctuation and the impacts of email and text messaging on traditional punctuation, grammar, and spelling rules. Truss makes a good case for not abandoning traditional punctuation conventions, while still being open to changes caused by technology and social norms.   <br />As an English teacher, I would have liked to have seen a little more coverage of  basic grammatical concepts to help readers understand the \\"why\\" of punctuation. However, by keeping her focus on punctuation, Truss makes the book a quick, entertaining and insightful read.  <br />As a little bonus, because the author is British, the book also makes the reader aware of the differences between British and American punctuation conventions. U.S. readers, in particular, may be surprised to know that the conventions they learned in school regarding whether to put the puncutation inside or outside of quotation marks are different in British English. There are many other subtle differences as well, which are great for anyone to know in this global economy. <br />So overall, take the time to read this book. You may not agree with every bit of it, but it will make you think, and you'll definitely learn something!
B0001GL3K4|1.0|Umm, this isn't love; this is lust and infatuation. None of these people know each other well enough to have a true love between them. True love takes getting to know who a person really is not falling in love with some fantasy of what we think the person might be or what we want them to be. Get real!<br />The thing about this kinda \\"love\\" is it always falls apart, actually.
B00006RCNW|5.0|I rented the first four episodes of this series because of the hype I had heard about it. After viewing the first four episodes I went out and bought the entire first season and watched the rest in one sitting. This show really is that good! I really don't watch that much TV and the little I do watch isn't one hour dramas but I do watch and like the Sopranos. Ever since I watched The Shield though the Sopranos seems dull to me. The Shield has charecters that grow as the series moves on and they are deep and rich in personality. Every episode has action and will keep you at the edge of your seat, just waiting to see what happens next.<br />I HIGHLY recommend this series to anyone who likes action/drama and I have yet to meet anyone who has seen this show and does not love it.
B000002KYK|5.0|I dont know about anyone else but I have listened to both versions of the Blade Runner soundtrack.... and love them both. My favorite is this one though. &quot;Memories of green&quot; on this CD evokes an emotional response that Vangelis' CD never could. If you are a Blade Runner fan and love classical music, then this will surely please you.
B00005JLEU|5.0|The first time i saw this, I wasn't sure what to think. I didn't know if I liked it or if I thought it was weird or what. After a bit i realized, this movie is one of the most brialliant things I've ever seen. That's how good it was; I didn't quite know how to comprehend its effect on me. It is know my favorite movie. The story and animation captures you and takes you to a distant world. It is a must see and must own DVD. I just loved it and recommend it to everybody. Along with this movie I recommend Millennium Actress.
B0000683DH|5.0|\\"Star Trek\\" has legions of fans, spawned numerous television incarnations, and inspired ten feature length movies.  It even is responsible for adding the word `trekker' (which, obviously, refers to fans of Star Trek) to the official English language, courtesy of the Oxford English Dictionary.  It is not hyperbole to say that \\"Star Trek\\" is a true cultural phenomenon that has reached into many corners of society.  The second full-length feature film \\"Star Trek II: The Wrath of Khan\\" may be more responsible than any other production (television or film) for the series' widespread popularity.  To call it only a science-fiction movie would not do it justice.  After a dull predecessor that tried to hard to be like \\"2001\\" and appealed only to die-hard Trek fans, \\"...Wrath of Khan\\" reintroduced fans, new and old, to the great space opera that is Star Trek.  What enabled to transcend its genre and reach mainstream audiences was that it contained elements that spoke to most movie goers.  It is a tale of revenge in the same vein as \\"Moby Dick\\"; a tale of dealing with growing old and trying to recapture youth; it is part \\"Star Wars\\" and part \\"Run Silent, Run Deep\\"; and, most of all, it is a tale of supreme sacrifice.  All of those elements combined to make this the most successful \\"Star Trek\\" movie to date (both critically and at the box office) and enables the power of this film to resonate more than 20 years after it first premiered.  <BR><BR>After suffering the effects of a stiff story and sluggish fan reception for \\"Star Trek: The Motion Picture\\", producer Harve Bennett went back though all the old episodes of the original series to search for a storyline that would be most worthy of a sequel.  An episode called \\"Space Seed\\" which introduced audiences to the genetically enhanced super villain, Khan Noonian Singh, or more simply `KHAN!' (as Captain Kirk so eloquently put it in this film).  That choice produced one of the finest science fiction films to grace the silver screen.  In addition, the producers also did away with the clinical sets and pastel uniforms in favor of a cozier Enterprise bridge and uniforms more befitting a space navy.   <BR><BR>Khan (played with delicious melodrama by Ricardo Montalban) was a character that would have special reason to seek revenge against Captain (now Admiral) Kirk (William Shatner) and the crew of the Enterprise.  After defeated by Kirk at the end of the \\"Space Seed\\" episode, Khan and his cadre of genetic super humans were exiled to a planet that soon became an ecological wasteland, killing much of the crew (including Khan's wife).  Fast forward 15 years and Khan is presented with a golden opportunity to exact revenge when an ill-fated scientific mission by the USS Reliant stumbles upon his planet in an attempt to find a lifeless planet to test the Genesis Project, a new experiment that can produce life from lifelessness.  Khan manages to capture the investigative team (which happened to be the ship's Captain and its first officer, Chekov, from the original series) and use mind controlling parasites to take command of the Reliant.  Once in possession of his own starship and free from exile, Khan begins his quest to exact revenge upon Kirk while also seeking to possess the dangerous power of Genesis.<BR><BR>\\"The Wrath of Khan\\" provides some of the most gripping moments of drama this genre has to offer.  The twists and crests in action are frequent, natural, and spectacular.  It's fascinating to watch the horror Kirk's face when he realizes that the man behind the surprise attack on the Enterprise is Khan.  When Kirk, and the damaged enterprise, abruptly turn the tables on Khan as he prepares to finish them off, a rush of adrenaline courses through the veins of all who are watching.  The cat and mouse battle in the Mutara Nebula reminds many of the submarine warfare from \\"Run Silent, Run Deep\\".  Then, there is the tragic sacrifice at the very end.  All of this made this film such a spectacular mainstream success in 1982 and continues to give it amazing strength today.  <BR><BR>The Special Edition Director's Cut restores a few scenes that have been absent from most of the past video versions, most notably two scenes that show what the connection is between Scotty and the young midshipman who dies during Khan's first attack.  In addition, the special features disc provides insightful interviews with cast members that shows the creative process and inspiration that brought \\"The Wrath of Khan\\" to existence.
B000002L9J|3.0|I'm not a huge fan of The Smiths. They do okay, I suppose. Intrumentally they seem fairly accomplished. Morrissey's a decent singer, even if he is a bit arrogant and whiny. Smiths fans...you KNOW he is! I guess it's part of the Smiths charm or something. Anyway I have a few of their albums and it's shocking to me that most fans consider this one the best. Why is \\"I Know It's Over\\" almost 6 minutes long, with the last two minutes nothing but nauseating out-of-tune repetitive Morrissey whining? Also \\"Some Girls Are Bigger Than Others\\" is a mediocre way to close such an \\"amazing landmark 80's pop album\\", as it were. Plus, on the whole, many of these song don't do much for me. Sure, most of them are decent, I suppose, but I don't think any of them are among the very best Smiths songs, except maybe the gorgeous \\"There Is a Light That Never Goes Out\\". Good ones like \\"Bigmouth Strikes Again\\" and \\"Frankly Mr. Shankly\\" are really well-written catchy and fun too, but Morrissey's dry sense of humor and endless sarcasm gets kinda old to be honest. There's just not very much room for sincerity there. I'd recommend Strangeways, Here We Come as the best Smiths album. Louder Than Bombs is good too, including some of their best stuff, though that album is a little patchy. But as I said, I'm not a huge fan, so at least you know this is not as biased as many of the 5 star Smiths-obsessed reviews you'll find.
0316666343|5.0|Having read both &quot;The Lovely Bones&quot; and &quot;Lucky&quot;, I am enthralled with Alice Sebold's ability to weave an enchanting story about such difficult topics as murder and rape.  &quot;The Lovely Bones&quot; is a fast, entertaining read that hooked me from the very first sentence.  I highly recommend this book, and would suggest that the reader become acquainted with Sebold's memoir as well (&quot;Lucky&quot;), which tells much more about why Sebold chooses to write about such difficult issues.  &quot;The Lovely Bones&quot; may seem to end too perfectly to some people, I was left feeling like all of the wrongs that had been committed were in some way righted.  Characters like these deserve to have a happy ending, and Sebold did not fail to deliver what seemed to be the fairest ending possible.
B000069KGM|5.0|There are, as showed in the reviews for this album, many different people with many different opinions for this album. For example, I admit Chicago (Transit Authority) were more comercial than many other Jazz/Blues/Rock n' roll bands. However this is where peoples opinions are divided over Chicago's greatness. Some find it sickening that Chicago are considered one of the best Jazzy bands, over bands of whom were far more Jazz based, however others realise that they were titled as a Jazz/Blues etc band because their style was unique and fitted into no other catagories and so were named Jazzy.<BR> Those of you who don't like Chicago, that's fine, perfectly exceptable as music is all about pesonel opinions, likes dislikes etc. Everyone is entitled to their own opinions don't you know?<BR> Now, to talk about the music. <BR> Chicago Transit Authority is a great first album for Chicago, displaying everything that would make them great over the forth coming decade. All the songs are superb and all have their individual moments of perfection. The great thing about a band like Chicago is you can feel the emeotion in the music. This is at no point more prominent than in the Trumpet/trombone solo's on Beginnings about four minutes in. It is worth buying the album just for that moment, it is truly beautiful.<BR> In a rather rushed conclusion, If you already have some Chicago, even if it is a latter Chicago 20+, you will love their first album and it is worth every penny. If you have never bought a Chicago album before, you may as well start here as it is just as great as its successors. Superb!
1592220053|5.0|I picked this book up on a whim, I have always been a fan of the movie Silent Running and thought this had a similar premise (turns out it doesn't really, but that's ok).<br />First off I have to say that the book is a little oddly constructed. I am tired of the one line author bios (\\"Lives in Maine with his wife and four cats...\\") but in the end papers of Tuf Voyaging we get Mr. Martin's CV for goodness sake. The man has a lot to be proud of, but really, come on. Let's keep the ego in check a little.<br />Besides, the book speaks for itself. I understand it is \\"cobbled\\" together from stories published previously, but for myself, coming in unawares, the chapters work just fine. The opening chapter deals with how Tuf gets an amazing space ship, a bio-engineering \\"ark\\" (in one of the less subtle moments the ship is named, um, The Ark). Then we get introduced to an over populated planet in need of help (and desiring The Ark). Then a few more chapters, cleverly showing how Tuf uses the Ark in unexpected ways to both help people and satisfy his sense of morals.<br />The books works because a) it is endlessly inventive, always  the hallmark of good science fiction, and b) clever in execution. Each chapter lays out an interesting problem which Tuf then proceeds to, in his own droll way, solve. Not always the way people expect or want him too, but in a way which is interesting nonetheless. <br />I do have to agree the novel ends some what poorly. Martin boxes himself into a corner and then offers a fairly mediocre (if not logical) way out, but the rest of the book more than makes up for it. <br />Hey, it's a fun read, it makes you think (and imagine) and yet does not dumb things down or present silly ideas just for shock or novelty value. Highly recommended.
B00008NG5V|5.0|In &quot;On and On&quot; Jack Johnson continues to defend his claim to his seat in the arena of Dave Mathews.  Phenominal CD altogether.  It felt as if he stepped out of the studo ideology for this CD producing songs that were just as long as each of them needed to be without trying to find the catchy chourus or beat that radio top 10 programmers drool over.  Perfectly unspoiled.  Every song allows you to close your eyes and propel yourself to a sunny beach in Maui. Provided he continues to produce this quality of music he is on his way to being immortalized in the very same way that DMB is for many.  Surfing, Cinemotography, and music were his carrer options.  There is no doubt in my mind that he made the right decision.  Buy either one of his CD's (or both) and you'll agree.
B00003CXCT|3.0|My friends laughed at me 10 years ago when I bought a Laserdisc player.  And, yeah, I hardly ever use it now that I have DVD's.  However, George Lucas released the trilogy AS IS on Laserdisc.  No new effects, only remastered for digital.  One of my projects is to transfer the Laserdiscs to DVD.  I want to watch the \\"analogue\\" version, not the \\"digital\\" versions Lucas wants us to see.
B000089RVR|1.0|There are reasons behind my disliking of Dido. I've only heard her radio hits, I wouldn't aspire to the whole album, but presumably they are the best songs. It's not like I've heard one song and ripped her off, I have actually listened to at least ten of her songs, about 100 times each, due to drastic overplaying. <br />Firstly she doesn't really have a voice. Lets just step back for a minute, and listen to some Aretha Franklin or Chaka Khan. Now they have voices. Dido talks, in a dull, dreary tone that never ceases. Someone needs to tell her she can actually change the note instead of this lazy droning.<br />Secondly, the lyrics are very depressing. And I mean VERY depressing. Her videos are dull and depressing. She makes Nirvana seem cute. But why? Why is this millionaire pop singer making lyrics about surrendering, going down with the ship, waving the white flag? She might aswell do death metal. Her next album could be on the theme of cutting your wrists, or capping yourself with a shotgun and not making a mess, or at least something mellow for all the little 12 year olds. <br />In a nutshell, she is grey. She sounds grey. She looks grey. Her music is grey. If you like this greyness your name must be Norman. If not, do yourself a favour and get rid of Dido's suicidal dribble.
0920668372|1.0|This book chronicles a woman cradling and chanting a poem to her \\"baby\\" as he grows from an infant to an adult. \\"I love you for always, I love you forever, as long as I'm living my baby you'll be...\\" or something like that.  It ends with the man cradling his dying mother, chanting the same poem.  This is the only book I've ever actually thrown in the trash, because I didn't want it read to my son.  I want him to thrive for just a little while in the wonderful, happy world of childhood where there is no death, no guilt, no forcing of love.  Give it to your graduating high school senior, if you like.  Read it for yourself to make yourself cry.  But PLEASE don't read to your toddler... I think it's filled with underlying love-guilt messages that are manipulative and confusing for a toddler.
B0001US8EO|4.0|If the film Tombstone was a cheeseburger and fries, then Wyatt Earp is a nice thick ribeye.  After an inexplicably long wait however, Wyatt Earp arrives on DVD in only a decent package at best.  The picture's new digital transfer and the remastered 5.1 soundtrack are terrific.  Two nice documentaries (albeit brief) are added as well as the trailer and the extra scenes from the expanded edition.<br />What are disappointments are the fact that the extra scenes were not incorporated in the film here (only accessable as an extra feature), no commentary from ANYONE, no animated menus, no biogrophies or filmogrophies.  You can't really call this a special edition, especially after you compare this with Tombstone's double disc pack.<br />The cast (especially Dennis Quaid) is what makes this film great.  Costner, who traditionally doesn't hold up strong playing legends certainly made one tough gunslinger and a VERY believable Wyatt Earp.  With that moustache, hat, and cold stare, he sure was intimidating!  While Tomstone's cast looked like actors playing cowboys, Wyatt Earp aims for realism and hits its mark dead on.<br />If you're a fan of this film, then this DVD is definitely worth getting.  However, if you only collect DVDs with a lot of extra glitz, this will be a bit of a letdown.
B00004BZ0N|5.0|What can I say here that hasn't been said already???  Even the pompus magazine Rolling Stone had the smarts to call this album the #1 album of the 80's  (being it came out in late Dec of 1979).<br />What a fantastic album this is of, ska, punk, reggae, rock songs.  And LOOK HOW MANY THERE ARE!  19!!!  Who has put out a collection of that many AWESEOME songs for release since???  I can't think of a SINGLE artist since then that has come anywhere close to doing that..<br />This album just isn't for new found rebelious young kids, it isn't just for aging late 30 40 somethings who relsihed the time, it isn't just for anyone who loves to dance (this album will MAKE YOU MOVE!!), it isn't just for earthy reggae folks, it isn't just for unabashed blue-collar protestors who want to rebel, this album is litteraly UNIVERSAL, everyone can get enjoyment from it.<br />I have to tell you one of the hardest decisions I had to do was when I was making a recording long ago with some other songs, I tried to have all the songs from this album, but I had to get rid of one of them...  I couldn't do it, it was seriously one of the hardest musical decisions omissions I could think of.  I was struggling to think if there was even one song on this album that was half ass, mediocore, or just okay that I could omit.  There isn't they're all gems!!<br />Love this album, it will never age, and will always be better after each listen.<br />If you don't own this album you really need to get it if you love music.
B0000DZEA1|5.0|This is the oscar winning soundtrack to the oscar winning movie....and did I mention that one of the song won an oscar.  Outside of that, the songs really capture the magic that the books give off.  The songs are haunting and up-lifting in parts.  The orchastra does an amazing job in performing the music.  Overall, this is a great albumn, you can even meditate to it and if you clear your mind just enough, Middle Earth comes to life in your mind.....
B0001DMPVI|5.0|Until you've heard it, you will never know.  This was Eric Burdon's answer to the Beatles Sgt Peppers LHCB.  This is a master work that will never be repeated in any form or function, contained herein, the greatest compilation of music from the 60's I've ever heard.  &quot;In the beginning...  Well, you should know by now.&quot;   We love you, Eric.
B00008EY65|4.0|I'm extremely excited about this set!  I saw this twice in theaters and really enjoyed the story as well as the bad guy, Kroenen.  A great cast and great characters.  I can't wait to see all the cool extras they have planned, especially the storyboard to screen comparisons that are real time side by side with the film.  NICE!!!  Hope to see some bloopers too, but don't know if that's going to happen.<br />This is going to be a great DVD!<br />Bring on Hellboy 2!
B00003CXCT|5.0|Like many (many) people I still remember the original 3 movies, I've seen them back to back many times, on tv, on video, in original, extended etc. They are still the defining movies for the 70's/80's, they are more influential than the Matrix (which I loved), and more beloved than The GodFather. When they came out there was no competition to their status, but times move on. <br />Now, it's interesting that people keep on mentioning some masterpiece not being changed by some artist after completion. Someone once asked Picasso if he ever finished a painting, and he replied \\"they are never finished\\" (or something to that effect). Artist don't 'not change pieces' because they are satisfied; that the piece is already 'perfect', they don't do it becasue they can't! They might not own it, they can't be bothered, they're too busy doing somethingelse, they might be even happy with the way it is; however, it's unlikely to be perfect. As someone who paints (amongst other things) I know understand this, a piece is rarely complete or (even close to) perfect. <br />However, some artists do change/revise a released product later, this is obviously not always the case and composers throughout the ages have decided to make changes to certain pieces for better or for worst; anyone who's studied perfomance practice will know the difficulty in finding the definitive version of a piece.<br />At the end of the day, it's Lucus' dream, his concept and they are his masterpieces. Now I don't believe these movies need to be changed, but if he does, its his perogative. I'd still thank him all the same, and I can't wait to own these.
B00005OWEG|3.0|This newfangled and longer version of APOCALYPSE NOW, hyped up by the director and the press, raised a lot of expectations but is a less satisfying experience than the original version. <br />TONS of footage was shot for this film.....there is a 5 and a half hour version on the bootleg market that features even more footage than REDUX, all of it interesting, but none of it important to the film. <br />The accomplishment of the original APOCALYPSE was narrowing down this plethora of footage into a tight, straightforward, 2 hour and 20 minute narrative that I consider one of the best films ever made. <br />REDUX, however, ruins the narrative flow of the film by re-inserting scenes that distract from the plotline and change the mood of the film with negative results. <br />Especially awful is the much-celebrated \\"French Plantation\\" scene, which stops the movie dead in its tracks for 20 minutes so a French colonist can rant at his dinner table about politics and Martin Sheen can smoke opium and have sex with a French widow. Coppola thought this scene was terrible when he shot it (check out the documentary \\"Hearts Of Darkness\\") and rightly dropped it from the film, so why the hell is it back in?<br />It's especially annoying to have this once-classic movie padded out with pointless scenes when there are quite a few deleted scenes involving Dennis Hopper, Scott Glenn, and Brando that are more relevant to the plot but weren't reinserted. <br />Overall, REDUX smells of a money deal.....Coppola trying to restart his currently flatlined career by revamping and re-releasing his old classic work.<br />If you're a fan of the original APOCALYPSE, then REDUX is worth a rental to check out the new scenes....but I strongly recommend any newcomers to watch the original APOCALYPSE first before checking out this inferior version.
0553801546|3.0|Like a Cheetah, she started off strong, then crapped out in the end. I AM a fan of R. Hobbs' writing, and I expected more out of her than what she gave. I received the distinct impression that towards the end she was struggling to tie everything into a neat package, perhaps as a warning that this really is the end of &quot;The Tawny Man&quot; trilogy; possibly at the urging of her publisher to meet a deadline. I felt that she didn't &quot;do justice&quot; to the complex and unique relationship she created between Fitz and the Fool. It was like being served fine Russian caviar on a Cheez-it. Life is full of mundane events and relationships, why serve us more of the same?<BR>If you've already invested time and money into the first two books of this trilogy, by all means please finish! I would say that it's better to follow through than not to. Don't expect to be disappointed, but don't be suprised if you are.
6305609705|5.0|It's hard to catagorize APOCALYPSE NOW. It's about war, but isn't a war film.....it's more about the darkness of the human soul and man's inability to overcome the terrors of the world without going insane. <br />This isn't a hyper-realistic vision of the Vietnam War, but in its drugged, insane, dryly humorous worldview of a conflict with little meaning and its impact on the souls and minds of a boat crew escorting a military assassin to dispatch a Army Colonel who has gone psychopathic and has formed his own army of Asian primitives to wreak mindless bloodshed, the film transcends the war setting and becomes a journey into the absurd. It may not be how the Vietnam War actually WAS, but certainly may be how it felt to some who were involved.<br />Some of the most powerful images in cinema are displayed in this film. Witness the drugged, drunken, and disturbing opening scene of Willard, the army assassin, having a nervous breakdown in his hotel room.......or the helicopter attack on a Viet Cong village, which is stunning in its scope and ferocity.....or the final haunting shot of the film, with the words &quot;the horror....the horror&quot; whispered as a final denounement. <br />A must-have for any film collection. The only drawback: for the DVD version of this film, director of photography Vittoro Storaro has chosen to crop the original 2:35 Panavision framing down to about 2:1, cutting a fair amount of picture off the sides of the frame. Thankfully, this isn't noticeable most of the time, but a handful of shots in the movie are ruined by the loss of picture information. <br />And avoid the longer, reconstructed REDUX version until you've seen this original masterpiece. REDUX has some interesting new scenes, but they add nothing to the narrative and have a negative effect on the pacing of the film.....the original APOCALYPSE is a masterpiece, and REDUX is just a interesting alternate version that is frequently boring and doesn't have the same impact as the original.

B00014K5TQ|4.0|&quot;Party Monster&quot; has a unique history behind that production.  The film is an interesting account of Michael Alig's life seen from his friend, but the most intriguing part of the film is that it features Macaulay Culkin after 9 years absence from the screen.  <br />The film's directors Fenton Bailey and Randy Barbato once made a documentary film &quot;Party Monster: The Shockmentary&quot; in 1999, which is based on the murder of Angel Merendez, also one of the aquaintances of Alig.  Now, the same team give a fictional account of the same case, helped by the book &quot;Disco Bloodbath&quot; by James St. James, who was, besides Alig, one of the faces seen in the &quot;club kids&quot; vogue in New York City in the 1990s.  This newer &quot;Party Monster&quot; features talented Seth Green (in drag) as James, who recounts the days of the party, drug, and the eventual downfall of Michael Alig.  And you know, Alig is played by Culkin.<br />OK, but don't try to find out the &quot;truths&quot; of the murder.  The film is more about the relations between James and Alig, or how Alig met James, and is taken under his wings to gain the short-lived celebrity status.  The film, using flashbacks, follows the crazy days of party, drug, and eventual downfall of the man.<br />What is most attractive is the acting of Seth Green.  His face might be associated with &quot;Austin Powers,&quot; but actually he is a good actor, or far better than you miight think.  See how he plays the role of flamboyant James with a slight touch of humor and irony.  Remember, his debut was back in 1982 in &quot;Hotel New Hampshire,&quot; and he's been doing this job more than 20 years. <br />As to Macaulay Culkin, it is true that he is less effective, but still good.  Perhaps we have seen one too many &quot;Home Alone&quot; film.  The supports include Chole Sevigny, Natasha Lyonne, Dylan McDermott, and Marilyn Manson.  But their roles are not big, and I am afraid Ms. Lyonne is unrecognizable to some.    <br />The story is not the strength of the film.  You cannot find the answer to the question -- question, I mean, about how come the vogue, though briefly, took over the media to become the talk of the people.  After all, it is about the bubble-like  movement, and the film is not trying to rationalize that fact.  <br />Still, the film is interesting to see if, like me, you didn't experience the trend as first-hand knowledge, especially the 'anything goes' style these characters show in their  desperate attempt to reach fame, and be fun.  We know it will end in emptiness, or the film, not to be judgemental, presents  all about the emptiness of their behavior as it is.

B000001IPP|5.0|I listened to this album night and day back in 1995. I remember, it was on sale for 5 bucks. It was new but already on sale, I said &quot;what the hell, It's only 5 bucks&quot;. That was one of my greatest investments. I can still listen to this album and just love it. You feel those guitars and drumbeats all over. If you love Punk, or are just a music lover that can appreciate this album, buy it. If you also get a chance to see them live, check them out. They are great live and just a cool bunch of down to earth guys. I'm sure many people out there already love Rancid, but there are many who still don't dare listen. Lets help them out. This is Rancid in their prime.
B00012QM8G|5.0|Unlike the glossy schoolboy fantasies from outer space that make up a bulk of Spielberg's roster, Schindler's List is a work of unsensational realism, resonating with clever observation from start to finish.<br />When I read the film's decription, I thought it'd be a collection of scenes about the Holocaust. And I thought, big deal. But the movie has some very vivid, poignant moments. There are enough characters, enough motivations, enough idiosyncrasies to make the screenplay rich enough to keep us always involved. Yet, the director does not shy from the humanity of the bad guys and the shortcomings of the good ones.<br />Ben Kingsley makes for a fabulous fidgety character, ever so worried but in a palpable outwardly manner. Liam Neeson as the pivot is very convincing. But the cake I feel goes to Ralph Fiennes who mastered the European accent of English to such perfection that I almost scorned him as a true soldier of the war. His casual demeanor while shooting a couple of workers in the camps from his balcony was a sight to behold.<br />BUT the most stunning thing about this movie, as it unfolds, is the pang of conscience in a simple man that made all the difference in the lives of so many. The gruesome scenes of the lives lost in the dastardly &quot;war&quot; is etched in my memory, and the number of people Schindler saved was impressive, but the thing I remember having being touched MOST by is how such an imperfect man found himself doing something so perfect.<br />All in all, despite the undeservedly featureless DVD that Universal has slapped this movie on, it must be a prominent part of every movie collection!
B0001A79JO|5.0|I love this album. I had to listen a couple times, but then it just hit me. I would consider this mostly Psychobilly but there are of course many influences involved. Artists always talk about there influences and it always seems to be some sort of classic rock or Punk band. But, Horrorpops aren't afraid to say they love New Wave too. DM and Souxsie must be in their CD library.<BR>Patricia's voice reminds me of Souxsie on a few songs, but that's my opinion. <BR>Overall, this is great album if you are truely looking for something different and fun to listen too. 'Julia' is probably my least favorite song, but everything else is Excellent.'Where they Wander' and 'Emotional Abuse' rule! Do yourself a favor and buy it now. If you can, check them out live too. They might not be around for too long before they return to their original bands.
B0001HLVSC|5.0|I approached this movie assuming I would enjoy simply because Russell Crowe is the title star of the film, but the film is much better than I anticipated.  As Captain Jack Aubrey, Crowe plays the Commanding officer of the British vessel the HMS Surprise.  Severely damaged by a new and more militarily advanced French warship, Aubrey must choose whether to abandon his mission and repair his ship, or do the best he can and seek revenge.  As expected, Crowe's performance was excellent.  He plays the role of an early 19th century naval Captain extremely well.  A second standout performance was delivered by Paul Bettany who played the ship's doctor;  He was definitely the character I sympathized with the most and Bettany should be lauded for his performace.<br />The strength of this movie resides in it's intense realism.  From the setting, to the manner in which life onboard a 19th century vessel is portrayed, to the carnage and gruesomeness of the battles, this film did a remarkable job of recreating an authentic atmosphere to make the viewer believe he or she is actually watching 19th century naval history.  There is one scene near the beginning of the film which shows a young child having his arm amputated after an encounter with the French.  One can only imagine that what is depicted on the screen was as bad if not worse in real life.  This film is truly an enjoyable viewing experience and one any history enthusiast or fan of dramatic adventure films should see.
B000001IQH|3.0|This is by far my least favorite Rancid album. It has some really good songs but a whole lot of bad ones that belong on pop radio. I'm sure many 12 year old punkers and posers loved this one. However, Rancid still remains a great band. They are true to music and are of great influence to many. Without Tim, there would be no Hellcat. Without Hellcat, there'd be no Distillers or Horrorpops in our Cd players or on the radio. If you are just getting into Rancid, this is a great album, Enjoy. But when your ready, try 'Let's Go'. Now that's a great Rancid album.
B00008J4P5|4.0|I found a number of five star performances on this album; my kids (5 and 7) love &quot;Black Math&quot; and &quot;Hypnotize.&quot; There are a few cuts not quite as strong, but not necessarily weak--just not mindblowing. What I really wanted to mention was the depth of historicity in this album: the Whites have embedded some really heavy and complex geneaological stuff in a number of cuts. First example: &quot;Black Math&quot; references the Count Five's &quot;Psychotic Reaction&quot; both lyrically (&quot;react&quot; in the first line, plus the fact that the words are rather psychotic themselves)and musically. Where &quot;Reaction&quot; is slow, though, &quot;Black Math&quot; is fast--the important thing is that there's a bridge in each song that changes tempo, followed by a concluding verse.<br />&quot;I Want to Be the Boy&quot; has been characterized as resembling Yellow Brick Road-era Elton John, but actually it's Rod Stewart incarnate, circa 1972. Vocals are similar, as is the arrangement, but the really bizarre aspect is that &quot;Maggie M&quot; seemed to reference a woman somewhat older than the narrator, and &quot;Boy&quot; seems confused about just whom he's trying to impress.<br />Finally, how could anyone hear &quot;Hypnotize&quot; and not think of &quot;Secret Agent Man&quot;?<br />Apart from being a great spin, this album is wonderful because it offers an opportunity for seriously geeky discussions bordering on the academic; perfectly good material for the record shop employees in &quot;High Fidelity&quot; to trace roots. Someone with a lot of time on their hands could probably chart the themes for each song and each song referenced, then connect the dots. Don't know if the thread holding it together would be ironic, respectful, or both.
0553293397|4.0|The Naked Sun is a great sequel to Asimov's Caves of Steel. There, we were introduced to Elijah and Daneel as well as the Earth in the 3rd millenium, with its industrialisation, soullessness, pathological confinement in enclosed spaces and a dictatorial intrusion of the bureaucratic machine into every aspect of life imaginable. <br />In this book, a murder occurs in a Spacer world and Elijah is specifically requested for. The murder, they say, is a logical imposibility, as it could only have been done by one person and even that person could not possibly have done it. Reluctantly, Elijah travels to the world of Solaria, where the murder occured and, reunited with Daneel, attempts to solve it in his already well-known style.<br />Considering the contempt of Spaces for all earthlings, his visit to the outer world of Solaria is unprecedented and he has no idea to expect from a culture which diverged from earth's 300 years ago. The result is staggering - a huge planet with only 20,000 inhabitants and several thousand robots per person means unprecedented luxury. Everyone has huge estates, isolated from everyone and life is automated and mechanised to the nth degree. This reflects in the social aspect of life, where *seeing* a person (in the flesh) has become a social taboo, to be avoided as much as humanly possible. Instead, social contact is done through the impersonal, though extremely sophisticated machinery and is called *viewing*. Even a husband and wife (allocated roles in Solaria) rarely see each other, most of the contact done by viewing.<br />And so, without giving away the details of the mystery, Bailey is essentially faced with a thematic connundrum. On the one hand, the Solarians don't have the almost psychotic fear of open spaces and nature that Bailey and other earthlings possess due to existing all their lives in boxes within boxes. But Solarians have lost the other essential aspect of humanity, as Bailey sees what a pathetically isolated, lolly-pop worldSolaria is, where most of what we consider meaningful (real interactions, children, family) are either taboo or nonexistent.<br />The book represents a step up from the Caves of Steel which outlined the way people live on earth. For the first time, we can see Asimov's robot-filled universe and the consequences on technology. On Earth, the crowding has ensured that social contact has remained but people have lost their communion with nature and the universe itself. On Solaria, the reverse is true, with plenty of sun and open spaces but no humanity. I really enjoyed this whole take on the world (especially as Bailey learns to see his fear of open spaces for what it is - an arbitrary, unnecessary hinderance). <br />The only problem is that Asimov hammers this thematic point with the subtlety of a Britney Spears outfit. Still, it's interesting. The mystery itself is what has been criticised in otehr reviews and I don't consider it as satisfactory/&quot;perfect&quot; as Caves of Steel, but it's relatively interesting and it just shows that the action was a vehicle towards what Asimov really wanted to say.<br />So, overall, a great book despite its flaws as it'll actually make you think about the values of our society and the direction we *might* be going - unlike many other sci-fi works (including some by Asimov), this one's both entertaining *and* meaningful.
B00005JLR8|3.0|I was keenly disappointed by this film, director Jim Sheridan's highly praised semi-autobiographical memoir of his family's emigration from Ireland to New York City in the early 1980s, when the city's grimy decay was still at a peak.  There are moving moments, but overall, the film felt mechanistic and poorly realized, and the acting was only so-so.  I was charmed by Emma Bolger, the little girl who played his youngest daughter, and to a lesser extent by her sister, Sarah Bolger, who was a little on the precious side.  The adult actors were uniformly unimpressive -- Samantha Morton's character never really takes shape or emerges emotionally; male lead Paddy Considine has some interesting qualities, but consistently overacts his parts, and African actor Djimon Hounsou intones portentiously, in a rather bland and too-easy manner.  I just didn't feel like I was seeing much subtlety onscreen, and while the film has some appeal, it never really moved me.  Maybe that's only because I'm such a heartless bastard.  Or maybe it's because the film wasn't really that well made.
0316776963|5.0|I have taken my sweet time getting to the end of this book.  And now I am rewarded for my efforts.  Sedaris's 'Dress your family...' is about to arrive on June 1st.  HIP HIP HOORAY!!!!  <br />'Me talk pretty...' is so WONDERFULLY REFRESHING.  I have taken a lot of time to get through it because I just don't want it to end.<br />But NOW I can finish it and enjoy a new Sedaris book in just a few days.<br />'Naked' was my first introduction to Sedaris and I found myself laughing even harder with 'Me talk pretty one day'.  He depicts his life adventures (trully that is what they are) with such dry humor that you will indeed find yourself laughing in public, if you chose to venture outdoors with his books.  The reader should be warned!  <br />I LOVE DAVID SEDARIS!!!  BUY HIS BOOKS, NOW.  <BR>(Except for 'Barrel Fever', not as funny.)
B0001CNRB6|3.0|Oh. My. Gawd.  I mean, for years and years and years, we've all heard the feminist critiques of how Doris Day was an example of the retrograde sexism of her times -- the Eisenhower era and the early, pre-feminist Sixties, blah blah blah -- but in movie after movie, I've seen her portray a capable, cheerfully assertive participant in the battle of the sexes -- no doormat here!  The Doris Day-as-antifeminist icon thing seemed like a bum rap to me.  This film, however, is the first one of the classic Doris Day-Rock Hudson bouts I've seen in which Day is, pure and simple, a victim and a sap.  Hudson co-stars as a rival advertising executive, who uses tacky boy's club tactics to steal Doris's clients out from under her.  Rock takes a guy out drinking, provides a few call girls and --zingo!!-- he lands the MagnaSoap contract.  Doris stammers and clenches her fists, struggles to give him a piece of her mind, while he in turn jeers at her, calls her frigid, and flaunts his sexual mastery at all possible junctures... Of course, their first battle is fought, as in \\"Party Line,\\" over the phone, so she hasn't had a chance yet to see what a hunk he is.  In Round Two, Doris assertively hauls him in front of the review board of the chamber of commerce, a decisive act that boomerangs when, with a nudge and a wink, Rock makes a fool out of her in front of the all-male panel and walks away unscathed.  From that moment on, he's got Doris under his thumb, besting her at every turn, and, finally, gets her so drunk that she beds him, winds up pregnant and is forced to marry him and live, um, happily ever after.<br />The script is peppered with the most aggressively sexist dialogue of any of their films -- it's as though, after having set the formula and worked through it in several previous films, the Hudson-Day producers felt they had to one-up themselves and make it more extreme, punchier, harder.  The humor has an underlying mean-spiritedness and misogyny, a lack of balance that's exemplified by the Hudson character's near-complete lack of growth.  You assume, early on, that during his seduction of this hapless female, that he will unwittingly fall in love with her and become a better person, but througout the course of the film, the only moderation in his behavior comes at the very end, when he realizes he would rather stay married to her than not.  Nonetheless, he's never actually contrite or abashed, Hudson's still pretty much a jerk when the curtain closes and it's up to Day to recognize that her physical attraction to him trumps their past history.  Plus, she's all knocked up: what's a good girl to do?  As a result, the film isn't as enjoyable or as pleasant and frothy as other Doris Day films, in fact, I found it a bit jarring, although the glimpse back at old-school male chauvinism can be pretty instructive.<br />On a more entertaining note, this has some of the most delectable and blatant homoerotic/demi-gay undertones of any of Hudson's films.  The scene in which Hudson cradles Tony Randall's head in his hand (to help swab some dye off his face) is charged with erotic power; in the next scene, we find that Randall has spent the night at Rock's apartment, and not long after that, Hudson announces that he's giving up New York and is going to move to San Francisco(!)  It's all semi-coincidental, of course, but pretty rife with campy thrills, given the later disclosures about Hudson's private life.  In sum, this film is super-retro and Neanderthal, not as much fun as early versions of the same material, but it does have considerable camp value, if that sort of irony-laden anti-notalgia is your kinda thing.xemplified by the Hudson character's near-complete lack of growth.

B00005UOXN|4.0|I buyed this album because i loved the greatest hits. I buyed it without any expectations and i wasn't disappointed. It' a bunch of remixes made during end of the 80's. Songs have more swing than the original (commercial tinted?).
B0001HAISG|5.0|I tend to stay away from cheese-filled words like &quot;magical&quot;, &quot;whimsical&quot;, &quot;captivating&quot;, &quot;exquisite&quot;, etc. <br />In the case of &quot;Peter Pan&quot;, I really can say nothing but the above. The movie was breath-taking and I wouldn't change a thing about it. I loved it and recommend it highly for children and adults, alike. <br />Everyone who knows the story of Peter Pan was probably first introduced to it - visually - by Walt Disney and the amazing animated rendition. I feel that P.J. Hogan really did an excellent job at presenting the well-known tale in a new light. Many things in the story were presented the same but it was the manner and the light in which they were revealed that really fashioned the stunning images.
0066620996|5.0|Unwavering resolve to do what must be done! Ah -- a characteristic of the Level 5 (Good to Great) leader, described in this well researched book that shows the reader what it takes to take a good company to greatness.  Personal humility fortified with professional will gives Good to Great leaders the edge on their ego-driven counterparts.  Collins makes many marvellous points, the first being that the RIGHT people are your most important asset.  By rising above unrealistic optimism, confronting brutal facts and asking questions that lead to the greatest insights (optimal thinking), the leader moves his company to greatness.  Good to Great leaders focus on the few things that have the greatest impact (optimal thinking).  Collins won me when he said &quot;One of the primary ways to de-motivate people is to ignore the brutal facts of reality.&quot; Good to Great leaders create a culture where the truth is heard, and where negative thinking is not degraded or scorned (optimal thinking). This book is a must read!
B00008QSA5|5.0|If you like the real Blues rhythm, if you like hearing great musicians playing it, and if you love music, then there is no doubt! This is the album you have to own!<BR>Al KOOPER, Stephen STILLS and Michael BLOOMFILED made an outstandin' job in just two days of recordings. They used every great element there is in Blues music, which can be found in BB King's  music and in other blues legends.<BR>This is a five star album, five-star music, five-star producing, five-star work and five-star musicians.
B00003CXCT|5.0|All three original Star Wars movies are all classics special edition or not. And on the debate between the originals or the special editions. I am, personally, against the special editions. One reviewer has mentioned that the movies are George Lucas' works and that the fans have no right to criticize what he's done with them. I disagree, however. Because Star Wars is so close to so many people's hearts they are, in a way, the fan's movies. I have always said, don't fix what's not broken. Lucas has tried, and that's fine, because being only 16 the first time I saw Star Wars was the special edition in the theaters, but the true crime is trying to keep the original versions virtually unobtainable unless you want an aging dilapitaded copy on VHS. <br />Anyway, Lucas, if your changing of originals was a way to get more money, trust me, you'd get a lot more money if you would just release the originals on DVD. Everyone that doesn't buy the special editions would buy those.
B00005UKE0|5.0|The first solo album by the one who when asked: &quot;How does it feel to be a beatle?&quot; replied: &quot;I don't know how it feels not to be one&quot;. <BR>George Harrison, was always a mystic person and we can hear how it influenced his music, for example, through the Sitar.<BR>In this album we can hear that George was also very religious, songs as &quot;Hear Me Lord&quot;, &quot;My Sweet Lord&quot; and &quot;Awaiting On You All&quot; are all catchy rapid tunes.<BR>The song &quot;All Things Must Pass&quot;, was also recorded in studio by the Beatles (see Anthology 3), but was denied from every album.<BR>While the Beatles were falling apart George have worked on these great songs and this great album which was released exactly the same year in which the Beatles seperated.<BR>The re-released edition features perfomances by Eric Clapton, George's great friend.<BR>In conclusion, this is a wonderful and warmly-recommended album.
B0000TLA9G|4.0|I like, bought this album on its release date, first thing in the morning, expecting the best album to ever hit shelves. When I looked at the back, I was kind of dissapointed. Where was Estranged? Where was One In A Million? A lot of the band's best are not on here. The track listing shoulda ran more like this:<br />Sweet Child O Mine<BR>Welcome To The Jungle<BR>Mr Brownstone<BR>One In A Million<BR>Patience<BR>Live And Let Die<BR>Dust N Bones<BR>November Rain<BR>Estranged<BR>Knockin On Heaven's Door<BR>Civil War<br />Aint It Fun<br />So ya can see there are some great songs missin'. Of course I gave this 4 stars cause still are great songs, but as I said, There are some missing.
B0000AQVCL|2.0|This CD will get old real fast. I do not recommend buying it for the following five reasons: 1.It's unoriginal. 2.The songs are lame. 3.It sounds like AC/DC filler. 4.It's cheese 5.It's boring. I will say that the singer has a strong set of pipes and that the singles are pretty catchy. But the ballads are real cheese and the lyrics are good to poke fun at. If you're looking for a good &quot;classic&quot; rock sounding band, go back to the 70's and get the real thing. They might be entertaining to see live.
B0000X2EOW|4.0|I admit, the story may not be the best story in the world. I have to say that David Bowie's clothing (which has come under attack in other reviews) isn't that surprising for the time. Welcome to the 80s. Every rocker's crotch was on display. I remember being horrified by seeing the Rolling Stones in lycra.<br />But Labyrinth is a classic movie, the second work by Brian Froud and Jim Henson. Brian Froud's fantastic artistic work resulted in amazing muppets and puppets done by Jim Henson's studio. The story itself is based upon the concept of changelings, that the Goblin King could steal away a child. The older sister has to go on a quest to take back her wish to be rid of her little brother. The fantastic sets, and fantastical creatures within the Labyrinth are both worth buying this set. The additions on the dvd of images and galleries, and the film cell are a must for collectors of either Henson's work or Froud's.
B00018TI5E|4.0|As with JF's other solo work, the songwriting on &quot;Shadows Collide With People&quot; is incredible. Almost every track could qualify as a favorite. However, as with his other work, the production takes some getting used to. It's definitely not polished studio work. I'm not complaining -- I like the rawness of it all. However, RHCP fans who've never heard John's solo stuff should be prepared for grainy recordings, odd (almost amateurish) layering of samples and synths, overused reverb and delay, and simplistic drum machine beats. A positive way to describe the production quality is experimental -- almost like John is sitting in his bedroom with an eight-track recorder, some cheap mics, and too many electronic gadgets to fool around with (which probably isn't far off). But you gotta love the fact that the emotion behind the songs, as well as Frusciante's trademark guitarwork, still makes this an incredibly enjoyable album.<br />That said, my two favorite JF albums are not even his official releases. For a long time, he had about 20 tracks free for download on his Web site, which were just incredible -- in my opinion better overall than &quot;To Record Only Water.&quot; I don't know if they are still on the site, but if they are, get them. Also, my absolute JF favorite is the acoustic version of &quot;Shadows,&quot; also available free for download at John's site. These are the same songs as the studio album, stripped down to nothing more than John's vocals and his acoustic guitar. No electronics, no effects, no production whatsoever. Flaws and all. And you know what -- it's friggin' awesome.
B0001V07ZQ|4.0|There is no knowing what great theme Peter Weir is going to take it into his head to make a film about next. It is a long way from \\"The Cars that ate Paris\\" to \\"Master and Commander\\" - or maybe not. Like most Australians, who have to travel to the far side of the world themselves if they want to get home, Weir is probably fascinated with isolation, with the journeys undertaken into the unknown by people like Captain Cook, and with the complex little communities that existed on crowded ships where men lived and died side-by-side under a strict authoritarian hierachy. In this film, this strange hierachy is underscored by the plucky little midshipman, upperclass to his bones, bawling at seamen four times his age.<BR>Having read some of the Jack Aubrey books, this film is a great distillation of them. The Stephen Maturin character is probably the better for being portrayed as a humanist rather than as a vaguely paranoid Irishman with a complicated background. The opening scene is one not to be missed, with the creeping tension broken by crashing salvos of cannon fire. It leaves you well pleased not to have been involved. <BR>There is no bang crash ending to the film in contrast to what most of us may be used to; rather it proceeds as a series of vignettes, knitted together by their pursuit of a French privateer. Even when you think it is all over, it is apparent that time rolls on, ships sail on and their job is still not over. It sticks in the mind, for all that and is well worth the popcorn.
B0001ZMWQO|5.0|If, say, you're sitting around playing cards or trivial pursuit or Russian roulette, slightly buzzed, with this album on in the background, and you don't start doing the subliminal-beat finger tap, toe tap, head nod, or torso sway, then your cold, cold heart must pump ice water through your diseased spider veins.    And if you actually give this album a dedicated listen, and don't find a single riff or melody memorably catchy and fun, then your mind is a wasteland of forgotten references and partially remembered indie newspaper reviews shot through with a reptilian, limbic-brain impulse to affect a studied cool that has about as much soul as a pair of saline implants.    This album won't change your life, make you think really deep thoughts, or give anyone a reason to wear torn T-shirts or black lipstick.  It's just fun, catchy, upbeat rock n' roll that you'll enjoy for at least one summer as you hang out, drive around, and do whatever it is that you do.  For some, this is apparently not enough.  But if you understand that sometimes this is exactly what you need and nothing more, buy the album and you won't be disappointed.    For you lemmings who came in here to squeeze out a one-star review while dropping a name or two to show the \\"wisdom\\" that stands behind your \\"taste,\\" go back to reorganizing the labeled jars of your leavings by volume and texture, or whatever you do when you're not pissing on something to prove that yours is bigger.  Bah!!
B0001W8Q9Y|5.0|Waa Waa, marillion doesn't write Fugazi anymore.  Holy crap I'm tired of hearing people that want the same CD time after time.<BR>Marillion has undergone a metamorphisis that went off track with Radiation (I still can't get into that one).  .COM took a little while to grow (some of it still is a bit thin to me), and ANARAKNAPHOBIA was a coming of age for a band that wanted to write great tunes, but did not feel it had to regurgitate past glories.  Anarak has grown on me, and I love it.  MARBLES was a complete surprise to me.  (By the way, if you are writing a review, it's not necessary to state you have the DELUXE version since the single CD version has yet to be released).  <br />MARBLES has combined the 2 directions they have gone in the last decade perfectly.  Three songs that top 10 minutes, at least 4 songs that would be on the American charts if it was not for the filthy, dreadful industry music has become(Amercian Idol anyone?). Some bizarre yet still catchy trax as well.  All with a nice flow, beautifully layered.  Cheers h, you sing the songs like you do because you love what you do.  <br />I couldn't be happier with MARBLES unless the UPS women who delivered it was topless and well stacked.  I will help pack whatever venue MARILLION play within 150 miles of my home.<BR>Thank you boys for something to sink my mind into.<BR>Well, WELL worth the wait.

B00003CXIP|5.0|When I first heard about this movie,I just knew from the start that it was going to be good,but I never thought it was going to be such a masterpiece from beginning to end.This is undoubtedly one of the greatest coming-of-age stories of all time,which really was meant to be a horror movie based on Stephen King's book \\"The Body\\".Here's a breakdown of the movie:<BR>1.Acting(5/5):The acting by these 4 kids is astonishing,and definitely the best part of the movie.River Phoenix,who died tragically a few years after making this movie,is the absolute best out of the 4,playing a troubled kid with a bad family and a bastard for a brother.Wil Wheaton is also one to mention,playing his dramatic scenes as if he was a veteran already!And Corey Feldman is in his only good role as pretty much a crazy kid with,as one guardkeeper said,\\"a loony for a ather.\\"And,last but not least,Jerry O'Connell is completely hilarious as the fat kid(Verno).<BR>Story(5/5):The story isn't really challenging or confusing,but that's the beauty of it.It's just 4 kids looking for a dead kid and disovering themselves along the way.Sure,it sounds stupid on paper,but you come to love it once you see the movie.And all the characters' background information is simply so realisitic and such an accurate portrayal of life,from a kid coming from a horrible family and being known as a criminal even when he is not one(Chris Chambers played by River Phoenix),to a kid who is completely ignored by his family because of his football star brother who dies(Gordo played by Wil Wheaton),even to a crazy kid with a psychopathic and abusive father(Teddy DuChamp played by Corey Feldman).<BR>Production(4/5):The production doesn't really stand out or anything,but the producers did a very good job making the movie look like it was set in a small town.<BR>Screenplay(5.5/5):Who can forget such unforgettable quotes such as:\\"TRAIN!\\",\\"LEECHES!\\",and \\"So I'll see you sometime(Gordy)\\";\\"Not If I See You First(River Phoenix)\\"?And the one topoint out is the story about Lardass(created by Gordy),also Verno is one to point,delivering each line hilariously,especially his trademark \\"Sincerely!\\"<br />The Verdict:This is truly a worthy coming-Of-Age classic and deserves to be part of any video or DVD collection(in this case,it's DVD!)<br />Recommended:Yes!
0425173755|4.0|&quot;Murder on the Orient Express&quot; is another old fashioned mystery, thoroughly without modern detective methods.  Though it is not as tense as &quot;And Then There Were None,&quot; it is still full of anticipation.  I did find it gratuitously wordy.  If you do not read too much into the story, then you'll solve the crime in no time.  The ending will make you wonder if it is justifiable (and then you'll remember this is a work of fiction).  A good read for a vacation - I recommend.
0553213105|5.0|This plot was definitely fit for me.  I am into the suspensful love stories that pull you into the story and won't let you go.  This book was like that for me.  I felt I could relate to a lot of it in that the girls were fighting over a guy or gossiping about who they think is prettier, or who they admire the most; something i could see my friends and I doing a lot.  I think a part of the book that portrays the similarity between my friends and the girls from &quot;Pride and Prejudice&quot; is when the Bennet and theLucas women get together the morning after a ball and discuss all of the details.  Mr. Bingley is the hot item in town and they are trying to decide who he likes the most.  &quot;Oh!---you must mean Jane, I suppose---because he danced with her twice.  To be sure that did seem as if he admired her--indeed I rather believe he did--I heard something about it---but I hardly know what---something about Mr. Robinson.&quot;<br />&quot;Perhaps you mean what I overheard between him and Mr. Robinson; did not I mention it to you? Mr. Robinson's asking him how he liked our Meryton assemblies....and which he thought the prettiest? And his answering immediately to the last question---Oh! the eldest Miss Bennet beyond a doubt, there cannot be two opinions on that point.&quot; (pg. 20).  I also love all of the characters in her novel.  For each one of them i could tink of someone I knew who was exactly like them.  I feel like I know Elizabeth, Jane, and Charlotte so well because they each have qualities almost identical to some of my friends.  My favorite character throughout this book had to be Elizabeth.  She is strong, witty, and extremely intelligent.  She has a lot of the qualities that inspire me to be a stronger person that stands up for my beliefs.  I love that she is able to battle with Darcy about what makes the &quot;perfect&quot; woman.  Her intelligence makes Darcy drool over her.  I think Elizabeth would be a good role model for a lot of girls who need tolearn what the meaning of independence is, and how to use it.  A quote in the book that shows Elizabeth's  strength.  &quot;My fingers, said Elizabeth, &quot;do not move over this instrument in the masterly manner which I see so many women's do.  They have not the same force or rapidity, and do not produce the same expression.  But then I have always supposed it to be my own fault--because I would not take the trouble of practicing.  It is not that I do not believe m fingers as capable as any other woman's of uperior execution.&quot;  &quot;Darcy smiled and said, &quot;you are perfectly right.&quot;&quot;<br />Another reason I love this book is because of Jane Austen's writing style.  She uses such a large vocabulary that thouroughly illustrated everyone's feelings so well, that it made it hard to put the book down.  Austen's wording just seemed so elegant and flowed together perfectly.  I felt smart just reading her book.  It was definitely challenging because of the old fashioned wording and advanced vocabulary, but it feels like such an accomplishment finishing such a great book.  I reccomend this book to anyone who wants to enjoy a great story and get a sense for the social status of women and men during the 19th century.  It's a great book, and I have nothing bad to say about it.
0446310786|4.0|&quot;It's a sin to kill a mockingbird.&quot;  These words were said by Atticus Finch to his children Jem and Scout.  The theme of the book was set around this quote.  I enjoyed this book because of the way it progresses.  Unlike alot of books, it follows the lives of the Finch family over a time period of two to three years.  It shows how everyone matures physically and emotionally.  The book is very descriptive, letting the reader picture the story as it is happening.  One of my favorite parts of the book is when Atticus Finch is in court defending a young black man accused of raping a white girl.  Many of the people in the community dislike Atticus for taking the case.  The one person who stuck by him through the whole case was his son Jem.  Jem was worried after his father had an incident with Mr. Ewall, the father of the girl who was raped.  In a conversation with his son, Atticus says, &quot;So, if spitting in my face and threatening me saved Mayella Ewall one extra beating, thats something I'll gladly take. He had to take it out on somebody and I rather it be me than that housefull of children out there.&quot; (pg. 211) This really showed that Atticus is not afraid to stand up for what he believes in.  He risks his family and reputation for one man.  The part that I thought was very significant, happened towards the end.  Scout said, &quot;Naw, Jem, I think there's just one kind of folks. Folks.&quot; (pg. 227) This shows that Scout is a better person than the rest of her community to stand up for what she thinks is right.  She thought that whites and blacks were equal.  She also showed good character for respecting her father for the man that he was, which was honest and hard working.  I really enjoyed this book and recommend it to all readers.
B0001XAPZ6|5.0|The bad reviews of this movie pertain to the cut up version of this brilliant film by Miyazaki. This version will be uncut at 116 minutes. This is the real deal that all otaku have been waiting for on Region 1 for an eternity. The deal with Disney was a perfect move for Miyazaki so his films get the treatment they deserve on DVD. If past films (Mononoke, Spirited Away & Kiki) are any indication as to the amount of attention Nausicaa will get, we should be in for a great DVD. August 31st can't come fast enough!
B0000DC13U|5.0|one plus one is phenomenal stuff at least for one reason, which is that one of the 'ones' mentioned in the title refers to the Rolling Stones' recording of Sympathy for the Devil.<BR>The experience is amazing. The viewer is taken into to the studio where Keith Richards literally composes the song, plays guitar, plays the bass, sings in the chorus and directs fellow backing vocalists (Charlie Watts, Bill Wyman, Marianne Faithfull). It is literally amazing to see how involved Keith was and how much he was leading the band.<BR>But Keith's leadership is only half of the story. One plus one also tracks how Mick Jagger come up with the lyrics that have made this song so famous. The movie also makes it quite clear how alienated (and marginalized) was Brian Jones from the rest of the band.<BR>The movie develops from the first chords (that Mick patiently shows to Brian Jones), to the session in which percussion where added, to those in which the piano was added, to those in which Keith plays bass, to those in which Keith improvizes few notes that would later become Sympathy-for-the-Devil-vintage-guitar-solo.<BR>It's a great historical document and the music is quite excellent. One plus one is definitely worth watching.
B000002IST|1.0|Where have you gone Steve Hackett and Peter Gabriel?  Phil Collins ruined Genesis.   How can they go from &quot;Nursery Cryme&quot; to this crap?
B0001611DI|5.0|THAT GUY, MOVIE GUY OF WHATEVER THE HECK HIS NAME IS, DOES NOT KNOW WHAT HE&quot;S TALKING ABOUT. FIRST OFF, THIS IS A DATED MOVIE, GET IT! DATED WHICH MEANS ITS A LITTLE OLD. AND IT IS SCARY. ITS ALOT SCARIER THAN NOWADAY HORROR FILMS! TRUST ME THIS ONE REALLY SCORES.
B00005JMEW|5.0|The best thing Tarentino has done yet. The characters are outrageous. The cast is splendid. The camera work is fantastic. The soundtrack is fabulous. The animation (yes, I said animation) is a wonderful surprise. Uma Thurman raises the bar for butt-kicking chicks. The whole thing is over the top, and it's movie making at it's best. I just saw Pt 2, and it is even better.
B00003OSTN|5.0|Here is the story of your average post-World War II housewife who believes that nothing is too good--or too much--for her two precious daughters.  By the time this great soap opera is over, she has buried one child, experienced the murder of a cheating, mooching sleazeball of a husband, sent the other daughter off to prison, and gone into bankruptcy.  But at least Eve Arden's character is good for a few laughs.  At the end, though, she seems to reconcile with her first husband, whom she kicked out of the house in the first reel for losing his job.  It's nice to know one can sometimes start out all over again.
B00005JM4Z|3.0|2 fast 2 furious was indeed good but not so good I mean The reason I went is to see the Nissan Skyline!!!Overal the street racing was cool just to much special effects.Lets get real vipers,corvette,s281 saleen stang cant catch 2 imports?@ imports beatinging up Powerhouse muscle.Dont get me wrong Im a huge import fan but the whole movie doesnt make sense its just loose you from the beginning like whats the whole point.Dont get me wrong the racing is cool but the plot is corny.
0792164903|5.0|Johnny Depp's is hilarious as the scared hero and the story is dark enough to pass as somewhat horror. Christina Ricci was excellent too, who happens to be way more brave the Depp's character. Very entertaining movie, dark humor worked really well
B00005R87Q|4.0|This is Better then number 2 by far!This actually concentrate about streeting racing then in part 2.They were actually true street racers in this film i mean how cool is that.This is explore the culture of street racing is all about how people come together and race.Cars were really nice and sweat and i mean SWEAT!Shows you how young teen people or young adults blow there money on there cars then on other stuff to make them stand out or faster then others.<br />The plot was really focusing on the main character Paul And Vin alot to show you who they really are and the others characters as well.Some of the movie had a bit amount of mistakes buts all good but this is one movie its all about how race your car not stand next to it.
0800177177|3.0|ugh, as everyone said what da hell does this have to do with Bram Stroker?  Anyway, I thought it was pretty entertaining. Gary Oldman was awesome.  I just didn't see Winona rider as Mina at all, kinda ruined my experience because of that (not to say that I don't like her in other movies, I just don't imagine her as mina) Mina was supposed to be a strong woman who is extremly supportive of her husband whose life she nurses back from certain death. In the movie not only she is a weakling, she is actually in love with Dracula? The use of Absinthe and the sexuality really took the movie away from the book, although I didn't mind it.    I would give the movie 4 stars if it wasn't for the fact that I read the book prior to watching it and felt that the story line was too tainted with.
B0001CNRS4|4.0|Honey was indeed a good movie i just dont know why they compare it to you got served.Its whole different ball game in both movie especially honey.Honey is jessica alba who wants to make a break through in the dancing world you can call it but it just distracted by work and everything around her.If you watch the movie good the movie display about true events what really goes on in todays worlds especially with kids and young adults with talents.Theres alot of people like honey with mad talent it just its hard for them to get know because either it the environment there living in or the are distracted with other things that prevents them for achieving there goals.I really like they focus on Jessica Alba and others people around here cus it goes to show you never give up because the thing you are looking for it right there in front of you.
B000066NW0|1.0|yeah, i heard her sing live on mtv last year. she sounded terrible. either she was really off that night or she really can't sing. personally, i think she's a fake.
B0000AQS0F|3.0|I should point out that my interest in science fiction, guns and blowing up stuff is limited.  If it is cleaver, if the dialogue is snappy, if the characters are well-drawn, then I can get into it. <br />I do like Buffy, and Angel, on occasion (particularly this final season) is reasonably good.  I figured that this series by the same creator might be very similar in mood. <br />The first episode, which took me two sittings before I could finish it (I fell asleep twice) was maybe 2 hours long.  I don't know.  It began with a battle scene, that made little sense to me, and then we actually get into the story, much of which also confused me. <br />Often for a series, with episode two, you often begin to see some potential, and with episode three, a good series can begin to hit some high notes.  Well, I haven't gotten to episode 3 yet.  Episode 2 was less boring than episode 1 (which I recommend you skip until later).  But still, this is just moderately-interesting people in space with guns shooting other people who also have guns.  I am assuming the genre's which are being mixed are sci fi and westerns. <br />If you are a sci fi fan, and you like star wars and star trek, then you'll probably like this.  If you like to watch various groups of people shooting guns at each other while flying in space ships or after they have gotten out of their space ships, then this could be the series you have dreamed of.  There is a plethora of gunplay, explosions and space ships.  For some people, you couldn't ask for anything more from a series.  There were all kinds of people who gave this series 5 stars.  If you are not specifically a sci fi fan, then be forewarned, this may not appeal to you. <br />If you are looking for something as cleaver and insightful as Buffy could be (at its best), I haven't found that yet.  If you are looking for a heated argument as to who would win in a fight, astronauts or cavemen, well, I haven't found that amusement level yet either.  I've only watched 2 episodes, and I don't know if I am going to watch a 3rd. So, maybe it picks up and gets better?  I may never know.
B0001ENY6M|5.0|This soundtrack is one of the best soundtracks that I have ever heard.  John Debney was an unknown composer to me before first hearing about &quot;The Passion of the Christ&quot;, and I have to say that his score for this film is equal to the integrity and beauty of many of my favorite scores, which include &quot;The Lord of the Rings&quot; trilogy, &quot;The Shawshanke Redemption&quot;...Just to name a few....This score did not immediately blow me away...But after seeing the film and having my devotion and perspective of my relationship with Christ changed, I am moved each and every time that I hear this music. How anyone can even compare it to Peter Gabriel's score is completely unfounded. I do agree that the style is similar, because of the use of Middle Eastern instruments, but that is where the comparison ends.  Gabriel's score uses the same melody over and over again and there is hardly any use of strings at all while each of the pieces on &quot;The Passion&quot; score are different and obviously mean more to the composer then just trying to be a breakthrough in scoring movies.  &quot;The Passion of the Christ&quot; soundtrack is amazing and I hope that it will be given the recognition that it deserves.
B0001ZMWQO|3.0|&quot;Take me out&quot; is a song equally brilliant as the hype around the band, but there is not another song that reaches the extas of the single &quot;take me out&quot; and let me tell you something, that's not a good thing... I would say that the bands first self titled album is a classic first album. The band has a couple of other good songs with a little New york dolls vibe over them, i'm talking about &quot;Michael&quot; and &quot;Jacueline&quot;. Half of the albums songs is good or at least promising for the future but i'll save my praising to the next album. And another thing being from sweden that i recognize is the swedish producers strong ifluences from swedish bands such as Atomic Swings -Stone me into the groove and the ark, the hives and so on. Anyway if you're at all interested in music i suggest that you check the ferdinands out, at least they'll blow you away with one song.
B0001WTUH6|3.0|I was very interested in the movie when it came out, but after seeing it, I wish they had gone into the story more.  Just when it was getting good, blam, it was over.<br />Also, IMHO, they made the vampires way too wimpy.  In one scene, Selen and another guy get into a car accident and he has to revive her...WTF?  Not what I would have expected for the \\"masters\\" of the Lycans.<br />The only vampire that kicked butt was the ancient one, all of the \\"modern\\" ones sucked.<br />I'm also PO'd of the practice of release, then re-release of DVD's.  As such, I've now adopted the practice of waiting several months before adding to my collection.  DON'T support this and keep buying both versions.<br /> (...)<br />For Underworld, make a stand and pass on this version if you already have it.
B000005JAX|5.0|The music on this album is dripping like warm honey into the ocean of love. What more can you say really? I've heard all the orginals and let me tell you Gore is not just overdubbing them but is actually remaking them into his own. For the unceartain future of depeche it's comforting to know that Martin as a solo artist always gonna be around because this kind of music just have to leave a mans soul and cant be botteled up. The album is a killer...
B00006LHYC|4.0|Italian superstar Laura Pausini starts her conquest of America by showing what she can give from the inside. <br />1.I NEED LOVE<BR>*A beautiful ballad, typical Laura.<br />2.DO I DARE<BR>*R'n'b/pop song.. Definetely not the best tracks of this album. Little boring. <br />3.SURRENDER<BR>*Up-tempo song shows that Laura can sing something else too but ballads. Not bad!<br />4.IF THAT'S LOVE<BR>*A positive surprise on this record. Something new and something old mixed up.. The song shows the power of her voice. Good lirycs.<br />5.IT'S NOT GOOD-BYE<BR>*An english version of &quot;In assenza di te&quot;. Beautiful ballad though it's not a brand new song. <br />6.LOVE COMES FROM THE INSIDE<BR>*A rock song from Laura. Something that the old fans haven't got to used to hear from her. The song is marked because of its unlikeness.<br />7.EVERY LITTLE THING YOU DO<BR>*Can be compared to Madonna's &quot;Frozen&quot;. Great lirycs though the chorus is repeated too many times. Nice pop song though.<br />8.EVERY DAY IS A MONDAY<BR>*Another english version of Laura's previous song &quot;Il mio sbaglio piú grande&quot;. Lirycs are totally different than in Italian and that cuts down the points of the song. I don't like them. But otherwise it's still very working song.  <br />9.YOU ARE<BR>*Another ballad. Beautiful lirycs don't save the song which is little bit boring and needless on the album.<br />10.I DO TO BE<BR>*A very nice up tempo song. The pop song takes you away with its rhytmh and sound. <br />11.WITHOUT YOU<BR>*A very sad ballad about the end of releationship. Laura's voice is very strong. This is best of Laura Pausini.<br />12.EVERY LITTLE THING YOU DO (piano/vocal reprise)<BR>*Quite nice ballad.. Peaceful. <br />13.SURRENDER (Toronto Chilled mix)<BR>*A great bonus.. Brings little bit of colour and difference to the record.
B000003TA2|5.0|i love this record. really, it's my favorite sonic album. they were so ahead of their time. and lucky me - i saw them about a week ago  in louisville. i was like three feet away from the band and in heaven. goo me, goo you.
038073186X|5.0|I usually figure out mysteries long before the novel ends, forgetting the whole story within six months.<br />I'll never forget Shutter Island where a physical map is not even half the layout of the land.  Dennis Lehane took me down a winding road to total amazement.  This will be the first book in the last fifty I have read that I will openly recommend to my friends -- the ones I want to keep!.<br />He combined literary depth of character with intricate plotting in a matrix of total deception.<br />If I would change anything it would be to trim the dialogue and reflection in the first third of the book.<br />Worth every minute of time devoted to reading this one.
B000002VRZ|3.0|I couldn't buy this CD fast enough, however, I am seriously bummed that it does not include the great song &quot;Holiday&quot; on it.
B000002KDW|5.0|After the first song. `Miss Judy's Farm', next is one of Ronnie Lane's most amusing and rascally  songs, `Your So Rude', basically just a cleverly played twelve bar stomper, but for this dog it is the lyrics that steal the day, opening up with...<br />  \\"My Mum She likes you, she thinks your swell,<br />  Got the makin's of a Dance Hall Girl,<br />  Your low-cut frock and your Bird's nest Hair,<br />  Stiletto heels and the way that you swear,<br />  She says to take you back to see my folks again on Sunday,<br />  Why it looks as though there's nobody in,<br />  They've all gone out to see my Auntie Renee.\\"<br /><br />I say be fair. Does that not bring a smile to the old laughing gear? Beautifully the band follows this with an emotional ballad `Love Lives Here`. The haunting organ chords from Ian McLagen prove that he knows exactly when to stick to the piano or when to bring out the Hammond Organ. About knocking down old homes and the memories that go with them, Rod Stewart has never sung better.<br />`Last Orders` by Ronnie Lane is a cruising, bluesing pub song about the misunderstanding between the sexes.<br />Then it is `Stay With Me` time. The hit single from the album is about as Faces as you can get. One of the best lads songs ever written. The entire band plays their collective hearts out, with everybody being given solo space as the song is brought to a thunderous conclusion at the end of its four and a half minute run. The sort of thing head banging was invented for. But still it is the lyrics that add wit and soul to the proceedings. Just before the band go wild, Rod sings out...<br />  \\"So, in the mornin', please don't say you love me,<br />  'Cause you know I'll only kick you out the door,<br />  Yeah, I'll pay your cab fare home,<br />  You can even use my best cologne,<br />  Just don't be here in the mornin' when I wake up.\\"<br /><br />Pace wise the foot is taken off the peddle for four and a half minutes for Ronnie Lane to sing his classic homage to growing up and becoming famous while leaving others behind, and to the duties that come with it.<br />But from here on out it is pure barnstorming Faces style good time music. A romp through Chuck's `Memphis` with some truly magnificent slide from Woody, the delights of being evicted from your own party `Too Bad', and the perfect closer in `That's All You Need'. The latter two Stewart/Wood compositions bring it all round in a circle in the style of `Miss Judy's Farm'.<br />Of course it couldn't last. After one more chart topping album (`Ohh La La` April 1975) Ronnie Lane left. Although he was replaced, it was never the same. As Rod Stewart gained more and more of the spot light, tension mounted, but it was the other Ronnie who left first. He joined `The Rolling Stones' as Mick Taylor's replacement, and eventually took Ian McLagan with him. Kenny Jones went on to the unenviable position of replacing Keith Moon in `The Who', and, of course, Rod Stewart went onto solo superstardom. However, to these old ears none of them ever reached this peak again.<br />As they say `A Nod's As Good As A Wink To A Blind Horse'. And if that is not enough for you, you could try their greatest hits album, which was released two years ago `Good Boys Whilst We Are Asleep'. It collects the best from all four albums plus assorted hit singles, but fortunately nothing from their dreadful live album `Coast to Coast`, which was recorded on their last tour of America, and did not find the Band on a good night. A dreadful shame really, as the period that this album comes from they were one of the best live Rock 'n' Roll band in the world.<br /> (...)You can even use my best cologne,<BR>                   Just don't be here in the mornin' when I wake up.\\"<BR>                   <BR>Pace wise the foot is taken off the peddle for four and a half minutes for Ronnie Lane to sing his classic homage to growing up and becoming famous while leaving others behind, and to the duties that come with it. <br />But from here on out it is pure barnstorming Faces style good time music.

B0000DDAU9|5.0|Mastodon were one of the big metal breakout bands of 2002, and were quickly heralded as one of the premiere metalcore acts in the world. I didn't get around to checking them out until fairly late in 2003. All I can say is better late than never, and if you are even a slight fan of 'extreme metal' you must check this out immediately.<br />The first thing that you are likely to notice when you listen to this album is the drumming.  To be perfectly blunt, I believe that this album has the greatest metal drumming performance that I've ever heard. Forget Christy and Hoglan and Portnoy and Mournier and Longstreh, Brann Dailor crushes them all.(And don't tell me that so and so is more technical; I don't care. I'm speaking from a purely subjective, artistic standpoint)  He's an utterly maniacal metal-fusion drummer who unleashes some truly spectacular and wildly shifting rhythms along with the most frenetic and powerful fills around. And it goes without saying that he can still groove with the best of them.  He plays with such unbelievable intensity and energy that even after dozens of listens he's still truly exhilirating to listen to every time.  Some might say he's too busy and overbearing, but he's just to damn fun to listen to, and most of the energy in the album comes from his performance. The rest of the band are no slouches, to be sure.  The guitars are extremely distorted, hissing and rasping wildly while they throw out some nicely varied riffs, ranging from crushing stoner or doom groove-riffs to bizarre, lightning-quick licks.  They manage to be crushingly heavy one second and surprisingly melodic and lucid the next. They also are clearly technical without being overly flashy, and thus never sacrifice groove or memorability for self-indulgent excesses.  The vox are first rate as well.  They are a somewhat monotonous and distorted roar (for the most part) which frequently provides a sort of base for the instrumental madness around them. They even manage to write some rather catchy vocal lines every now and then, rather surprising considering the anti-melodic nature of their basic style.<br />There are no throwaway tracks here, so I'll just cover a few highlights.  Crusher Destroyer(the songs have great names, by the way) is a massive opener. Dailor drums with unbelievable ferocity while the others throw out some unusual and highly abrasive riffs, which leads nicely to the more melodic section in the middle. Great Song. Workhorse is the absolute best track here.  A nice little intro cuts to an utterly fierce and stomping groove with an instantly memorable vocal line.  The breakdown in the middle is fabulous as well.  Trainwreck is calmer, more epic.  It's got some distinctive, softer and raspier vocals and some eerie melodic guitar which alternate with the most powerful groove riffs on the album.  The faster, more intense section later in the song brings it all together nicely. Probably the second best song. Elephant Man is a very solid, generally fairly mellow instrumental.  Lots of melody and some beautiful leads combine with a good amount of atmosphere and an understated but very real undercurrent of intensity which threatens to explode all throughout the track. The bonus track Emerald is very cool as well. A nice Thin Lizzy cover which both provides a good contrast to the rest of the album, yet still fits in very well.<br />But enough specifics.  Mastodon are one of the best new metal bands out there, and the best metalcore band around. Get it.ome rather catchy vocal lines every now and then, rather surprising considering the anti-melodic nature of their basic style.<br />There are no throwaway tracks here, so I'll just cover a few highlights.

Definetely!
B0000D96NW|5.0|Machine Head seem to be just about the most lamented metal band around.  Personally, I liked Burn My Eyes, but I didn't really find it to be truly extraordinary.  Good riffs, but the solos sucked and the vox were mediocre and it wasn't so good with dynamics.  Later came The Burning Red.  The vox were much improved, and they had a better grasp of dynamics, but it had gone pretty nu-metal, so the riffs suffered big time.  Still, I liked the advances they made in those other areas. Through the Ashes of Empires combines the positive aspect of those 2 albums, and comes out superior to either, imho.<br />As other reviewers have mentioned this album displays an attempt by Machine Head to move into the melodeath influenced metalcore movement which is so big in the underground right now.  However, it's not as derivative as all that, as it is essentially a rehashing/re-assembling of their older works that simply comes out that way.(This makes sense as metalcore and melodeath bands are often accused of being Nu-metal, and frequently use slowed down thrash riffs ala early Machine Head) This is a pretty good sound, though it isn't my absolute favorite.  Machine Head are atypically talented, however, so they standout pretty well when compared with most of the pack.<br />Sadly, although it combines the better elements of some of their different albums, each individual element isn't as good as it was at it's best in their earlier albums. I.E. The riffs are better than on The Burning Red but not as good as on Burn My Eyes, and the vox/dynamic/etc are better than on Burn My Eyes but worse than The Burning Red.  The riffs still aren't pure groove-thrash, as they still have some nu-metalish stuff every once in a while. Still generally good stuff, however.  It still has lots of atmospheric and spacy interludes, and I, unlike everyone else in the world, like them and think they are completely necessary.  They work especially well as they are juxtaposed next to real, hard-hitting riffs rather formless nu-metal walls of distortion. Flynn gives greatly a varied vocal performance roaring, howling and whispering along with some nice clean singing and some unexpected but very effective harmonizing.  As an added bonus, the leads are actually quite good here, though they are few in number.(Demmel's are good anyway. Flynn's still aren't too hot.)<br />This is a consistently entertaining album, and fairly varied as well.  Imperium is the most hyped song on the album, and it's pretty sweet.  Some fairly ferocious riffs and some nice interludes and solid vocals all through out. Left Unfinished is the most immediately memorable track, with a great chorus and strong metalcore-styled dynamics.  In the Presence of My Enemies is a good epic.  Another catchy chorus, a great thrash break and a simply ferocious breakdown at the end. Sweet solo too.  Vim is a very Burn My Eyes esque piece, probably moreso than any other track on the album, and is another standout.  The American bonus track Seasons Wither is probably the second best track here.  A solid opening is followed by a brilliant atmospheric break leading to an absolutely chilling vocal section.(the &quot;We pray you die&quot; part.)  The balladish Descend the Shades of Night is easily the best track here.  The simple acoustic intro is quite affecting, especially contrasted with the brutalizing, yet still melodic and memorable chorus.  It's got the best solo on the album, a great harmony lead and Flynn's best vocal performance. It is simply a great song, and is worth the price of the album alone.  It doesn't deviate too much from the standard metal ballad formula, but it's a damn good formula, and it's a damn good song.<br />All in all this is not quite the 'return to their roots' that Machine Head claimed it would be, but it's a very good album anyway.  Those of you who liked Burn My Eyes will probably like it, though it's not absolutley certain.  Those of you who, like myself, liked some of the melodic innovations of their later works but missed the older rhythm work ought to be delighted.  Sadly, the songwriting isn't quite as good as the individual elements of the band,(i.e. it's got a bit of enjoyable but fillerish material) so I can't give it a straight 5 stars, but it's still solid, and clearly leaves the door open for Machine Head to make their true masterpiece.tions of their later works but missed the older rhythm work ought to be delighted.

0316096199|5.0|This book was beautifully written. The author uses the audiences attention by starting with the story first and then recapturing the events that took place afterword.  She keeps the reader on their toes by her amazing description of events. <BR>   Alice Sebold shows how she overcame her rape and was able to survive it.  She told what happened to her and how it effected the lives around her.  She overcame what everyone else tried to forget.  She got revenge and lost some friends for it and gained some new ones.  She was handed lemons and made lemonade.
B00005JMFQ|4.0|I think that if this movie had been made with only American actors and taken place in America the critics would have slammed it as just more Yankee treacle.  Does giving these sitcom-ish characters accents elevate this flick to classic status?  I think not.<br />It is a lightweight, forgettable, date film.  Rent it.
B00008H2LB|1.0|linkin park. combining the worst of the worlds of \\"rock\\" and rap, i cant understand how they can brainwash people into buying their stuff.  the vocals cant get any more emotionless, between the monotone rapping and the dull singing, you wont find any energy.  needless to say the guitars absolutly suck, it seems like these guys are thrilled they can play a couple lame riffs.  and seriously, what kind of band has like 20 people in it?  yeah, spray paint is pretty cool.  my brother likes spray paint.  hes in 6th grade.  linkin park is group of 30 year olds in a \\"rock band.\\"  enough said.  if you want some rock, dont buy this cd, and if you want rap, dont buy this cd, and if you want a hybrid, definetly dont buy this cd.  like i said, it even makes a crappy coaster.
B0000CFW87|5.0|Once again, Josh Groban has put together another fabulous collection of songs, co-writing three of them and playing piano on \\"Remember When It Rained\\" (one that he co-wrote). His  rich, soothing baritone voice has gotten stronger and even more beautiful since his debut. On this CD we are treated to songs in Italian, English, Spanish and French. Even though we can't understand the lyrics, the meaning of the songs shines through. This second CD from Josh is an enchanting collection of romantic, emotionally charged music-I think it is even better than the first, if that is possible. After seeing him in concert, all of the songs have been brought to life-there is not one that I will skip! I listen to it constantly-on the computer at home, work, and the car. I'm sure that anyone who liked the first CD will fall in love with this one, and he should gain some new fans with it. If there aren't any Grammy nominations for closer, I will be surprised!
B00005JMJ4|2.0|I gave this film two stars because firstly amazon requires one star and secondly the acting or lack of is, to use the cliched term, 'real'. Kudos to Scarlett Johansson and Bill Murray! And also for cutie Anna Faris for adding a few funny moments.<br />This film is no way a \\"masterpiece\\". For starters it is NOT original. It's the basic 'fish out of water' story minus any comedy or social commentary or character devlopment or anything else common to similar themed films. The film is plotless and pointless, which I can easily forgive if it had atmoshphere, emotion, action, humor, substance, eroticism or anything, this film has nothing!<br />This is NOT an artistic film either. The neon colored street-scapes of Tokyo would look just as impressive if this was a porno. Really, this film's only redeaming attribute is that of the actors performances, when one considers that they adlibbed most of their lines, Sofia Coppola's writing and directing deserve no praise.<br />Really 90 minutes of Sofia's death scene from her virtuoso performance in \\"Godfather III\\" looped over and over again would be a more rewarding veiwing experience. Don't beleive the hype, there is no more substance in this film than of the other shallow garbage curned out in Hollywood!
B000001E29|3.0|This is probably very nice to drink whiskey and smoke cigars to. As a piece of musical theatre it is mainly confusing. <br />I have never seen any actual production of this so called (?) musical play, neither does the booklet offer an understandable synopsis. Yet do few if any of these songs seem to do anything like furthering the plot, develop characters or even comment on the action. <br />\\"Mood pieces\\" also occationally pop up in dramaturgic settings, but they do not form a complete musical alone. <br />Breaking the rules within the frames of musical theatre is of course seldom anything but excellent. But to break those rules one must first know and understand them. One's mind invariably turns to the master Sondheim. In the end The Black Rider turns out to be more like a play with songs than a musical.<br />One subjective demand I make for songs is that they ought to be good to sing. These songs seem dependent on mr Waits' voice, and simply do not \\"lay well\\" in the mouth.. <br />If you wish background music, this is probably no worse a choice than anything else. If you wish to experience real musical theatre, try something like Sweeney Todd instead.
B000000T01|4.0|I loved the film - and would have given it 5 stars if Rick Danko had been in it, as advertised!
B000001E7L|5.0|Many Cranfans were born with this sophmore album.  It is truly amazing to listen to an album start to finish and enjoy almost every minute of it.  The major singles \\"Ode To My Family\\", \\"Zombie\\", and \\"Ridiculous Thoughts\\" make it a must own all by themselves, and the rest are definitely worth hearing too.  Loud to soft, innocent to political, this is the Cranberries most eclectic and best sounding album so far.
B0000AZJXQ|5.0|I dont think this album is as good as the first. The Outsider is with out a doubt the best APC song ever. The only thing wrong with this album is that they dont rock enough. They have the talent but just dont to it. But overall its a good album. Its sort of like a mellowed out version of Tool. If you liked the first album or any tool songs then pick this up.
B0000C6E4D|3.0|It has been a long time since Sarah McLachlan has released a new studio album.  While \\"Afterglow\\" delivers for her mainstay fans, this album is a bit of a let-down.  Almost every song is eerily quiet.  \\"Fumbling Toward Ecstacy\\" & \\"Surfacing\\" have some upbeat tracks and deliver more of a variety.  The best are the three singles: \\"Fallen\\", \\"Stupid\\", and \\"World's On Fire\\".  \\"Push\\" also jumps out.
B00005JMEW|5.0|I confess that I had no expectation before I'd seen the volume1.I thought it would be like other Action movies.Unfortunately,I was so impressed with the whole movie.It has a unique style with many artistic scenes.I love the japanese cartoon scene&lt;introducing the character of O-Ren.&gt;,it's rare to see in other movies.<BR>  Another thing I've admired is the acting of Uma Thurman.She done a great job in this.I don't know why she's missed the Oscar Nomination for the Best Actress in 2003 ceremony.She deserves it!<BR>  In Thailand,there were many negative reviews about this movie because of its violence.Do you believe there were just 10 people in the cinema when I saw the volume2?Some might think it would be the same violent as the first part.For me,the blood-spattered scenes didn't annoy me at all.It's not because I'm a sadist,but if it was not violent,it would not have been the Quentin Tarantino's style.If you know this and cannot accept it,you can ignore it.<BR>  To conclude,Kill Bill Vol.1 is my most favourite Action movie.But it's not a movie for everyone.<BR>P.S.I'm disappointed with the volume 2.It's not the same:'(
B000089RVR|4.0|Dido returns with \\"Life For Rent\\", the follow-up to her debut album \\"No Angel\\".  Similar to it's predecessor, some tracks on the new album jump out immediately while the few others are leftovers.  The standouts are \\"White Flag\\", the title track \\"Life For Rent\\", \\"See You When You're 40\\", \\"Sand In My Shoes\\", and the incredible album finish \\"See The Sun\\".  Many of the tracks are an unlayered Dido singing over drum loops, accompanied by just keyboards and/or an acoustic guitar.  There is also a 'hidden' track.  See The Sun ends about 5:00 into track 11, and at about 7:04 another song begins.
B000068FUM|3.0|Not sure which song has anybody excited here. I bought this one a few years back and listened to it 10-12 times before it found it's way among the rarely listened-to CD's. This is fine music, but nothing very memorable. The cover of Grand Funk's &quot;Bad Time&quot; is very good, but doesn't improve on the original.  The opening track, Blue is also a good one.  The singing, playing all just okay and the songwriting also just fine.  There are several tracks that I just skip by.  It's very easy to find better music than this.
B000089RVX|5.0|When you take away all of this supposed commercialism and get down to it, Amy Lee has a fantastic, powerful, unique voice.  While the musical backing to some of the songs sounds similar, each song is made it's own by lyrics that are dark yet relatable and somewhat inspirational.  It is easy to point the finger at media and claim that bands such as this are overrated, but by doing so you are buying into the very thing you claim to be against.  Give Fallen a chance and make your own decisions about this incredible album.  You'll be glad you listened to the album instead of listening to all of the media-driven critic hype.  If all of the \\"similar bands\\" that Evanescence is supposely ripping off of are so great, why aren't they on the top of the charts?  And if they were, people would be ripping them apart just like they are Evanescence.  Make your own decisions, but at least give them a chance.

B00008S2VG|4.0|This album is pretty impressive.  American Life, Hollywood, Love Profusion, Nothing Fails, Intervention, & X-Static Process are all worth a listen.  Madonna is getting to the basics and throwing in a little synth, with an impressive end result.
B00003CXA6|5.0|Having viewed this film several times, and compelled to see it in 70mm on the Big Screen a dozen more, I suppose you could say I am entirely enthusiastic about it.  And you would be correct.  There are few films that parallel in quality the book upon which they are based...&quot;Gettysburg&quot; does the Pulitzer Prize-Winning &quot;The Killer Angels&quot; justice...and then some.  On first viewing, one cannot help but be amazed by the scope of the drama, supported as it is by thousands of Civil War re-enactors without whom such a feat would not be possible.<br />This film brings all that is important about the great struggle to define our nation, through the bloodiest conflict in American history, and on our on soil, into a sharper focus. It covers major issues and personalities, as does Michael Shaara's book, and shows how men could be so devoted to a struggle on such a grand scale, and face it with seeming fearlessness.<br />If this is just your start in considering the Civil War, or a waystation on your way to try to understand why it continues to compel many to study, or try to experience some face of it, you'll do well to direct your personal journey through this film.<br />At one point, two academics (Joshua Lawrence Chamberlain and Strong Vincent, of Bowdoin and Harvard Colleges), are face to face, and Vincent says, &quot;Now, we'll see how professors fight.&quot;  It was that kind of conflict.  All of America was involved, in some way, and while we are now involved in a greater conflict, one seemingly more abstract at times, this great film will bring the reality, the glory, the horror of armed conflict into closer focus.  It happened here, on American soil, and men who felt as brothers sometimes found themselves just a short distance across from one another, commanding men under them to certain death to make a point--that there would be henceforth one nation, or two.<br />There is hope in this film...and when you find it, you will have more of a sense of what it means to be an American--and it will change what you thought or felt.what it means to be an American--and it will change what you thought or felt.

B00005NGZX|5.0|Metal used to be the sort of thing where you would plug in your guitar, get a nice heavy sound, write good riffs, and that was pretty much it. As the years have gone by, it's impressive to see how some bands have taken the aesthetic to _this_ level.<br />Converge is generally regarded as THE hardcore/metalcore band. I don't really know what those terms mean, but this is just a beast of an album. I've listened to so much death metal, grindcore, black metal, cyber-terminator metal, and so on, now it is rare that a band impresses with its sheer heaviness. But Converge _is_ heavy enough to bring you to your knees: massive, crushing riffs with guitar distortion that could strip flesh from bones; heart-stopping grooves of exploding shrapnel; and deliriously thick walls of sound... As a compadre recently said while we were discussing this album, \\"When 'Concubine' kicks in, hold on to your f_cking chair.\\" But real heaviness is not just a sound, it also has a lot to do with how that sound is manipulated and performed. For instance, King Crimson is, in my opinion, much 'heavier' than nearly any 'metal' band. Converge is an excellent example of this theory in practice, as they pound through eclectic, wrecking ball riffs and industrial-strength rhythms at breathless velocities while vocalist Jacob Bannon's inhuman screams crackle across the scorched-earth metalcore landscape with spine-tingling ferocity. (Is that a human voice? Is he hurting himself doing that?) On the moments where he sings rather than screams, he has a sort of weird-indie voice.<br />And part of that visceral impact Converge plasters you with comes from their gritty, rugged sound. The music is most certainly not _sloppy_ -- Converge's technique is highly refined around their frenetic, short, violent bursts, mammoth drumming, aggressive stop-starts and syncopations. But the album has a fast, dirty sound could be interpreted as \\"punk\\" were the songs not so complex, brutal, and heavy. (That's that \\"hardcore\\" factor, yo.)<br />And just when you think you have their sound pegged, along comes the 12-minute title track of _Jane Doe_: it first trudges through clomping heaviness for a while and then - and THEN -- it finishes with an electric crescendo that would stagger Godspeed You! Black Emperor. It's one of the most powerful moments in the world of heavy music.<br />Highest recommendation. And if you love DEP, you will love this I think.ctor, yo.) <br />And just when you think you have their sound pegged, along comes the 12-minute title track of _Jane Doe_: it first trudges through clomping heaviness for a while and then - and THEN -- it finishes with an electric crescendo that would stagger Godspeed You!

B000002B1M|5.0|Nas is the man. Every track on this CD is banging. Alot of people said that Nas went pop, and that's not true. Nas was just trying some new things and experimenting with his sounds a little. Nas is not Ja Rule. He's never sold us out and how dare the people online who write their reviews say that about him.  The CD kicks out with an intro and then it automatically jumps into fire mode with the first track, &quot;The Message&quot;. Over a hot beat, Nas rips this track down to shreads. The heat keeps coming with songs like &quot;Street Dreams&quot; and &quot;I Gave You Power&quot;. This is an amazing song because Nas actually challenges the listener to think that he is a gun. The only weak track on this CD is the Dr. Dre produced &quot;Nas is Coming&quot; which has an annoying chorus. Everything else it hot though.<br />Highly Recommended CD.<br />- Dwayne
B00008H2LB|1.0|I tried, I realy tried people.Everybody is always telling me how great LinKin Park is, and how i have to run out and buy the CD. But i just cant listen to these no talent hacks anymore. Everybody acts like these guys invented rap-rock. Hello, have you ever heard of real bands like Faith No More and the Chile Peppers who where doing this long before these guys knew how to walk. Please people if we keep supporting this crap Record companys will keep putting it out. Do all of us  a favor save your 20 bucks. DONT ENCOURAGE THEM

0060989157|3.0|I'll be honest with you, I am not a Motley Crue fan. I can't think of a single song they do that doesn't make me cringe. HOWEVER, I can understand why others might like them so I am not going to sit here and diss on them. When I saw this book I was intrigued enough to flip through it. I read a few passages and decided to start at the beginning. Every member of the Crue has the chance to speak their mind and the author does a good job of letting them do it in their own voice (though Tommy Lee's excessive use of the word \\"dude\\" has the effect of nails on a chalkboard). Everything from the band's execessive drug use to the fights and wild sexual escapades are covered in great detail. Nikki Sixx, though bitter, comes across as the most sensible. His anger and family history is one of the most enjoyable aspects of the book. Unfortunately, the tragedy of Vince Neil's daughter's death should have been emotional but he diminishes the impact by continuing to namedrop and act the braggart. As the most unlikeable character in the book, talking about his daughter's death should have gained my sympathy but it didn't. Maybe he really did throw up on Kelsey Grammar but the way he talks it's like he has this air of superiority and arrogance (\\"I know Kelsey Grammar and Shannon Doherty and you don't\\"), when in fact he is really nothing more than a second rate David Lee Roth. Also, Tommy Lee's assertion that the Crue should have played with real bands like Iggy Pop and Husker Du instead of pop-metal fluff like Warrant and Poison really bugged me. It's as if he and Nikki mistakenly thought they were in a band of the same calibre of the Stooges or Pistols and were oblivious to the fact that they were a fluffy pop metal band. All the band members diss on their contemporaries (Guns N Roses, etc) as if they were somehow better than them. Motley Crue started the whole pop metal genre and imitation is the most sincere form of flattery so it's kind of sad when they call Poison and Whitesnakelame. Still, if you want to read about weird sex orgies, mass drug use, big brawls, wasted money and celebrity dirt then you will enjoy this book. I even enjoyed it. I still don't like Motley Crue though.
B00003CXXP|3.0|Although never actually said in the movie, this is basically an updated, modernised, robot-ised version of Pinocchio. A Disney movie that was never among my favourites when I was young and still thought Disney movies were the bees knees. Straight away, I see the similarities between this and Pinocchio, just by watching the two trailers - which did nothing to make me WANT to watch the movie, even though I was going to anyway. (They were `teaser' trailers - which didn't really show you very much!) However, knowing that Stan Winston was involved in the special effects did encourage me.<br />The film's two big stars are Haley Joel Osment, who is still in his Sixth Sense little cutie role, and Jude Law, who looks very strange in this. Very plastic, but intentionally so. To begin with, Haley's character, David, was so annoying; I wanted to slap him. And then I wanted to slap his `brother' Martin even more. Both very annoying sounding and looking children. But if you're the kind of person (like me) who can't stand the annoying little brats, then don't worry. Martin doesn't appear that much in the movie, and I really grew to like David after a while - although it took until he was left at the bottom of the swimming pool, and then made to survive for himself. I was nearly in tears at those bits, and couldn't understand why his `mommy' left him outside in the big, bad world to fend for himself. She, after all, was the one who `activated' him, to make him love her or something like that. And she couldn't put him back to the company who made him, as he'd get destroyed. The whole section where she tries to leave him in the middle of god-knows-where, is very heartwrenching, as David desperately clings to her. David seems to do a lot of \\"clinging\\" in this movie, whether it's following the mother around, trying to protect himself, or attaching himself to Jude Law, which provides a hilarious line from Jude: \\"Well, it's certainly my good fortune running into you!\\"<br />Jude Law isn't one of my favourite actors, and seems to appear more in the press than in relatively good movies. He was great in this though, whether it was playing a robot that would give women lots of \\"pleasure\\", or the connection he had with David. Despite not wanting to be taken where David was going, he couldn't get David to let go of his hand, and they ended up becoming the most unlikely friends. Even \\"Gigolo Joe\\" helped David in the end. I thought his `story' was never resolved, although it's most likely he ended up in a flesh fair. So not fair.<br />I found this film to be rather jumpy, and it jumped almost abruptly, skipping periods of time. I was left unsatisfied at the end of the movie, although I'm glad that the relationship between David and his `mommy' was resolved at the end. It's a very sad ending.<br />This movie had big similarities to Bicentennial Man, and also The Wizard Of Oz - the whole going to see Doctor Know, to find the Blue Fairy, is similar to going to find the \\"wonderful wizard of oz\\". And obviously, Pinocchio. There's even some parallels with Blade Runner where the robots are ostracised.<br />The star of this movie? In my opinion, it isn't Jude Law or even the adorable (yet bratty to begin with) Haley Joel Osment. Instead, it's the absolutely gorgeous, the number one Supertoy, Teddy! (I want one!!) I thought he was adorable, and was the star of this movie. I can't tell you how many times I watched the scene where Martin &amp; David are trying to get Teddy to come to one of them. And as soon as he sees the mother, he's off shouting \\"Mommy! Mommy!\\" It's also so cute how he runs. Or when he get separated from David at the flesh fair, he keeps asking \\"Where's David? Can you help me find David? Are you taking me to David?\\" Or when that device is scanning him at the flesh fair and he puts on this little growly face! Awww! The end scene featuring him, is the saddest ever. What happened to him?<br />I'm not sure what to think of this movie. I enjoyed it, butI found myself not being able to understand what was going on a lot of the time. It's not a film I would watch again, and it's also an incredibly long film, feels a lot longer than the 2 hours 20 minutes it actually is.<br />And my final thought for this review is: \\"Mommy! Mommy!\\"I found myself not being able to understand what was going on a lot of the time.

B00005NB0H|5.0|Visceral. Pounding. Glorious rock and roll!! This is their absolute best recorded work. John Entwistle, Pete Townshend, Roger Daltrey, and Keith Moon function like a single mind--a pulsating single organism, producing wave after wave of jaw-dropping sound. Every instrument is played like a lead instrument, but no one is upstaging. There's plenty of improvisation (including a little stand-up comedy between songs). You can just feel Townshend planning ahead, while always keeping us in the moment; and you think &quot;does this song have an end?...hooray, no it doesn't!...Keep playing, keep playing!&quot;. <br />I don't know how they can keep singing harmony (and sometimes syncopated vocals) --especially Entwistle's singing high harmony while playing bass-- while they continue to produce jazzy complex riffs with frequently changing rhythmic and style patterns...And I just know that, if I could see them, they'd been leaping and gyrating all over the stage in typical athletic Who fashion....wow, Wow, WOW!
B0001MDQ2G|5.0|great album......... those who like engaging music get this...<br />his vocal styling is great... the music is just great..<br />every serious muso should get this.. i cant get halo dies outta my head..<br />who woulda thought such an amazing album came from isreal
B0001K9IJ8|5.0|First of all, although I was a bit hedgy about it at first, &quot;The Girl in the Other Room&quot; is a totally GREAT CD (see my review of the simpler enhanced version).  The more I listen to it, the more I've become addicted to it.  Aside from the late, great Peggy Lee, no other singer comes to mind who combines coolness with warmth, mystery with frankness, glamour with earthiness, and subtlety with thoroughness.  Diana, you give me heart palpitations, and that's a compliment!<br />Since I was totally impressed by the mixing and mastering on the regular edition, I couldn't wait to get my hands on the Super Audio version. Truthfully, the awesome sound detail on the Super Audio CD is SO impressive, it is almost difficult for my human ears to drink it all in.  There's a LOT going on from five different speakers and a woofer, all blended beautifully.  The most striking feature about the SACD is a longer, slightly different version of the opening song &quot;Stop This World&quot;, so if you're a Diana fan, believe me, this is an absolute must-have!  And if you don't have a 5.1 system, what the heck are you waiting for?  For audiophiles, it is worth EVERY penny.  I highly recommend Sony's 5.1 CD/DVD audio.
B00009V7T2|5.0|After the split of At the Drive-In, Cedric Bixler-Zavala and Omar Rodriguez-Lopez set out on an expedition to create music that pushed the boundaries of rock and roll. Towards the end of ATDI, Omar commented that their music made him feel &quot;musically bankrupt, spiritually bankrupt.&quot; Hence, The Mars Volta was born.<br />Following on the heels of the Tremulant EP, there were great expectations of &quot;De-Loused,&quot; and many questions remained about the direction of the newly-formed band. Omar and Cedric decided to go on the risky route of prog rock, and mixed the beaker even more by creating a concept album. Delving into the depths of darkness, TMV paints a psychedlic, haunting picture of a man who falls into a drug-induced coma, awakens, and chooses to release from the horrors of reality by killing himself.<br />There is not one word that can accurately discribe this monster of an album except for mind-blowing. From the quick buildup of &quot;Son et Lumiere&quot; to the rip-roaring conclustion of &quot;Take the Veil Cerpin Taxt&quot;, the Mars Volta takes the listener on a roller coaster ride through a plethora of emotions. Track 1 puts the figurative bullet into the pistol, which is then unloaded in &quot;Inertiatic ESP,&quot; a guitar-heavy fireball. &quot;Roulette Dares,&quot; the proceeding track, takes the listner to the highest heights of hope, then rushes down to the dreary depths. <br />The journey reaches a wandering stage with &quot;Tira Me a La Aranas,&quot; an acoustic track which slowly melts into my personal favorite on the album, &quot;Drunkship of Lanterns.&quot; The track begins with a heavy salsa flavor, and continues the heavy theme of the album through the first 4.5 minutes. Then, a breakdown into a southern-style riff ensues, and the listener reaches a climax of sorts at the mid-point of the album. &quot;Eria Tarka&quot; follows, with one of the most solid choruses to come from a group in while. The entire album can be summarized inone track, &quot;Cicatriz ESP&quot;, which follows &quot;Eria Tarka.&quot; RHCP guitarist John Frusciante chimes in, and the rhythm is captivating. After a 3-minute instrumental which sounds as if it is painting a picture of the bottom of city sewers or a dark prison cell, the track kicks into full gear and rips up what dreary feelings were left.<br />&quot;This Apparatus Must be Unearthed,&quot; my personal least favorite track, is next. There is very little rhythm or flow to this song; it seems like a playground for the instrumentalists to do their own thing. &quot;Televators&quot; appears next, and seems to be a drug-induced dream or vision. Bixler soars on this acoustic track, his high-pitched tone carrying blissfully yet assuredly. Finally, &quot;Take the Veil Cerpin Taxt&quot; appears. This song is much in the form of &quot;Cicatriz ESP,&quot; with a quick first couple minutes and a long instrumental to bridge the gap between beginning and end. The last 90 seconds are, quite simply, awe-inspring, as everyone in the band plays to their full potential, and the alarm/panic in Bixler's voice puts the listener on full alert.<br />Overall, there is much to be excited about concerning the Mars Volta. The only question remaining: where do they go from here? It will certianly be difficult to create a sophomore album that matches the significance of the debut, and prog rock is never an easy genre to continually exceed in. As I eagerly await, I must note that no CD has ever received more playing time than &quot;De-Loused in the Comatorium,&quot; which I give a full thumbs-up to.
B000002L68|5.0|Prince first captivated me in the Purple Rain days &amp; I have been a huge fan ever since.  From his debut in 1979 with &quot;For You&quot;, through his 25 years of musical and artistic brilliance, to his current Doctorate with Musicology I have adored this prince.  Here it is 20 years after the release of Purple Rain &amp; every time I listen to this amazing album I am in awe.  You can't sit still &amp; you forget all your worries.  What a freaken genius this man is.  There is no other &amp; will never be another like him.  Not only is he a brilliant musician, but he performs like no other.  There is no other artist that can completely captivate his audience like he does.  I ABSOLUTELY LOVE HIM!!!!!
1572814136|5.0|Although, I am just in the beginning stages of Tarot reading, I have already used the cards to experience some revealing dynamics about my own life path and personality. I used the concept of \\"The Trinity.\\"-Past, Present, and Future. The Tarot cards are for all those people that are under what I call \\"Evolutionary Pressure.\\" This is an inner longing or urging if you will, to know oneself in a deeper way that cannot be fully captured by popular culture. If you are sincere about using the cards, you will get an answer from them and they will resonate with your truth!<br />In response to what the previous reviewer mentioned, I didn't notice any smell at all when I opened my deck. What I did notice though was the bright beautiful colors. The colors seem to elicit a strong reaction in me. I have also noticed that the images themselves seem to \\"speak\\" more than some of the other so called \\"new\\" decks. There has to be a reason why this deck is the most copied in existence. This deck and Crowley's Thoth deck compliment each other so well that I can't imagine needing much more than this.<br />All you need to get started really is the Radiant Rider-Waite desk and the book \\"Seventy-Eight Degrees of Wisdom\\" and you will be well on your way to learning the nuances of the Tarot.

0156012197|4.0|At first, The Little Prince was like an ordinary fantasy story for children. With people living on stars and talking flowers, i was surprised that it was chosen as an 8th grade reading novel. As i read this chosen class picture book, i soon understood how its very meanigful, thought-provoking metaphores may be what is so special and hard to understand about the book. In my opinion, i think that some of the metaphores mensioned are a little too confusing to interpret. I believe that for younger readers, they will probably be able to read the book as a fantasy novel. For older readers, beginning at around my age, i believe is able to read this in a metaphorical way. It is very meaningful and gives a lot of thoughts for readers.
1400034205|3.0|'The Razor's Edge' is usually billed as the story of Larry Darrell, a young man on a spiritual journey.  However, the bulk of the text concerns Elliott Templeton, as he journeys from middle to old age, as a garrulous, opinionated, in some sense well-meaning, but in many ways tragically limited character.  His motivations remain overtly uncharted, yet much is implied.  Prime among these implications is his sexual orientation.<BR>*<BR>Maugham himself is the narrator and a character in this novel; hence, it's not unreasonable to think that his own life history would be relevant to the book.  Jeffrey Meyer's recent biography, available on Amazon, is a good source of information.  Maugham was married, unhappily, and during the Second World War, openly admitted his homosexuality, living as a homosexual for the rest of his long life.  He published 78 books, selling over 40 million copies.  Many, if not all, his characters were reportedly based on people he knew in real life.  There are suggestions, then, that Elliott is an amalgam of several persons, possibly even of some aspects of Maugham himself. It's worth bearing in mind that homosexuality was illegal in England at the time the book was written. This in itself might go some way to explaining why certain matters are implied rather than directly addressed. <BR>*<BR>The Larry Darrell character is less insightfully presented that one might expect.  He seems more the object of infatuation of several of the characters, not least of Maugham himself.  As such, he is indulged, even when his actions might, objectively, be objectionable or obscure.  His ruminations upon mysticism, in particular, are related by Maugham in a spirit of tolerance, with the occasional, very much muffled, hint of skepticism.  His physical appearance, in contrast, is openly admired and, rather repetitiously, drawn to the reader's attention.<BR>*<BR>The treatment of the female characters is far less sympathetic, but, for that, far more realistic.  Theyare variously portrayed as hedonistic, materialistic, lost, and mothering.  Their lusts are generally far more earthy than those of the ethereal Larry.  They are also capable of far greater hatred, as a particular turn in the plot reveals.  <BR>*<BR>It's tempting to accuse Maugham of a certain degree of misogyny, except that it would be more accurate to label him a misanthopist, and indeed he has been labelled so;  the fact that Larry escapes his scorn is less a contradiction of this indictment than a reflection of Larry's insubstantiality - his actions and personality are hardly human, approaching more those of an archetypal saint figure.<BR>*<BR>The writing style is very readable, without ever becoming elevated and enjoyable for its own sake.  This is in keeping with the book's wide popularity.  <BR>*<BR>Personally, I was very surprised by the difference between the book's reputation and its reality.  If you are intrigued by Elliott Templeton and Maugham himself, then this will be an interesting read, as much for what is not said as for what is; if, however, Larry is the lure, then much will remain elusive.
B0001UL7RY|5.0|This is a great rock album! Avril has definatly improved on her singing and her guitar riffs. Songs like \\"Don't tell me\\" and \\"Together\\" are really awesome songs. This album is way better than her first album. \\"Under my skin\\" is a lot more darker, more about feelings and relationships that have come and gone. It's way less \\"poppy\\" than her first album \\"let go\\" So personally I think that album is great listening no matter where you are. Get it and see for yourself!<BR>Buh byes!!!
B00018D44U|4.0|I had a surprising reaction to Norah Jones' &quot;Feels Like Home&quot; after listening to the record for the first time - was my money well spent? I personally am not a big fan of country, and it seems that Jones added more of a country feel to this record rather than jazz, and it turned me off at first. Because of that I skip songs like &quot;Creepin' In&quot; (Dolly Parton or not) and &quot;Long Way Home.&quot; This is a different Norah, and while I compliment her for changing, those songs strike the wrong cords for me.<br />Still, this is an incredible record. She pretty much keeps the same formula that won her five grammies, and it's successful yet again. Songs like &quot;Sunrise,&quot; &quot;The Prettiest Thing,&quot; and &quot;Don't Miss You at All&quot; sound like the Norah of old. The country songs that I mentioned before don't do it for me, but the tracks that are stand-alone terrific on this record are two slower-paced ones, &quot;Humble Me,&quot; and my personal favorite, &quot;Carnival Town.&quot; Those two songs show you how powerful a song can be without being loud or involving too many instruments. So, overall, a changeup for Norah with a couple iffy songs which are accounted for by dependable and incredible tracks which we seeing coming from Norah more and more now.
B0001HLVS2|5.0|One reason that going to a movie theatre hasn't been killed by video is that some movies are simply spectacular on the big screen. When I watched Master and Commander on DVD I knew I missed out by not seeing it in a movie theatre. If not for Return of the King it may have walked off with most of the Oscars it was nominated for. But more than that, the acting, dialogue, characterization and action are all first-rate. Russell Crowe really is a terrific actor, bringing to life the serious Captain Jack of the high seas in 2003. The other performances are also humane and realistic, especially those of the boys in the crew of the Surprise. The cat-and-mouse plot doesn't intrude on the characterizations, but creates a tension that brings out the essential qualities of each character, allowing me to identify with what it might be like to experience what they are experiencing. Master and Commander tells its story in an intelligent, thoughtful manner without compromising the excitement, terror and tension of naval warfare.
B0000AQS0F|5.0|My roomate recommended this series highly, and one boring Sunday afternoon we had nothing to do and he says, &quot;JD, we're watching 'Firefly.'&quot; I was a bit excited about it at first, since my roomate knew I liked history and science fiction. I knew it was Joss Whedon, who wrote the script for &quot;Alien Resurrection&quot; (which I liked) but I never got to liking &quot;Angel&quot; or &quot;Buffy.&quot; So I'd figure it was worth a shot, and boy, was I surprised. We watched the first disc and some of the second disc straight through. I laughed, I sighed, I screamed, I enjoyed. I had never seen anything like this before. When we finished the series, and later watched the special features, I knew I had to buy it.<br />You can read the Amazon review for the plot. It won't take much to adapt to the &quot;Whedonese&quot; or the chinese cursing. What really will get your attention is that there aren't any aliens at all through the run, and the characters are flat out amazing. As a writer myself, the characters that Whedon creates are some of the best that I've ever watched on TV or film. Incredible writing and special effects augment this series, along with the plain reality of it all. So it's 500 years in the future. Who says we've got warp speed? Who says violence has ended? Whedon sticks it plain when the crew of the Serenity are looking for jobs to keep them afloat rather than make first contact with an alien race.<br />There are plenty of little things that you will enjoy from this collection. The camera and special effects take advantage of the zoom lens (which you'll learn in the features section that mostly everyone not with the &quot;Firefly&quot; team thought was cheesy). The music is incredible. For example, since space is a vacuum, we don't hear anything in the CGI scenes except for wonderful violins and guitars. You see the cast is really a family when the camera stops, and when you watch the &quot;making of&quot; featurette, you'll see how heartbreaking it was for this cast to all of a sudden wrap up and end production.<br />The cast! Whedon strings together a cast of actors that most people don't know. Nathan Fillion (TV's &quot;Two Guys, A Girl, and a Pizza Shop&quot;) and Adam Baldwin (various movies and appearances) are the biggest names you might know. But, either way, the actors stick their characters without any flaws. Apparently 10 million viewers weren't enough for Fox, who pretty much killed this series. Props to Universal for producing the 2005 movie, which may just be the first in a trilogy. Either way, expect Fox to be brooding for a long time.
0375432302|1.0|Dan Brown seemed to be on every bestseller list in the world so I decided to find out what was so great about his books. I read The Da Vinci Code and I surely don't know why so many people want to read this boring book. The thin plot is spread through pages and pages of copy/page like information out of &quot;more than you ever wanted to know about ... &quot; pamphlets. I could skip a good deal of the book and still know what happened.<br />A good thriller is so tightly written that one doesn't want to miss a word. Dan Brown should read Frances Fyfield to find out about good thriller writing.

B00003Q43A|5.0|Firstly, you're amazed by the alien ship that appears, curious about the contingency plan, and then completely blown away by the explosions and special effects. This is American patriotism at its very best, yet you forget all of that with the amount of action, comedy and typical plotlines. Ok, so the acting wasn't THAT great, but you can watch this film a hundred times and never get bored. There one liners always crack you up, and once again, America is always the one that saves the day! <br />A simple plot - aliens threaten the world's (more so America's) existence and someone (America) has to do something about it. With a cast led by Bill Pullman, Jeff Goldblum and (at the time) an aspiring Will Smith, that were all very good to watch, not forgetting the rather nice looking Vivica A. Fox as Smith's fianc? I can't really put a flaw in this film since it was great fun to see. God bless America! <br />Done in true US Military style, 'Independence Day' is an entertaining, patriotic watch - one big dose of eye candy which can be seen again and again.
B00005JLWN|5.0|I just saw this movie an hour ago..<br />First let me say, I saw that it was on sale on a swedish order-page, so before I ordered I had to read some about it here. <BR>It was kinda weird, because I had never heard about it, and that weird considering Im a kind of a movie-buff... movies are my life..<br />The mixed opinions were one thing, but what shocked me was that people either REALLY loved it or REALLY hated it.. rip of matrix and stuff like that..<br />Well this is my opinion.. <BR>Yes I rated it to be 5, because I simply loved it.. I honestly can't understand why people even compare it to Matrix. I found very little that was Matrix styled. The only thing I can remember was the underground rebells, which you see on a lot of movies, so why bother the compare there?<br />The first movie that struck my mind was Gattaca, it was the same atmosphere.. and wow, what an atmosphere.. <br />im NOT gonna go into details about the movie, and i recommend that you just see it without reading any spoiling reviews. <br />This movie was really original, it was kinda original like when I first saw Matrix(but im not comparing the stories) im just saying that it was as surprising as matrix. <br />There is lots of action in the movie, mixed with emotional thoughts. It was a very deep and intense story. It was kinda dark to. This movie has a lot of style. The very crazy and original GunKata was amazing as well, but what really had me hooked was Christian Bales intense and cool acting. <br />I dont care if Neo was the one, I think Christian would have KICKED SOME NEO ASS!!!
B000050FEN|5.0|A film that genuinely gets better with repeated viewings, Se7en is a dark, depressing and disturbing tale which simply refuses to give the audience any grain of comfort. Brad Pitt proves for perhaps the first time in his career (forget his over-rated antics in Twelve Monkeys) that he is an edgy, dangerous actor with a good eye for an atypical role. Morgan Freeman consolidates his reputation as a consummate performer, playing the methodical, patient foil to Pitt's volatile man of action.<br />However, Se7en isn't just a straightforward thriller about the hunt for a serial killer. On that level it works brilliantly, but it goes beyond that. Imagine how disquieting it is to find that you share a common viewpoint with a character who has done so many sickening things. I don't ever recall seeing a film which provoked such a reaction in me. But then, twisting conventions and reversing cliches is exactly what Se7en aims to do - even the final credits roll upwards rather than downwards.
0345451325|5.0|This book is one of my favorites. It turned me into a big Halo fan. It is really exciting and very well written. You do not have to be a Halo fan to like this book. Its great for anyone who likes science fiction.
B0001AVZA8|4.0|&quot;Something's Gotta Give&quot;, starring Jack Nicholson and Diane Keaton, is a great comedy release of 2003.  Its plot of a playright whose daughter falls in love with an older man, then later develops a relationship of her own with him, is great.  It has many creative hilarious scenes that keep audiences interested.  It gives new meaning of romance after age fifty.  The other added details, namely the characters' past, gives it the additional unique flavor.  Such interesting chain of events keep audience watching closely, always wondering what will happen next, especially through the numerous surprises.  Though a few scenes are unnecessarily repetative, audiences will never forget this.  Diane Keaton's Golden Globe winning and Oscar nominated performance is outstanding.  Her presence alone gives the film the added viewing pleasure.  Her own sense of drama and humor is clearly pleasant.  Jack Nicholson is outstanding as he always is.  He proves that he plays the best characters the audiences love to hate.  This film is no exception.  All other actors, especially Amanda Peet, Frances McDormand, and Keanu Reeves, also offer quality performance.  &quot;Something's Gotta Give&quot; is a great romantic comedy for all ages to enjoy.  This is sure to please audiences for a long time.
B00012FXAE|5.0|I first saw Aliens on TBS and after watching it i went out and bought the DVD. It is an awesome sci-fi action movie. Sigourney Weaver lights up the screen with her stirring performance as Ripley. I really love the final showdown with the Alien Queen. I first bought the Special Edition but when i saw the 2-disc collector's edition i had to get. I am glad i did because it contains several interesting documentaries on the making of the film. This movie has everything you could want. There are good special effects, great action sequences, great acting and some pretty thrilling moments. This is the definition of a five-star movie
B00000DC4A|3.0|Bryan Adams' &quot;On A Day Like Today&quot; again marked a new chapter in a legendary career.   In the 80s, Bryan did some great work on albums such as &quot;Cuts Like a Knife&quot;, his signature album &quot;Reckless&quot;, his deep album &quot;Into the Fire&quot;, and his commerically successful &quot;Waking Up The Neighbours&quot;.  Following that string of 4 albums, Bryan released &quot;18 Til I Die&quot; which really didn't achieve the glory of those past 4 albums.   His next Studio album was this one and unfortunately, this album keeps Bryan Adams stagnent and makes me wonder if he will ever achieve the heights he had in the 80s.<br />Like &quot;18 Til I Die&quot; this is not a terrible album, but it just doesn't reach the high standards set by Bryan Adams in the past.  Unlike &quot;18 Til I Die&quot; which was an album in which Bryan Adams had a &quot;Mid Life Crisis and Youthful resurgance&quot;, this album goes back toward a more mature Bryan Adams.  I can best describe this as his &quot;Adult Contemporary Album&quot;.   Most of the songs could easily be played on an &quot;Adult Contemporary&quot; or &quot;Mix&quot; station.  A big change on this album is the absence of Robert &quot;Mutt&quot; Lange (Mr Shania Twain).  Lange was a major contributer from a musicianship, songwriting, and production standpoint on the last 2 albums.   Lange was never able to achieve the great songwriting that Bryan had with Jim Vallance in the 80s, but didn't do a bad job.   The replacement for Lange was producer Phil Thornalley.  Thornalley also co-writes some songs with Bryan.  The other main co-writer with Bryan is Gretchen Peters whom Bryan worked with on the &quot;Unplugged&quot; live album.   As for the Adams Band - Mickey Curry, Dave Taylor, and Keith Scott are all back.  Gone is keyboardist Tommy Mandel.<br />So what doesn't help this album reach the bar that Adams has set.   My big feel is that many of the songs lack the personal passion that Bryan brought on all of his albums up until this one.  There are 4 songs (&quot;Before the Night Is Over&quot;, &quot;I Don't Wanna Live Forever&quot;, &quot;When You're Gone&quot;, and &quot;Cmon Cmon Cmon&quot;) on this album that do show the old passion, but for the most part it does lack the personal passion.   Especially the title track &quot;On a Day Like Today&quot; - I thought one of the weakest tracks on the album was picked as the title song.   The song does nothing to stick in my mind.   It is really the four songs I list above which really carry the album as a whole.<br />&quot;Before the Night Is Over&quot; has almost a feel from &quot;Reckless&quot; to it.  It is the strongest song on the album.  Just from the opening chords and lines &quot;Hey Baby&quot;.   If I were the record company and Adams, this would have been the single I released.   &quot;I Don't Wanna Live Forever&quot; quick tempo to it and has some great raspy vocals and harmonies, although it doesn't quite have a feel from &quot;Reckless&quot; (this song really stands more on its own as opposed to comparing to past works.   &quot;Cmon Cmon Cmon&quot; has a very 90s feel to it and it almost reminds me of &quot;Rock On&quot; and kind of reminds me of a much softer and more mature version of Michael Damian's &quot;Rock On&quot;.<br />&quot;When You're Gone&quot; is the most interesting and eye-catching song.  The reason is that Melanie C from the Spice Girls (better known by her Spice Girl persona 'Sporty Spice').  This song starts with almost a retro Beach Boys start.   Don't let the Spice Girls connection shy you away from this song.  Melanie C holds her own in this song and blends her harmonies beautifully with Bryan on this song.   Melanie C basically does background vocals for the entire song and my only complaint is I would have liked to hear her get a little more of a solo (she does get a couple of solo lines).  I give Bryan credit for not being afraid to put a Spice Girl on one of his albums.<br />So Bryan Adams will go the Adult Contemporary Route marking another chapter in what is sure to be a Hall of Fame Career.   This won't be one of his albums that gets him into the Hall of Fame, but it won't prevent him from getting in.
B00005JLH3|5.0|&quot;Drumline&quot; is a sterling example of a movie that works because it follows a winning formula while avoiding cliche. So many movies force their characters to march through the elements of the formula, treating them as nothing more than pawns. But &quot;Drumline&quot; gives us characters with ideas, souls, and intelligence, so that they drive the plot, rather than let the plot drive them. And it even offers a few surprises.<br />Devon (well-played by Nick Cannon) is our hero, and even though he grew up poor in Harlem, he's proud that he lives clean, has fathered no children, and earned his full scholarship to college. He's cocky, but with good reason, as he's the best drummer in school - and he plans to be the best drummer in college, as well.<br />The college scenes, incidentally, are a band geek's dream. We see how band camp is run as sort of a Basic Training Lite, and how there's a hierarchy that has to be followed. But then the movie does an interesting thing - it gives the characters in Devon's life dimensions. Sean, Devon's section leader, isn't a villain but a kid given a tough job who makes bad choices while trying to do the right thing. And the band director, Dr. Lee, is immediately set up as a no-nonsense, pro-education hero - but toward the middle of the movie, we suspect that his point of view might not be the only acceptable one.<br />The formula presses on, and while the film inevitably builds to a big (and kind of awesome) showdown between rival drumlines, there are nifty surprises along the way. It's inevitable that Devon's antics get him suspended from the band, but watch how they happen, and how they defy expectations. And watch how Dr. Lee has to make some difficult decisions and be true to himself, even as he defines what that truth is.<br />There's a reason why we like movies about cocky underdogs with talent. &quot;Drumline&quot; knows this and exploites it to the hilt - and sure enough, we end up with big, goofy smiles on our faces andhearts. And along the way we get to see some great marching bands and a lot of genuine comedy - who can ask for more than that?
0743243315|3.0|After all I had heard about this book, I was greatly looking forward to cracking the spine.  Unfortunately, I was disappointed in it.  It was nicely written in places and I was happy for Nanzeen's final choice but, for the most part, I was ready for the next book by the time I was half way through. <br />The characters had so much potential but remained flat and inanimate throughout.  There were so many times when they could have sprung to life but did not.  The ending seemed a bit false to me - all of a sudden, Nanzeen has the courage to stand up to her husband?  Her image as a meek woman through much of the book did not match up with the woman having an affair with a younger man.  I also think Ali wrapped up that affair too neatly.  Where was the pain, the torment, anything to show that the affair was worth something to either participant?<br />It was a nice read but I much prefer a book that I can immerse myself in at least one angle - the story line, the characters, the setting, anything.  That just did not happen in this book.

B0000AFQS0|5.0|Having seen the movie in the theatre, on VHS and Lasedisc, I expected somewhat more after having read all the raving reviews. The movie itself is great and I do not regret acquiring it. The Who were the greatest group of all time. However the second DVD is quite boring. I do not really find interesting to listen to the people having restored the movie. You should keep the first dvd and throw away the second one, even if there is some nice bonus material. Otherwiise the Who material is fantastic.
B0001GOH6Q|4.0|This movie makes me all warm inside after I watch it. The scene where time stops and he meets Sandra is great. There are other nice scenes and it's a heart warming story of the relationship between a fahter and son. It is great for the entire family.
B0001ENY6M|4.0|Somehow, John Debney, having composed the scores to a good number of films has managed to stay well below the radar of popularity. It may not be a complete accident, then, that one of the all-time top 10 most popular movies, 'The Passion of the Christ' lent itself to catapult his name among the most famous scorers out there now. However, I have a dilemma with this album.<br />It is not difficult to be captivated by the album's beauty. One song after another bring in elements drawn from a blend of soul-touching choirs and straight-up epic musical soundscapes bound to please fans of epics in the league of 'Braveheart' and 'Gladiator' alike. Here's where part of my dilemma begins, then. I love the music, but I can't help think once and again, like other reviewers, that I've heard this before. If the comparisons with James Horner's compositions have you bored, I invite you to play the music to &quot;The Last Temptation of Christ,&quot; by Peter Gabriel, which he captured in his legendary 1989 album 'Passion'. You will be shocked at how similar some of the tracks from Debney's score are to Gabriel's work 15 years ago, in particular where he brings in middle eastern elements to the mix.<br />In sum, since I can't take away from the score's beautiful work, I will give it a high score, which would be five stars under normal circumstances, but given the amount and depth of the similarities between this work and others, I will take a way a full star. Let's leave it at a comfortable four, which will make me feel in peace with my [musical] soul.
B000035Z3K|5.0|Despite the greatness of Murnau's NOSFERATU before it and Guy Maddin's DRACULA: PAGES FROM A VIRGIN'S DIARY after it, Tod Browning's Universal classic (the centerpiece of this cd) remains the standard version of Bram Stoker's tale. In large part this is due to Browning's astonishing sets and the superbly textured deep focus cinematography of Karl Freund. The Castle Dracula, and later the vampuire's stronghold in the UK, Carfax Abbey, are masterfully conveyed with giant sets and superb matte paintings. Bela Lugosi's performance is nothing to compare with, say, Boris Karloff's sensitive rendition of Frankenstein's monster in a nearly contemporary Universal film, but you still will see why it made him a screen legend: he is wonderfully charismatic, and he uses his long hands to spectacular effect. The mise-en-scene is often quite static, but it's the tableaux from this fil one remembers: the brides of the vampire swooping down of Renfield in the castle from the foreground; Renfield (Dwight Frye, in a classic performance) staring up, grinning madly, from the belowdecks of the doomed Vesta; Dracula swooping up Mina (Helen Chandler) in the vertical slash of his cloak in the fogbound grounds of the Seward Asylum. The film provides the option of a beautiful, if incredibly obtrusive, contemporary Philip Glass score since the original film was also without music altogether (which to my mind only enhances its creepiness). There's also the full film of the alternative Spanish-language version filmed on the same sets at night (to save money). Although many cineastes consider the Spanish version actually better than Browning's version, thanks to its enhanced eroticism, greater use of mise-en-scene and greater scene-to-scene continuity, this reviewer felt it crucially lacks the creepier static qualities of the Browning version.
B000060MWU|1.0|DO NOT BUY THIS LOST HIGHWAY IMPORT DVD!  I should have trusted the other reviewer who said that the transfer quality is beyond awful because it is!  Honestly, the quality of this import DVD is as bad as a poor quality bootleg DVD.  There is a small strip on the left side of the picture because the picture isn't centered.  The look of the picture is very poor and grainy.  The sound does not even match up with the picture.  I love this movie, but do yourself a favor and do NOT buy this import DVD.  The VHS version not only looks better than the import DVD, but it is also in widescreen.
B00005JLYW|1.0|The first one was great and set the stage for a modern and upbeat version of the hit show.  The sequel is just sheer crap.  I was very excited to see part 2 after the first film became such a hit, but this just went overboard with the stunts, the storyline, the costumes, the plot and worst of all...the cameos. <br />I love Bernie Mac, but the role of Bosley is not suited for him.  He's better at playing sharper, edgier comedy roles that can really bring out his talent. Bill Murray made a much better Bosley.  The Angels come back looking sexier and more stylish than before but also a whole lot ditzier.  The looks come in and the brains go out.  What happened to all that cerebal knowledge they had mixed in with their lollipop humor like speaking all those languages and creatively using their sexy disguises to get the mission accomplished?  The sexy outfits in this film were just for show.  They served no purpose at all.  <br />And what is with the cameos?  You get everyone from Carrie Fisher and John Cleese to the Olsen twins and Bruce Willis in this thing.  It seems director McG was so busy trying to stuff these favors into this film he forgot there was story going on. They should have stuck to just one surprise guest...Demi Moore who really didn't get to strut her stuff until half way through the movie.  All the reviews and the talk shows spoke of Demi making her hot and furious comeback as the Angel gone bad with the stunning body to prove it.  I felt she was cheated of that opportunity. She could have made her villainess really evil. All that work and working out for a measley few minutes on screen.  She was only good thing about the whole film. <br />The over slow-motion Matrix-like Kung Fu effects were just crappy attempts at fighting.  It's as if the girls never trained.  Then there's the flying and flipping and landing on the stilettos after a fifty foot jump without breaking any heels.  Just over the top.  We really didn't need to know the origins of the Creepy Thin Man.  It was better he remained mysterious.  Then Barrymore's vicious ex-boyfriend came into play.  Just one unnecessary appearance after another.  <br />There was just too much going on in this film.  It's like taking a perfectly good-sized sandwich and stuffing it with too much filling.  Too hard to keep together and too much to bite into. Concentrate on one theme at a time...please.    <br />Too bad.  Could have been a decent flick if they just kept it simple.
B00009TB5G|5.0|These films will be remembered forever as the greatest trilogy besides Star Wars. Every shot in the movie is breathtaking. THe Battle of Helm's Deep is one of the greatest battles ever to be filmed. The only battle more magnificent is the one is The Return of the King. I have watched everything on all 4-discs and i am very pleased i bought this DVD. It was worth every penny. If you ever look at the screen and wonder how they did that the answer is somewhere on the DVD. I also must mention how the sountrack to this film is beautiful.
0385504209|4.0|It is one a.m. You just got into bed a few hours ago.  Suddenly the phone rings, and the hotel worker tells you that someone's on their way to your room.  When the visitor gets to your hotel room, you discover that he is with the police.  But what would they want with you?  You've done nothing wrong.  You're a college teacher for crying out loud!  You teach art and symbolism, and have been writing books on your research.  Jacques Sauniere, the head curator at the Louvre in France, had arranged for you to meet up with him somewhere, but he never showed.  The policeman shows you a picture from a crime scene.  The photo is of a body.  Jacques Sauniere's body.  He then invites you to the Louvre to help with the crime scene.  But helping isn't really what you're there for.  You are being questioned without even knowing it!  The head of the police, Fache, is in charge of this case.  He is determined to find you guilty in order to help support his job, being as he's currently in low esteem with French and American law keepers.  Sophie Neveu , a cryptologist, meets up with you and Fache.  She says she has a message from the U.S. Embassy for you, but when you listen to the message, you find that it is something much more important.  It is up to you, Mr. Robert Langdon, to team up with Sophie Neveu and investigate Jacques Sauniere's death, find the keystone to the Holy Grail, while at the same time protecting the keystone, avoiding arrest by Fache, and keeping the evil Opus Dei from power.<br />\\"The Da Vinci Code\\" by Dan Brown is a wonderfully written book.  It is very relaxing, even in the fast sections.  Although the book takes place in a 24 hour period, it seems to be much longer.  Mr. Brown has a great knowledge of symbolism and history.  As the little reviews on the flaps of the book say, the book is \\"pure genius!\\"  Most of the clues in the story revolve around Leonardo Da Vinci, thus the name \\"The Da Vinci Code.\\"  In the book, the murdered curator Jacques Sauniere was part of a group called \\"The Priory of Sion,\\" or P.S.  The group is revolved around the \\"sacred feminine,\\" worship female goddesses of fertility, and are the keepers of the Holy Grail.  Opus Dei is one of the groups after the Holy Grail.  Bishop Aringarosa is in charge of Opus Dei, and has been trying to get his hands on the Holy Grail in order to use it to boost his power.  His assistant, Silas, does all the dirty work. ...  This book refers to a lot of history and paintings, along with the Bible; although a lot of it is made up.  Don't take it seriously, it's just amusing.

B00003CXI1|3.0|Harry Potter is an orphan who was adopted by his maternal aunt and who is unhappy at home. Then a giant shows up to take him away to a new school and promised happiness (the daydreams of many young teenagers?). This film shows 'Warthogs' as another English Public School, but one that trains wizards instead of future civil servants and management (a parody?). The special effects used here are more advanced than &quot;Jurassic Park&quot;. Would this work be successful without these tricks? Do children benefit from this fantasy or other ersatz fairy tales? Are they a juvenile version of Romance novels?<br />The teacher of &quot;Potions&quot; promises the skill of changing people's minds. Is this a parody of Advertising or Public Relations? The Flying lesson shows interpersonality conflicts, and how disobedience creates a problem for one student. The appearance of the threatening troll creates a diversion (a symbol for &quot;townies&quot;?). The special effects are best in the game of quiddich, much better than in the much older &quot;Star Wars&quot;. Harry captures the gold flying ball and wins the game. [Was the fix in?] The Cloak of Invisibility reminds me of &quot;The Invisible Man&quot; (which warned against experimenting with drugs). There is a magic mirror which shows people what they want; the old white-bearded wizard correctly warns against indulging in fantasy! When Harry is threatened in the Dark Forest, a centaur shows up to save him, and warns him to stay away (certain places are not safe for teenagers even if they have magic powers). Harry and his friends learn of a plot to steal the Sorcerer's Stone! This can change lead into gold, and give eternal life (not the same thing as eternal youth!).<br />The chess game with life-size figures is another diversion. Finally the real villain is found; Harry discovers you can't judge by appearances. The villain is killed by the unsuspected magic of Harry. The story ends with Harry celebrating with his friends, an obligatory happy ending for commercially successful films. [Why do the students wear dunce caps?] But what happens after they graduate? I haven't seen too many want-ads for &quot;Wizards&quot;; were these jobs all out-sourced to Romanian? There isn't much of a plot, just loosely connected scenes. But I shouldn't have told you that.
0060512806|4.0|The story is really good. The only problem i found was the chapters that deal with numbers. I found myself skiping 20 pages at one time. Other than that it was a good read.
B00009TB5G|5.0|Lord of the Rings is by far my favorite movie.  I can't really like the movies separately as they are all part of one story. So they are all equally special.  The books were brilliant and the movie brought its magic and heroism to life.  Peter Jackson mastered the most complex story ever told into the span of three films.  While a great task, I am somewhat envious. If I could turn back time and work on a movie set, Lord of the Rings would definitely be it. <br />To the reviewer, Daniel Udell from Pennsylvania on the review &quot;Bored of the Rings&quot;.  I thought your review was hilarious even though I completely disagree with you on the ratings.  I suppose films like these seems to ring true for those of us who are most in touch with our inner child and imagination. You can expect nothing less.<br />But to each their own.  Hail Peter Jackson for his masterpiece that will forever be a cinema classic for many generations.
B000002GA8|5.0|I first heard this on vinyl as a young teen, when my father brought it home.  At that time, and for the first time, music actually built stone cathedrals, and oceans, entire scenes in my mind.  Better than any movie ever could, and more so than the books I so much love.  I just purchased the disc, to share with my new wife, and her son.  The looks on thier faces as the similar scenes developed in thier minds eye... pure magic.  Rick Wakeman prooves to be not only the integral part of Yes' best years, but a true magician/painter.  Every parent should share this with thier children, to show what TV lacks.  Every audiophile should keep a pristine copy for when escape is needed most.
B000009ED0|5.0|This is Kid Rock at his best! I love this album. The whole album is bad ass.If you don't have this album PICK IT UP! i guarentee you won't be dissapointed. from his opening &quot; MY NAME IS KIIIIIIIIIIIID ROCK!!!&quot; of &quot; Bawitdaba&quot; to his LAST cut &quot;I AM THE BULLGOD&quot; ( the remix version, NOT #4, the orginal one) is KICK ASS!!!
B0001Z53AQ|4.0|D12 World. (4.5, not 4, won't let me put 4.5)<br />Git Up- Great song, one of my favorites. Eminem starts with a great, long verse where he barely takes a breathe. Not a good sing-a-long with, you'll get lost fast. (4.5/ 5)<br />Loyalty- Another good one. With Obie Trice. Sounds a lot like Git Up, but thats good. Obie gives a good verse, but I don't really think he blew anything away. (4/ 5)<br />Just Like U- Just good. Bizzare alone. A lot of people don't like Bizzare, and although he's not the fastest (no where near actually), but his stuff can be funny, disturbing, and refreshing. The chorus is sort of haunting, children deliver it. (3/5)<br />I'll Be Damned- Don't really like it, I skip past this. (2.5/5)<br />Dude (skit)<br />My Band- Everyone's heard this before, and can be very funny, but is played a lot. Could have picked a better first single.Of course, without the video, you really don't get what's going on in the song.<BR>(4/5)<br />U R The One- Ok, nothing that leaps out at you though. (2.5/5)<br />6 In The Morning- Good song, Em shines. One of the best (my favorite) on the album. From Em's Straight From The Lab LP (one of Em's put-together-on-the-web albums), used to be Come On In. (4.5/5)<br />How Come- Great song. Deep. About Royce, who used to be their friend. Somepeople said this was about Kim, but if you listen, why would Proof and Kon Artis rap about Kim? (4.5/5)<br />Leave Dat Boy Alone- Good. Em's southern accent gets annoying though. (4/5)<br />Get My Gun- Another good one. (4/5)<br />Bizzare (skit)<br />B I T C H- Like Devil's Night \\"Pimp Like Me\\". Ok, not as good as Pimp.. though. (3/5)<br />Steve's Cofee House (skit)<br />D-12 World-  Beat is good, lyrics are ok, but the chorus is sooo stupid. The chorus is so not to their standards, anyone could have come up with it. Its supposedwas one of their funny songs, but they got a little lazy (2.5/5)<br />40 Oz- Great song, one of the 3 best. D-12 World's version of Devil Night's Fight Music. Em and Proof in particular are good on it. (5/5)<br />Commercial Break- Good rapping from Young Zee, getting tired of that DJ though. Skit.<br />American Psycho II- Featuring B-Real. Good rapping. Em and Bizzare are good, Bizzare was born for these kind of songs. (3.5/5)<br />Bugz 97- Great freestyle from Bugz. (RIP), he was very good, its too bad he can't be rapping today.<br />Good Die Young- Contender for best song. Tribute to Bugz. Perfect lyrics, will put a lump in your throat.<BR>(5/5)<br />Keep Talkin- Good song. Good way to finish up, with a last threat to anyone who badmouths the group.<BR>(4/5)<br />Slightly better than Devil's Night. More organized. <BR>Best members, in order: Em (of course), Proof (his style is just great), Kon Artist (great producer), Swift, Kuniva, Bizzare.

B00003CXZ1|4.0|I've never played the Tomb Raider games so I haven't a clue of what Lara Croft is really supposed to be like except she's a chick with big guns and other features. Let's face it.  Despite the somewhat simplistic and rushed plot, people love adventure movies with danger, excitement and cool stunts, especially when girls are in it.<br />And I personally like Jolie's rendition of Croft.  She's sexy yet sensual.  Athletic yet Composed. Wryly coy at times, and to top it off...she's English.  With the looks, lips and soft English accent, Jolie creates a very attractive Lara Croft with adventurous elegance and style...and it certainly helps that she's filthy rich.  Comes in handy when supporting her expensive hobby.<br />I thought this was an enjoyable film despite the weak plot.  Definitely worth the viewing.
B0000959N0|5.0|It's too bad comic book movies aren't supposed to be &quot;cheesy&quot;. Some folks don't understand the fun of a good cheesy comic adventure. The Punisher is dark and cheesy too. Heck, Daredevil was ultra-cheesy in the Trial of the Incredible Hulk. Now he's not as cheesy, but some folks want to complain that it's still not right. Was it cheesy when Matt lost his father? No way. This movie has heart too. I suppose a guy named Doctor Octopus isn't cheesy? Whatever! People are going to believe what ever they want, but they should lighten up and stop being way too serious and stuffy. This is a fine escapist movie.

B0000640VO|5.0|Amelie is a song to the life. In many aspects this film reperesents what Jupiter (Symphonie 41) of Wolfang Amadeus Mozart means in the music; the supreme freedom.<br />Not only it's a oda to the savoir vivre , (it's a free film) but instead it has a deep sense of no matter what; keep going and go ahead, that sooner or later you win.<br />It's literally impossible not fall in love with Audrey Tatou. Her beauty, charm, shyness,charisma and sympathy let you amazing.<br />One overwhelming script; written with a fertile imagination , it contains a lot of delightful situations and enjoyable moments. I've seen at least ten times from 2001, and it shines by itself like a diamond; it has too,  a lot of countless virtues, the prodigious camera makes lovely travellings, fluid dolly, and the photograph is unique.<br />Besides you have other depicted characters that support the story and never let you down.<br />A film made and surrounded by a supreme good taste; more you can expect and much more.<br />Haven't you watched it? and what are you waiting for?<br />A must for you.<br />This film didn't win the Oscar. But this eternal mistake will never make this movie grows and grows with the time the supreme judge, and becomes from 2001 a true modern classic.
B0001FR3IQ|3.0|Director Mathieu Kassovitz pours on the atmosphere (literally) in this sci-fi thriller set in a dreadfully gloomy mental institution that needs a serious makeover.  It seems to never stop raining or lightning - ever!  It's dark and scary and the lights are always on the kaput.  Can't someone change those light bulbs!  Won't somebody check those darn circuit breakers?  Halle Berry acts herself crazy (again, literally), but hey, Halle, lay off that Botox if you want some more facial expressions!  Halle sees a beaten woman driving home one (stormy) night and crashes into a tree.  She wakes up in the same hospital as a patient and a criminal for killing her husband (her boss).  Is she really crazy or is this a plot?  Did some coworker inject her with mind-altering drugs?  Why is Robert Downing, Jr. playing a smaller role here?  Why is he speaking with that weird accent?  Did Halle imagine that girl on the road?  Oops! - remember \\"What Lies Beneath?  I think it's the same girl!  The rest of the film is a run and chase sequence where Halle discovers who is really dead and who should be.  There are also some really disgusting revelations as to what happened to some missing people and it's all gleefully recorded on film!  Remember the movie, \\"8MM\\"?  Eeewww!  There is somewhat of a happy ending (if only because it finally stops raining!), but then Halle sees another child in a dangerous situation - or is it a ghost?  Or, is it Haley Joel Osment?  Is she seeing `dead people' too?  Why do their first names sound the same?  Is that part of the plot too?  Remember \\"The Sixth Sense\\"?  Remember every other horror movie cliche from the last ten years?  What in God's name is happening here???
B0000024JN|5.0|The Beastie Boys LICENSED TO ILL is obnoxious, loud, brash, and STOOOOOPIT! Thank God! These were the qualities that made it both a great rap album and a great headbanging album! When I heard the opening drumbeat--lifted from Zep's \\"Moby Dick\\"--I knew these local boys (2 from Brooklyn, 1 from Manhattan) had it right! This album is the Id run wild! (I can't stop using exclamation points!) <br />Initially, the album was wrongly perceived as a showcase for \\"Fight for your right\\". It was equally wrong to claim that the album was an exploitation of black music by four Jewish kids. People forget: imitation is the highest form of flattery. The Beastie Boys obviously respected and admired the burgeoning hiphop sound and wanted to be a part of it. They loved it. <br />LICENSED TO ILL was really a forum for these three guys and producer Rick Ruben to wake America up from its spandex, hair-metal doldrums and acknowledge that rap could be as powerful as rock. The hybrid produced amazing results like \\"She's Crafty\\", \\"It's Time to Get Ill\\", \\"No Sleep til Brooklyn\\" and \\"Rhymin' and Stealin\\". This was as much a breakthrough album as (dare I say it?) Sgt. Pepper's Lonely Hearts Club Band. And nearly twenty years later, it's finding a new audience with younger listeners. That's innovation. That's inspiration. That is the power of fun!
B0001HAHXW|5.0|Clapton has always excelled at the Blues, and shown a preference for the genre. The liner notes of &quot;Me &amp; Mr. Johnson&quot; explain why.

0767802470|5.0|Wolfang Petersen may be proud for all the eternity by this achievement. This film (just ten millions dollars in 1981)is a superb film.<br />You know so well when you're in front a masterpiece. That sensation which remains in your mind and your soul , a must reference and above all, it becomes an unforgettable memory in your brain.<br />The film is full of tension; claustrophobic, dramatic and powerfully haunting. The sequences of action are very well made; the script is very related to the book.The cast is outstanding. The handle of camera is BREATHTAKING, the camera is a sliding eye, nervous, it retains the anguish, the hopeless and that deathly taste you feel when you share the destiny of these man under that huge water pressure.<br />That film broke the walls of the standard market and soon became from 1982 in a classic film.<br />The question about if this film is anti war film is out of discussion. I don't think even if this issue is important. You must feel the evil experience of these men sent to a almost safe death in a sea surrounded by enemies forces.<br />Watch this movie.<br />And you'll understand why U-571 even his special effects is just a worthy tribute to Das Boot, the masterpiece of Wolfang Petersen.
B00005JLZN|5.0|When I decided to view this movie I didn't know what it was about, no idea.<br />As the movie progressed I was so engrossed with what was going on and what was the plot. I was so shocked as to what happened in the movie and the roles that everyone played. People that you though meant nothing in the movie were some key players. The theme of the movie centers around the death penalty and how far people will go to let the goverment know that it is not fair.<br />Watch it, you will not be disappointed!!!!<br />Later

B0000AQVCL|5.0|I was a little worried when I got this CD because I figured it would be like every other CD and band where you hear a song that you really like, but the rest of the CD was crap.  When I listened to the entire CD I realized how wrong I was.  I like a majority of all the songs on here.  It is a CD that you can listen to at anytime and still love it.  The more I listened to it, the more I noticed that I liked the CD even more.  If you like just one song on the CD, you will love the rest.  It has become my favorite CD and that has a song for any kind of mood you are in.

The film is made of histamine, still is haunting and unforgettable.<br />A solid script, an adequate sense of realism , and a worthy cast gives a full circle for this movie; the Cinderella film in the nominated ; but let's wait for some years and you will realize how this film will grow over the winner film of this year , because its internal message is eternal.<br />Chris Cooper steals the show by his amazing performance as the whisperer horse.<br />A winner film that it will never let you down.
B00006879E|5.0|After hearing the first single from the album, &quot;This Love,&quot; I was intrigued.  The song was unlike anything playing on the airwaves.  I decided to buy the CD even though it hadn't satisfied my usual criteria of at least three songs released to the radio, and my liking them.  I was not disappointed.<br />The influences of Motown and Stevie Wonder are evident, but Maroon 5 lends its own spin to that genre with the sublime vocals of Adam Levine.  A truly unique voice among all of those boy bands' postpubescent tenors, Mr. Levine's is aptly suited for this type of music.  With a little more edge than Stevie Wonder's, it is nonetheless effective on such moving songs as &quot;She Will Be Loved&quot; and &quot;Sweetest Goodbye.'<br />I highly recommend this album for Levine's voice, but the rest of the band's talent and ability to groove is also a good reason to obtain it.  Songs About Jane rocks.
B000031EGV|2.0|Jumanji has its moments, but you might as well tape it off cable. Robin Williams is probably embarrassed about this film, although it's not entirely his fault. The film drags, the characters are stick figures. Almost dreadful.
B0000AQVCL|5.0|I was a little worried when I got this CD because I figured it would be like every other CD and band where you hear a song that you really like, but the rest of the CD was crap.  When I listened to the entire CD I realized how wrong I was.  I like a majority of all the songs on here.  It is a CD that you can listen to at anytime and still love it.  The more I listened to it, the more I noticed that I liked the CD even more.  If you like just one song on the CD, you will love the rest.  It has become my favorite CD and that has a song for any kind of mood you are in.
B00004Z459|5.0|Great record, great emotion, who cares what anybody else says. I am a big fan of real rock music such as Tool, Dimmu Borgir, Black Sabbath, Pink Floyd etc. And I can still appreciate great angry rock such as this
B00008CLOA|5.0|This is the greatest Pink Floyd album out there. The Wall is a pretty close second. Like all of Pink Floyd's music, you don't have to be on acid to truly appreciate it, but it doesn't hurt. The songs on this album combine amazing musical skill with incredible vocals. A must have for any Floyd fan, and definately worth picking up for the casual listener.<br />In addition, ignore Pogo's review. He implies that Floyd will not be around forever, yet Britney Spears and Madonna will. This would be a valid point, except for the fact that he states it on a review for the bands 30th anniversary edition album. For those that cannot make the connection, that means that Floyd is still around after 30 years. In 30 years, we'll see who remembers little Ms. Spears.
B00005OM4Q|5.0|Oh my God. <br />This movie is so good. Everything about Almost Famous is perfect. The direction, acting, writing. Everything. Watch this and you'll never know how you got along without it.
B0000AGWJ7|3.0|First of all when I first got this cd I liked it a lot but it soon grew very tiresome. Don't believe all the people saying that is all metal and stuff, becuase it isn't. A lot sounds emo-ish and the vocals aren't that heavy. And I agree with somebody in that Avenged Sevenfold should not be put in the same catagory with other bands such as As I Lay Dying and Killswitch Engage because those 2 bands which I just mentioned are actually metal unlike Avenged Sevenfold which is more hardcore punk. Overall I enjoyed it at first but now I am sadly tired of it. Pick it up if you aren't into heavy types of metal because you will be disappointed.
B00003CXCT|5.0|I agree that some people are making too much of the special edition thing.  Lots of movies are remastered to improve picture quality.  Ewoks ruined Return anyway, so what's the big deal about a few minutes of extra CGI.  Does anyone really know the total time of the added scenes?  Some of the effects were good, some bad (Greedo), but to have the DVD with 5.1 or more surround sound is awesome.  I can't wait to hear the effects for home theater!  Digital audio will blow away the original VHS Dolby PL2.  I'll buy these now, I can always sell them later on Ebay if the originals come out.
B000060P79|1.0|This cd is gay. The song refering to christmas sounds like a barney <BR>song. It is entirely pointless and kidish. The songs are so goody goody. The singer sounds like he is 13.
B000002AZ8|4.0|First off, I only give 5 stars for a select few albums, so don't be fooled by my 4 star rating. This album took Pearl Jam into a completely different direction, and thank goodness. Although Ten, and to a greater extent VS. are great albums, they would have been wearing thin creatively had they tried to hold to the grunge style that dominates those two albums. &quot;Nothingman&quot; is a beautiful, balladesque piece that works better than anything similar they'd attempted before. Straight ahead rockers like &quot;Spin the Black Circle&quot; and &quot;Whipping&quot; are more fresh and lively than anything in their previous work. &quot;Corduroy&quot; and &quot;Better Man&quot; are songs of epic proportions that add nice dynamics to the mix. All the other tracks add in some way or another, and add to create possibly the darkest, rockiest, and musically solid album they've yet to create (although No Code is more diverse and experimental and also quite excellent). A far better album than most people give them credit for.
B000050XEI|5.0|I've read reviews saying &quot;This is the most boring music out there&quot; and critizing the New Age music. Let me inform you that maybe 8 out of 10 people who said that are probably teens going through the death/black/goth phase. The thing about New Age? It's inspiring (I'm sure Black Sabbath is *sarcasm). It's beautiful and it takes talent (talking fast in a microphone or groaning is not talent). And it has a way of relaxing you, and even making you feel like you're in a cloud. Enya is no less different. Her purpose is not to get you angry. Her songs are insipiring and beautiful, just like her voice. This CD is great and I especially love &quot;Deora ar mo chlo&quot; and &quot;Flora's Secret&quot; and &quot;Only time&quot;. This music is great, and if you want to forget about stresses and preassures, hear this CD for a while.
0140288503|5.0|What a fascinating and gripping account of modern urban combat!  Bowden has written an excellent narrative of the ferocious events in Mogadishu on 3-4 October 1993.  I would reccommend this book to any student of history, political science, or military studies--especially soldiers in need of an understanding of how, when even minute mistakes are made in planning, terrible things can happen to deter a unit's mission.  One crticism is that Bowden should have shied from the political critique in his Epilogue.  Since his book focused on the Rangers' and D-boys' combat experience, that's what he should have discussed.  It seems that the political implications leading to US / UN involvement in Somalia were an afterthought and Bowden does a much better job focusing on the stories of  the individuals involved.  Overall, however, this is a great read and a fascinating testament to the courage, bravery, and devotion to each other shown by those who participated in the terrible Bakara Market Battle.
B000003TA4|5.0|This album started it all, folks (actually, Bleach did-but-oh well)!  This album made &quot;grunge&quot; big.  Although, in my opinion, grunge never existed.  Anyway, &quot;Smells Like Teen Spirit&quot; was the anthem of Gen X and songs like &quot;Lithium&quot; and &quot;Come As You Are&quot; and &quot;In Bloom&quot; and &quot;Territorial Pissings&quot; helped revolutionize &quot;Grunge&quot; and Gen X. Although this album eventually led to Avril Lavigne, Good Charlotte, Limp Bizkit, Hoobastank, Nickelback, and even Britney Spears getting big-it was good at the time.  This album helped rock music be good for almost a decade.
B0001HAISG|5.0|I realllly enjoyed this movie! I thought at first it was some kind of movie that is too cheesy and babyish to me...but its sooo not like that at all! This movie shows the real story of Peter Pan besides the old cartoon version. I know really much like this version than the cartoon one. This movie makes scense for the things that happen. Every scene I was enthralled with the great acting and stunning special effects. Peter Pan, Wendy, and Captain Hook played very well and they draw you into this magical place that makes you wish after watching the film never to grow up! In the DVD I really loved the special features too. This is a great movie with nothing horrible to say to it! It's perfect!!
B0000035E7|4.0|This album-although not many people own it-is very good.  It features songs like &quot;Downer&quot;, &quot;Negative Creep&quot;, &quot;Floyd The Barber&quot;, and &quot;Blew&quot;.  For now- Screw Nevermind!  Screw In Utero!  Just listen to this-it's very good, but don't try to campare it with Nevermind or In Utero.  If you like it, you'll probaly also like Incesticide.
B0000AQS0F|5.0|If you like action packed shoot-em ups, go play DOOM. <br />If you like intelligent, thoughtful, intense situations played out by bigger-than-life characters, this is for you.<br />What's the appeal? I don't know. Maybe that the shows hooker has a deep sense of morality. Maybe that the ships captain (a smuggler) has an unyielding sense of loyalty to his rag-tag crew. Maybe that even the 'in it for myself' mercenary begins to grow a heart.<br />Maybe all of the above. Maybe we just want to see people, from all walks of life, while far from perfect, live by a code of ethics that is somehow missing from television today.<br />Maybe it's our way of saying, we ARE good people. We're all different, but we're good. Deep down inside. Maybe this show reminds us of how good we really are, and despite our differences; despite our weaknesses; we have the capacity to be honorable.<br />I guess it goes to show, that if Television Execs had the authority, they'd probably cancel us, too.<br />An amazing look at decency....told from the eyes of those you'd least expect to find it.
B00005UKKF|2.0|Ok, Is she a singer or what? &quot;Live From Las Vegas&quot; should be renamed &quot;Lip-Sync From Las Vegas&quot;. This is a Concert, a MUSICAL, therefore you should be singing. I gave 2 stars because I have to admit it, she's hot all wet and there were a few FEW good acts... 3 is many.
B0001WTUH6|5.0|First off, this movie is AMAZING!!!!!  I bought it the day it came out without ever seeing it first.  The lure of vampires and werewolves got me and this movie is all about it!!  Its probably one of my favorite DVDs that i have right now in my collection.  It has what i call a high \\"replay\\" factor, thats where you can watch it numerous times and not get bored with it!  Although i DO have to agree with another person that reviewed this newer \\"unrated/extended cut\\" edition.  I HAAATE when they do this to us (the movie lovers).  Although ill probably \\"whore-out\\" and buy this version also. I still think that it is unfair for the company to hold off on \\"extras\\" of a movie to be re-released at a later date.  That is totally unfair to us the consumers and proves how much money is the almighty ruler to them!!!  I say that the people who bought this dvd should be able to \\"trade it in\\" for the newer version or at least get an extra discount when purchasing this newer version. that would be fair to me, i think.  like maybe 2 buxx or something.  but other than that.  Either version of this movie is worth the money to own in your DVD collection.
B000003CUJ|3.0|Whatever Wagner may have claimed, his greatest accomplishment is as a musician who was an incredible master of the orchestra.  This CD essentially stitches together about 20 excerpts from the Ring Cycle, including the six or seven set pieces (such as Ride of the Valkyries) that you hear in somewhat longer versions on most collections of the Ring's \\"greatest hits\\"  that some call the \\"bleeding chunks\\" of the score.  Maazel has made a good selection of pieces and sometimes the stitching is very smooth (e.g., fire music in Walkure to Mime's music in Act I of Siegfried), though other times the transitions are clunky, in that there is no effort to give each piece the sort of ending it might have if presented as an orchestral piece on its own.<br />The end result doesn't quite hold together, even though the playing is very good and the sound quality terrific.  You feel like you are hearing some great pieces of music with some snippets dropping in to fill in the time -- a little like switching between recordings of two different Beethoven symphonies -- great music but not quite designed to be joined this way.<br />Unless someone is totally allergic to voices, I really would suggest getting familiar with the Ring through the big set pieces and then taking the plunge and trying the operas themselves.  A good bridge is Deryck Cooke's musical analysis of the Ring that nicely lays out the work's themes and shows how they develop and tie together.  This CD is a lot of fun, but there is even more treasure to be found in the full Ring.
1401300901|5.0|How can an only 22 years old woman write such a fabulous novel? I don`t know...but I love every single page of this book.<br />This book is written in a wonderful simply language but touches every heart in a very special way.<BR>I never thought it is possible to write a novel like this ( with an issue that is not taken from all day life)by such a young woman. I always thought, there has to be muchg more experiences in life to make the this story reliable. Ahern describes the feelings of the figures with an suprising accurateness, the reader allmost can feel with them.<BR>To cut a long story short: This book is a MUST for every woman in every age!!! <BR>P.S the author is the daughter of the irish prime minister
B00005Q3KC|4.0|I'm not a big fan of &quot;Best Of&quot; albums from a band that only has a few studio albums. It seems like a waste of money to me. Although the album is great and has some great music, some of the songs are trimmed from what they were originally! Unless you are a huge fan, you probably won't notice, but if you do it will be very disappointing!<BR>The songs are all great and the album is a good combination of classics. A must buy for any &quot;Instant Fan.&quot; For those who are long time fans, you will buy it anyway, so it really doesn't matter. There is also a new song on this album that is great. That is reason enough to get it.
B0001BKAEY|2.0|The first in this series was definitely the best.  Of all I think the second was the worst, but it is a close running between the third and second.  I would have definitely enjoyed more scenes from within the matrix and that added on with the weak and obvious story line made this one just kind of a bore for me.
B000022TSH|5.0|If it wasnt for Noah Cross, the San Fernando Valley would be farming areas versus what it is today, a large metropolitan area of L.A. &quot;you can bring L.A. to the water&quot; he says to Jake Gittes, and that is the centerpiece of &quot;Chinatown&quot; starring Jack Nicholson and directed by Roman Polanski. Probably the last great film noir movie in my opinion, its also a faboulous mystery and detective story. The film takes place in 1930s L.A. where water is a premium and a drought is taken its toll on the city. Private-eye J.J. Gittes, a matrimonial gumshoe is hired by the wife of the head of water and power to see if he is having an affair. All is not how it seems and Gittes is thrown into one big political mess filled with lies, scandal, a murder and incest. This film is a timely classic that will leave you wanting to see it over and over again.
B00005JMEW|4.0|I really enjoyed this movie and cannot wait to see the second volume.  This was a great buildup of the characters in a style that can probably only be pulled off by Tarentino.  Defintely my second favorite Tarentino film behind PUlp Fiction.
B000002NHN|5.0|Thanks for the shamefully-amusing tidbit on the funnily-ironic boating incident. Life imitates art and vice-versa. Anyway, about a McKennitt song I heard on a TV ad for the 1997 version of Cinderella: &quot;Mummer's Dance&quot; is utterly gorgeous. Yes, it's a bit overly-dramatic, but I can't help but love it. It's simply beautiful. I hope the rest Book of Secrets is as good as that song.
B0001GOH6Q|4.0|I really enjoyed this movie, although being from Alabama the accents were definitely over done.  The movie is entertaining from start to finish and was easy to watch.  Tim Burton did a great job with this movie and made it a fun film to watch.
1400031362|4.0|As the third in the No. 1 Ladies Detective series, &quot;Morality for Beautiful Girls,&quot; continues along the same line as the first two books.<br />Precious Ramotswe finds herself involved in a case for a &quot;government&quot; man and spends most of the book away from those that she adores. Mr. J.L.B. Matekoni leaves his repair shop for a stint at the orphange to cure his depression. Mma Ramotswe's assistant is promoted to Asst. Mgr of the repair shop and takes on a case for the detective agency that leads her to discover the truth about beauty. All wrapped up at the end another moral lesson is learned from these wonderful characters.<br />Alexander McCall Smith remains true to his original character concepts and deepens the readers understanding as to what makes them tick. He tells us another fable with a good moral to live by and leads us onto the next in the series. These books are easy, fun reads that blend light mystery with good judgement and relate an excellent lesson. I am looking forward to the next journey of Mma Ramotswe and her gang.

0060955775|5.0|I was wondering whether to read &quot;11 Minutes&quot; by Paulo Coelho, but now I definitely will!

As Madeleine Murray O'Hare strenthened my faith by her hateful atheism, so have the bad reviewers caused me to resolve to read more Paulo Coelho!
6305537321|4.0|\\"Seinfield\\" has ruined me. So many little things pop up in life that remind me of certain episodes and this movie is one of them. Goofball George joins a book club to read Capote's Breakfast at Tiffany's which is a slim volume easily read within a snap, but George, naturally, must cheat and watch the video instead. The movie is quite different from the book, as George discovers to his dismay. I adore both but as entities separate from one another.<br />The movie is a frothy little concoction of romance, kooky characters, and a sparkly clean New York City. A veil of misty eyed yearning and gentle sweetness belie the sordid underbelly of prostitution, organized crime, and other illegal activities but the movie does not dig that deep. It is a fashionable fairytale, after all, and to enjoy the film that is the best way to approach it.<br />Miss Holly Golightly is a charming flit-about who accepts $50 from her gentlemen \\"friends\\" for the powder room then ditches them. Her new neighbor, whom she calls Fred because he reminds her of her beloved brother, is a jaded dried-up writer kept by an older wealthy woman. Holly also earns money by delivering &quot;weather reports&quot; for a jailed mobster. She is amazingly oblivious to what is really going on but she looks so marvelously fab in sleek black dresses and UFO sized hats that one simply cannot hold it against her.<br />A tender poignancy is what saves this movie. I reached for the tissues over the character's frustrations and desperate longings to escape from lives in which they felt trapped. I also found the confusion of Holly's sweet and simple old hubby tapping on my little ole' heart when he shows up in New York to take his young bride back home where he feels she belongs.<br />I enjoy this movie for what it is and not what it could've been. Still, I gladly could do without the Mickey Rooney character - a slimy and oh so unfunny fake-Japanese photographer - but he is a minor character (why did they bother with him at all?) and thankfully is not seen much.<br />See the movie, read the book, but don't become flabbergasted like George Constanza to discover that one is a moon river serenade while the other is a smoky torch song.all?) and thankfully is not seen much.<br />See the movie, read the book, but don't become flabbergasted like George Constanza to discover that one is a moon river serenade while the other is a smoky torch song.
0920668372|5.0|This book is a realistic and child-appropriate portrait of the very natural process of life and growing older, and the bond between parent and child. Ultimately, it is a tear-jerker for adults and incredibly touching for kids.  Kids are able to see that no matter how old they get, no matter how far away they move,  they will always be cherished and loved by parents.  The cute, little repititive rhyme on every other page is especially appealing to children.
B00005JMFQ|2.0|I'm not sure why so many people seemed to like this film. It's a romantic comedy.  So either the romance should be good or the comedy or both.  As to romance, I'm not spoiling anything by saying that there is not a single case in this sprawling ensemble plot of one person falling in love with another:  all we get is love at first sight in every case.  It reminded me a lot of that John Cusack and Kate Beckinsale vehicle &quot;Serendipity&quot; where we're just asked to accept the love at first sight premise.  Closer to genre, it's like &quot;Notting Hill&quot; where Roberts and Grant supposedly fall in love right away.  I didn't buy it there:  if you did, you'd probably like this movie.  As to laughs, I really wonder if anyone who praised this movie ever laughed out loud.  I did:  once.  In a shot straight out of the commercial for the movie, three little girls ask Hugh Grant to sing and when he does, they all dance around as only toddler girls can.  It lasts two seconds.  I laughed.  That was the only time.<br />Not only does the film lack laughs, it tries to be the brilliant and singular &quot;About a Boy&quot; way too often.  From the whole plot line of the guy writing a terrible Christmas song that goes number 1, to the Liam Neeson plot which culminates in his son playing an instrument on stage at the school play in order to impress the cool girl he likes, to the jokes about death.  But &quot;About a Boy&quot; was a genuine satire with hints of genius:  not a bunch of one liners.  To give you an idea of the jokes, the movie begins with clawing happy heart-warming music as Liam Neeson convincingly weeps over his wife's death and calls Emma Thompson for support.  &quot;I didn't know who else to call.&quot;  Thompson replies -- in a humorless performance in a role for which she was horribly miscast-- that she'll call him back sometime because she has to go.  She turns to her little daughter and carries on a &quot;funny&quot; conversation about how her daughter is to play a &quot;lobster&quot; in the school's nativity play.  &quot;I didn't know lobsters were at the nativity!&quot;  Would you laugh?  Finally, a few scenes later, she stops by to see how Neeson is doing.  Again, convincingly, he breaks down crying and sobbing, to which she replies, &quot;Cut it out.  Nobody likes a sissy.&quot;  Look:  I laughed uproariously during the suicide jokes in &quot;About a Boy&quot; but here it's played for laughs, and it's just not funny.<br />If you really haven't seen the movie, then my best advice is that if you loved &quot;Notting Hill,&quot; then you'll enjoy this movie, but if you liked &quot;About a Boy&quot; and didn't like &quot;Notting Hill,&quot; you'll find this one a stinker.play a &quot;lobster&quot; in the school's nativity play.  &quot;I didn't know lobsters were at the nativity!&quot;  Would you laugh?

0803729227|5.0|This is the best book my daughter and I have read in a while.  She is 4, and I have been reading it to her every day since we got it.  We liked it so much that we had to check out all of the other Julia Donaldson books.  We also love Room on the Broom. Both of these are fun rhyming books that tell a wonderful story.
B0000TB01Y|5.0|Wicked is definitely not a masterpiece of musicaal theatre. It's a really fun show, however, with some great hummable pop tunes that will have you humming in the car and in the shower. The score serves well to showcase the strengths of two UBER-DIVAS- Idina Menzel and Kristen Chenoweth. Both are just absolutely amazing in it- Kristen with her near-operatic lyric soprano and Idina Menzel with her rock-tinged belt. This is a must-buy for all Broadway diva lovers.
B00005JLK1|4.0|If you saw Deep Rising, 13 Ghosts, or House on Haunted Hill and liked them, you'll love this movie.  Intended as a Halloween bit of fun, this film, inspite of nearly comical flaws, works!  Comical flaws?  You get to see the same clip of the character Grier saying &quot;Where you going? twice. In the cabin of one of the ghost a hat changes position 3 times, twice in the same scene.<BR>More fun is the opening number Senza Fine which, judging by the posing of the busty singer, must be Italian for &quot;Get a Load of These&quot; (you'll get that when you watch it)<BR>Some obvious problems with the film include:&quot;Dodge&quot; enunciates like a community theater judge, &quot;Munder&quot;  is accent is alterantely British and American, and &quot;Murphy&quot; went on about how he'd been at sea a long time, how the sea does strange things, how the sea gives you an opportunity, blah blah blah. <BR>Didn't I say I liked this film?  Yes I did. All of these things<BR>add to the charm.<BR>If nothing else, you have to see the opening mass bisection.  It is stand alone in both its horrific nature and dark humor.  Half the team that put Army of Darkness together worked on it.  Very little CGI, mostly cunning camera work and rubber corpses.  Excellent!!!
B000148KK2|1.0|I've been a Diana Krall fan for some time.  I love &quot;Temptation,&quot; but the rest of the CD is just flat.  Not an Elvis fan at all, I could hear his influence way too much.  Go back to your own style Diana.
0316666343|2.0|The Lovely Bones is a very uneven work.  At times touching and memorable, at times monotonous, at times pedestrian, the prose of Ms. Sebold needs more polishing before it can be called great.  Some of the plot turns are silly and forced, and the effect on the reader is one of annoyance.  This would have made a superb first draft.  I hardly know how to account for this book's phenomenal success; perhaps, as in the title of her first book, Ms. Sebold got &quot;lucky.&quot;
B000089RVX|5.0|I will never forget the year 2003. Not because of the war with Iraq, or of any other kind of news, but because that was the year when new rock band from Arkansas Evanescence burst onto the music scene, and boy, did they make an entrance! The moment I heard the song &quot;Bring Me To Life&quot; on their album, I new that they were going to be a smash and gain world fame, and sure enough they did. They won a Grammy for Best New Artist of 2003. Every single song on their debut hit album are awesome. After listeing to this album for the first time, you are not gonna wanna put it down. It has been in my cd player for weeks now without being taken out because I keep on listeing and listening to it day after day. It's music you will never get tired of. Amy Lee's voice is so majestic and powerful, and she sings with such awesomeness and spirituality. This album is a MUST BUY for any music lover, whether you like rock or not. Trust me, you will not be dissapointed! I swear it! BUY IT!!!

Seriously, they just took some cameras and filmed shots of Japan. That's art? Don't be fooled by the Writing award, I could of written this movie in 3 seconds. Sofia isn't a genius or anything, she probably didn't even use a script.<br />This movie goes nowhere really. I don't watch movies to see the scenery. I don't come out of movies turning to people saying, &quot;Did you see that scenery, that was so f'in brilliant!&quot; This movie is bad and you can't cover that fact up.

No melodie, just a lame rap-like song that does not fit with the rest of the album. But other than that, the songs are all pretty good. Like Blood on the Dance Floor, Morphine (Which is an angry song), Ghosts and Is it Scary? (Which have the same beginning in both songs but different the rest of the way through), Super Fly Sister (A good song but it  repeats itself through out the song), Scream Louder (This is my favorite song on the album), Stranger in Moscow (One of MJ's all-time best songs),  Earth Song (It's a great song but I've never liked the remixes of it), History (Which is Ok) and You are Not Alone (Another great song but not remixed well. Listen to the singles version which is a lot better). So, I give this album three stars because it has some good stuff on it but other stuff that is not as good.
0385507755|5.0|I myself am an adict and this book is true to how it feels.  Anyone who is an addict or a significant other to an adict should read it.  The choped sentencing is the punctuation of the brain in the heat of addiction.  I often have felt the heat of addiction and the release of &quot;the fury&quot; throughout my life.  This book envelopes the feelings within.  What a great piece of literature and an excellent book to read.
B0001ZMWQO|4.0|No, Franz Ferdinand is not a person. Rather, it is a Scottish quartet who produced some of the most entertaining rock-y pop of the past year in &quot;Franz Ferdinand,&quot; shifting from U.K. stardom to the U.S. charts as well. It's undeniably a guilty pleasure, but it's also fun, catchy and fairly original.<br />The self-titled album starts off on a strong note with the bass-heavy pop &quot;Jacqueline,&quot; the kickoff to a slew of rock-tinged songs (the catchy, heavy &quot;Take Me Out,&quot; the slithery &quot;Darts of Pleasure&quot;), vaguely arty pop (the addictive &quot;The Dark of the Matinee&quot;), before finishing off with the quirky percussion, riffs and &quot;la la la&quot;s of &quot;40'.&quot;<br />One of the most pleasant things about &quot;Franz Ferdinand&quot; is the sense of fun that permeates the music. It sounds like a bunch of lads having a great time as they make some very danceable music. There are some dud melodies (&quot;Tell Her Tonight&quot;) after their strong opener, but it's all fairly entertaining.<br />However, Franz Ferdinand needs to work on their melodies -- they're pretty entertaining, but somewhat repetitive, like the rising and falling riff in &quot;Michael.&quot; The riff's good, but it fails to go anywhere. More solid are the bass lines and the thrashier guitar work, backed up some okay percussion.<br />Singer/lead vocalist Alex Kapranos is a good flexible vocalist; he can swoon and shout, and keeps his vocals from sinking into the mire of thrashing guitars. He also has the admirable talent of being able to shift his voice to make it softer or harder, depending on the song. Franz Ferdinand needs to do something about the terrible high-pitched backing in &quot;Tell Her Tonight,&quot; though.<br />It's not a classic by any stretch, but the rock-tinged pop of &quot;Franz Ferdinand&quot; is an entertaining diversion in the pop-rock world.
B000003TAR|4.0|This CD has some outstanding tracks like:<br />Heart Shaped Box<BR>Rape Me<BR>Dumb<BR>All Apologies (not the live one uve heard on the radio)<BR>Frances Farmer<BR>Very Ape (why does everyone say this sucks!? its cool! could easily be on nevermind)<br />anyways, besides those tracks, the rest are kinda mediocre, Milk It is pretty good, the chorus is real cool, but its a bit too boring for me, Serve The Servants is OK but the chorus is very lacking, Turrets is cool and hardcore but sounds like filler.<br />Bottom line, this CD is worth it for those great tracks and the rest is still listenable. <br />But be warned! its not 100% perfection like Nevermind! I got Nevermind first (im a new nirvana fan) and I was totally blown away that every song rocked. This one is good but a little disapointing.
B00005JMKI|3.0|Cinematography = amazing<BR>Acting = amazing<BR>Story = .... amazing....<br />I didn't give this movie more than three stars because the story is weird, depressing, shocking.  That's it.  If it is about America, shouldn't it involve more than that?  <br />Now, I have heard many call it not about America, but about human nature.  Then why did a guy from Denmark have to staple America to it?  <br />Let's say it is about human nature.  Yes, I agree, human nature is weird, depressing, shocking... but it's also comfortable, content, and natural, which this movie does not exhibit.  As a human, not an American, I am offended.  Well, not really offended, but more sorry for the guy if this is all the human nature, or America, he sees.
B00006879E|5.0|Maroon 5's first major release &quot;Songs About Jane&quot; has gotta be one of the best releases of last year. There are many different things about this album that make it such an achievement: Adam Levine's voice, perfect production, honest lyrics that are only slightly complex, and some really great harmonies of the kind that seem to be lacking in rock music these days. Also, I don't know if this will make much sense, but Maroon 5 just has a lot of personality and individualism that comes across on this disc. It's easy to listen to all the way through, and mixes different genres to create a perfect mood for different occasions. A must have, reguardless of musical preference.
0553278223|5.0|Ray Bradbury's Martian Chronicles is a story the holds many things true today even if the story itself is not a reality, and probably never will be.  Bradbury once again takes a cynic's position to writing as he has in other works (Fahrenheit 451) and includes many of the problems that man faced during his day and that man faces in ours.  Bradbury's style of writing is very unique in this book as well, in that rather then focusing on one specific set of characters, he jumps around with different characters all the time.  The Book could be considered more a interconnected collection of short stories as opposed to a novel.<br />The short stories in the book are all well written each including their own set of characters.  Some chapters do include some of the same characters, giving it the feeling that one part of the novel was connected to another.<br />I especially enjoyed the chapter titled \\"Usher II\\".  In this chapter a man is fighting the system that he will no longer be a part of.  In this chapter Bradbury does a few interesting things.  First, it seems that he connects this book to his one of his other books, Fahrenheit 451 from the quote, \\" `Of course.' Stendahl snorted delicately, a combination of dismay and contempt.  `How could I expect you to know blessed Mr. Poe?  He died long ago, before Lincoln.  All of his books were burned in the Great Fire.  That's thirty years ago-1975.'\\" (Page 134). I have read Fahrenheit 451 and immediately picked up the connection, whether intentional or not by Bradbury I do not know, but it interested me that he connected his books together.  If you have not read Fahrenheit 451 I suggest you do as it is another of Bradbury's great contributions to literature.  Bradbury also pokes a little bit of fun a fellow author, Ernest Hemingway, in this chapter.  In another quote by Stendahl, \\"Just as you put a stake through the heart of Halloween and told your film producers that if they made anything at all they would have to make and remake Ernest Hemingway.  My God, how many times have I seen For Whom the Bell Tolls done!  Thirty different versions.  All realistic.  Oh, Realism!  Oh, here, oh, now.  Oh Hell!\\" (Page 137).  In this chapter Bradbury also depicts the stupidity humans.  It yet another quote by Stendahl (can you tell he's my favorite character yet?) \\"Garrett?\\" called Stendahl softly.  Garrett silenced himself.  \\"Garrett,\\" said Stendahl, \\"do you know why I've done this to you?  Because you burned Mr. Poe's books without really reading them.  You took other people's advice that they needed burning.  Otherwise you'd have realized what I was going to do to you when we came down here a moment ago.  Ignorance is fatal, Mr. Garrett.\\" (Page 147).<br />Of course, this is just a small hint at what the entire book has to offer.  The entire book is full of points and questions that make you wonder about this world.  There was nothing I did not like about this book, I sped through it faster then any book I had ever read before, I recommend everyone read it.
B0000844I8|4.0|I own this because it comes before the series. The series is better.<br />Basically it's about a gate that was left on earth by aliens who built the pyramids. The gate takes you to the middle of the Sahara desert... oh, wait, it takes you to a far-off world where there are Bedouin - Ooops, no, not Bedouin, other humans seperated from earth. Sorry, I got confused.<br />Anyways, it's neat and you should watch it, then watch the series.

B00004X0Q0|5.0|At The Drive-In went out with a bang. A big one at that. Relationship of Command was their last and best album. Though it's sad that they're no longer together, at least they went out making one of my favorite albums of all time. It combines all of the best elements: Indie, Punk, Rage Against The Machine-esque vocals, and lyrics that are only singular to this band. The best track on the album is &quot;Rolodex Propaganda&quot; which also features another awesome vocalist known as Iggy Pop. If you are a fan of Punk or Indie music this album is a must-have.
6302787068|5.0|(Sorry if it seems boring at first, but don't worry, I get to the point.)<BR> I remember the first time I saw this movie. It was sitting on our video shelf upstairs, and, despite having this movie for years, I had never watched it. My sister was babysitting me(she had moved out of the house) and it was a special time for both of us. We wanted to watch a movie, and  she brought &quot;Aladdin&quot; downstairs. I informed her that I had never seen this movie, before, and that I wasn't sure that I would like it. My sister told me that this was a good movie, so I agreed.<br /> Boy, am I glad that I did! From the first scene(with the merchant displaying his products), I knew I would enjoy &quot;Aladdin&quot;. To this day it is one of my favorite movies of all time(and I'm a teenager!). Why do I like it so much? Three reasons:<BR>1) The plot. Even as a kid, I loved the romance, laughed at  the jokes(excluding some of the many references by Genie, of course), and experienced the emotions of the scenes as the crew intended.<BR>2) The voices. The characters just seem so real! From The Sultan- a joyful, peppy, and funny little fellow- to Jafar- who doesn't seem as real as the others, but, I admit, the way he is presented in this movie is kind of hard to work with. I absolutely LOVE the voices! They are so good at portraying the characters!<BR>3) The soundtrack. I am completely in love with the soundtrack(I have the original CD and the Spanish version of it. Can you tell I'm obsessed?). Kudos to Lea Salonga and Brad Kane. &quot;A Whole New World&quot; is by far the best Disney vocal song EVER when it comes to romance(in my humble opinion).<BR> If you have never seen this movie before, please do. You're really missing out.
B000063DHL|5.0|This is my favorite Maiden album. This is the album where Maiden discovered synthesizers ... but they integrated the keys much less invasively than say, Van Halen did on &quot;1984&quot;. This album does NOT lack for ferocity - it's still the same manic Maiden all out attack. But - the overall sound has become more complete and multi dimensional - something more closely resembling MUSIC - albeit ferocious music.
B00003CXCT|2.0|I love Star Wars, the original that is.   When the special editions came out, with the new scenes, I thought some were good (extended Death Star sequence, background windows in Cloud City), some were unneccessary (what was with that sequence with the band in Jabba's palace in ROTJ?) and some were just awful (Greedo shoots first ?!?  Han steps on Jabba's tail?!?!)  Most of these I just ignored; but know Lucas is changing even more.  At the end of ROTJ when Obi-wan's, Yoda's and Anakin's ghosts sit and watch the Ewok celebration, now they are removing the actor who played Anakin in the original and replacing him with the kid from the prequels.  What the heck??  What more can Lucas do to eviscerate these movies.  Needless to say I won't being buying these, instead I'll burn my old VHS copies to DVD and enjoy the original series at its best.
0064407667|1.0|The Baudelaire children's (Violet, Klaus, and Sunny) lives take a horrible turn when they receive the news that their parents have just died in a house fire. Sent to live with a distant relative, Count Olaf, they find themselves horribly mistreated. Their new guardian cares only about the fortune they possess, and treats them like slaves. Finding little or no help from other sources, the children know they have to do something- before they lose more than just their fortunes...<br />I did not enjoy this book. From the beginning, the author goes on and on about how this book is depressing and you shouldn't read it, (the book would be about ten pages shorter without him saying that all the time) which really gets annoying, and every other page he defines words for you, like you're too ignorant to figure them out for yourself. Mr. Poe, the man in charge of finding them a home, is so gullible it's absolutely inhuman, and the characters are very shallow. They have their materialistic strengths and weaknesses (Violet's good at inventing things, Klaus at thinking about things, Sunny biting things) but nothing under the surface that makes them special.
B00003CXQY|5.0|On of the best Disney movies EVER!! I have watched it over and over, and I'm still not tired of it. I loved Lion King and Alladin and some of the other Disney movies, but I couldn't watch them over and over again like I can this one. Never dissapointed when my daughter pulls this one off the shelf to watch!
0689859368|5.0|I really liked this book because it is a mystery and it was scary.    It's about the Grace family.  The three Grace children want to catch the boggart, because he does very mean things to them. My favorite character was Simon Grace. I like him because he likes animals like I do.  He was very brave.  He does dangerous things in order to try to find the boggart.  I think people who enjoy mysteries will love this book.  I want to read the whole Spiderwick Series soon.  I think they are great!

1592400876|5.0|Lynne Truss is a very funny woman who has an \\"inner stickler\\" aching to ride around, vigilante-like, with a bucket of white paint eliminating punctuation errors (such as the one in the title above) from public life.  But instead she has written a simple, short book on the unlikely topic of punctuation.  If you are the sort of person who cringes when someone writes a phrase like \\"the penguin has it's detractors,\\" you will occasionally find yourself pumping your fist in the air exclaiming \\"Yes! Yes!\\" in agreement with Truss's no-nonsense, no-excuses, laff-riot approach.<br />If you have little interest in punctuation-or even if you are frightened and suspicious of it-Truss is still worth a go.  Her objective is to convince you that punctuation is a thoughtful friend rather than a dictator.  For example, consider these alternative phrases and their varying interpretations, from Handel's Messiah:<br />\\"Comfort ye my people\\" (please go out and comfort my people) versus<BR>\\"Comfort ye, my people\\" (just cheer up, you lot; it might never happen)<br />Pretty different, eh? Without the comma, poor Handel risked being misunderstood.  <br />Truss is humorous rather than unforgiving; she even permits Americans their habit (strange to the British) of putting closing quotes after all other punctuation, and their preference for the \\"Oxford comma.\\" <br />And if you want to know what an \\"Oxford comma\\" is, read the book and be wittily enlightened.
B000148KK2|5.0|I am not surprised to see that people who like Krall's previous jazz standards CDs don't like this one.  It is inventive and very easy on the ears but in an original, creative way.  The songs on which Costello and Krall collaborate are excellent.  <br />I was NOT a Krall fan.  In fact, I did not like her previous collection of stale cotton candy versions of jazz standards.  They were simply boring musically and vocally.  Being a hard core jazz fan, I have heard much better versions of those standards.  To me she was a pretty face reintroducing standards to those who don't know they are standards.  This disc, however, has made me a fan.  <br />Hopefully she will keep up this inventive, original streak in spite of her fans temporary disappointment over her change in path or, better yet, her progression to maturity as a musician.
B00005JMFQ|4.0|&#34;Love,Actually&#34; is a feel-good Christmastime collection of love stories  from writer/director Richard Curtis that aim to say, in spite of strife and bad goings-on in the world, &#34;love  actually is all around&#34;. In London, beginning five weeks before Christmas, ten different but loosely connected love stories unfold.  As the Holiday season builds toward its climax, so do the relationships. The newly elected Prime Minister (Hugh Grant) falls head over heels for a member of his staff (Martine McCutcheon) on his first day on the job. A novelist (Colin Firth) and his Portuguese maid (Lucia Moniz) find love in spite of -or perhaps because of- the language barrier. Newlyweds and long-married couples alike discover chinks in their relationships and new possibilities. Young and old discover loss and new love. And throughout the film, the wonderful Bill Nighy plays a curmudgeonly aging pop star who uses every opportunity his new hit single provides him to inject a little sardonic  humor into the holiday cheer.<br /><br />Truthfully,at two hours and fifteen minutes, &#34;Love, Actually&#34; is too long for a romantic comedy. And it's slow in places. And it improves upon viewing during the Holiday season. But it's a charming film with a very appealing -and very large- cast. Sometimes it's a little too cute, but Bill Nighy's Billy Mack character is likely to amuse even resolutely cynical members of the audience. So there's something for everyone. And the love stories are more light-hearted than sappy. &#34;Love, Actually&#34; is fun, light entertainment.<br /><br />The DVD: Bonus features include an audio commentary, deleted scenes, a documentary on the film's music, a music video for &#34;The Trouble with Love Is&#34; by Kelly Clarkson, and a DVD-ROM (Windows only). The audio commentary features writer/director Richard Curtis and actors Hugh Grant, Bill Nighy, Thomas Sangster, and a couple of others whom I couldn't identify. Three of the actors are seeing the film for the first time, so their commentary is very conversational. Director Richard Curtis does mos t of the talking, however, and provides a lot of information. There are 37 minutes of deleted scenes, all of which are introduced by the director. Curtis' introductions and explanations are good, but, unfortunately, the scenes must be viewed one after the other. There is no way to choose what scenes to watch. In &#34;The Music  of Love Actually&#34;, director Richard Curtis talks about the five songs featured in the film and their influence on the script as he was writing it. Captioning is available in English. Subtitles and dubbing are available in French and Spanish.so their commentary is very conversational.

B00004W4UB|5.0|I recently purchased this movie on DVD.  It is a remarkable film.  ALL the actors are fantastic.  The Julia Roberts character is so interesting; timid but not really, loyal and loving in spite of her horrific upbringing. She was \\"proper\\" but certainly was following her interest in Jekyll/Hyde to where ever it was going to take her.<br />It is always interesting to me when a movie is sexy without any sex!!!  I absolutely swooned--and I mean SWOONED a couple of times--the relationship between Mary, Jekyll, and Hyde was steamy to me--the onscreen chemistry between Roberts and Malkovich topped it off. Sorry, I was wishing for a right-nasty shag scene or two.<br />I think some of the dialogue is particularly beautiful-<br />As far as accents:  I am a stickler on this point.  Married to a Brit for longer than I like to remember, I have become well-aquainted with nuances, regions, class, geographic influences, the ebb and flow of language in and out of England.  And, I have always had a real interest in dialects, words, and history. I feel it is important not to jump to conclusions about what we know today and what was then.  (I highly recommend THE STORY OF ENGLISH (PBS for anyone interested in this area)<br />I only get upset about poor accents/dialects in a film if it seems to me the actor is just lazy or uneducated about what they are doing.<br />I do not ever remember seeing Malkovich in any film in which he assumes a foreign dialect or accent, BUT, for some reason it always works for me.  He does something with the way he speaks that seems to transcend dialect, accent, time, place--it just always seems right no matter what the piece he is working on.<br />I will watch this movie many, many times--just another of those great \\"little\\" movies you hear little or nothing of that sticks with you--verbally, visually beautiful!  I hope you enjoy it as much as I do.

0790732254|5.0|There are only a few movies one get to see where a 10 out of 10 is really warranted after you've seen the film several times. It's easy to jump to conclusions shouting &quot;This is the best I've ever seen&quot; just after seeing one particular film. This one, however, is my fave movie, and I've seen a lot of both contemporary and old movies. Countless viewings after my initial, I still stand tall and proclaim this to be the best drama ever made.<br />Martha's and George's relationship is that of a long married couple who have grown weary of each other. Yet they cannot leave each other, it's the only life they know. It's the only reality they've set for themselves and they dare not get out. The fights and arguments are, at the end of the day, worth the trouble of keeping your identity, your everyday life, your grasp of reality.<br />The cast, all four of them, are meticulous in their performances. They complete each others presence, nurture the rivalry, fill the gaps and most importantly-delivers to the maximum of their potential.<br />Watching this is more like seeing it performed on stage than in a theatre or on your TV in your home. Early on, you get the feeling all is not well between George &amp; Martha, and as the guests arrive, the story is just about<br />to begin. The presence of the characters adds to the overall authenticicty of the story and the parts they play. It's a clichee, but I know many plays of &quot;Who's Afraid of Virginia Woolf&quot; has been set up: none can match the original.<br />If Citizen Kane is regarded as the best story ever told on the screen, this has to run very, very close.<br />In a heart-beat, I will give this 10 out of 10. That is saying A LOT, because I am a ferociously discriminating b***ard when it comes to movies!
B000002KET|4.0|My two favorite Sabbath songs are on this disc.  &quot;A National Acrobat&quot; and &quot;Sabbra Cadabra&quot; are amazing hard rock songs that could stand up against anything else in the genre.

B00009TB5G|1.0|Lord of the Rings is bad, and each movie is even worse than the last! Why is it getting all these awards and nominations is beyond me! I guess there are two kinds of people; the kind of people that CAN'T LIVE WITHOUT LORD OF THE RINGS, and people that CAN'T STAND LORD OF THE RINGS, I, myself, am one of those people that can't stand it, but you could be either, so my advice is.....<BR>RENT IT FIRST!!!<br />But please, don't get sucked up into all the hype, hence the title of my review. If you haven't already queerly fell in love with LOTR, don't bother to watch it. Please take my warning seriously. I know what I'm talking about. Save yourself!
0859652777|5.0|Having read this at least 4 times since I bought it last year, this is THE best book I have EVER pertained (and read completely through)in my life. It was so inspirational to me because of the way it was written. It takes you into the world of Brian Warner from the time he was in elementary Christian school to about the era of the Antichrist Superstar. This book is entertainingly humorous and at the same time a heartfelt anthem of Marilyn Manson's life. Includes escapades as a child into his grandfather's sex fetish basement, feelings he had growing up, encounters with drugs and strange people, and how he started his band and hit the music scene/the road to his success. Written by Marilyn Manson with Neil Strauss, this book has a cynically optimistic tone with vivid imagery that makes it interesting to read. Many great pictures are included within the book, including a mid-section of semi gloss prints. This is the perfect book for fans, or anyone looking for inspiration to follow their dreams and make their life what they want it to be. I HIGHLY reccomend this book.
B00005JMCN|5.0|I'm sure there are enough reviews that will pretty much serve as a guide as to what the movie is about, but I just want to give you a few key cons about the movie itself.(I'm not going to write any pros, because other than the few extremely minor flaws, the movie is perfect.)....<br />CONS...<BR>*It drags a little bit at some parts<br />*It's not really a &quot;Look, mommy, a horsey!&quot; movie, which isn't bad, but it's a little graphic for kids younger than I guess 7....They show the somewhat graphic results of club boxing (a bloody black eye), a kid dies in a car accident) But it really just depends on your kid.

B0001UZZWW|1.0|Went to store to buy this, but since the first DVD is FullScreen, forget it!  I knew the 3D one is short, but that's fine (weirdly, it is in widescreen format), but why the cropped version?<BR>Guess I'll wait till the new movie is on DVD and get the 3pack
B00004S8OP|5.0|If you like French opera, this is the CD for you.  The songs such as &quot;Belle&quot; or &quot;Le Temps de Cathedrales&quot; are very moving, compelling and true.  I would highly suggest this CD to people who really love music.
0007169582|4.0|I enjoyed this book!! I found it made me laugh then it made me cry and considering it is her first book; she did an excellent job. I will keep my eye out for her next one. Anyone who has experienced a real love in their life would be able to relate to this!!  Enjoy!!
B000092ZYX|5.0|This is my first time exploring Radio Heads artistic brillit manafestations that are just out of this world. This band has so much talent. There eeri instrumental beauty loops in and out of your ears like that of a detailed painting catching your eye a second not letting you exscape from it. They mastered the art of story telling through music. I mean my God how can't you fall in love with this hunting yet calming style of charater. I fill I sold my soul to the devil enjoying such horrifying music. Maybe this is how the angles of Heaven felt when satan's worship led them to the pits of hell. The power of music when mastered..man! The detailed music is so envoled and wrapped up you will never hear the same twice. <BR> It starts with the perfectly put yet simple song 2+2=5(The Lukewarm) It sarts off slow but not lacking its own coolness. <BR>  And I'm not going to tell you the rest just that the 3 first songs have relation with the Bible story Noah's Ark. 2+2=5,Devils way,haven't been paying attention,sit down,stand up,walk in the jaws of hell, RAIN DROP, RAIN DROPS!! ...Next song build an ark. See where I'm going with this. It's a spiritual war that God and Satan are between. Only open minds will understand what I'm talking about right now. Any way the cd is greatness. The cover by the way, every word has a meaning through the music. I'm telling you their music geniuses. Are like they say cookieeess..zzbeeeess.
B0001ZMWQO|1.0|This is a perfect CD for people who don't have any taste in music, but want to drop the name of the CD just to look cool. It sucks... really.
0312263120|4.0|I found this book very hard to put down.  I didn't emerse myself in the technical details, was purely reading for pleasure and found this a very pleasureable read.
0156027321|3.0|From the reviews, it seems that some readers of this book believe that they are getting objective information about how captive animals are managed in zoos.  This is not the case. Mr. Martel slants his descriptions to fit his layman's understanding of the art and science involved in keeping animals in the zoo.  I worked in a zoo for nearly 25 years, and I thought it might be useful to point out that for those who are interested in Mr. Martel's sources for his information on zoos and captive animals, you can see where he got his information by reading the books by H. Hediger (e. g. Wild Animals in Captivity, Man and Animal in the Zoo and The Psychology and Behavior of Animals in Zoos and Circuses).  Some of his descriptions of zoo animals/behavior/management are lifted right out of Hediger's books (and, to be fair, he does mention Dr. Hediger in the text).<BR>He did a good job of research on Hediger's work, but the animals and zoo he describes do not equal the real thing. As metaphors, his animals and his zoo are interesting reading, but please don't come away thinking that what happens in this book is close to reality in terms of the zoological parts--they are a blend of Martel's research and his fertile imagination.  Life in the zoo for captive animals is one of forced adaptation and--quite unfortunately--differs little today from its 19th Century origins. Enjoy these animals and their zoo as metaphors and you won't be misled.
B000023VR6|5.0|I was shocked when someone gave this CD the worst review then said to get Eazy E... i like Eazy E too but the point is that Dre made Eazy E famous in the first place... this album is one of those CDs you can just put in and listen to and rap along to even if its the first time you've heard the song. Eminem and Dre in &quot;Forgot About Dre&quot; are the perfect combination, followed by the next track &quot;The Next Episode&quot; a great classic. Dre is the master of beats and although some lyrics are slow in a few verses they still flow evenly with the beat and prove a point...<BR>My Favorite tracks are:<br />The Watcher (like how eminem did the chorus and dres rhymes just mix perfectly with his beats)<br />Still DRE (just a great song)<br />Forgot About Dre (know the song by heart and the beat is a masterpiece. eminems speed and perfect rhyme scheme make it excelent. my fav dre verses are in this song dre definatly shows full talent in this one)<br />The Next Episode (great beat awsome finish on this one, snoop and dre def hav great verses... just a classic to rap along to)<br />One more thing, i love Kurrupts verses i think hes got alot of skills but just not the full fame he deserves, would like to see more of him in the future along with his little brother Roscoe that released his album &quot;Philaphornia&quot; which i think was awsome and one of my best buys.<br />Definatly get this album not only does it show the rapper that started this game it shows the tru talent of many other artists out there.
B0001UZZWW|4.0|If you are buying this set thinking you are getting two separate movies you will be dissapointed.  If you are buying the set because you want the first Shrek movie, and don't mind paying a couple of dollars extra for a short cartoon sequence with some 3D effects, it's worth the purchase.  If you are a Shrek fan, this is deffinitely something you want to add to your Shrek collection.  And with the second movie coming out, this is a good warm-up movie.  Plus, if you cannot make it to Universal Studios, at least you can see the 3D feature, even if it is not as impressive as when you see it in their humongous screen.
B000089RVX|5.0|Before I heard this CD, I was pretty closed minded to music.  But Evanescence has opened me up to a lot of different genres.  This is an amazing band, and a great CD.  Unlike a lot of albums, where there are only a few good songs, every song on Fallen is great.<br />Going Under: 10/10. A very strong opening song about a bad relationship.  Amazing vocals and great guitars, it starts out hard and fast. <br />Bring Me To Life: 8/10. You've probably heard this one on the radio.  It's a powerful song with guest Paul McCoy of 12 Stones.  It's a good song, but sometimes Paul McCoy gets a little hard to listen too.<br />Everybody's Fool: 10/10.  This is one of my favorites.  It's also Evanescence's new single.  The lyrics are amazing in this song.  It's about people who are completely fake, but no one can see it.<br />My Immortal: 10/10. One of their slower songs.  My Immortal is a gourgeos ballad with a great piano part.  This song made me cry!  It's about losing someone you love.<br />Haunted: 9/10.  A slower song, but not light! This is a great song with creepy lyrics. In one part of the song, there's a sound effect with beeping like a heart moniter. It also has a great choir part in it.<br />Tourniquet: 9/10.  This is a great, powerful song.  It's a christian take on suicide.  The idea is that if all your sins are forgiven, would you go to heaven or hell?<br />Imaginary: 10/10.  Tourniquet leads right into this song.  Awesome tune + great lyrics. Another powerful song, and one of my favorites.<br />Taking Over Me: 10/10. Probably the least 'dark' song, for the lyrics- but that doesn't mean it's bad!  It has a great opening, starting with piano, then leading into heavier guitars.<br />Hello: 10/10.  This song is full of grief, and a little depressing, but it's really a breathtaking song.  It's slow and mournful.<br />My Last Breath: 10/10. Another one of my favorites.  It has great lyrics and a great melody.  It has a great opening, and the lyrics are great, too.<br />Whisper: 10/10.  This song is an great ending song.  It's another hard song, but near the end, there's a latin chant meaning &quot;Save us from evil, save us from danger&quot;.  The chant is cool, but creepy.  <br />Too many people say Evanescence is overrated or nothing special without hearing the whole album.  I'd recommend this album to everyone.  Buy this CD- you won't be sorry.
B00008J2DQ|2.0|Every song on this album sounds just like songs off of their first two albums. If you want good Godsmack, buy their first two albums. This is sub-par metal...Godsmack is still Faceless...
B00000IFP6|5.0|Any problems a listener might have with this cycle will be in taste exclusively. No notes land amiss in this performance, and Zinman's interpretation is defensible throughout. There is always good logic from the baton, which draws forth clear oratorical Beethoven. Each note always points to the next, and each phrase does likewise. The engineering quality is good and spacious, and Zurich's fairly small ensemble enables cleanliness and lightness of play beyond those of any other modern-instrument performance that this listener has heard. Tempos are unorthodox, especially in the slow movements, which tend to be slightly faster than most recordings. But this does not hinder the performance in any way. And as far as Barenreiter's edition of the music goes, all of its changes and additions are good ones, and prompted no outrage from these ears. All in all, a great recording of the symphonies. Some listeners may disagree, but that is only a matter of taste. <br />If you are looking for great Beethoven, consider this set, George Szell's excellent cycle, the '60s Karajan set, Toscanini with NBC, The Vienna Philharmonic with Bohm or Bernstein, and anything with the name 'Kleiber' on it. And those are just for starters. But no matter who one might prefer, this reviewer sincerely believes that this set will contribute well to an attentive listener.<br />Now for a personal touch. some reviewers have written that the singing on Zinman's 9th is bad. I disagree. The baritone in particular is superb, and the rest of the quartet is more than competant (in fact, I believe the quartet is better than Szell's, and Szell's is my favorite cycle). The chorus might have done well with a few more members, but the current reading stands without difficulty.
B0000028M7|5.0|GREAT ALBUM. 5 Stars. Classic songs: Them Bones, Down in a Hole(the definitive AIC classic),Rooster(another definitive classic),Angry Chair, Would? Need I say more?
B0000AQS0F|5.0|I like Angel &amp; Buffy, so I thought that this would be worth a look.  It was original and fantastic.  I watched it inside a week, after the first Two episodes I was hooked.<BR>It was quite sad to come to the end and know that there is no more.<BR>Definalty would advise everyone to watch it and enjoy!
B000005RS6|5.0|I had pretty much given up on deep Purple after the House of Blue Light and a very quick listen to Purpendicular but something made me check this album out.  The opening track is Fireball and I half expected it to be some tired old rockers trotting out a mediocre version. Whoa Nelly!  Was I wrong. This track and every other one is blistering! The band absolutely cooks on this album and its so cool having a complete, uninterrupted live show, in the correct order and surprise, surprise a horn section.  After this I went out and bought every DP album I'd missed, saw the band at every opportunity, and was first in line for new releases. They have restored my faith and I promise you they do not disappoint, live or on record now. The only explanation I can give is Steve Morse. We owe him not just for his playing but for breathing new life into a band that was in danger of dying out due to internal conflict.  Great sound and mix on this record too. So much tighter and better sounding than Nobody's Perfect. You can tell they were having fun. Get it!
B000174LVQ|5.0|. . . I initially felt I wouldn't like this disc.  After all, I didn't want vocals, &quot;palmas&quot; (handclaps), and various other distractions.  <br />Yet what the inimitable Paco de Lucia has done here is to definitively demonstrate the absolutely essential role vocals, &quot;palmas,&quot; and percussion play in Flamenco music.<br />These seemingly extraneous elements provide the rhythmic ground and metrical interest that serve to invest Flamenco music with the energy that makes is so special--even unique--among world musics.  <br />No, we DON'T just want to hear the guitar going off; we want, instead, to hear the guitar situated in a rhythmic context that both frames it and provides it with the occasion to shine.<br />That is the genius of the absolutely remarkable and even revelatory disc: Paco de Lucia has completely understood and imagined the optimal setting for his spectacular music and rendered it with a faithfulness and lucidity seldom if ever encountered before.<br />Pass this one up at your peril.
0684823454|5.0|Biographies are often interesting because the book is well written or because the subject had an extraordinary life.  Churchill's autobiography is both.  Churchill's early life was quite extraordinary.  Using his connections (or more likely, his mother's bed partners), he was able to see service at many of the British Empire's hotspots between 1895 and 1905.  He glosses over quite a bit.  His mother and father both were somewhat dissolute personages but he presents an idealized portrait of them.  But he gives in great detail the excitement that he experienced in India and the Sudan, and of course his daring escape from Boer captivity during the South African War.<br />And the writing!  Churchill was a wonderful writer.  Despite his upper class origins, his father and mother blew most of their money. Churchill himself enjoyed high living.  So Churchill for most of his life lived a rather hand to mouth existence.  His writing and lectures are what paid the bills all those years.  So his writing was well crafted and entertaining.
B000001ESP|5.0|This is a great album from start to finish. Although I find myself listening to &quot;Tom Sawyer&quot; and &quot;Limelight&quot; less since they are placed ad infinitum on my local classic rock station. But the good thing is I can get more into the less popular tracks. All the songs on this album have been performed live. The Camera Eye is the only one not to be released live. Hopefully now with RUSH IN RIO and Rush breaking their tradition of a live album after every four studion album they'll be releasing some performances from the vaults. Anyway, before I read someone else's review I was not aware that Camera Eye was over ten minutes long, it didn't feel that long.
B0000DJZA5|3.0|These are the quite familiar performances that Beatle fans know from the 1970 &quot;Let It Be&quot; Lp; the question is, why?  The personality of the mix is convalescent: this isn't  so much a &quot;naked&quot; version of the &quot;Let It Be&quot; Sessions as a &quot;hospital gown&quot; or &quot;white-terry robe&quot; remix.  It's dead-flat as a friend emerging from a week's flu, with even seemingly natural, ambient echo dialed out of the mix.  The EQ levels are rigorously, but nonsensically, flat as well.  Bottom line: this sounds notably worse in almost every respect from the Spector mix.  The surprise is why McCartney and whoever else involved didn't take an opportunity to give us a good, professionally mixed seventy-to-ninety minutes of the hundreds of hours of &quot;Get Back&quot; sessions, which are available in interesting but irregular (or just bad) working mixes in bootleg form. Yeh, as Lennon and any bright child would tell us, there's a lot of junk in those sessions, but there are also at least 2CD's worth of interesting alternates and unheards.  There's little point in having the &lt;same&gt; &quot;Let It Be&quot; Lp from 1970 with a pancake-flat mix.

B00005NTJK|5.0|If you can appreciate great musicians, at the top of their game, if you enjoy fantastic songwriting, if you want to hear a band on the verge of breaking out, you must BUY THIS DISK! Ian Anderson wrote some of the most memorable Tull on this disk alone. &quot;Cry you a Song&quot; is a masterpiece that will echo in your head for days. Martin Barre's guitar work on this album is simply great. Ian Anderson's vocals and flute work show why Tull has such a loyal following four decades after their debut. &quot;Teacher&quot; is such a fun song, and the instantly recognizable bass line intro still gets the blood pumping! If you thought Jethro Tull's career began with &quot;Aqualung&quot; do yourself a favor and BUY THIS DISK! It's amazing how the quality songs on Benefit still stand up in the 21st Century! This is a heavier Tull than thier debut and I feel a stronger album than the 3rd disk &quot;Stand Up&quot;. If you are learning to play guitar or bass, this disk should be required listening!!
B00005YW4H|2.0|She is a way too lucky lounge singer. I think many people think when she's singing these songs she's poured a lot of heart and soul into them. However, she did not write these songs, and her voice is just her trying make herself sound as if she's Billie Holiday; when you hear her talk her voice sounds nothing like her singing voice. She's just another talentless young wannabe star the music industry throws at us in a different formula than that usually used in the pop music genre. The most credit she has for herself is that she can play the piano; and there's plenty of piano players way better than her.
B0000C6E4D|2.0|I'm not a huge Sarah fan by any means but I quite enjoy her older work....songs like Into the Fire and Possession.  Her latest cd, &quot;Afterglow&quot; lacks spark and passion.  The first single, &quot;Fallen&quot; is a put me to sleeper.  Not her finest work by any means.
B00005JLU1|5.0|I Love this movie, it brings back the day of the good old 60's.  When I was like 15 or 16 years old, my friends and I used to watch this movie so much that we practically knew all the words to it.  We even had nick names for each person.  My favorite person is hatchet face, i like her personality.  I defently think that they should put this on DVD.
B000002KE2|4.0|Picture, 1972. What a year in history, particularly American history. Look it up, you'll see. :)<br />At any rate, while there are many *marginal* tracks on this offering, there is one, to wit, &quot;Snowblind,&quot; that is the *epitome* of what Black Sabbath truly exemplified, as was caught in a few other songs in their history, such as &quot;Children of the Grave,&quot; &quot;Megalomania,&quot; &quot;A National Acrobat,&quot; &quot;Dirty Women,&quot; &quot;Children of the Sea,&quot; &quot;Born Again,&quot; and others...
B0001LJC2K|3.0|'Don't fix it if it ain't broke' is the simplest way to duplicate a successful formula, yet so many bands throughout the annals of music history seem to stray away from this. Muse isn't one of them. 'Absolution' can be considered the more apocalyptic brother (as if their sound isn't already apocalyptic) of 'Orgin Of Symmetry'. Along with brooding Thom Yorke vocals, the Radiohead-isms will continue to follow Muse around, perhaps with a little more operatic-style gradiosity. Front and center are the prog-like keyboards, going from the fluidity of Yes and Pink Floyd to classical/chamber music harpsichords, evoking moods from ominous and flamboyance to the profound. Thrown into the mix are Cooper Temple Clause thrashing guitar riffs, showing that Muse can still rock after drifting through the clouds, grey clouds of course, capturing the calm before the storm. 'Absolution' shouldn't disappoint Muse fans, and just based on it's strength, it shouldn't disappoint music fans as well.
B0000DD7LB|5.0|I never thought I would say this about a Britney album, but 'In The Zone' really changed my mind about her music.  The entire album, from start to finish, is unbelievably infectious and the quality of the songs is very high.  Pay no mind to the haters who haven't even heard this album.  This is far better than the latest albums of Beyonce, Jessica Simpson, Janet Jackson, Madonna, etc.  I guarantee you'll enjoy this album if you actually hear it.  Props to Britney for releasing such a great collection of pop music!!
B000002I57|5.0|I passed on the original LP, but this reissue with twenty additional minutes of music by, on the one hand, the quintessential jazz blues player and, on the other, the most influential jazz innovator of the past half century, led me to reconsider my decision of 40 years ago (I was poorer then, too).<br />Listening to the album again, I'm finding that the source of my reservations at the time are now a source of pleasure.  Not only are the primary players conscious of their different musical styles, but each brings a &quot;second&quot; for support: Coltrane has Paul Chambers, his colleague from the Miles Davis Group, and Jackson has Connie Kay, his associate from the the Modern Jazz Quartet.  The result is a rhythm section that is never quite in synch.  Paul lays down as powerful, unflappable a bass line as I've ever heard from him while Connie Kay reminds me of a trailer or dinghy faithfully in tow.  Coltrane leans forward on the time, keeping up with his man, while Bags waits on the beat, as though listening to his own accomplice.<br />Is there a &quot;winner&quot;? The advantage is definitely Coltrane-Chambers.  On the other hand, Hank Jones is so effective in bridging the gap, playing in the &quot;middle&quot; of the beat, that the whole thing works.  In fact, the undeniable tension in the rhythm along with the players figuring out ways to deal with it create a whole new layer of musical interest.<br />I'm really inclined to four and a half stars, but the principals, not to mention  the performance of the roadbuilder, Paul Chambers, forbid it.
B0001I55OC|2.0|This was an &quot;okay&quot; movie.  I would have given it three stars had they done one simple thing, eliminate Paul Walker's character.  I haven't read the book, but it seems to me that this character was added as an afterthought simply for Walker's star power.  Normally I would overlook this, but Walker was a constant distraction.  Are we to believe that the son of a Scottish academic turned out to be a California beach bum?  He resembles an overly macho Ted Theodore Logan (Keanu Reeves in Bill and Ted's Excellent Adventure) who throws around the word &quot;bro&quot; like Ted threw around &quot;dude&quot;.  We find this character in of all places, an archaeological dig in France.  He had no skills essential to the mission, nor did he seem to affect the plot in any way whatsoever.  He was an altogether useless and out of place character.  <br />Reeves was stuck in the character of Ted for a decade until The Matrix.  Like Reeves, Walker is stuck in the role as Brian O'Conner from Fast and the Furious, and unless he learns how to act his career will quietly diminish as his boyish good looks fade.  <br />I can't totally overlook the film just because of the shortcomings of a single actor, but he just got too much camera time....and too little attention from the writers.  This is far from one of Richard Donner's better works.
0446677450|1.0|Kiyosaki has credibility problems and readers should do their own research a I've done. Consider: Rich Dad never existed, the childhood ancedotes are pure fiction and organizations like Amway are what made his books popular. Now think about it and then check him out.
B00005JMEW|5.0|Tarantino's films are always in a genre all on their own, and Kill Bill is no different. If you haven't enjoyed his previous films, then you probably won't like this one either. If you are one of those people, I pity you. Kill Bill runs circles around most of today's action-flicks. If you think that some parts of the movie are over-the-top, you are missing the point....they are SUPPOSED to be that way!
B000148KK2|1.0|I have enjoyed all of Diana Krall's albums ... before &quot;The Girl in the Other Room&quot;. It was a struggle to hear this new one all the way through and once was enough. It sounds as though she's making up the lyrics as she goes along.  Diana, please don't go in this direction.  Stick with the old standards which you do so well.
B000002UAF|5.0|The Beatles made their film debut in 1964 with &quot;A Hard Day's Night,&quot; and this album is the accompanying soundtrack (although only the first seven songs are heard in the film). &quot;A Hard Day's Night&quot; is unique in that it's the only Beatles  album to be exclusively written by John Lennon and Paul McCartney, with no songs written by George Harrison, no cover songs, and no lead vocals by Ringo Starr. Still, the album is outstanding pop from beginning to end, giving the Beatles yet another jewel in their musical crown, and *also* showing that the band were just starting to evolve into producing music a tad more deeper than the little rock 'n' roll ditties they started out with (though I totally love the group's early ditties, don't get me wrong!). Immortal Beatles rock 'n' rollers like the title song, &quot;I'm Happy Just To Dance With You&quot; (with George on lead vocal), &quot;Tell Me Why,&quot; &quot;Can't Buy Me Love,&quot; &quot;Any Time At All,&quot; and &quot;You Can't Do That&quot; are all in residence, but the Fab Four also surprise you with the gorgeous beauty of &quot;If I Fell,&quot; &quot;And I Love Her,&quot; &quot;Things We Said Today,&quot; and &quot;I'll Be Back.&quot; &quot;I Should've Known Better&quot; is another pop classic, &quot;I'll Cry Instead&quot; is a fine country-ish number, and &quot;When I Get Home&quot; is one of my all-time favorite Beatles songs, an awesome little pop-rocker. With Beatlemania in full swing, John, Paul, George &amp; Ringo lay down another Beatles classic with &quot;A Hard Day's Night.&quot; It's totally Fab!
B00008H2LB|5.0|I really liked this cd a lot! It is one of the best Linkin Park cd's. Linkin Park is one of the best music groups.
B0001M0A4I|5.0|&quot;Seven: A Suite For Orchestra&quot; is the debut classical album by the one-and-only Tony Banks, the keyboard player for Genesis, and it consists of five pieces that Tony wrote specifically for the album, plus two older pieces Tony had lying around that hadn't found a home yet. It's performed by the London Philharmonic Orchestra, conducted by Mike Dixon, with Tony chipping in here &amp; there on piano. And it is absolutely gorgeous music. It's impossible for me to single out a single track. All I can tell you is that this music is breathtakingly beautiful. And if you're familiar with Tony's work in Genesis---and bonus points are awarded to you if you know his solo material as well---you will *instantly* recognize the powerful melodies, moods, and musical nuances that couldn't be written by anyone else but Tony Banks. And, being released on the Naxos budget label, the price of this CD is practically a steal, so you're definitely getting a GREAT deal in purchasing it. I know that Tony had this classical album in the pipeline for many years, and, as a longtime fan, I wondered if it would *ever* be released. But here it is at last, and I can happily say to you that it was so worth the wait. With &quot;Seven: A Suite For Orchestra,&quot; Tony Banks takes a brilliant first step as a classical composer, and I'd love to hear more. It's a beautiful classical album, and I can't recommend it highly enough. Congratulations, Tony!
B00006AUIG|2.0|I was expected to watch a horror &amp; dark mystery movie in a weekend. &quot;Session 9&quot; seems pretty interesting enough for its story, feels so creepy &amp; big swallowing atomsphere &amp; its experimental filming for such an abandoned large enclosure.<BR> <BR>Take a deep breath to follow the cameras moving along, into the deep long corridors and many more rooms at far lonely end with barely lights in. I admitted it wasn't all that bad at the beginning.<br />Not until those misguided sub plots getting in, purposed to kill time obviously. Otherwise, the audience'd keep counting how much time left. e.g. in the middle of the story those coins, rings, eyeballs &amp; then those dropped old coins again makes me going mad, ideas like counting days from Mon, Tue, Wed isn't a good idea particularly for already a  loosen structure. It wouldn't help those audiences already felt asleep. Many more plots like old patient Mary/ her graveyard broken pieces/ her room no./ old photos etc...which mean they are all actually being no big deals at the end??? Truly big disappointment.<br />This isn't a deep pyschological shocking, frightening piece of drama like &quot;The Shining&quot;, &quot;Rosemary's Baby&quot; or &quot;The Fog&quot;. While it gives you rarely thrilling but only a bit at the end of around 5 minutes, it's getting similar as finish watching &quot;Identity&quot; that also finally rushes to an very uncompromising &amp; unsatisfying ending.
B0000683DH|3.0|When I was young 'un (back when I was about 8 or so), The Wrath of Khan was actually my least favorite Star Trek film to date. Having seen it again on TNN recently, I'm not sure why I disliked it so much, and while I won't call it the best Star Trek film (that honor lies with First Contact), it's an entertaining adventure highlighted by good performances, memorable special effects, and two tense, if also somewhat underwhelming, space battles.<br />The Wrath of Khan is a sequel to the episode, \\"Space Seed\\", where evil genius Khan and his gang were exiled on a planet. Khan and his group escape, hijack a starship, and plans vengeance upon Kirk. Then there's the genesis device, a machine capable of creating new life, but also has the potential to destroy those the living. It all leads to a tense showdown between the two biggest egos in the universe.<br />There are a lot of things about The Wrath of Khan that still bug me. For one, there's the slow as snails pacing.  Director Nicholas Meyer often said this film was inspired by the nautical adventures of Horatio Hornblower, but I distinctly remember two things that place such works (as seen in, say, the recent Master and Commander) above Wrath of Khan: 1) watching two big spaceships blasting away at each other isn't nearly as fun as seeing two big 19th century warships firing cannonballs upon each other on the high seas and 2) Hornblower often boarded enemy ships, but seeing as this never happens in Wrath of Khan, we're back to the concept of watching two spaceships duking it out.<br />I can't really quite begin to emphasize how small-scale space battles aren't my cup of tea. Not helping that problem is the fact that the Enterprise never actually feels like it's in any genuine danger, not necessarily because you expect that most of the crew will make it through the situation alive, but because it just seems like a far more powerful ship than the Khan-controlled Reliant.  <br />Then there's Khan and his gang of marauders themselves, who look more like rejects from a He-man audition than genuinely menacing villains. Matter of fact, most of Khan's men do little more than stand around and \\"pose.\\"  They also look a little young for a group that's been marooned for fifteen years, but maybe that's just the side effect of genetic tampering.  This, however, still doesn't explain why Khan himself looks particularly aged from his last encounter with Kirk, and I don't think something as simple as stress caused by survival responsibilities could explain it.  He may be the leader, but if everyone is also as potentially strong and as intelligent as he is, I see no reason why they couldn't care for themselves.<br />The plot generally lacks any sense of urgency.  Even in the thick of the action or in apparently dire situations, the film does little to generate any building suspense.  The Wrath of Khan simply doesn't find the right balance between action, science fiction, and characters.  The only genuine sci-fi on hand (aside from all the space travel and the like) is the Genesis project, and even that takes a backseat to the Kirk/Khan rivalry.<br />Other complaints:  though certain tracks of Horner's score (especially the \\"prepping for battle\\" scene) are rousing, too much of the music is just grating and certainly can't hold a candle to Jerry Goldsmith's famed Trek score.  Meyer's camerawork is also rather flat, lacking a sense of true rhythm or energy.  Even Robert Wise's direction in The Motion Picture felt slicker than this.<br />With those criticisms out of the way, there was some stuff I enjoyed about the film. William Shatner and Ricardo Montalban make for an effective protagonist/antagonist duo, with the former delivering a genuinely good performance and the latter chewing the scenery with aplomb. Leonard Nimoy is excellent as Spock, as always. <br />The most memorable scene of the whole film is the emotional climax, which features the death of a major character. This represented the first time that Star Trek could not only engage the mind and rattle the nerves, but also touch the heart (and put a lump in your throat). The Wrath of Khan appears to be the series fan-favorite, and I can see why, but too much of it doesn't click with me. Still, it's somewhat recommended to those looking for a space opera with the occasional dose of action and pathos.
6305971935|3.0|When it comes to time travel on the screen, there have been many, many attempts.  My favorite is the STAR TREK episode in which Shatner travels back in time, falls in love with Joan Collins, and she gets killed, and he has to leave her behind.  In THE PHILADELPHIA EXPERIMENT, things turn out a little better for the timecrossed lovers.  Based on what was supposedly a real experiment in 1943, the movie chronicles the fate of Michael Pare and Bobby DiCicco, who during the experiment in Philadelphia find themselves in 1984 Nevada.  Somehow the same scientist who did the 1943 experiment is still at it, trying to make a town invisible.  In doing so, he opens a vortex that brings the two 40s soldiers to modern times.  Pare falls in love with the wonderful Nancy Allen (CARRIE, BLOWOUT, DRESSED TO KILL), and their romance is a key element in the eventual climax.<br />The special effects are commendable for a 1984 movie; the direction is adequate, and most of the performances very good.  Nancy combines her naivete with those lovely eyes to make a wonderful heroine, and Michael Pare shows a good range of emotion in trying to decide where he truly belongs.<br />This is one of the better time travel movies, and inspired a sequel with Brad Johnson.
B00015HVI8|5.0|Great sci-fi is a rarity these days, with too many TV shows (Andromeda, Farscape, the last three Star Trek series) boasting mediocre acting and writing, at best, to go along with admittedly impressive visuals and occasionally very intriguing concepts and plot strands.  Stargate SG-1 is the exception, easily the best sci-fi television series since Star TreK: TNG, and possibly the best ever, period.  <br />With its mixture of intelligent and engrossing stories, terrific acting, cool special effects, and thrilling action, no other show on TV comes close to the combination of quality episodes SG-1 delivers.  Season six, in particular, is quite possibly the best season of the series, though admittedly, this is the only season of SG-1 that I've seen every episode of.  Season six stood out with the addition of Corin Nemec's Jonas Quinn, whom I liked at least as much as Daniel Jackson, probably more.  He was a fantastic addendum, adding much humor and enthusiasm to the show.  It's too bad he was booted off the show by season seven.<br />Redemption (part I): B+, a terrific premiere episode that presents the first dangerous threat from Anubis.  Drags when it focuses on Teal'c's personal life, but a necessary set-up.<BR>Redemption (part II): A+, quite possibly the best episode of Stargate, period.  It's as suspenseful and exciting as TV gets, and not even David Hewlett's annoying Dr. Mckay can mar it.<BR>Descent: A, that's two absolute winners in a row with yet another one of the all-time best episodes; SG-1 investigates a seemingly empty Goa'uld mothership.  This episode boasts the most in-depth and creepily atmospheric exploration of a spacecraft since Event Horizon.<BR>Frozen: B+, intriguing episode focuses on the discovery of a human enclosed in Arctic ice.  <BR>Nightwalkers: B, Invasion of the Body Snatchers-inspired episode about a town that is possessed at night. Derivative, but entertaining and with a few nicely done eerie moments.<BR>Abyss: B-, Jack O'Neill is captured when seemingly betrayed by the Tok'ra symbiote that healed him and has to deal with torture from Ba'al and discovers Daniel Jackson might actually still be alive.  Nothing special plot-wise, but RD Anderson has great chemistry with Michael Shanks, and the prison cell is a cool design.<BR>Shadow Play: B-, decent episode about possible world war on Jonas Quinn's home planet.  The plot twist is quite reminiscent of a certain Best Picture Oscar winner a few years back.<BR>The Other Guys: B+, very funny episode that introduces goofball Felger, who sets out to rescue SG-1 when they're captured by Anubis' forces.  Surprisingly enough, this episode is funny without hampering the excitement.  <BR>Allegiance: B, an invisible killer stalks a refugee camp; a bit derivative of Forbidden Planet and Predator, but effective and suspenseful, nonetheless.<BR>Cure: A, a miracle cure called Tretonin apparently has both a horrible side effect and an even more shocking discovery of its origin. This story presents one of the series' most compelling ethical questions and is one of the season's best.<BR>Prometheus: A-, the spacecraft Prometheus is hijacked; another very exciting and suspenseful episode.<BR>Unnatural Selection: B+, SG-1 arrives at a Replicator-overrun planet and discovers some strange inhabitants.  The visit to the planet is atmospheric and the final scene is particularly memorable.<BR>Sight Unseen: B-, a very lightweight episode reminiscent of From Beyond.  <BR>Smoke &amp; Mirrors: A-, when Senator Kinsey is killed, all evidence points to Jack O'Neill as the assassin.  Plot-wise, this is one of the most enthralling episodes of the season.<BR>Paradise Lost: B-, an initially very intriguing premise about a hidden cache of weapons and a search for a society that lives in paradise doesn't really go anywhere, but it's still not bad.<BR>Metamorphosis: B, experiments being performed by the Goa'uld Nirrti in search of the perfect host leads to some troubling discoveries on the inhabitants of a planet.<BR>Disclosure: A-, ultimately little more than a clip show, but this episode does an excellent job of relating the history of the Stargate while also portraying the tensions between nations over the SG program.<BR>Forsaken: B+, SG-1 arrives on a planet of stranded pilots that are being hunted by aliens in the forest, but the situation isn't quite as it seems.  The plot twist is fairly obvious, but it's nonetheless a very exciting episode.<BR>The Changeling: C+, probably my least favorite episode of the season, this is one of those &quot;what is reality and what isn't?&quot; episodes that's more than a little plodding and tiresome.  It's a nice acting showcase for Christopher Judge, whose Teal'C is experiencing different lives and can't tell which is real, but little else.<BR>Memento: B+, a test flight of the Prometheus results in an accident that strands the crew and SG-1 on the far side of the galaxy.  To get the necessary supplies, they need to find a stargate, but they arrive on a planet that seems unwilling to help.  The lack of trust from the aliens is an interesting twist on the usual &quot;aliens who arrive on Earth, but are distrusted by humans&quot; angle.<BR>Prophecy: B, Jonas Quinn gains the ability to tell the future, and must prevent the deaths of Colonel O'Neill and Teal'c.<BR>Full Circle: B+, the season finale features the return of Daniel Jackson, who warns SG-1 that Anubis is in search of an artifact that could make him virtually invincible.  The episode boasts a nice return to Abydos (the planet that &quot;started&quot; it all, if you've seen the movie), a welcome guest star role from Alexis Cruz, and some first-rate action sequences.
0345347951|5.0|It will now be hard to film Childhood's End because the opening, with the great ships suspended over the cities of the earth, was cribbed, intentionally or by coincidence, for Independence Day. That's a pity because it would make a tremendous film being a shattering and most skilfully written story. Here the visitors have not come to despoil our planet, indeed so well put together is the plot that we may well forget to ask ourselves why they have bothered to come along and preside over a golden age of universal peace, prosperity and others of Clarke's (and my) liberal preoccupations such as no cruelty to animals. The book is not 200 pages long but it combines Clarke's special narrative gifts as a short-story writer with a vision of the whole nature and purpose of the universe that I find staggering and intolerably poignant to this day, 30 years after I first read it.<br />Brian Aldiss has perceptively said that if Stapledon has a successor it is Clarke, and Clarke himself has told us how deeply Stapledon has influenced him. However this book resembles Stapledon in nothing except the scale of the concept. Childhood's End is written by a recognisable human being with power over our emotions -- power indeed! When the overlord first shows himself, I wondered whether the story could ever recover from such a dramatic coup so early on. I need not have worried. The story has not even begun: the truth, when we finally get it not far from the end, wrenches my innards to this day, and between times the crux of the narrative (the seance) is as brilliant a false clue as was ever laid by Agatha Christie. Those of us who have been cursed or maybe blessed with a compulsion to worry about our world and our fate, and who cannot find any clue to it in bibles and such like, are bound to react emotionally to an effort like this. It is not 'tragic' in Aristotle's sense, but for a 'purging of pity and terror' I'm not sure I know anything like it.
B000046PVN|5.0|Along with Ben Hur and Empire Strikes Back, Superman must rank with the greatest Romantic soundtracks ever penned.  John Williams is one of the finest film composers alive, and in the late 70's/early 80's we have him in his prime (in a 6 year span of 75' to 81' he wrote Jaws, The Fury, 1941, Jaws 2, Dracula, Close Encounters, Star Wars, Superman, The Empire Strikes Back, ET, and Indiana Jones...!).  This Rhino release is especially noteworthy for the extra versions of the main love theme, in particular the instrumental version of the \\"Flying\\" sequence (sans Margot Kidder's voice over... thank goodness).       This is Williams' masterpiece.
B0000CDL93|5.0|When I saw this film in the theater originally, I thought it was only mediocre. Re-watching it with Oliver Stone's added footage, made it riveting! Oliver Stone said that he thought this film and his film, \\"Nixon\\", are his Godfather Part One and Two. I am in complete agreement with him. This is a spellbinding thriller even if you didn't live through this era.
B00006LLOG|5.0|Argubably better than his first musical effort lou reed reached his peak on transformer. maybe the album was as good as it was simply because bowied pruduced it. The production of yet another brilliat artist did nothing but help. the mellownes especially was magnificent. yes the velvet underground never were exactly high octane musicians but reed simply pulls it of better here.

B0000CABKC|4.0|Somewhat reminiscent of the D.C. sniper slayings, this film concerns a battle-fatigued Special Forces veteran of Kosovo, who has seen far too much violence,and becomes an animal lover and wreaks his vengeance by tracking & killing two hunters in the conifer forests of the Pacific Northwest. He is tracked down reluctantly by his former teacher,and  by other members of the FBI, again reminiscent of the D.C. snipers, with this critical difference: he has been taught to kill in hand- to- hand combat with primitive weapons he makes himself, not modern high-powered rifles. The film is not for the faint-hearted, and starts with 15 minutes of fiery Hollywood battle footage from the Kosovo War, and its ethnic cleansing. The first half of the remainder might be considered slow by some viewers, but the pace picks up considerably in the second half, as the chase begins in earnest, beginning with the military detention vehicle's accident. The subsequent chase scenes through the streets, construction sites,underground tunnels and whitewater rapids surrounding Portland, Oregon are some of the most exciting you will ever see on film, raising this film briefly to a 5-star level.<BR>They culminate is a gruelling hand-to-hand combat between teacher and pupil above some whitewater rapids as the FBI looks on. Second film I have seen in which Del Toro plays a desperate killer on the run, the other being \\"21 Grams\\". He seems to be developing into a Sylvester Stallone-type actor. The film has some other notable touches: the music of Johnny Cash, and how Tommy Lee Jones saves a white dog or wolf from a snare in the film's opening scene and later sees the same dog at the end of the film.

B00011RPB0|1.0|Unlike those who went to see &quot;Lost in translation&quot; because of the ridiculous hype created mostly by the critics, i went to see it because mostly everyone i know who'd seen it was telling me &quot;unless you're looking for a good 2 hours of sound sleep, don't go&quot;..I decided to find out for myself why there were conflicting &quot;reports&quot; about this film. I rarely trust the &quot;critics&quot; but rarely doesn't mean never.<br />    Well, I would have to think and think hard at that, to remember another film which was so hyped and amounted to so much nothingness. Adding more to the mystery is that this thing even won awards.<br />   To keep things short, this is a surreally uninspired script, which employs 2 otherwise very good actors who in turn spend two hours delivering some of the most boring lines i've heard in a long time on film. Supposedly this is an intellectual comedy (now THAT's a joke) but in that case the joke must be on the audience. I found myself grinning a coupla times and basically that was it. Cheap jokes about how the Japanese mispronounce English isn't exactly what i deem &quot;intellectual&quot; for one thing, and for another, tired semi-pick up lines over whiskey doesn't cut it for &quot;humour&quot; as far as I'm concerned either..<BR>  And all this despite being positively biased because i happen to be a big fan of Murray's..<br />    &quot;Lost in Translation&quot; attempts to take a quirky look at two people &quot;trapped&quot; in a mega-lux hotel in Tokyo who while seeing their marriages falling apart are also seeing their lives becoming epmtier and emptier and devoid of &quot;meaning&quot;. What they do about that is wander about hopelessly, meet in the hotel bar, down some drinks and then some more, wander again, meet in the hotel bar and toos back some more drinks and have some seriously empty conversations in the process. <BR>    Uhm, is this supposed to be &quot;deep&quot; or something and if yes in exactly what kind of circles does this pass as deep? Or is it supposed to be &quot;touching&quot; as some other people claimed? Touching? Christ, if all flirting was THAT boring there'd eventually be a law against it.<br />   There was also this other line of argument from people who said that this film is good because of the stark contrast it provides to most of the mindless Hollywood films out there. Ok, I'd be willing to entertain such a noble notion, but this would mean that this film is not mindless. Which it's not, but just because a film raises the IQ bar a mere few points over the general mediocrity it doesn't mean that it automatically becomes intelligent. Lost in Translation wants to be intelligent but it can't. There's no adequate story for the film to &quot;stand&quot; onto and there's no clear premise that this joke of a script has.<br />   I was watching J.Murray in this film thinking that he actually performs good in it because he perfectly reflects the atmosphere of the film: boredom beyond salvage. Yes, he outdoes the audience being bored, but he had an easier job than us. We didn't have to wait hours on set just to say pseudo-intellectual script-lines. If any other actor had been in his place he'd be forced to perform just as good because &quot;Lost in Translation would give him no other choice but look and act bored to utter tears. <br />   Now, more generally speaking, why would i care about some woman (to whom we are given no depth at all) who's  bored because her photographer husband is running about on business leaving her all alone in this lux hotel. I mean, the poor thing!!!! How humdrum!!! Or a millionaire actor with a midlife crisis who's about to cash in a cool two-mill for spending a week in this hotel? I'd take the boredom for that and i wouldn't even expect any mercy from the ones around me if you know what i mean. How could you possibly identify with such paper-thin characters? Totally beyond me...<br />   Lost in Translation will sadly enter way high on the list for one of the most overhyped films in recent memory. And immediately after that it will also proudly enter the list as one of the most mediocre films to win awards in recent time. And then, it will slowly but surely head for oblivion...
B00018D44U|5.0|Feels Like Home is an excellent sophomore effort.    Norah Jones sounds great on all these tracks.  It is clear on this album that Norah has been influenced by all kinds of music like blues, jazz, country, and pop.    Sunrise is a very pretty song about how quickly time goes by.  It is a nice song to wake up to in the mornning.    The song Don't Miss You At All has a silky romantic sound that I enjoyed.  Humble Me is a great song about feeling humbled when nothing is going right in your life.  The Long Way Home is a song about trying to find your own identity and a place you can call home.    Carnival Town is a song that sounds like a lullaby.  It has a slow wistful quality to it.  I enjoyed it though.<br />Creepin in is a lively sounding duet with Dolly Parton.  Their voices sound nice together.  What Am I to You has a nice sassy blues sound to it.  It is one of my favorite tracks.  This song is about wondering if the person you love really loves you.  I love the smooth sound of the song Toes very much.   This song is a example of how Norah sings about the simple joys in life.  I could visualize images of toes touching water and a person swimming with fish as Norah sang this wonderful song.  Norah Jones has a sexy, sultry, seductive voice that makes Feels like Home very enjoyable to listen to. I think her voice conveys a range of emotions on this album like joy, frustration and confusion.    Feels Like Home is a wonderful CD.
6304076517|5.0|Roger Ebert, in one of his most sensible comments, said this film stands outside of criticism, and that's certainly true.  It's just a delight, everytime I see it and hear the words &quot;Bosun! Bosun!&quot; I crack a big grin and settle in for one of the most unusual films ever made.<br />So, after all these years, and with thousands and thousands of DVD's issued for obscure and worthless crappy movies, where in the heck is the DVD for this, a landmark film that would obviously benefit from the treatment?  There must be something going on behind the scenes that is preventing it.
B0001W8Q9Y|5.0|Marillion is an unconventional band.  Their music isn't made for the masses and even the band admit that their fan base is only 100,000 or so strong.  However, we are also an unconventional fan base.  We are responsible for funding this current project, Marbles, and with that in mind, Marillion deliver their most stunning album since &quot;Brave&quot;.  There have been some incredible highlights along the way: songs like &quot;This Strange Engine&quot;, &quot;Interior Lulu&quot;, &quot;House&quot; and &quot;This is the 21st Century&quot; among them, but this is an album that delivers start to finish.<br />Marillion make powerful music.  There is more raw emotion in the opening track, &quot;The Invisible Man&quot;, than you could find listening to an entire afternoons worth of radio.  This album is packed with emotion and incredible musicianship.<br />First and foremost, please go buy the 2 disc Racket records set off the band website.  The extra money pays with big rewards.  &quot;Ocean Cloud&quot; alone is worth the price of the set.  It is one of three epic masterpieces on this album.  &quot;The Invisible Man&quot; and &quot;Neverland&quot; are the others.  But the long songs aren't the only ones worth your while. Though about half the album was instantly appealing, other parts took some closer looks.  I'm a lyric guy, and reading the lyrics before hearing the songs I was wasn't sure how I was going to react to some of the songs.  I wasn't disappointed, and have been rewarded for repeated listenings.  Listening closer to tracks like &quot;Don't Hurt Yourself&quot;, &quot;Angelina&quot;, and &quot;You're Gone&quot; and &quot;Genie&quot; will blow you away with musicianship.  There's a lot going on in these songs and it is all wonderful.<br />Marillion as a band is phenomenal.  And the band members incredible individual contributions make this so.  On this album, everyone is showcased.  Steve Rothery's guitar is more prominent on this album--and this is a wonderfulthing.  His soloing is as emotive as ever, and his work in the background can almost make you forget what is in the foreground.  H's voice is as pure, strong, and heartfelt as it has ever been.  And the oft-undermentioned trio of Mark Kelly on keyboards, Pete Trewavas on bass, and Ian Mosely on percussion are precise and bloody-well perfect throughout this album.<br />There are songs that could find an audience on the radio, and songs that are more for the true fans.  Songs of 12, 13, and 18 minutes (a trademark of Marillion albums) won't find airplay in this world of ADD and instant gratification.  Others could, like &quot;You're Gone,&quot; &quot;Don't Hurt Yourself,&quot; &quot;Genie&quot; and even the gorgeous 7+ minute &quot;Fantastic Place.&quot;  There seems to be something for anyone on this album.<br />I am a Marillion fan and have been since the Fish days.  I love both versions of the band, though I think of them separately.  I'd both love and hate to share what Marillion really is with the world.  Part of me wants to keep it just for myself and those who already get it.  And another part of me wants the world to experience how great a band can be.  Marillion is to music itself what Dave Matthews is to the radio.  You love hearing it because you know it is a cut above anything else out there.  Maybe we will never hear Marillion on the radio.  It doesn't matter.  They are too good for it anyway.<br />Check out Marbles.  It will make your ears a better place.

0451191153|3.0|This is a book you will finish. Not nearly as entertaining as &quot;Atlas Shrugged,&quot; in my opinion. I like Rand's views on individual responsibility and capitalism, but her sneering dislike for anything spiritual leaves me cold. Also, her view of love is rather odd, almost masochistic. I think the main thing I didn't like about this book is the fact that none of the characters is very likeable. Howard Roark, in my opinion, is a rapist and completely amoral...and he's the hero of the book. Sure, he has high standards regarding his work, but his standards in other areas of his life are questionable. Rand also has a habit of being quite unrealistic in some of her writing...Roark's and Dominique's first glance at each other merited a couple of paragraphs regarding how all of a sudden they knew what the other was thinking, how they knew they belonged together, etc. <br />That having been said, the plot is interesting and keeps you wondering what will happen next.  It is for the most part enjoyable and will make you think.

B00005R2IS|5.0|A rookie director, a dirt poor budget, and a no name cast didn't stop Mad Max from becoming one of the most revered action films of all time.  A pre fame Mel Gibson stars as cop Max Rockatansky in a post-apocalyptic future where he, his buddy partner, and his wife and child, try to maintain a sense of civilization while ruthless biker gangs rule the road.  When his family is slaughtered, Max goes over the edge, and the movie manages to get better and better.  MGM has thankfully released Mad Max the way it was meant to be seen on DVD, with the original Australian language track restored in place of the dubbed American accents that were infamously incorporated into the film for years on home video and television.  The stunt work of the film is a definite highlight, as is the young Gibson's performance as the hell bent for vengeance Max.  Two sequels would follow, the first of which entitled The Road Warrior, managed to surpass this film and remains what many consider the greatest action movie ever made.
B0000025ZK|5.0|THIS CD IS AS GREAT AS HIS DEBUT ALBUM AND IS VERY HIGHLY RECOMMENDED.
0385510438|5.0|Grisham is still on top of his game, if you ask me.  Sure, this isn't KING OF TORTS or THE FIRM, but then, it's not supposed to be.  What it is, is a well-written book, blending styles from A PAINTED HOUSE and some other prime Grisham fiction.  No, it's not as fast-paced as some of his other books, but then, we all need to take a break!<br />Also recommended:  Bark of the Dogwood and A Painted House
B000065V1V|5.0|It's kind of common to think that such big artist from the past years tend to slow down through the years... or at least their new productions don't impact as the previous (and nowadays classic) ones... but this album is almost a masterpiece. It shows how Bowie can compose really great music. He can change styles, makeup, band memebers... but he's always making great music. This is one of my favorites albums overall, and I'm not a Bowie fan. Highly recommended.
B00000DFRS|5.0|This one the best albums I say in history, Whitney gave it her all here.. Heartbreak hotel, My love is your love, Its not right but its okay, My favorite one on this record I learn from the best(...)this a must have album.   This was Whitney peak, not that she isnt any good, There wont be anything like this from her again(...)
0451169514|5.0|I've never read a book this long that could hold my interest to the end. The movie leaves out so much that this book has to offer. Such as the gay person being killed and the coke bottle oath. Some may turn away because of the books length. But if you have the patience. This is a masterpiece of your imagination. It was odd reading that all of the boys have sex with the girl at the end so they can make it out of the monsters lair. King is indeed strange.

0694016756|5.0|Having heard lots of parents mention this book as the gold standard in bedtime reading, we purchased it for my 18 month old.  She is a tough cookie to get to sleep, but we have now found a way that works every time.  She absolutely LOVES this book, she picks it out each night before we get her p.j.'s on and tuck her in, then we read it together (three or four times!) before she gets droopy-eyed and yawns herself to sleep.  I even find myself getting mesmerized by the repetition of verse and pictures on the colorful (yet easy on the eye) pages.  The story is simple, the characters few, but my daughter delights in picking out the tiny mouse on each page, in finding the red ballon, the clock, the kittens, mittens, and the bowl of mush.  I recommend the Lap Edition since it is nice and large; our little one looks as though she can step right into the \\"big green room\\" as I read to her on each giant page.  A must have for early childhood reading!
B00006G8HX|3.0|After the perfectly self-contained shot of Trek goodness that was Star Trek II, and before the more lighthearted pure fun of Star Trek IV, Star Trek III stumbled a bit, probably because it was Nimoy's first shot at directing a Trek movie.  Although FAR from a bad movie, it had some real weaknesses:<br />-The pacing was off.  As noted before, sometimes it CRAWLS along.  On the other hand, Nimoy also put together some sharp, effective scenes, foreshadowing the solid job he'd do in Star Trek IV.  It is hardly the nearly unwatchable creep that Star Trek I was at times.<BR>-Although it looked good overall, the Genesis planet falling apart under the cast's feet just looked cheap.  ILM did their usual good effects work in the space scenes, however.<BR>-The plot was kind of weak, insofar as the whole movie was a contrived way to bring Spock back to life after Nicholas Meyer killed him off to great dramatic effect in Star Trek II.<br />In fairness, however, we have to consider the very real upsides to the movie:<br />-Most of the effects hold up very well.  In some respects, they look BETTER than modern CGI, I think because so much real artistic talent went into the model-making and other techniques used.  This is a good looking movie, and the new DVD transfers and sound only make it even better in this respect.<br />-The acting was actually quite good overall, and the cast was clearly having fun playing their characters.  Star Trek is usually not considered an acting tour de force, but compared to the current Star Wars prequels, this cast should have barrels of Oscars.<br />The Special Edition 2-DVD re-releases of the original Star Trek movies are also loaded with oodles of features that make them a great value, unlike the older DVD releases that were very bare-bones.
B00003CXCT|3.0|Now that the official DVD release of George Lucas's visionary epic Star Wars episodes 4, 5 & 6 is here, we regret to bring you the following news....<br /><br />Legions of Rebellion supporters are unhappy to say the least with the exclusion of the original theatrical release vs. just the special edition. There are also some inconsistencies with the soundtrack including dialogue and other obvious changes to characters.<br /><br />You must know that Princess Leia went to great lengths to try and convince George Lucas not to tinker with our story. Millions of petitions were collected from numerous star systems and sent to him with Jedi emissaries Master Yoda and General Qui-Gon Jinn, attempted to exert their influence on a number of occasions in hopes of reaching a diplomatic solution. Secret meetings were held and plans to raise money to fund a release of our own, were dashed when it was discovered that George Lucas's wealth and influence is more powerful than the force. Many have declared him a traitor and a sympathizer to the Empire for his treacherous displays of indifference.<br /><br />\\"Flash\\"! This just in......... Supporters to the Jedi council have just informed us that a small, but elite band of rag tag misfits who call themselves \\"Sisters of C3PO\\", have set out to hunt and destroy Lucas. This small but effective army of droids have been described as being very effeminate & fastidious killing machines, who's primary goal is to wipe out the threat of a maniac who forces his \\"New & Improved\\" vision on us.<br /><br />Recent reports claim that Mr. Lucas has taken flight aboard a star destroyer headed for the hoth system in an attempt to elude any possible assassinations. Our secret inside sources close to the Empire say that this information may be a ruse or ploy to break apart the droids, sending them on false missions while weakening their effectiveness. Some factions of the old rebellion have said that Mr. Lucas intends to resurrect a new senate council, in hopes to bog down efforts to securing any attempt to bring him in for questioning and listening to reason.<br /><br />In a last ditch effort Ewoks were dispatched to Skywalker Ranch to picket with signs like; \\"George Lucas is a scruffy looking nerf herder\\" and \\"George Lucas is Jabbas love child\\", while a small band of Jawas gained access to the production studios and attempted to steal the plans for the DVD release. Unfortunately it ended in disaster with a number of Ewoks and Jawas slaughtered by the Imperial Guard on George's payroll<br /><br />So while we continue to fight the evil genius Darth Lucas in a on going battle to restore artistic freedom to the galaxy... keep your light sabers up and may the force be with you.<br /><br />Obi-Wan Kenobi<br />Editor In Chiefcuring any attempt to bring him in for questioning and listening to reason.

B00005JMJ4|5.0|I can't understand how anyone could bash this movie. It's inspiring and powerful, yet so simple. It is amazing.
B00003CXCD|4.0|ROMAN HOLIDAY should appeal to everyone who loves a good romance, and this one is a great one.  The rest us of will be well content with the splendor of Rome and the chance to see the remarkable Audrey Hepburn in her debut movie.  In other words, ROMAN HOLIDAY has something for every palate.<br />  The plot?  Princess Ann (we're never quite sure which country she's princess of) is enduring a grueling tour of European nations.  Weary to death of the royal treatment, one night Ann escapes into the Roman night.  Unfortunately for her she had a while earlier been given an injection to help her sleep.  The drug takes effect while she's out and about, and reporter Joe Bradley (Gregory Peck) discovers her asleep on a street bench.  Believing she's inebriated, and being a gentleman, he tries to deliver her safely to her home.  That plan fails and, being a gentleman, Bradley arranges for the young stranger (he doesn't learn she's the missing princess until the next scene) to sleep on the sofa in his small, one-room apartment.<br /> Cary Grant was originally offered the part of Joe Bradley and he turned it down.  One of the dvd's specials tells us he refused the role because he didn't want to play second fiddle to an ingenue.  Maybe so.  It's tempting to decide, on the basis of this scene, that Peck was woefully miscast.  Ann, nearly asleep on her feet, asks Bradley \\"Will you help me undress?\\"  A natural enough request coming from royalty, I guess.  Bradley fumbles around with her neck scarf, unties it, hands it to her and says \\"You can handle the rest.\\"<br /> Peck plays the scene for a smile.  Grant would have made it one of the highlights of the movie.  After savoring the opportunity for the audience's delight he would have removed the tie and given the camera a quick peek, as if to say \\"Listen here, I know this is a cliched, silly situation.  But doesn't this look like fun.  Don't we make a handsome couple?\\"  Grant was a supple pagan god who drank more than once from the well of hedonism, and he was always careful to bring the audience along for the good times.  Peck was an Old Testament prophet, a little too stern and stiff to give himself over to pleasure.<br />  What Peck brings to the role is authority and a handsome arm for Hepburn to rest on.  Grant would have distracted us, and ROMAN HOLIDAY is best when our attention is focused squarely on Audrey Hepburn.  She delivers a tour de force performance, and you can understand the excitement she generated even after a half century.<br /> The specials include the documentary \\"Remembering ROMAN HOLIDAY\\", which surprised me with all the people who were involved and dropped out of the production of the movie.  \\"Edith Head: The Paramount Years\\" is a short biography of the famous and talented fashion designer.  \\"Restoring ROMAN HOLIDAY\\" shows us a number of before and after shots - this is a VERY clean print.  There is also a trio of theatrical trailers and a stills photo gallery.hedonism, and he was always careful to bring the audience along for the good times.

B00000DFKF|4.0|Varg really is a genius. Not a fantastic musician, but considering he plays drums, guitar, bass and does vocals, he does pretty well. As a drummer he's good, I like his style, but he plays kinda sloppy here and you can hear mistakes. As a guitarist, he's not technical or fast, but the way he writes this incredibley simple music is just awesome. The feeling he puts into everything is unparalleled by ANY black metal, even Darkthrone. That being said, Burzum is very Celtic Frost influenced, and incorporates Doom Metal into his music. The production is great, you can hear everything ace, except for the bass. One thing I haven't mentioned is the vocals, which are the most original vocals ever. They are unlike anything. Varg screeches and screams with so much feeling.<br />A couple of songs are fillers, but this album is still damn excellent. I like the way some of the songs are catchy aggressive and beautiful in different spots in each song. Overall the song quality os excellent and almost every song is great. You have to get this cd, black metal fan or doom metal fan.<br />Highlights would be Spell of Destruction, War, Crying Orc and My Journey to the Stars. Highly recommended along with all the other Burzum releases.
B000002IGP|5.0|This is one of my all-time favorite CDs. It is the example of 80's hair metal in a nutshell: the makeup and the hairspray, the catchy chorus, the pink Epiphone Explorers. The album kicks off with the heavy Wanted Man, then comes the best hair metal song ever, Your'e In Trouble. Every inch of that song is all hair metal should be. It also has one of the best choruses known to man. Then comes Ratt's only Top Twenty hit, Round And Round. Then all the other songs in their hairsprayed, spandexed glory. The album closes with the cool but rather repetitive Scene Of The Crime. This is one of the greatest albums ever.
B0000AGWJ7|5.0|I love Avenged Sevenfold. Thier fisrt CD was much more punk-orientated. I prefer this one. They have moved more in direction of METAL. This album has it all: Lightning fast drumming with great double-bass-drum beats, lightning fast guitar licks and heavy riffs, angry screaming, emotional singing, and good bass playing. Yes! I am listening to it as I write and it is so great! Overview:<br />Waking the Fallen: 10/10 Powerful. Captivating. Sad. Beautiful. This does not show their talent, though. This two minute song is much like &quot;Miseria Cantare-The Beginning&quot; off of AFI's &quot;Sing the Sorrow.&quot; <br />Unholy Confessions: 9/10 This song is so awesome, but I keep thinking that The Fold can do so much better. Also, the heavily vocaled (sung, not screamed) chorus is gets really old and kinda dumb. Still, pretty amazing for not showing their full talent.<br />Chapter Four: 9/10 Much like &quot;Unholy Confessions,&quot; this does not show their true talent. Shadows' singing is yet so far much more profoud than ever in this CD. Not as much screaming. I hate to say it, but I think he sounds better screaming. Thissong is also catchy, with a heavily sung chorus. Still, the CD has not yet begun its demon-like beauty. That is yet to come. At about four minutes into the song, they do this bend thing with the singing and do get into their true awesomeness. At this point, Gates does a great sweep-like lick! Cool!<br />Remenissions: 10/10 YES! Their talent has begun to be revealed! This is one great song. It has lightning-fast metal and sorrowful, acousticly-accompanied singing.  <br />Desecrate Through Reverence: 10/10 A metal masterpiece! Head slammin, hard-whackin, YEAH! Its so good I can't stand it!<br />Eternal Rest: 10/10 Definately one of the very best songs in the history of metal. It starts with a blistering guitar solo from Gates and turns into one of the best head banging songs ever. THIS IS THE FIRST SONG OF THE HEIGHT OF THE ALBUM!<br />Second Heartbeat: 9.5/10 I would give this song a ten any day if it had not been made much better the first time. This second version is a slower, (though still fast) worse version of the Fold's best song found on a promotional CD for Hopeless Records I think is called Hoplessly Devoted to You, Volume 4.<br />Radiant Eclipse: 10/10 The demonish, eerie opening riff is soon acompanied by the heaviest thing ever. My mind goes crazy when I listen to this! Easily the BEST song on the album. The only setback is the dumb refrain &quot;hope will fall tonight with broken wings.&quot; <br />I Won't See You Tonight part 1: 10/10 great piano playing, greater guitar part. Emotional song that really works. Longest song at about 9 minutes. No screaming. At the end, the song turns really fuzzy until it is pur noise.<br />I Won't See You Tonight part 2: 10/10 Starts off with heavy screaming, which makes a big contrast from part 1. This part is much less emotional and more along the lines of pure awesomeness. Great solo, Gates! <br />Clairvoyant Disease: 9/10 A slow song. Good, but nothing compared to stuff that comes before it. Ends in a cool soft thing.<br />And All Things Will End: 9/10 Great tile, huh? You'd think it would be like a slow, wmotional ending or a really metal ending. Well, it's both! It's kinda in the middle for the beginning, then it gets soft and slow, then metal, then returns to how it was in the beginning. The ending is wierder than anything you've ever heard. There's a normal guitar solo for a while, but if you listen carefully, the backing stuff gets really out of tune. After about thirty seconds, you don't need to listen carefully. It sounds terrible until only the detuned drums are left really slow. Wierd ending.<br />If you love this album, which you will hen you get it, you should also check out this other band called Opeth. Their kinda similar, only with a lot longer songs, less punk, and more transitions between metal and acoustic. Check out my reviews on their CDs too. GET THIS ALBUM!
B00005JMCN|5.0|I don't usually like horse movies. The Horse In The Gray Flannel Suit was more weak than I could bear. But I feel this is one of the best movies ever. I just acn't believe it lost the Academy Award for Best Picture to Lord Of The Rings. I saw them both and this is like 10,000 times better. I love this movie, and you will, too.
B00005NWM3|3.0|OK, to get one thing straight, I usually don't like music that everybody else does because people like stuff that requires no thinking or creativity.  And also, I hate this guitar tone. Overall, this CD really disappointed me. All of the songs had really simple riffs glued together by heavy vocals. Overview:<br />Never Again: 7/10 Not bad. The second best on the album. Flows well. Pretty thoughtful with a set of lyrics that actually mean something, even if what they mean isn't really that good of a topic for me.<br />How You Remind Me: 8/10 Best on the album. Also flows well, but really simple riffs and very heavy on the vocals. I love the little drum fill he does.<br />Woke Up This Morning: 6/10 Not so good. Kinda catchy but very glued.<br />Too Bad: 6/10 Not too bad. Seems to be pretty popular.<br />Just For: 7/10 Angry. Kinda cool, but could be so much better.<br />Hollywood: 5/10 Ooh, the pain. It sucks so bad! So stupidly simple. A ten year old could come up with the main riff in this piece of junk. If the lyrics mean anything, then you must have a great imagination.<br />Money Bought: 5/10 Sooo simple. I could play this sleepwalking in a tar pit by accident. Can't they think of anything better? Yes. Find a different album instead. Still, i can't help but liking the \\"solo\\" in this song. <br />Where Do I Hide: 5/10 Could be worse. (This CD proves that.)<br />Hangnail: 6/10 dumb, yet mildly entertaining. He plays a good harmonic in the bridge.<br />Good Times Gone: 5/10 What is this? a country band? Definately NOT my style. <br />Avoid this album. Amazon is a great place to find all kinds of real good music. Use it to get that music, not this!
B000092ZYX|2.0|I'm interested in good rock music.  I take recommendations, such as these on Amazon, and I make CD selections based on hype.  Radiohead is one of the most heralded bands on the planet, if not THE #1 Rock band.  Why?  I can't figure it out.<br />OK Computer was a terrific album.  It was different.  It was enjoyable.  But everything else Radiohead has done just bores me to death.  Don't get me wrong.  I'm not coming on here to bash Radiohead beacuse I don't like them, and I have something against them.  I honestly can't figure out what the big deal is.  I've found myself listening to their albums, especially this one, over and over again, trying to find something I like.  I can't.  I just can't find something to like.<br />Hail to the Theif... boring.  Mediocre at best.  There is not one song on the album that fully captures my attention.  Radiohead has done this all before, and it's just making me Yawn this time around.  Sorry, it's the truth.  My take on the matter.
B000063147|5.0|OK, this CD is amazing, but isn't quite as good as the Fold's second one. BUY THEM BOTH! This album has more of a punk feel to it. The singing is not as good or refined, but, to tell you the truth, I don't think Shadows has a very good voice in the first place. Also, the guitar tone has less bass, which I kinda prefer. Overview:<br />To End the Rapture: 9/10 This 1-and-a-half-minute long song is really cool in that it has a good guitar solo, then some catchy vocals. It's a great start, but I do feel that it doesn't show who they really are in this album.<br />Turn the Other Way: 10/10 Now this shows who they are. Awesome! This is one fast, metal-crazy song with lots of screaming and some good singing. The guitar is especially noteworthy. There are some great harmonics and the whole thing just falls into place. Definately one of the greatest on the CD. It ends by fading the drum, bass, and guitar tracks, leaving the strings to stay alive.<br />Darkness Surrounding: 10/10 Super fast. Really cool. Great drumming. He does some pretty amazing stuff on the toms followed by some really awesome double-bass-drumming. Good vocals, too, especially at the end, &quot;smell the burning amber&quot;<br />The Art of Subconcious Illusion: 10/10 Cool lyrics. This song just kinda begins out of nowhere with no intro, but is so strong through the whole thing. At one point, Shadows just like screams his vocal chords of his neck, wraps them around his eyeballs and screams if you know what I mean. It's like this awesome, high-pitched scream like he's undergoing what he's singing about or that the lyrics are really happening. Also, at one point, he hits this note that sounds a lot like Godsmack. Awesome.<br />We Come Out at Night: 9/10 Very great, just not as good as the rest. Catchy vocals and memorable guitar riffs.<br />Lips of Deceit: 10/10 The beginning minute alone gives it a ten. Something about it is so cool. The verses are choppy in a wierd, unusual, and memorable way. There's alsoa part where it's kind of a bass solo. Ash is really good. Really great song that ends suddenly.<br />Warmness on the Soul: 10/10 Most definately the most beautiful Sevenfold song. For half of the song, it's just the piano and vocals. All brilliant musicians make great love songs. This is the Fold's shot at it. They have succeeded. It has a great piano solo and a great guitar solo. This is the most memorable song on the album.<br />An Epic of Time Wasted: 10/10 This is one of the first Sevenfold songs I ever heard and I fell in love with it. I can remember every little drum fill and guitar lick they do. The song has several long segments to it that are all together. The first half is a series of angry segments with really great music. Then the whole thing turns around as Shadows says he's sorry. This really is a musical masterpiece that even rivals with some Opeth songs.<br />Breaking Their Hold: 9/10 A very short song, which usually peeves me, but those are some great riffs. All screaming, no singing.<br />Forgotten Faces: 9/10 Really good. Cool drumming at one point.<br />Thick and Thin: 10/10 This is one of my favorites, but it doesn't stand out like some of the others, besides that one little break with some really fast picking.<br />Streets: 9/10 Much less progressive. I've heard it a billion times, but I don't get tired of it. I think it's about drugs. Catchy music that I've memorized. It really is great. <br />Shattered by Broken Dreams: 8/10 Starts off melodic, which is really great, and the screaming kicks in after two minutes. I dunno, this song really isn't very good, but it really kicks off for a while. It stops, and you expect it to be over, but then it just starts up again. This is not the best work of the Fold. It ends in a major chord. What are they thinking? (I hate to say it, but this is the longest song at about 7 minutes. In Waking the Fallen, the songs get a bit longer.)<br />This CD is very close to being a perfect work of the Fold. See my reviews found elsewhere in Opeth, Metallica, and many more.
B00000JLWW|2.0|One of the most spectacular movies ever released on DVD and not anamorphic.  What gives?  I give the movie 4 stars overall, but probably 1 star for technical delivery.
0679745203|5.0|The English Patient is a work of great prose by the brilliant Michael Ondaatje. The book is hypnotizing in style. The characters are haunted with their dreadful pasts. They are slowly uncovering the wounds of their pasts while getting used to the quieter ambiance following the Second World War. The English Patient is an absorbing novel of war, honor, romance, and courage. The parts written in the point of view of the English patient while under the effects of morphine are strenuous, but lyrical, dense, and fascinating.
B0001Z36PK|5.0|If you don't know about The Divine Comedy, you can probably use &quot;Scott Walker meets Jimmy Webb and Kirsty McColl in  Marselles and after a few glasses of absinthe they all decide to put on the show right here&quot; as a rough guide. <BR>Fortunately, they had another huge talent along to help them. Neil Hanlon (himself the font from which The Divine Comedy flows) knows exactly how to put together a fine story with a fine tune, and then back it up with a fine production.<br />It would be wrong for me not to admit that I only just discovered  them. But on the basis of  many listenings to this LP and a bit of a live gig in Ireland, I'm  writing this review to  urge you to buy Absent Friends. It will make you smile, then laugh - but Neil Hanlon's deadpan delivery and tongue in both cheeks doesn't stop this record from fiddling with your heartstrings as well.<br />Though he lays it on a bit thick on a couple of tracks, his candid admiration for old-style songs - standards, numbers from the classic musicals, pert sixties pop - combines with faux-lite lyrics (which paint  quirky pictures a damn sight better than most writers' efforts) to make a near-perfect  bunch of aural delights.<br />Some favourites: Come Home, Billy Bird, a breathtaking hour in the life of a born-again businessman; The Wreck of the Beautiful, a vignette of childhood loss; Happy Goth, so cool you want to hug the next   teenage Siouxsie clone you see; Imaginary Friend, because Todd Rundgren is a great guy  to pay homage to; Freedom Road, a small gem of a trucker's tale, and Charmed Life, whose soaring bridges convinced me that  Hanlon 's songwriting life, at least,  is a charmed  one.

B00005V1Y0|3.0|I've never really been a great fan of Baz Luhrmann's. Moulin Rouge was also a 3 out of 5 rating, in my opinion. I think it must be his style of cinematography - its neither theatre nor film, its halfway in-between... but I'm like this : If I watch a film I want to see a film, and if I want to watch a musical, I go to the theatre. Still, I gave this a shot after reading lots of glimmering reviews about it here. What I can say is this : the dancing was spectacular, and I love dancing, so that was why I gave this movie 3 stars. Apart from that, its just a run-of-the-mill love story... The lush prop sets and costumes might be a main attraction for some who loved this film enough to give it 5 out of 5, but I tend to look for something original and a bit different in a movie, and this just wasn't it.
B0000AI44Q|5.0|It took me a couple of listenings to figure out that this is a thematic concept album.  And then I got addicted and I listened again and again until I think I figured out the whole picture. But even now, it is still rewarding to listen to.<br />Unlike the &quot;rock operas&quot; of the 60s and 70s, this one isn't cheesy at all. Instead, it is earthy and emotionally accurate.  Like his other great works (Powder Finger for example), Young doesn't walk you through a story-line, instead he sings around the story allowing it to slowly come together.<br />I don't usually gush like this about an album but Greendale really is exceptional. <br />It's true Neil Young, though. Not everyone likes his voice and he plays his guitar hard. <br />If you're and old fan fan but kind of quit following him, this is a really great one to buy and catch up on this enduring and very talented musician.
B000002I8D|5.0|This solo Debut album from one of the world's best singers is what brought him to the front seat of the American charts and for many reasons: This album is magnificent.<br /> &quot;In The Air Tonight&quot; is the most memorable classic of his entire career and it's still one of my favorite songs of his even to this very day, more than 23 years since it was riding high on the charts but the rest of this album should not be discounted.<br /> &quot;I Missed Again&quot; is a magnificient pop classic worthy of deserving a place on the &quot;Hits&quot; CD which it didn't make it to but oh well.<br /> This album has a very angry and sometimes sad tone but it's still a fun CD to listen to and I still love it to this very day.

B0001L3LUE|5.0|The Fog of War is basically a well-packaged two hour interview with Robert McNamara, the subject of this feature because of his position of Secretary of Defense under Kennedy and Johnson.  It is a captivating glimpse into a man who served in America`s most important war of the 20th century (WWII) and helped build its most infamous.  <br />While the subject of this film is clearly McNamara's role in and reflection of Vietnam, filmmaker Errol Morris begins his piece by sculpting the life of the now 85 yr old former wiz-kid.   The film traces his role as a strategic analyst for bombing raids against Japan, his short stint as President of Ford Motors and his eventual place alongside Kennedy and Johnson.  We also get to see some personal moments about him, such as his claim to be the person who selected Kennedy's gravesite at Arlington.    But Morris does not get side-tracked giving us too much irrelevant information; his piece is clear and to the point.  <br />The film attempts to place McNamara in the position of a sage-like wiseman, who near the end of his life can educate the rest of us on the lessons that should be drawn from his successes and failures.    Make no mistake, the film clearly attacks the logic behind the Vietnam War (and war in general) and even gives McNamara the chance to pass the buck to Kennedy and Johnson.  But I find a refreshing attempt at truthfulness in this film that is usually lacking from most political texts aimed at persuasion.  <br />While I disagree with many of the conclusions the film wants its audience to embrace, I can`t deny the skill of the filmmaker who has given the world a piece of history that should be cherished forever.  Nothing is more historically relevant than to hear tapes of McNamara`s conversations with Kennedy and Johnson, two strong-willed men whose fearless determination is noticeably absent from the leaders of their political party today. <br />It is impossible for me to review any political documentary in 2004 without comparing it to this era's most famous documentarian, Micheal Moore.  Errol Morris's The Fog of War is what I consider a true documentary (a claim I cannot make about Moore's works).  His film attempts to display the truth of the situation he sees, rather than the tricky way Moore tries to shape the world to fit his views.   Moore could learn a lot by viewing the powerful works of Errol Morris.  The two men get to the same conclusion about war, but Morris does have to resort to half-truths and outright lies to prove his point.   Compared to true documentaries like this, Moore's works are shown to be what they really are: entertainment.
B0001Z53AQ|2.0|Eminem, Swifty, Proof, Kuniva, Kon Artis, and BIZARRE(my man!) of the Dirty Dozen are back, and this time, they're takin' over the world! But just how well is their &quot;worldwide domination&quot; going to be? I mean, is their new album really that good, so good that it would consume listeners like me to support their reigning cause? Speaking as a fan to their music, it isn't. And the result of this album is much more disappointing than I had anticipated.<br />D12 decided to take a much more &quot;serious&quot; approach with &quot;D12 World&quot;, avoiding the goofy and in-your-face antics that was from their last album, &quot;Devil's Night&quot;(which was also so damn good about them, too) That approach goes both ways, but ultimately it leads to the album's downfall. Well, the group has done a good job being more recognizable. Since their last album, people seem to remember more about Eminem than the others of the group, let alone knowing their names(can anyone even remember the names of 50 cent's G-unit posse?). Not to say that all changes with this album, but the group make a statement of that, thanks to this hot single, &quot;My Band&quot;. The track is not only funny from the witty lyrics and background(and who can argue about the 'my salsa' part at the end of the song?), but also informative on how Eminem seems to get more cred and attention than his posse in the past; fortunately, that isn't the only good track. There's &quot;Git Up&quot;, which is great startup with the whole album; good beats, good sound, nice flow when Eminem is rapping at the intro. On with the goods is the fast-paced &quot;Get My Gun&quot;, and &quot;B*tch&quot;, which has some hot beats and a catchy chorus.<br />Now with the bad that makes this album unforgivable. &quot;D12 World&quot; isn't a terrible album, but it does have one of the worst music backgrounds I've ever listened to. Mostly keyboard, guitar and bass works, it varies with all of them combined to just percussions by all tracks. They were too soft, mostly child's play, and I don't see myself breaking my neck for tracks such as &quot;Loyalty&quot; &amp; &quot;How Come.&quot; &quot;40 ounce&quot; tries to prove how hardcore and rough the group is. The only thing it proves is the redundancy of the chorus and its all-too-familiar song structure; it's like a typical Ludicris song, but less on the booty action and more on the binging action. &quot;Leave Dat Boy Alone&quot;...somebody should've leave dat cheesy track alone on the cutting room floor. Well, &quot;I'll be damned&quot;, that track sucks as well, not to mention, SLOW and hypnotic(seriously, I felt like a brain-dead doll banging my head in-key with this track). &quot;American Psycho II&quot; with B-real is a much inferior track compare to the original, and I know BIZARRE can do better with &quot;Just Like U&quot;; what happened to the nasty guy that &quot;drop out of school, take drugs, and molest (rhymes with 'klutz')?&quot;<br />Like the previous album where it introduced Obie Tribe, &quot;D12 World&quot; introduced a new member of the Shady family, named Young Z, courtesy of &quot;Commercial Break.&quot; After listening to his freestyle verse, I'm not sure if it's the music or the rapper himself, his introduction didn't impress me like Obie's. I wanted to say the same for this cat, Bugz from &quot;Bugz 97&quot;, but after knowing more about his short life in &quot;Good Die Young&quot;, plus the TV resource that he's the &quot;lost&quot; member of D12, I at least give some respect for the departed. Speaking of &quot;Good Die Young&quot;, tribute songs are always good to remember a lost friend, but please, Dirty Dozen, spare your own member some eternal peace and don't sing...ever.<br />&quot;D12 World&quot; could've been a great album, 'cause the group's mature image seems to prove it(...well, at least Eminem stop talking about all that mother-hating and wife-killing nonsense); now if only the group mix their new imagery with their old raunchy style. Too bad I've got an album that doesn't crack me up, it was too long of a snooze fest, and surprisingly enough, their risqu&eacute; lyrics were toned down compare to &quot;Devil's Night&quot;; this is how serious the group is? I'm not saying they are soft(no way that I'm sayin' that in front of them), the group just lost their edge, and they need to get their edge back if they're thinking of making a third album, or else their world will be in anarchy.their old raunchy style.

B0000AQS0F|5.0|I know a lot of Sci-Fi fans love this show. Let me tell you, I'm not a big Sci-Fi fan. Star Trek makes me sleep. But this is much, much, much different. A sense of humor that appeals to sick folks like me, and enough sweetness for sentimental sick folks like me. Better than anything on the tube now.
B000148KK2|1.0|Just like Harry Connick Jr, Robert Gordon, Tony Bennett(Playin' with my friends, and KD lang duet cd), Brian Setzer, BB KIng(Eric Clapton duet cd) and even Jane Monheit, she SOL OUT!!!  I knew when she married a rock star things would change, and Diana knows a gold mine wehn she see's one, too bad she coudl have been the next Ella Fitzgerald... she BLEW it big time.  These sonsg are not timeless, but I know she is trying to do something like Norah Jones, but people are to used to her doing classy thinsg like Nat Cole tributes, each cd she releases seems to be gettign more and more commercial.  However the cd Look of love was her last exellent one.  OK Diana now to make up for this awful cd, you owe us a Fats Waller Songbook, tribute to Fats Waller, you can sing obscure Fats tunes like A Porter's Lovesong to A Chambermaid...  skip this one, and cross your fingers...  seems there wil lnever be a young jazz singer, who won't sell out... too bad
B000148KK2|1.0|Every major artist goes through this phase. They sell a lot of product for the label and then they pretty much get to do whatever they want - at least one time. Springsteen had his Nebraska album. To this day when he plays that garbage in concert everybody takes it as a cue for a restroom break. The seats empty quickly and then they come back in when he returns to his good stuff. Diana Krall is essentially doing the same thing in the jazz context. She had to get this out of her system. Of course the added irritant of Costello didn't help.I'm sure that the very talented lady will eventually come to her senses and return to Gershwin, Porter, Kern and success.Up until now I purchased all her CDs. I'll pass on this one.
B00001OH82|5.0|If you understand anything about Bowie you'll know that he's always been an innovator in music. I've been a Bowie fan since I was a young teen (I'm almost 40 now). I've owned most of his albums in some capacity give or take a few. I believe Tin Machine was a great direction that Bowie took. It's unfortunate that he only did 2 albums. One thing about Bowie is he's constantly taken different musical directions throughout his career. Some were liked by many others we're not. Tin Machine received way too much criticism by fans and musicans as well. It's great stuff as far as I'm concerned. Good solid music but you may need to listen a few times and allow it to grow on you (I had to at first). I strongly reccomend if you buy TM 1 you also buy TM 2 as both are great. The music on TM 2 is a little brighter and more up beat than TM 1 and I must admit I prefer the second release over the first. It would be nice to see Bowie go back one day and do a TM 3 although that's about as likely to happen as the return of Ziggy Stardust (In our dreams maybe).
0790731452|2.0|I've watched &quot;Mars Attacks&quot; several times and each time I watch it, I like it less and less.  It's like Tim Burton had a party, invited Jack Nicholson, Annette Bening, Pierce Brosnan, Glen Close and Martin Short and said, Wouldn't it be funny if we made a camp movie together, something in the sprit of those great Science Fiction films form the 50's and 60's?  We'll patch in a few other stars, oh, say Sarah Jessica Parker, Joe Don Baker, and Jack Black and take a stab at it...what do you say?<br />Well, I'm sure it sounded like a good idea at the time.  Put a bunch of likable Hollywood veterans together in a goofy Sci-Fi spoof and people will come.  But the script never got beyond the napkin upon which it was probably outlined.<br />The film makes an attempt at dark comedy and fails miserably.  Are the aliens supposed to be funny? Brutal? Both? They turn out to be less than humorous.  Then there's the actors.  You really don't care about any of them.  Sure, they're played out as mean-spirited and selfish themselves...but who cares?  I wound up not caring if any of them lived or died.  I think the point was to have these Martians blast each of these miserable SOBs, as we viewers cheered them on, but it didn't seem to matter one way or the other.<br />On the other hand, the Martians are done up really well.  The expressions, the eye movements, the flappy little cheek appendages were all done well.  But like the recent Star Wars movies, CGI will only carry a film so far.  Ultimately, this one fails.  On a grading scale from &quot;A&quot; to &quot;F,&quot; this is a solid &quot;D.&quot;
B0001CCXY8|3.0|This cd pretty much is exactly like gore obsessed not musically, but how tiring it gets after awhile. i listened to it enough to give it a good chance. I love the cd, but after 6 or 7 times I really didnt want to listen to it anymore.
B00003XB8K|3.0|Egads...has \\"O Fortuna\\" not been sampled enough already? Appears not, as Enigma tosses it in his fourth album to the point of distraction. This is the least ingenuitive of the Enigma albums, and his most obvious. I'll admit, \\"Push The Limits\\" and \\"Modern Crusaders\\" are the best songs here, but if you have the first three Enigma CD's you have them all.<br />I have often thought Enigma to be a later day Alan Parsons, trying to make his formula fit certain ideas and themes. And like Parsons, once he got past \\"Eve,\\" the formula began to wear thin. The same can be said about \\"The Screen Behind The Mirror.\\" You like the formula. you'll like the album. But to me, it's just Enigma's craftsmanship on display this time. Without heart, craftsmanship is just learning to use the tools, and without any discernable effect.
B00004X0Q0|5.0|Put quite simply, this is an absolutely incredible album. The way it conveys emotions just through raw musical power AND intelligence is amazing. These guys represent what is to come for music: total artistic freedom, the way it was supposed to be in the first place. Everyone who enjoys, plays or respects any form of music should listen to this.<BR>Its so sad but also good in a way that they broke up; it would have been even worse if they had broken the mainstream and been manipulated by major labels and money. <BR>Nirvana? Rolling Stones? The Beatles? No. In my opinion ATDI beat the socks off them all musically, ideologically, and originality.
B0000AXE8I|4.0|Director: Larry Wachowski, Andy Wachowski<BR>Cast:  Keanu Reeves, Laurence Fishburne, Carrie-Anne Moss, Jada Pinkett.<BR>Running Time:  132 minutes.<BR>Rated R for violence, language, and mild sexual situations.<br />When \\"The Matrix\\" hit the big screen in 1999, it was the most innovative special effects triumph Hollywood had ever produced.  With the sequel, \\"The Matrix Reloaded\\", the Wachowski brothers have actually succeeded in making a second film in the series that is just as exciting, equally as thought-provoking, and perhaps possessing even better special effects.  Can anyone say \\"The Empire Strikes Back\\"?<br />\\"The Matrix Reloaded\\" takes the audience through a roller-coaster ride from the last-standing city of civilization in Zion to the Matrix, which is a computerized database consisting of humans who are programmed to fuel its very existence.  As the Matrix strives to become more powerful and absolutely take over Earth, Zion attempts to stage war against the evil technological machine empire, using the messiah-like Neo (Reeves) as their catalyst.  What ensues is a spectacle of rip-roaring sequences of more kung-fu fighting than a Bruce Lee movie, a twelve-minute highway chase scene that perhaps may be the best action scene ever produced, and several superb battles between Neo and the evil Mr. Smith.<br />There a few portions of the narrative that seem to be illegitimate, such as the possible love story between Morpheus (Fishburne) and a previous interest played by Jada Pinkett's character, as well as the overused metaphor of love, specifically between Neo and Trinity (played by Moss).  While \\"Reloaded\\" does not suffer from these developed themes, they seem to provide a symbolism that the Wachowski brothers are trying to convey, but they are so wrapped up in showing off their CCI effects that they are lost for exactly what they want to show the audience.  What made the original \\"Matrix\\" so captivating was the expectance of the unexpected, while what makes \\"Reloaded\\" so enjoyable is that we get what we expect, and it is thrown at us like an asteroid colliding with earth.
0142000663|5.0|I'd highly recommend this book.  I've read other works by John Steinbeck such as East of Eden (not a favorite), The Pearl and Of Mice and Men (liked both), but the Grapes of Wrath is a favorite.  I was deeply moved by the Joad family story.  Despite their hardships, injustices, and loss of family, they press on hoping for a better life and willing to work for it.  There are some good lessons learned in their story.
B00004YA66|3.0|Director:  Gregory Hoblit<BR>Cast:  Dennis Quaid, Jim Caviezel, Andre Braugher, Elizabeth Mitchell, Noah Emmerich.<BR>Running Time:  118 minutes.<BR>Rated PG-13 for language and violence.<br />Dennis Quaid and Jim Caviezel both give fine performances in this quirky science-fiction drama that combines &quot;Back to the Future&quot; and &quot;The Field of Dreams&quot;.  The film opens in the year 1969, with fire-fighter Dennis Quaid first introducing the game of baseball (specifically the Amazin' Mets of that season) to his son, John.  Fast-forward to thirty years later, in which John (Caviezel) is a lonesome, washed-ed ex-college baseball great turned cop who stumbles upon his deceased father's old ham radio.<br />One night, John uses the radio to connect with a man in the area, later discovering that he is talking to his father in the past.  When the father avoids death in a fire that was supposed to take his life, John realizes that he can use this uncanny communication to help him with a serial killer murder case.  The two join forces to change the course of history in order to save the lives of the killer's next victims.<br />Clever premise certainly works for the most part, although there are some twists that do not seem to fit.  Hoblit uses the theme of baseball as the connecting link between the father and son, which is an overdone aspect in modern film; however, the script is smart and swift, making &quot;Frequency&quot; a film worth the while.
B0000020C4|5.0|With Lea Salonga, Michael Ball and Colm Wilkinson this recording has three of the best musical-singers ever. My favourite Les Miz recording of the six I have.
B0001BKAEY|3.0|Director:  The Wachowski Brothers.<BR>Cast:  Keanu Reeves, Laurence Fishburne, Carrie Anne Moss, Jada Pinkett, Hugo Weaving.<BR>Running Time: 128 minutes.<BR>Rated R for violence and language.<br />While the first two &quot;Matrix&quot; films revolved around the splendid special effects and exceptional kung-fu action that could be presented on a visual screen, &quot;The Matrix Revolutions&quot; is much more plot driven and metaphorically focused.  As far as if it is a fitting end to the trilogy, it depends on what the audience is looking for.  If the audience wants some sort of resolution as far as whether Zion survives the attack of the machines and if the Matrix is destroyed, then perhaps the trilogy is complete; however, if the audience is looking for a concise, clear-cut ending...not so fast.<br />The story takes place approximately moments after &quot;Reloaded&quot; ended.  Neo, played by Keanu Reeves in perhaps his best performance of the three films, finds himself in an in-between world in which he has to return in order to save Zion from destruction.  Morpheus and Trinity (Fishburne and Moss, respectively) come to the rescue, but there are bigger problems.  Mr. Smith (Weaving) has used the Matrix as his playing field to create thousands of Smith Agents, all of which are going to be used to destory not only Zion, but all of mankind as well.  Thus, the much expected colassal clash between Neo and Smith--and they certainly do not disappoint.<br />Without the incredible kung-fu scenes and amazing chase sequences, &quot;Revolutions&quot; seems more like &quot;Aliens&quot; in a coma.  There is a pivotal thirty minute segement of the film in which Zion battles the machines, but the Wachowski brothers fail to cut back to Neo and his mates during the whole period.  These battles scenes are entertaining, but they are not what made the first two films enjoyable.  Obviously, the story is essential--but the script is so torn between either portraying this powerful, faithful metaphor of the Bible or emphasizing crazy, out-of-your-seats, karate-fighting, plane exploding, human flying, building-destroying outrageousness.<br />Overall, &quot;Revolutions&quot; is the weakest of the trilogy because of the Wachowski brothers' attempt to sneak in symbolism into a film series that was certainly entertaining enough without it.  &quot;The Matrix&quot; was filled with wonder and special effects, &quot;Reloaded&quot; had perhaps the best action sequence ever recorded on film, yet there is nothing that special or memorable about &quot;Revolutions&quot;.  It is not a film that is going to change a person's life or faith--it will satisfy those who are fans of the series.
0451169514|5.0|I've read this book at least 15 times - at least 7 of which were consecutive &quot;summer reads&quot;.  A wonderful blend of horror, typical King humor, and suspense, it never seems to drag at all.  If seeing the tv-movie turned you off of picking up the book - forget about the movie.  There's so much in the book that can not be put into any format other than print that a great deal was lost in the switch to the screen.
079073639X|3.0|Director:  Barry Levinson<BR>Cast:  Dustin Hoffman, Samuel L. Jackson, Sharon Stone, Liev Schrieber.<BR>Running Time:  144 minutes.<BR>Rated PG-13 for violence and language.<br />The success of Michael Crichton's &quot;Jurassic Park&quot;, &quot;The Lost World&quot;, &quot;Congo&quot; (well, not so much), and his &quot;E.R.&quot; television series caused Hollywood studio executives to swallow up any undisturbed pieces of his work that had not yet been brought to the big screen.  Enter : &quot;Sphere&quot;, featuring an all-star cast, a top-notch drama director, and a self-destructing story line that eventually ruins a beautifully made, well-acted science fiction romp.<br />When a three-century old space vessel is found at the bottom of the ocean, the government sends its most intelligent, qualified individuals to study the vessel in order to determine why it is at the bottom of the body of water and what happened to it.  Dustin Hoffman (a psychologist), Samuel L. Jackson (a mathematician), and Sharon Stone (a biochemist) star as they individuals who investigate the mysterious ship.  They discover a strange, otherworldly Sphere in the center of the craft, not knowing its purpose or what it does.  What they later find out is that the Sphere can alter their thoughts, perceptions, and desires, manipulating their every move.  The team turns against themselves and the abandoned ship becomes the stage for deception, mystique, and terror.<br />The first half of &quot;Sphere&quot; is superb, as Levinson unravels the plot swiftly and latches onto the audience using his marvelously constructed cast; however, the second half of the film lags and the final payoff is neither powerful or suspenseful.  The entire cast gives fine performances, the special effects are quite good, but overall this adaptation of the popular Crichton novel does not live up to the hype.  Not a complete disappointment; should have been a much more enchanting, enjoyable suspense sci-fi thriller.
B00005N9CV|3.0|An interesting middle of the road attempt at Bossa Nova, without quite connecting.  But S'Wonderful is -- although credit should be given to Joao Gilberto's Amoroso 1977 album where S'Wonderful and Besame Mucho originated.  Not a coincidence that Claus and Tommy were arranger and co-producer on Amoroso.  Try the original and see how much Miss Krall admires Mr Gilberto.
6305546789|5.0|Director:  John Carpenter<br />Cast:  Jamie Lee Curtis, Donald Pleasance, Nancy Loomis, P.J. Soles, Charles Cyphers.<br />Running Time: 93 minutes.<br />Rated R for violence, language, and mild sexual situations.<br />Perhaps the quintessential horror film of the 1970s, which created a spring-board of imitations, remakes, and recycles for nearly two decades after.<br />The film opens with perhaps the third most-historic horror film music of all time (behind \\"Psycho\\" and \\"Friday the 13th\\", of course) and the audience views the horrific slaying of a teenager daughter through the eyes of the killer, young child Michael Myers.  Myers is shipped off to a mental institution in which he is counseled by Dr. Loomis (Pleasance) for 15 years.<br />While trying to move Myers from the institution to a maximum security prison, Michael escapes from the hospital and returns to his hometown for a murdering spree.  The film introduces Jamie Lee Curtis in her first role, playing a normal high-school babysitter who is stuck watching children on Halloween instead of partying with her friends on the holiday.  As Myers attempts to kill again, Dr. Loomis tries to race against time to stop him.  Eventually, Myers and Curtis cross paths and the rest is history.<br />Carpenter is a modern Hitchcock, transforming a normal neighborhood into a slashing frenzy of terror and macabre.  He uses many different foregrounds and an atmospheric tension instead of blood and guts for his scares.  The exceptional musical score accompanies Myers every move and really adds to the suspense of this extraordinary, yet simple piece of cinematic terror at its very best.  Pleasance is stylish and swift in his performance, while Curtis's breakout role makes her the true queen of all scream queens.  \\"Halloween\\" is a true horror masterpiece, no matter how obsolete some may think it to be.
B000096I9G|5.0|ok, yes it's true that the songs aren't the same as on the albums. in this case that's not necessarily a bad thing. when songs are played live hundreds of times, you have to expect some variation and improvisation.<br /><br /> visually, the dvd is rather.. quiet. The Cure has never been known as a particularly rocking band as far as a stage show, rather the songs are deep and moving all on their own. the visual cuts and blurs during the Pornography set are quite good though.<br /> sonically, it's amazing. having only heard The Cure on studio CDs, hearing and seeing them live is quite an experience. the energy and passion put into the songs live, is simply breathtaking.<br /> while all three sets are very good, for me the Pornography set stands out. listening to it, i heard some of the most amazing sounds i've ever heard in a song. to say that's it's not like the album is something like saying A Clockwork Orange, the film, wasn't quite as good as A Clockwork Orange, the literary work. they're both masterpieces in respective mediums.<br /> simply put, if you like the Cure even a little, do pick up this DVD. you won't regret it.
1401902197|5.0|Louise Hay is an inspirational lady that I admire. I listen to her CD in my car everyday instead of listening to the radio or music. It is an incredible way of realizing how fortunate we are in life. Most importantly that we can create anything we want in life. Good or bad. It is a choice. Louise helps to make the right choices and to believe. Afterall, she never finished high school and came from an abused home. Look at her success. One day I hope I am fortunate enough to meet her.
B000089RVX|5.0|Their songs are so haunting and melodious, and so is Amy Lee's voice! Heh heh.  I like their music from Fallen because it doesn't get annoying and painful to listen to, which is what happens with punk and metal.  There's just enough rock and cool electric guitar solos to make me happy.  And it's definitely not pop, which makes me happy too.  I love the fact they're capable of producing such beautiful songs like &quot;My Immortal&quot; and &quot;Anywhere,&quot; without destroying the melody with bad singing and lack of emotion.  <br />If you can find their older music on the net, I suggest you listen to them.  They're really impressive.  &quot;Anywhere&quot; is one of the most beautful songs I've heard, and &quot;Before the Dawn&quot; and &quot;So Close&quot; are very haunting. You might know this, but &quot;My Immortal&quot; and &quot;Whisper&quot; were already recorded songs on another Evanescence cd before Fallen.  They've tweaked them a little for Fallen, but all versions are good.<br />Although some songs sound alike, if you know their other songs, you'll know they're capable of much more, with just as much, if not more, skill.  Besides, if they're good, and you find yourself listening to them regularly, then they're good enough, right?  It'll be interesting to see what they come up with next.  I hope it's soon.
B00005JLR8|4.0|This one slipped be me as I sifted through muddy waters of hollywood. But when i went back I found this piece of gold. Please dont make the mistake I did by branding this a movie about some immigrants living in America. When you look at it like that it just becomes a lesson out of a history book. The Irish family of four comes to America escaping the death of their only son which is ?caused? by a fall down the stairs and strickens the young parents with grief and guilt. The family looks to &quot;the man who screams&quot; (Mateo), thier neighbor, for some vitality in life. Ironically, Mateo himself is battling for his own life.  Some critics said this was too emotional. I say get out of your little bubble of comfort. Breathtaking performances by each of the four family members, but the real life sisters that played the daughters make Mary Kate and Ashley look like a sick joke. This is Gold!
B00005JMEW|5.0|Crazy, hilarious, sexy, action-packed, and even artistic!!  This describes Kill Bill vol.1 .  Pretty much devoid of gentler emotions (save that for volume 2, which is also excellent, but for different reasons), this movie is just a feast for the eyes!  Two hours of non-stop action and fun, what more do theater-goers or Hd-Tv owners need?  A thrilling soundtrack plays wonderfully against the blood, taunts, sweat, death, and...cheers?  From the audience, of course, who are sitting on the edge of their seats, staring with awe at the massacre going on in front of them, and finding it grossly amusing.  Indeed, the gory parts are so over-accentuated (that was Tarantino's intent), that they (partly) cease to be disgusting.  Instead, Tarantino focuses on making the movie as cool as it can be, directing a great cast who really knows what they're doing - entertaining!<br />I REALLY enjoyed the dialogue.  Some of it was ridiculous, but fun nonetheless.  Verbal sparring (go Hattori Hanzo and his bald friend!!) and character interactions not in the form of violence were very appropriate in context, and shed light on the actual character of the characters, which was definitely useful.  Favorite character is The Bride of course, but I really found GoGo amusing.  Too bad they cut out the part with her sister trying to avenge her death (\\"Yuki's Revenge\\"), that would've been crazy fun.  <br />So, as you can see, I enjoyed this movie very much.  I can say the same for the excellent soundtrack (in the movie itself, because some great songs were left out on the CD).  If you're not grossed out easily, watch this incredible movie!  And the second one too, because it reveals the depth of all the characters...those remaining alive, that is.

B0001CCXGG|4.0|What's good about it?<br />It's tough to evaluate a live CD that comprises of three guys that are known for performing instrumentals.  Let's face it; you know that their performances will be flawless and loaded with plenty of improvised guitar soloing.  Joe Satriani starts things off with the hard and heavy track &quot;The Extremist.&quot;  You can recognize instantly that it's Satch.  He keeps the pace going with &quot;Crystal Planet,&quot; which comes from the album of the same name (an underrated album that contains some of his best work).  Joe displays plenty of emotion through his guitar on the ballad &quot;Always with Me, Always with You.&quot;  &quot;Midnight&quot; shows off some awesome finger picking and &quot;Mystical Potato Head Groove Thing&quot; is just as trippy as the title suggests.<br /><br />You recognize Steve Vai's signature guitar tone when he takes the stage with &quot;You're Here.&quot;  He doesn't do it often, but Steve sings on this one.  Vai resurrects a rare track from that Keanu Reeves classic `Bill &amp; Ted's Bogus Journey' for his second song &quot;Reaping.&quot;  Formerly known as &quot;The Reaper,&quot; this is one of Steve's heavier songs, and in my opinion, one of his best.  Steve's fans will be pleased with the extra long, guitar-wailing conclusion.  The final song for Vai is one of his trademark ballads, the nine-minute tearjerker &quot;Whispering a Prayer&quot; (Steve, shouldn't this have been track seven?).  Yngwie's set focuses on his current fascination with classical music.  Its evident Yngwie hasn't lost any of his speed on &quot;Blitzkrieg.&quot;  The classical tracks (whose titles are too long to type) display more of his guitar mechanics.  Yngwie kicks ass on the Hendrix classic &quot;Red House.&quot;<br /><br />On disc two the guitar masters come together for the G3 Jam session. It's more or less a forum for the guys to try and out play each other.  The results are astounding as the listener is treated to some excellent shredding.  I guess Hendrix was a big influence on these three because they jam on &quot;Voodoo Child&quot; and &quot;Little Wing.&quot;  It's tough sometimes to hear which one is Vai and which one is Satriani, but there's no mistaking Yngwie.  Each player tries to top the other with Malmsteen standing out.  The disc concludes with a fiery version of Neil Young's &quot;Rockin' in the Free World.&quot;  I wonder if they realize that this is a sad song.<br /><br />Anything bad?<br />Yngwie has always been great when he shreds on rockin' tunes, but when it comes to his classical stuff...yawn!  Is it me or does Yngwie play the same solo in different keys lately?<br /><br />Bottom Line<br />I must say, I never thought these guys would share the same stage.  This is just a sampling of what these three virtuosos are capable of.  All are great guitarist with their own unique sound.  Two CDs cannot contain their live energy and musicianship.nt shredding.

B00005JMFQ|4.0|Ok, so I admit it. I thought this was one big romance movie, really I did. Then it hit me, love is not just what you feel as when you want to have a relationship with someone. It's what you feel towards your mother/father/sister/brother. It is what I feel for my kids, or that special feel I get everytime I'm in love with someone. It was great to see this in a film all the different sides to the feeling of &quot;love&quot;...Although I wasn't sure exactly what happened with Alan Rickman's (love that voice!) and Emma Thompson's characters, I think it means I will have to see it again. In all, it makes you feel great once you see it. Like you are floating on air.
B000002UZU|5.0|When I first heard it, \\"Hooker and Heat\\" blew me away.  It still does.<br />It doesn't get any better than this.  Separately, Canned Heat and John Lee Hooker both produced excellent blues material, but together, they seemed to work off each other.  It seems like the intensity of each got kicked up a level when they went into the studio to record this collection.<br />The recordings are stripped down, raw.  My favorites are \\"Alimonia Blues\\", \\"You Talk Too Much\\" and \\"Peavine\\", but the rest of the set is great too.  I guess if you're a blues purist or a member of some obscure mutual admiration society, the studio chatter is probably going to be offensive.<br />My personal opinion is that all of the extra stuff adds authenticy to the recordings.  That's part of what makes this collection unique.  After all, if I wanted to listen to some of the material on this collection without the chatter, I could do so by listening to one of dozens of other Canned Heat or Hooker recordings.
B000003TA4|5.0|this is essiantly a perfect rock album. nirvana is one of the most influential bands in history. and kurt cobain was a musical genius, its tragic that he had to do what he did. this album is great, everysong a classic. if u dont have it by now, hurry up and get it!!
B00005JMEW|1.0|As a hard-line, right-wing, ultra-conservative, gun-toting klansman, I expected that I would find this film to my liking. However, upon viewing this film, my thoughts regarding the perverse liberal mores of today were merely confirmed. It becomes evident, quite clearly, that Quentin Tarantino is a Democrat, something which I find quite unacceptable. I was highly disgusted by the utter lack of violence in this film, but was somewhat pleased by it. His political stances are evident, if not elucidated to a great extent, in this film. Take for example the particular scene in which the woman decides to attack the other woman; only a tree-hugging liberal would contrive such a lascivious scene. In summation, however, I would recommend this film, as it is highly entertaining and a delight for the entire family. By the way, I haven't taken a shower today.
B0001AP12G|5.0|The whole CD bangs and the skits are funny as hell.
0780622553|5.0|When I first saw this, I was confused partly by the main character's responses to his awareness of his life being a fraud. Because in the movie, he discovers that all his life is a series of memories that are not real, and the physical world itself is not even real, being capable of change just through sheer willpower and mind. Thinking back, however, I see what they were trying to do (the movie-makers). The big problem with this movie was that the technology of film was not good enough to communicate what was being said. The film was supposed to make you question the screen you were looking at (the computer, TV, or movie screen) and use that as a basis for meditation on what was real or not.<br />Also, the main character's internal emotional experience could not be justified on the basis of him and one other character alone. In the movie he is the good guy, and another guy played by Kiefer Sutherland is the bad guy. These are supposed to be motifs of the good guy, but it turns out looking like they were both equal in strength and stature. This severly dampens our understanding of Proyas's intense and ugly view of reality--how little we question it.
B000055Y0X|5.0|Only mastery of ironic humor can make the world being destroyed by nuclear weapons one of the most funny and provocative movie experiences of my life.  It's all the more amazing when I consider the fact that the U.S. was in the thick of the Cold War when this film was released.<br />How could it not be silly to see these immature men who lead a big world playing with their very big toys?  The lives of millions are at stake but they're just not capable of really taking it seriously.  It takes so long for the concept to dawn on them that even their narrow and selfish interests are impinged upon by nuclear disaster and all the while, Dr. Strangelove watches from the shadows where his presence is evidenced by little more than the gleaming of his spectacles.  He comes out when the time is right to regale us with his nerdy German accent and to usher in a new era.<br />The 'manly men' of the movie normally touted as heroes are portrayed as stupid and sexually deranged.  In fact, the whole mess starts with a general who has gone impotent and comes to what is in his mind, a logical conclusion as to why it happened.  So in the end, those long missiles and giant bombs turn out to be phallic symbols compensating for an aging man's personal insecurities!<br />The humor in this film can be subtle at times and the dialogue is just wonderful.  The viewer has to pay close attention to catch it all and the rewards are great indeed.  It certainly makes the viewer think about how small humanity really is and how petty and egotistical we can be.  Dr. Strangelove works on multiple levels    and it is eminently worthwhile to see it and see it again.
B00003CXCT|1.0|I have now lost all respect for Georgy boy. IV, V and VI were great on they're own, why mess with that? As my father allways said, if it aint broke don't fix it.(watching the \\"enhanced\\" versions, i wanted to break somethin, thats for sure).<BR>looks as though the \\"special\\" olympic effects were done in a weekend. <BR>There can be only one reason for the way in which Lucas has handled this, the ALMIGHTY DOLLAR, and for that he has bastardised one the greatest trilogies of all time. <BR>I refused to buy the revamped versions on VHS, waiting and waiting,  saying \\"I'll wait till the originals came out on DVD - and now I get THIS?

B000059ZT4|5.0|A startling debut effort from the Wailers! This mighty record introduced Bob Marley, Peter Tosh, Bunny Livingston and the Barrett brothers to the world in 1973. The reggae revolution in Jamaica was making quite an impact in the UK when Island Records took an interest in the Wailers. They took the original Jamaican recording and added some additional instrumentation (with the Wailers approval of course) before releasing this album in the UK and America. This wonderful CD has both versions in their entirety! It's impossible to decide which version is better (though the Jamaican version has extra tracks) so it's really worth having both versions. The music itself is absolutely wonderful and timeless. Marley is both a spiritual and political hero for many people and this record reflects many of his political concerns (&quot;Concrete Jungle&quot;) but also features tender and beautiful love songs (&quot;Stir It Up&quot;) as well. Peter Tosh's remarkable contribution (&quot;400 Years&quot;) proves there was more to the Wailers than just Bob Marley. Though not as critically acclaimed as later Bob Marley releases like &quot;Exodus&quot; this is still one of my absolute favorite records and I highly recommend it as a starting point for the novice reggae fan. This wonderful package also has the original artwork, which was later changed once Marley had achieved worldwide success and popularity. Simply astounding!
B0001Z52RU|5.0|I have never seen Ashton Kutcher in any of his films or on his television show, so I had no opinion of his acting skills, which are great.  The pacing of the show kept me spellbound and this was the only movie I talked about for an entire weekend.  From opening night I have waited for the DVD, just so I can revisit it and catch all the clues I missed.  Don't miss it.
B00006AW2G|5.0|Let It Bleed reflected everything that was dark and wrong about the 60's. Despite Mellow Yellow vibes of peace and love, the 60's were pretty unpleasant. Viet Nam, Martin Luther King's murder, Helter Skelter, Altamont...the list goes on and on. This album perfectly encapsulates the entire decade in one package with sounds both dark and beautiful. In my opinion, &quot;Gimme Shelter&quot; is the perfect song to sum up the entire decade. It reverberates with menace as Richards lays down some of the most sinister guitar riffs ever while Jagger sings haunted lyrics of discontent and horror. Yet at the end, the optimism that seemed to promise a brighter future is there as well (&quot;love sister...is just a kiss away.&quot;). If not the greatest rock and roll song of all time, then one of the top contenders. If the rest of the album were terrible it would still be worthwhile for &quot;Gimmer Shelter&quot; alone. Fortunately, the album is a masterpiece, arguably the Stones absolute best. You get the desperate beauty of Robert Johnson's &quot;Love in Vain&quot;, the psychotic vibe of &quot;Midnight Rambler&quot;, the perfectly sinister &quot;Monkey Man&quot; and the grandiose majesty of &quot;You Can't Always Get What You Want&quot;. &quot;You Got The Silver&quot; features Brian Jones on autoharp, possibly his last contribution to the Stones greatness. &quot;Country Honk&quot; is the Gram Parsons/Hank Williams influenced version of &quot;Honky Tonk Women&quot; (but it's also how Richards originally envisioned it) which features the gorgeous slide guitar playing of Mick Taylor. Honestly, there isn't a single bad track on this album. If you were only going to own one Stones record, I would bypass every Greatest Hits collection and go straight for this one. I cannot recommend this album enough, it's importance can never be overstated!
B000000JO3|5.0|This album is 1 of 3 any person who says they are a fan of punk should own. The other 2 are Black Flag's &quot;Damaged&quot; and the Misfits' &quot;Walk Among Us&quot;.  If you don't own these albums you should seriously pick them up as well as any other by those bands.
B00004YZFR|5.0|All the muddy good vibes of Woodstock were negated after Altamont. The 60's, one of the most tumultuous and violent decades of the last century, were officially over. These hapless filmmakers were supposed to film the Stones on tour in America, what they got was the decade's dying last breath. This documentary is like having a front row seat as Manson orchestrated the Helter Sklter murders, it's quite shocking. In terms of a concert film, it's probably a little disappointing. Considering the Hell's Angels keep beating people up (including a member of the Jefferson Airplane) it's not surprising that the Stones sound so horrible. From a voyeuristic point of view, this film is unprecedented. The murder on screen happens so fast they probably weren't even aware of what they were seeing as it happened. They have to slow down and freeze frame the shot to even see it happen. Lurid and horrifying. As far as DVD's go, this is a Criterion DVD so you know it's KILLER. You get tons of bonus stuff, commentary from the filmmakers, a studio mix session and more. As a Stones document, it is priceless. The behind the scenes footage (and Madison Square Garden footage) is remarkable. And I love the Stones in Muscle Shoals working on what would become the 1971 masterpiece LP Sticky Fingers. Watching Keith listening to the Wild Horses playback is a rare privilege.

0201633612|5.0|I picked up this book at the recommendation of another book (Guru's Guide to Sql Server Stored Procedures) and was surprised at how well what it teaches applies to the languages I use most of the time, VB.NET and Transact-Sql. The other book had a chapter on design patterns in Transact-Sql and showed how some of the ones in this book as well as a few new ones were common in Transact-Sql stored procedures.  <br />Thanks to that book and this one, I now look at code differently and know a pattern when I see it. Even for non-OOP languages, this book is a godsend for those who care about design. <br />The book is also extremely well written and as clear as it possibly can be.  I read through it the first time over a weekend and came away charged up and ready to pattern the world!<br />I can't apply everything it teaches to my daily work, but enough of it applies that I highly recommend this book regardless of the language your using.
B00003CXCT|2.0|Logically Both Additions Should Be Released<br />What’s the loss in releasing both additions I ask? I personally would prefer the originals along with the 58,000 odd people who have joined in the petition at the Originaltrilogy website. Any sane businessperson would see 50 thousand anxious customers willing to purchase a $70 trilogy DVD set a worthy investment. As it seems though using simple logic (whether that concerns Business, Casting, Scripting, or Acting) has long since deserted the Star Wars franchise. Sadly the greatness of the original stories of Long Ago, in a Galaxy Far Far Away will forever remain a memory to the imaginative few (58,437 and counting)…<br />~`Andrew: Star Wars fan since age 6’~

B000002H97|5.0|Well theres not much to say xcept. This is Metallica at their prime. They took their thoughts, feelings and emotions, and made one hell of a great f**king cd!! Guitar work is excellent as always, and drums are precise, bass is louder than on all of their last cd's, and Jason Newsted's membership to the band was the best thing scince Cliff! This cd gives credit to all member's instead of just the guitar and drums.
B00005ATQI|5.0|This is a good classic film that will really scare you.
B00004Y6O9|5.0|One of the greatest debuts of all time (along with Led Zeppelin 1 and Are You Experienced?), and an outstanding rock album created solely for the purpose of showcasing the unabashed showmanship every member of the band possessed. The band kicks it off into high gear immediately with &quot;Runnin' With The Devil&quot;, a song about living a reckless life on the road. The following tracks are no less exciting,and every track it seems became a hit single, or atleast had the potential to be. Eddie Van Halens mind blowing guitar work combined with David Lee Roths arena rock voice ensure that the needle is blown off the scale with tracks such as &quot;Aint Talkin'Bout Love,&quot; &quot;Im The One&quot; and &quot;On Fire,&quot; while also producing little hard rock classics like &quot;Little Dreamer&quot; and &quot;Jamie's Cryin&quot;. As far as commercial, fun loving, over the top heavy metal/rock n roll, this is good as it gets, and set the path for Bon Jovi and Aerosmiths comeback albums. An incredibly influential album, and essential for any rock collection.

B0000DD7LB|5.0|This is the best Cd i have ever purchased. Britney is very creative and talented. This cd is packed with a lot of different genres of music ranging from pop to r&amp;b to hip hop to dance. Britney is gonna be around for a very long time, long enough to be the next MADONNA!
B000021YQV|5.0|First, I must say that I don't buy many recent releases because most contemporary music out there just doesn't interest me. This, however, caught my attention. Like most people, I was brought in by &quot;Chop Suey&quot; (who would give a song THAT title?, I thought). After listening to the entire album, I came to the conclusion that this is simply stunning. Nobody else that I know of has created anything like this. I love the quirky attack, the hard-as-nails rhythms, the unique vocals, and the thoughtful and inspiring lyrics. I don't understand the reviews that deem this &quot;terrorist&quot; music; I see it as the exact opposite: the epitome of peace-loving music. I don't consider it &quot;nu metal,&quot; either, because it's nothing like what comes under that category these days. This is a product of original thought, nothing less, and, as such, is bound to have its detractors. I love it. (And FYI, I think &quot;Prison Song&quot; is one of the scariest and most effective songs I've ever heard.)
B0001W8Q9Y|1.0|Marillion never has been a band whose music one bought for the pop tunes. Lets review the past: the closest they have been to \\"pop\\" have been songs like Kayleigh (one of 80's best), Incommunicado and perhaps Noone can take you away....<BR>If you look at some of the \\"Favorites\\" lists of music critics, you will definitely find Brave in the list. Noone can debate the epic that that album marked. Ok, it may not have been a massive commercial success and not been in the TOP 40 (something the gentlemen seem to love more than their music), it was a musical masterpiece. The lyrics, were of a phenominal quality; they were beyond ones ever written by \\"H\\" as we/they/he fondly call him. Yes, the album was dark.... just what you bargained for. Afraid of.. was a continuation thereof, albeit not in a theatrical fashion. Even the \\"pop-py\\" Beautiful, was a good listen but the epics remained the afraid of sunrise, king etc. (lyrics like spirit rack abuses/ byzantine excuses/ memories prick your thumbs/ hide you in the folds of my heart\\"... absolute genious)<BR>I don't know what got into them but Radiation was horrific and improvement followed and I agree with other reviewers that Interior Lulu is a masterpiece.<br />Not unlike other aspects of life, everything seems to evolve around money. It was very clear from the very beginning that the new album was going to be commercially driven and the slogan \\".... blow it out of the water...\\" implied such a plan. Clearly, the once-fab five had money on their mind. Being as honest as they usually are, it would have been a courtesy to the fans to inform them that this album was going to be more in lines with the billboard 100 productions. The lyrics (may I call your attention to phrases like \\"the sea is my wife\\", \\"you have the day, I have the night\\", \\"I let the genie out of the box\\") remind me of schoolboys desparately attempting lyrical recognition. Songs like \\"the only unforgiveable thing\\" and \\"Don't hurt yourself\\" are easily found on cd's you can buy in the 5 cd's for $1 rack. The tunes are deplorable and the melodies are made out of changing octaves in gut wretching sequences. The joke of the CD has to be the opening track: clearly a few different tracks that were glued together without any coherence in order to create the symphonic rock atmosphere... it is truly an insult.<br />Finally, it is clear to me that the lyrical genius Brave is due to John Helmers hand.. something that Mr Hogarth has totally lost on this teeny bopper album. Even his voice has deteriorated (listen to his shouting at the end of the first track). Readers, witness the death of a great Goliath, Marillion. I am sorry; very sorry I had to write this but this is what a true fan since 1982 feels.<br />Signing off (Marillion)<br />PS: what are they thinking with the fragmented lullaby Marbles I-IV?? The one star only refers to \\"Fantastic Place\\" and \\"Neverland\\".<br />PS2: I wish the online campaign allowed return for a full refund...
B0000DD7LB|5.0|This is one of the best pop albums of the past few years.  If you want a large variety of great pop songs, this is the album for you!  Ignore the pathetic haters that post the same review over and over, saying it's crap.  Listen to me when I say this is a GREAT album!  I guarantee you won't be dissapointed if you give it a chance!
B000000OSE|5.0|this record, along with use your illusion II, is beyond amazing. when it comes to the 2 illusion albums i say screw appetite. my favorite song on it is &quot;november rain.&quot; other highlights include &quot;right next door to hell,&quot; &quot;live and let die,&quot; &quot;dont cry,&quot; &quot;double talkin' jive,&quot; and the amazing &quot;coma.&quot; i think some will disagree with me though when i say that i think it is a brilliant idea that these are sold separatly. so if you are interested in it and you're not sure about it, who cares. BUY IT!
B0001L3MI0|4.0|Simply put, it is an entertaining movie to watch for its special effects, its comic relief and enjoyable storyline fantasy.
B000000H4V|5.0|Sepultura is my favorite metal group period. Chaos A.D. is as solid of a release as I have ever heard. This album is much slower, and more brutal than earlier releases. This is where they went into more of a Grindcore/Death Metal sound. They still show their Thrash and Punk influences on the entire album, but add so much more to thier music. Some fans didn't like the change of pace or style and I can only assume that the new Sepultura sound must be to brutal for them! I'm one of the true Sepultura fans who have enjoyed all the albums Sepultura has created. I got their albums when they were first released and I can still listen to them over and over again. Chaos A.D. and Roots are amazing masterpieces that will pump you up and make you pissed off at the world. Refuse/Resist !!!!
B00008G9JO|5.0|&quot;Heavy Horses&quot; and its predecessor &quot;Songs From the Wood&quot; are two Jethro Tull albums heavily inspired by English country life, and musically greatly influenced by British folk and traditional music. In my opinion &quot;Heavy Horses&quot; is by far the most successful of the two. First of all because the songs generally are better; but also because there seems to be a more relaxed feel to the songs and the playing. Anderson`s brilliant acoustic guitar is prominent on most tracks and the album is one of the most melodic Tull albums.<br />Apart from &quot;No Lullaby&quot; , for which I`ve never learned to care, there are no weak tracks on this terrific album. Songs like &quot;Acres Wild&quot;, &quot;Moths&quot;, &quot;Rover&quot; are among my all time favourites. The title track is also great, but the outstanding song, though, is the beautiful &quot;One Brown Mouse&quot;.<br />Even the two bonus-tracks are great, especially &quot;Living in these Hard Times&quot;. Conclusion: This album is a must buy, not only for any Jethro Tull fan, but for any fan of music in general.
B0000DD7LB|5.0|First of all, those people at the bottom critizing Britney and saying all bad things about her are just dumb and stupid people, who probably don't have a job and all they do is just critized the best celebrities. OK, now that I said that, I believe that this album is the one of the best, like all the other albums Britney has made. It has a very good toone, all the tracks are just perfect. They really show how Britney has grown since the last 5 years.  All tracks are my favorite, specially TOXIC, which was #1 for many weeks, didn't want to leave that spot :). So all those people who all they do is say crap about Britney are crazy and should get a better job. Is not like Britney is gonna listen to them. Down with you, all you Britney haters. ************************************************************************************************************************************************************************************************
B0000DD7LB|5.0|Amazing album, period.  It's the best one I've listened to in a while.  Nothing recent by Janet or Madonna can compete with this.  Every song will evoke a different emotion in you, and there's plenty of great songs to dance or groove.  There's also plenty of melodic, soothing songs.  The best tracks, in my opinion, are: Breathe on me, Toxic, (I Got That) Boom Boom, Touch of my Hand, The Hook Up, Outrageous, Everytime, &amp; Me Against the Music.  As you can see, that's just about all the songs on the album!  You can truly listen to &quot;In the Zone&quot; all the way through and it's also great for repeated listens.  If you're a fan of pop music, or music in general, there's definitely a lot of things to like on this album.  Pick it up, ASAP!!!
B000025XKM|4.0|\\"You know, Nick Drake was the very best of all.\\"  This quote, from Television's Tom Verlaine, is a bit flawed in my opinion.  Nick Drake was just 26 when he passed away due to an overdose of antidepressants - some say it was suicide but most disagree with this assumption.  Anyway, I believe Drake COULD have been the very best (so much lost potential it is a shame) because this album kept up the high standards of his first two albums Five Leaves Left and Bryter Layter, while adding more of the sinister edge that makes this album's title track so enticing.  The story goes that Drake entered such a deep depression that he never spoke to anyone, and these recordings were all anyone heard of his voice.  After completing the album alone using just his acoustic guitar, gorgeous English voice, and a few splashes of piano, he dropped it off at the desk of his record label anonymously, and when it was finally opened and played they realized they had a fantastic new album from the inimitable Nick Drake.  This alone makes the music very interesting before you even get the album in your stereo, but once the opening strums of the title track chime in, you know it will live up to the expectations you have.  Full of gorgeous acoustic playing from start to finish, and great lyrics to boot, this is an essential folk recording.  There are 3 reasons I gave this CD 4 stars instead of 5 - first, where are the liner notes?  This is a fabulous sounding reissue, and there's lyrics, but I would have loved to have seen some commentary.  Second, the album runs about 28 minutes - the re-issuers could have easily combined it with Bryter Layter or included bonus tracks from the Time of No Reply rarities collection, without screwing up the trak order or overall feel of the album.  Finally, although I love this album, I find the middle of it runs a bit slow - \\"Horn\\" is a pointless instrumental that doesn't show what Drake can do as a composer or an acoustic player, and \\"Free Ride\\" and \\"Parasite\\" lack hooks that make the first half of the album so enticing.  Nevertheless, I would still consider Pink Moon an essential purchase and a jewel in my huge CD collection.<br />Best Tracks:<BR>\\"Pink Moon\\" - Used in a VW commercial, this was an odd song to sell cars but it introduced the world to one of Drake's best tunes.  Sinister lyrics, subtle acoustic strumming, and perfect use of soft piano make this an economical and heartbreaking song.<BR>\\"Place To Be\\" - I've always loved Alex Chilton's acoustic folkier material, and this reminds me a bit of him.  Keeps the album flowing smoothly, great tune.<BR>\\"Road\\" - More affecting folk with superb guitar playing.  Another all time Drake fave.<BR>\\"Which Will\\" - Probably my favorite guitar playing and lyric on the record.  Drake sings his heart out on this one and reminds me why I love his voice so much.<BR>\\"From The Morning\\" - A great album closer.  The guitar style on this tune features a bit more fingerpicking, and this is a great song to close with after the mid-album drag.
B00009V7T2|1.0|I've listned to this album and theres absolutely nothing special about it whatever. At times the album gets a little more progreessive in the occasional song but besides thoses rare moments this cd is horrible! I highly recommend you do not buy this cd. I've heard this cd called progressive metal and hard rock. What what are you people smoking this is like space  emo crap!!!!! 0 STARS
B000069HZP|4.0|This is a fascinating movie; of course, it's necessary to accept the extremely unreal premise of a wealthy and privileged multi-millionaire going along with a \\"game?that takes everything away form him, but once that is accepted, it's very entertaining.<br />In fact, I would say that the movie follows the \\"hero's journey?of mythology. An individual has his life completely transformed as he is stripped of everything and forced to confront a world where nothing is certain and everything is turned upside down. Nicholas Van Orton is a successful investment banker whose life is perfectly ordered. Then his brother gives him a \\"gift??a game that will throw him into a nightmare world. Small things become symbolic: at one point, the impeccably dressed executive loses his thousand dollar shoes, which are pulled from his feet. The man who wears $3,000 suits and $200 ties is now barefoot. He is symbolically stripped of his staus and freedom as well: In the ancient world, only slaves went barefoot, as a symbol of their status. The banker, once arrogant and well-dressed, is now the barefoot slave of the Game. <br />I was suspicious of the theme of theme of the humiliation of the \\"cold-hearted white male businessman? which is endlessly repeated in films, but this movie was different, and I did enjoy it.

B00005JMJ4|5.0|&quot;Lost in Translation&quot; is an exquisite blend of cinematic beauty and introspective genius played out amid the chaotic cynicism of modern times.<BR>Upon reading the reviews of those who rated this film poorly, I can only comment that these words say far more about the viewers than about the film.  While no film can appeal to all (NOR SHOULD ONE!), to dismiss a film like this as \\"bad\\" simply because one cannot understand its depth and grasp its subtleties, reveals only the obtuse nature of contemporary American society.

B00006LSM3|5.0|I bought this album a month after its release. Im a huge George Harrisons fan; and I can tell you that every song on this album is a masterpiece! &quot;Any road&quot; is excellent, as well as &quot;Pisces fish&quot;, &quot;Looking for my life&quot;, &quot;Rising sun&quot;, &quot;Stuck inside a cloud&quot;, &quot;Run so far&quot;, the classic &quot;Between the devil and the deep blue sea&quot; and &quot;Brainwashed&quot;. &quot;Rocking chair in Hawaii&quot; is perhaps the worst song, but even so, a very good one. <BR>If you want to buy other albums, try &quot;Gonne troppo&quot; (nevermind critics! Just excellent!), &quot;Cloud 9&quot;, &quot;All things must pass&quot;, &quot;George Harrison&quot;, &quot;Somewhere in England&quot; and &quot;33 and 1/3&quot; and listen to REAL MUSIC! thanks for reading!
B000002PCS|5.0|The score for Somewhere in Time is truely amazing.  I think it is one of the best scores ever written.  It stays with you long after you have seen the film.  The music is perfect throughout the movie.  Each scene has exactly the right musical background.  The most moving, for me, is the short piece of music that is heard in the scene where an aged McKenna is returning to her hotel room having met Collier.  I find it some of the most moving music I have ever heard in a film.  For me, I can listen to the score and visualize the scene in my mind, remembering dialog and even remembering clothes that were worn at the time.  I think it is partly due to the score that this film has remained so popular over the years since it was released.  The score made the movie memorable.  It should be in everyone's film soundtrack library.
B00001ODGR|5.0|Like the rest of the guys that saw this dvd, I think this is the dvd all the bands (and all the fans) want to have, excellent video, excellent sound, excellent perfomance.

B00008DDXC|3.0|It appears that these Harry Potter movies appeal to all ages.  I know two adult males who go to all of them.  As do my young children.  However, with so much suspense and complicated plots, they are better suited to pre-teen and young adults.<br />Being one of the very few adults who have not read a single Harry Potter book, I was certainly not prepared for such an onslaught of scary situations and monsters as this movie put forth. I usually can take a lot of mysterious scarriness without being bothered, but some of this was so gross I wondered how on earth the people watching the movie as I did could sit there and put their little children through that horror. And whether these children would have nightmares for weeks (perhaps months) to come.<br />Parts of this movie was enjoyable and entertaining. But I would never take my seven-yr. old grandson to see such violence.<BR>The flying car was fun to watch, shades of Chitty Bang Bang and Stars Wars special effects crammed together.

B000063COX|5.0|The Maiden formed in 1976, and for 4 years they toured the underground English club circuit before signing on to a majro label and releasing their fantastic self-titled Debut album, IRON MAIDEN. Along with Never-Say-Die members Steve Harris and Dave Murray, who have stayed with the group during it's entire life-span, this album features the sole appearance of guitarris Dennis Straton and drummer Doug Samson, plus original vocalist Paul Di'Anno. Right from the start, Iron Maiden were more than just a promising band, they delivered the goods on every one of the album's 9 tracks.As a debut it's one of the best in all of metal, and as a Maiden album it's among their best work. <br />Opener &quot;Prowler&quot; sports one of the most awesome guitar riffs of their career, a police car siren attack that sets high standards for the rest of the album. &quot;Sanctuary&quot; is a famous maiden track with good bass and a catchy chorus, not my fave, but still pretty good. &quot;Remember Tomorrow&quot; alternates between calm acoustic passages and loud instrumental heaviness, an awesome track. Following is the fun and anthemic hit single &quot;Running Free&quot;, plus the sprawling 7-min masterpiece of &quot;Phantom of the Opera&quot;. &quot;Transylvania&quot; is a fast and hard-hitting instrumental that transforms into the beautiful atmospheric &quot;Strange World&quot;. &quot;Charlotte the Harlot&quot; is the first of a 4-part series, and is one of the best of the lot. Their namesake closer is one of the most memorable Maiden songs; there's just something breathtaking about the first guitar riff, which would provide the blueprint for many other great Maiden riffs to come. <br />All in All, Iron Maiden leaves nothing to be desired save for more Maiden. While most think Maiden hit their Stride with Dickinson &amp; Number of the Beast, Paul Di'Anno and both of his Maiden albums are nearly as exceptional as that &quot;Beast&quot; of an album.<br />Prowler- 10/10<BR>Sanctuary- 8/10<BR>Remember Tomorrow- 9/10<BR>Running Free- 9.5/10<BR>Phantom of the Opera- 9.5/10<BR>Transylvania- 9/10<BR>Strange World- 9/10<BR>Charlotte the Harlot- 8.5/10<BR>Iron Maiden- 10/10
0385510438|1.0|I am a big fan of John Grisham, but this book has to be his worst.  While the characters were enjoyable, I'm not quite sure there was a point to the book at all.  There was no suspense, or mystery, or anything worth grasping.  It went along at a snails pace and I think this could have been written in 100 pages instead of 355 pages.  Don't waste your time or money.
B00000I07R|5.0|Slippery When Wet made them superstars. New Jersey established them as a great rock band, but Keep The Faith just proves that Bon Jovi is not just another band from the 80's. There are the trademark Bon Jovi songs with the catchy chorus and guitar riffs, but it's the songs that are different to Bon Jovi fans that makes this album work. The opening track I Believe is a solid rock that grabs your attention and it is followed by the title track which is a departure from anything on the New Jersey album. I'll Sleep When I'm Dead is a typical Bon Jovi sing-a-along that's fun to listen to and In These Arms is a cool rock ballad for the ladies, but it was Bed Of Roses that got all of the women to cry. It was also the biggest hit off of the album. The best track would have to be Dry County. Jon Bon Jovi is at his best vocally and Richie Sambora pulls off an excellent guitar riff that will blow your socks offf. The most underrated song would have to be Fear. This song definitely stands out on this album compared to the other songs. To give you my honest opinion, this is Bon Jovi's best album and I am a huge Bon Jovi fan. The songs are more solid and put together than any other Bon Jovi tune. This album also proves than Bon Jovi can be taken seriously as artists and not just another 80's rock band lying by the waste side.
6305665753|2.0|The plot is crazy the kid is annoying but you can kind of cheer for the hero...and at least we don't see any shots of Stallone in a diaper.  We have to wait for Stop! Or my mom will shoot (the great epic of 1992) for that.
B00005R2M3|4.0|I like this CD a lot. The songs are catchy and great to sing along with, and are quite diverse-some are fast and some are slow, so you'll be guaranteed to like at least one song. Shakira has a fairly nice voice, although sometimes how accent gets in the way. Most of the time I didn't made the accent, eve liked it a bit, but if I didn't know she was Latino I'd have assumed she was mumbling. My favorite tracks were the songs in Spanish, I didn't know what they meant but all songs in a foreign language sound exotic and her accent doesn't get in the way.
076790592X|4.0|Everyone should have a Morrie Schwartz in his/her life. Such an incredible man with such wisdom. Thank you Mitch for writing this memoir. You were lucky to have known him.
B00006V9A0|5.0|I bought this album just for one song and that was &quot;You know ur right&quot;. I was dieing to hear that song before i bought the album, and thats why i gave it a 5 star rating. But here's the problem. Only an hardcore and i mean hardcore fan would buy this album because of Kurt's last song. But other than that the album doesnt have much to offer. New fans might get something out of it. But i would recommened to buy the album &quot;Nevermind&quot; or &quot;In utero&quot; first.
B00003TL18|5.0|His songs sends me into dreams. I love his whole group, they are so up-to-date and the whole DVD is just the greatest!
B000089RVX|5.0|While most of the album is quite dark and is described by many as goth, and normally I like dance songs, I still loved this album. Why?<br />1)Amy Lee (the lead singer) has an amazing voice.<br />2)The lyrics are moving. I myself have had a happy life and usually don't relate to depressing lyrics, but I still liked the ones in here. They are open to interpretation (such as \\"Tourniquet\\" which is considered by some to be a Christian song, though I dissagree) and range from slow, melancholy songs like \\"My Immortal\\" or \\"Hello\\" to fast, harsh songs like \\"Haunted\\" or \\"Going Under\\" so you will relate to at least ne of these songs. <br />3)The instrumentals are pretty good. They're not amazing, but I didn't really pay attention because I was listening to Amy's voice.<br />Don't pay attention to people who tell you that Evanescence isn't really goth. That's because they aren't supposed to be goth. Depressing doesn't equal goth, and I don't believe you should buy a CD because it's a certain genre (and just because they don't do the genre like you think it's supposed to be done doesn't mean they're posers, that means they're adding in some stuff of their own) you should buy a CD because it has great music on it, even if that music isn't usually your style. <br />For parents wondering if this is suitable for children, there is no swearing and only one sex referance (In 'Haunted':\\"I can feel you pull me down/saving me/raping me/watching me\\") how ever the lyrics are dark and depressing (in fact, I was scared by the violent \\"Tourniquet\\" at first) but I got this CD when I was around 10 or 11 and eventually got over the lyrics, and the slower songs are simply sad (especially the poignant \\"Hello\\") so I'd suggest PG or PG-13 depending on how mature your child is.
B00004TL21|5.0|I'd have to say this is my favorite Deftones album. Lots of screaming and awesome riffs as usual.<br />1 -- Back to School 9.5/10 Not much screaming here, its the best song to start off the album with.<br />2 -- Feiticeira 8/10 Never really listened to this song much. It's an ok song but definitely nowhere close to the best song on the album.<br />3 -- Digital Bath 10/10 Slower deftones song, no screaming. One of my favorite songs on the album. Starts off slow but gradually gets better.<br />4 -- Elite 9.5/10 Awesome song, another one of my favorites. Its literally ALL scream!!! took me a while to actually listen to the whole thing but it gets a lot better the more you get into it.<br />5 -- Rx Queen  /10<br />6 -- Street Carp 5/10 although it is kind of a cool song it gets very annoying very quickly. I can't stand it anymore.<br />7 -- teenager 8/10 slow song with nice drum beats and vinyl dust static in the beginning, Everything fits perfectly into this song, no screamo.<br />8 -- Knife Prty 10/10 Very awesome song, starts slow like most but gets up beat by 19 seconds of time. GO GET YOUR KNIFE GO GET YOUR KNIFE!!!<br />9 -- Korea 10/10 Just an all around good song.<br />10 -- 8/10 cool song, Chino sounds a lot like Tool in this song.<br />11 -- Change (In the House of Flies) 10/10 another slow song but one of my very favorites<br />12 -- Pink Maggit 7/10 not very original starts off very very slow with a ton of high pitched voice until about 2:43 then it all turns into Back to School.<br />Over all awesome CD still gets 5 stars even when some songs get low ratings.
B000003TA4|5.0|Its a no braniner that this is by far the most best nirvana album ever. If there's anybody who wants to get into Nirvana, should BUY this album. All of the songs are terrific and flawless! The amazing lyrics makes this album an absolute must buy! <BR>(...)
0780624890|5.0|Firstly this movie is one of the best films to come out of the 90's, one of the movie kung-fu type heroes with swords,guns the whole nine yards.Plus the first movie the feature the Bullet-time effect ,not The Matrix!!Plus there was that building jump, anybody remember that? . And also one of the quotes from Blade<br />&quot;You better wake up, the world you live in is just a sugar coated topping, there is another world beneath it , the real world and if you want to survive it you better learn to pull the trigger&quot;.
B000002KE2|5.0|Since their first album, Black Sabbath has been consistantly getting better until 1976's Technical Ecstasy. Their highpoint was their fourth album, the aptly named Volume 4.<br />1)Wheels of Confusion(10/10)<BR>Has kind of a blusey begining but than really smashes into a heavy riff. After Ozzy says &quot;Was it Illusion?&quot;, it has one of the best guitar parts ever.<BR>2)Tomorrows Dream (8/10)<BR>For some reason, I always skip this song but I don't know why because this is a really good song.<BR>3)Changes (8/10)<BR>A very melodic song that isn't popular enough.<BR>4)FX (5/10)<BR>Just a weird song. Can you say acid trip?<BR>5)Supernaut (20/10)<BR>The absolute best song by any band ever. The best riff and drums.<BR>6)Snowblind (10/10)<BR>A song about cocaine that gets played at tours too much.<BR>7)Cornucopia (9/10)<BR>One of their heaviest songs. Very catchy!<BR>8)Laguna Sunrise (9/10)<BR>A very good instrumental that has two acoustic guitars<BR>9)St. Vitus' Dance (9/10)<BR>Doesn't sound like Sabbath at all but once you get used to it, you'll like it.<BR>10)Under The Sun (10/10)<BR>Another heavy one that has many different stages like Wheels Of Confusion
B000003TAR|5.0|Wow!..... thats what i said when i got the album. I never thought that &quot;in Utero&quot; is gonna do as good as the album &quot;Nevermind&quot;. This is ofcourse Kurt's last major album. What a great way to remember Kurt from this CD. Buy it! this album is too good for words!
B000002IWQ|4.0|as with most rush albums once you start playing them you cant stop playing them.As most of my friends just want to hear MOVING PICTURES PART 10 all the time i say rush wouldnt be the trio they are now if they went along that road.Another fine album in the bag.
B0000C1733|2.0|This cd could have been [so] good if they put the good songs in it. Sure they have the song \\"fortune faded\\" which is new and good but still, so why do we call a greatest hits album \\"greatest hits\\"? It is because greatest hits album contains the most wanted songs from the fans ...NOT THE MUSIC INDUSTRY (...) So please save ur money and buy \\"Californication\\" or \\"Blood sugar sex majic\\".
B0001BKAEY|5.0|When the Matrix came out everyone was in awe of what we had seen. Nothing has ever been done like this before, and nothing will ever compare to the first. Then came the Matrix Reloaded, and my whole world was thrown upside down. The Matrix was incredible, but the Matrix reloaded was even better. Then came the Matrix Revolutions which blew them both out of the water. I am a huge Trilogy fan, and this is the greatest trilogy of them all, even better than the Lord of the Rings Trilogy( and that was fantatic). These movies are a milestone in cinema and will forever be with us. Thank you Andy and Larry Wachowski!
B000003TAB|4.0|Okay now lets get something straight! This album is only for hardcore Nirvana fans. If there's fans(like me) who likes Nirvana's 1st album &quot;Bleach&quot;, then they would like &quot;Incesticide&quot; too, there's no doubt about that. <BR>Kurt Cobain couldn't put all the songs in Bleach so he had to put them in Intestiside, but all the songs from Bleach and Incesticide were written together.
B0001GOH6Q|2.0|After seeing Big Fish on DVD, my first reaction was to wonder why so many people love the film. It's a story about Will, a grown man who has grown apart from his father, Ed. Will is constantly embarrassed in public by his father who insists on telling the most outrageous and unbelievable stories to everyone he meets. Will believes none of them, yet Ed insists they are completely true, and as a result Will feels like he doesn't know his father whatsoever. Ed is then diagnosed with a terminal illness, and the movie unfolds as Will tries to find out the truth about his dad. <br />While I heard there \\"wasn't a dry eye in the house\\" from everyone who saw it, the film just didn't move me. It's filled with somewhat clich?d and thinly veiled symbolism, and is permeated with inconsistent metaphors. It's sort of like Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind for idiots - people can leave feeling like they just actually enjoyed an \\"art\\" film that wasn't actually an art film. Here is how the film fails.<br />Early in the movie Ed sees how he is going to die, and realizes from that moment on he can survive anything. Everything except the audience's interest for the rest of the film - because he knows (and you know) throughout the movie that he isn't going to die until a certain point, he handles every situation with a completely drama-less attitude, knowing he'll live through it. He parachutes into the middle of a Japanese army, walks straight through the webs of poisonous spiders, robs a bank, faces a man-eating giant, etc. - all because he knows he won't die doing it. Therefore every scene is pretty much void of drama since you know he'll survive, and since he behaves recklessly knowing he'll survive as well. To me, that's a pretty boring hero. A hero is only heroic when there's real danger involved and Ed never faces real danger because he always knows he'll live through it. I just couldn't get behind him.<br />Besides this, he constantly abandoned his family - including the woman that he paylessly worked at a circus for three years to find because he \\"loved\\" her so much - to go on his little adventures. I don't really see how I can respect that in a character. He supposedly has the woman of his dreams, and then leaves her home alone so he can go fix up some other woman's house for her. Continuing with the characters, Will is a completely humorless jerk who treated his father badly. Furthermore, when will has his \\"transformation\\" at the end of the movie, there was really nothing to trigger it. Sure he had found some papers in his father's shed to validate some of the stories and he had talked to the woman from Specter, but there was nothing to suggest that he had totally been changed and bought into his father's philosophy. As a result, the ending felt like completely contrived schlock to me. It was just \\"time for character transformation in 3...2...1...now,\\" with no lead up to it at all. <br />There really isn't a conceivable story line to follow either. It just felt completely random and absurd. Perhaps that's what people liked about - for me, I prefer at least a semblance of story in a film. Burton just used gimmick after gimmick instead of telling a real story. We're hearing Jenny tell about Ed driving to Specter when he hit a severe thunderstorm, and then, while I foolishly expect a story to develop out of it, he's suddenly in his car at the bottom of a sea with a naked woman swimming around, then he's staring at his car up in a tree, presumably after the water has subsided. Just when it starts to shape into a story, something completely random and absurd happens, sending the movie spiraling deeper into contrived glitter-scenes, and apparently tricking the audience into believing they just saw something meaningful.<br />Based upon the gushing reviews of this film, even on amazon, it's hard to advise you not to see it. But if you do, try not to give in to the careful manipulation of Burton's devices and actually try to follow the film and what it's saying. In the end, it really isn't much. Basically, it's saying if you abandon your loved ones to pursue your own fantasies, everyone will love you in the end. I'm just not buying that.
B00005QDW5|3.0|Echoes is good but not great. The only Real good thing about the album is the liner notes. there are many &quot;Hits&quot; that are not on this album like &quot;Have A Cigar,&quot; and &quot;Brain Damage/Eclipse,&quot; Also they put a couple on there that really did not belong like &quot;Jugband Blues,&quot; and &quot;Bike,&quot; over all its ok.  I would recommend &quot;Pulse&quot; or &quot;Shine On,&quot; Audio is great, well mixed by James Guthrie.

B000002A3T|3.0|Roger Waters left the band in 1983 after major differences with David Gilmore, the Floyd went on to make a couple albums without Waters including 1994's \\"The Division Bell\\".  I must admit, I was surprised to hear the change of the  music style.  It was much different than albums like \\"The Wall\\", or \\"Dark Side Of The Moon\\". Though I have to admit that the mixing and the over all quality of the album was great to the ears. But there was something missing I felt.  And I was kind of disappointed at the \\"pop\\" style perfomance,  though I guess the Floyd was just keeping up with the times. Over all it was a good album, the cover was a good choice.

B000002OOY|5.0|OK.  Cards on the table; John Williams composes derivative Brahms.  Is that so bad?  He could do worse.  The fact is, as a student of music, and a lover of Brahms, hearing John Williams' modern compositions (Brahms derivatives that they are) from any of the movies he has composed for is a wonderful experience.  Williams is a master at the craft he does, and is probably one of the 3 or 4 greatest soundtrack composers ever ... my opinion.  As a young boy I bought the soundtrack to Jaws, loved it, studied classical music as an undergraduate and immediately recognised Brahms in Williams' work.  He was, for me, a sort of gateway into my enduring love of classical music.  I owe a lot to Mr. Williams.
B00005O5CM|3.0|Another cheer for the fast track method of success, in which self-esteem and formula tactics make up for inborn talent, this fun and refreshing comedy contains all the elements for an entertaining 2 hours.  It begins with a light and lively isn't-it-great-to-be-young introduction, complete with plenty of the colorful materialism typical of yuppie films to dazzle the viewer and convince them they can actually buy this fantasy life for themselves.  The characters are each interesting, realistic, and unique, and there's a delightful little dog, Breezer, whose name symbolizes much.  Miss Witherspoon as Elle Woods is absolutely charming; personality plus and a warm heart.  However, the story's attempt to mock male chauvinism with a reverse stereotype approach--you can be blonde, frivolous AND highly successful in the professions--fails because it quickly embraces the impossible super woman ideal, where you must be thin, beautiful, rich, young, and vivacious--to really get anywhere in the world (so why try otherwise, girls?).  Perhaps proof of the pudding are Miss Wood's scathing public putdowns of her powerful opponents that, while an admirable stand for higher values,  would burn your bridges before you start.
0783226063|3.0|Many reviewers here are bashing this movie, some of them not even giving reasons why. Here is the problem with the film, plain and simple: The book was simply too big to cram into a single movie. As a result, we get little character or story development, and the movie is probably confusing to anyone who hasn't read the book. But there are great moments too. The sandworms look great. The Harkonnens are really fun to watch (I only wish they had a lot more screen time) and the guild navigators with their microphone amplifiers look especially creepy.<br />But I'm sure most people reading these reviews have already seen the movie many times and have their opinion already. What you really want to know is, is this DVD edition worth buying? Unfortunately, it's pretty much just the movie here. Not much in the way of special features. Basically just text notes on the making of the film and biographies of the actors. If you have the VHS version, not much reason to get this DVD. And this is unfortunate, because many people forget that this film cost 40 million to make, which back in 1984 made it the most expensive film in history. So there must be plenty of deleted scenes we could have watched. Or how about a &quot;director's cut&quot; version which could have clarified the story a little? Kind of a missed opportunity here. For Dune fans, I recommend buying it along with the Sci-Fi channel version, to get a more complete vision of DUNE...
B000067J1H|5.0|Fight Club. Wow, what more can I say? It has to be one of the greatest films I have ever seen in my whole life for so many amazing reasons. It is a brilliantly-acted, superbly-portrayed, beautifully captured, complex masterpiece that was easily the film of 1999. Forget the Matrix and Star Wars for a minute and watch this. You'll soon see that special effects aren't everything and that all you need is a mind-blowing script like the one on display here to make a seismic impact. The film is riddled with dark humor and sharp quotes, violent action and emotional turmoil all of which result in the demise of one man's descent into madness as the approaching millennium beckons. Upon its release the film made a big impact by word-of-mouth, but was harshly snubbed by many award show judges. In the past five years, however, it has gone on to become an uncalculated masterpiece of the highest order that not only appeals to a wide audience, but teaches a strict lesson about the fabrication and consumer-obsessed society that we live in.<br /><br />Edward Norton plays Jack, a man on the verge of being the biggest loser in the world. With no friends or family and stuck in a dead-end job, he turns to victim support groups. The man suffers terrible insomnia and feeds off the depression that the other group members pour forth. His apartment later explodes, forcing him to turn to a man whom he first meets on a plane...<br /><br />The man is of course Tyler Durden (Brad Pitt) and in all his cocky arrogance and fast-paced way of life makes a big impression on Jack. Tyler is the complete embodiment of the guy who is bad, but we love him because of it. He steals fat from liposuction clinics which he makes into soap, before selling it back to the rich and fat ladies it once came from; urinates in the soup of the restaurant in which he works; and splices single frames of pornography into family movies. He has one main motivation in life: to disrupt social ethics and the way in which we live our lives. The people with the typical SUV, the 2.4 children and the idyllic lifestyle that everyone wants.<br /><br />The two man are complete opposites - day and night, as it were. Jack moves in with Tyler when his place is destroyed, and soon finds his life completely changing. When Jack gets talked into a fight with Tyler, he is amazed by how raw and primal he feels from inside. And the rest is history. \\"Fight Club\\" is formed, a secret underground society where men meet, one-on-one prepared to go head to head bare-knuckles style. The first rule of Fight Club is: \\"You do not talk about Fight Club.\\" The second rule is the same. You get the picture.<br /><br />Helena Bonham Carter is really fantastic as Marla, who is another fake visiting social victim groups when she meets Jack. She drives him crazy, and the rest of the plot is pretty much too hard for me to explain. I've only seen this film twice, bt I still have a hard time explaining what lies beneath it. The genius at work, director David Fincher, has created an intricate and glowing masterpiece that unfortunately gained a reputation as a guy-film because of the violence. It's anything but, and I encourage anyone who enjoys films such as American Beauty to watch it - not for the violence, but for the lesson you'll undoubtedly learn from society's fabrication.<br /><br />You can't really watch this film without seeing how beautifully-filmed it is. Filled with dark and brooding colours and tones of blues and blacks, we get a perfect view of the society in which Tyler and Jack inhabit. Most of the scenes take place at night and the run-down city just reflects the storyline completely. There's also the eye-candy on offer: I don't want to sound clich&eacute;, but Brad Pitt is just so beautiful in this film! There isn't a hotter man alive on the face of the Earth, and this factor alone makes it worth watching a million times, especially the scenes where he's in the bathtub, bedroom, dressing gown, etc. Yum yum!<br /><br />OVERALL GRADE: 10/10<br /><br />Fight Club was criticised because of its violence, but for me I can't really see what a fuss people were making of it. Yeah, it deserved its rating and it's not suitable for children, but I truly believe that there's nothing stomach-churning in this film that would make the faint-hearted squeamish! The film makes an impact right from the start and Jack's smart narration is a part of this completely. I haven't revealed the twist that this movie contains, but it's really smart and very well-done. Without knowning what this twist is, you might think that this is just another movie, but you'd be wrong. View it for what it is: a sharp and bright look at society and the ways in which we are told to live.0<BR> <BR>Fight Club was criticised because of its violence, but for me I can't really see what a fuss people were making of it.

B000003TA4|2.0|(...)I will start by saying that I admired Nirvana and I LOVED the new life that they injected into rock music in the early 90's. The problem is, this record just isn't what everyone makes it out to be. <br />Kurt Cobain was a lyrical genius, but some of the music on this record is absolutely impossible for anyone with a sense of pitch or timing to listen to. I know, I know, it's essentially a punk record, but a major-label debut album should have better songs on it, especially one that was hyped as much as this. <br />Kurt Cobain was a media darling from the beginning, initially because of his outspoken attitudes towards the macho-types and support of women and homosexuals, and later because of his train-wreck of a \\"family life\\" with Courtney Love, daughter Frances Bean and his first love (heroin). When he took his own life in 1994, he became something of a tragic hero, and as a result, much more importance has been attached to Nirvana's music than it deserves. Period.<br />\\"Smells Like Teen Spirit\\" and \\"Come As You Are\\" are the only songs worth having on this CD. If you want to hear some GOOD early-90's \\"grunge\\" (God, I STILL hate that word!), pick up Pearl Jam's \\"Ten,\\" Soundgarden's \\"Badmotorfinger,\\" or the one-off collaboration between those two bands, \\"Temple Of The Dog.\\"

B0001CNRS4|1.0|I rented this film because I like dance movies. I could barely sit through an hour of this film....if you can even call it that. Sure, Jessica Alba is gorgeous, but her acting skills leave something to be desired...The script is lousy, the dancing is good, but Alba's character is mindless...Needless to say I didn't finish watching the whole movie because I felt like every minute that went by I was losing more and more brain cells. If you want to see some good movies with better acting skills..not great...but some great dance moves..rent or buy Flashdance, Staying Alive, Dirty Dancing, Breakin' 2: Electric Boogaloo, and Save the Last Dance. Save your money on &quot;Honey.&quot;
B00003CXCT|5.0|If you haven't seen Star Wars Episode 4,5 and 6 then you should seriously consider watching these movies because they are some of the greatest science fiction movies ever created. In the 1980s, the original trilogy on VHS was considered the best science fiction trilogy ever. It still is, but the Star Wars Trilogy has been modified to make the movies look like they were released yesterday. Some people hate the modified version of the Star Wars Trilogy, but the modifications make this film enjoyable to watch on a GOOD home theater set up. The picture and sound quality of the VHS version of the original Star Wars trilogy is HORRIBLE. Anyway, the 1997 enhanced special effects make the environments and action more realistic than the 1977 special effects. This is a must have for any Star Wars fan.
006019250X|5.0|This book was actually given to me by a friend of my dad's friend from Barnes and Nobles.

Then, tonight, I started this story about a young shepard who only wanted to follow his dream. It was the most uplifting yet simple story I have ever read.
B00008DDXC|3.0|About 6 months after purchase and on the third usage the DVD developed the noise which is evidently hitting a small, but significant fraction of these products.  I wrote to Amazon hoping that they might have a longer warranty than the 3 months offered by a few manufacturers.  I would have been comfortable if they didn't.<br />However there was no sympathy.  Instead a form letter stating that the product could only be returned within a month, and indicating that the (defective) product could only be accepted if in perfect condition (!!!???) even within this month and also advice that I sell the (defective) product!<br />It was clear that the outsourced customer service couldn't parse my 3 sentences of simple English.  <br />A second message to Amazon was clearly misunderstood with an insistence that I include the original order number (which is supposed to be optional) and which I included in the first letter thus making it possible for any supervisor using a half competent computer system to follow the chain of events (I'm logged into Amazon when I'm writing these things, there have to be links and easy searches!)  <br />But they couldn't.  And it's clear by the canned text added that the second letter was also misunderstood and I was subjected to more irrelevant paragraphs which referred to my problem in the vaguest of terms while promising fevered concern!   Amazon has created a situation where they are going to lose customers.  I hoped but did not expect Amazon to replace a DVD which distorted due to manufacturing flaws (it was properly cared for,) but after 2 letters I had failed to reach anyone who could even grasp the situation.  <br />Thus I write here hoping it will be reviewed by someone who reads English and actually cares enough about the company to know they have a serious problem.  This new system may reduce the number of settlements the company makes because customers give up in frustration.  But those customers and their friends will not be back.  Wewant someone who can read email.

It is also a great introduction to people who don't quite understand the Blues.<br />BUT<br />when are we going to get it on DVD?  There is plenty of garbage that has been released on DVD, yet this movie continues to languish in VHS.  I spoke to a stallholder at the Sydney markets today who said he had had it in store as a dvd.  Well that has to be either crap or someone outside the Movie owner is transfering it to dvd.  The quality just would not be there. <BR>So how about it Columbia?
B0000TB014|5.0|I watched this DVD three or four times before I was able to put it away.  It hooks you as Michael pulls his audience into his performance! I enjoyed all the videos even from the beginning in &quot;Don't Stop till You Get Enough&quot; with all the big sparkling glass balls flying above his head, behind his back and rolling along the stage.  Then when I watched &quot;You Rock My World&quot; I thought to myself, this video is pure genius.  Only Michael Jackson could create such an entertaining video with an exciting beginning, middle and end, a love story - in the middle of a mob nightclub.  He falls for the girl of a gangster and to steal her away, he rocks the place with his song and dance moves.  He brings the house down with three other dancers.  If you have everything he owns, you'll still want this DVD.  I read the other reviews about the cuts in some of the videos, but so what.  This is the King of Pop and for the $13.00 I paid for this DVD, I would pay three times that just for &quot;You Rock My World.&quot;  Michael have some of his best dances moves in this video and he does it with grace and style, looking cool as usual.  He is the only performer that I have watched perform that can dance like there's no bones in his body while never breaking a sweat.
B0001WTUH6|4.0|This movie comes so close to achieving what both the Matrix and Star Wars did.  Taking a fairly low budget in comparison to most science fiction genere movies, and making a film that completley blows everything else away.<BR>I swear I thought this was going to be the next classic when I saw the brilliantly well made shot where Selene throws her shurikens, it was just beautiful.  <BR>Kate Beckinsale delivers an amazing performance with what could have easily been an otherwise one dimensional and boring character, it's a great credit to her talent and experience.  Some of the Cinematography is just awe inspiring.  But it doesn't quite achieve the greatness the above films did.  Although Kate Beckinsale's Performance was on the mark, there's not much to say about the rest of the cast with the possible exception of Bill Nigh, he did play a rather sinester vampire overlord well.<BR>Not that everyone else was terrible, but not exceptional either.  The biggest problem the acting suffers is between Speedman and Beckinsale though.  It's suppose to have the undertones of a love story, but as open as I was, and as much as I tried I just couldn't see any chemistry between them.<BR>I won't spoil the movie but one of the letdowns of the movie is it's final fight sequence.  It's not anticlimactic or anything, but it makes you kinda shake your head.  The entire movie seems to veer off course from it's original focus in the last fifteen minutes of the movie, and suddenly Beckinsale(The best part of the movie) no longer seems to be the focus of the film.<BR>Don't be discouraged though!  There's plentty of other fantastic portions which make it more than worthwhile.  This is a great science fiction/Action film that you should add to your collection.<BR>Also since there are plans for a prequal and sequal it would do good to see this chapter first.  Although this film didn't achieve true greatness it came very close, and now that the director has figured out what works and what doesn'tI think this series has definite potential.

B0000640VO|5.0|Amelie is a delectable little French pastry that, I imagine, only the most hardboiled of cynics could totally dismiss.  A treat for the mind, soul, eyes, &amp; ears: delicious interiors drenched in lush colors (mostly reds and greens), a spirited soundtrack (lots of zesty accordion - but don't let you that put you off), an amusing cast of quirky characters, enchanted - and some rather disenchanted - romance, and a dash of intriguing mystery.<br />Young Amelie is a shy doe-like creature, the hapless offspring of two human oddities. One day she is struck with a revelation when she discovers a little boy's long lost box of treasures hidden in a secret compartment in her bathroom. Once she anonymously returns the item to the boy, who by now is middle-aged, and witnesses from afar his joy, she sets out on a quest to right the wrongs of her fellow human beings (even imagining herself as Zorro in one scene).<br />Along the way, Amelie stumbles across her soul mate who devotes much of his time scavenging for discarded strips of photos from photo booths and saving them in a scrapbook. Hmmmm, interesting hobby, oui? But will Amelie ever muster up the courage to actually encounter him face to face?<br />Ah, and what does Princess Diana's death have to do with any of these shenanigans? And who is the Glass Man and why does he paint the same thing over and over again? Who is the bald man in the red sneakers who seems obsessed with having his photo taken yet never keeps any of them? Will the nitwit with the tape recorder ever stop stalking Gina? Can anything cure Georgette's many maladies? Why would Suzanne rather eat human flesh than horse flesh? What happened to papa's garden gnome? And what on earth is hidden beneath the artichoke?<br />Watch this movie, folks, and find out the answers to these captivating enigmas and more. So so much more. I truly don't believe you'll be sorry.

B000003TA4|1.0|I sure whomever commented Cobain's suicide was a &quot;brave death&quot; actually meant &quot;most cowardly, self-centered death&quot;, I'm sure. Even John Lydon (whom Kurt was inspired by and based his Punk Ethos on) thinks people shouldn't say Cobain was a &quot;sensitive soul&quot; because he took himself away from those who loved him. Lydon even wanted to work with Cobain, but that dream was (literally) shot to peices. He killed himself because he had the types of fans found here who gave Nevermind five stars and wouldn't let him live in peace and kept expecting him to churn out Nevermind II, III, etc. And now all we're left with is a rock album most people don't dare to question on any terms. I think we definitely should be questioning the quality of Nevermind, and how it was just a cut &amp; paste job (Vig took the best takes from the band and constructed songs ala Dr. Frankenstein). We should also be questioning Nirvana and the horrible bands this record has &quot;inspired&quot;, because he could've saw to it that this kind of agonizingly-dishonest &quot;grunge revival&quot; wasn't happening if he was still alive. We could've had Cobain become a folk singer for godsakes! That's where he wanted to take his music! And I would've enjoyed it! If Kurt would've had fans that appreciated diverse music, and accepted change, he probably would've been able to create music he was happy with instead of pandering to the likes of the people here that endlessly praise the silly, emptyheaded rock of Nevermind.

B0001NBMEE|3.0|20th Century Fox Home Entertainment released this DVD on May 11, 2004. For anyone who's a fan of the Cinemascope era of the studio, this DVD is a must have. The movie itself is a silly contrivence of the time, based on a popular comic strip, as the illustrations during the main titles show, but it's all well-mounted with excellent photography and a Franz Waxman score that's a prime example of how a composer can really elevate the atmosphere and pace of a movie. The depiction of the era of the story is cardboard, with everyone and nearly everything looking too pretty and well-manicured -- no grubby surfs are anywhere to be seen, and even the comicbook Vikings are too clean -- but it's fun at its own level, even if today the movie's pace is a bit slow. My only complaint is that top-billed star James Mason isn't in more of it. The actor and his character are far more interesting to watch than the story's protagonist and the stiff, young Robert Wagner sporting a silly wig!<br />Fox has done a decent job of restoration on this 1954 Technicolor film. While the look is dated and the film stock is more grainy than we're used to today, the majority of it looks remarkably good. I suspect much of it was newly struck from the black and white color separation masters, but the frequent lap desolves have the second generation look of excessive grain and poorer color fidelity. There's one bad anomaly in the transfer at 24min.15sec., a 15 second shot that looks to be third generation. It's soft, grainy and blocked-up. Except for a couple rear projection shots elsewhere in the movie, nothing else in the transfer looks this bad. Otherwise this is a fine looking 16X9 anamorphic DVD of a vintage Cinemascope film.<br />Originally this movie was presented in some theatres in 1954 in 4-track magnetic stereo.  Here, what survives of the stereo tracks is presented in Dolby Digital 2.0 (not 5.1 as stated in another review here). I'd have preferred if Fox had gone to the efforts of doing a proper 4.0 transfer, but the stereo still sounds good, with the directional dialogue of the era intact, though it can be a bit distracting when left and right speakers are too far from the screen (in theatres the speakers would of course be behind the screen).  I found I had to raise the dB level of my rear surrounds to +10 in order to bring out the ambient sound of the film, mostly reserved to the music, but at 1:27min.21sec., when pig fat is used to light fires during the siege of the castle, the mono surround did come alive with fire noise and that was fun.<br />I'm only giving this DVD three stars because Fox didn't have enough faith (and they may be right) in this library title's marketability to include a commentary track by star Wagner, or a least some feature on the film's production history, and because the sound wasn't remixed for 4.0, but if you're a fan of such films I highly recommend this DVD.

B00005ATQI|5.0|The real horror of The Shining lies in the film's hidden messages.  Knowing that Stanley Kubrick used film genres (e.g., terror) as a means to an end-to show audiences larger social, cultural, and even cosmic truths (e.g., 2001: A Space Odyssey)-one can see that this is more than a regular \\"horror flick.\\"  This is what separates this director from most, who simply direct movies for their entertainment value.  <br />In The Shining, Kubrick shows us a horror larger than that of a writer (Jack Nicholson) who, one winter, disintegrates mentally and tries to kill his wife Wendy (Shelley Duvall) and son Danny (Danny Lloyd) with an ax at a deserted resort hotel in Colorado.  Sure, this is part of the terror, and the fact that Jack actually murders Dick, the hotel chef (Scatman Crothers), at the end after the clairvoyant cook follows his instinct regarding the need for him to travel from Florida to Colorado to check up on the family.  <br />But dehumanization, the flick's leitmotif, involves much more than that, and the other horrors that occur throughout the film are what contribute to the mayhem at the end.  The truly terrifying aspect of this film is that these horrors affect us all day-to-day-at least, those who live in contemporary America.  These horrors are too numerous to describe here.  But the most serious involve separate, disparate elements of modern living, and yet, elements that are strangely interrelated.  First, the genocide of Native Americans surfaces repeatedly in the film (e.g., Indian rugs everywhere, Indian pipettes on kitchen cans, Wendy's braids, Indian background music, a rushing river of blood gushing from elevator doors, etc.).  The luxurious hotel is also called the Overlook, a literal name for a lavish America built on an Indian burial ground, which continues to \\"overlook\\" the fact that the United States was built at the expense of Native American blood-not to mention that of blacks.  Second, the film's large, empty hotel both symbolizes and reifies the same isolation of the typical, suburban, middle-class American family-the nuclear family literally light years apart from neighbors and community (e.g., most neighbors don't even know one another's names).  Furthermore, this real-life isolation is not just inside suburban homes-empty as the Overlook's interior-but outside on neighborhood streets and sidewalks, except for a car or two swooshing by.  In turn, America's isolation from the world relates as well to the Overlook's isolation.  Third, the film is about the illusion of middle-class ownership.  In The Shining, Jack and Wendy appear to own the hotel-having it all to themselves, but in reality they are merely employees, owning nothing.  Fourth, the movie is about the historical brutalization (not just genocide) of minorities-Wendy's victimhood representing the real-life equivalent of women, Dick's the equivalent of black Americans, and Danny's the equivalent of children.  <br />The film isn't perfect, and one of its most disappointing aspects is the climax, when Jack-other than outside the bathroom-never really gets close to Wendy with the ax.  Had this happened, the film would have REALLY had a suspenseful climax.  Another serious disappointment is the lumping of homosexuality at the end (e.g., the bedroom's \\"gay\\" scene) with the other horrors of the hotel (e.g., the ghoulish man dripping with blood, the roomful of skeletons, etc.).  Unfortunately, this lumping of homosexuality with creepy things is common, even nowadays, in film, TV, and writing, and the fact that this happens in a highly thought-out movie is an even bigger horror.  Because people generally accept well-presented things uncritically (e.g., a visually flawless movie), it is imperative that incidents like Kubrick's depiction of gayness in The Shining be viewed and spoken about with critical eyes.<br />Most viewers who ask, \\"What was that movie about?\\" have simply failed to see the hidden meanings of this film, but once uncovered, this film makes perfect sense.<br />Other than that, The Shining is one of the best filmed and acted movies in the history of moviemaking (e.g, the Steadicam scenes, the meticulous camera shots, Nicholson's snarls and facial expressions, etc.).  Highly recommended!

0792844602|5.0|Alexander Korda's \\"The Four Feathers\\" (1939) is perhaps one of the greatest triumphs of British filmmaking -- a crowning achievement in Imperialistic propaganda and a nostalgic testimony to the societal traditions which once inhibited us as individuals. Simply put, \\"The Four Feathers\\" is a cinematic masterpiece in the vein of \\"The Drum\\" (1938), \\"Kim\\" (1950), \\"The Jungle Book\\" (1942) and \\"Gunga Din\\" (1939). It also represents a rare instance in which a film is far superior to the original novel.<br /><br />The original novel upon which the film is loosely based was penned by A.E.W. Mason and has an actual excuse for being somewhat flimsy: Following the bloody outbreak of World War I, Mason wrote the story as a mere identity cover while doing espionage work for the British government. He was able to scout northern Africa under this guise of an accomplished author gleaning material for the plot of the novel.<br /><br />The plot of \\"Four Feathers\\" is simple yet engrossing: A young man, Harry Faversham (the dashing John Clements), is brought up by his distant father (Allan Jeayes) in a lonely household steeped in Imperial tradition which values courage and honor above happiness or life itself. His natural human instinct of self-preservation is accentuated into possible cowardice by the horrifying war stories told around the dinner table by old veterans. As he matures, Faversham falls deeply in love with Ethne Burroughs (the radiantly beautiful June Dupr&eacute;z) and decides that he would rather spend his life in his own way than be trapped in the futile repetitiveness that is a soldier family. On the eve of his unit sailing for Africa, he resigns his commission and is branded a coward -- one of the worst labels in Victorian England -- by both his friends and his betrothed. To reclaim his honor and prove both to himself and others that he is not a coward, Faversham sails to darkest Africa.<br /><br />In Africa, our dauntless hero is embroiled in unfolding military history as General/Lord Horatio Kitchner ventures into the blistering Sudan with 20,000 British personnel against the varied 50,000 warriors of the Khalifa (John Laurie). The film terrifically climaxes in the breathtaking Battle of Omdurman, a historical engagement which a young Winston S. Churchill witnessed and, in one of his most famous literary pieces, fittingly described as a \\"victory snatched from the jaws of peril!\\"<br /><br />When I was very young, my parents would show me this particular film as an example of a forgotten way of life: of lavish ballrooms where uniformed officers and young ladies in ornate Victorian gowns danced the night away on the eve of war amidst whispered pledges of love and marriage. The film taught me that a true gentleman never insults another in public; a leader must be able to command his own self before he can command others; to honor your word even if it may kill you in the process and to be unafraid of whatever befalls you as long as you are true to yourself.<br /><br />Film Rating: ***** (five) out of ***** (five) stars.<br />A mesmerizing period piece.hner ventures into the blistering Sudan with 20,000 British personnel against the varied 50,000 warriors of the Khalifa (John Laurie).

B00005RFQ5|5.0|First of all those supposed fans who say this is Prince's worst album I would have to completely disagree.  Diamonds And Pearls is his worst in my opinion.  Remember, Strollin, Jughead, Push, Walk Don't Walk, Thunder, Daddy Pop, etc.  I don't know anybody that likes those songs.  Thats half of that album.  Remember those songs and how pathetic they were in every way.  <br />Let's get to the rainbow children.  Awesome concept/story album.  Prince hadn't really done that since the love symbol album really.  Yeah this album is preachy and possibly religiously offensive at times to some.  Musically it takes you on a journey.  It's psychadelic, jazzy, funky and also rocks on occasion.  My only complaint about this album is I think the deep manipulated computer voice is overdone.  At times it distracts from the music, but obviously it is supposed to play a key role on this album otherwise Prince would not have used it.  I had not idea what to expect from this album.  I really didn't know much about it when I bought it, but being a die hard Prince fan bought it with an open mind and was pleasantly surprised. <br />I won't review all of the songs, but I will comment on some:<br />1. Rainbow Children  great song but the weird voice is to prominent in this song, and it can't seem too long at times if you are not in the mood for a long song.  It's over 10 minutes long.<br />2. Muse 2 the Pharoah  a great song especially on One Night Alone Live.  Live versions of most Prince songs are better except when he doesn't sing all the words to the songs or makes them shorter.<br />3. Digital Garden  <BR>4. The Work Pt.1  <BR>5. Everywhere  <BR>6. The Sensual Everafter          <BR>7. Mellow          <BR>8. 1+1+1 is 3          <BR>9. Deconstruction          <BR>10. Wedding Feast          <BR>11. She Loves Me 4 Me          <BR>12. Family Name          <BR>13. The Everlasting Now          <BR>14. Last December  <br />If I had more time I would review more of the songs.  Let me say that ifyou are a die hard Prince fan you'll probably like this album.  If you aren't but like story/concept albums or just looking for something to take you on a journey check this out.  This isn't his best, but it's certainly not his worst.  This is one of the most unique albums he's ever done.  I don't think he'll draw in any new listeners with this album because most people probably won't even hear it except for us \\"rainbow children\\" :) (that's what he calls the audience on his one night alone tour).  I have found that some Prince albums have to grow on me and others don't.  This one still has to grow on me to an extent.  It might have to grow on you too so don't judge it from one or two listens, give it several before you judge.  Sorry this review isn't very good, but hopefully it might be helpful to some.
B0001AVZA8|3.0|\\"Something's Gotta Give\\" is about an aging bachelor who is so accustomed to dating women half his age that once he meets a sexy and sophisticated peer of his the romance hits a sour note. This film was a dissapointment overall to me, the fault of which lies in its writing and directing. Jack Nicholson gave a great performance, and Diane Keaton deserved her Oscar nomination (and maybe even deserved to win), but try as they might they could not save the film. <br />My dissapointment in the film is so because the first half was so good. It is very fresh and funny, then things all go downhill. The film loses its wit, and the story's devices (the young doctor as only an obstacle to Henry and Erica, the daughter as only a way for them to get together) become very apparent. The ending had no originality or chutzpah in any way, and the corny dialogue made it a groaner. I give three stars for the first half, but still reccomend it if you need a nice and airy romantic comedy.
B00000099Y|3.0|Recently I bought Aenima after some persuasion from my friends, who told me tool was the best band ever. Just to see if I could find a band better than sevendust of killswitch I bought it with high hopes of finding that one great band. When I opened the cd case I saw something strange on the cd itself. I looked closer and, WHOA! There was a guy sucking his own member! I don't know if this was supposed to be funny or gross, but I do know tool might have some problems.  Not that I was offended, but it just weird. <BR>I pop the cd in forgeting about what was on it, and I start listening. The first track was good, noticable bass, and tool seemed to know what they were doing. When I started the second song I waited through 60 seconds of filler then fast forwarded to the beggining of the actual song. I did this through all the songs since tool doens't understand that no or little sound at the begginning of a song is good for one song, but after that it is only filler. Plus there are only seven true songs, the rest are just fillers with talking or the normal slow insturmentation of tool. Plus on the Denver metal station these guys are way overplayed, which makes them slightly annoying. Another thing is that their true songs sonud alike, which isn't bad for me, but it could make some people angry.<BR> Truthfully this may not be my style of music. I am mostly a hardcore, metalcore, nu-metal, and occasional death and black metal listener. I don't know where to classify tool so I'm not even going to try. The truth is that if this had been a seven song EP it would have been a five star review, but the fillers just killed this cd. So if you like darker nu-metal you might enjoy this, but if you like heavier metal you probably will not. So in final, this cd was alright, but it shouldn't have had all the fillers.
B0000DD7LB|3.0|&quot;HOT, HOT, HOT!&quot;<br />&quot;I love this type of music!&quot;<br />What in the world is going on? Are you the same person posting multiple reviews in one day, with the same paraphrased review titles? I'm not attacking you for it. If you are, good for you!<br />I don't for one second doubt that you are. Hail to the brother or sister that pointed that out. I thought twice before doing so myself, but when I read that review, (and you'll know which one I'm talking about) I said, &quot;What in the world? Let's do it&quot; and I pressed the button to start my review.<br />I love the album. I only dislike Tracks &quot;Outrageous&quot; and &quot;Brand New Girl&quot; The rhythm and the beats and the lyrics are a whistle blowing directly into my ears. I am not going to attack Britney's persona because I am not that kind of girl. I am reviewing Britney's work, not Britney, so, other than those songs, the album's cool and great and all you want, but I've got some advice... Singing racy songs is not what shows maturity. Real maturity's about having learned from your mistakes, improving yourself, making yourself more presentable, knowing how to address the public and how to present yourself to the public, and last but not least, living a healthy lifestyle. That goes to all singers out there.<br />Bye my friends.<br />Magaly.
1401300901|4.0|I have to say that I really liked this book!  It really took a different look at coping with the loss of a loved one.  The story follows a character, Holly, who recently lost her husband at a very young age.  The book follows her and her close friends through the year that follows.  Holly has received notes from her husband, one for each month, that are intended to help her move on with her life, in a positive direction.<br />I was amazed how on one page I was crying and at the next I was laughing, and two pages later crying again!  My only disappoinment with the book is that the age of the author can be seen in some immature aspects of the book, such as the partying and drinking of the characters.  However, it is still a great read, and I would recommend it to any female looking for a unique, quick read!
0385336810|5.0|Sophie Kinsella is one of my absolute favorite authors.  Her characters are extremely well developed and her stories keep you hanging on as if you were reading a thriller.<br />I was a bit apprehensive about reading this book since it wasn't about Becky Bloomwood but it was just as good.  Emma Corrigan, who works for the Panther Corporation, has a brief encounter with the president of the company on an airplane.  She spills out her deepest, darkest secrets to him, not knowing he's the president.  When she finally meets him at Panther, she realizes that she's falling for him and vice versa.  This was such a fun, romantic book.  I couldn't put this book down.  I just wish the ending was a bit longer so I could read more about Emma &amp; Jack.  Hopefully there will be a Part 2.
B000148KK2|3.0|I've been a fan of Diana Krall since her second album &quot;All For You&quot; and while I don't feel her newest CD is her best work, I do think it's better than a lot of reveiwers at Amazon are giving it credit for.  I think that in order to have a career that is capable of spanning decades Diana does need to cover non-jazz tunes as well as recording originals.  I think with this CD that perhaps she has jumped into new waters too soon and that it would serve her better to slowly begin working in newer material along with standards rather than jump 100% into it.<br />I think about 60-70% of the album works well, but the rest of the songs don't fit well with her style.  And I feel that the influence of her collaborator and husband Elvis Costello can be felt too strongly in several of the songs (of course I've never been a fan of his work so that may taint my opinion somewhat.)<br />Overall, while this ablum is not her best, it is certainly not her worst (I'm not crazy about her first album Only Trust Your Heart) and many of the songs that I initially disliked have begun to grow on me with repeated listenings of the album.
B0000C6E4D|5.0|I happen to enjoy all of her slower songs from previous albums, and this particular album is pretty much made up of entirely that style. In many ways I give Sarah an A+ in merging the generational gap with music that effectively and enjoyably plays to the many different audiences. She doesn't confuse her tempos, rather she has honest lyrics and a wonderful way of bringing them to music. Her vocals are always beautiful and seemingly pensive and heartfelt with regard to what she is singing. Good job, Sarah!
B0000C8AVR|5.0|&quot;Highway 61 Revisited&quot; should be on every &quot;Top Ten non-classical recordings of the 20th century&quot; lists, for many reasons: Its courage and innovation, and the influence it had on the music of its time, and for the impact it continues to have; the strength of its strange but potently poetic lyrics, and the quality of its musicianship; and most of all, because it is fabulous listening.<br />Dylan turned the musical world on its head when he went &quot;electric&quot;, and the musicians he assembled to back him are legendary; Michael Bloomfield, guitar / Al Kooper, organ &amp; piano / Paul Griffin, piano and organ / Bobby Gregg, drums / Harvey Goldstein, bass / Charley McCoy, guitar / Frank Owens, piano / Russ Savakus, bass. The music they make sounds as fresh today as when I first heard it four decades ago; everyone will have their favorites, mine are &quot;Ballad of a Thin Man&quot; and &quot;Tombstone Blues&quot;, but all nine tracks are brilliant and powerful.<br />Fortunately CBS/Sony has released this CD in the same format as the original LP, with Dylan's incomprehensible but terrific liner notes (&quot;On the slow train time does not interfere...&quot;), and with no extra tracks to ruin the feel of the music. It is a recording that is like clear water when compared to the stagnant musical times we live in, and no CD collection is truly complete without it. The sound is excellent and total playing time is 51'37.
B000002JKA|4.0|This was my first Dream Theater, which I got around last year.  It is a great album with some awesome songs and always outstanding John Petrucci solos.  The highlights on this album are definitely &quot;Erotomania&quot;, &quot;Voices&quot;, &quot;Lie&quot;, and &quot;Space-Dye Vest&quot;.  There are other great songs like &quot;6:00&quot; and &quot;The Mirror&quot; which are all great.  Jame's voice sounds good on this album, but maybe not quite as good as &quot;Images and Words&quot;.  The songs on this album lack the magic of the songs on albums like &quot;Scenes From A Memory&quot; or &quot;Images and Words&quot;, but it still a must have for any progressive metal fan.
B00006BTCA|4.0|\\"gonna pull you in close; <BR>gonna wrap you up tight; <BR>gonna play with the braids that you came here with tonight; i'm gonna hold your face and toast the snow that fell.\\"<br />The energy on this album has an almost poignant intimacy.  It's downtrodden at times, but every once in awhile it will smile through the speakers.  I wish I could be the girl about whom these songs were written.  Must have been SOME girl.  Either that, or delusions of romantic grandeur.    <br />If you're feeling like a condescending indie rock snob these days (and it's easy to fall into that habit, I know), focus strictly on music and criticize for patterns of unoriginality.  There are plenty of them.  You can even *drink* every time you hear a drum loop or riff that *sounds* like Band XYZ.   And if you feel the tears coming on, go ahead...feel free to cry to your Joy Division collection and worship your Smiths shrine.  <br />But that doesn't change the fact that you simply can't buy enough sad sucker leather jackets to hang from all the hooks on this album.  Furthermore, most emo-core folklore is blown out of the water by some of the lovely, wistful poetry you'll find blossoming in the most unlikely places.  Turn on the bright lights, and you'll see them.
B000001IQH|5.0|This is a must have for any Rancid fan or any fan of punk music. Hands down, this is the best Rancid album. There is not much to say but check this out.
B00000JLWW|5.0|This movie is brilliant and beautiful. 10 strars for the movie, but 1 star for the DVD...but the special edition DVD is coming out late 2004, so it's all good! Highly reccommended.
