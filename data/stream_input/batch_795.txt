B000TGJ7ZY|4.0|There are many reviewers who have already discussed the artistic merits (and more) of this film - I thought it was amazing from the first time I saw it in a theater. My question is about the audio on the Blu-ray edition. I have a superbit version of this film and on my system, the audio is much more pleasing on the standard DVD. I wonder if anyone else has noticed that the levels and EQ in some parts of the film leave a lot to be desired - compared to other releases or even the special features...
B0019FOC5E|5.0|I can't remember the last movie I saw that my face was tired from smiling and I wished they had seat belts on the movie theater seats because I was twitching to jump up and dance and sing.  I thought the movie and the soundtrack were both terrific!  And oh, to relive this era....<br />The theater production has not been in my town, but I'm planning to go to Vegas to see it!<br />PS.  I would describe as a chick flick. The only part my guy would have liked was the last scene with the guys and their 70's dance moves - that's because that's how my guy still dances!
B00005JPY0|2.0|Heath Ledger is dead, and this is the role that, more or less, lead to his death.  He showed promise with Brokeback Mountain and in The Dark Knight he cements the fact that he was more than just that guy from that teen movie that was based on a work by Shakespeare, but it won't happen.    Oddly enough, this isn't the only saddening part about the film; pretty much every aspect is, other than Ledger's pitch perfect performance.  It needs to be said: Christian Bale cannot act; ok he did a marvelous job in The Prestige, but that's a one time deal apparently.  He's a horrid batman, not as bad as Clooney, but he's still unwatchable.  Batman's supposed to have a gruff voice, I know this, but it's not supposed to sound like he's belching his lines, it's that simple.    For a film that's over 2 hours long it sure promised a lot, built up a great deal of expectations and then just completely fizzled by the end of it.    I'm sick of Morgan Freeman always, ALWAYS, playing the same role; the old wise man with an insightful perspective and reserved manner; does the man have no range?  Please, someone give me a pointer to a film where he doesn't do the same old.  Maggie Gyllenhall was absolutely awful as well, my lord, the bad performances are everywhere, so much so that they basically could have just edited it to the point where it's all Ledger's show and nothing else.    The directing was nothing special, the story wasn't anything they couldn't have fit into a 23 minute episode of the cartoon, and the attempt to resonate a deep philosophical perspective is marred by the fact that it's just not well written or acted or directed.  For an action film it certainly was incredibly tedious and unbearably slow.    Nobody better try to feed me anything about this being a character study, or a comic book movie for adults; because it's not, you're fooling yourself if this is your frame of mind.  It's a popcorn movie, a summer cash in, and nothing more; well, there's the cornerstone of nihilism that is The Joker, but other than that you're better off watching Killer Klowns from Outer Space.
0385340567|2.0|What a disappointment.  If you are a Jack Reacher fan forget this one.  I can't believe that I actually found a Reacher novel to be boring, so  ill conceived and filled with a bunch of nonsensical, technical diatrabe.    I think that Lee Child should get back on track and forget about trying to use his novels to bore us with his political nonsense and idealism.  I hope we don't find that his next novel has Jack headed to the democratic national convention.  Bring back the old Jack.
0375842381|1.0|[...]<br /><br />The trilogy starts promisingly, and I was quite happy with the first book. It reads like an allegory of our own world. I am an atheist/agnostic and have very little sympathy for the catholic church, so I found some of these themes quite appealing and interesting. But as the story progresses in the second book the characters start getting more shallow, and less interesting and the story starts getting illogical twists that just seem to make no sense in the context of the story line, the plot seems to follow the whims of the writer and not it's own inner logic that the first book promisingly build up. The third book continues this trend. Nothing makes sense anymore. And don't understand this wrongly. A fantasy story doesn't have to \\"make sense\\", but it has to follow it's own set of rules or the storyline is shattered. When the rules are broken the reader starts feeling he's being manipulated. While the world of the first book was full of life, promise, hope, wonder and achievement when the world was on the brink of a great war and children were being kidnapped, the ending of the third book is the emotional opposite - after the universe has been saved.<br />[...]The third book is just horrible. One of the worst endings I have ever read.<br /><br />Not recommended reading for children. I don't mind the anti-catholicism angle, but the way the reader is manipulated and how imagination and wonder are cruelly restricted is not a message of freedom. Completely puzzled how the second and third book have generally got good reviews.

160459201X|5.0|This is an old book which is excellent for taking control of your life.  The author is well known and well educated in metaphysics, religion and the understanding of True Religion.  He is a very SAFE writer for any age desiring to improve their lives.  I was very, very disappointed by the publisher's statement that the book was racist, and so many other negative terms. The publisher stated that it was a book of \\"his\\" time and should be carefully checked if children were to read this book.  Truth is eternal.  No book that Joseph Murphy ever wrote was racist or harmful.  I pray that there will be a different publisher of Dr. Murphy's book.  I met him when he was alive, attended many of his seminars and found him to be a deep thinker, honest, always in integrity and a very gentle individual.  Too bad the publisher never got to meet him.

038073186X|1.0|This book is well written, yes. At several points it had me frightened, and caught between dying to turn the next page and too scared to. It got my blood pumping, got me angry, I think, as it was intended to. I cared about Teddy, and I really liked Chuck. Cawley and Naehring were delightfully mysterious and sinister. A number of the surprises were fairly organic and quite shocking.<br /><br />I know what you're thinking. How did this idiot manage to click one star, when he's obviously writing a five star review. You would be right to think this. However, you are wrong. This is a one star review, and here's why:<br /><br />DO NOT READ THE BACK OF THE BOOK!!!!!!! To any person with half a brain (I know, not THAT many people have that much of a brain) the book description will give it ALL AWAY.<br /><br />DO NOT READ THE BLURBS IN THE BOOK!!!!!!! To any person with half a brain that can add, after reading the back of the book, two and two, will immediately get four.<br /><br />If you read these, you will know EXACTLY what's going to happen within the first couple of pages. And it will make you mad, just waiting for it, hoping that, praying that, this isn't the case. Its a trick. Please, God, let it be a trick. Its not. That's what's going to happen.<br /><br />Now, for those that have NOT read the back of the book or any of the blurbs. You will have a little more fun. You will enjoy the first fourth of the book. Then you'll know too. You'll know exactly what's going to happen. Maybe you'll be like me. You'll think its a trick. A red herring. Again, I say, ITS NOT!!!!!!!!<br /><br />Scorsese's movie I know will be good. Perhaps he and the screenwriter will think up a way to make the ending more organic. But, I don't think that's possible. Regardless, I can't wait to see how atmospheric and shocking the movie will be. I mean, look at what Eastwood did with Mystic River. The book was good, yes, but my God, man, not in a thousand universes could coincidences stack up like that. When everything fits like a jigsaw puzzle, you lose large amounts of realism, and tend to make people weary, and you take a lot of the punch out of it. But Eastwood's film had a transcendence to it (I'm picturing the scene at the end where Sean Penn has his arms spread like a shrugging Christ as he drinks his way from all this. . . coincidence). And Scorsese is at least twice the filmmaker Eastwood is. So, here's hoping. . . . . .you lose large amounts of realism, and tend to make people weary, and you take a lot of the punch out of it.

B0009MAO46|3.0|I wasn't quite sure how to rate this movie.  I have always been a fan of Disney movies and this one just did not feel good like other ones.      The story is about two toys getting lost, and found by a bad boy who mistreats toys (for example, he cuts off the heads of toy figures and puts the heads in lava lamps to float around).  The two toys who got lost in the first place hate each other until the end of the movie, so they are bickering the whole time while trying to escape the dark atmosphere of the bad boy's room.  Of course every story has an antagonist that generates an antagonistic feeling, I feel that TOO much of this movie was spent in the dark atmosphere.  All the name-calling between Woody, Buzz, Potato Head, etc just bugged me.  The end of the story turns out wonderful, of course, and some of the scenes are really fun and heartwarming -- but really I don't get a good feeling from this movie in general.    It's not something I particularly like my kids watching.  I cringe every time my 3-year-old asks to see \\"The Buzz Movie.\\"  He LOVES Buzz, who is the main \\"good guy\\" in the movie, and I let him have a Buzz-decorated bedroom at his request.  But I limit how much he can actually watch this movie and try to counter it with more generally positive movies like Cars, Finding Nemo, or shows on Noggin.
B000WGWQG8|5.0|I happily give this mini-series five stars. This epic tale of John Adams covers the beginning, middle and end of his life. It not only tells of the well known historical areas of his life. But the happy and sad areas of his life and all those that touched his life. The remarkable wife and best friend, Abagail Adams, stands by him through thick and thin. George Washington, Thomas Jefferson, Dr. Benjamin Franklin and so many, many more come to life for us thanks to HBO Films and Play Tone. I recommend that anyone who loves our roots and our beginnings to buy this epic mini-series.  This is the America we are supposed to be.
B001CD6FKI|5.0|The thing about the live action Speed Racer film is that it was something different that I had not seen before which is what I look for in a movie.  The Wachowski Brothers truly made something awesome here and because of equally great Iron Man film Speed Racer did not see the numbers it should have.  Last summer the two hit movies where Spider-Man(3) and Transformers, put them together and you have Iron Man this year.  Granted I enjoy all those movies and happen to be a huge Transformer fan but Speed Racer was just the movie that deserved better because it was at it's heart a good family movie and stood outside the standard formula of films you see these days.    So once more the Wachowski Brothers created a great film here that should be seen by everyone even if you have no idea what the Speed Racer cartoon was.  Humor, action, cars and a family story the movie has it all.  Do yourself a favor and pick up this movie because it may not have seen the numbers on the big screen but I should at the least see something on DVD.
B0000041XX|5.0|I respectfully agree yet disagree with Ms Barbara Eisner who wrote the review of the 3 Tenors 1990 concert. She is right that Carreras was not  on par with the other 2 but that is only because at this late stage in his (Carreras) career he was not in the very fine voice he once was due to overuse of his voice and his battle with leukemia, which he valiantly won!. If you could appreciate, as I do,Carreras' 1970's richly-gorgeous and velvety voice in recordings of operas such as Lucia, La Boheme, Donizetti and liter Verdi operas you would have seen his mid 70's peak voice would have been every been as excellent as Domingo and Pavarotti were in the 3 Tenors 1990 concert. In fact, I dare to say he would have blown both men out of the water..with the possible exception of Pavarotti singing Nessun Dorma. Just listen to Carreras singing with Caballe on youtube in Adriana Lecrouveur and Tosca and you'll see what I mean!!!

B00005JPY0|4.0|Dark Knight picks up where Batman Begins left off--the mansion is being rebuilt and for now Bruce, Alfred, Lucius, and all of Batman's gadgets have moved into a city penthouse.  (Incidentally, Dark Knight was filmed in Chicago, as was Wanted).  While the first movie established the Caped Crusader's origins and spiritual training (loved that part), Dark Knight gets right down to the business of fighting villains.<br /><br />\\"Saving Harvey Dent\\" could be an accurate alternative title for the Dark Knight.  After all, most of the movie focuses on trying to protect Dent from the murderous attempts of the Joker.  If you're thinking that there must be something corrupt lurking under Aaron Eckhardt's square jaw and blonde good looks, well, you're right.<br /><br />The heroes and villains (at least the big ones) are clearly drawn enough, but there's a lot going on and the Joker orchestrates all of it.  The special FX are fantastic.  I loved the way they flipped the 18-wheeler, a 40 foot long trailer.  I liked the Joker's character best.  Once you've had a brush with a sociopath you recognize them immediately and the Joker's lines are true to form.  Of course his actions scream maniac, but some of his best acting is when he's not blowing things up.  True to psychopath form his goal is to elicit an emotional response from the normal folk around him and that response is not warm or fuzzy.  We see the Joker sitting in a holding cell, all hell breaking loose around him and he's as cool and collected as a cucumber.  Perfect.  But when the Joker isn't trying to break down the morals of Harvey Dent or Lt. Gordon, he's fixated on \\"the Bat Man\\" and trying to break him down.  A sociopath cannot stomach morality in others.  And you know how he got the smiley scars, right?  You will if you see the movie.<br /><br />There's a lot going on in this movie, so don't come half asleep.  I'll be glad when it comes out on DVD so I can see all the special FX extras and watch the movie without smelling the awful breath of the kid sitting next to me.  He could've flipped that 18-wheeler all by himself just by breathing in its direction.ath of the kid sitting next to me.  He could've flipped that 18-wheeler all by himself just by breathing in its direction.

B00005JPTK|4.0|Based on the book by Richard Matheson, I Am Legend is the story of Robert Neville (Will Smith), sole survivor of a plague that, originally, was supposed to be a miracle cure for cancer three years before. Instead, most of the world died at the hands of the plague. Others mutated into bloodthirsty vampiric creatures; only a small percentage of humankind remained immune to the disease.<br /><br />All alone in New York, virologist Neville tries to find a cure and \\"fix\\" the problem that stole the lives of everyone he knew and everyone he loved, while also trying to survive in a city infested with the infected and ferocious monsters.<br /><br />Straight from the start you know you're in for a ride.<br /><br />An empty city, overgrown and broken down.<br /><br />A lone guy speeding through the streets in a fancy car, weapon at his side.<br /><br />Animals prowling the streets, free of their cages.<br /><br />The lock up.<br /><br />The screams.<br /><br />The howls.<br /><br />Yeah, good stuff.<br /><br />The intense feeling of atmosphere was what drew me into this flick. Immediately isolation sets in right from the first frame as we see Neville trying to maintain a normal life in a dead city (renting movies, talking to mannequins, keeping a routine), his eyes washed with pain yet underscored with determination to keep on going. This is a one-man show and I haven't seen it done so well since Cast Away (one of my favorite movies) years and years ago.<br /><br />No complaints about Will Smith here and he's done a good job over his career to make you forget about the loud-mouthed homeboy he played in Fresh Prince of Bel-Air. Plus, did you see the guy in this film? He's ripped! Shredded. But, I guess, you'd have to be if you lived a world where vampire-zombie-human things prowled the streets and your life could be in jeopardy at the drop of a hat if you weren't too careful.<br /><br />Which brings me to the monsters in question. Overall, well done. Creepy skin, no hair, loud growls, amazing agility and intensely vicious. Yeah, killer. Obviously they were CGI so they did look a tad rubbery and there were a few moments where it felt I was looking at a cartoon. Thankfully, those moments happened so fast and the action was so intense that I quickly forgot my quibble and moved on.<br /><br />My only thing was the ending. Now, I never read the book so I can't compare, but it ended too abruptly and really lost its post-apocalyptic feel in the last five minutes or so. Sort of a Disney ending, which didn't fit in with what was a gloomy story up until that point.<br /><br />Regardless, if someone asked me what I thought of this film, I'd tell them to go see it.<br /><br />It's that good.<br /><br />A.P.

B0019EXZY4|4.0|THE BANK JOB  is first class entertainment - a well-written script (Dick Clement and Ian La Frenais) with many twists and turns, face paced direction (Roger Donaldson), and a reliable cast of actors who know this genre well.  AND it is all based on a true event from 1970 when a bank heist in London resulted in a number of falls of the heads of government who were locking away their 'dirty underwear' in the safety deposit boxes of a quiet bank on Baker Street.  A great, unique movie this is not, but it is one that provides close to two hours of complex but highly suspenseful antics that keep the viewer glued to the screen.<br /><br />Terry Leather (Jason Statham) isn't making it as a car salesman and has debts to pay to the crime world. He meets an old sweetheart Martine Love (Saffron Burrows) who proposes that Terry and his friends rob a bank that is due for security repairs and a fairly surefire safe means to instant wealth.  Martine just happens to be working with a fellow who wants some rasty photographs of Princess Margaret in questionable sexual liaisons and has Martine setup the 'easy heist'.  Terry and friends agree to the too-good-to-be-true venture and begin to burrow into the bank vault under cover of night and clever means. Once the 'keystone cops' of London arrive on the scene the comedy portion begins, but when Terry, Martine and friends successfully achieve their goal, all manner of complications occur and the ways in which police and governmental corruption color the picture  makes for a solid ending.  As a fine addendum, the true facts of this actual heist and resulting events are flashed on the screen before the closing credits.<br /><br />The cast (including such fine actors as  Stephen Campbell Moore, Daniel Mays, Alki David, James Faulkner et al) seems to have a great time with the caper and there is just the right balance between suspense and comedy to make the movie work.  And oh the secrets about naughty England we discover!  Grady Harp, July 08

0743297334|4.0|THE SUN ALSO RISES becomes airborne only after Hemingway establishes two characters. These are: Romero, the matador, who brings both excellence and integrity to his work; and Robert Cohn, a romantic who is in love with the alcoholic Lady Brett. When the powerful aspirations of these characters emerge in TSAR, the shallowness, emptiness, and cruelty of other characters--Jake Barnes, Bill Gorton, and Mike Campbell--finally comes into focus. Thereafter, TSAR is fabulous.<br /><br />But before these values are established, Hemingway seems only to be telling a story about the superficial sociability of thirty-somethings in the 1920's. These characters drink too much and are incapable of love, sometimes due to their wounding experiences in World War I. Their lives are mostly alcoholic busyness and Hemingway captures their tedious gaiety to perfection. But without the foils of excellence and idealism, these characters and their behavior seem merely dull, boyish, and humorless. Further, they are relentlessly anti-Semitic, which this reader experienced as a brainless reaction to the unrewarding and trivial content of their days and nights. (If something is wrong, blame Robert Cohn.)<br /><br />Stylistically, TSAR is uneven. Frequently, Hemingway uses a technique of following observations in strict temporal sequence. This works wonderfully when, say, Jake is praying in church and his mind moves, without much control, from one subject to the next. But this technique works less well when Hemingway describes the countryside, which is often. His style is: I saw this. Then I saw that. Next came this. The effect is that the writing doesn't attain focus. Here's one of many examples, this one from Chapter 10:<br /><br />\\"We came down out of the mountains and through an oak forest, and there were white cattle grazing in the forest. Down below there were grassy plains and clear streams, and then we crossed a stream and went through a gloomy village, and started to climb again. We climbed up and up and crossed another high Col and turned along it, and the road ran down to the right, and we saw a whole new range of mountains....\\"<br /><br />See what I mean? This is just a list, with Hemingway not bothering to pull what Jake sees into a single memorable and evolving image. I know: The professors say this is deliberate, with the imaginative reader knowing how this terse prose fits together visually. But aren't skilled authors supposed to do this work for their readers?sed another high Col and turned along it, and the road ran down to the right, and we saw a whole new range of mountains....\\"    See what I mean?

B0017I1FP8|5.0|This is a great movie soundtrack. It did so much for the movie, and I like that fact that it carries some of the same melody lines as its predecessor, Batman Begins. Hans Zimmer and James Newton Howard created a new Batman theme with the first movie and it carries through to this one. I just love that dark sound. This score really does a lot for the movie. I am a firm believer that music helps to make a movie, and this is no exception.
B000X1Z0BU|4.0|The movie is mediocre, but the accomplishment astounding and the soundtrack so beautiful that it'll make your heart soar and your soul sing. This is truly an indie film and should be enjoyed only in the content of such (don't expect big-budget explosions or even good lighting from the two handheld cameras that this was shot with).
B000VWYNNW|5.0|The Mighty Zep's been around a long time, and if you're like me, even the best music can start to get stale from over-play on the radio. If I never hear the Single version of Stairway to heaven again it will be too soon. That being said - the live versions of old standards on this album are different enough to make them seem great all over again. I never tire of them - even Stairway - and the Whole Lotta Love version on this album is still one of my favorite tracks of all time.    If you're new to Zeppelin (my 15 year old niece loves them) or you've been a fan as long as I have - this album should be a part of your collection. The remastered version has a song or two not on the original.

0307237702|5.0|I first feel the need to note that many of the negative reviews of this book are from people that have not actually read the book and never had any intention of voting for Barack Obama.  Hence the reason for disliking the book and the ideology presented in the book.  In the early pages of the book, it is explained to be a vision more than a \\"cure all\\" or the answer to every problem which plagues America.  Not only is this an improvement on the status quo, but it amounts to change from the failed current status quo.      Many other reviewers, who have actually read the book, have done a fantastic job of recounting the highlights and facts presented in this book.  I will note that Obama's statements on compromise, value, and family were true highlights.  It is also often forgotten that Democrats are Christians too.    Reading this book, it saddens me to think of the direction in which the country is headed.  Accepting cheap soundbites from cable news networks as the whole story or chain emails as fact, I think we have lost a sense of what it means to be an American.  Conservatives may offer solutions, but have forgotten the art of compromise in the sake of progress.  Republican and Democrats are both capable of good ideas.  Politics is a divisive team sport, more so than ever.  For this reason, I can respect John McCain for his willingness to disagree with his party on occassion. I hope he continues to work this way in the senate for this forseeable future.     I believe Americans can have better.  Thomas Jefferson believed the government should be completely replaced every few years to avoid factionalism and the non-action that plagues the government.  I would like to see Obama begin the replacing.  While I may not agree with all of his ideas, I agree with him on more platforms than most.

While this treatment is much more accessible than the merely Brief version, it is disappointing by not exploring the more paradoxical and complex issues of quantum uncertainty and paired-particles.

B000PC6A3E|5.0|8 Years after the abortion of Batman & Robin, Christopher Nolan decided that he must bring back the dignity of Batman. In order to do that, he must forget anything even portrayed in the previous films. He must recreate the character and place him in a real world where everything isn't just cheesy puns and costumes with nipples. He did all that, and more with the help of some of one of the best movie actors today. Christian Bale, in my view can play almost any role but even I had my doubts about his ability to play the Batman. My worries were quashed when seeing the almost destroyed soul of Bruce Wayne portrayed brilliantly in the very first scene. My review will be separated into three sections, which I do for most movies that give me a lot to talk about. Those three sections are the story, the characters and the review.<br /><br />The Story: One day whilst playing with his friend Rachel, a young Bruce Wayne falls down a well disturbing a swarm of bats. The bats become the ultimate fear of Bruce's and eventually become his inspiration for wanting to strike the fear in others. While at the opera, Bruce asks his parents can they leave. After leaving through the back of the theatre, Bruce and his parents are encountered by a thief wielding a gun. His parents are shot which leaves Bruce angry, bitter and out for revenge. Through a series of events Bruce ends up in the Far East. He is approached by a man named Ducard (Neeson) who's employed by the ninja cult leader, Ra's Al Ghul. Ducard approaches Bruce with an offer to teach him how to fight and to overcome his fears. Bruce accepts the offer of Ducard. We are taken through the training sessions and given a further insight into the tortured soul that is Bruce Wayne. Bruce eventually finds his way home and endeavours to rid Gotham City of the criminal underworld. He must find a symbol which would help strike the same fear into the criminals that the bats did to him. The Bat becomes his symbol and with the help of Alfred (Caine) and  Lucius Fox (Freeman), Wayne starts to put together the first bat suit. There is corruption within the police force thanks to mob boss Carmine Falcone (Wilkinson). Falcone employs the help of psychologist Dr. Jonathan Crane (Murphy) who finds Falcone's men clinically insane in order to prevent them going to jail. Falcone can't trust Crane, however, as we find he's employed by someone else and is producing an inhalant toxin which strikes fear into those who inhale it. Crane, when spraying his enemies in the face with this toxin places on a mask and becomes one of Batmans biggest foes. The Scarecrow. Bruce Wayne must not only fight to find out what Cranes plans are, but he must also try to find out who he's working for before it's too late.<br /><br />The Characters:<br />Bruce Wayne: Played by Christian Bale, I think most Bale fans will agree that this is one of his best roles. He not only plays the tortured soul of Bruce Wayne brilliantly, but he also plays the Batman incredibly well.<br />Ducard: Played by Liam Neeson, I've never been a fan of Neeson's work but have to admit he surprised me. At 53 years of age the man is in great shape and if he didn't use a stuntman for most of the fight scenes, then I applaud him. The character is the one that creates Batman and it actually becomes quite ironic as Ducard turns on Wayne at the start.<br />Rachel: Played by Katie Holmes. I must be honest and say that the Rachel character altogether was instantly forgettable and I think the whole movie could have been just as great without her. I think they were aiming to create an unrequited love story, in which the movie goers would root for the characters to come together. It didn't work, and quite frankly was the only drag on this movie.<br />Dr. Jonathan Crane/Scarecrow: Played by Cillian Murphy. Murphy is someone else who's work I've never really been fond of but he really turned my opinions in his role as Crane. He gave a truly menacing facade and was someone who really made the hairs on your neck stand upright.<br />There are obviously a number of other characters that I could talk about but it would honestly give away the entire movie plot.<br /><br />The Review: Well. What can I say? This movie is incredible. I don't think I could put it any more plainly. Nolan set out to give us a Batman re-invention, some people were skeptical and some people were optimistic. I, simply loved the entire thing. The film kept its pace throughout, it told the story of Bruce Wayne in detail and made us understand the torment the man was going through. It also managed to give us new villains and give us the finale without any part of it feeling rushed or any sacrificing of relevant dialogue. It was truly a triumph for Nolan and was something that has now lead up to the record breaking The Dark Knight. Buy it, I promise you'll love it.eck stand upright.

B0018S6YOE|5.0|If you ask me, Rihanna is the best pop artist out there.  But this is probably her best album yet! With hits like Take a Bow, Shut up and Drive, Disturbia, Dont Stop the Music and Umbrella, this album is filled with amazing musical talent! All the different songs sound different, from the softness of Take a Bow to the rockin' out loudness of Shut up and Drive, these songs are catchy and fun, and very easy to learn all the words too.  Buy this album!
0812548094|1.0|Read this book, but then do yourself a favor and stop   and save yourself from a hard fall.  The ending, 'Confessor', most awful ending I ever read in my life!  And worse, bad writing!!!  And worse because many of his books in this series were so awesome.  I really loved most of his books.But...I just read finished the last book last night.I got it from the library. I'm thanking God I didn't buy it.When I got it from the library, I noticed the spine was all broken and torn. I was intending to fix it...but now I realize it must have been because the last reader threw it against the wall.  I was tempted to as well, but didn't.  It was as monotonous and amateurish. Where the heck was his editor??  I should have listened and not read the book and just made up my own ending.    The one thing I think I hated the most was the way he ended it the whole boring slog.... It was COMPLETELY obnoxious.    His theme in most of the books was to protesting religious zealotry. Those in the Order where following some misguided notion that they were killing in the name of the creator and lived under very communistic conditions.    As I read Confessor the preaching and reminding got so irritating I ended up simply skipping pages and pages of 'reminders'.    Through out the series there seemed to be an acknowledged basic natural(and good) desire to connect with the Creator and the spiritual connection in all of us. And that there was indeed an afterlife and he seemed to be pointing out that those killing in the name of the Creator are wrong.    Also, Goodkind spends many chapters explaining the 'theology' of his fantasy world....how magic works and is connected with the underworld etc etc..But then he completely trashes it AND connects his fantasy world to our real world!!! The whole effect was disconcerting and took away from the 'fairy tale ending'...because you know in this ending the Creator is dead, or consigned to some corner and told not to bother anyone ever again.    In the endRichard destroys the entire afterlife for those banished to the non magic world, where he conveniently alludes to those formally of the Order are now the 'building churches'!!! What?)  Not mosques, not temples, not circles...but CHURCHES! (and not just any Churches, but CATHOLIC churches because they use medals and 'talismans'. What?)    Excuse me? Is Terry Goodkind really this ignorant, or is he just another patsy for the secular order that is encroaching with the culture of death? I think both.    Does anyone want a link to pictures of happy young jihadists brandishing the hands of Christians and other kaffirs they collected for allah???? Those of the Order where more like militant islam and the Saracens of history and militant communism and nazi's rolled up in one!! Knowing that as of this minute while I write this thousands of Christians are being executed for 'blasphemy' and oppressed with well documented sharia dhimmi laws in muslim countries or as in communist China's case, having children ripped from their wombs because they value life and would want to welcome a new child among them,...but it's against the godless of laws of china. Or what about the mass graves of Orthodox and catholic priests and nuns from Communist Russia and it's former satellites??    What an insult to those really truly have and are suffering on behalf of the values of life and liberty.     Ugh. I was completely irritated that I even read the series to begin with. I will not bother to watch the TV series.    My advice is save yourself aggravation and money and skip this series.  It's a garden path to nowhere even if slavish anti-catholicism and Nietzschism doesn't bother you, the ending is so horrifically badly written, disjointing and boring after so many really good books, you come out of it feeling like you were slapped...hard.    M~
B000Q8QHK8|5.0|Above great picture and sound there comes a great booklike packaging featuring a booklet on the left and the disc on the right hand side. Beyond the proper restauration of this mediacritic masterpiece it's also dubbed in German 5.1, French 5.1, Italian 5.1 and Japanese 2.0 with region unlocked...so importing is an A1 option :o)
0316143472|5.0|I can't get enough of David Sedaris. His writing is incredibly funny, witty, and thoughtful. His stories make the reader reflect on his/her own life, but in a way in that makes it possible for him/her to laugh about it. I honestly could not stop laughing aloud!
B00003CXCD|5.0|Princess Ann (Audrey Hepburn) is tired of the royal life. She is required to behave in such a silly way and she has no time to enjoy herself. She visits city after city without any real change of scenery and she's tired of it. No one in her employ will help her achieve any excitement, so she takes matters into her own hands and escapes. Reporter Joe Bradley (Gregory Peck) finds her, and recognizes her for who she really is. What a story! He takes her home and plans his story, but can't let her know that he knows. The two spend a perfect day together on the town experiencing life as neither have done before.<br /><br />This movie is brilliantly executed. The cast is perfect and William Wyler's stylish direction puts Roman Holiday a cut above ordinary romantic comedies. The story is innocent enough for children to relish, but it rings true for adults too. Every new endeavor is a little adventure, so this film is exciting again and again even with repeated viewing.
B00005JPY0|1.0|Everyone was getting up throughout this movie -- no one seemed to care except when Ledger was on screen, and I've got to agree.  The movie, IMHO, stunk. Everyone around me was yawning like mad, as was I.<br /><br />Where is Tim Burton when we need him? The director of this film must have been on vacation during shooting. The charater development was dull and flat - as was most of the acting.  There was no one to care about. And for special effects is there anyting we haven't seen a million times already?<br /><br />This film in one word -- Bore - Bore - Boring.
0307265730|5.0|I used to think the mid-point between optimism and pessimism was realism--before reading the ineffable work of Jhumpa Lahiri in this collection of short stories. There exists no term for what she achieves in these delicately sliced portions of intersecting lives. It is not that no one accomplishes all that seems possible for them, not that no one is as ultimately afflicted as they could be, although these two outcomes hold true in every tale. It is that her characters and their situations (which include the other characters) seem to evolve to a precise center between the worst that could have happened to them and the best.<br /><br />There are other apparent mid-points attained by Lahiri. Characters are actors and acted upon just about the same. They do good and ill, what's loyal and what betrays, the honorable and the faithless in equal measure. They alternately evoke our sympathy and dismay, satisfaction and frustration, solidarity and disdain. Call it \\"lahirism.\\"<br /><br />You'll find nothing extraordinary here, no excess of courage or cowardice, no belly laughs or eyes cried out, no fierce wind or fiery sunlight. You will find life, of course, from conception to death--sometimes planned, sometimes accidental, at moments unwelcome, at moments embraced.<br /><br />The stories float on pitch perfect prose, with descriptions invading the plotline like  soft apologies, strangely placed and always well-timed. She does not open her stories in the beginning; she opens them organically, like a flower, throughout the telling, so that her last words are as much a beginning as her first. No sentence is meant to be screamed or whispered. Revelations do not descend upon you; you grow toward them.<br /><br />And that is the final genius of lahirism. Your growth toward revelation continues long after the story ends, as you ponder the choices made and the incursions endured. Jhumpa Lahiri's delicate flowers continue unfolding just as her characters' lives are presumed to continue unfolding, and that is when you realize that her seeming reach for the quintessential mid-point is an illusion. There is nothing symmetrical about life. Or death. It is one constant, aching, implacable surprise.<br /><br />This burgeoning treasure of an author is someone to shout about, even though her luminous prose would never think of raising its voice.ou realize that her seeming reach for the quintessential mid-point is an illusion.

B0000040EO|5.0|I watch this and enjoy it more now watching the interaction between Stewart and Grant.  THe dialogue is brilliant - some lines rival Shakespeare, Hepburn is at her best, the jokes are fast and furious like \\"Hellzapoppin,\\" the supporting cast is superb, as are the clothes and decorating.  Some gems \\"There are rules\\" - Stewart the gentleman, Hepburn's interaction with Stewart and his girlfriend, How tender everyone is with each other, the Quaker librarian, the scandal with the father and how they handle it.. the double meanings to almost every phrase.  You get more each time you watch it - clearly the actors relished working with each other. This is humor at its driest.

B0011KQSZ4|5.0|Frank Oz has created a great movie here, it's rare for a farce to work this well in a movie; they usually play better as sit-coms like Fawlty Towers. The key to it is the pacing, the characters, the gags, and the whole situation grows sillier and more widespread as the laughs unfold. By the end I was laughing hysterically - Loved it!

1400063515|4.0|Nassim Taleb's Black Swan makes for a fascinating read, despite (or perhaps because of) his heavily self-important style of writing. Taleb strikes at the core of the human tendency to prophesize, or more humbly, forecast all kinds of things. The reason why almost everyone gets it so wrong all the time, even while making predictions about seemingly mundane things (e.g.,  a project plan for building construction), is that they ignore the impact of \\"black swans\\", seemingly rare events. Taleb's contention is that while specific black swans are difficult to predict, the occurrence of some black swan or the other is very widespread in all walks of human life. In mathematical terms, Taleb contends that a lot of real life phenomena that are modeled using Normal or Gaussian distributions, are in fact governed by a Power Law distribution.<br /><br />Taleb introduces the notions of Mediocristan and Extremistan, the former including all areas of measurement where the outlier event does not make much of a difference to the average (e.g., the average weight of any population sample will not be skewed by the fattest or the thinnest person), and the latter includes all areas where the outlier (or the black swan) typically dominates the sample (e.g., Bill Gates' wealth would dominate any sample of the wealth of1000s of people of which he was one). Taleb points out that Extremistan is more widespread and commonplace than we'd imagine, and that we commonly end up making the mistake of applying Mediocristan tendencies of averaging, linear extrapolation and Gaussian distributions to situations that belong to Extremistan.<br /><br />Taleb argues that humans have a natural tendency to forecast, even though most previous forecasts have been proven wrong. In addition to ignoring the black swan, some of the reasons for incorrect forecasting include:<br />o Confusing cause and effect, or attaching unreasonable probabilities to events, due to \\"narrative fallacy\\": We have a tendency to believe statements of the form \\"U.S. Treasuries rise; Hussein Capture may not curb terrorism\\", which treats one event as a cause for the other. Similarly, people are likely to consider the scenario \\"A massive flood somewhere in America in which more than a thousand people die\\" as being less likely than the more narrative scenario \\"An earthquake in California, causing massive flooding, in which more than a thousand people die\\", even though the first scenario is more inclusive than the second.<br />o Ignoring \\"silent evidence\\" and drawing incorrect cause-effect relationships: Taleb quotes Cicero's story about Diagoras who, when shown the portraits of worshippers who prayed and then survived a shipwreck (the implicit suggestion being that the praying helped prevent their drowning), remarked \\"where are the portraits of those who prayed, and then drowned?\\". We often infer cause and effect relationships from incomplete data, because the only data we see has \\"the winner's bias\\". By ignoring silent evidence, we give an undue importance to the role of certain actions towards causing an outcome, instead of ascribing the outcome to luck or randomness.<br />o Confusing the uncertainty that averages out with the uncertainty in real life: We often confuse the unpredictable uncertainties we deal with (e.g., how long will the Iraq War last) to the more well-behaved uncertainties we find in the rolling of dice and casino games.<br /><br />Even if we opened our eyes to these mistakes, Taleb argues that we can not predict most real life phenomena. Modeling real life events using the Gaussian distribution is incorrect, because the assumptions behind the Gaussian (that all changes happen in a series of small steps, and that the odds are balanced at each step) do not hold in real life.<br /><br />So what's one to do in the face of these difficulties in forecasting? Taleb offers his prescriptions: First, do not try to predict a specific black swan, and instead just expect some black swan to happen; and second, take actions that expose yourself aggressively to black swans (i.e., expose yourself to wild upsides and downsides) but at the same time protect your downside using some form of insurance. For example if you are investor, invest 15% of your portfolio in wildly unpredictable assets, and invest the remaining in safe insured assets.<br /><br />Overall, I found Taleb's book a great read for anyone who uses data in decision making. It exposes a lot of mistakes I have seen myself and people around me make. I would strongly recommend this book to anyone, and I feel that reading The Black Swan will help any reader improve their understanding (or at least expose our lack of understanding) of the workings of the world around us.yourself aggressively to black swans (i.e., expose yourself to wild upsides and downsides) but at the same time protect your downside using some form of insurance.

0385340567|2.0|Fans write reviews when they are let down by their authors or are thrilled they have discovered a new one. Lee Child's Jack Reacher novels have been a staple of my fiction reading library since he appeared. However, with Nothing to Lose, I feel he mailed it in for the first time. There was only so much to do with the idea, and the repeated traveling between towns was worn out after the first couple times. The bad guys, such as they were,were lightweight and generated no fear. All in all, a novel that did not do anything for me and was a waste of money and energy in the anticipation. I went back and reread the previous books the last few weeks and confirmed this new one was a very weak and seemingly half-hearted attempt to repeat those. I hope he recovers his abilities for the next one.
B0013FNC38|5.0|I had no idea who this singer/artist was.  I saw his album cover in Starbucks (and it's sorta eyecatching with the drawing and the title) and said, \\"Hm.

So I said okay, gotta buy it. I did.  Now I can't stop listening to it.  And do I love Colbie Calliat? YES! Does he happen to have a duet with her on this CD? YES!  Do I like every song? NOOO.  3 or 4 of them I can't stand.  But the good far outweighs the \\"bad\\".  And it's not bad, just not my style of music.  But overall, a delightful CD.  There is this one song, I often fantasize he wrote just for me, is \\"A Beautiful Mess\\".  That song touches me in every way.  The profound words, the melody, the delicate nature. What a gift Jason is.  Again, not every song is my style, but the majority? Outstanding.  (In case you're curious, my favs in the order of \\"favorite-ness\\" are: tracks 5, 2, 12, 6, 3, 11, 4).  I highly recommend buying this interesting and fun CD!  And listen to the songs more than once before making judgements.  Let them play all the way through.  The nuances you find time after time is quite remarkable!
0316143472|4.0|David Sedaris is back with more witty and entertaining stories of his life, his family and his thoughts on the world.  He continues to make astute observations of the world and its quirks and writes about them in a way that keeps the pages turning.  Stories of his childhood and adult life as well as tales of his family never cease to amuse.  His writing style is brilliant and he is a true talent.  Unfortunately, his storytelling has aged like a good wine and has softened around the edges.  In some ways this is good because it makes for a solid whole, but it is not laugh out loud funny like some of his earlier works - specifically Me Talk Pretty One Day.  I smiled a lot and chuckled a few times, but gone are the days of aching bellies and tears streaming down the face so heavily that you can't read.  The writing has taken on a darker and more mellow edge over the years.  However,  I continue to be a fan and always hold out hope that one of these stories will bring me to laughter and tears.
B00005JPY0|5.0|The Dark Knight is the most realistic thus far of any movie based on a comic book.  Not surprisingly, this realistic portrayal (along with good writing and acting, of course) has produced an amazing film--for both casual movie-goers and fans of the Batman character alike.  This is no surprise because, unlike what many movie producers erroneously think, people who go watch a movie based on a comic book aren't doing so hoping to see a bunch of unrealistic people running around in strange costumes, saying weird lines, and doing cartoony things, such as in Batman and Robin.  People want to see comic books adapted to film because they want to see what these comic book pages would look like when put into the real world.  So, to make cartoony live-action adaptations defeats the purpose of putting them into a live-action world in the first place.<br /><br />Christopher Nolan, however, has got it right in his direction of the movie.  And the reason why this Batman film feels realistic isn't because of the visuals or the effects.  After all, when comparing Schumacher's Batman and Robin to the 90s animated series of Batman, it is the animated series that is more realistic, even though it exists in a 2-D world.  What Nolan has done to instill this film with realism is to give just about every action a consequence.  This movie is, after all, about consequences--the consequence of Batman's existence in Gotham.<br /><br />A year removed from the first Batman film in the series, Gotham has been cleaned up.  A new district attorney, Harvey Dent, has arrived and has won the love of Bruce Wayne's love interest, Rachel Dawes--a consequence of Dawe's not being able to live with Bruce Wayne's crime-fighting ways.<br /><br />Batman's existence also produces copycat vigilantes who respond to the bat signal, and they try to help fight crime, but without the proper training, equipment, or philosophy that makes Batman who he is.<br /><br />But, the biggest consequence the existence of Batman has produced is the escalation (hinted at the end of the first film) in the type of criminals that terrorize the city.  And in this installment, that escalation is the Joker.<br /><br />The plot involves the Joker's trying to unmask the Batman, holding Gotham hostage until Batman reveals his true identity.  A lot of subplots are involved, including one that requires Batman to go to Hong Kong to bring back a business mogul.  This scene does little for the plot of the film, except it shows that Batman is not limited by jurisdiction.  He can do what cops and judges, who must obey laws and rules, cannot.  Batman can bend the rules in his crusade.<br /><br />But bending the rules is not breaking them.  And the Joker is all about breaking rules, and he challenges Batman to win his war on crime without breaking his own rules.<br /><br />Like in Batman Begins, the plot is convoluted and almost unimportant, really, since it's not the plot that brings out the catharsis.  Christopher Nolan is much more interested in posing questions about a character as extreme as Batman is, and he uses character and plot as a combined vehicle to pose these questions.  He poses questions about the nature of good and evil (which Bruce Wayne admits to learning about in the beginning of Batman Begins).  A scene where people are trying to kill one person to save a hospital focuses this question.  Is it bad to kill someone in order to save potentially thousands?  Some of the questions may seem self-serious, but then again, without them, the character development of Batman would be flat, just like the Burton and Schumacher attempts that always relied on villains to carry their campy movies.<br /><br />This is not to say that the Joker in this movie isn't a fascinating character to watch.  Heath Ledger has created one of the scariest villains put on film.  You don't know where he'll show up.  You don't know when he'll kill or how he'll kill.  He may not be the Joker of the comics in the physical sense (his grin is merely make-up and not acid-bath-induced), but he is the Joker of the comics in the psychopathic sense.  Still, he is physically no match for Batman and his suits and gadgets.  So he challenges Batman by creating dilemmas.  It is not the villain that carries the movie.  It is the problems, questions, and dilemmas that they pose.<br /><br />In trying to solve these dilemmas, Batman, the cops, and the people of Gotham reveal to us the film's emphasis of consequences.  These consequences are felt by the audience in the sense of mood throughout the movie.  If anything is missing from this film, it is downtime.  There is no time to relax, to think about what has just happened.  It's one terror to the next.  The sense of fear in this movie works so well because it surprises people who expect comic book movies and action movies to not care about consequences.  Many action movies have a hero save one character at the peril of hundreds of others without blinking an eye.  We can see this even with Burton's Batman, where Batman goes around killing everyone without questioning the nature of good or evil.  You kill that person because he's a bad guy (you know, he gets up in the morning and proclaims himself a villain, so he goes out and does villainous deeds).  No questions asked.<br /><br />But lately, movies such as Spider-Man and Iron Man began showing consequences, and The Dark Knight puts it out there on the table for all to see.  The police march on the city, the attempt to save a guy who was trying to out Bruce Wayne as Batman, the question posed by characters in the movie, \\"How many people had to die?\\" and the revelation spoken by the Joker--that police officers and military men die, and no one really worries because it's expected.  Bad guys die, and no one cares, because it's all part of the plan.  You watch those action movies, and the hero saves that one person, but hundreds die--yet no one cares about those strangers, the bystanders, because it's all part of the plan.  But if you kill someone--like the mayor--suddenly, everything is in chaos.<br /><br />Nowhere else have these questions really been posed in a movie of this genre, even though the so-called superhero genre, by its nature, deals with the idea of good and evil constantly.  The closest we have ever gotten was the teen angst of a wimpy Spider-Man, and his questions are delivered on a dish of self-exploration whininess uttered by a nerd with little sense of identity.  Here, the questions are put forth not through adolescent deliberations, but through consequences shown by all players involved.  In a sense, it's the least heavy-handed of the movies to pose such self-serious questions.  But it is by far the scariest.is the Joker of the comics in the psychopathic sense.

The police march on the city, the attempt to save a guy who was trying to out Bruce Wayne as Batman, the question posed by characters in the movie, \\"How many people had to die?\\" and the revelation spoken by the Joker--that police officers and military men die, and no one really worries because it's expected.  Bad guys die, and no one cares, because it's all part of the plan.  You watch those action movies, and the hero saves that one person, but hundreds die--yet no one cares about those strangers, the bystanders, because it's all part of the plan.  But if you kill someone--like the mayor--suddenly, everythingis in chaos.    Nowhere else have these questions really been posed in a movie of this genre, even though the so-called superhero genre, by its nature, deals with the idea of good and evil constantly.  The closest we have ever gotten was the teen angst of a wimpy Spider-Man, and his questions are delivered on a dish of self-exploration whininess uttered by a nerd with little sense of identity.  Here, the questions are put forth not through adolescent deliberations, but through consequences shown by all players involved.  In a sense, it's the least heavy-handed of the movies to pose such self-serious questions.  But it is by far the scariest.

B0019FOC5E|5.0|The soundtrack to Momma Mia is very good. Meryl Streep and Amanda Seyfried have amazing voices. While Peirce Brosnan's voice is not as good he gives it is all (especially in S.O.S) and certainly did not need to be called a water buffalo (someone on a Sunday morning show called him that) Colin Firths voice is not as good, but the soundtrack is very good and the songs are very catchy staying implanted in your mind long after you hear them
B000002TQB|5.0|It seems I have some explaining to do right from the get go: for all those who claim that Blur's Parklife is the beginning of Brit Pop, there are just as many--maybe more--who would place this \\"movement\\" if not squarely at the release of Suede's first album, or even Oasis' \\"Definitely Maybe\\", then surely the its inception is more vague, consisting of a slow build, and based upon several releases and a general change in attitude.  One thing for certain, there is at least some good reason to believe that Brit Pop is somewhat reactionary, as an antidote to the imported grunge rock coming from the states, and the general \\"Americana\\" that had suddenly eclipsed what was by all accounts a major British music movement that never seemed to reach stateside with the intensity it had in England, that being Madchester, representative of bands like Stone Roses, Happy Mondays, The Farm, Flowered Up, and the New Fast Automatic Daffodils, among others. Even the first Blur album, \\"Leisure\\", was to some degree associated with the Manchester sound.<br /><br />But truth be told, the naissance of Brit Pop belongs to all of the above. As with any \\"movement\\" there are all sorts of reasons converging and catalysts a plenty.  Nevertheless, I hold steadfast in my assertion: Parklife is the Beginning of Brit Pop.  But why?  Why not other bands, or even previous releases by Blur?  Surely Modern Life is Rubbish should be considered!  It is, after all, quintessentially English if not more than a little anti-American.  But if Brit Pop is to be remembered as more than a one dimensional idea qua philosophy replete with an attitude, style, and general mode of being its crystallization must be found in once source, and that source is Parklife.<br /><br />Unlike previous Blur albums and certainly the other great albums by Brit Pop's elite, Parklife mixes its metaphors and is an interpretive history of all that is and has been noteworthy within popular British history: Mod, Punk, Northern soul (subtly its there), James Bond cool, Pub dirge, a show tunes a la Noel Coward.  And with guest appearance from Phil Daniels of \\"Quadrophenia\\" fame, as well as Lætitia Sadier from Stereo Lab (never mind she's French) it marked itself as a timeless as well as timely remark on why it was much cooler to turn on to a style that was ostensibly slick as opposed to turn off and be disenfranchised and angry, or maybe indifferent, which was what, essentially, American music was offering--or at least it seemed that way at the time.  Whereas the Seattle scene was donning flannel and ratty jeans, Brit Pop was about wearing trainers, football jerseys, and haircuts.  It sounds superficial now, but if you were listening to The Smiths, The Bunnymen, etc. in the eighties, then the Manchester and Shoegaze bands of the late eighties/early nineties, American grunge was disappointing.<br /><br />But all this is not to trivialize Blur or Brit Pop. It was, and is, certainly not just a style without substance.  To the contrary, its substance and content are rooted in its context, and Parklife is the seminal expression of the convergence of all of this.  In short, Parklife discloses the mood and feel, dare I say optimism, of the early to mid-nineties.<br /><br />Listen to it with an old copy of the NME, Melody Maker, or a Select, and you will know what I'm talking about!Bond cool, Pub dirge, a show tunes a la Noel Coward.

B000AYEL6U|5.0|Where has this been hiding?  I have had possession of this video for about 3 weeks now and have watched it about 10 times!!!  I can't stop watching!!!  The story is wonderful and the cast is extraordinary.  A must see for anyone who likes stories set in Great Britain.
B0012QE4Q2|1.0|This movie was absolutely horrible.  It was also a very big letdown after waiting for it to come out and then watch. Where was Wolsey in this?  He played such an integral part in the lives of Henry VIII and Anne.  I think they mentioned his name once. The movie was choppy and did not flow at all.  It seemed as if the script was the result of the good idea fairy gone bad. Too much cognac at a cigar bar is not what makes good script. If you want a much better movie see Anne of a Thousand Days with Richard Burton and Genevive Bujold.
0786948523|5.0|D&D continues to refine, define and improve the icon of all role playing games. 4th edition proves to be the best rendition of the game yet.  It offers smoother combat mechanics, easy to \\"learn and play\\" rules and best of all a revamped and, gratefully, improved Magic system! And for classes, there are no more \\"to be avoided\\" classes as they are all good to play and balanced.  Monsters in the series are easier to plan and run with the new streamlined system and its dependance on minitures to operate combat. And the Dungeons Master Guide, once relagated to the \\"other stuff\\" book, now actually tells you how to narrate the system and tips on how to be a better Dungeon Master!  The only drawback to this otherwise superior system, is that it seems to have removed most of the background roleplaying aspects that rounded out a character, such as the Craft, Perform and even Ride skiils that were present in previous editions. But, given the overall improvement of the system, it's well worth the investment!
B000RPTQ1C|5.0|I don't know if this band is trying to make a political statement, however I love George Bush and respect everything he has done for the United States.  He is an American hero regardless of what the liberal hippies think.  Great CD though!!!!
0811729117|4.0|Otto Carius tells of his days as a Panzer Commander.  He starts his military career driving the Czeck made Pz 38 with a 37mm gun and bad armor and ends his days driving the excellent Tiger tanks.  I knew the Tigers were a good tank that needed to be constantly fixed by their crews.  However, Otto basically says the ex-Czeck tanks are junk with weak armor and this cost him some savage wounds early in the war.    Otto is both a great writer but delivers a little disjounted story.  That should have knocked it down to 3.5 stars (C+ grade) but the machine does not allow it.  Example, we go from Otto being an enlisted man on the Pz 38 and \\"poof\\" he is an officer.  We don't learn a thing about his OBC or anything like that.  Now, Germans tended to view their training as secondary to the action.  It's like a pro-football player talking about training camp versus the big game.  However, training is how a military prepares for a fight and it's always nice to know how the German army did this.    Otto gives day to day living while fighting against the Soviets.  First, they lose quite a few soldiers due to slipping and then being crushed by the tracks.  Second, the Germans designed the best tank hatch for the commanders in the Panzer III.  The first Tiger hatches were too high and made a good target for Soviet PAKs.  Otto is quite happy when the Tigers are all retrofitted with improved hatches.    Now, Otto also tells a reader something this reviewer has long suspected; he was not a great tank hunter by design.  He was just out in the field so much that he just saw a lot of Soviet tanks.  Now, Otto killed more than 130 tanks in his career.  But when you break it down to 1941 to 1945 it's not a tank a week.  Otto is quite clear about the fact that if you want to get tanks then you must be in the field.  Indeed, his company commander is quite upset that he never gets a tank but Otto's platoon and personal tank constantly get kills.  It's like deer hunting; if you don't spend timein the field you're not going to see a deer.    Otto was one of the personal reasons why the Soviets didn't break the seige of Leningrad for nearly 30 months.  Any time there was an attack you could pretty much count on Otto and either a platoon or company of Tigers to break the back of a Soviet attack.      Strangely, Otto knocks out his share of the excellent Stalin tanks, one of the best tanks of WWII.  His gunner always knew the weak spot on the Soviet tanks.      Now, after the war Otto spends time in a Soviet prison.  That tale is both brutal and fast.      I liked this story.  Otto gives background on the German WWII tanks.  In the back of the book you get to see the many awards this excellent soldier received in WWII.  Boy, I wish we had soldiers like him on our side.    3.5 stars and a darn fun read.
B0013J9KOO|3.0|Interesting mix of comments on this one.  I saw it last night and can't quite make up my mind about it. At the time it was thoroughly enjoyable, with all the amazing visuals and the slyly humorous characterizations. I'd certainly recommend anyone to see it, whether or not you're a comics person (I'm not) or have seen the first Hellboy (which I did, and loved it). This one opens with a very minimal recap of Hellboy's origins, just enough to set the scene without duplicating the much lengthier exposition in the first movie.     I do think there is some central weakness somewhere and it stems from ambiguity in the plot line. The nonhuman Prince finds humanity a locust-like scourge upon the planet, destroying its beauty and mystery and all its ancient mysterious races that humans no longer see, and this is a view that may strike an uneasy chord with many of us. Hellboy sides with the humans, though if I remember correctly the Prince at one point suggests that he should really be with the \\"Others,\\" and he has a point! Then too, the legless cart-pulling Northern Irish faun/pixie/jester/oracle tells us that somewhere in the far future Hellboy will be responsible for a huge disaster to the human race: does Liz still want to save his life? Of course in best Hollywood style she says \\"yes\\" but we have to wonder if she was right.    Couple of random thoughts:    Someone commented that the Troll Market scene would \\"rival\\" the Cantina scene in Star Wars. Well, all tribute is due to the founder of the \\"fantastic alien crowds\\" genre, but Del Toro has definitely outdone him! Though it's true he doesn't make enough of the multiple fantastics he has created - everything is a bit rushed. Maybe it suits him better to work with just a few bizarre creatures, as he did in \\"Pan's Labyrinth\\" and give them each more attention and screen time.  The appalling \\"tooth fairies\\" (and they are not what you think!) work very well, for instance.     What is it with Del Toro and Scotland? Hellboy is originally found off the Scottish coast, and the really obnoxious amoeba-like alien appears as \\"an old Scottish witch.\\"  I guess he likes Macbeth.     Someone said the musical score was \\"banal\\" - tin ear! Tons of Vivaldi, and the Mozart clarinet concerto, other good stuff.    Summary? You should certainly see it, if only for some neat lines. (She, pretentiously: \\"My body is a temple.\\" He, snappily: \\"No, it's an amusement park.\\")

B00004BZ0N|5.0|The song \\"London Calling\\" touched a nerve at the start of the 1980s. Like the Young Ones, 2000AD, and the impact of new wave was being felt. The haze of the seventies was gone. A new dawn of nihilism was upon us (attack commercial greed - Koka Kola) people were scared and we were taught in schools of nuclear holocausts (London Calling) but the beauty and naivety still remains in songs such as \\"Train in Vain\\". As strong as The Stones Exile on Main St (the great double album of several years earlier) but preaching to an audience who would rather die than associate themselves with such a 60s / 70s iconic group. This was the music of our generation and we embraced it will both arms. Nothing would be the same again, and The Clash had moved New Wave to the next step, a kind of wary respectability.
1604590483|5.0|This is the most important book I have ever read!  After watching \\"The Secret\\" I wanted to learn how to put the LOA (Laws of Attraction) into action.      I originally purchased \\"The Power of Positive Thinking\\" but could not get through it due to the excessive preaching that God is the only answer to happiness.  I returned to the book store and discovered \\"The Power of Your Subconscious Mind.\\"  It was EXACTLY what I wanted.  While Dr. Murphy is a deeply religious man, he does an excellent job without preaching!      I have recommended this book to just about everyone I know and a lot I don't that could use its teachings.        In addition to purchasing this book, I also recommend learning about EFT (Emotional Freedom Technique).  You can find examples of it on YouTube.
0439023483|5.0|Our school librarian was able to secure a pre-publication/advance reader's copy of this book and after she read it, she shared it with me, a second-grade teacher.  (I won't be reading this to my second graders!) I had just finished reading \\"The Shadow Children\\" series by Mararet Haddix(\\"Among the Hidden\\", \\"Among the Imposters\\", \\"Among the Betrayed\\", \\"Among the Barons\\") and the trilogy by Lois Lowry (\\"The Giver\\",\\"Gathering Blue\\", \\"Messenger\\") and our librarian knew I liked those types of books.  I took \\"The Hunger Games\\" with me on vacation and read it in no time at all.  The action is quick-paced, and there were never any dull moments for me in this book.  \\"The Hunger Games\\" is geared toward junior high/middle school children (age 12 and up) who enjoy reading about futuristic societies, such as those in Margaret Haddix's \\"Shadow Children\\" series, or in Lois Lowry's trilogy.<br /><br />The main character is a 16-year old girl named Katniss, who tells her story in the first person.  In the ruins of a place once know as North America, is a shining Capitol surrounded by 12 districts.  The Capitol forces each district to send one girl and one boy \\"tribute\\" between the ages of 12-18 to participate in the annual Hunger Games--a fight to the death on live TV. When her younger sister's name is called, Katniss volunteers to take her place.  The back cover of the book sums it up like this:  \\"But, if she is to win, she will have to start making choices that weight survival against humanity and life against love.\\"  The last page of the book says, \\"End of Book One\\", which lets me know there will be a sequel...and I can't wait to read it, too!<br /><br />If you know a young reader who enjoyed Lois Lowry's trilogy, or the \\"Shadow Children\\" series by Margaret Haddix, steer them toward this book.
1881273989|5.0|I learned about \\"The Five Love Languages\\" from a former coworker who found it incredibly helpful in his marriage.  Not being married myself, I purchased this version for singles.    I have recommed this book (or the original) to just about everyone I know and a many I don't!    The concepts are so simple but yet profound.  Understanding the primary love languages of my friends, family and even coworkers has been very helpful and has strengthened our relationships.      The only negative feedback I would give is in regards to the Physical Touch chapter... it isn't until then that you truly realize this is a Christian book!  I deeply respect Mr. Chapman but think he should know that people have pre-marital sex and it is not a sin!  Aside from that, this (or the original) is a MUST READ!!!
0689878451|5.0|A wonderful book that's a true story of two male penguins who were allowed to raise an egg on their own. A great way to introduce 'other' types of families to children.  For open-minded adults who want to encourage open-mindedness and understanding in their children.  I would recommend this book to any parent who has the foresight to introduce the topic of 'non-traditional' families to their children before other kids with less understanding parents provide them with biased and untrue opinions.
B000EGF0B4|2.0|I suppose IF they werent living a cowboys existance ( and that's all they knew ) , they could have gone to a big city where nobody really cared ..however, in the early 60's many still did  care, and shunned the gays even before AIDS , many were stayed in the closet ( so to speak ).    I 'm guessing the reason they married women was to throw off any suspicion from them in their small towns , especially when they were caught romping about  in camp while suposedly watching over sheep .     ( Now there would have been a good subsitute if lonely on the range I hear . )  anyway, The one wife knew early on ...why did she stay ?  I wouldn't have . I'd be out that door in a flash .    The movie to me  was slow and I had to watch it three different times , pick up where I left off to get thru it . Glad I waited til cable got hold of it .    Seriously I'm still not clear how the one guy died . did he actually have a tire blow up in his face OR did some cowboy who'm he misjudged as gay got pissed at this & he &  his friends murder him ?   Hey, I understand there still is limited tolerance in many of these \\" cowpoke \\"  communities .   It's been in  news papers that not many years ago a gay boy was murdered then dragged beyond  recognition behind  their  truck . We're still learning tolerance in this country I guess .

Viva la Vida inspired me to go out and buy almost every single one of their CD's. Chris Martin's smooth voice and the Bands catchy beats will win you over trust me. This album is so relaxing i love it. you will not be disappointed. and hey if you like bands like Pink Floyd and REM then you should DEFINATLY buy Viva la Vida. Its really good
B00127RAJY|5.0|I workout regularly and when I started this workout I didn't think I would really sweat.  I was wrong!  Jillian created a great workout that can be done in 20 minutes and I like that.  In level 1 you start off doing jumping jacks.  I do not enjoy working on the abs so I like that you only have to do 1 minute of ab work during each circuit.  Jillian does a great job of keeping you working and the workout goes by fast.

B00003CXA2|5.0|One of the greatest touching movies ever.  Forrest Gump is a movie that will make you cry, and it will make you laugh.  When I first saw it in 2001, It touched my heart.  I watched the first few minutes of it, and I couldn't stop.  I watched it downstairs and stayed their all night to watch it.  And it was spectacular.  Tom Hanks is perfect as Forrest Gump.  Won 6 Oscars for Best Actor (Tom Hanks), Best Director (Robert Zemekis), Best Visual Effects, Best Film Editing, Best Picture, and Best Screenplay.  Went to this touching story about a simple man named Forrest Gump who, even though isn't very bright, accidently ends up getting involved with some of the biggest key moments of the 19th century.  It's funny, touching, heart warming, and sad.  I read the book, and the first line even touched me.  I highly recommend watching this.  It deserves a chance.  I've seen it 14 times in counting too!  Get it, buy it, see it, and you'll see what makes this a 100% succesful movie.

0312330537|1.0|In many ways Roberts is an amazing writer. He draws compelling characters, creates a wonderful sense of space, and uses language colorfully. However, Shantaram, ultimately goes nowhere and is unsatisfying. It is a book about an addict. A man who is addicted to heroin, to crime, to ideas and to his inflated sense of self importance.<br />Shantaram is a novel the same way \\"A Million Little Pieces\\" is. It's autobiographical with poetic license.<br />A heroin addict, turned criminal, busts out of a maximum security jail in Australia, and with a forged passport, winds up in Bombay. He assumes the name Lin, given to him by the first guide he meets, and has many of the personal adventures described on the book jacket. In between the adventures, Lin preaches often cryptically sounding ideas, which are more glib than pithy -- there is no art without forgiveness, fanaticism is the opposite of love, etc. etc.<br />Ultimately, for all his musings, Lin learns nothing. He simply transfers one addiction for another. He was constantly betrayed by men in the Indian mafia, and you are led to believe that maybe he'll break away, but, no. After fighting in one war to aid a man who betrayed him in every way, he will ultimately fight in another for the same man, because he owed his life (which would never have been at risk in the first place, had he not gone to war for his Don, Khader) to a henchman.<br />When appalled at people's distaste for his descriptions of his compatriots as honorable men, Lin will glibly say that there's a difference between honor and virtue. Men who are arsonists, forgers (helping wanted men to travel), smugglers, who sacrifice their friends to put police off their trails are neither honorable, nor virtuous. They are thugs,who will turn on you, if need be. They turned on Lin and left him in prison, knowing they could have gotten him out, and knowing that he was supposed to be beaten to death. Yet the fact that he survived made him tougher and more valuable.<br />Roberts should find a more interesting subject than himself to write about. He certainly has the skill to do so. I hope he has the interest.a more interesting subject than himself to write about. He certainly has the skill to do so. I hope he has the interest.
B000YABIQ6|5.0|Mad Men is one of those very rare TV shows that is both superb and popular.  Sometimes there really is a TV god.  Unlike great shows like Friday Night Lights, people are watching and the awards are rolling in - 16 Emmy nominations, more than any other drama this year.<br /><br />It's 1960 in a Manhattan based advertising agency.  The men have slicked back hair, crisp white shirts and perfect suits.  What comes out of their mouths would get them slapped or sued if it happened today.  Toots, babe, honey.  Women are sex objects and they have less brain power - as one character says, \\"It was like watching a dog play the piano\\" when a certain female character with professional drive and passion exceeds the lowly expectations of the men.<br /><br />The women are no better.  The head secretary tells another female that they (the men) designed the technology so simple that even a woman can use it.  A mother smokes and drinks while pregnant and ignores the danger of a nearby child playing make believe with a plastic drying cleaning bag over her head.  Some of the women act childish because that's the role that's been forced upon them.  Others are starting to reject the social strait jacket and are rebelling - it's the beginning of a new era and they are the foremothers of what is about to hit this nation like a baseball bat to the head.<br /><br />The wall paper in one house is plaid and the cars are big and many have tail fins.  There's a cigarette in almost every scene - people cough and there's no recognition of any connection in their minds.  One major character smokes, drinks and eats with abandon and almost dies of a heart attack with, again, no recognition of cause and effect.<br /><br />This show, unlike any on air or cable at this time, immerses you in its era.  It's authentic, real and grabs your attention.  Quite simply, if you watch only one current show on TV this year it should be Mad Men.<br /><br />Several reviewers have commented on the packaging.  While itis a little more delicate than others, it's still cool (it's like a cigarette lighter) and you can handle the DVDs without damaging them.  The DVDs are held in the case with a foam insert that doesn't scratch the surface.  When you take the DVDs out you have to gently push against the top side with your (clean) fingers and gently push upward.  They will come out and you won't smudge or scratch the surface.  If the DVDs are getting damaged it's because people are just grabbing both sides of the disc and pulling it out.  Unlike other reviewers, I have not been impressed with other boxed sets where you end up literally breaking the plastic sprockets that hold the DVDs in place.  If you want really poor packaging just look at the complete West Wing.  In any case, you can handle these DVDs and not damage them.<br /><br />The extras here are sparse but very good nonetheless.  There's an hour long behind the scenes docu that looks as all aspects of the show from character backgrounds to hair and art design to the actors feelings about their characters.  It's not full of that fluffy hype stuff you find on other DVD sets where they just show you short clips from the show and present it as somehow something new.  You'll actually learn something about the show.  I would love to see full interviews with all the actors to talk about the characters they're playing.  Maybe we'll get that in the season 2 set.  As noted by others, the commentaries are minimal and a bit disappointing.  Doesn't really matter in the end as it's still a superb show you simply shouldn't miss.
0440238609|5.0|I just finished this trilogy. Amazing accomplishment by Philip Pullman.  To describe these as children's books does not to them justice, as they are written at a very sophisticated level. His prose is delectable, the story moves at a fast and never lagging pace. Yes there are children as protagonists, but I am an adult with no children and read these eagerly for myself alone.  HIs scope is staggering and the overall story inventive and original.  I've read the Harry Potter series and this trilogy is FAR SUPERIOR in my opinion, mainly because the writing is so much better and more complicated (though not to detract from JK Rowling).  I really had no idea where the story would end so my attention was held to the last page.  This series of books is really of the highest order of fiction and deserves a place among the great adventure fiction that has been written to date.
B0018OAPAW|5.0|This is the best album from the Offspring in a long time. It's right up there with Smash or Ignition as an album I can listen to the whole way through without feeling the urge to skip a track or two. This album was well worth the wait, and after all these years, they still haven't lost it. Rise and Fall, Rage and Grace is a much more solid offering than Splinter.    The album is pretty short, in typical Offspring style, but the fact that listening to it twice is better than listening to most longer albums once, that's hardly a turnoff. If you were ever a fan, this is a must have, and if you haven't listened to the Offspring before, this album is a good place to start.
B000HEVZ6W|5.0|Great Movie, Wanted to see this again, so I thought I should buy on Blu-ray. Great picture quality, and love the movie. very different from most movies out there. Interesting take on the future of humanity.
B0010X8NF0|3.0|A tender remake of the Beatle's movie, \\"Help\\", starring The Three Stooges, partly filmed on \\"Groundhog Day\\".     There are two messages in this film. The first: Americans--crass, obnoxious, self-absorbed, and unsettingly off the beat of any other society--are surprisingly loveable and oddly helpful. The second, in the words exchanged between two parties in the film who could not reconcile:   \\"Yes, the past happened. But it's over, isn't it?\\"  \\"Not for us.\\"
B00005MCX2|5.0|Someone else used the term \\"protopunk\\" and I think that might be a good way to describe this outwardly trippy, sci-fi themed band of many legends (and parodies). WARNING LONG JAMS, which is why they are often lumped with other progessive rock bands of the period. Swoopy cool dated analog synth with lots of reverb, great driving beats and songs wringing lots of stuff out of a very few chords, some effects and a wahwah pedal. It really makes sense when Lemmy's next band defined Speed Metal. Great musicianship throughout. Sometimes a band's live album becomes their defining moment - Little Feat's Waiting for Columbus, Be Bop Deluxe's \\"Live in the Air Age\\", and for myself, that is the case here. It is dated to be sure, but this still a great artifact of a band, and as good as anything they have ever done.
B00009NHC5|4.0|As the title indicates, my mother-in-law highly recommended this movie, so my wife and I gave it a try.  It's a mystery with one unpredictable turn after another.  Starring Audrey Hepburn as the sweet, blind but intelligent and crafty Suzie Hendrix; Richard Crenna as the reluctant con artist/thief; and Alan Arkin as the sinister master of disguise Harry Roate.    The progression of the film reminds me of my favorite Alfred Hitchcock film ROPE (starring Jimmy Stewart).  The climactic plot twist reminded me most of M. Night Shyamalan's first three popular films (back when he made good movies).  The acting is pretty good, but not what I would call Oscar-worthy (with sincere apologies to Audrey Hepburn fans).  But you forget about all that when you get caught up, and eventually, totally lost in the characters and the inevitable problematic scenarios in which they find themselves.    We heartily enjoyed it and would watch it again.
B000094HMU|2.0|Where's Cecil Beaton when you need him. When you have the greatest singers of the last half of the 20th century, Nilsson and Corelli, you don't need all this excess! The Met has toned this production down shortly after this broadcast. This production is so busy I hardly even noticed the singing. You'll find every thing you need on the stage but a basket ball court.
B0011UF792|5.0|Love this Film from start to finish. I am of course a HUGE Kevin Smith fan. But this give a very good and unique look at religion and faith. A very good funny comedy. BTW the Blu-ray disk looks great. And sound is awesome as well.
B00005JPY0|5.0|Rarely has a film left me speechless, much less a comic book inspired film. Christopher Nolan's rendition of the DC comic character has. \\"THE DARK KNIGHT\\" may well be the best comic book film I have ever seen. Christopher Nolan, along with Jonathan Nolan has crafted a screenplay of nearly unbelievable proportions. The duo has taken the \\"Batman\\" mythos and has turned it into their own; what results is a film that captures the essence of the comic book and combines it to a truly gripping and engaging psychological crime drama-action-adventure. You heard that right, a psychological crime drama and an adventure.<br /><br />I'll get right to the point, you don't need to read any reviews, (including this one) just watch this film. It stomps Burton's rendition of the caped crusader to the ground and MAY well eat \\"Batman Begins\\" for breakfast, lunch and dinner; all the more evolving the concept of Gotham City's \\"Dark Knight\\".<br /><br />Still here, no trust? Ok then, here we go...<br /><br />Gotham City is the battle ground. The mysterious \\"Batman\\" has the crime element by its ear. Harvey Dent (Aaron Eckhart) is an incorruptible force in court and Lt. James Gordon (Gary Oldman) has his special unit to combat crime. Seems like a good time to be in Gotham, doesn't it? Wrong.<br />A mysterious \\"Joker\\" (Heath Ledger) has surfaced and seemed poised to take Gotham's soul by creating mass hysteria and chaos. Gotham's population is at the mercy of this madman--and what does he want? To prove a point.<br /><br />Christopher Nolan has impressed me before, with his films; \\"The Prestige\\" and \\"Memento\\". But never as much this time around. The director has abandoned the idea that \\"Batman\\" has to have a comic book feel. The film goes for the comic book's soul. Nolan is armed with a near flawless script that exudes the spirit of Gotham City as well as its Dark Angel. If there are any holes in it then I cannot see it. The movie is unstoppable, the direction it went is awe-inspiring that it nearly gave me goose bumps. The movie not only portrays the usual Batman vs. Joker main event, it also defines the meaning of the word \\"hero\\" as well as the morality that surrounds the idea.<br /><br />\\"The Dark Knight\\" has a lot of characters and the film develops each one. No one is a plot device, everyone has a purpose in the screenplay. Heath Ledger gives the performance of his career (Rest in Peace, Heath) and trumps Nicholson's portrayal. Ledger's \\"Joker\\" is very reminiscent of the Joker in the comic book \\"The Killing Joke\\". The maniac is not after money, he has no grand scheme but he wants to prove a point. This Joker isn't joking around, this villain is frighteningly twisted, maniacal and homicidal. Ledger performs as if he saw the adage: \\"Crazy people don't know they're crazy\\" and brings all to bear. There's no \\"origin\\" as to where he came from, although his past is suggested by his quippy remarks. The Joker will remain an enigma in this film, and I think it's a very smart move to do so. Christian Bale is still a great Bruce Wayne and as his cowled alter-go. Bale changes his voice to a raspy one when he is Batman.  Aaron Eckhart is an intriguing Harvey Dent, the district attorney is charismatic, heroic and the embodiment of Gotham's hope, until he--well, has a very bad day. Yes, Two-Face makes an appearance and not to worry, the character won't be one-dimensional.<br /><br />The film's success is that the plot has attained a life of its own. The characters can breathe and everything has a purpose. The film's main premise is not limited to our two nemeses. Even Gotham City itself has become a character in the movie as well as its inhabitants. Gotham is portrayed as a melting pot of chaos and disorder and one nudge towards the wrong direction may unbalance the city's moral fiber. Yes, the film has its bit of morality in it and explores the decency of everyday folk. Before, in \\"Batman Begins\\" James Gordon and Bruce's lost love Rachel (played this time by Maggie Gyllenhaal) embodied this idea, but the concept is more widely expressed this time around. The Joker's target is the soul of Gotham and never more has the stakes been this high. The Mantle of the Bat is by itself a separate entity from Bruce and the concept is even given more depth, just what it means and what it is.<br /><br />The movie still has the tank-like Batmobile and a newer version of a Bat-cycle or in this case, a \\"Bat-Pod\\". The mantle of the Bat has undergone some updates to make it lighter but for me, it looked bulkier. Tim Burton's rendition of the Bat-suit may have the edge over this one but none are more accurate than the Bat suit in the fan film: `Batman Dead End\\". If the film had a fault, is that the fight sequences need some smoothening up. They're not bad, it's just that it's not as hard-hitting as I would've liked and the camera work needs to hang back a little bit so the audience can see the fight a little more. The action sequences itself are exciting, the movie does have some very cool car chases which are intense and adrenaline-pumping; further complemented by Hans Zimmer's very powerful soundtrack. The proceedings have that somber but intimidating \\"dark\\" feel that the film's cinematographer needs to be commended. The visuals are great, the CGI doesn't look they're CGI  at all.<br /><br />There are cleverly placed bits of humor that help the film's pace. Alfred (Michael Caine) supplies the sarcasm that is reminiscent of his character. The sarcastic exchanges between him and Wayne give a lot of depth to their relationship. Morgan Freeman reprises his role as Lucius Fox and his character has a humorous exchange in sarcasm with a Wayne Enterprises employee. Fox also serves a significant role as a man who serves as Bruce's conscience almost as much as Alfred. Even \\"The Joker\\" adds some twisted bits of black humor--\\"I have a magic trick..\\", boy, what a way to add an exclamation point to his character. The bits of humor help the film balance its darkness towards its gripping build-up to its end game.<br /><br />BATMAN is a dark character and he is arguably the most interesting character in DC's line of comic books. The man is an enigma and very mysterious. Obsessed? Crazy? a Genius? This man is an urban legend and Nolan and company has successfully represented all these factors. Ledger's performance may have taken the spotlight since this is his last film and he does somewhat steal the show from Bale--from Bale not the character itself.<br /><br />I'm not exactly sure how Christopher Nolan will be able to top this film. The promise of things to come and its climax has such an impact the way everything was structured through its storytelling. Comic book fans have a reason to rejoice, the director has taken the Batman myth to new heights. \\"The Dark Knight\\" is epic, deliciously exciting, unforgettable, groundbreaking, scary and manages to put the audience in the middle of the struggle between Gotham's Dark Knight and his arch-nemesis; The Joker. The film is very sincere and precise in its execution.<br /><br />HIGHEST POSSIBLE RECOMMENDATION!

B000E1ZBGS|2.0|Really disappointing in comparison to the A&E production. Read the book and you'll realize the difference. A&E was faithful to the book and to the time period; an excellent series. This might appeal to some but is nowhere near the quality interpretation of the A&E/Colin Firth series.
0066620996|3.0|I bought the book after seeing him on PBS. I must say I am a little diappointed. I was really hoping for some deep insight and inspiration. Instead I read about a bunch of research from newspaper clippings by some research students.<br /><br />Collins has some great concepts Level 5 Leaders and the \\"Stockdale Principle\\" and then some things to turn on the eclectic filter as you read.<br /><br />Find or steal one of Tom Peters books on Excellence - Before you read this
B0017I1FNK|5.0|I love this CD. If you love EmmyLou's music like I do you will love this CD also.
B00006G8G1|5.0|While I have never been the hugest Maiden fan (like listening to them, but never I guess totally appreciated them), this is making me more of a Maiden fan.  They rock on this.  I'm already feeling like I'm back in H.S.  LOL  This is a good performance from the boys, and the second disc isn't too bad either.  Put this on and rock out!
0671015206|4.0|This book is one of the most highly read and rated personal finance books and aptly so. The data-driven research reveals who the real millionaires in America are and its not the flashy, sports car driving individuals you might think. Its a very insightful look ino the lives, habits and finances of America's wealthy, covering a wide range of topics from purchasing watches and cars to economic outpatient care and self-employed business owners.     Although the amount of data presented can become dry and redundant at times as other reviewers have stated (my main reason for 4 instead of 5 stars), the information is there for those who want to take a deeper dive into the numbers behind the summarized observations.     Overall, this book presents some great personal finance lessons and is highly recommended, along with the simple lessons to be learned in \\"The Richest Man in Babylon\\"
B0018CWEYY|4.0|While I was not such a great fan of the series in the beginning, Lost has shown itself to develop into very solid TV viewing here. While the constant flashbacks are not allways that interesting and are unenecessary, because it is still what is happening on the island that is the most interesting, they only disturb at times. The storyline is tsrong and we get to see what happens to Jack as he is with the Others. Of cuorse the whole thing does end up in an unexpected cliffhanger episode towrds the end but I guess that is necessary. Probably of the more surreal moments in the episodes would not even be necessary since the overall quality is rather high. Also at the moment you can get the whole series quite cheaply.
B0019FOC5E|5.0|I first heard Meryl sing in an operetta at Vassar my freshman year during Christmas House Parties weekend. She was playing cards with three other classmates, and they were all wearing period costumes, including sky-high white wigs. In watching \\"Mamma Mia!\\", it looks like the Fountain of Youth gushing up from the cracked patio, worked. It was like no time had passed. Didn't she look great? So, I wasn't surprised when Brosnan got down on one knee--who wouldn't? And she can still do the splits from her high school cheerleading days!  It was the only film of hers in which I cried--during the mother/daughter scene when the daughter asked Meryl to give her away.  I couldn't believe I was crying during a comedic musical!  If Meryl reads this, she should know that at the end of the film when she asked the audience if they wanted more, all the guys in the movie theater, shouted,  \\"Yeah!\\" at the screen.  Go, girl!
B000EUDAWG|1.0|My Son received this as a gift and it was true love until we actually removed it from the packaging. It was broken out of the box. After exchanging it for another. It worked for approximately 15 minutes. So fragile doesn't even cover it. Its beyond cheap if a careful 6 year old with adult supervision can break it simply by pressing the remote buttons. It'll be going back for a refund.
B001AGXEAG|4.0|Just wanted to post a correction to what the previous review said...<br /><br />The film is NOT based on the cartoon it's the other way around. The cartoon came later.
B0014BECF8|5.0|George Michael is one of my all time favorite musicians.  I love the combination of the various stages of his career. I also gave one as a gift to my son, who loved it of course.
B0016HNOXQ|5.0|Eleven years is a long time between releases. It's been awhile since their albums were in heavy rotation on my playlist, but this sounds just as good if not better than anything they've out out. I can't understand people waiting eleven years and then being disappointed that the new album is not exactly like the last one. Things change, I guess a lot of people don't, or are in denial. Anyway, you would recognize this as a Portishead album immediately on hearing, and it's new, different, and good.
B000002J1S|5.0|No wonder Gabriel left Genesis after this - how could he have followed TLLDOB? I know there are many people who love the Phil Collins version of Genesis and I do enjoy most of the albums they produced but Gabriel's Genesis was one of the most innovative and adventurous bands Britain ever produced. Trespass was an interesting album, Nursery Cryme, Foxtrot and Selling England By The Pound were exceptional albums, full of inventiveness and melody and whilst TLLDOB may not approach the beauty of SEBTP, as a concept album; as a work of art, it is unsurpassed. It has to be taken as a whole and only then can it truly be appreciated. It takes the listener on an 'adventure' some years before Scott Adams took us on a Dungeon Adventure; the album is nothing more than the first  'adventure'. It may only take place in Rael's mind yet all of us who once found ourselves in a \\"maze of twisty little passages\\" will understand that Gabriel took us there first of all and left us confused, breathless yet fulfilled in the process. I do not wish to belittle the contribution of Banks, Hackett, Rutherford and Collins but this is Gabriels's masterpiece and I have loved it more than any other album for 34 years
B000Y7U98C|4.0|Among the reviews posted here, I see several complaints about unfavorable comparisons to \\"Event Horizon\\" and sci-fi disaster movies.  While there are certainly some plot elements in common with \\"Event Horizon\\" and the general category of space disaster films, \\"Sunshine\\" belongs more to the genre of \\"2001: A Space Odyssey\\" than anything else.  It's smart, character-driven science fiction - not a festival of explosions for their own sake, and I think it succeeds very, very well.    \\"Sunshine\\" has an excellent, if lesser-known-in-the-U.S. cast.  (Although it's likely that viewers will recognize many of actors' faces, if not their names.)  It's great to see Hiroyuki Sanada, Michelle Yeoh and Cliff Curtis all getting meatier roles than they usually receive and making the most out of the opportunity.  Cillian Murphy and Rose Byrne are both quite good as well, but to me, the real surprise was Chris Evans (of \\"Fantastic Four\\" fame), who, it seems, can actually act with some depth.    Visually, the movie is beautiful, and director Danny Boyle makes the sun a palpable presence in every scene.  The indescribable power of our star and its effects on the human characters are major elements of the story, and it creates an atmosphere that is simultaneously beautiful, terrible and oppressive.  The ending is a little more Hollywood than the rest of the movie, and \\"Sunshine\\" deserves a better finish.  That said, the drop-off is only enough to change my review from five stars to four, and I recommend it highly.      Fans of movies like \\"2001,\\" \\"Outland,\\" \\"Silent Running,\\" \\"Alien\\" and the director's cut of \\"Blade Runner\\" (without the hand-you-the-plot-on-a-platter voice-over) are likely to enjoy \\"Sunshine.\\"  Viewers looking for purely passive entertainment and/or who prefer having everything explained explicitly will probably be less happy.  Grade: A-.
B0000683DH|5.0|Take a classic television series with a dedicated fanbase, insert one of its most popular villains and toss a major motion picture budget at it and what do you get:  \\"Star Trek II:  The Wrath of Khan.\\"<br /><br />Perhaps the closest film in the \\"Star Trek\\" catalogue to the original televison series, \\"Khan\\" finds Kirk as the admiral in charge of assessing a green crew on routine training maneuvers.  They happen to be aboard his old ship, the Enterprise, and the crew includes most of his key past crewmates.  In another part of the galaxy, former crewman Chekov and his new captain are investigating a planet that may be used for Project Genesis, a device that could literally give new life to a planet.  What Chekov and his captain actually find is a man hungry for revenge:  Khan.<br /><br />Having been exiled years ago and blaming Kirk for the death of his wife, Khan puts a plan into action to bring Kirk back into his clutches in order to get revenge.<br /><br />Falling for Khan's trickery and with an inexperienced crew in tow, Kirk takes the Enterprise to Regula One, home of Project Genesis.  He hopes to find out who used his name in order to get their hands on Genesis.  Instead, he finds an ex-wife, an estranged son and one of his greatest enemies waiting to strike.  What happens next is, simply put, a wonderful blend of drama, suspense and humor as Kirk and Khan battle each other to the death.<br /><br />For a film released in 1982, \\"Khan\\" has excellent special effects.  Granted, there are a few miscues, but the story more than makes up for them.  Director Nicholas Meyer paces the film with perfection, utilizing the musical score and the individual performances of the players in order to build tension on the screen.  He guides the games between Kirk and Khan with precision.  All of the original crew do superb jobs, but I must point out that William Shatner gives his best performance ever.  Ricardo Montalban's over-the-top performance as Khan makes this film worthy of five stars.  Kirstie Alley makes her first big screen appearance and adds quite a bit of sex appeal to the film as Lt. Saavik.  That's a tough job for a person playing an emotionless Vulcan to do.<br /><br />As for the DVD, this two disc set makes up in quality what it lacks in quantity.  The digital transfer of the film is excellent.  It's one of the best transfers of a film including the original cast.  Only \\"Star Trek VI:  The Undiscovered Country\\" has a crisper looking transfer.  The sound is also very good.  There aren't as many special features included with this set when compared to the other films in this series, but they are some of the best extras you'll find.  Highlights include original interviews with DeForest Kelley, Leonard Nimoy, Shatner and Montalban as well as new interviews with Shatner, Nimoy, Montalban, Meyer and executive producer Harve Bennett.  There's also an interesting segment involving \\"Star Trek\\" authors Julia Ecklar and Greg Cox.<br /><br />Fans of \\"Star Trek\\" have most likely viewed this film already.  For those folks who haven't or for people who aren't fans of science fiction, I highly recommend \\"Star Trek II:  The Wrath of Khan\\" for its drama, wonderful suspense and overall story.  For fans of military films, the calculated tactics of both Kirk and Khan should keep them interested.

B00005JPTK|5.0|The movie, I Am Legend starring Will Smith, is based somewhat loosely on Richard Matheson's 1954 novel of the same name.  Now, most people don't know who Richard Matheson is, but this is the writer who influenced both Stephen King and Dean Koontz where they were teenagers, not to mention thousands of other kids, myself included.  This was the man who wrote some of the most famous Twilight Zone episodes of the sixties, especially Nightmare at Thirty Thousand Feet.  This is the author of the famous horror novel, Hell House, which was also turned into a film.  Flipping the coin over, Matheson is author of the famous romance novel, Bid Time Return, and this was also turned into a major motion picture, though most people know it as Somewhere In Time.  There's also the novel and movie, What Dreams May Come.  Richard Matheson is therefore one of the greatest writers of the last half of the Twentieth Century.  Without him, we might not have had Stephen King and Dean Koontz writing such brilliant books.<br /><br />I Am Legend with Will Smith is the third adaptation of Matheson's novel, and Mr. Smith does a truly excellent job of portraying the lead character Robert Neville, capturing his aloneness and near insanity at being quite possibly the only human being alive.  Neville was the military doctor experimenting with new drugs and viruses in the hope of finding a cure for cancer.  What was discovered, however, wiped out most of the human population, while changing those still alive into flesh-eating zombies, or vampires, that move at a tremendous speed and seemed to be filled with an incurable amount of rage and violence.  Because the creatures can't survive in the sunlight, Neville has control of the day when he and his German Shepard go out hunting for food and raiding the nearby DVD store.  Neville is also still searching for a vaccine that will cure the symptoms of the virus.  He uses zombies that he's captured, and the testing usually results in their deaths.  The night, however, is totally controlled by the creatures, and Neville must always be home by dark in order to barricade himself inside his Washington Square apartment with its reinforced doors and window shutters.  In time a confrontation is inevitable between Neville and the creatures, and this in turn eventually escalates into a full-blown battle at between life and death at the end.<br /><br />I had mixed feeling about the movie when I first saw it at the theater.  When the Two-Disc Special Edition came out, I found myself enjoying the longer alternate version with a different ending.  I think the director, Francis Lawrence, and the Special Effects people did a fabulous job of creating New York City a few years down the road after the plague has done its nasty work, showing the desolate streets with non-moving cars and trash lining the curbs and weeds growing out of the pavement.  And, Will Smith, plays perfectly to this setting, creating a character that is near the end of his rope and talks to mannequins in the DVD store as a way of keeping himself from going crazy, then goes berserk when one of the mannequins shows up in a different location.  Unlike a lot of viewers, I loved the creatures.  The scene where Smith has to go into the basement of a bank to find his dog and runs into a group of them standing together in a group had me dropping popcorn all over my lap.  I felt myself in the darkness with him as well as the strong fear that he was experiencing.  This is definitely one of the best horror scenes done in the last few years.<br /><br />I believe the Two-Disc Special Edition with a longer version of the film and an alternate ending is the way to go.  I do have to say that other than a different version of the movie, there isn't much else offered that I cared about.  The makers of the DVD set could've done a feature on the long history of I Am Legend with an in-depth interview from Richard Matheson and a more detailed look at the making of the film.  That will probably come in a later edition somewhere down the road.  Anyway, this is a good, fun movie with some superb acting by Will Smith.r edition somewhere down the road.

B0019FOC5E|3.0|Had the soundtrack before I saw the movie, and just saw the movie tonight, and off the top of my head, songs that are missing from the soundtrack are: Chiquitita, \\"I Do, I Do, I Do, I Do, I Do, I Do\\" (although it plays a very minor role in the film) and Waterloo (sung during the encore performance). Of course, I'd still rather listen to the original flawless Abba recordings than this version, but it does more truly bring back memories of the movie.

B00164DWEA|3.0|I'm one of the few people who really liked Ang Lee's version of the Hulk, so keep that in mind when I say this revamped version was, meh, OK. Where Lang's film had its heart and basis in the comic books, the new version staring Edward Norton has its heart in the 1970s TV series.     The film has some major \\"slow\\" spots, But the 3 or four main action sequences that are in the film are wll done. And there's a truly wonderful sequence where Edward Norton (non-Hulk mode) does his best Matt Damon impression and has a Jason Bourne-esque chase sequence through the slums of Brazil.     Norton does a great job portraying Bruce Banner's desperation, but Jennifer Connely is sorely missed as Banner's paramour. Tim Roth does a decent job as the film's main villain, Abomination as well. Fans are also introduced to two other key Hulk comic book characters throughout the course of the film (I won't mention names here lest I spoil the surprise for Hulk fans).    However, I will say the film has a very intriguing end  shot of Edward Norton that shakes up a bit what the traditional Hulk mythos has been. Also there's a \\"bonus\\" scene a-la the Iron Man movie where Marvel Studios seems set to begin intertwining their film characters.
B0013D8LCW|4.0|wonderful movie about a guy who is torn between his family and his new found love. Brad Rowe, who plays his role very convincing, and Trevor  Wright are magnificient.
B000N6TYLW|1.0|Holy crap could this have been any worse? I mean seriously breaking up Logan and Rory on the second last episode, why? Never really getting Luke and Lorelai back together, ridiculous! Finally can we think of no better way then to send Rory away so that she basically won't see her mother for like a year? If it was up to me, Luke and Loralai would have gotten married and so would Logan and Rory and then Rory would have gotten the NY Times job, and that wouldn't be the best ending but at least it would have made the long time viewers happy, rather than show us this sub-par crap of an ending.
B0002XNSY0|5.0|I can only add my kudos to this cult timepiece. Title could have been \\"It's a mad, mad world\\"! Peter Sellers and George C Scott give masterful performances. No wonder that this film has a cult following all over the globe!
B00005JPY0|5.0|This movie certainly is drawing a lot of comparisons.     The Wall Street Journal compares it to No Country For Old Men, Rolling Stone magazine compares Bale's performance to Pacino in Godfather II and Ledger's performance to McDowell in Clockwork Orange, TIME magazine compares it to  Silence of the Lambs, a very astute comparison was made to the film HEAT by one reviewer at aicn.com [[...] and everyone else (the aforementioned included) compares it to Jack Nicholson's Joker in the 1989 Batman directed by Tim Burton.    However, if comparisons must be made, I think director Christopher Nolan's The Dark Knight would best be compared to Peter Jackson's Lord of the Rings trilogy.     Nolan, like Jackson, based his films on previous material and translated it to film in an engaging way that spoke to modern audiences while staying true to the source material. Tolkien's Middle Earth is an allegory much like Nolan's Gotham City is an allegory. The Gotham City of The Dark Knight bears much resemblance to a slightly more sinister post 9/11 America.     Gotham is a city ensconced in fear (thanks in no small part to the events of Batman Begins, which gets a brief nod in the film's opening sequence) and while a trio of do-gooders (Lieutenant Gordon, D.A. Harvey Dent, & Batman) are working tirelessly to put away Gotham's crime bosses and eliminate the fear...along comes the Joker to exploit that fear.    Much like Jackson's LotR films were not just simply \\"fantasy films,\\" Nolan's TDK cannot be accurately labeled as simply a \\"superhero\\" movie. TDK, like LotR, not only serves to re-invigorate a genre, but redefine it as well.     Nolan has made an Epic/Action/Drama with TDK--a film that not only excites and astounds, but questions and examines. Nolan, like Jackson, examines not only good and evil, but the grey areas in between the two and how sacrifice is key to holding society together.     Corruption, violence, terror--is modern American so accustomed to these things that it cannot withstand a full on assault of its founding democratic principles of truth, justice, and liberty?     Or is society already lost? Have we all grown so accustomed to the violence and corruption of democracy that we ourselves have been corrupted to the point that we're all just dancing around each other, merely hiding our savage nature under a thin veneer of normalcy (or \\"the plan\\" as the Joker calls it)? The Joker believes the later and feels compelled to point out this veneer to the citizens of Gotham.    Nolan would like to think we're not so close to the corrupted savages the Joker would make us out to be. Thus Batman. If Joker represents amoral savagery then Batman is conscience. Batman makes the choice that so many Americans have had to make in the face of an assault on our freedoms. Batman sticks to his principles (or \\"rules\\" as their referred to in the film) despite the fact his life would be so much easier/happier if he didn't stick to those principles. That's sacrifice.    This need to sacrifice is underscored in a moving scene at the end of the film where a large group of Gotham's citizens is basically put in a maniacally malevolent experiment by the Joker where they must become mass murderers or die themselves. Joker is ultimately left disappointed in his experiment, but not without a cost to some of the film's characters--not without a sacrifice.    Despite its many excellent action scenes The Dark Knight isn't one of those blockbuster movies where audiences leave the theaters feeling exhilarated an \\"pumped up.\\" Instead you're more likely to feel drained as you walk out the door. The Dark Knight doesn't simply take you on an emotional ride, but on an ethical and ultimately introspective ride as well.
B0017HEYEI|1.0|I got totally baboozled.. its all in Korean.. oh yes, you can hear it in English if you can read the Korean characters to know which to choose for English.    The picture I saw did not show the Korean on the front.    I am very angry I got taken... I have never had a bad experience before with Amazon.
B00005JPY0|5.0|I normally don't give out such very high grades for movies but Dark Knight really is that good. Though it probably won't happen Bale, Ledger, and director Nolan should all get nominated for best actor and director respectively. This movie is definitely multiple OSCAR worthy.    I have been a big fan of comic book hero/movie adaptations my whole life and I thought Spider Man II set the bar and still is an incredible movie but Dark Knight may have surpassed Spidey II.    The chemistry between the actors and the way the script flows was simply amazing and the special effects were extremely well done without being a bit too absurd like they were in Revenge of the Sith and yes I loved that movie too.     In the end though this movie stands on its on. Heath Ledger's performance was just simply amazing. He brought a personality and bone chilling cold ruthlessness yet compelling take of a villain that made me hate him yet understand why Joker acts the way he does in order to get his way. Heath Ledger will be missed by me. This role alone will always make him remembered for generations to come.     Christian Bale as Batman is my Batman out of all the characters who have played him. He really shows the problems Batman has to confront both as billionaire Bruce Wayne and protecting Gotham at night as Batman. In this movie you really see him struggle with internal conflicts and he almost goes over the edge yet Bale gives Batman enough soul to keep him going and to carry on despite all the pain and suffering Batman endures.     I want to also give props to the supporting casts and say that I loved the actor's performance who played Harvey Dent. Aaron Eckhart was superb in this role as he will be a great villain for the next movie. Morgan Freeman, Michael Cain, and Gary Oldman all bring their roles to life as Lucius Fox, Alfred, and Commissioner Gordan. I did however miss Katie Holmes take on Rachael Dawes but her portrayal by the beautiful Maggie Gyllenhaal was marvelous still.Finally Christopher Nolan has raised the bar for directing as at first I thought nobody would come close to Tim Burton's classic take of the first Batman. Nolan has done that and in my mind rescued Batman from certain death at the movie theater. He brings out all the emotions one can from the dark streets of a crime filled Gotham night to the inner struggle the characters face every day just like ordinary people face. I simply can't say enough about the quality this man has brought to Batman movies and out of everybody he is most deserving of any and all awards associated with this movie.    Go see it, its worth the hype it received and even people who hate these types of movies will like them. Dark Knight drained me and touched me in a way few movies do and in my mind is easily one of the best movies ever made.
0446677450|1.0|I read this book several years back, and frankly remember very little of it.  In a nutshell, the real lesson of the book is that the poor buy necessities (food, clothing, etc.) the middle class buy liabilities (cars, boats, etc.) while the rich buy assets (stocks, bonds, real estate).
B0016OOM7Q|5.0|A new wonderful album from the queen of Pop!  Madonna may be a 49-year-old working mom pushing 50, but she still loves her dance floor, her catsuits and her pop hooks. She's also an expert chameleon, co-opting current musical tastes for her own pleasure.     The album jumps off the disco of 2005's ''Confession on a Dancefloor'' with thunderous, up-tempo club grinds but also some surprisingly dark moments. The Neptunes - the production duo of Pharrell Williams and Chad Hugo - add retro-synth beats while Timbaland punches up the power R&B, along with Justin Timberlake and Nate (Danja) Hills. Madonna co-wrote and co-produced the album's 12 tracks, which swerve from the psychedelic-horn blitz of the Timbaland-produced hit ''4 Minutes'' to the swooping drama of ''Voices.''    We live in a Madonna world. And as long as she keeps releasing albums as vivid, relevant, distinctive and modern as this, we will for a some time yet.
B000RPSVE0|5.0|Beautifully sung and played.  Reminds one of the Berlin cafe music from the 1920s, which is probably where most of the composers found their niche.  Sad to know that these people didn't survive, but their music lives on!

B0002W4SWC|5.0|I just love this movie.  An absolutely wonderful, believable storyline.  Solid performances by Renee Zellwegger, Hugh Grant and Colin Firth.    Renee Zellwegger is quite endearing in this movie and I actually think it's one of her best performances.  She's charming, funny, and does a great job getting you to fall in love with Bridget.  I also think her accent was fabulous.    Loved Hugh Grant in this one as it's a little different than his usual nice guy persona....it really works and he really makes you laugh.  Even though he's the womanizer in this film, he still is quite likable as you see that he and Bridget genuninely seem to have fun together.  (despite his \\"wandering\\" ways.)      Colin Firth is a mostly hoyty and serious attorney who has trouble letting hair down (unlike Bridget), but you can really see him falling for Bridget throughout the movie.  I found him quite charming and surprisingly sexy as well.  You find yourself rooting for him over the likeable Daniel Cleaver character played by Hugh Grant.  Firth defines Mr. Darcy in every way and does not disappoint with this performance.    Liked this one so much, I had to own it.....Great movie, while somewhat of a \\"chick\\" type flick, I can see it appealing to a larger audience as it's got lots of humor, but not too slapstick.
B00001U0DP|4.0|After requesting the movie we thought that could take over 10 days, it only took 4 days. The movie is great, we really enjoyed.
B0017I1FNK|4.0|I am writing this review after my second listening of the CD.  This is the only EH disc that I own but I do enjoy country music.    -  Songs: easy listening; layed back (mellow); folk / ballad style.  Definitely a \\"listening\\" CD vs. background music.  Nothing to hum about but good if you're looking for something different, especially from her (according to the reviews).    -  Recording: instrumental tracks are excellent; on some songs the voice tracks sound \\"recorded\\" and artificial.  I have a fairly high-end system with good quality headphones that tend to exagerate recording flaws.    -  Packaging: cardboard sleeve for disc; my disc already has small scratches and some pitting but for $10 I can live with it.
B00005JPY0|5.0|\\"The Dark Knight\\" is brilliant! This is how the story goes: With the help of Lieutenant Jim Gordon and District Attorney Harvey Dent, Batman sets out to destroy organized crime in Gotham for good. The triumvirate proves to be effective, but they soon find themselves prey to a rising criminal mastermind known as the Joker, who thrusts Gotham into anarchy and forces the Dark Knight ever closer to crossing the fine line between hero and vigilante.    The cast led by Christian Bale (excellent as usual in his returning role as Bruce Wayne / Batman), Two-time Oscar winner Michael Caine (also returning as Alfred Pennyworth), Oscar-nominated Heath Ledger (brilliant in his final and career-best, Oscar-worthy performance as the Joker), Gary Oldman (returning also as Lt. James Gordon), Aaron Eckhart (in an interesting performance as Harvey Dent / Two-Face), Maggie Gyllenhaal (replacing Katie Holmes as Rachel Dawes), and Oscar winner Morgan Freeman (returning as Lucius Fox), and also returning in a brief role, Cillian Murphy (as Dr. Jonathan Crane / The Scarecrow) is excellent!    The directing by Christopher Nolan (who also directed \\"Memento\\" (2000, also wrote the screenplay with brother Jonathan and both were nominated for Oscars for Best Original Screenplay), \\"Insomnia\\" (2002), \\"The Prestige\\" (2006, also wrote the screenplay with brother Jonathan), and \\"Batman Begins\\" (2005, also wrote the screenplay with David S.

This is one of the best films of the year, if not, the best film of the year. This is also the best superhero / comic book movie ever. This is a brilliant, action-packed, and thrill-packed masterpiece that will keep you entertained. Heath Ledger is brilliant as The Joker and this is another brilliant character he fashioned, brilliantly, of course. This is just as brilliant, if not better than his performance as Ennis Del Mar in \\"Brokeback Mountain\\" (2005). This character is one of the best villains, if not, the best, in a movie, since Hannibal Lecter.
B00005JO20|1.0|Please..... This movie was absolutely dreadful.  The ridiculous scenes were enough for me.  Do not waste your time renting, buying or otherwise watching this terrible remake!
B0010X73ZG|1.0|Frank Darabont ruined this movie in the last 3 or 4 minutes.  I'm not going to give away much in terms of spoilers, but, basically, he had four ways to end this movie.  One, he could have used the original ending of the Stephen King short story, which probably would have been best.  Two, he could have gone for a totally nihlistic, \\"everybody dies\\" ending, which I would have prefered.  Three, he could have gone for a sappy, happy Hollywood ending, which would have been, at least, expected.  Finally, four, he could choose a wishy-washy ending, neither happy nor completely bad, that makes the main character look like a complete fool and idiot.  The fourth choice is, of course, what Darabont chose.  Don't give me a \\"but it's realistic\\" excuse.  If movies were meant to be realistic, they'd all be documentaries.    If you are a die-hard Stephen King fan or just bored, then, by all means, rent this film, but I won't ever watch it again.  I was enjoying this movie, since it is pretty faithful to my favorite Stephen King short story, until the ending made me feel that I completely wasted my time watching it.
B000000OAN|5.0|Looking back at the 1970s, sometimes many forget how big the band Queen was. Even as Queen moved into the 1980s, while their popularity did slightly decline in the United States, it continued to be very high in Europe. Their performance at Live Aid is widely considered one of the greatest of all-time and their subsequent \\"Magic\\" tour is considered one of the all-time greatest concert tours. If it weren't for Freddie Mercury's death in 1992, we might still be talking about Queen being as big a band as the Beatles. When Queen released their 1973 self-titled debut album, it showed all of the signs of greatness to come. This album would show how the band embraced a \\"theatrical\\" feel to their music as well as embrace a sound that would evolve into what would become Heavy Metal.  The next two albums, \\"Queen II\\" and \\"Sheer Heart Attack\\" continued down the road of the theatrical sound.   It was that third album, \\"Sheer Heart Attack\\" that would not just become a commercial  breakthrough album for Queen, but also become an album that would showcase Mercury's abilities as a Hall of Fame vocalist.   On \\"A Night at the Opera\\", while the band moves slightly away from the theatrical sound at times, they continue to progress with as a band.  We also see the other members take it up a notch from already a high level of musicianship.    Queen is an example of the sum of the parts actually being greater than the whole. However, if you take each of the four members of Queen, they easily stand on their own as a top musician in their profession. Freddie Mercury is easily known to be the emotional and flamboyant lead vocalist of Queen who indeed has a legendary voice. Brian May is the legendary lead guitarist and probably the second most popular member of the band. Roger Taylor and John Deacon go extremely underrated. Listen to Taylor's thundering drumming in the studio or live and one can easily understand why he was asked to participate in an All Star Drum Jam (The S.O.S. All-Stars) atthe Live Earth concert. As for John Deacon, he might be one of music's all-time underrated bass players. Many of his bass lines have proven to be the foundation for Queen's musical sound. In addition to being top musicians, all four members play integral roles in the songwriting.      Here is a track by track synopsis of this collection:     \\"Death on Two Legs (Dedicated To...)\\": This track was written as a \\"hate letter\\" to Norman Sheffield, Queen's former manager.  The opening lines of the track really back this up with lines such as \\"You suck my blood like a leach....you've taken all my money - and you still want more\\".   There is definitely anger that comes out in this song - thus giving it a feeling of true emotion.    \\"Lazing on a Sunday Afternoon\\": This is the first of three \\"vaudeville/ragtime\\" feeling song.  The song is highlighted by a combination of Mercury's piano and a wrap-up guitar solo by May.    \\"I'm in Love with My Car\\":  Queen fans know Taylor is more than just a drummer and this song shows it.  Once again, Taylor proves he is a top-rate lead vocalist.  Taylor's higher octaves almost give this song what I would consider an early heavy metal feel to it.    \\"You're My Best Friend\\":  Deacon is often the forgotten member of Queen, but this song proves he is as talented as anything - writing this track as well as playing electric piano and bass.  Freddie Mercury's vocals give this song a three dimensional feel in terms of emotion (Deacon wrote this song as a tribute to his wife).  Quiet as always, Deacon's bass also proves to be a foundation for this song - also synchronizing well with Taylor's percussion.     \\"'39\\": This might be one of the most underrated tracks in Queen's catalog.  May handles songwriting, acoustic guitars and adds some amazing lead vocals. This song is tribute to the year 1939.  Great background vocals by both Taylor and Mercury.  I also give credit to Deacon for some great use of the double bass.    \\"Sweet Lady\\":  This song has a classic hard rock/heavy metal feel that Queen had now become famous for.  Mercury's vocals combined with May's guitars once again gel perfectly.    \\"Seaside Rendezvous\\": This is the second of the \\"vaudeville/ragtime\\" songs on this collection.  I think this is the best of three.  The amazing thing is how both Mercury and Taylor simulate woodwind and brass instrument sounds with vocals.    \\"The Prophet's Song\\": This is a darker song than the rest of the album.  It also has more of a theatrical feel as a throwback to the earlier days of Queen.     \\"Love of My Life\\": This has become a popular ballad by Queen - and Mercury in particular.  I always felt it was a bid overrated, but the use of the Harp in this song by May once again shows how this group just finds new ways to broaden musically.    \\"Good Company\\": This is the third of the \\"vaudeville/ragtime\\" songs on this collection.  This song is highlighted by May strumming a ukulele on this track combined with some Jazz guitar.    \\"Bohemian Rhapsody\\": This is just a legendary song. Music fans are well familiar with this song. I particularly love the three distinct parts to the song: 1) The Theatrical sounding ballad;  2) The Opera-tic choir performed by Mercury, May, and Taylor; and 3) The Heavy Metal-sounding jam led by May's guitars (my personal favorite).     \\"God Save the Queen\\": This is the album's wrap-up song as Queen covers the national anthem of the United Kingdom.  May's guitars are done in the style of Jimi Hendrix's \\"Star Spangled Banner\\".  This song would become the trademark finale at live Queen shows.    Overall, this fourth album by Queen shows why they are a Hall of Fame band.  This album is definitely worth checking out.  Highly recommended.
0060765380|4.0|I was a bit iffy about the title, thinking it was a take-off the old religious da Vinci code, but lucklily I had read Black Order and Loved it, so the title didn't deter me very long. And I learned something, which is always rewarding.  It's easy to become repetitious when writing a string of novels with the same characters, but in the case of James Rollins, nothing could be farther from the truth! He reinvents himself, challenges the reader and leaves you wanting to read more.    Definitely now on my must-read list!  Would've given 5* but for the quite descriptive subject matter...
032147404X|5.0|Scott Kelbys writing style is that of a friend telling you how to do something like a professional.  He doesn't take the fun out of things and still promotes self exploration as well as experimentation but in this the first of a series of books he shows you how he and other pro's do things.  If you're a budding photographer who wants to find out how to do the cool things in photography without sitting in endless hours of lectures or reading through hundreds of pages of information you already know this book is perfect, the information is precise and to the point yet not written in a condescending way.  Scott makes some great suggestions for both photographic equipment and additional stuff that just makes the job easier.  He doesn't get involved the in the Nikon V Canon debate, he just shows you what he does.  Highly recommended reading
B00169N0BK|1.0|First off, I'm no novice to color management, monitor profiling and ICC profile creation.  Previously I had been using Monaco EZColor which was a great product with fantastic personalized tech support until X-Rite bought them and gutted both the product and support.<br /><br />Anyway, I was really looking forward to ColorMunki so that I could get away from EZ Color's need for ITT target scanning and the laborious process required to create a monitor-paper profile.  While the software installed easily and the proces of creating a monitor-paper profile went smoothly, the results were horrible on my new Canon Pixma Pro9000.  Greenish casts to every profile, and worse, the default profile created for my monitor distorted all the colors.  Unlike EZ Color, when you create a monitor profile with Munki, it does not use the RGB sliders found on most higher-end monitors, so there is no way to compensate for under or over bias on one color.<br /><br />Calling X-Rite, while easy enough to get through, was a joke.  The only positive I can say about the experience is that the call seemingly stayed in the US, but the tech support guy was essentially useless.  When asked about how to correct my profile when using Photoshop CS3 he replied with the scripted answer that X-Rite does not support the use of their product with third party applications!  Well, what good is making a profile if you can't utilize it in your post-processing software?  He did take my e-mail and promise to send me some urls that might be pertainent to PS CS3 but as expected, the e-mail never arrived.<br /><br />All in all, I was tremendously disappointed with ColorMunki.  I had high expectataions that were dashed, surprsing for a $500 not-necessarily entry-level product.<br /><br />ADDENDUM:  In all fairness, I have to report that X-Rite read the above and contacted me by e-mail with an offer to assist me with the installation and usage of ColorMunki.  And, interestingly, the next day I did receive a response from the original T.S. person (who I may have unfairly maligned in the above review) with a link to some assistance for CS3.  I am away on a photo shoot at the time these e-mails arrived, so I will have to wait until I return to try out their assistance.I may have unfairly maligned in the above review) with a link to some assistance for CS3.

B000LPQ6DE|5.0|what a beautiful tale cast with exceptional actors!  i've seen many versions and this is my favorite hands down!!
B000005JA8|5.0|Thought I would make a few comments about this album just for a laugh. It is a long album - nearly 80 minutes. It is all gripping. Lyrics excellent. music excellent. vocals excellent. There are a lot of references to animals. beefheart used to sculpt animals lol. There is amazing balance in the rhythms and is all very natural.  People go on about the weirdness of the music but it is actually mainly the words and vocals that give this album the edge. Beefheart is an unusual guy and his words reflect his unusual mind. But the quality of lyrics is often ignored or under-appreciated. He is right up there with anyone in rock in that department. Take neon meat dream of an octafish. It is about sex. really hard to imagine anyone else writing in such a manner. outstanding. im uncomfortable about my human gets me blues and one or two irreverant moments due to my christian faith but that song apart this is one of my fave albums lyrics wise. veterans day poppy has genuine poignancy. etc. , etc. Of course, it is not exactly middle of the road musically but as many here point out it is not that far from the centre really and it is based on the blues - a sort of extension of that form. beefheart had mastered the blues already by the time of his debut album :) One more thing, this record has a singular impact in the way it all ties together as an interconnected whole. if i simply hear the phrase 'fast n bulbous' or 'ella guru' or whatever i get a certain feeling that only comes from this record. Almost like hearing the whole thing without actually hearing it :) A true classic and well worth all the fuss it gets.

Either way it's an inability to face the facts of what this move represents.... the utter, brutal and cold facts about who we ALL are!  Proof again that people don't like the truth!  \\"Truth is a game... we all play to win.\\"  As a side note, those who rate this poorly are nothing more than bending, compromising Anna's... a depressive defined as=  \\"they want to be unhappy to confirm they're depressed.

B0000DBJDM|5.0|Pink Floyd Live At Pompeii - Great, great, great, great!!!! This DVD contains the \\"Director's Cut\\" as well as the original concert film. Basically the Director's cut features lots of extra visuals, including computer graphic recreations of Pompeii, the exploding Vesuvius, and other things like NASA shots of rockets going up into space, space walks, images of suns and stars and moons and planets, all the usual things you'd expect of someone depicting a \\"space rock\\" band. It also has some extra bits from the studio in Paris when they were recording \\"Dark Side of the Moon.\\" The Directors Cut starts out with space and planets animated instead of the big zoom-in to the arena in Pompeei of the original film. Not really an improvement, although it's nice to see something different I guess. Cool to see a grand piano in a roman ampitheatre. Gilmour and Wright shirtless, Waters and Mason in black. Integrates black and white studio shots with colour live stuff from Pompeii. Guys walking over steaming earth, awkward cuts to Wright and Gilmour screwing up their Echoes lyrics. Mason flips his drum stick. Broken drum heads on his kit - 8 drums and 5 cymbals. Racks and racks of amps - one shot goes behind them and we see the cameras and crews that face the band. Back of amps all say \\"Pink Floyd. London.\\" Shots of the London Underground, clock going backwards, empty platform. Throwaway film experimentation. Pink Floyd's psychedelic breakfast at Abbey Road studios as Nick goes weird about apple pie, Roger's veins as he tries out weird keyboard sounds. Talking about over-using equipment. \\"It's like saying `give a man a Les Paul guitar and he'll become Eric Clapton.\\" Did Clapton play a Les Paul? Constructing the \\"On The Run\\" sequence with sequencers and keyboards. \\"Careful With That Axe Eugene\\" with wild lava flows and screams. The and eating oysters. \\"There's the danger of becoming slaves to the equipment, it happened before. Can't hide behind equipment.\\" Saucerful of Secrets - Waters smashing cymbols with toms, Wright attacking his grand. Fly on Waters' arm - smashes gong that we see on the cover art - all of the guys thin and trim and gangly in t-shirts and jeans, barefoot sand getting into the effects pedals. The band talks money and economics, \\"rock is not dying like they say,\\" and there's still money in it. Wright doing piano parts in shades fo r \\"Us and Them\\" as camera sweeps around. Gilmour \\"we're not a drug-oriented group. You can trust us.\\" \\"One of These Days\\", mason on toms on ctymbols, weird geographic CG. Slow-mo on Mason as the song kicks into high gear, all you see is him, no Gilmour solo or Waters screaming. Mason loses a stick, then pulls a new one out. Nice butterfly logo on blue long-sleeve shirt. Keyboard too high in the mix. Interesting quotes about how well they've learned how to get along, \\"we're happy together.\\" That wouldn't last. While the others are chatting, Gilmour pulls a perfect \\"Echoes\\" guitar solo. \\"Mesdomoiselle Nobs\\" with the wailing dog - Wright holding the dog, who sings on cue, Gilmour on harmonica, Waters on guitar (although it sounds like a bass) Address the topic of arguments and in-fighting by claiming that they have the same sense of humour and lust for money. \\"We can still combine our interest. That's when it breaks down, when one person finds that wheat he's doing isn't interesting, thinks he can do better by himself,\\" says Mason. Then shifts to Gilmour noodling on the guitar, gives a big beautiful smile when he notices the camera. \\"What would rock `n' roll be without feedback?\\" Gilmour plays heavy, thick guitar solos on \\"Brain Damage,\\" they obviously were never used since the finished product is much more relaxed. \\"Set The Controls For the Heart Of The Sun\\", Mason's purple butterfly t-shirt - he has two? \\"Echoes\\" in studio - Gilmour stops singing - is he being a prick? Images of Roman erotica, humans cavorting with fauns. Closing \\"Echoes\\" - sunnyday Pink Floyd with other backdrops.  TERRIBLE computergraphics bit (1:23:35).  DVD extras. Generally not great, although there is some good stuff.  Three posters, one of which calls the show \\"A Zappaesque musical pastiche.\\"  Three newspaper articles from the day.  Five \\"covers of bootlegs\\" pages with two on each page, so 10 covers.  Four previous covers.  Four albums' with graphics, two songs' lyrics (why only two? why bother?), one 24-minute interview with directore Adrian Maben that was very interesting.  No voice of the interviewer, questions appear as banners.  He explains some of the reasons why there were so many wanky graphics and things, he complains that \\"you are always unsatisfied with something, you never get it right,\\" and I think that even after 30 years he's ruined his chance to \\"fix\\" his mistakes.  But he didn't have much to work with - apparently the rushes were lost, so he couldn't add any material from 1972 into the film, so he put 2003 stuff in.  Big mistake.  I read on the Wikipedia that the shots from the studio in Paris that was supposedly of them recording \\"Dark Side of the Moon\\" was actually faked - the band had already finished recording the album and were mixing it.  Other fake shots were done on a sound stage somewhere.  You can tell which ones they were because there are no ruins of Pompeii, the band are squeezed together, and Rick Wright is beardless.

B000148KK2|5.0|Tremendous disc. Diana's voice is great, the mike is close with a fantastic breathy texture to her voice. Fantastic backing group with a swing/bluesy feel - rhythmic. I think her 'Temptation' is the best version I've ever heard of this track. More please!

B0000AUHQT|5.0|This stunning production with its splendid cinematography and its intelligent script by Francis Ford Coppola captures the essence of F. Scott Fitzgerald's novel of the man who pursues his preposterous dream. Robert Redford is utterly convincing as the enigmatic protagonist, Gatsby, whose personality \\"seemed to face . . . the whole external world for an instant, and then concentrated on you, with an irresistible prejudice in your favor\\" [Fitzgerald, Chapter 3].  Young Sam Waterston portrays a believable Nick Carraway, Fitzgerald's narrator and empathetic observer; and while some reviewers have criticized Mia Farrow's performance, in my view, she is pitch perfect as the shallow, spoiled young woman whose \\"artificial world was redolent of orchids and pleasant, cheerful snobbery and orchestras which set the rhythm of the year, summing up the sadness and suggestiveness of life in new tunes\\" [F. Ch. 8]. Farrow's performance makes us understand how Daisy's porcelain beauty and fecklessness could ignite the obsession of a man who has, after all, invented his own persona. Both of them are equally unreal.<br /><br />The production values are superb. The settings, the music, and magnificent costumes--the pastel beaded silks and satin pumps, the feathered head-dresses--convincingly portray privileged wealth of the 1920s, which would soon plummet into the Depression--the great Valley of Ashes that infected the 1930s and indeed contaminated the entire twentieth century.
B000ZLFALI|5.0|After hearing the reviews and not getting to see this masterpiece due to a cinema-phobic boyfriend I finally watched this on my home cinema. This is possibly the first film I have ever seen that I watched then watched all the extras and then watched the movie again. To say it is amazing is an understatement.
B00000ADG2|1.0|this album is wack the only 2 songs on here i like is<br /><br />1 nothing even matters<br />2 ex factory but other then that i was so diappointed when i bought this album 8 years ago i was salty this is the worse album i ever bought in my life besides whats the 411 by mary j blige
0345457692|4.0|Well paced and cinematic.  Just waiting for someone to scoop the rights!  See ya on the big screen
B00000AFFF|4.0|I was unaware of this collaboration however once I stumbed upon it I became intriqued.  Burt Bacharach's formula for beautiful music makes him a timeless producer along with Mr. Costello's writing makes this CD more enjoyable with each listen.
0385340567|1.0|What a disappointment!  Lee Child is one of my favorites and I always look forward to the new Reacher outing.  But this was almost unreadable, and I totally lost interest halfway through. Out of a sense of loyalty, I read much further than the book warranted.  And then I just stopped.  What happened there, Lee?  This was bad.
B00005JPY0|5.0|Ive never been much of a fan of Heath Ledger, or been interested in mostly anything hes done before \\"Dark Knight\\" but there cannot be a higher honor than to say that with his untimely death, there will never, ever be another Joker again. If anyone in hollywood, for the sake of greed or money, thinks they can just pick up and put anyone, no matter how good they are, back into this role that Ledger now owns, then they are severely and terribly mistaken. Remember, this is coming from a non-Ledger fan, at least until now.    His Joker portrayal can be included in the ranks of villains that you just hate to love, and although we're not supporting of or endorse the actions of these baddies in film, we cannot seem to shake the charisma or strange likeability that these bad guys possess. Darth Vader, Hannibel, Lex luthor (Hackman not Spacey), Robert Deniro's master thief (Heat) just to name a few. And now, we have Ledgers Joker to join this evil and esteemed list.    This movie is so much more than a fluff fest that most \\"superhero\\" movies tend to be (Ghost Rider, Daredevil) and yet it cannot be simply classified as a superhero movie, nor a horror movie, nor a crime drama, nor an action movie. Although others here have put it more eloquently than I plan to, this is the best of all combinations of the aforementioned genres.    Christian Bale is the only Batman Hollywood. This isnt James Bond with 10 different actors playing the part. There is only one Batman now, and lets just say it sure as hell isnt George Clooney.  There is only one Commish Gordon now, and his name is the much underrated and excellent Gary Oldman.  The list continues with Freeman and Eckert (Sp.) , the always delightful M. Caine, and of course now the late H. Ledger.    I would love to see a third installment to this wonderfully serious series, but none of these players above can nor should be replaced.    The standard has been set high, and to continue it would be like climbing mt. Everest. Hopefully Nolan knows that and declines to make a cheap, lazy buck like those INdy Jones guys this year (Spielberg and Lucas).     If Nolan feels he can continue to master this genius, then by all means, please continue, but if not, then please leave the masterpiece alone and refuse to sell out.    One last point. Some here seem to be complaining that this new \\"Dark Knight\\" series is too dark and violent for kids. This isnt meant to be a family film folks to take the kiddies to, dont you have enough of \\"Wall-e\\" and that Panda thing to take care of that, among so so many more yet to come?    This is an adult film, with certain fantasy elements, but well set into a most realistic, and sometimes brutally so, world.  It is what it is, and its, like another blogger wrote, purely a masterpiece.

B000Q7ZO8U|5.0|Not only is this a great movie for all ages, but owning it on Blu-ray is fantastic.  I have had the standard DVD for a few years but the Blu-ray DVD is truly several steps up in picture quality.  The colors are more vivid and sound is outstanding!
B001CB2A1I|5.0|Lisey's Story is a rich and tender story about true love, loss and the dark crevasses that childhood abuse can etch on the human psyche. This tale was a beautiful thing. I would love to see more stories like this one.
B0014CQNTK|5.0|This is such a wonderful, joyous, uplifting movie! Normally one wouldn't say that about a film centering around teen pregnancy, a failed marriage and broken hearts, but in his case? Yeah!    \\"Juno\\" for those of you who have been living in caves, is a film about a young girl who, after a night's indiscretion with her best friend, becomes pregnant. Initially planning to get an abortion, she changes her mind and decides to put the baby up for adoption. It goes from there.    What I like about this movie is that all the characters are treated with respect, especially Juno's parents who, when she tells them her \\"good\\" news, don't respond with the sort of hysterics you'd normally see in a movie. No, they handle it like you'd imagine such people would; quiet disapointment, but slightly proud of her for handling it as an adult.    The writing is sharp, though a little twee for the first twenty minutes or so. Then it settles down into a nice, intelligent screenplay that doesn't talk down to the audience. All the plot twists seem earned, and all the emotions seem real.    The acting all around is great, particularly Ellen Page as the title character. She brings a real charm and charisma to the movie that would be absent with almost anyone else in the role.    The movie isn't without flaws. Jason Bateman's character isn't handled as welll as I might like, but you know, otherwise, this movie has earned every single acolade and award it's received and then some. It's a really, really good movie.
0385337388|5.0|I've read this book 2 1/2 times now. The first time I only got through half - I was a premed and being a liberal feminist I was offended by the treatment of women. The second time I read it all the way through - I was a first year med student and after ignoring the sexist stuff it was a very funny read - but not all of it was accessible to me with my limited medical knowledge at the time. The third read was recently as a 4th year student. Even more hilarious now that I've been through the experience of the wards. Highly recommended!
B0019FOC5E|5.0|Just got back from seeing the movie and am currently listening to the soundtrack...absolutely loved it!  It's a must see for everyone!!
B0019FOC5E|5.0|Amanda Seyfried and Meryl Streep make this music so enjoyable.  They sang their numbers as well as the performers when I saw the Broadway show.  Pierce Brosnan tries, and is OK for the most part, especially in \\"SOS.\\"  Just leave out the toast after the wedding!  :(  If you get the chance to see the movie, DO IT!!!! If you like ABBA or the play, you will not be disappointed.
B00005JPSM|5.0|On tonight's menu, we are serving a romantic comedy that will satisfy the most discriminatory palate.  Devoid of nudity and foul language, \\"No Reservations\\" is a touching, heart warming comedy that is suitable for all ages.  It has a very upbeat, positive finale that can only be found in a modern fairytale.<br /><br />  Catherine Zeta-Jones is wonderful as Kate who is one of the best chefs in New York; unfortunately, she seeks solace and comfort in the kitchen of an upscale restaurant.  Her daily routine is turned upside down when tragedy forces her to becomes a parent to her niece, and a handsome, dashing chef (Aaron Eckhart) is hired to assist her in the kitchen.  During the course of the movie, Kate metamorphoses from a self-isolated, suspicious person into someone who can trust, love and share her world.<br /><br />  Great performances are given by everyone, especially Abigail Breslin who is very convincing as Kate's orphaned niece, Zoe; Zoe has a hard time adjusting to the loss of her mother and your heart will break for her.<br /><br />  Catherine Zeta-Jones and Aaron Eckhard look great together.  Their kissing is very passionate.  They are able to heat up the kitchen without turning on the stove.<br /><br />  \\"No Reservations\\" comes highly recommended; it will make a great addition to anyone's collection of romantic comedies.  Watch it tonight; reservations aren't required.
B000025XKM|5.0|Like, and not like, ROBERT JOHNSON's Blues, PINK MOON is NICK DRAKE's masterpiece for the fan of Folk Rock, but this record Rocks not, yet is quite Bluesy.  The unusual and spare guitar, with NICK DRAKE's unique tuning, is reminiscent of the great American Blues artists like JOHNSON and SKIP JAMES, and yet, it is something else, something other, something more.  These short songs are constructed of DRAKE's idiosyncratic guitar and melancholy lyrics that are not quite circular, but softer, more introspective and I'd dare say \\"organic,\\" and only because NICK DRAKE is so... different.  And also because his expressions are all Earthy:  morning moon sun stars ...Yet like the Blues, these tunes have deeply personal themes borne of individual pain.<br /><br />Not really Orpheus wooing Eurydice with a guitar (as the Rolling Stone Album Guide calls it) it's more rustic than that, Celtic, but still timelessly dreamy, ethereal, and yes, a bit spooky, PINK MOON is an artist fully realizing his potential and expressing it.  Ephemeral, romantic, insidiously charming, alluringly poetic, PINK MOON is the record that music lovers eventually find, will find, should find, in their dreamscape.  Unforgettable and indescribable, this soft, lilting record is of a voice not really like anyone you've heard before, and won't hear again, unless you know or have known the dark angel murmuring in your dream night.
0316001821|4.0|When I told anyone who asked what this book was about, they invariably replied \\"that sounds awful\\". Being a story of a family's grief after their daughter is murdered, you'd think so. But the author does a wonderful job of making it real and readable at the same time - it's not like reading of an awful murder story on [...]. I'll admit the beginning is a little difficult to read, not impossible but...unpleasant I guess. And I think the idea of watching your family grieve for you from heaven would be torture. Having said that, it was an enjoyable read and I would recommend it to my friends.
B000024D4R|3.0|I have mixed feelings with Animals.  While some people are quick to claim it the very best Floyd album, others (like me) are very skeptical of that.      You see, the thing I mostly like Pink Floyd for was their highly unusual and distinct atmosphere that made the band both interesting and complex.  By the late 70's, the band stopped including psychedelic elements.  Now, I understand that was starting to go out of style by that time as punk, disco and new wave were on the horizon.  But to me that means the band should have just broken up after Wish You Were Here, because without that strange atmosphere the band were the masters at, you now just have a songwriting album with nothing to back up the ordinary songs.      That's what happened with Animals.  Sure, I can remember how the songs go because the 70's were a very memorable decade.  So to some extent I still like the album.  There ARE some good guitar tricks too, such as the way the guitar work plays at the end of \\"Sheep\\", which is FANTASTIC    But seriously, \\"Dogs\\" NEEDED to be about 7 minutes shorter, and the band should have made another song out of those 7 minutes (I don't know, call it \\"Cats\\").    But without the psychedelic sounds, the band was rather ordinary to me.  How people can put this album on the same level as A Saucerful of Secrets is a mystery to me.  It's a good enough effort, but the Wall just further proves the band was heading in a direction that never should have happened in the first place.
B000WGWQG8|5.0|I just finished watching HBO miniseries \\"John Adams\\"--based on the book by David McCullough--on DVD and I must say, I thought it was excellent.  The movie does a great job of capturing the life of John Adams and his relationships with his wife Abigail and his friend and fellow revolutionary Thomas Jefferson.  The miniseries follows Adams from the Boston Massacre to his death at his home in 1826.  It covers all of the periods of Adams' life, and the Revolutionary War period is treat with as much importance as any other period.  That being said, the previews which lead you to believe this movie is only about the Revolutionary War are a little misleading.<br /><br />Both Paul Giamatti and Laura Linney are great in this miniseries as the Adamses, and Stephen Dilliane is also very good as Jefferson.  I do wish this miniseries had focused a little more on the politics of early America and a little less on the family, but you can't have everything!<br /><br />I would recommend this movie to any fan of McCullough or to anyone interested in the Revolutionary War period.  The miniseries is an excellent viewing experience, and well worth the time investment.
B000002B7M|3.0|I can't believe so many people actually prefer Ozzy Osbourne's solo career over Black Sabbath.  The stuff he was doing with Sabbath was groundbreaking and unlike anything else in the 70's, not to mention more satisfying from a heavy metal perspective.  Take Ozzy's high pitch vocals and combine them with Sabbath guitarist Tony Iommi's extremely dark and heavy riffs, Geezer Butler's influential galloping bass work and Bill Ward's \\"fill between the riffs\\" drumming style, and you have yourself a legendary band.<br /><br />Blizzard of Oz is just a slightly faster, but more predictable (songwriting-wise) effort compared to the stuff he was doing with Black Sabbath.  Not to discredit Randy Rhoads of course who's obviously deserving of his reputation as a guitar wizard.  The fact he died in an airplane accident at such a young age really is unfortunate since he had a lot more potental and happiness to bring to millions of fans.<br /><br />But... the quality of the songwriting on Blizzard of Ozz leaves a lot to be desired.  It has the big hits such as \\"I Don't Know\\" which over the last 10 years or so has caught on as far as radio exposure goes, and of course \\"Crazy Train\\" is a classic.  No songwriting complaints with these two tracks.  Randy Rhoads is just a fantastic guitarist and \\"Crazy Train\\" captures the very best of his abilities.  It's just a shame Ozzy wanted to take his heavy metal in a cheesy direction.  \\"Steal Away (The Night)\\" is a pretty decent song with a shorter Sammy Hagar-commercialized approach with a memorable chorus.<br /><br />How people can honestly say this stuff is great while the Never Say Die album is average is a total mystery to me.  No way.<br /><br />\\"Goodbye to Romance\\" is a pretty bad ballad.  Ozzy was never very good at these kind of songs, even with Black Sabbath.  However, with Sabbath, at least the other band members had the creativity to spice up the ballads with mellotrons and other interesting arrangements.  We don't have Sabbath to helpOzzy's ballads anymore, leaving Ozzy searching for ways to make his ballads interesting without the members of Sabbath.  The only part of \\"Goodbye to Romance\\" I actually like is the ending when it fades away in an exceptionally sad way.  It perfectly captures the feeling of saying goodbye.  But 5 minutes of this stuff?  No way<br /><br />\\"Mr. Crowley\\" is pretty boring.  It never really goes anywhere and it's overlong.  You either like it or you don't.  I never understood the worldwide appeal of this track.  It doesn't really rock- only Rhoads guitar work saves it.  \\"Revelation (Mother Earth)\\" has vocals identical to Black Sabbath's \\"She's Gone\\" (the one misstep in classic Sabbath's career).  The lyrics about empires falling are pretty good, but the melody itself is bland.  The arrangements are quite unusual too.  I hear Peter Frampton-like guitar trickery in a few spots.  I will say this- I absolutely LOVE the guitar riff around 3 minutes in.  Totally reminiscent of Tony Iommi and the Sabotage period of Black Sabbath, and just flat out *awesome*.  Another awesome part is the Castlevania: Symphony of the Night-resembling piano melody during the second half.  Strange touch of elegance there, haha.<br /><br />Overall, nah, it's not a classic, and I recommend you pick up some Black Sabbath albums instead.  However if you must go with an Ozzy Osbourne album, make it Diary of a Madman which owns this one.
0553583182|5.0|Hi everyone. I just wanted to share my experience with this book. I applied it once to pass my exams (and I passed 2 of my biggest exams in one month, which was amazing, and it was based on \\"luck\\" because after I prepared approx. 30-40% of my exams, I got the right questions - I used to repeat, repeat, repeat \\"I order to the power of my subconscious mind to make me pass these exams\\" and it happened. I strongly believe you ought to be positive about the outcome because I also saw the opposite happen to people - they would prepare 149 questions and skip one, and get that one on the exam!!    Well, it's been a while since then.. once I got a job I wanted because I really concentrated on that.. I also like The Secret, but the Subconscious Mind communicates better with my \\"logical\\" mind, because it gives more explanations on \\"how it works\\"..    Thanks for reading this!
B000X5SPBI|5.0|I have watched all the season's of Supernatural and feel that with each season the show gets better.  I loved season three, didn't care for Bella, but RUBY?  Now she is another story.  Some of the nay sayers on here for some reason have an issue with her.  I feel she greatly added to the show and really hope they keep her in the coming seasons.  There were plenty of stand alone episodes, but of course Dean's deal was going to be the MOST important part of season 3.  How anyone could NOT get why he made that deal is beyond me, just re-watch 1 & 2 and maybe you will understand.  His love for Sam, his feelings of responsibilty for him?  Come on, it wasn't such a stretch.  I felt this was the best season yet and look forward to many more!
B00005JPY0|5.0|I know, it sounds crazy, but that's the feeling I got many times while watching this movie. It's obvious that it's a commentary on human nature, the limits of decency, the naivete of innocents, torture, real threats and real evil, and the War on Terror - but it's a commentary that favors Bush, especially the last few minutes, where the Batman willingly takes on the vilification of the masses for their own good.<br /><br />The movie is astounding; so many questions, so many interesting answers, as you can see from the above. Should torture - or at least the American versions of it, such as making terrorists listen to Rod Stewart - be used when lives are at stake? The movie says \\"yes.\\" Should leaders make tough choices that are necessary but unpopular? Ditto there. Should we be yanked around by the demands of terrorists? \\"No.\\" Should security be a top priority? \\"Yes.\\" And on and on it goes - almost an apologia for this President.<br /><br />Even the strange feature of the Joker's changing \\"origin stories\\" brought to mind Osama Bin Laden's changing explanations for bringing about 9/11 (first, it was because of the American presence in the Middle East, then, much later, when he realized his mistake, he added that it was for the Palestinians).<br /><br />Ledger's performance is also astounding, as are most of the cast. Maggie Glyenhall is annoying, but that's because her character is. She will pay the price for her unrealistic idealism (or is it?). The Batman has a moment of decision which seems to all of us to be capitulation. Again, a comment on terrorism - and you know everyone in the theater is thinking, \\"NO, don't give in to his demands!\\" Harvey Dent is willing to push the envelope to get answers, although the Batman reveals that he had an intelligence failure. Not sure where that goes.<br /><br />There is a possible message about terrorists trying to bring us down to their level, and what we choose. But on the balance, we are made to understand that some people just cannot be reasoned with. They have a worldview which means our destruction, period. No matter how much we insist that they're wrong and just don't understand themselves, that deep down they're really just like us, they don't need therapy or understanding; they need to be fought.<br /><br />These are my impressions, and I'm sure more thoughts are percolating about this complex movie right now. But it's another amazing achievement that these messages slipped right past the usual suspects - the ring of critics that hates Bush, yet applauded this movie. Perhaps that should give us hope, that in the end we will stand united against all cults of death.<br /><br />UPDATE: It's not just me! Andrew Klavan also noticed it.

These are my impressions, and I'm sure more thoughts are percolating about this complex movie right now. But it's another amazing achievement that these messages slipped right past the usual suspects - the ring of critics that hates Bush, yet applauded this movie.

0767812166|3.0|Scott Hayden was killed in an explosion in a spacecraft accident.  The Starman appreared on the scene in Jennie Hayden as a baby developed from birth until grown man, after adapting face from Scott's photograph.  He has three days to meet a starship in the Arizona crater in order to return to his planet.  Along the way, he got a ride with a cook.  What he thinks he will miss the most is eating: the apple pie was magnico and the cherry pie was delicious.    \\"You are at your very best when things are the worst,\\" he says about humans.  Though technically far beyond us, he learns much from Jennie who is patient and understanding with him.  He leaves behind a human baby with his knowledge, and Scott's genes (from a strand of his hair).  The Extraterrestrial Agency lets things go.  In five minutes, he must reach his rendeavous, so he lied about the other person, \\"guy is older.\\"    He uses symbolism in his descriptions.  What the Heck is that?  \\"I must go.  I care now, tell me again how to say goodbye.\\"  Jennie Hayden appears like a better-nourished Cindy.  \\"Kiss me, tell me you love me.\\"  The aircraft is a blue glow, though much bigger than the one  in the new somewhat like flick now at the movies, \\"Meet Dave.\\"

Kubrick wanted Barry Lyndon to have a 'washed out' look but the DVD displays the clearly visible degradation of the original film negative.The same could be said for the 2001 DVD. Perhaps HD versions are already on their way!
B000002KZ6|5.0|I second the pull up the roots comment! Might be my favorite song on the whole album. This entire album is awesome though, and its really good on a long drive in the summertime.
B000TFINY6|5.0|This is an amazing season, and watching it on blu-ray is quite a treat. If you think that it couldn't look any better than it's dvd counterpart (upscaled), then think again. The colors are very vibrant, and the environment is lush and alive. The sound is top notch also you feel as though you are on the island with them.    As far as the season itself goes, I really enjoyed it. Lost is a very mysterious show and this season raises more questions, although it does answer a few questions viewers were waiting for. It has a very awesome ending too.     In conclusion, if you love Lost and have a blu-ray player, please get this it's worth the extra money. You won't be disappointed.
B00005JPY0|5.0|I have not written up a review of a movie in years.  This movie has brought me back.  Not only is the movie one of the best super hero movies ever, it is also one of the best movies I have ever seen.  And wouldn't you know it, the very actor that made this movie such a thrill ride has, to my sincere sadness, has passed on.  What a character and a film to go out on though.  If Heath was here today he would become the new golden boy in hollywood.  I never cared for Heath or most of his movies.  He's always shown himself to be a great actor but now, after watching him as the joker, I must say he has proven brilliant and oscar bound.  Funny enough, his death had nothing to do with the fact that his portrayal of the joker surpasses all of my favorite movie characters of all time including Jack Sparrow, John McClane, Sgt. Dignum, ect.  It may have drawn people in to come see it, but when the crowd walks out of this movie they will find themselves \\"joker\\" fans or even Heath Ledger fans, and will not even think about his death.  Although Heathe is gone, in a miraculous way, his last character will never die and will be remembered and watched forever.  Sorry Mr. Nicholson, you're one of my favorite actors but you are no longer the joker.  As you can see I have mentioned nothing of all of the other actors including Christian Bale.  Well that is because the show was stolen by the villian.  Everyone does fantastically and the joker is out of this world brilliant and captivating.  I will see this movie several times and every time I do I will hang on every word Heath Ledger delivers.  I will look forward to seeing the oscars next year, and expect this movie to be rereleased for Academy Award viewing.  I hope Heath is somewhere where he can see the greatness of this picture.
B000ZBPPWC|3.0|The Belcea has done some good Haydn and Mozart, but I feel they are overmatched in the Bartoks.  Both violinists lack the weight of tone these quartets demand, and I find the ensemble seriously clueless in the first, fifth, and sixth quartets.  I still haven't lost affection for my first set, the Juilliard on Sony, but for a pretty much definitive set, I'd go with the Takacs on Decca.

B00127RAJY|4.0|The first time that I did level 1, I had to take a few breaks.  I workout between 4 -5 times a week and thought I was in decent shape.  This is a good workout and gets you in shape quick.  By the 2nd time, I was able to do the entire workout and then proceed to level 2.  The reason I didn't give it 5 stars is because there are a few things that affect my knees.  It may be too much stress on the knees if you have knee problems.  Other than that, I like the fact that it's only 27 minutes total and it gives me incentive to keep on doing it.
B000UBMSB8|5.0|[[ASIN:B000UBMSB8 Blade Runner (Four-Disc Collector's Edition)]] is definitely, and definitely, in my top five list.    Excellent Ridley Scott directed sci-fi based on the book [[ASIN:0345404475 Do Androids Dream of Electric Sheep?]] by Phillip K. Dick, in my opinion one of the best sci-fi writers of all time.    Pour yourself a cold one and sit back and relax for a mind bending film noir exploration of computer evolution...as only Ridley Scott can do.      Can man actually create a sentient silicon-based lifeform in his own image?  And, if he actually succeeds, what do we do with these \\"units\\" when they go bad?    Watch Harrison Ford, Edward James Olmos,Sean Young, Rutgar Hauer, Daryl Hanna, and M. Emmet Walsh combine for a gripping tour of life on earth, in Scott's version of the future, as they explore just exactly what it means to be human.
0756404746|5.0|If you are rushed or distracted, don't read this book.  Rushing through this would be like gulping down a fine wine as though it were apple juice (a crime!).  Rather, get everything done that you need to get done, put the kids to bed (if you have any), turn off the tv and pour yourself a dram of whatever you love best.  Find a comfortable chair and warm lighting, and enjoy.<br /><br />This first installment is mainly a narrative of the life of a man named Kvothe, and it is rich with heart-moving imagery and subtley laced with the perfect amount of wry, tongue-in-cheek humor; yet there is an underlying sense of tragedy and forboding that pervades the tale throughout that actually builds suspense so gradually that it's almost feels subconscious.<br /><br />Highly recommended.
B00005JPY0|3.0|Electrifyingly darker than even Tim Burton's original vision, Batman: The Dark Knight is certainly no family film. Packed with explosive action, heavy-hitting violence, and diabolical maniacs, the masked vigilante has never looked or felt more intense. But despite the many attempts at seriousness, realism still evades the Dark Knight, as inexplicable technology comes to the rescue and a jarring lack of security allows villains to plot elaborate schemes. And despite a flawless performance by Heath Ledger as Batman's archrival The Joker, the film weakens as Two-Face steals screen time from what was plenty enough mayhem for a single superhero.<br /><br />The gangsters who run the underworld of Gotham City are continually under the scrutiny of the mysterious vigilante Batman (Christian Bale). Aided by a new district attorney, Harvey Dent (Aaron Eckhart), and his lawyer girlfriend Rachel Dawes (Maggie Gyllenhaal), the town begins to crack down on organized crime, forcing the mobsters to turn to extreme measures. And that's when they let the clown out of the box.<br /><br />A horribly disfigured psychotic masochist who dons face paint and a purple suit, known as The Joker (Heath Ledger), hires himself out to the warring gangs to dispose of Batman. But in his attempts to kill the pesky vigilante hero, he proves uncontrollable and unstable, and continues to spread panic and pandemonium through the streets of Gotham. Firstly targeting everyone close to Harvey Dent and Commissioner Gordon (Gary Oldman), The Joker terrorizes the city with explosives and death, and proves to everyone that he is absolutely not a laughing matter.<br /><br />And indeed, the most impressive aspect of The Dark Knight is Heath Ledger's performance. Made up with a truly sinister appearance, including hideous scars and devilish clown makeup, the film wastes no time with giving this notorious antagonist a backstory. Opening with a bank robbery scene that rivals the intensity in Heat's unforgettable holdup, Dark Knight leaps right into the action and rarely lets up. Despite the comic relief provided by Michael Caine's Alfred and Morgan Freeman's Lucius Fox, the film stays deadly serious so much of the time that it's difficult to see any light at the end of the tunnel.<br /><br />The unrelentingly baleful tone of the film makes The Dark Knight a perfect match to Batman Begins, and a real treat for fans itching for stark realism; but much of the over-the-top fun of the character has altogether vanished. It is no longer friendly for younger audiences. But despite the severe switch in target audiences, adults may find themselves questioning the ease with which The Joker is able to move around the city, plant bombs, and avoid gunfire. And sadly, as Spider-man 3 single-handedly proved, having too many villains can be dreadfully detrimental. Fears are confirmed when the enraged Harvey Dent starts to transform into his alter ego, Two-Face. The creative team behind The Dark Knight went to great lengths to achieve realism with the scar tissue and makeup for The Joker, but went drastically overboard on Two-Face. Believability is completely discarded for the sake of shocking.<br /><br />With amazing action sequences, a new Batcycle toy to play with, thrilling car chases, awe-inspiring stunts, bazookas, the demolition of buildings, and generally entertaining anarchy, The Dark Knight may be too mortifying for some, and just right for others - but Batman films always prove to be box office gold.<br /><br />- Mike Massieright into the action and rarely lets up.

0670020745|4.0|I loved it, BUT it may not be so enjoyable to a non-medical person. I was a little disappointed because the reviews said it would teach me how to better use my \\"right brain.\\" This it didn't do well. A good read, neverless!
0307346617|4.0|As others have said, this book is written from the point of view of a reporter interviewing survivors of \\"World War Z\\" which was a battle of zombies vs humans.  Unlike many/most Zombie movies which focus on a few people trying to survive such an outbreak, this book covers just about every location on earth to some extent in the stories related.    For the most part, the book is well done.  The interviews are arranged chronologically so that it creates a coherent narrative of the events.  One minor issue I had was that since I read this over the course of a week, I didn't realize that some earlier interviews were broken into multiple sections throughout the book.  It would have been nice to have a '... Interview continued with <name>\\" type of comment to help the reader reconnect with the previous interview.      One other niggle I had is that the various people interviewed didn't really stand out from each other much.  One or two had 'memorable' voices, but most of the rest 'sounded' pretty much the same.  It's certainly not easy to create separate voices for characters, and when they primarily speak in 'monologoue' I'm sure it's even harder to do.    That said, it's a very good book.  It feels as though it's a historical record, and provides enough details in cases to satisfy those who want a touch of the grisly and disturbing, but usually these moments are brief and certainly not horribly graphic most of the time.    Recommended.
0385474547|1.0|This is probably the worst book I've ever read.  It's very difficult to follow and leaves out much which could explain to the uninitiate the point of the book.  As someone who has read thousands of books (literally!),  I found this one stilted and forced, unreadable, pointless, unpleasant, poor character development, etc. ad nauseum.  The only reason I read it is that I couldn't believe my 8th grader when he said the teacher who assigned it said it was a bad book (and, yes, she assigned it anyway!).  It is an excellent example of how not to write a book you want people to read.  Avoid this one like the plague, unless you've read every other book on the face of the planet.
B00005OM5L|5.0|I bought this dvd for three dollars at a subway shop in South Korea, and it was well-worth the amount of money I paid. Clapton gives a great performance. Though \\"Tearin' Us Apart\\" is not really my type of song, I enjoy every other tune on this disc. \\"It Hurts Me Too\\" and \\"Have You Ever Loved A Woman\\" are especially excellent. I was previously unfamiliar with \\"Holy Mother\\", which, while not in the same league with his older solo material, recordings with Cream, or even Blues covers, is enjoyable. Hopefully, when people watch this dvd, they will become more interested in Muddy Waters, Freddie King, Eddie Boyd and Elmore James, whose songs are performed on this disc. Clapton is not a Bluesman, but serves as a gateway to the Blues for young people. I hope that people who enjoy this dvd will seek out cds featuring men like Elmore James, Muddy Waters, Eddie Boyd and Freddie King.
B0000CF30C|4.0|There's not a lot more to actually say about the CD itself; its a classic in blues/rock that still gets me jumpin'.   The only thing left to do with it is to \\"refresh\\" it, by improving the resolution, and debatably, making it a multi-channel format. Well, they succeeded on one front, in that the resolution is as superb as sacd will allow, in other words, outstanding. Mind you, this is before the recording engineers of today RUINED rock and pop recordings by increasing the dynamic range until everything is distorted and un-listenable, so this sounds quite good.    Where there is debate however is the multi-channel mixing of the sacd. Is it your cup of tea? Its not always mine, simply because I don't like to hear the rhythm guitars in the rear; I like to hear my music (usually) in stereo...centered in the front. Also, the multi-channel mixing is up to the taste of the engineers or the band--they decide WHAT goes WHERE: Do the vocals go in the center channel, or through the main speakers? Where do the guitars, drums, background vocals go? Its all up for interpretation. At its best multi-channel mixing DISAPPEARS and is unobtrusive--everything just blends in and creates a immersive wall of sound. At its worst, its corny, gimmicky, and the instruments don't fit in. This mix lies somewhere in between...its not bad, just not the best I've ever heard. What makes it worth buying is that you can finally hear this classic in sacd detail. And besides, you can always down-mix it to sacd stereo if you want. You decide. Hey, you might LOVE the multi-channel mix anyway.  The other con is that it is ONLY playable on a sacd player...this is NOT a hybrid disc.

B00003W8NM|4.0|If you were a guy, you hated \\"Girl Interrupted\\".  \\"Fight Club\\" is the male equivalent of \\"Girl Interrupted\\":  Both films were based on a novel by a popular writer, and both are films most members of the opposite sex seem to really hate.<br /><br />I don't know anything about Chuck Palahniuk or his novels, but after seeing \\"Fight Club\\", I would say that he was very successful in communicating to his target audience the idea that he had something to say.  Now, it's my turn.<br /><br />To be blunt, I thought that everything about \\"Fight Club\\" was predictable.  However, a film with a cult following this big has to be taken seriously.<br /><br />On the surface, \\"Fight Club\\" is about what happens to the male psyche when things break down.  That's the synopsis, which gradually proceeds to a plot twist about ¾ of the way into the film.<br /><br />On another level, \\"Fight Club\\" is only going to appeal to males who are attempting to establish an identity for themselves.  That's the underlying theme. Not that many guys over the age of thirty are going to be able to relate to this stuff.  This film is strictly for the \\"X box\\" generation.<br /><br />It used to be worth it to want acceptance from your peers.  Now, it's seen as a sign of weakness. At the beginning of \\"Fight Club\\", the Edward Norton character hangs out in 12 Step groups and cancer survivor groups in an attempt to be noticed.  (Dude! I can relate!) Eventually, the Edward Norton character gravitates towards self-actualization, culminating in ultrareality, or proximity thereof.<br /><br />At almost two and a half hours, \\"Fight Club\\" was way too long.  It should have been abbreviated to about an hour and a half. Also, it would actually have made more sense to truncate and manipulate the sequence of scenes (i.e., show the ending near the middle of the film, the beginning at the end, etc.), much like \\"Pulp Fiction\\".<br /><br />I was also disappointed in the story's deadpan ending and was half expecting a more bizarre twist:  Either Chuck Norris or Gina Gershon appearing in an onscreen cameo to announce, \\"It blowed up real good.\\"<br /><br />John Hinkley thought that by killing Ronald Reagan, he would eventually be able to fall in love and achieve orgasm with Jodi Foster.  At one time, I never would have been able to believe that \\"Taxi Driver\\" would inspired anyone to blow their nose.  Or that \\"The Basketball Diaries\\" would be the inspiration for a massacre in Colorado.  Hey, it's supposed to be entertainment, right?<br /><br />I don't know about \\"Fight Club\\" the novel, but I would imagine that probably a half-dozen (at least) new John Hinkleys and Timothy McVeighs are - right now, as you read this - being inspired by this film.  Which is ironic because it would appear to me that the only inspiration anyone had in the conception of \\"Fight Club\\" (the novel and film) was to get a decent paycheck by pandering to the readership of \\"MAXIM\\" magazine.<br /><br />In 1999, when this film was released, the white, male, under 25 target audience for this film understood that \\"Fight Club\\" was a guy film from beginning to end, not a dinner and a date movie. It was sort of a male religious experience.  At that point in time, the war in Iraq and 9/11 was still a glint in someone's eye.  Then, after 9/11, this film became less relevant.<br /><br />Groucho Marx once said, \\"I'll never watch a film where the man's t*ts are bigger that the woman's.\\"  Now that's advice worth taking.<br /><br />I rate \\"Fight Club\\" an A+ for effort, but a B- for content.ring in an onscreen cameo to announce, \\"It blowed up real good.\\"     John Hinkley thought that by killing Ronald Reagan, he would eventually be able to fall in love and achieve orgasm with Jodi Foster.

B0013FNC38|5.0|How Jason Mraz doesn't get more radio play is a mystery to me. This is the best music anyone is putting out in this genre and for some reason we never hear it. I did see the video to \\"I'm Yours\\" on MTV, but he deserves more airplay. The music is layered and has complexity to it, but the sound is all summer and sunshine. It is perfect driving in the car heading someplace fun music. He takes chances musically and lyrically. I like the album top to bottom and I have listened to it non-stop since I bought it. And I almost never do that.

B00151HZME|4.0|This album has a different shift from Frenchfolk M83's last two albums   Digital Shades and Before the Dawn Heals us; there's no moon   romance in this album, but it still upkeeps the theatrical and   searching sound. The `youth' it attempts is filtered through nostalgia   for the purposefully fake sounds of the '80s,. This album could easily   be classified as fantasy pop music (the vocals occasionally sound sinister).   Sometimes there are obvious musical parallels to people like Phil Collins--but   makes sense with the reminiscent 80s.  Play any of `em. if you flip through   the cd cover, note how each person is divinely beautiful .
B00005JMFQ|5.0|Wonderfully casted and brilliant comedy.  An incredible ensemble of talent seep through every crevice of this production.  Hugh Grant is his normally charming and funny self.  This is a wonderful holiday movie and gift for everyone!!!
B00005JPY0|5.0|This movie is brilliant. I think it far surpassed anybody's expectations of what a comic book movie could be. I really don't know where this franchise can go from here. How can they top this? As far as I'm concerned, this was a perfect Batman movie.<br /><br />And as for Heath Ledger, I really thought that I might be kind of depressed watching this film because of his death. But I wasn't at all because I completely forgot that it was Heath playing the part. He completely transformed himself into the Joker. If he doesn't get nominated and WIN the Oscar for this role, it will be a crime.

B0017U7PT6|2.0|I am a sucker for \\"monsters\\" and beasts in general. Been that since childhood and I'm close to 40 now. So although I already knew about the \\"not so good\\" critics for this movie, I just wanted it to see it because of the pre-historic beasts.    Alas, even they and the nice scenic cannot save this picture. It's just too boring. Acting is bad. And even the beasts were not as good as I hoped to be. The hairy elephants (don't know what they're called in English :) ) were ok. About as nice as the ones in LOTR. But the Sabretooth Tiger was just not realistic enough. And the \\"interaction\\" with it was too far fedged! Come on, this is a wild beast! not some nice little kitten!   Lots of deja vu's as well. Especially from LOTR and Jurassic park. The whole \\"run through high vegetation area while being chased by unknown beasts\\" is just a Jurassic Park rip off.   Anyway, rent it or buy it cheap second hand if you're really \\"into\\" these kind of beasts/monsters/dino's, else just leave it be.

I tried this DVD and then realized that I am NOT really getting that much of a workout at the gym.  The day after my first workout, I was SORE!!!  I found myself sucking wind and taking breaks here and there.    One week later, I can get through the level one workout without stopping.  I am already seeing more progress in my shape than in months at the gym!  My husband has been gone all week and he noticed a big difference.  I'm tempted to cancel my gym membership and use the money I save to buy more of Jillian's DVDs.  She is hardcore, but she really gives you a great workout!  I love that she offers lots of encouragement on the DVD, too.

Yet, almost all of these flaws are made up for by an astonishing performance by Heath Ledger.  When he appears, the screen lights up, figuratively, of course, since most of the film is barely (and poorly) lit.  His is the only character in the film of substance, and the only character worthy of sustaining an audience's attention as the film drags on and on and on.  In Ledger's hands -- and with dialogue that seems too good for the rest of the script, and suggests he might have been responsible for many of his own lines -- the Joker becomes a quasi-supernatural force.  He is a man without a past or future who is truly life's court jester, a trickster whose only driving force is to smash the status quo with a superior intellect, a pointed sense of humor (both literally and figuratively), and a grim visage that seems drawn directly from our collective unconscious.  He is the clown writ large, and he savors every word of his dialogue as his eyes, lips, and tongue dart and flash.<br /><br />In the end, you can't help but like this Joker, side with him, or at least feel comradeship with or sympathy for him.  In contrast, Batman is a wooden cut out, a dour, self-absorbed schmuck in titanium hosiery whose voice becomes a silly, raspy lisp whenever he dons his uniform.
B0014Z4OQG|1.0|Annoying: the entire \\"hand-held camera documentary style filming technique is tired and likely to cause viewers to puke.    Depressing (spoiler alert): they die.  That's it.  The whole movie leads to their death.  Wow.  Hollywood really knows how to make `em.

I should write to you and ask for a refund! I feel as if I threw my money into the toilet! I can't even give the cd away, I've tried. Go away for a couple of years and then try again!

1401300529|5.0|Great book--nested series of bios and accounts of political and military events leading up to and during the Korean War, with some treatment of how Right Wing politics then influenced Kennedy and Johnson Administrations to become involved in Vietnam.  A lot of attention is devoted to the pernicious role of MacArthur, and how he got the country in trouble, and prolonged the war through his personality disorder.  I learned an awful lot and enjoyed the instruction.  All the people I knew as a child whined about how Truman had lost China and how great a man MacArthur was.  Now we know better, but they are all dead.  I kept wondering if anything would have convinced them otherwise, since their beliefs were so ill-founded.  I didn't have any complaints about this book, except it got really painful reading about how disastrous Ned Almond was as a soldier and as a human being.
B00005JLR2|5.0|I am probably one of the few who did see \\"Treasure Planet\\" in the theater. I found it thoroughly enjoyable. I think part of the problem with the poor showing at theaters, was that the movie, overall, was geared more towards teen males and adults (those who usually do not go to a theater to see a cartoon). The one liners in the film that reference other movies/shows like Star Trek and Star Wars are numerous, but you have to catch them. Casting was perfect. If possible, they should re-release the film in Disney 3D as was done with Tim Burton's \\"The Nightmare Before Christmas\\". This would be a prime movie to do that with, unless, due that it is a cartoon, the characters come across as flat. Eventually, I think this will be a Disney Classic.

B00005JKHP|2.0|I am still amazed that there are people who will give this a 5-star rating. When first released the movie had one main attraction: The reunion of the original series crew. Being a huge Star Trek fan I went to see it in the theater three times. But even then, before any other ST films were released it was obvious there were problems. Even when you take in the \\"Director's Cut\\" that has since been released, updating the look and feel of the movie, it still suffers from one major problem: The story sucked! It ended up being nothing more than a rehash of a couple of shows from the original series.<br /><br />Back in 1979 I listened to a radio interview with Walter Koenig after the movie was released and he basically stated that they started off filming with half a script. Because of the tightness of the shooting schedule there were many times they filmed with only an outline for certain scenes. The film feels that way. There are many scenes that seemed contrived, like the actors were winging it. Some of the acting was horrible (Persis Khambata), some of it was bland (Walter Koenig, George Takei), and some of it was just unecessary (Majel Barrett, Grace Lee Whitney). The best acting on the film was turned in by Stephen Collins (future dad on [[ASIN:B000VDDDYQ 7th Heaven - Seasons 1-5]]). His character was interesting. His constant sparring with Admiral Kirk was one of the highlights of the film, giving the picture a great tension within the plot. Leonard Nimoy's portrayal of Spock was OK for this film but lacked originality. At the beginning he's 100% emotionless but by the end of the film he embraces his emotions. This would have been much more interesting had we not seen it 3 - 4 times in the original series.<br /><br />One other problem, there were times that the movie drags. Two scenes in particular: When Scott is taking Kirk over to the Enterprize in a shuttle we're treated to a 10 minute dragging \\"inspection\\" of the ship. Interesting for the first 5 minutes, it gets old quickly. But that pales in comparrison to the scene showing the Enterprize entering the Vger cloud. That seemed to go on forever. The only good thing about it, you had enough time to get up, go to the restroom, then stand in line to buy another box of Bon Bons, and still get back before it was over.<br /><br />Are there things to like here? Absolutely! Jerry Goldsmith's soundtrack was astounding! No wonder TNG stole it. And, again, the reunion of the cast 10 years after the cancellation of the series was fun to watch. But once you got to see [[ASIN:B0000683DH Star Trek II: The Wrath of Khan - The Director's Cut (Two-Disc Special Collector's Edition)]] you really do realize how bad this movie was. Did they improve it when releasing the \\"Director's Cut\\" on DVD? Yes, but only the look and feel of the movie. Even with the extended scenes added, it still ends up towards the bottom of the Star Trek Movie list, just a bit above (maybe) [[ASIN:B0000AUHOH Star Trek V - The Final Frontier (Two-Disc Special Collector's Edition)]].But that pales in comparrison to the scene showing the Enterprize entering the Vger cloud.

B0015519VS|5.0|I REALLY LIKE THIS ALBUM!! He had truly stepped into new territory boldly presenting his music with a maturity, scope and range beyond anything he has achieved before, and driven by a blazing purpose and passion. What Usher ultimately reveals is a depth and integrity that have largely been absent from contemporary R&B. With this album, He invoked such immortal inspirations as Al Green and Marvin Gaye, for the masculinity and adult sensibility of their work. And he thought he was standing at the leading edge of a change in R&B. This album went Platinum.
B0018CWEYY|1.0|This is absolutely NOT a thinking person's notion of stimulating entertainment, If I were you, I would watch the first and last episode and I sware you won't miss a thing. There's just on thing clear here: They wlll be lost forever ok?, so don't waste your time, or the next one to be lost will be you. It is so incredible boring!! and you know the worse? I am not exagerating!!! Try Prison break and your undestanding of great suspense will be changed forever.
0375424474|5.0|Upon reading the preceding, uniformly glowing reviews, I couldn't help but wonder if maybe they were written by friends of the author - this is a book by a fish paleontologist, after all. But even after a few pages, I could understand the enthusiasm. This is a gem of a book. It popularizes science in the best possible sense: making the arcane not only accessible but meaningful to those without specialized knowledge. Its central message is that we all contain within our genes and anatomy a legacy of the entire course of the evolution of life. The author conveys his own sense of wonder at this realization in the conclusion, but until then allows us to gradually experience it ourselves as he brilliantly summarizes the amazing analogies in structure and development between ourselves and even the most seemingly primitive life forms. Without ever sounding a strident note, he demonstrates with overwhelming evidence not only the nature, but inherent elegance and beauty of evolution.  With its concise chapters and breezy prose (including the occasional pun inserted with geeky delight: a dental vestige is an \\"inconvenient tooth\\"), this small volume magnifies the impact of its message by being a pleasure to read.
1416523359|1.0|This is the worst King book I have ever read.  The first part of this book to irritate me was the entire section devoted to describing the discomfort of Lisey's underwear.  It was so overdone that instead of making the scene seem more \\"real\\" it drew my attention away from the story and made me wonder if King was perhaps trying too hard to capture the female voice.  As I continued to read King continued to irritate me.  All of the made up words became nauseating. So did the references to sex.  I believe the reason I was so sickened by these passages was the combination of the cutesy factor coupled with the out of nowhere sex bits.  It sort of gave me the uncomfortable feeling one gets if they imagine a middle aged couple making out heavily in public while baby talking each other.  That aside, for every event to occur I had to wade through a ton of boring memories and internal dialogue.  Then there was the character of Lisey herself who was duller than dull.  I have the feeling that if I met Lisey in real life I would detest her, though it is hard to picture her in real life since she just seemed to lack some essential characteristics.  She was more like something a man imagining a woman would create and less like a real woman.  I have tried to figure out why Lisey comes across as such a one dimensional character used as a back drop to display the gem of her husband and I believe it is because everything she thinks or does contains a reference to him or a reaction to something he has said or says, has done or is doing.  Despite the fact that she does some pretty feisty things she doesn't come across as feisty only as a slightly dimwitted woman who does what circumstances require while constantly putting herself down.  King fails to flesh out his character and the result is that I didn't care what happened to her.  I also found it irritating that King at the end of the book attempts to defend his editor by basically saying that any editor of an author who writes a lotof books is apt to be criticized for not editing enough and proclaims that his editor actually did do a lot of editing.  While I suppose trying to defend his editor is admirable it would do King well instead of getting so defensive to consider that maybe the reason why so many of his books receive this criticism is because there is some merit in it and perhaps (gasp) adjust his own writing style accordingly.
B000002UB3|5.0|So I was just idly surfing Amazon, reading reviews and whatnot when I decided to search the Beatles' catalogue. Abbey Road is the first you get when you punch the group's name in. The reviews, naturally this being the most popular band ever, were mostly positive. Positive reviews tend to bore me, so I decided to look at the negative (1 star) reviews instead, just for a laugh. But the thing is I've always been a bit insecure about my love of the Beatles. There is always a voice in me questioning \\"what if it is all hype? What if there's really nothing spectacular about them and you're just following along with the rock critics and fans?\\". Some of the 1 star reviews brought these feelings back as I tried to recollect what this album sounded like. It really didn't seem spectacular at all. The songwriting seemed superficial and the instrumentation seemed mediocre. Logic forbade me to continue to praise them.        So then I put the boys to the test and grabbed this album and gave it a listen (I'm listening to it now actually), and all I can say is, well, I like it. Alot. There is a certain charm in the melodies and lyrics, often times playful but somehow epic, even meaningful in an insane way. The Beatles inhabit a pop music dreamland on this album. Everything sounds perfectly placed, all the parts nuanced. It always sounds oh so cheesy when I think of it afterwards, but when I've got a Beatles album on, I am inside it and I am happy. A cheerful trance of sorts.           I'm sure once this album is over and a few days have passed I will again wonder why I let the Beatles fill space in my CD collection. I may even regret writing this review, or this 5 star rating, then I'll listen to them again.
B000002IG4|4.0|I originially bought the CD for the single,\\"I don't care, anymore,\\" and to see what else he might have created.While hooked on the lead song, I am now also hooked on the entire CD,being continually amazed that a drummer could create all that he does.
015603283X|4.0|I wish the literary references weren't constantly beyond me, because I really liked this book, but I did feel it would have helped to bone up on Dumas and The Three Musketeers in advance.  However, if you like books, and mysteries, with a bit of occult (perhaps conjuring up Satan himself), this book will keep you interested to the very last page.
B0016A2FFG|5.0|After all these years, the Reverend Al Green has returned to his roots. He has rediscovered the   R 'n' B style that made him so famous in the 1970's. This is his third attempt during the past   5 years, and this time he nails it. Great performance, masterful production and a great   list of songs that will take you back 30 years. The production is flawless allowing Green to do what he does best, sing the ballads. The mixture of the horn section along with the base lines   reestablishes Green as one of the truly great soul singers. Every song beckons the  listener to a sexy, soulful flavor.  Standouts are the title track, Just For Me,  Take Your Time and All I Need.Any Green fan would do well in purchasing this return to the classic Al Green. Great CD.
B001ACY8D2|4.0|A change of direction? yes and no.. is it better than the albums they made prior to takk...? No.. but better than takk? in my opinion, it very well is.  Sigur Ros is one of those bands you try to get.. or a band you don't get at all... you see, because Sigur Ros is so hard to \\"get\\"  if you get what I am saying.  with this album, Sigur Ros Does not Delve into Sonic experiments as much as their entire discography but that can be a change for the good. When Takk... tried too hard to be accessible, this one does it much more flawlessly.. so in terms it seems Sigur Ros Is comfy with not being the Experimental band of Ágætis byrjun but a more Built up, More Organic, Visceral to say sort of band.    Pros: An Improvement over their last album,  Very Beautiful as is all of sigur Ros's music.  Very Reflective, Sexy (Yea this is good sex music) and Dramatic. If you are already a big fan of them you will be satisfied with what this Record Offers. More Human and emotional imo than anything Sigur Ros has came out with. And If you are not a big fan of walls of sound and Merging instruments, you might Like this album more than previous efforts, for you can pick out the instruments being played.    Cons: Trys too hard to please everyone, and by that I mean it seems Sigur Ros trys gaining new fans while at the same time trying to please old fans, trying hard to be more accessible.. which is a whip lash in the Indie world (being reviewed by Rolling stone is a double whip lash) sometimes the record seems too short, when alot of songs don't take off when you expect it and when they do take off the results are not as inspiring as one would expect such as the song \\"Festival\\".  One more... if you already hated Sigur Ros, you will still hate the Sigur.    Overall, I think this album is deserving of praise, A good effort, A good change of direction from Them,  but it is not nearly their masterpiece.
B001AQWC2C|5.0|If people want candy coated dog barf, go pick up some of the overdubbed sampled to death crap the youth of today call music.<br /><br />But here we are many years after the Beast was Unleashed, loud and as powerful as ever.  For those who knew this was coming I hope you weren't expecting a Judas Priest version of something like Tommy!  This is so much more than that, it has a message all can understand.  And if you have trouble the music will certainly help you.<br /><br />This isn't for the faint of heart it is still 100% Judas Priest, with the powerful riffs of the Dowling and Tipton etc but the Vocals of Rob Halford is superb.<br /><br />Visions, Alone and Revelations get repeated the most as these are a little darker than most - in the same category as Touch of Evil was.
B00005JPXY|1.0|I've never been so angry about such an overrated and overhyped movie as Cloverfield.  First 20 minutes NOTHING happens.  I was so bored I could scream.  The rest of this poor excuse for a movie was dull, dull, dull.  Totally forgettable noname actors, no excitement, almost no dialog, no explanation for anything.  The ending was the icing on this awful cake.  Nothing happens in the ending either.  Even the title is dull, as it makes no sense.    All those involved in making this film should be blacklisted by the studios from ever getting funding for future films.
038073186X|4.0|I solved the anagram on page 205 and from that I predicted the entire last half of the story. LeHane should have hidden such a revelatory clue a little better. It is like a major spoiler right in the middle of the story, making the last half a bit of a chore instead of the breathless progression it was intended to be. The finale still stung my heart, but if I had learned the twists when they were properly revealed, I would have called this story a masterpiece.
B000XYNFD2|4.0|The  Invicta 9937 is a great watch for the price. You get a swiss automatic movement with perpetual motion (no ticking). Love everything about the watch except for the glow in the dark feature. After it gets dark, the green spots don't show for more then an hour and then goes dark. However,  the watch looks great and for the price, you can't beat it (unless you get the Rolex :).
B0017I1FO4|5.0|Shinedown is a really good and versatile band.  Each of their CDs have gotten better and better.  This one is well worth buying.  I only bought it for \\"Devour\\", however, each song, as usual, was well written and performed.
B000E0LB8G|5.0|This is one of my favorite sets of the Beethoven Concertos, on any types of instruments.  It is beautifully recorded.  Lubin uses three different fortepianos to reflect the differing instruments from the periods when the concertos were premiered.  He even uses his own cadenza in No. 1, because the one Beethoven supplied was from years later, and Lubin deemed it inappropriate for the pianoforte of the concerto's time.  All of the fortepianos have interesting sounds, more so than the one instrument Melvyn Tan used on his set.  The fortepiano on the first two concertos has a very light, sort of twangy sonority, but it still can create real drama and is allowed by the composer to cut through his orchestration.  In the entire set, much of the keyboard expression that a modern instrument would accomplish through power and a saturated tone instead is accomplished with a sensitivity to articulation and the play of light and shade.  There is no shortage of drama anywhere in these performances.  Hogwood's accompaniments are among the best I've ever heard, easily in the same league as Bernard Haitink's for Perahia and George Szell's for Fleisher.  I also feel that the soloists, especially the first horn, show more individuality than do Norrington's London Classical Players. The sonatas are a welcome addition, if not quite at the adrenaline level of the conceros, with the exception of The Tempest.  This set is a vital addition to anyone's collection of Beethoven Concertos.
B00136JS12|5.0|This album is the standard by which all recorded music will be measured. This is flawless.
B00011F5DK|4.0|Played this with my family and we enjoyed it.  Very easy to learn\teach, but tricky to build strategy with.  Made the young ones think.  Very engaging game.<br /><br />While far from fragile, I thought the pieces could be snapped in the wrong hands.  However, I don't know if this is something that can be remedied at manufacture.  My advice?  Keep it away from the toddlers.
B00004Y6OA|5.0|Although I had heard some of Women and Children First at a friend's house, I didn't really get into it until after I heard And the Cradle Will Rock on the radio.  Then I had to buy the album and listened to it again, and again and again.  Most VH fans I'm sure similarly wore out their turntables (not to mention enraging their parents and neighbors since of course the volume had to be turned all the way up).  Now I have everything on CD and this disc, along with Fair Warning, get played more than the other DLR-era albums.    From a broadcast of Off the Record with Mary Turner I remember Roth joked that Eddie sleeps with his stratocaster.  I think this album, more than any other, demonstrates what he was getting at, in terms of Eddie's familiarity with the instrument.  The virtuosity of Eddie's playing is superlative.  Although maybe performing a solo like Eruption is harder technically, here he has a kind of spontaneity that has never been replicated.  Indeed I believe the entire album was recorded in about two weeks.    (As I recall there were two interviews conducted by Mary Turner for Westwood One (circa 1980-81).  One was with Roth and Alex, the other with Eddie.  Eddie was modest and unpretentious, even a little shy; Roth was Roth.  Just polar opposites.)    My favorite song on this record is Fools.
B0000TB01Y|5.0|When me and my family were visiting USA a couple of weeks ago we saw this musical. It was actually my first musical I'd ever seen. It blew me away. The day after the show we went to a CD store and bought this soundtrack to bring home so we all could have something to remember it by. I can't stop listening to it.    First of all, the perfomances (especially the two lead female vocalists together) are amazing. They bring so much emotion to their songs so it's impossible not to sing along. And the songs themselves are incredibly well written and arranged. In my opinion, especially the song \\"Defying Gravity\\" stands out. All the songs are worth their five stars, but this song is worth seven.    A good thing is that in the following booklet, you can follow the lyrics.
B0000C9JFO|5.0|Good idea, good direction, good cast, lots of fun, brings up real life issues and leaves you fulfilled.    For those of you not familiar with Romain Duris yet, I also recommend seeing The Beat that My Heart Skipped. I think he has what it takes, and is one of the best actors today.
B0016AJU2C|5.0|Really love this CD.  8/11 songs on CD 1 I really like.  2/5 on CD 2 I like so I would say the 2 disc isn't a must, but definitely get the CD.  Its a great new sound for her and I enjoy listening to this one over and over.  I haven't bought a CD in years just downloading an occasional song off of iTunes, but this CD was worth purchasing.    I think people who are giving this album negatives are just missing the negative angsty lyrics from Jagged Little Pill.  You can't repeat Jagged Little Pill.  It's obviously what shot her into stardom, but give the girl a break and really take the time to enjoy by far one of the best albums that will hit shelves this year. It's new and different and a refreshing change that is bonused by Alanis' amazing unique voice.

B0018QCXGY|4.0|I really enjoyed this movie.  A very suspenseful story with solid acting. The hand held camera aspect kept me on the edge of my seat.  It may not be for everyone, but if you're open to a different take on the classic \\"Godzilla\\" genre, you may enjoy this pic.
0385338082|4.0|A delightful book, very entertaining. Can You Keep a Secret? was my book club's July selection, and although we didn't have a lot of \\"meaty\\" material to discuss, we had lots of fun talking about what constitutes a secret and whether there are occasions when secrets are not only appropriate but also downright necessary. Before the evening was over, some people shared secrets, and we all agreed that we could easily identify with Emma Corrigan.<br /><br />Although the novel was funny and entertaining, there are bits of it with which everyone can identify. Who hasn't felt a bit of annoyance with boastful relatives, the joy of love and attraction, and the frustration of a job that seems to be going nowhere? The difference between us and Emma is that we don't tell all of our secrets to strangers on an airplane and then later end up in close proximity to the stranger...as in \\"boss\\" and later, friend and lover.<br /><br />The dialogue was great as were some of the scenes. Kinsella does a fantastic job of creating amusing and sometimes exciting, tense scenes. I laughed aloud at the picnic scene and Kerry's discomfiture, and I found myself tensing up when Jemima brought the journalist to get the \\"real scoop\\" on Jack.  In other words, this was a fun book that most gals will enjoy.
B0000041WV|5.0|Well since I order this from amazon.com, I<br />have listen to the whole cycle of symphonies<br />several times, and what really cought my attention<br />was his early symphonies, in particular the<br />story behind the first symphony which I<br />will not tell you so you can read it in the<br />detailed liner notes of the CD. I don't think<br />that I have a particular symphony by Dvorak, I<br />like, but rather I say that I like them all equally.<br />At the amazon.com price this is really a bargain,<br />highly recommended music for all ages and walks of<br />life. Kertesz and the Brits did a fantastic work.
B000UBMWG4|5.0|This is a great example of value for dollar in the Blu-Ray camp. Picture quality is tremendous and the supplemental material (and multiple VERSIONS OF THE FILM) make this a must-have for any Blade Runner fan and answers virtually any question you might have had about the production, and then some you wouldn't have thought to ask. Very interesting segment on how they did some enhancements to fix certain things about the original film (worthwhile and justified fixes). If you really want to show off the improvement in picture quality, just pop in your old DVD and you'll see a HUGE difference. Highly recommended.
B0019FOC5E|5.0|I have not seen the stage version or the movie yet, but I saw the trailer, listened to some samples, read a bit, and bought the CD.  I loved every minute of it!  All of the actors were great singers.    Meryl Streep was a HUGE surprise.  She completely blew me away with her OUTSTANDING vocal skills.    Amanda Seyfried is inspired and great.  What else can you say?  It seems like she puts no effort into her songs.  Her voice must be just naturally beautiful.    Colin Firth and Stellan Skasgaard did well on OUR LAST SUMMER.    Julie Walters is great on TAKE A CHANCE ON ME, and Christine Baranski was (surprisingly) wonderful on DOES YOUR MOTHER KNOW (what a fun song!)    Now comes the big controversy.  Pierce Brosnan.  Almost every review I've read critisizes Pierce and his singing.  Well, I'm not a Pierce basher.  Though it's apparent that he isn't a professional singer, he does an exceptional job in his three songs: OUR LAST SUMMER, S.O.S., and WHEN ALL IS SAID AND DONE.  He can carry a pitch and tune very well.    This music had be singing along within seconds.  I'm sure I'll be tempted to sing and dance in the theatre aisles when I see the movie.  I can't wait.
B00000AFFF|5.0|With a reputation so rooted in the nicotine-infused lounge lizardry of Hal David, Dionne Warwick and the zero consequence hedonism of Southern California affluence - the prospect of a Burt Bacharach tag-team with the much rougher and far more tumbled Elvis Costello would have seemed to be an Irwin Allen disaster in waiting - a wildly ironic vanity project with all the nervous energy and awkward body language of an arranged marriage.    Well, a strange thing happened on the way to that opposites don't attract scenario - Bacharach and Costello made a remarkable record that after a decade of repeated listening has only become more vibrant and powerful. The vastly different approach of both artists makes little difference - whether it is the caramelized melodies of Mr. Bacharach or the sly, vindictiveness of Costello's wordplay their view of relationships has always been essentially the same - love is a brutal enterprise and a harsh taskmaster.    Painted From Memory is sex music for couples with issues - serene and beautiful with innuendo and invective bubbling just beneath the surface. All of the compositions are masterful with \\"Toledo\\", \\"My Thief\\" and \\"What's Her Name Today?\\" particularly haunting. Painted From Memory is a permanent resident on my very short list of Desert Island Discs.

The actual facts are that this is a reworked version of the album version that Lennon tried to get as the B side of Hey Jude...the other Beatles felt the album version was too slow. Actually both versions are stellar.
B00005JPY0|5.0|This movie was really good. I didn't like the first batman but this one really made up for what the original was lacking. The biggest improvement was with the addition of the joker and the great job that Heath Ledger did playing the role. Even though I still think Jack Nicholson has a slight edge on him, Heath ledger put up a classic performance. The movie is well written, is packed with action and is enjoyable from beginning to end. I am a big comic fan so I love how the movie stayed true to the relationship between Batman /Joker, and how one can't do without the other in Gotham. Also being a chicago native, I thought it was great to see the many shots of Chi-town as batman fought with his villains. Bottom line treat yourself, don't cheat yourself.......Go see this movie.
B000K4UF4C|5.0|When Rachmaninoff premiered his Third Concerto, it was generally assumed that few others would play it. But along came  Horowitz who virtually  made it his theme song. Today, there are some 120 available recordings of this work, confirming that every conservatory prodigy now includes it in his repertoire. I have searched decades for a performance that I consider totally satisfactory and own performances by Horowitz (3), Rachmaninoff, Gieseking, Weissenberg, Argerich, Anievas, Ashkenasy, Lugansky, Gutierrez, Hough, Wild, and Cliburn, but not until I auditioned the Volodos/Levine/Berlin Philharmonic performance did I finally end my search. For me, this is a totally satisfying performance. It recalls the performances of the great Dinu Lipatti in which one hears no technique, but only  music. The tone is lyrical, the interpretation poetic, the conception grand, the technique flawless, the tempi perfect, the piano/orchestra balance  superb, and the ensemble flawless. The only word that adequately describes this performance is \\"transcendental.\\"  Levine's collaboration is as sensitive as his best Metropolitan Opera performances and the playing of the Berlin Philharmonic  is incomparable. As if the Concerto isn't enough, there are six shorter Rachmaninoff pieces included to fill out the disk, my favorite of which is the Volodos transcription of the Andante from the Rachmaninoff Cello Sonata in  G. Volodos plays these works with a beauty and musical comprehension that elevate them beyond the human, to the sublime. You won't be disappointed  with this disk which sells at a bargain price.<br /><br />Eugene Thamon Simpson<br />Sicklerville, New Jersey

This book became my guide to a place that allowed me to tie together everything in my life and brought me to peace at a time of huge turmoil and really for the first time in my life. My spiritual beliefs also were brought into focus and made stronger. I have purchased copies of this book for some of my friends who were on their way to enlightenment and they too are finding a way peace that they have never had. You won't be sorry for the time you spend with this book.

It surely will be a joy for those capable of opening up to Kafka's complex existential world. It is said that Kafka laughed obstreperously while reading this book. I tried to laugh along with him, but I believe there are a myriad of other approaches to this novella that are just as appropriate. I recommend to all.

B00005JPY0|5.0|WOW WOW WOW WOW!!! This is the way a Batman movie should be and should look like. This is how the JOKER should act, show his personality, and show the wackiness within. All the elements of the batman comics came to life and went beyond the comics themselves with such strong emotion. Heath Ledger turned the wacky veiw we had of the Joker and re-invented it with such strong acting that he set the bar for any future actors as to how to play the Joker.     First Off lets start with the Heath Ledgers contribution to this character. Whatever this man did to prepare for his part worked. Im pretty sure Nolan wanted the Joker in a more serious, insane, yet funny manner for this movie. Nolan's push for a darker batman worked and Ledger gave Nolan what he was looking for. A Joker with eyes that show NO empathy, show Schizophrenia, Show Psychopath, and with a smile to show aggravation and laughter at the same time. Ledgers laughters, stares, anger, and Looney bin looks gave a chill down my spine at times. This Joker is no prankster, this a murderous prankster who is willing to kill in a slow, painful, and sadistic way....just to test the limits of human beings. The Joker wanted to prove that he wasnt a common criminal, that Batsy was not invincible, that Human Beings and their Fantasy with Control can be thrown into Chaos, and that when it comes down to it you could bring any human being to kill. As you progress through the movie you see Joker's facination with Batmans serious demeanor, he pushes his buttons just like the comics to see if Batman can crack and kill him....to see if he can crack a smile. He proves to theatre goers that he can put a city into chaos by breaking down the rules we create. He Proves that Batman is just human and that no fear can be gained out of Batman. I think Nolan wanted to take the whole FEAR thing that Batman represented and say, \\"Here is this Clown with No Fear for you, He wants to challenge the preconcieved notion that gothams underworld had for you!\\" The Lack of Fear for Batman and the ongoing battle these 2 will face for the rest of their lives is evident in the \\"interrogation scene\\". No Matter How many times Batsy pummeled his face, the joker could have cared less and continued to push his buttons......and continued to maintain emotional control of those around him. The Script is incredible but its Ledgers facial expressions, shrill voice, maniacal laughter and bottomless stare that enhances this movie so much.    Batman, the total opposite of the maniac....Composed, thinking, morality as his number 1, a symbol of fear for all of gothams underworld. Christian Bale has all but become a supporting actor along with everyone else. Batman has grown weary and battle scars are flaring all over his body. Nolan's point was to show that Batman is not invincible...that his hardwork of protecting gotham is evident in his scaring, his performance at work is lacking, and most of all his psyche is taking a toll. In comes Joker and he pushes batman to his limits, he causes batman to be on his toes at all times during this movie, Bale does so well in conveying the frustration in his character because a monster is in front of him that knows no bounds, and shows no fear. Bale's acting is top notch for this movie but one little gripe is evident, he forces his voice to be raspy as if his suit is squeezing his nuts to oblivion....    In general this was the best Batman Movie to be ever released....This sets the tone for Batman's Future Theatrical Releases, sets the tone for the Villains to be portrayed in a dark and twisted manner...and sets the bar very high for the next person to step into the Joker's Suit, if ever, and act with a maniacal mindset    RIP...to Heath Ledger and his brilliant acting

B00005JPY0|5.0|It's nice to know that a film with such high expectations has finally met them.  It's record-breaking box office sales certainly do serve to highlight this very thing, having raked in $66.4 million on its opening day and accruing a whopping total of $155 million its opening weekend, breaking both records set by 2007's \\"Spider-Man 3\\".  With five scenes filmed with IMAX cameras, the untimely death of one of its lead actors and talk of the film being THE summer blockbuster of 2008, it makes one want to buy that extra-large tub of popcorn because it's worth the experience.<br /><br />And experience it you will.  \\"The Dark Knight\\" has set a new precedent for comic book movies and fan boys everywhere will be gushing praise for Christopher Nolan's artsy and dignified portrayal of one of the oldest and most classic hero-villain combos of all time.<br /><br />The movie kicks off with, appropriately enough, a bank heist, Nolan gearing his audience up for the ride of their lives.  The perps are donning ghoulish clown masks as they spray gunfire about the building and load up cash from the vault.  As they scramble to make their getaway, one by one they systematically kill each other, their group impregnated with a sinister paranoia.  Ultimately there is just one left standing at the end of it all and he makes a grand exit in a school bus, disappearing into the traffic-riddled metropolis whilst law enforcement arrives moments too late.<br /><br />Meanwhile, under the assumption that Gotham's most serious threats are now subdued and/or gone (Ra Al Ghul and the Scarecrow from \\"Batman Begins\\"), Batman seeks to share the load by joining forces with Lt. Jim Gordon (Oldman) and District Attorney Harvey Dent (Eckhart), the man whom Bruce Wayne would most like to appoint as Gotham's new and legitimate savior.  Gordon's and Dent's staunch approach to upholding the law is just what the city needs in order to dismantle its organized crime, but their dynamic triumvirate proves to be no match for the machinations of a criminal mastermind known only to the public as The Joker.  In the instant that the Joker appears, he makes his demands known to the criminal underworld and then proceeds to swoop in and take what he wants by force, despite their refusal to collaborate.  Unlike the parasitic monsters that had plagued Gotham in the past, The Joker is after a much bigger prize: the capitulation of Batman and the subsequent surrender of Gotham's citizens to his inconstant wiles.  In his fight to stop him, Batman will come face to face with good and evil and in the end has to choose between maintaining the delicate equilibrium of Gotham or romancing the unattainable.<br /><br />Director Christopher Nolan (who co-wrote the script with his brother Jonathan, the man responsible for the story behind 2000's \\"Memento\\") strayed from Burton's gothic surrealism and instead created a brooding and subdued metropolis in the previous film (Batman Begins); he continues this sultry but perilous landscape in \\"The Dark Knight\\" and this is the feel that \\"Batman\\" was meant to have all along.  An original score by James Newton Howard (The Sixth Sense) and Hans Zimmer (Gladiator) breathes even more life into the enthralling action, and with Wally Pfister's superb cinematography and effective editing from Lee Smith, Nolan and crew have created a perfectly-paced, heart-stopping thriller that will have you completely oblivious to its 2 hour and 30 minute time frame.<br /><br />Christian Bale is the best of the caped crusaders yet, his personification of Bruce Wayne the enigmatic and somber soul that has always been portrayed within the pages of DC Comics.  Where Burton never dared to venture, Nolan has Bruce Wayne savoring his elite businessman lifestyle by cavorting around with beautiful women (at one point, Wayne is aboard a yacht with the entire female entourage of the Russian ballet).  I'm sorry to say however that Bale, despite being a great actor, is overshadowed not only by Ledger's spectacular turn as the Joker but also all the mystic buzz that Ledger's death inspired.  Despite it all, he gives Batman/Bruce Wayne grace and dignity, along with an emotional wound that serves to once again spur his waning battle against terror.<br /><br />Maggie Gyllenhaal, as said by many critics, is an improvement over the bland Katie Holmes (though I'm sure some would've loved to see Holmes sitting in the proverbial \\"hot seat\\" near the end of the film); she shows a bit more spunk and tenacity and the chemistry between herself and Bale is certainly more believable.  Caine is dignified and sentimental as Alfred (the best Alfred yet) and Morgan Freeman gives another stately performance as Lucius Fox, Batman's highly skilled supplier of all his \\"wonderful toys\\".<br /><br />Who really gets a chance to show some diabolical skills is Aaron Eckhart as Harvey Dent, the man who would ultimately become Two-Face.  Eckhart's make-up job combined with additional CGI is grotesque and awesome in all its glory, combined with a spellbinding portrayal of a man who becomes as cold-blooded as the psychotic who disfigured him.  Credit must also be given for a superb and subtle Gary Oldman as Jim Gordon, the man who would be Gotham's future Commissioner.<br /><br />Though Jack Nicholson was a real hoot as the Joker in Tim Burton's 1989 adaptation, 28-year-old Ledger blows him off the map with an exceedingly strange, devilish and frightening portrayal of madness personified.  This Joker is not someone to be trifled with - his \\"magic trick\\" involving a pencil will induce shock and disgust, and this is in only the first thirty seconds that he is introduced face-to-face with the audience.  Upon further introduction, none will be able to turn their eye from the haphazardly applied make-up which only serves to highlight his disfigurement rather than conceal it, the nasally and freakish intonations, the queer lip-licking and the unpredictability of his reflexive malice.<br /><br />Heather Ledger is, quite simply, marvelous.<br /><br />This will no doubt earn him a posthumous nomination for Best Actor come 2009's Oscars, possibly even a posthumous win (co-star Michael Caine has made a similar statement).  That makes watching Ledger cause his audience to shiver that much more bittersweet - it evokes the same \\"what might've been\\" sadness that River Phoenix, another young promising talent, did with fans when he died suddenly from a drug overdose on Halloween in 1993.  I didn't want the movie to end because I knew that there would never be a reprise from this actor so young yet so adept at his craft, let alone a repeat performance of the maniacal Joker in a potential sequel.<br /><br />Bottom Line: A tour-de-force on all levels.  Though you be an action fan, a comic book nerd, a movie-goer or simply a fan of the many talented actors and actresses within \\"The Dark Knight\\", all elements of the film will have you lying in wait eagerly for a sequel.

B0011N1WE8|4.0|Considering she played a white-trash nymphomaniac chained to a radiator in the last film I saw with her, [[ASIN:B000PY52EU Black Snake Moan]], I was actually relieved to see Christina Ricci play a sheltered girl of standing born with a pig's snout in this whimsical 2008 parable about self-acceptance. Directed by first-timer Mark Palansky and written by sitcom veteran Leslie Caveney ([[ASIN:B000UR9TKK Everybody Loves Raymond]]), the film was shelved for over a year until it was released in February to mostly apathetic reviews. That's a shame since there is a certain charm generated by the fractured fairy tale being told. Palansky shows a surprisingly light touch for someone who has apprenticed under the aegis of Michael Bay on bombastic schlock like [[ASIN:B00003CXTG Pearl Harbor]] and [[ASIN:B00000G3PA Armageddon]], but Caveney's screenplay frequently comes across as plodding and repetitive when the story should feel beguiling. Still, it somehow saves itself by the end thanks primarily to a game cast.<br /><br />The plot follows the sad tale of Penelope Wilhern, an heiress subject to a multi-generational curse when her 19th-century ancestors refused to allow one of their own to marry a servant girl. As the first girl born in the family since that injustice, Penelope is burdened with a pig's snout and can return to normalcy when a fellow aristocrat vows to love her for life. Her obsessive, superficial mother Jessica hides Penelope away in the mansion, even faking her death when a tabloid photographer threatens to take a picture. As Penelope comes of age, Jessica uses a professional matchmaker to line up potential suitors, but they all jump out the window when they see Penelope's supposedly hideous face. One particular aristocrat goes public with what his sighting of Penelope, but of course, there is another candidate, a disheveled, gambling jazz pianist named Max, who does fall in love with her. I was wondering why producer Reese Witherspoon didn't cast herself in the title role given her box office clout, but Ricci is the more suitable choice with her otherworldly stares and naturally pouty manner.<br /><br />The problem is that Ricci (beyond not being a proven bankable draw) looks like she has intentionally applied prosthetic makeup to herself. Rather than looking grotesque, she just looks cartoonishly cute. Witherspoon does cast herself but in a small role as Annie, a Vespa-riding messenger who is Gregory Peck to Ricci's Audrey Hepburn on Penelope's [[ASIN:B00003CXCD Roman Holiday]]-style adventure. Witherspoon hasn't been this relaxed and likable since she became a star. As Max, the omnipresent James McAvoy (who seems to be suffering from the same level of overexposure Jude Law did a few years back) is more in his element here than as the smitten, heroic soldier in [[ASIN:B0013XZ6X4 Atonement]]. In what feels like a nod to her role as the panicked mother in [[ASIN:B00008N6NQ Home Alone]], the redoubtable Catherine O'Hara generates most of the laughs as Jessica, but her constant shrieking gets repetitive. Peter Dinklage has a few nicely sinister moments as the tabloid photographer. The eclectic soundtrack is highlighted by the Sigur Ros' [[ASIN:B000BUYTPG Hopp&iacute;polla]]. The only significant extra on the 2008 DVD is a disposable six-minute making-of featurette.role given her box office clout, but Ricci is the more suitable choice with her otherworldly stares and naturally pouty manner.

B00000JCOV|5.0|1st off, Why are people sayin that this is \\"Death Metal\\" ?  Seriously, this ISNT!!!  Anywayz, This CD is really good, thats if, you havent heard it in a LONG time or if you havent heard it at all.  Yeh, the screaming kinda gets annoying, but if your use to it, then, hey, wth, right ?  My personal opinion is, IF you like slipknot ALOT, then go for it.  BUT if you're just getting into them, then, I recommend their 2nd album Iowa.   Anywayz, I personally would put this in the \\"kiddie Metal\\" genre.  Because everyone knowz, therez MORE bands that are heavier.  But yeh, thats my review.
1400031001|5.0|Written in diary form, this novel describes the life and times of Logan Gonzago Mountstuart, born in 1906 in Montevideo to an English father and his Uruguayan wife, who later moves with his family to England just before the First World War, and takes the reader from the 1920s to the 1990s.<br /><br />This is an incredible, thoroughly engaging novel which gives the reader entree into the ups and downs, the fullness of a man's life who travelled widely and knew many of the literary, social and artistic notables of the century (e.g. Picasso, Virginia Wolff, Hemingway, and Jackson Pollack). I enjoyed this book so much I almost hated for it to end!

B0014KD46W|3.0|I have to say I am disappointed with \\"Nine Lives\\", Steve Winwood's new release. Being a bass player I don't understand the lack of electric bass on the record. Most of the songs rely on Winwoods keyboard bass support and don't have the weight or feel that a bassist can provide. Also the drum beats are similar and feature too much percussion (congas and such) and not a strong trap set. The  songs suffer from the lack of a traditional rhythm section. Steve's voice is fine and he looks from the photo to have aged well. The addition of Eric Clapton on one tune helps, but most of the songs just don't go anywhere, and lack the sound of a real band playing together. Buy the \\"Crossroads\\" concert with Steve and Eric and others live, unless you are a die hard Winwood Fan. clench
B0017ZB8M6|3.0|It is strange how people tend to consider the word \\"pop\\" almost like saying a four-letter word in class while some fans applaud bands taking 10 minute songs filled with ever-shifting tempos and changes. While I will admit some bands/artists seem a bit too calculated and image-handled, sometimes you just know a good pop tune when you hear one. While Katy Perry's debut can be easily criticized for having hitmaker songwriters and producers and an overall \\"sheen\\" to it, the songs themselves are incredibly hooky and despite minor gripes, a good pop tune is a good pop tune, no matter who wrote it.    One of the Boys: While the album opener and the title track would seem enough to suggest this song would be awesome, it's only decent. The chorus is alright but nothing special and the music is kind of standard. Kind of disappointing. 6.5/10    I Kissed a Girl: A lot of newcomers tend to have that one song that gets everyone's attention and this track, with shades of Gary Glitter beats, lesbian experimentation lyrics and dance-y vibes, it's one of those songs where it's memorable but then you kind of overplay the thing. 7.5/10    Waking Up in Vegas: Probably tied for my favorite song on the record. Reminds me of Michelle Branch's \\"Breathe\\" which was sort of a great pop tune for people who aren't into pop starlets. The verses work well enough but then the chorus hits and will get stuck in your head. I'd be surprised if this wasn't a single. 9/10    Thinking of You: I have a feeling this will be a single since there is always gotta be that big ballad. It's a well enough song and I find myself not skipping it when I listen to the cd but there's something a little uninspired about it, Ballad 101 if you will. 7.5/10    Mannequin: Third favorite song and of course the first thing that will hit you is Katy's vocals which are quite passionate and \\"big\\" sounding with the music have the appropriate feel. Some might find it gets old or even annoying but I always liked it from when I heard it. 8/10    Ur So Gay: Another of the more well-known tracks but strangely I just don't care for it. Lyrically the record isn't exactly stellar but \\"you're so gay and you don't even like boys\\" is kind of unfortunate and it's a strange track musically as well. Odd piano chords, whistling out of a Western and horns, it's just...out there. 6/10    Hot N Cold: The other favorite off the record. Dance pop tune and while again, lyrically it's simple to a fault but that chorus is incredibly catchy and the rest of the song is enjoyable as well. Should definitely be a single and a cd highlight as well. 9/10    If You Can Afford Me: Enjoyable but potentially forgettable pop ditty and while I quite like the solo in its Cure-ness, the track as a whole is listenable but after awhile it just sort of fades until you re-listen again. 6.5/10    Lost: Another ballad though I like it a bit more than Thinking of You, mainly for Katy's vocals and the music in the background with synth, higher bell notes and acoustic guitars. And I quite like the vocal melodies that shows up at the bridge and the end. But again it might be too Ballad 101 for some...not that the record as a whole isn't immune to criticisms, mind you. 8/10    Self Inflicted: A bit more hard rocking than most of the tracks on the cd and reminds me of a better version of If You Can Afford Me. The chorus is fairly catchy and this weird vocal melody before one of the choruses is quite catchy. Slightly forgettable but still at least worth a listen. 7.5/10    I'm Still Breathing: Back to ballad mode and it's not as good as Lost is to me. Musically I guess it's well done and Katy's vocals are fairly good but the song as a whole is unmemorable for the most part and it's just decent. 6.5/10    Fingerprints: Picks up the pace and ends the record on a rocking note and it's pretty well done though it's not really Vegas or Hot N Cold-caliber though I quite enjoyed it anyway. The album has been hit-or-miss and thankfully the album atleast ends on a good one. 8/10    The record is one of those kind that has some songs to back up the attention that she's been getting but then on the other hand pitfalls like lyrics and a similarity to other artists musically or in the vocals can vastly prevent someone from liking it. So in the end, it's kind of generic but didn't stop me from singing it afterwards.

B000VHOF8K|5.0|Every word in all these reviews about Marvin's soul and artistry is 100% correct  There's another reason to own this fantastic collection and that is the presence of the honorable James Jamerson on the electric bass.  His beautiful lines, touch and deep tone are still unequaled to this day.  Unlike so many bassists who climb to the high notes for notice, Jamerson always found the deep notes that would grab you in the heart. To be able to hear James recreate the fantastic work he did on What's Going On  live in concert is priceless to any one who loves his playing.     Long live the King of the Fender bass who did some of his most remarkable work with the King of Soul, Marvin Gaye  (With all respect to Bob Babbitt's great playing on Inner City Blues)
B000RJO578|5.0|Ok seriously, you don't have to read all of the other reviews out there.  I promise you... except for a small percent, that this movie is amazing if you loved Shaun of the Dead.

The great thing about HF is the running jokes and that it is a joy to watch it over and over again to find new things that you didn't catch before.    I have seen it 4 times now and I look forward to find new things that I didn't notice the first time around.    That is all I can say, the movie speaks for itself.

So, I probably would have rated this book higher (particularly since the proceeds go to such a good cause), but for two things:<br /><br />1) I bought Tom Colichio's [[ASIN:0307406954 Think Like a Chef]] at the same time<br /><br />2) There is a big difference in how europeans cook - or at least, how Jamie cooks that will  probably mske his book less appealing to aspiring American cooks than other book options (not that it doesn't have appealing ideas)<br /><br />Here's my best example (from a veggie, fish lover): Both Colechio's book and Oliver's have a very similar recipe: Basically - Salmon cooked in sea-salt.  Jamie's has a whole fish, eyes and all (and recommends not cutting the fish).  Tom's uses a salmon filet.  Jamie talks about how to buy the best fish and types of fish, Tom talks about basic techniques you can build upon to create great dishes. I prefer Tom's \\"no eyes\\" on my fish and shrimp approach.<br /><br />Both books are laden with colorful pictures of the finished dish, and step-by-step instructions... Oliver's is filled with dishes that don't look particularly appealing. (Could be all those whole fish - and seemingly over-cooked veggies). Tom's is filled with \\"starter\\" recipes you build upon - that look scrumptious. (Pan roasted mushrooms - YUM!)<br /><br />For REAL cooks (I'm a novice's novice) this may be fine.  Some of the basic instructions on herbs, creating a salad, diagrams of meat cuts, what equipment you need for your kitchen and Jamie's unpretentious style - still make Oliver'sa worthy choice for a novice chef.  Other, more ambitious illustrated topics, like how to deal with a squid, make other starter books a better choice for true amateurs.<br /><br />BOTTOM LINE: If you're looking to learn cooking - this has some good insights - but you may be turned off by the European flavor of receipes. Between the two books, for a foodie amateur chef, Colichio's is a better choice. Or --- just grab both for a whole education.foodie amateur chef, Colichio's is a better choice.

B00004Y87J|5.0|This tremendously entertaining spy film from director Alfred Hitchcock's British period set the standard for all man-on-the-run films. Based on John Buchan's novel of an innocent Canadian tourist in Britain thrust unexpectedly into the world of spies, it's hard to find a better one than this.<br /><br />Robert Donat is the Canadian, Richard Hanney, who gets more than he's bargained for when a woman named Annabella Smith (Lucie Mannheim) in fear for her life is killed in his flat after revealing to Hanney that she is a Secret Agent protecting the secrets of her country from a dangerous network of spies known only as the 39 Steps.<br /><br />With a murder charge hanging over his head he must heed her words and make his way to Scotland and get to the bottom of the 39 Steps in order to clear his name. But when a misguided guess leads him right into the hands of the dangerous head of the network, Professor Gordon (Godfrey Tearle), the hunter now becomes the hunted.<br /><br />He is helped along the way by a few kind souls who believe in his innocence. Peggy Ashcroft is memorable as a lonely farmer's wife who risks everything to help him escape. A kiss given by Hanney for her kindness is a poignant moment in a film both enjoyable and exciting. When he and a much more reluctant young woman named Pamela (Madeleine Carroll) are hancuffed together there is a shift in the film's tone as romance enters into the story.<br /><br />The classy Carroll was a perfect match for Donat and the back and forth between the two is still enjoyable today. Sneaking off into the night while he is sleeping she overhears the men after him and comes back to help him, finally believing his colorful story of murder and spies. A tune stuck in Hanney's head will finally lead him to the \\"Memory Man\\" and a grand finale.<br /><br />This is most definitely a film classic. Another good screenplay from Charles Bennet and good work from photographer Bernard Knowles, who always made the most of the sometimes meager budgets given he and Hitchcock in Britain, enhance a story with both tension and a dash of romance. Other than the Criterion Collection DVD, prints are less than grandiose but still watchable. The MGM video version is quite excellent. A must see film.n Britain, enhance a story with both tension and a dash of romance. Other than the Criterion Collection DVD, prints are less than grandiose but still watchable.

0061015725|1.0|For the third straight book from Michael Crichton that I've been disappointed.  He really needs to re-read his earlier novels to capture that magic again.      This book was predictable and the characters were so flaw that it was hard to root for them instead you rooted against them. It reminded me a lot of a book I just finished, Mount Dragon, but that one was a lot better. I've been a fan of Crichton for a long time and hopes he get his act together.    To sum it up, this was plain awful and if you need a good Crichton fix, read Congo, Jurassic Park, or Sphere.  Maybe next time, the real Michael Crichton will stand up.

0307237702|4.0|There's been a lot of talk about how people don't know Obama, and how they don't feel entirely comfortable with him as a candidate.  Whether this is due to his unique background (living in Indonesia), his race, or the recent attention directed at his pastor, The Audacity of Hope is worth reading for the way it helps the reader know more about Barack Obama.      He comes across as an eloquent, thoughtful, self deprecating, and, at times, even hesitant man.  He recognizes his shortcomings as both a father and a politician, and when it comes to taking a stand on issues, he weighs them carefully (like a true law student, for those who have been there).  I find these qualities to be positive for a potential presidential candidate.  Of course, one will come away from reading this book knowing more about Obama's opinions on religion, the Iraq war, education, family values, and economic policies.  But if the real worry about Obama is his quality as a human being, then this book should give anyone insight into that issue.

B000WGWQG8|5.0|This [[ASIN:B000WGWQG8 John Adams (HBO Miniseries)]] production vividly illustrates the reality that John Adams, George Washington, Thomas Jefferson, Alexander Hamilton, and all the others are not just plaster statues or monotonous names in a history book.  They were real people:  the lived, they loved, they laughed, they cried when they hurt, and they were mortal.  They put all they had, including their lives, on the line to reach for an ideal.  Many of them gave their lives, and those who didn't, gave up much of their lives.  The years John and Abigail spent apart could never be recovered.  Their story was repeated by thousands of others, and still is.  As Adm. Tarrant (The Bridges at Toko-Ri)said, \\"Where do we get such men?\\"  They set a standard for all of us.
B0019FOC5E|2.0|Let's get real folks. This is not a great movie. Although Meryl Streep and the supporting cast are great fun, let's talk about some things that were not so great. First off Pierce Brosnan's singing sounds like a rake running across a chalkboard. He can't sing; bottom line. I actually cringed. Next let's mention the fact that they break out into song and it had nothing to do with the storyline. On the stage it works, but in a big screen setting it doesn't and it left me saying....HUH??? Lastly, who choreographed this film, some cheerleader who didn't make the team? It looked like the Macarena on steroids. Although I admit that the soundtrack is great, it's better than the film was. Can we say straight to DVD???
B000001GXB|5.0|I just listened to Pollini's recordings of Beethoven's late sonatas again after a few years exploring other recordings, such as Brendel's fine cycle from the 1990s, Schnabel, Solomon, and so on. As much as I love those other recordings, Pollini's set is still invigorating and profoundly moving, probably my favorite.    What I find remarkable is how, by starting from a close fidelity to Beethoven's detailed notations, Pollini is able to uncover an entire world of musical expressivity. Supported by a well-engineered recording that holds its own 30 years later, Pollini brings our attention to all sorts of details and shadings that often pass by unnoticed, but which add to our understanding of the music and its cumulative emotional and intellectual impact. For instance, this time I noticed more of the underlying thematic connections between Opp. 109, 110 and 111, which really do have to be understood as a triptych. I also heard more allusions to Baroque music, which I'm quite sure Beethoven intended and which Pollini subtly brings out.     So is there anything lacking? I think Brendel is better at bringing out the humor in Beethoven. Perhaps the Allegro Molto (2nd movement) in Op. 110 could have been more volatile. Perhaps the great Adagio Sostenuto from the \\"Hammerklavier\\" sonata could be a bit more \\"Appassionato e con molto sentimento.\\" On the other hand, Pollini doesn't make that same movement painfully slow like some other pianists do, and he always maintains clarity of structure. The Adagio Sostenuto is in the sonata form, which is very unusual for a middle movement. This is what gives the movement such weight and tension, and it's important for listeners to be able to follow it despite all its complexities. If you stretch that movement out too much---some recordings run over 20 minutes!--there's a danger that the listener can lose touch with its underlying driving force. In that regard, Pollini's performance succeeds beautifully.     Now if you're looking for theever-elusive state of mystical transcendence there's plenty of that to spare in Pollini's performance of the Arietta from Op. 111. What's amazing is that in that same recording, he performs so cleanly that you can practically write down every note and dynamic marking while you're listening!    To sum up, Pollini's set may not be the only game out there, but it's still arguably unsurpassed. It's also an ideal recording for those who are hearing these pieces for the first time, because of Pollini's fidelity to the score. If you listen to Pollini's recordings carefully, you'll get to know the music really well and develop an appreciation for its underlying architcecture. This deeper intellectual understanding, as Pollini well knows, is in no way a impediment to feeling, but rather its true pathway.
0399246665|4.0|I love the \\"My Very First Library\\" by Eric Carle concept but my daughter is only 11 months old and it's a little above her \\"reading\\" level just yet.  The pages are divided in half making it hard for her to turn the pages so she just goes on to the next book.  The books are about colors, shapes, etc. and you have to match the top of the page with the bottom of another page and I believe it requires a higher level of motor skills.  Therefore, if you looking for Eric Carle books and have an infant or young toddler, I would go with the \\"Brown Bear & Friends\\" board book set, it's perfect for this age.
B0015KO52S|4.0|The Raconteurs are ... radical. Don't even listen to Consolers of the Lonely if you have sensitive ears. It sounds like Jack White left the tape running - thank god. This is what all the old fogies wish they could hear (today) from an early super group like Led Zeppelin in their prime. They tweak and twist all sonic sensibilities just far enough without breaking any confidence in how the story ends. It cuts across generational boundaries in music taste in a way that nothing this year has done - so far. If you ever wanted the White Stripes to pick up a few more instruments, this is your chance to hear what that could sound like with masterful musicians holding them in hand.

6304698798|2.0|Well, I really had high hopes for this one.  Being a lover of western films, I decided I needed to go back and watch all the ones I had never seen, especially the old staples, i.e. The Wild Bunch, Magnificent Seven, etc.  Having never watched one from this series, and being a moderate Eastwood fan, I was excited to get it home and watch it.  All I can say was I was not impressed.  I thought the musical score was annoying, screechy, repetitive, and not very interesting. It seemed Sergio Leone's greatest camera technique was extreme close-ups, or panoramic shots.  While you can never criticize a beautiful panoramic shot of the West, I tire of people going on and on about the cinematography of this film.  So we got a close-up of these guys eyes, wow.  It's all a bit over dramatic.  Many of the scenes were long and drawn out. I was so annoyed with unnecessarily drawn out scenes, that I fast forwarded towards the end when they were searching the tombstones.  It was like Leone was trying way too hard, and everyone is buying it.  Hate to criticize something so well liked, but when compared to other movies of this genre, it really doesn't stack up.

B000TXZVGQ|5.0|I dearly loved this series when it first aired, and have always had fond memories of it.  I have never seen an episode again since it was cancelled, so I was a little worried that a second watching would not live up to what I remembered...thankfully, I was worried for no reason!  I recently bought the boxed set, and I thoroughly enjoyed every second of every episode.  MSCL was perfectly cast, and each character just pulled at my heart strings.  Far from being about \\"beautiful, young and well-off\\" (as a way off base reveiewer on amazon stated), these teens were real.  I graduated high school in the early eighties, and the trials and tribulations of Angela still made me remember so strongly how I felt at her age (even during my recent viewing).  I was near tears every time Ricky was in a scene;  partly because Wilson Cruz so perfectly portrayed Ricky's hurt and his sensitivitu, and partly because I remembered the Christmas episode \\"So Called Angels\\".    I had forgotten how frustrating a character the prickly Brian Krakow was!  I would just start to like him, and then he would do something that made me want to kill him.  And, Rayanne...so annoying one minute, and then so sweet and vulnerable the next.  I cried my eyes out when she did the scene from \\"Our Town.\\"    And, I don't think I could ever say enough positive things about Claire Daines' portrayal of Angela.  Hard to believe she was so young at the time!  Whenever she was getting ready to cry, her forehead crinkled up, and you I just feel her pain in my own heart. I loved her!  In the book that comes with this set, Joss Whedon (whose tv series are also among my top 5) writes a brief essay about the effect MYSCL had, and the fact that it was almost a perfectly-written show.  He says basically that it didn't talk down to teenagers OR adults, and I think that is what makes it such a great show, even today.  Every minute of it felt real, and I felt like I knew these characters.  If you every loved MYSCL, or if you never even saw it before, I highly recommend buying the series.  You will thank me for it!

Once you have discovered this beauty, it will not let you go.<br /><br />Straight up, the characters, and the story of firefly will suck you in. This show is set in a sci-fi future world, but that's not what it's about.  So you sci-fi geeks - come to  Firefly! While at the same time if you are scared about a sci-fi show... don't be. It's about the people and their relationships with each other, and their journey in life, which so happens to be in space on the same ship. You will laugh, you will be on the edge or your seat, you will hurt when they hurt.<br /><br />It takes a REALLY good story that is done REALLY well with REALLY good actors that play REALLY good characters to get me to like a show, but when it does...man it's magic. And that's what Firefly has done. By far - my #1 favorite show now. I will do whatever it takes if it is ever possible, to bring Firefly back. THIS is how to tell a story through a live action show.

Joel did an OK job and despite the fact that Batman is not BLONDE (Val Kilmer) i was still able to watch the horrific Batman & Robin because it was silly campy fun.<br /><br />I went into Batman Begins thinking its great that Batman is dark again. But walked out the theater feeling it was missing something. I gave Batman another chance with the Dark Knight and after watching the new movie i realized what that missing certain something was. It was that Nolan made Batman into a COP film. Theres a difference between a COP film & a Super Hero film. And please dont tell me Batman is a cop because he is a detective etc and that he is not a super hero because he has no magic powers. The bottom line is the movie was AWFUL. If i wanted 2 see a COP film i would go ahead and RENT HEAT with Robert DeNiro. On top of that i hate the freakin BATMAN COSTUME. The ears are so close together i kept thinking they were gonna touch each other. On top of that Bale puts on some AWFL Italian Brooklyn accent everytime he is in the Batman Costume!!! JUST AWFUL on every ASPECT!!!!!!! AWFUL!!!!!<br /><br />Almost 2 1/2 hours of my life i will never get back!!!!!

B000R7GKQE|5.0|Storywise: The writers of the show really raised the bar this season in terms of character development and ramping up the emotional resonance in such episodes as \\"Heart\\", \\"Roadkill\\", and \\"In my time of dying\\". Spook factor still was retained throughout the season in episodes \\"Everybody Loves a Clown\\", \\"Folsom Prison Blues\\", \\"Nightshifter\\", and \\"Usual Suspects\\". All in all, second season really rocked.  Package: The DVDs for this season still showcase the show's picture and audio perfectly. In fact, this second season DVDs have the audio tracks mastered in 5.1 Dolby Digital which sounds way better than last season DVDs (1st season was only 2.0 Dolby stereo). One of the highlights of this DVD package is the included gag reel/bloopers shots (acting flubs and pranks)---its just way too hilarious.  As a show, Supernatural is one amongst the best out there right now----way better than those atrocious so-called reality shows. Can't wait to get my hands on season 3.

B000TGCR38|5.0|I don't want to give anytning away.  The oher reviewers are saying too much about the plot, which is full of twists.  A great movie, with an European sensibility, which would have never gotten made in Hollywood.  At 140 minutes, there is not a dull moment.  A great thriller, mystery and historical WWII movie, with no CGI baloney to ruin a perfectly acted movie.  The actors carry the movie.  The movie is in Dutch, German and a little English here and there, but the dialogue is never too complicated to where the subtitles are inadequate.   If you want to see a great action/adventure film of the kind Hollywood can't seem to make anymore with out throwing special effects at it,  this is a great, great movie.  Please don't read the plot details (all ou need to know is that it is about the Duhc resistance against the Nazis), and let this move WOW you.
B00005JPY0|5.0|Nolan proved himself more than capable with his first stab at DCs' iconic hero, and has again made the case that he should be the only director allowed near the Batman universe.  Why? His minimal use of CG, the excellent script and stuntwork alone make his Dark Knight definitive, but it is his work with the actors and their dialogue that make this a special film.  While there are things to quibble about possibly storywise and action wise, you simply can't fault the performances he gets out of this outstanding cast.  The photography coupled with a complex and involving screenplay that wrings every bit of character development possible out of everyone involved leaves the viewer slightly out of breath and awed by the end of this truly spectacular summer movie event.  The best of next generation technology, mixed with some classic trojan horse surprises and non digital filmmaking send this picture soaring heads and tails above your average superhero fare. No digital blur here, and no flies either just spectacular performances (Oldman, Ledger, Eckhart) and a truly fufilling cinematic Batman experience.
B0009MAO46|5.0|This video is so much fun and marks the tenth year of Toy Story being out. I think Toy Story will become a \\"timeless treasure\\" because it is great for adults as well as kids.
B000274THQ|5.0|Some things are painful in life. As a life-long anti-Stalinist, pro-socialist militant the demise of the Democratic Republic of Germany and its theory of \\"socialism in half a country\\" and later, on its heels, the demise of the Soviet Union and its theory of \\"socialism in one country\\" were nevertheless social disasters of historic proportions for me. One result is that we live in the age of the one superpower world dominated by the United States and its genuine capacity for making trouble, militarily unchecked by any other power. Friends there is nothing good about that. Witness Iraq and many other hot spots in the world.    But enough of that because, despite my obvious different political take on what happened in East Germany in late 1989 and early 1990, this film Good Bye, Lenin is a very interesting view on what happened to one fictionalized family of mixed political and social sensibilities during that period. The film has been advertised as a comedy, and although there are some funny moments like the various attempts by some of the characters, including the main character son Alex, to create alternate social universes, there is more than a hint of satire (and sometimes localized `insider' satire) here. And satire is a very precious commodity in an age where everything is taken literally, whether it should be or not. Thus, a good prescription is -fight hard for your politics but take a minute to see humor in the sometimes absurd ways of this wicked old world.    The device used to create the central plot in this film has a long pedigree, although I believe that it might be the first time that it has been used in an attempt to preserve socialist reality. Quickly outlined, a son (the previously mentioned Alex) attempts, almost manically at times, to create \\"socialism in one bedroom\\" for his ailing mother who upon awaking in 1990 after eight months from a coma induced by a heart attack after witnessing him being beaten by the Statsi needs to, on doctor's advise, avoid any `excitement' on pains of relapse (and possible death). The dramatic tension revolves around an ever-widening and bizarre conspiracy (including drawing in his skeptical Russian girlfriend, his sister, her boyfriend, the neighbors, former colleagues, etc.) to keep mom in the dark about everything that has gone on during that time.     A subplot, however, reveals that Mom, in need of illusions as she might be, has secrets of her own in relationship to the whereabouts of her husband who left for West Germany in the past without his family, mainly because she balked at going for her own reasons. There are, additionally, many sight gags or things that pass for sight gags in a society that had a very limited exposure to the `virtues' of Western consumer society. But enough said, get this film if you want a very smart look at what happens when cultural changes come fast and furious. Not everyone can, or should, adjust accordingly. But also get it, if I may add, so that you can begin to understand why mother wanted to stick with the old socialist ways, as she understood that concept. And maybe fight for them, as well.

B000X1Z0BU|5.0|When an Irish street musician meets a young Czech flower seller on the streets or (unknown) city in Ireland, they strike an easy friendship.  Their initial conversation is spontaneous and not restrained.  Soon they learn they are both musicians who can play guitar and piano and also sing a duet without much practice.  Their musical education differs (he seems to be self-thought, while she is classically tranied pianist), and so does their social status but that is not barrier to their mutual musical creative force.  Their professional relationship grows thru their mutual respect for their musical talent but soon they are falling for each other emotionally to.  He has been hurt before with disasterous consequences it seems, while she has had her own share of misfortune of a different kind.  Can these two be together?  See the movie and make a decision for yourself!  The real treasure of this movie is young Marketa Irglova.  Her wide open eyes transcent innocence and purity that is rarely seen on film.  While Glen Hansard sometimes seems like he is trying too hard to make people love his music, Marketa's mere presence in the film, her subdued singing and performing give this little movie a real spark.   Without Marketa this movie simply could not exist.
B0010X745K|4.0|This is of course not your standard dumb monster horror flick, not with a King novella as material and Darabont doing the movie. But it is also not quite satisfactory.<br />There is too much being in two minds going on here! Just look at the reviews, so many of them: so many are absolutely enchanted, so many others are totally put off. That must mean something.<br />The reviewers' split mirrors quite appropriately the film's own schizophrenia: it is about important issues of the American society of today, about its separation in camps, about the split of modern and scientific rationalism versus the spirit of biblical literalism. Pragmatism versus Old Testament is the main message. But the plot is based on the horror vision of science gone wrong, of monsters born out of the hubris of military scientists.<br />How can one get disentangled from that spiderweb? One can't easily, and the ending has a nice touch of futility. Don't get too logical about the ending, many will be frustrated by it, one can even argue that it is not logical, but it is certainly a powerful message.<br />Before watching the film, I knew little about it and somehow hoped that it would be creative with using mist for horror. Then the fact that the mist is actually just hiding monsters came as a bit of disappointment, it somehow cheapened the film. On the other hand, the monsters are quite good, with a distinct Boschian quality. Finally, the main monster is of course good old M.G.Harden who preaches the fear of an apocalyptic kind of god very effectively. Sort of a Lady of the Flies.
B000001FRY|4.0|Fans already familiar with U2 may feel a pleasant surprise or a jolt to Boy. For those old enough to have bought it around the time it was released, they undoubtedly have a different perspective than mine own. It is a deceptively good little album. The Boys and Steve Lillywhite were really just kids who really knew little idea of what they were doing, either with their instruments much less in a studio.     The words popularly used to describe it in reviews are words like \\"raw\\" \\"youthful\\" \\"innocence\\" etc and I those are undoubtedly the case. I think unbridled, earnest, mature and humble are some others. \\"Cat Dubh\\" was a favorite of mine with these slinky, almost sultry, guitar riffs. \\"Out of Control\\" (\\"Our first single! We hope you like it!\\" for those who've seen U2 Go Home Live from Slane from 2001) shows bits of their anthemic future within it. The innocence is surely there in \\"Stories for Boys\\" and \\"The Ocean\\" in its airy waviness was often used to both start and finish their shows at the time.     All in all, a weighty, modest, and gently inspiring first effort.
B0013FSL3E|5.0|700 years into the future, Earth is uninhabited.  Humans have left its wasteland and now live among the stars.  Left behind to clean up the mess are WALL*Es (Waste Allocation Load Lifters-Earth class).  After all this time only one WALL*E (Burtt) remains.  He goes about his insurrmountable job, collecting and compacting trash.  One day, things change.  A spaceship arrives and a robot named EVE (Knight) emerges.  She is on a mission of her own, but soon becomes friends (of a sort) with WALL*E.  When the time comes for her to leave, WALL*E hitches a ride, and is off on a new adventure that may just save the human race.<br /><br />Pixar has done it again.  WALL*E is an amazing film that introduces one of the most loveable characters in recent memory.  The animators humanize the robots through their actions, making the audience care for them.  There is very little dialogue in the film, especially in the first half, and the high quality animation drives the story successfully.  There is an ecological message to be found here, but it isn' forced.  There is enough humor and action to entertain the whole family.  WALL*E is probably the best family film of the summer, and I highly recommend seeing it.
B000PKG7I4|3.0|This is good album of Amy's early work to see the progress she made, but is pales in comparison to Back to Black, which is her masterpiece.
B0007PAMR4|1.0|Ok, the special effects are great for the time this movie was made, but that's really all this movie has going for it.  I am most disappointed by having to give this a full star rating.  The plot is mechanical with a lame voice-over back story.  The characters shallow and lacking any legitimate motivations or redeeming quality.  Honestly, I can't see what all the hype is about.
B00104QSOM|2.0|Great acting!!  But wasted on a sluggish, slow moving, poorly edited story line.  I thought it was because I'm a women.  But my very male other half was more disappointed than me.  And he's the one who wanted to see it!

B000RPTQ1C|3.0|Coldplay has come out with a much awaited album amid criticism aimed at sappy self-absorbed lyrics, and uninspiring major chord tunes (for those of us who want something more involved).    Guitarist Johnny Buckland has done better this time, although he hasn't done anything groundbreaking--influences that come to mind are Radiohead and U2.  That being said, the new music of Coldplay doesn't necessarily match the old voice of Chris Martin, who continues to weep and squeak--this time over \\"death and his friends.\\" Perhaps next time he'll sweep us off our feet.    It's good to hear Colplay taking a different approach than their past albums, experimenting with different lyrics and music, and with that in mind I'd recommend this album to any past or present Coldplay fan, and in the spirit of trying something out, to an anti-Coldplayer.
0385339100|3.0|I finished this book a while ago. The story is interesting but its just streched out too long. How did this guy make all this time to spend so much time with this old person and then to work day and night to set everything up etc?. He must have had 48 hr. days.<br />I did like the ending because i sorta did expected it but on the other side I didnt think this would seriously end like this. So it's okay to read but its not one of my favorite books.
0670020745|3.0|I have an AVM just like the author and I was really interested in reading about her experiences.  I enjoyed the book, but it could have been about 40 pages shorter.<br /><br />Like most books for a large audience, the technical details about the brain were lacking.  In fact, Chapter 2 is called \\"Simple Science\\" and anyone with a middle school education could understand it.  I really wish authors would treat science as if I actually made it past 10th grade.  Also, I was quite surprised that the author, a neuroanatomist, couldn't find better drawings of the brain.<br /><br />The author recalled her experience via psychotherapy years after her stroke.  I was a bit surprised that the author treated her recall of the day of her stroke as if her memories were fixed, as if they were just sitting in a file cabinet and the Gestalt therapy opened the drawers.  The author is ecstatic about the plasticity of the brain yet she never acknowledges that memories are much more \\"plastic\\" than the brain.<br /><br />By the end of the book, the author is writing in broad, flowery language:<br /><br />\\"If I want to retain my inner peace, I must be willing to consistently and persistently tend the garden of my mind moment by moment.\\" (Uh oh.  I think the author is starting to spread the fertilizer.)<br /><br />\\"The focused human mind is the most powerful instrument in the universe.\\"  (Huh? Really?  Has the author ever considered that there might be other extraterrestrials with minds that are more powerful than ours?)<br /><br />\\"Paying attention to how you burn energy and how foods make you feel inside your skin should be a top priority.\\"  \\"Let [scents] move you into the here and know.\\"  (Ohhh....aromatherapy!  Is there a chapter on feng shui?)<br /><br />This is all fine and dandy but I was expecting something more scientific and analytical from a neuroscientist.<br /><br />For example, the author argues that everyone has complete control over how they react and behave.  Unless, of course, they are are \\"truly\\" mentally ill (her word, not mine, see page 157).  I disagree with the author on this point--mental illness is not like a switch.  There are shades of mental illness, from a bit of depression to manic/depressive.<br /><br />This book will be quite inspirational for both stroke victims and their caretakers.  The author recovered so well because of the intense, loving efforts of her mother.  And she recovered completely.  Quite amazing.e page 157).

I liked this book because it was only speaking on how things were.As I've seen some people have had issues and called him a racist. If you really read the book then I would not know why you would call him that.They obviosly missed the point.    Because of his backround i believe that he can unite people within the states and he can also unite America with other countries again.GO OBAMA!
B0018AK9RA|1.0|Profoundly stupid.  An entirely new level of stupid.  (Kinda like Nostradamus himself, if you know anything about this joker.)  To create this kind of badness takes a certain kind of horrible genius.  Like classic Priest in reverse.  A nightmare Judas Priest if you will...only it's not a nightmare, they actually MADE this album.<br /><br />If you thought Turbo was stupid, prepare yourself.  This makes Turbo seem like Sgt. Peppers.  Remember Lochness from the last album?  Well, multiply that times 15.  This is the kind of album that you give to a friend as a prank-gift.  Like an old tennis shoe or moldy sandwich.<br /><br />My advice for any long time Priest fan: Don't be sad, rather make the best of it.  Throw a Nostradumas album party, and revel in the black comedy of it all.  Pretend Priest just made the greatest comedy album of all time.<br /><br />So...it's come to this...effing Nostradamus.  My god.
B0002OERI0|1.0|When your band has hit the skids and you want to be taken seriously as an \\"artist\\" (after ripping off the Ramones for years), you can always do what Green Day does here - create an anti-American \\"concept\\" hardcore/punk album.  The media will help cover for all of your resultant and inevitable flaws and lack of actual creativity, because in the process of trying to be political you help reinforce said media's own prejudices, which they seem to like.  Unfortunately for Billie Joe and company, mixing Pink Floyd and the Descendants in the same blender doesn't work, and the only thing they ended up with was a (charitably described) mess.  The only tolerable track is \\"Holiday\\".  The rest of the album is suitable for only those who breathe the rarefied air present within the state of California.  Because there are still a fair number of us who remember proper examples - Ramones' \\"Bonzo Goes to Bitburg\\"; Sex Pistols' \\"Bodies\\"; Stiff Little Fingers' \\"Alternative Ulster\\"; just about anything from Suicidal Tendencies' or Fear's first albums.  Hilariously, the album was originally released with DRM and its associated root-kit.  In doing so Green Day rather hilariously \\"Spoke truth to Power\\" by forcing DRM up the collective alimentary canals of its fans on behalf of the RIAA.  So much for sticking it to the Man.
B000J10KTQ|5.0|For those of you who (like me, were format neutral, as in bought both HD DVD and Blu-ray.) still have HD DVD get this version! It's that the Blu-ray is missing special features, or the visual quality is worse (Most dual-format movies have the same encode.) but the audio quality is perfect! That's because it comes with a Dolby TrueHD track (which the Blu-ray version lacks.) and it is astounding. As of right now, it's the only version to contain this soundtrack, and it's well worth it.     For those that don't know what a TrueHD track is, it's a lossless version of the soundtrack, which means it's master quality! Believe me, it makes a difference! This is a great movie with a great visual look, and with the HD DVD version, the definitive version of the audio.
B000WGWQG8|5.0|I thouroughly enjoyed this series. It was a great reminder of what was endured for us to have the freedom that we have today.  This should be required viewing in all High School history couses.

B0013J9KOO|5.0|Before going to see HELLBOY II: THE GOLDEN ARMY, my wife and I sat down a re-watched the original HELLBOY with our 15 year old daughter, because she had not seen it.  I truly enjoyed seeing the original film again after a few years, and was once again quite interested in the trials and triumphs of \\"Red\\", \\"Blue,\\" \\"Liz\\" and all the others.    So the next night, we went to see HELLBOY II, and frankly, I was nearly blown away.  It's a far superior movie.  Everything the first film got right, this one gets right again.  And what amazes me is that I'm not really a \\"superhero movie\\" fan or a \\"comic book\\" fan...yet I think these particular characters, as realized by Guillermo del Toro and his team, are marvelous meldings of \\"mundane\\" human emotions with outsized powers.  Hellboy is incredibly strong, supernaturally durable and also the spawn of the devil.  Yet he drinks too much, is too clingy with this girlfriend and has an all-too-human short fuse.  Abe Sapien is shy and softspoken...but he also has psychic powers and can breathe underwater.  Liz is an attractive but troubled young lady who can set some pretty nasty fires just by thinking about it.    You might say that X-MEN plows the same soil...yet those films, to me, are all glossy surface level efforts.  Perhaps it's because there are SO MANY X-Men that few of them  are more than assemblages of some character traits.  In HELLBOY, we almost forget we're looking at \\"monsters.\\"    That effect is aided by the fact the Del Toro has concocted some of the most monstrous looking creatures ever seen in a mainstream film.  I don't even know what to call his creations...they sometimes look like something from H.P. Lovecraft, sometimes like something from the Cantina in STAR WARS and yes, sometimes like creatures from PAN'S LABRYNTH.  But all his creatures are striking to look at and brilliantly executed.    HELLBOY II follows the efforts of Hellboy and his gang to restore the truce that has long existed between humans and \\"creatures\\" such as trolls, gremlins, elves and many other far less identifiable \\"fantastic\\" beings.  The evil Prince Nouda is essentially breaking the truce with man, and intends on ridding the earth of them forever by bringing back to life an army of 4900 giant robots than simply cannot be destroyed and setting them to rampage through our cities.      So often, stories like this just aren't terribly interesting, but I have to say that this one kept me going throughout.  Much simply had to do with the imagination with which all the beings are presented.  In an early, very striking scene, the Prince confronts his elderly, elf-like father.  When the old man dies...his body turns into a stone statue.  I know we've seen this kind of effect before...but the feeling this transformation evokes is a lovely mixture of awe at the beauty and dread at the finality of the change.      But thankfully, the world has Hellboy to protect it.  He charges into the fray, barely understanding what's going on, but hellbent to kick some butt!!  His crush first, ask questions later attitude gets him into trouble, of course...but also wins the affections of the audience.  He's like a little kid with some big powers.  His is somewhat domesticated by his fiery girlfriend (their relationship has progressed in surprising ways over the years)...but he still can't help letting his big arm fly!  The crew is joined by a new \\"leader\\" in the form of Johann Krauss, an entity made entirely of gas!  Krauss animates an old-fashioned diving suit in order to give himself some shape...but his powers (and his Teutonic arrogance) give the movie a nice jolt.  He's a completely new creature.  Not physically strong like Hellboy or empathic like Sapien.  He's smart and he knows some pretty cool ways to use his gaseous state!  He and Hellboy have what amounts to a locker-room showdown that had me and the entire audience in stitches.    I see that I am just going on and on in my review.  There's so much more I'd like toshare...but I hope you at least get the gist that this is a highly entertaining and worthwhile film.  Del Toro is a visionary director.  But  I would be remiss if I didn't mention that the film is truly made wonderful by the fully-realized and heartfelt performance of Ron Perlman as Hellboy.  He'll never get an Oscar for a part like this (not that he should)...but he gets a Summer Movie Season of 2008 MVP award for his very charismatic turn.  Selma Blair  has never looked better.  Doug Jones (Abe) is wonderful in his physicality and the always enjoyable John Hurt even makes an early, welcome appearance.  Only Jeffrey Tambor (normally so good) comes off poorly as their befuddled boss.  His part is actually written to make him too much of a buffoon, so he's actually only irritating most of the time.    In the best sense, I felt swept away by this film.  I am quite eager for Part III!!

Two, I'm not really into the analogies they have used which included a variety of Country music stars.  The antagonist was describe as a Jessica Simpson look a like.  Are you kidding?  Here:  Aprodithe was beatiful from head to toe, but her divine outer beautfy unmatched her loathesome innerself.  Three:  It's like a 3rd rate mixture of Harry Potter and Twilight.
0385341067|5.0|This book resonated with me like my first reading of \\"To Kill a Mockingbird\\". Llyod Jones paints a vivid picture of daily life on a small island in the Pacific. As trouble descends, the tension mounts. Each generation finds a different way of coping and the point of view of an adolescent girl adds poignancy to the tale. A wonderful book which makes the reader take a hard look at what matters at the heart of life.
B00005YJMX|5.0|This is the first Werner Herzog movie I've seen and now I'm interested in seeing his other movies.

I think the German version is superior. Enjoy!
0743290119|1.0|I was really excited to pick up this novel after Weisberger's great success with \\"The Devil Wears Prada.\\"  Unfortunately, it was very disappointing on many levels.      The three main characters, Leah, Emmy and Adriana, are supposed to be best friends, but their friendship is contrived and hardly realistic.  It is easy to get confused between Leah and Emmy because the way they talk and their personalities are exactly the same. Brazilian Adriana, on the other hand, is an extreme stereotype and seems a very unlikely friend for Leah and Emmy.    The dialogue between the main characters and their love interests also reveals a lack of consistency.  It seemed like Weisberger was trying to make her characters seem overly witty.  Some of the exchanges made me cringe.    Although it is an easy summer read, it is annoying to read about three young and successful characters who moan and complain because they're going to be 30 and their life is over without a man and a ring on their finger.  We need stronger female role models.    This novel seemed like a rushed effort.  To top it off, there are several typos.

B000Q6GX5Y|2.0|First blu-ray disc I've bought, and first time seeing this movie.  Disappointed on both counts.  Blu-ray technology is not much ahead of regular dvd if at all.  The movie itself was not impressive.  Gladiator + Lord of the Rings + God of War.  That's a formula which should've been cool but managed to be nothing special.  Why do some people think this is brilliant?  I never got excited though I really hoped I would.  A summary of this movie would be: clouds and sunlight, abs of steel, slow motion stabbing and blood, some CGI critters.  If you can get more out of it than that, you must be a genius.  300 isn't nearly as creative as some people imagine.
0743298039|5.0|The audio version is well narrated and superbly done.  Be patient for the first 20 or minutes or so - at first I was like, oh dear, I'm not so sure this was a good purchase, but then, I couldn't stop listening.  Fabulous writing!  Wonderful, spooky story..many twists.  I laughed; I cried and was entranced by the whole atmosphere of the story!  And her \\"experience\\" at the end, with her unexpected visitor, warmed me so much!  I also appreciated the way the author \\"wrapped everything up\\" at the end.  It's a MUST listen!

As Terry Leather, Statham actually touched me as he seemed to care about his wife Wendy and their family.  Yes, he's a bank robber; and of course robbing banks is bad, but he does it for the right reasons!  Statham who won the \\"Most Offensive Male Character\\" award from the Women's Film Critics Circle at least plays a loving husband who is tempted by the luscious Saffron Burrows, but loves his wife.  Keeley Hawes, who will be the next Lara Croft in the \\"Tomb Raider\\" series, does a nice job here as the mother who maybe finds it exciting to have a bank robber husband, as long as he doesn't get caught.  New Zealand director Roger Donaldson who did \\"Dante's Peak\\" with Pierce Brosnan in 1997 does a good job focusing on a complex story, keeping the pacing and elements interesting.  Saffron Burrows plays Martine Love who is blackmailed by customs authorities into getting a crew together to steal compromising photos of the Princess from a bank lock box.  Burrows has been in \\"Troy\\" (2004), \\"Peter Pan\\" (2003) & \\"Frida\\" (2002).  In addition to looking stunningly beautiful, she holds up her acting chops as she slyly tries to slip the photos into her bag before the eagle-eyed Terry Leather.  Stephen Campbell Moore who had a small role as James Stephan in [[ASIN:B000VNMMQG Amazing Grace]] (2006) plays Kevin, one of the crooks with a brain who manages not to get killed.  Daniel Mays who played Tommy Nettle in [[ASIN:B0013XZ6X4 Atonement (Widescreen Edition)]] & Sid in [[ASIN:B0007P0YKY Vera Drake]] does a good job as the dimwitted Dave Shilling whose private parts are bigger than his brain.  James Faulkner who was in two \\"Bridget Jones\\" films plays the polished con man Guy Singer, who winds up with a terminal backache.  Richard Lintern who played another bureaucrat in \\"Syriana\\" plays Tim Everett who concocts this illegal scheme to regain the photos compromising to the Crown.  Dick Clement & Ian La Frenais produced a strong caper screenplay after having penned [[ASIN:B000ZLFALI Across the Universe (Two-Disc Special Edition)]] & [[ASIN:B000LV6OJE Archangel]] with Daniel Craig.

B00197U0DU|4.0|OK, let's get it out in the open right here: if you're the type of person that fell in love with the band in the 80's and have \\"Invisible Touch\\" in every format released, this album is NOT for you...best to grab a copy of \\"When In Rome\\" and re-live the memories. For that matter, if you're the type of Genesis fan that actively puruses the Internet for bootlegs of Phil Collins' bass drum track to \\"Watcher Of The Skies\\", again, best to pass this one up and go for the box set (preferably Vol. 1)<br /><br />BUT, if you're an interested fan of the band overall and want to get a sense of their history and the band's roots, then this album is what you're looking for. However, buyer beware: this is NOT what you may call 'typical Genesis'.<br /><br />Produced by London wunderkind Jonathon (\\"Everyone's Gone To The Moon\\") King in 1969, the premiere effort by a group of fledgling writer/students sounds more like a lightwieght version of early Moody Blues than the progressive powerhouse that was to evolve from this through the 70's with the odd exception (\\"One Eyed Hound\\", The Conquerer\\"). Overall, the album is lush with strings (\\"In Hiding\\") and overblown horn arrangments (\\"One Day\\"). This, however, still wasn't enough to rescue it from sounding thin and rather self-indulgent. But even with these faults, you can hear the seeds of what was to come later (the jump between this and their subsequent release, \\"Trespass\\" is night-and-day...but that's another review). Peter Gabriel's vocals sound timid and almost childlike throughout, complemented by backup vocals by Mike Rutherford, Tony Banks and Anthony Phillips (\\"Fireside Song\\"); however, the drumming is almost non-existant in places,causing the work to sounds limp in spots.<br /><br />The big question here, however, is: why another re-release? this version has nothing new to offer; even the inclusion of an additional single (\\"That's Me\\") has been done before. Maybe they wanted to clean up Gabriel's tambourine sound?<br /><br />It's an historic album nonetheless...but mainly for the Genesis purist who want to complete their collection.s an historic album nonetheless...but mainly for the Genesis purist who want to complete their collection.
B00005JPY0|3.0|Yep, that's right, they took a comic book character driven movie, and turned it into an episode of, \\"Law and Order\\".<br /><br />First of all, Heath Ledger does indeed make an outstanding psychotic bad guy, but in all actuality, his performance would have been just as good without the make-up, and that, sadly, is where the movie failed him.<br /><br />Because you see, the movie is trying so hard to be a mainstream crime drama, and distance itself from its beginning as a comic book, that Heath's Joker, and Bale's Batman seem out of place, and they pretty much would have been able to accomplish their roles without the costuming.<br /><br />Gone is any sense of the comic book's stylization, replaced instead with the mundaneness of any crime drama TV show, where the city looks like any city U.S.A. (or Canada for that matter, because at times, I would have swore that Toronto, Ontario, was standing in for Gotham City) the cops all look like any cops off of TV, as do the henchmen, with the exception of the Joker and his grease painted face (which, like I mentioned before, stands out like a sore thumb in this world, and not for the right reasons either).<br /><br />You see, when I go to see a Batman movie, I want to feel like I'm living in the comic book world of Batman and his Gotham City, for the 120 or so minutes that I'm there, I don't want to feel like I'm looking at stuff happening in my own world (like I said, TV does a more than adequate job of that, with shows like CSI, Law and Order, etc.) but sadly, that's what this movie only seems to aspire to, trying to make Batman and the Joker fit into our world instead of creating a world that they fit into.<br /><br />Also, for some reason in this film, it was decided that anytime Batman spoke, no matter that it be to Gordon, Rachel or a crook, that his voice have this, \\"Nails on a Chalkboard\\" kind of electronic vocal enhancement, added to his already gruffly whispered voice, which made listening to him talk, almost unbearable.<br /><br />As well, the sound effects guy must have gone in after the initial sound mix had been done, and over tweaked his sound effects, because there are a lot of instances during the film, where I was franticly trying to hit the, \\"Subtitle\\" button on my remote, only to remember that this was a theater, and not equipped with such conveniences (oh, and in case you're wondering about the status of my hearing, I have to where ear plugs at concerts because it is so acute, and even then, I can still hear every note being played, and further more, my wife complained of the same thing after the film).<br /><br />So in closing, it's an okay movie, but a not so great comic book inspired film (I'll take Tim Burton's flawed but stylistic vision of the caped crusader, over this new incarnation of the dark knight, any day).ust have gone in after the initial sound mix had been done, and over tweaked his sound effects, because there are a lot of instances during the film, where I was franticly trying to hit the, \\"Subtitle\\" button on my remote, only to remember that this was a theater, and not equipped with such conveniences (oh, and in case you're wondering about the status of my hearing, I have to where ear plugs at concerts because it is so acute, and even then, I can still hear every note being played, and further more, my wife complained of the same thing after the film).

0061367036|5.0|This is a unique book and well worth the read, even if you are not a \\"Supernatural\\" fan.  It is purportedly written by Dean and Sam Winchester, and they, of course, cannot refrain from making smart remarks about one another.  This makes the book fun to read, but what makes it truly interesting is the fact that writers didn't make up the stories for the TV series and then publish them in a book; this folklore, myths and legends have been around Man started putting sounds together to make words.  As you read this book, you cannot help but wonder where such folklore and legend originated.  What did someone see, hear or feel some dark night that lead to such tales as Bloody Mary, the wendigo, werewolves, hellhounds, sthriga, or the thousand other creatures or demons we've read about?  I highly recommend this book for its uniqueness and its peek into that dark, frightened corner of the human mind.
B000E1ZBGS|2.0|This movie was the most disappointing version of Pride and Prejudice yet...There was so much of the story left out that if you had never read the books you'd be lost(as were the two people watching with me) The actors were not convincing in their roles. Overall I was very disappointed in this film.
B0014BQQYS|1.0|What a disappointment!!! I was waiting for the release of this title for more than two months and bought it as soon as I could. However, and despite the quality of the movie, THIS IS NOT A HIGH DEFINITION PRODUCT, as the blu-ray category implicitly suggests. In fact, its image is not better than what is found in ordinary DVDs, and this made me not only quite disappointed, but also worried about my future purchases, as I noticed the same problem in other BD products (concerts, specifically). Anyway, customer surprises could be avoided with a clear indication of the image definition in the BD boxes (as well as in the corresponding catalog of Internet retailers, like Amazon).
B000F9RB9Y|3.0|The transfer quality of this film's Blu-ray edition is nowhere near the optimal resolution of the disc format; I'd say it's no better than its DVD version. Since this movie's budget was likely smaller than its sequels, it stands to reason that the film quality might not have been as stellar during production. However, I hope that this is merely laziness on the part of the Blu-ray transfer itself, and that the master film can be restored to better clarity in the future.    Until a new Blu-ray version is released, save some cash and buy the DVD. You'll get the same quality.
B00005JPY0|3.0|I can't believe I let myself get caught up in the hype.  First of all I will give a &lt;&lt;&lt;SPOILER>>> warning right away.  I thought it was a good movie, but far from great.  Ledger gives an amazing twisted performance.  The movie starts off with a bang, and moves along nicely for most of the running time.  But now to my problems with it.  I have a lot, so I will just go over a few of the major ones.  I thought it had a bad ending (Batman wanting to be chased), they don't even spend a second trying to make us believe Gordon dies, so there's no effect when he comes back.  And my biggest problem is that they can't get the voice right.  First of all Bale's dark voice sounds incredibly stupid, but worse than that the director doesn't know what he's doing with the voice. The dark voice is his normal voice. He became mad at the world and criminal activity and became the dark knight. When he's around people who don't know he's Batman he uses the nice voice, which is fake. When he's around people who know he's Batman, he uses the dark voice, which is his normal voice. Now if the voice thing was my only problem with the movie, then I probably would have loved it, but unfortunately the movie is riddled with holes. I liked the first movie A LOT more. And am I the only one that noticed that Two-Face looks like a skinless Terminator?  And one more thing, I have to go over the action scenes.  The non fight scenes are pretty spectacular.  I can't knock those at all.  But the hand to hand fight scenes are not that great.  I liked the first fight.  It doesn't have the extreme editing that Batman Begins had, but every fight seems to have the same choreography.  And that correlates with another problem I had with the movie.  A lot of scenes seem rushed.  Really a shame.  So while it's a good movie, just don't go into it like I did thinking it will be one of the greatest movies ever made.<br /><br />Rating- 3.5/5
0446618306|4.0|I have read some better books by Nicholas Sparks. (the Wedding keeps coming to mind, simply because of its amazing and heartwarming twist at the end).  Dear John is not a bad book, and the short amount of time it took to read was easily worthy of the story.  As most Nicholas Sparks novels, this was an easy to read love story. My gripe is that I didn't feel the chemistry between John and Savannah.  It rung true as first love, certainly.  But I never felt the pull between this couple as I have between most of Sparks other couples.  I truly feel that the stregnth of this book lies in the story of the relationship between John and his father.  Savannah's biggest contribution is what she did for that relationship.  In that father/son relationship lay all the beauty that I've come to expect from Sparks. The ending of the book satisfied me for the most part, but I can definitely see why others here don't share that viewpoint.  Sparks does amazing things with character development and per usual, these character's feel like living and breathing entities. I gave this book four stars due to how much the father/son story affected me (bawling baby!) but if I was rating the stregnth of the love story, it would maybe be a three star. However, I was sad to see the book end, and I could see this book's potential for a sequel.
B00005MP58|5.0|This is my favorite movie version of Pride and Prejudice and the bes that I have seen. The actors are convincing and the story line includes enough of the original story that you understand what's going on even if you hadn't read the books. An excellent job was done when this was made!
B0011V7P0A|4.0|Tom Petty is the embodiment of a classic rocker. He and his band, The Heartbreakers, are in the same league as Bruce Springsteen and The E Street Band or Bob Seger and The Silver Bullet Band. The personify a certain working class ethos and stuck to their roots, all while codifying their influences to a sound that became singularly theirs. In Petty's case, that was a love of sixties rock that revolved around The Byrds and The Rolling Stones, with the Heartbreakers adding inspired backing.<br /><br />When the leather jacketed face of Tom Petty first smiled from [[ASIN:B000065AI3 Tom Petty & the Heartbreakers]] in 1977, his look and sparse, muscular backing had many prematurely lumping him into the punk camp. But discerning listeners caught on quick, with the chiming \\"American Girl\\" and the bluesy \\"Breakdown\\" becoming favorites. When [[ASIN:B000065AI4 You're Gonna Get It!]] arrived soon after, both the rocking \\"I Need To Know\\" and the hook-laden \\"Listen To Her Heart\\" flirted with the Top 40 and more eyes came to Petty's talent. \\"Listen\\" is an amazing confection, both chiming Byrds-ish guitar and muscular hook.<br /><br />Even with these signs of greatness, it was Petty's third album that delivered the goods. [[ASIN:B00005ABK8 Damn the Torpedoes]] remains a classic, the moment when Petty hit his stride as a songwriter and The Heartbreakers became more than the sum of their influences. Four songs from that album are here, the blistering \\"Refugee,\\" the pleading \\"Don't Do Me Like That,\\" along with the stellar \\"Here Comes My Girl\\" and \\"Even The Losers.\\"<br /><br />What followed his turn to super-stardom was the legendary price war with MCA, with the suits wanting to make [[ASIN:B00005ABKC Hard Promises]] a premium price release, and Petty demanding it be kept lower...to the point that he threatened to title the album 8.98. Petty won the battle and delivered and album that was stellar, and had a great single in \\"The Waiting.\\" The real curiosity was that Petty gave up one of his best songs to Stevie Nicks, and their duet on \\"Stop Dragging My Heart Around\\" catapulted her solo \\"Bella Donna\\" album to number one.<br /><br />Petty continued to make strong albums, but none in the classic range of \\"Torpedoes.\\" [[ASIN:B00005ABKB Long After Dark]] was one of the most straight ahead rock albums he'd released, yet \\"You Got Lucky\\" one of the most new-wavey singles. There was the arty [[ASIN:B000002O1P Southern Accents]], which found the sitar-accented single \\"Don't Come Around Here No More\\" playing out in a deliciously psychedelic fashion (and the \\"Alice In Wonderland\\" inspired video). Then there was the rollicking and under-rated [[ASIN:B000002O3B Let Me Up (I've Had Enough)]], with the Bob Dylan co-composition \\"Jamming Me.\\"<br /><br />Still, things were starting to feel like diminishing returns. That is, until Petty decided to try a solo album. The stripped down and back-to-basics [[ASIN:B000002O5L Full Moon Fever]] re-certified Petty's greatness as a songwriter, and was as solid from start to finish as \\"Torpedoes.\\" \\"Running Down a Dream\\" is as good a rocker as he's ever done, \\"I Won't Back Down\\" is an anthem that threw down a gauntlet (and became a post 9/11 rallying cry) and \\"Free Falling\\" could be Petty's best song ever. It was more acoustically based than his Heartbreakers albums, and set the tone for future solo albums like [[ASIN:B000002MUN Wildflowers]].<br /><br />That success brought cloning when the band got back for [[ASIN:B000002OH3 Into the Great Wide Open]], which is an OK album that followed a perfect one. Regardless, the creative juices still were flowing for \\"Learning To Fly\\" and the title track, which are more fully produced than the \\"Full Moon Fever\\" songs. It also brought Petty and the Heartbreakers to the end of their MCA tenure (roughly 2/3's of their history so far). This \\"Greatest Hits\\" is basically the same as one issues in 1992, the difference is that a remake of Thunderclap Newman's \\"Something In The Air\\" is replaced by\\"Stop Dragging My Heart Around\\" (and the great \\"Last Dance With Mary Jane\\" is still here). Given that the older Tom Petty & the Heartbreakers - Greatest Hits is no longer listed as 'new,' this is a great place to get Tom Petty's singles in one solid swoop.\\"Last Dance With Mary Jane\\" is still here). Given that the older Tom Petty & the Heartbreakers - Greatest Hits is no longer listed as 'new,' this is a great place to get Tom Petty's singles in one solid swoop.
B0011Z5CV0|4.0|I bought this toy because my daughter has the Fisher Price laugh and learn puppy and she loves it, so I wanted to get her another, similar toy as a back-up. The buttons on the snout are too small for her to press to make noise, but when I push the buttons she really likes it. It will be better when she's older, but for now it's just another stuffed animal.
B00009NHC5|5.0|I am buying this movie as a gift to a friend who likes it as much as me! If you like retro 60's, a great story line with good acting and of course...a thriller, this is for you!! Being an Audrey fan helps a little too! Highly recommended!!!
B00008G9JN|5.0|I've been listening to Ian Anderson of Jethro Tull since I was a teenager, 40 years ago. I am amazed at his skill and control of the flute from which the most magical sounds emerge. Timeless celtic music that takes you into the woods to commune.
B00000G3AZ|5.0|This is in my opinion the best movie version of Emma...Gwyneth Paltrow comes across just like the Emma I read about. I disliked Emma in the story so much until the end and it was the same in this movie version. Very good.
B001BWDG0W|5.0|We were kind of hijacked into seeing this film by friends who saw it opening night.  We were up for an adventure, so what the hey?  We ended up happy because this was a truly \\"feel good\\" movie.  If you haven't seen the movie, the soundtrack may seem weak in the male vocal department; you'll probably be happier with the greatest hits of ABBA or the original broadway soundtrack.  But after seeing the movie, this soundtrack brings back all the good feelings you had walking out of the theatre. My husband and I were not particularly ABBA fans then or now, but we really liked this flick, and he TOLD me to find the soundtrack! (Caution: your experience may vary)    Don't be fooled by the critics.  They are the realists who have no imagination. This is entertaining the way that other sleeper \\"My Big Fat Greek Wedding\\" was, and critics didn't think much of that flick either.    If you want to download the best, most differing from the original ABBA version, get \\"The Winner Takes it All.\\"  Talk about putting emotion in the lyrics! That Streep can act!

0312323867|4.0|The beauty of this book is in the writing.  Ms. Giffin takes you from having an intense dislike for the selfish & vain main character, Darcy Rhone, to absolutely loving her.  Halfway through the story, you realize that you want to defend her and see her do well which, I never would have dreamt of doing during the first book \\"Something Borrowed\\".<br /><br />Great read, great writing & endearing characters!

B000I0QKDS|5.0|Plenty of Good tracks, only 1 or 2 I think could have been left off (Old Man River?). You'll enjoy if you're a Blues fan- rare chance to hear Rod Stewart (before he became a Pop Idol) sing the Blues, & he does it well. Some great piano work too!
B00005JL2O|3.0|Say anything three times and it's funny, according to the secret rules of sure-fire comedy (the same rules that say the word \\"chicken\\" is unfailingly a rib-tickler). Austin Powers in Goldmember, Mike Myers's third incarnation of his gormless but irrepressible swinging sixties British spy, really is pretty funny.    After three movies and six years of the shagadelic, flouncy-shirted, buck-toothed homunculus and his ever-expanding cartoon world, it's become easier to surrender than resist. Place it against Men in Black or Mr. Deeds or any of a host of other barren summer comedies and the difference is obvious: Myers's sheer fertility of invention is of a different order, and even if he misses as often as he hits, he's definitely a swinger.    Even if the gag-to-wince ratio isn't high, there are enough punchlines thrown here to make a sphinx smirk. Father, forgive me, I must confess: I sprayed my popcorn.    Powers, the self-adoring spy whom Myers says he invented one day while riding back from hockey practice and listening to Dusty Springfield sing The Look of Love on the radio, is not so much a spy spoof (the sixties were already crawling with spy spoofs) as nostalgic sixties anglophilia: Think of it as James Bond crossed with the Carry-On Gang, or maybe Jerry Lewis imagining he's Cary Grant. The character(s) -- Myers plays four parts here, three of them villains -- finds that tightrope between enviable childish narcissism and obnoxiousness where much comedy struts.    The successor to the massive success of the $200-million second instalment of the series, The Spy Who Shagged Me, starts off with a large bang, and not, this time, of the sexual nature. Instead, it's a series of scenes from a film within the film, featuring a cast of stars way too famous to be named and an action stunt that should make the James Bond franchise pack up its product placements and go home.    Dr. Evil, Myers's best character, with his pinky-chewing and air quote signs and poor ability athigher numbers, takes centre stage early. Having found a way of taking his unscrupulous behaviour into legitimate business by taking over a Hollywood agency business (he charges just 9 per cent instead of the usual 10), he's stationed himself in a lair above the Hollywood sign and is concocting one of his usual plans to blackmail the world's leaders for a largish amount of money.    The entire evil cast (with the exception of the bald cat, Mr. Bigglesworth, who seems to have dropped out between trailer and movie) is back -- Dr. Evil's annoying son, Scott (Seth Green); Dr. Evil's silent clone, Mini-Me (Verne Troyer), who proves he has a mind of his own, and the rest of the Evil cast, including Number Two (Robert Wagner) and Frau Farbissina (Mindy Sterling). Myers hides himself under a couple of tonnes of makeup as an obese Scotsman, Fat Bastard, who is in love with his own body effluents.    Myers also plays a new Dutch villain called Johann Van Der Smut, a middle-aged seventies playboy nicknamed Goldmember (regrettable smelting accident), who enjoys roller-skating, disco dancing and eating strips of his overtanned skin.    The best piece of casting falls on the side of good, with Michael Caine as Nigel, Austin's swinging, and insufficiently paternal, spy dad. Caine (who himself played a bespectacled spy in The Ipcress File) looks the part, and turns on some real actor intensity, especially in his raging declaration that he hates intolerance and Dutch people.    Austin, for some reason, has to travel back to swinging Manhattan to \\"Studio 69,\\" to rescue his dad, who has been captured by the evil Van Der Smut. There, he teams up with Pam Grier-inspired Foxxy Cleopatra, played by pop diva Beyoncé Knowles of Destiny's Child, who has great abs and a way of looking at Austin as if she just scraped him off the bottom of her platform shoes.    There's no doubt that Goldmember has its long flaccid stretches, and a good deal of repetition of familiar gags: shadow play, inadvertently obscene subtitles and an assortment of euphemisms for genitalia. At times, Myers's toilet-bowl humour overfloweth.    The strategy here is the basic Mel Brooks string o' gags school of comedy. While it's not high wit, it never stops trying and, occasionally, as in the prison-rap number inspired by Hard Knock Life from Annie, the results are inspired.    A flashback to Austin and Dr. Evil's early days at the Intelligence Academy, for example, shows a savvy such scenes rarely manage; the young actors are close enough physically to the adult characters, but what makes it work is Myers's dubbing in their adult voices.    Fourth-time Austin Powers is a spectre that can only arouse apprehension. No one can look forward to a bigger role for Van Der Smut (or bigger rolls for Fat Bastard). Who cares if Mini-Me decides to talk? But taking a page from the International Man of Mystery, let's not worry about the future when the present (and past) are groovy. When it comes to Austin Powers, three's a charm. Conrad Alton, Filmbay Editor.

B0018CWEYY|4.0|Lost season 4 has many twists and turns. It's episodes are done pretty smart. We learn that 6 passengers got off the island by flash forwards instead of flashback. The season just leads to a brilliant conclusion of how they actually got off the island and what happened to the people that didn't. In no way is this the season though since it still raises many questions in the finale and through-out the season.<br /><br />  Sine season 3 ended with Jack calling a freighter to come rescue them eventhough Locke and Ben warned him that it would be a huge mistake. What do they know though,...Jack's a Doctor and Doctor's know everything due to years in college lol. But the all mighty brainiac does bring some harm to the island. Since one of the freighter guys is a big military nut that has been hired to bring Ben off the island. He doesn't care who he kills to succeed in his mission. So no, he can careless about rescueing them off the island.<br /><br />  Kevin Durand has been seen in movies like 3:10 to Yuma and Wild Hogs but it's in Lost that he really shines as the military nut. Hell he would have been an awesome Punisher for Punisher 2! The other new cast members who are familiar from many movies are good as well. Jeff Fahey of Lawnmower Man and of Planet Terror does some of his better work as well as a helicopter pilot for the freighter guys. Ken Leung (X-Men 3) is perfect as a wiseass who has the ability to talk to the dead. His character is pretty interesting and I hope they do more with him in season 5. Jeremy Davies (Saving Private Ryan) is another familiar face as a brainy guy who basically just wants to do...brainy stuff on the island lol. His brains can help sometimes and he seems pretty harmless but you never know when he's being honest to the castaways.<br /><br />  Due to the season of being cut down due to the strike, we don't even get a Sawyer flashback. He is still however used well through-out the season and still one of the cooler guys of the show. The show still delivered a pretty solid season. It answers many questions while also being one of the more thrilling and unpredictable seasons. I'll also say that we find out who's in the coffin and many of us were dieing to know after season 3. Of course, I'm not going to give away who it is though. We also get the reappearnce of a familiar face and I'll give you a hint, he used to scream \\"WALT!\\" lol.how still delivered a pretty solid season.

These, by the same lady, are gorgeous, full luciously colored and artistically captivating.  Better still, they're so evocative that even while they adhere basically to the Rider/Waite (so anyone can use them who knows that foundational system), they invite new awareness from my subconscious, and the readings with them/plus book evoke from present situations something I might call \\"a bit more\\".

0800177363|5.0|Director Penny Marshall's Awakenings is being promoted as a \\"hurrah for the handicapped\\" movie, but it's much more than that. Derived from an account published in 1973 by neurologist Oliver Sacks, this too-strange- not-to-be-true story is magical because it doesn't really try to be - as    Dr. Malcolm Sayer (Robin Williams), the miracle-working character based on Dr. Sacks, says, \\"We have to adjust to the realities of miracles.\\"    The realities, as dramatized in Steven Zallian's script, are these: In 1969, Dr. Sayers accepts employment at a chronic-care hospital in the Bronx and is mysteriously drawn to a group of catatonic patients referred to as \\"living statues.\\" Convinced that the patients are cognitively and emotionally alive, despite their external fossilization (some have been immobile for more than 30 years), he investigates their histories. At first, he is stymied by the guesswork diagnoses on record - \\"atypical schizophrenia\\"; \\"atypical hysteria\\" - and mutters to his nurse (Julie Kavner), \\"You'd think at a certain point, all these 'atypical' somethings would amount to a 'typical' something.\\" They do: Dr. Sayer discovers that the statues have in common an episode of viral encephalitis.    The miracle is this: Aware that the experimental compound L-DOPA has proved effective as a treatment for Parkinsonism, a disease Dr. Sayer believes resembles the condition in which his statues find themselves, he proposes using the drug on one of them, Leonard Lowe (Robert De Niro), a middle-aged man who began \\"disappearing\\" into brief episodes of paraylsis at the age of 11 and was permanently hospitalized nine years later, in 1939. When the drug \\"awakens\\" Leonard, Dr. Sayer asks for permission to prescribe it to the rest of his post-encephalitic patients.    At this juncture, Awakenings itself awakens - it sloughs off the \\"hurrah for the handicapped\\" genre and becomes a movie about the handicap of the human condition in general. Unfortunately, it's impossible to discuss what transpires next without giving the story away, but it can be reported that the subsequent events, for all their atypical specificity, become a blanket metaphor for typical human life (much of which is spent sleepwalking) - it's evident that Dr. Sayer was \\"mysteriously\\" attracted to the statues because he is one of them.    Marshall, director of Big and, in another life, Laverne on Laverne and Shir ley, elicits performances from Williams and DeNiro that are exceptional. The former, who can't help being funny, is profoundly serious as the emotionally stunted physician unable to heal himself, and the latter, who can't help being serious, is profoundly funny as the emotionally open patient able to heal his physician. The two strong men are complemented by two stronger women, Kavner as the doctor's sympathetic nurse, and the aged Ruth Nelson (her career began in 1926) as the patient's patient mother. Awakenings is a small, simple movie about a large, complex issue, the waste of human opportunity. It could have been made by Thornton Wilder's Emily, who dies at the end of Our Town and from the cemetery exhorts the living to come fully alive. Conrad Alton, Filmbay Editor.

She does 60's pop songs (no song is very 4 minutes) with a 21st century voice.  Having lived through the 60's, these are songs Lulu, Dusty Springfield or Cilla Black would have sung.  The arrangements are in keeping with the arangements of the mid 60's.  She's done something quite unique here and I hope to hear more of her in the future.  This girl has talent with a capitol T.

B0014WSWTY|5.0|When Hector Berlioz discovered Beethoven Symphonies through the Soci&eacute;t&eacute; des Concerts du Conservatoire in Paris (in 1828), he wrote: \\"At another point on the horizon, I saw the immense Beethoven rising. The jolt this gave me was almost comparable to the one I had received from Shakespeare. He opened up a new world in music for me, just as the playwright had revealed to me a new universe in poetry.\\"<br /><br />This would be a very accurate description of what I felt when I listened to this rendition of these Symphonies. And I know them, and enjoy them, and I have the Karajan, Bernstein and Gardiner recordings. I thought there could be no more surprises, no new recording to improve what has been made until now. But I was wrong.<br /><br />Jos van Immerseel and Anima Eterna get these compositons right.

Nevertheless, I felt that the final three chapters held out some encouragement and justified the time I had spent wading through the Buddhist jargon and grating dismissal of all that my culture holds dear. There is much to agree with here; ego is indeed the source of many ills, most of us live mostly unconscious lives, peace would be preferable to the tension and stress many experience, and so forth. I found his reinterpretation of the words of Christ fascinating and a bit off-putting, but worthy of thought. Of course, thought is part of the problem, to Tolle's way of seeing the world. We in the Western world do indeed benefit from more \\"being\\" and less \\"doing\\", but I believe it's balance we need, rather than an abrupt dismissal of the entire achievement-oriented way of life.

B000E1ZBFY|5.0|This film is a beautiful, moving tribute to a man who taught love and practiced what he preached. I think it is wonderfully acted by the title roles. I cannot recommend it highly enough. Pope Benedict himself gave it a favourable review but you don't need to be Catholic, Christian or even religious to recognise the goodness of JPII and see the gift he had with people- especially youth.     This film captures the essence of who Karol was and what motivated him in a time of oppression and fear. It puts the message of John Paul's papacy 'DO NOT BE AFRAID' into a new light when you see how hard he must have struggled not to let fear conquer him in his life.     There is a second part to this production- 'KAROL; THE POPE, THE MAN' in which the actors reprise their roles Piotr Adamczyk is utterly superb in portraying the Pope to the point of his death. This young actor really does deserve praise. The second part is only available through Amazon Canada but  is worth ordering. It is done with the same sensitivity and a higher level of accuracy than 'A Man Who Became Pope'. Together these are truly great films that inspire and uplift like the man himself.     I hope as many people as possible get the chance to enjoy them.

Only be sure to read it in private, because if you're like me you might find yourself laughing out loud on public transportation, which can be embarrassing! Enjoy!
0375701427|2.0|This book gives me the sense that works by successful authors, once they're beyond a certain point in their career, just aren't edited before publication. American Pastoral reads as though Roth dictated it in one sitting. He frequently loses himself in unrestrained reveries and ends up repeating passages verbatim, backtracking through his thoughts, hoping for renewed inspiration or to regain the thread of his story.<br /><br />Roth casts a conservative glance back at the 60s, looking for somewhere to place the blame for the revolutionary upheaval of the era, and though there are hints of classical tragedy in his story, Roth's links between the minuscule failures of a father and the dissolution of his society are unconvincing. His main character, \\"The Swede\\" is a conformist, Jewish jock who will only appeal to those who confuse athletic prowess with character. Roth infuses him with hackneyed greatest generation virtues and announces early on that the character will do nothing but suffer for them. The Swede is unwitting to the point of being witless, and that combined with Roth's unsympathetic caricature of radicalism left me with a bitter, Forrest Gump aftertaste. In general, the characters serve as little more than a lattice for Roth to weave lush descriptions of New Jersey around.<br /><br />I put up with Roth's mensch and maenads up to the very end, afraid that I would miss some masterful stroke that would redeem such a mess. Rarely have I been so relieved to finish a book, though I have to give it to Roth that his voice alone can sustain a story. That's all that was there.

B000I5Y8ZU|5.0|TBH I had never listened to this band until a few days ago.  Being 37 my tastes are more older school metal (Queensryche, older Metallica, Dream Theater etc...) with some newer stuff mixed in (HIM comes to mind.)  I was looking for something new to listen to and this caught my eye.  Well give it a chance.  This album is excellent.  My Chemical Romance has the sound of an updated Pink Floyd mixed with Queen mixed with commercial punk (ala Green Day.)  Also what I enjoyed was the drummer and guitarists really pushed themselves.  They worked hard on this album if that makes sense.  Too many musicians today seem to take the easy way out with beats that are simple with no high hat work....little to no guitar solo's and down tuning with the same old sound.  This band made the best album they could and it shows.  It shows on EVERY song.  If you work hard and take chances (expose yourself artistically) anything is possible...to bad more bands chose not to.
B000MNP2KI|3.0|I think most people was caught up with the whole \\"Bond\\" thing, new actor, etc. and didn't notice some real big \\"faux pas\\". Although there has never been real dates set, and you can't just deal with the making of the first Bond movie (Dr. No), there were events that gave you an opportunity to know approximately what decade if nothing else you were in. This Bond, which is supposed to depict the \\"beginning\\" for James, has several references to things that happened more recently than the older Bond movies indicated but mostly, has M making the biggest mistake in her speech when she speaks of \\"9/11\\". Please, didn't anyone hear that?   I don't usually notice mistakes on the part of the writers, wardrobe people, set designers or actors when I see a movie for the first time (unless it is sooooo bad)because I am intent on the movie and sometimes I never pick up anything unless it is pointed out to me, but this was so blatant that when I heard it my mouth dropped open. C'mon folks, don't tell me that you can actually put that reference in the beginning of the James Bond '007 saga?  S from NY

B0000ADY9I|5.0|I didn't purchase this cd for myself. I bought it for my Pastor's son for a graduation gift. Why you ask? His son is playing bass and learning about classic rock music. When I gave the cd to him I said, \\"this is the greatest live recording ever and a must have for every musician\\".     If you have never heard the Allman Brothers before, you picked a great place to start. The original line up perform an outstanding set of songs along with the famous \\"Mountain Jam\\" just after finishing a blistering \\"Whipping Post\\". If you are already an Allman fan, then why don't you own this recording? You call yourself a fan. Though I think the band is still one of the best live shows today nothing will top this live recording...trust me.

B000IOM0X8|2.0|I have read Clive Cussler's Book Sahara and as usual it was a great book.  As you can see I am a big fan.  If a book appears on the shelf with Clive Cussler or even NUMA files - It is immediately bought.  I saw the film Sahara - What a dissapointment.  The actors were very much less than convincing.  The thread of the book was totally lost in the movie.  Somewhere so was Abraham Lincoln.  The story plot was very much lost and re-written in the movie.  If I were Clive Cussler and wrote this book and then saw the movie - I don't think I would recognize it as the same thing.  In my final opinion movie very poorly done.  Wrong actors to play the parts and plot so re-written.
0446402389|5.0|Riveting  5+ stars.  One of the very best novels of 2008. Outstanding in all respects!  After my wife read Child 44  in two nights, she gave it to me as a must read.  Well, having spent some time visiting behind the Iron Curtain I wasn't too thrilled about reading a book about Stalinist Russia.  My impressions of Russia centered on the color gray.  From the people, to the environment, to daily life, everything was a dismal gray.  In short depressing.  Nonetheless, my wife is right 95% of the time so I picked up Child 44 and started to read.  2 days later I was stunned by how outstanding Mr. Smith's debut novel was.  It is simply terrific.    Dark, brooding, mysterious, and yet filled with hope.  It is Russian to the core, yet throughout it all there is a timeless since of \\"we will persevere, we will survive!\\"  It is the story of one man's struggle to find his inner peace.  Stolen from his biological family at an early age, Leo Demidov is raised by surrogate parents and eventually becomes a part of the post WW2 Stalin era as a member of USSR State Security Force.  An ardent defender of the state system, Leo becomes transformed when he realizes that a serial killer of children is on the loose in Russia.  He knows that this is not a recognized crime in Utopian Stalin Russia.  As he pursues this killer, he himself is denounced as a state troublemaker and is exiled to a backwater town just west of the Ural Mountains.  There he continues his quest for the serial killer despite being told to cease and desist by the State Police or face exile to the gulag or worse death.  Through all this Leo comes to realize what is truly important in life, saves his strained marriage, and continues to persevere in his hunt for the killer.  Child 44 is a wonderful story of the indomitable human spirit.  It is both Kafkaesque and Zhivagoesque in its portrayal of Stalinist Russia after WW2.  Don't be put off by the subject matter or period-it is simply too good a book not to read.  Characterdevelopment was absolutely superb.  Mr. Smith was able to do in 426 pages what some authors couldn't do in 4000 pages.  He wove a tight story but developed the characters with ease and fluidity.  An amazing feat for his debut novel.  Some graphic violence but very germane to the story.  No gratuitous sex or language.    Must read.  Gripping.
0451213092|1.0|After reading _[[ASIN:0451207149 The Pillars of the Earth]]_ and its sequel, I was doing a little Web research (Wikipedia) on the Perot rescue and found out that Ken Follett had written a book about it: \\"What luck!\\" I thought.<br /><br />I thought wrong. The format of this book is so dry and dull it was almost unreadable. I forced myself about half-way through just to get the information, and by that time, I couldn't give up on it, even as a loathed every page.<br /><br />The plain fact of the matter is that this story is just NOT that interesting. It's a big tease. Nothing ever happens. In the end, the same result would have come to pass even if Perot hadn't sent the rescue team. And also, so much for Perot being a big capitalist hero: He was in Iran setting up a socialist welfare state for Iran, much like he helped establish here in the U.S.<br /><br />The story of Perot's \\"rescue\\" of his socialism-enabling employees is worth of an extended magazine article, but not a full-length book. And no matter the length or format, Follett's approach to \\"non-fiction\\" novel writing (which he says this isn't) is mind-numbingly boring.<br /><br />Avoid this volume at all costs.
B000SM7QUC|5.0|I usually like my music A LOT heavier and faster, but I dabble in some rock every now and then. It takes something unique to catch my ear though - the songwriting has to really stand out. Sixx:A.M. has done that. VERY catchy songs with great melodies and riffs. The vocalist shows a lot of different variations on his singing and does a great job relating emotion in the songs.  I was surprised at how much I like this cd and hope they keep writing songs together. I even gave the new Motley Crue a try, but it bored me.
B0013J30W2|4.0|\\"You're just a thug that can bend bullets.\\" - Wesley Allan Gibson<br /><br />Twenty-four year old overly apologetic Wesley Allan Gibson (James McAvoy) lives an insignificant life. One filled with a pompous best friend (Barry; Chris Pratt), a conniving girlfriend (Cathy, Kristen Hager), an egotistical boss (Janice, Lorna Scott), anti-anxiety medication to last Gibson till the 22nd century, and zero hits on Goggle search strings with his name on it.<br /><br />But that all changed when he met a woman named Fox (Angelina Jolie) as well as her associates aptly named The Repairman (Marc Warren), The Butcher (Dato Bakhtadze), The Gunsmith (Common), The Russian Exterminator, and Sloan (Morgan Freeman). Gibson is fed the story that he is the offspring of Mr. X, an eminent assassin who works for a 1000 year-old collective known as The Fraternity. Sloan adds that Mr. X was shot down in cold blood by a rouge Fraternity agent called Cross (Thomas Kretschmann).<br /><br />Gibson is aggressively trained by Fox (and at times senselessly) in order to build his pain tolerance, proficiency in both close quarter combat situations as well as range weapons, and his genetic gift--the ability to rapidly increase his heart rat \\"at an excess of 400 beats per minute thus sending abundant amounts of adrenaline into his bloodstream\\"--thereby giving him the ability to see and do things that ordinary people could only attempt to comprehend.<br /><br />At the completion of his six-week training, Gibson is accepted into The Fraternity and sent out on several assassination missions before being given the blessing by Sloan to pursue Cross.<br /><br />Gibson journeys to Europe--the birthplace of The Fraternity--and interrogates Pekwarsky (Terence Stamp who's past iconic roles included: General Zod (Superman I & II), Sir Larry Wildman (Wall Street) and Supreme Chancellor Valorum (Star Wars: Episode I - The Phantom Menace)) who manufactured the ammunition of Cross. Pekwarsky is coerced to set up a \\"meeting\\" with Cross which leads to Gibson and Cross locking horns aboard a bullet train.<br /><br />Fox intervenes by boarding the aforementioned train with an automobile that eventual contributes to the derailing of the locomotive. In the process, Gibson is able to avenge his father's death by killing Cross--but not before he is able to disclose that he in fact is Gibson's true father. Fox confirms Cross' admission and proceeds to execute Gibson--who manages to escape by shattering the tempered glass window where he and Cross were situated.<br /><br />Pekwarsky rescues Gibson and nurses him back to health with the help of a \\"miracle wax\\" that stimulates the body's white blood cells, which accelerates the healing process to a matter of days for injuries that would normally take months to heal. Pekwarsky then shows Gibson proof of his father's love for him and his wish that his son live a normal life away from The Fraternity.<br /><br />Pekwarsky also passes on information (via a loom weaving, that when decoded contains the name of an assassins target) that Sloan has been earmarked for termination for quite some time. But instead to fulfilling the code of The Fraternity, Sloan had taken it upon himself to fabricate other targets for his own personal gain. It was also established that this was primarily the reason why Cross went rouge.<br /><br />The climactic ending takes a page out of Kurt Wimmer's Equilibrium, (a 2002 futuristic science fiction film starring Christian Bale (Batman Begins; The Dark Knight)) wherein Gibson infiltrates The Fraternity's base of operations--an unassuming Textile Factory--and begins to detonate as well as shoot anything and everyone from every conceivable angle.<br /><br />In the end, Gibson is able to expose Sloan to Fox, The Gunsmith, and several other Fraternity members. But Sloan counters by revealing that \\"everyone in this room\\" has been earmarked for termination and that if they were going to stand by Gibson's accusations--they shouldfirst turn their own weapons on themselves.<br /><br />As Sloan escapes, Fox complies with her mandate and fires a miracle bullet (this really reminded me of The Warren Commission's theory of a single \\"magic bullet\\" in the John F. Kennedy assassination), which effectively kills everyone in the room except Gibson.<br /><br />Bruised, battered, penniless, and bloodied; Gibson realizes that he has to start out fresh in another accounting job. It is here where Sloan hopes to seek retribution--but not before being set up by Gibson.<br /><br />Wanted, which was loosely based on work of creators (and executive producers) Mark Millar (The Ultimates, The Ultimates 2, and Wanted) J.

B00005JPY0|3.0|Not going to say that the movie wasn't any good, it was very entertaining( a little too long though ). Seriously come on people this movie is only breaking records at the box office do to the death and performance of Heath Ledger as the Joker. Ledger did an amazing job. He completely stole the show. Christian Bale was good when he was Bruce Wayne but when he put on the silly costume and became the Batman things got a little retarded. Like his voice for example. Another complaint that I have is everyone out there comparing this movie to Iron Man. Iron Man was also a very entertaining movie with flaws. Comparing the two is like comparing apples to oranges they are both two totally different types of films. So jump off of the high horse and realize that Heath Ledger is the main reason that The Dark Knight will smash box office records.

0805087184|5.0|We bought this book for my 3y.o. son a couple of days ago and he loves it. Though it is very simple compared to what we usually read (he's a big Seuss fan), the pictures are colorful and very creative, and it's a great introduction to animals and colors. Plus, because of it's simple lines and rhymes, it's easy for him to remember and he likes to \\"read it\\" himself... as he is interested in \\"reading\\" stories to us this is a great experience (with his favorite Seuss books such as The cat in the Hat this is not so easy). I was a bit doubtful about buying this book because he is used to more complex stories, but I'm happy to say that it was a great buy! :-)
0385340567|3.0|I'm not sure what drove Child to publish this book, as is, other than the annual pressure that series' authors get from their publishers to grind out a book a year.<br /><br />It was a great idea to have his action series hero, Jack Reacher return to loner status for this, his 12th outing. Child's won so many fans, he routinely appears in best seller lists with his vigilante hero.<br /><br />I just put \\"Nothing to Lose\\", the 12th book down, and went and washed my mouth out with Listerine. Bad taste. I had a hard time slugging past the chapters in the mid-60's... one of Child's affectations is that he writes short, terse, page and a half chapters, and many of them. This time, I wish he would have found a way to quit, halfway through.<br /><br />Child starts out on a promising note with Jack Reacher, Child's military loner, arriving in a desolate part of part of Colorado, where the small towns are named \\"Hope\\" and \\"Despair\\". He just wants a cup of coffee. Akin to many of the earlier books, sometimes Reacher's mere foreboding presence is enough to get him into trouble. He's arrested for vagrancy and soon learns that he's fallen into \\"a company town\\"... an element that has been used so successfully for hidden evil by so many authors (Stepford Wives being a great trailblazer!)<br /><br />There's a recycling operation controlled by a \\"Mr. Thurman\\" who surrounds himself with a gang of thugs, a surefire way to get Jack sniffing the ground. Enlisted by the female law enforcer of neighboring Hope, (yes, she's the love interest, as well)Reacher begins to bring Thurman's forces down. The villains in this book are a little pathetic, and there's a lot of repetitious trotting back and forth to Despair before Reacher begins to defuse the situation.<br /><br />In addition to some thin characterization, and no feel of real threat or danger, the main problem is that the story is derailed by multiple Lee Child political speeches. Now, since the tide of American feelings turned against Dubya and the war, there have been many, many expressions of political views in film, in song, on TV and in fiction.<br /><br /> However, it is truly out of character, since Child uses Reacher to espouse his own (Child's) political views. Reacher is a consummate military man, who has echoed some ironic thoughts about the military over the years... but to suddenly spew forth in an anti-war staccato -- unforgiveable.<br /><br />It's boring, it's inconsistent, it's a Lee Child rant, not a Jack Reacher rant. What was a 4 star Reacher book, on the basis of plot and action, becomes a 3 star entry, on the basis of an author getting carried away.<br />Series veterans may want to read it, but honestly, I wish I had skipped the installment.een many, many expressions of political views in film, in song, on TV and in fiction.

0694003611|5.0|This was practically the first book I read to my son, from the time he was one month old. It's got a beautiful rythm, and is the perfect length for a first baby book. The story is very simple: a young bunny says good night to everything in his room, which is great so that a baby can first familiarize himself with his surroundings. I've read that some reviewers didn't like the black and white pictures in between the color ones, but I think the alternation (color, b&w, color, and so forth) fits very nicely and is a good way to keep the attention of a very small baby, as well as the change from looking at the whole bedroom to a particular object on each page, which helps the baby learn about context and to focus. Once my son was older, we had lots of fun looking for the mouse in all of the color pictures.     Frankly, I read the poor reviews and I don't agree with those opinions. One of the complaints was that the story was too simple, but I think that they might not be able to see that a very young baby needs a very simple storyline, a month-old baby couldn't follow a more complex story like \\"The cat in the hat\\" for example (which I love, don't get me wrong!!!). I just think that those who reviewed this book poorly can't look through the eyes of a very young baby, or bought it for an older child and of course couldn't understand what all the fuss was about. My son is now 3y.o. and we hardly ever get this book anymore, but I can't wait to be pregnant again to start reading it to another baby...

B000RPTQ1C|5.0|What first drew me to this band was their knack for creating such an atmospheric experience. Call it shoegaze music, call it whatever you want...the band, as a whole, created something unique and totally original with their release of 'Parachutes'. That disc was basically a body part to me for an extended period of time after it's release...and it's still a regular in my cd player.<br /><br />The next albums, while there were definitely noteworthy songs, were a bit of a letdown for me. Chris Martin seemed to take center stage, so I never got the sense of a BAND geling together to create something spectacular and memorable...as they accomplished with 'Parachutes'. Sometimes bands seem to \\"play it safe\\" after such a successful debut album. This was the impression that I got anyway.<br /><br />'Viva La Vida' is a remarkable, well-crafted gem. The musical prowess of every member of the band is witnessed on the entire album. After listening to the haunting opening track, \\"Life In Technicolor\\", I somehow knew this album would be magnificent. It is only an instrumental, but nothing needed to be said. The backing vocals in \\"Cemeteries of London\\" and \\"Death and All His Friends\\" give me goosebumps on each listen. \\"Lovers in Japan/Reign of Love\\" is the best song Coldplay has ever done. As a man, I am not afraid to admit that this song makes my eyes water everytime I listen to it. It is that beautiful. It is that engaging.<br /><br />'Viva La Vida' is not only a return to form, it is a masterpiece.

B000YAA68C|4.0|Gerry and Holly married while they were young and free of worries. Years later they feel the pressure as the reality of marriage and all it entails kicks in. The scene starts off with Gerry (Gerard Butler) and Holly (Hillary Swank) emerging from the subway walking towards their home. The couple is arguing about their different views on life with emphasis on children, money and getting their dream home. The argument heats up to the point where Gerry storms out and quickly rushes back in and they fell in each other's arms and make wild, passionate love.<br /><br />The credit rolls in and the next scene is that of Gerry's wake. The viewers are told that he has died of brain tumour at the young age of 35. The next three weeks see a decline in Holly as we see her spiralling down, crying and watching black and white movies, suffering from hallucinations of her late husband. Then as she sings along to Judy Garland, her mother (Kathy Bates) and best friends (Lisa Kudrow and Gina Gershon) walk in reminding her that it was her 30th birthday. They open a cake from Gerry and Holly thinks it's a prank until they play the accompanying tape recorder where Gerry tells her of his plan for her, how he has written letters which will arrive on various occasions. Those letters become a source of strength for her as she follows his advice and finds herself doing things she would never have thought herself. While Gerry has planned for the letters to serve as a guide for Holly to figure out what she wants in life, they serve as a way for the viewers to find out more about the couple and their beginnings.<br /><br />The tasks include a trip to Ireland where we are treated to a spectacular view of the countryside and Ireland's splendor come to life. Here we see Holly meet another Irishman who turns out to be an old friend of Gerry's. We find out about her first meeting with Gerry and it is one of those moments that make a romantic movie truly heartmelting. Hillary Swank portrays the grieving and lost widow quite well and the supporting characters were good and added some much needed laughter.  The highlight for me though was Gerard Butler who was just truly charming. I think I am now officially a drooling fan. That smile is enough to weaken any woman's knees and any woman would understand how Holly could have fallen in love with a perfect stranger. I thought he was great as King Leonidas in [[ASIN:B000QXDEDG 300 (Full Screen Edition)]] yelling out \\"This is Sparta!\\" in his almost naked glory. But now he has been elevated to real sweetheart material after seeing him in this movie. And God I love a man who can sing.<br /><br />P.S. I LOVE YOU, while far from perfect, is more than your average run-of-the-mill romantic movie.  While I find that the whole letters after death thing lacked plausibility (the cynical may even find it creepy), the idea is simply clever. It provided the sentimentalism that is certain to leave many readers teary and satisfied with the film.quite well and the supporting characters were good and added some much needed laughter.

B0016HNOXQ|4.0|2008 could not have possibly been a better time for me to hear a new Portishead album. My fandom is probably bigger than it's ever been before and the fact that it does not repeat the classic formula via crowd pleasing makes it all the more engaging a listen. And the album doesn't even sound that un-Portishead in the first place. It's possibly not the strongest album they've released yet but there's plenty of quality material to be found here.    And it's not like the songs themselves sound individually the same either. You get \\"We Carry On,\\" possibly their most dancefloor ready song ever. And then it follows right up with the lo-fi field recording sound of \\"Deep Water\\" and the fantastic drum-machine centered \\"Machine Gun,\\" which fits the violent theme of the lyrics just perfectly. It's one of their greatest songs and total brilliance. Also, some of these songs end where they seem like they wouldn't or shouldn't. You expect Gibbons to sing more on \\"Nylon Smile\\" or the music to continue on \\"Silence\\" at first instead of their abrupt endings.    This record is something truly creative and worth investing in if you have any taste for the group. I mean, 11 years really has paid off here! Sure I'd like those traditional trip-hop songs but I think in the end that \\"Third\\" is more rewarding than that ever could have been.
0061245097|4.0|After the bloodbath involving some evil governor and truly wicked vampires, Catherine Crawfield bade goodbye to her human life.  Coerced by the government to join the special unit that hunts down all things paranormal, Special Agent Crawfield continues her work ridding the world of the undead. And as she continues to leave slain vampires in her wake, she has become the fabled Red Reaper - the vampire bogeyman. Now someone wants to stop her at all cost and there is a hefty price on her head. All of a sudden, the night huntress has become the hunted. What's a girl to do when she knows that her only hope could be the very person (er...vampire) that she left behind?<br /><br />Yes, dear readers, old feelings will be reignited and new dangers will be thrown in Cat's path. I knew this and expected this. After all, the ending of [[ASIN:B000W94FU0 Halfway to the Grave]] deliciously suggested this. Indeed, as I finished reading the first book, I was eager to see what happens to Cat after she became a Special Agent and what her reunion would Bones be like. Consequently, I devoured this book in two sittings because I simply had to find out. I will not go through the details for fear of spoiling the whole plot for other readers, but I can assure you that I was delighted by this second installment although not quite as rapt as I was with the first one. I guess my biggest gripe was that we didn't really get to see the early stages of Cat's life as an Agent and the lack of development with the secondary characters, but heck I had such fun reading this book that I can overlook this!<br /><br />Jeaniene Frost provides a fantastic spin on the vampires and ghouls that she creates in her own world of make-believe. ONE FOOT IN THE GRAVE is quick-paced and filled with witticism. Frost injects some romance and sex that is written well-enough to avoid being categorised as smut. The ending hints at further conflict that our heroine will face in the future. And the reader waits to see what Frost has in store for our fabulous half-breed.ore for our fabulous half-breed.
B000J103OI|3.0|The film adaptation for the novel, made this a much more interesting story line, and much more believable than the novel. For those that have read the book, you'll probably like the move better as it's a better story.     The casting for this moving was pretty right on, however the casting for the character Christian seemed way off.  While charming, he was much older and much less attractive than expected - I and found it a little unvbelievable that he would turn Andie's head in any way.  I had actually hoped this character would have a bigger role in the movie based on what I read in the book.  This character could have been removed from the movie and wouldn't have made a different.  Because of the casting, he should have been.    Meryl Streep is fabulous and nails this character perfectly as does Ann Hathaway.  The clothes in the movie are great and it's a great story - just not one of the best movies ever.  I would give it 3.5 stars out of 5.
B00008973A|1.0|I was fortunate enough to see the original Broadway Play and I was captivated by the story line and the fantastic, heart warming characters in the play.  Too bad the Movie Directors and Script Writers had to do a hack job of the play by changing the plot, changing character plots, and adding way too much to the story and settings.     When will they ever learn that if a Broadway Play is a huge success like \\"A Chorus Line\\" was, you don't mess with it and destroy the whole meaning of the play and its characters?  This Movie was a complete disaster.  It changed the entire story line, shifting the attention off the the dancers as were meant to be, to making it all about the love between Casey and the Casting Director.      They even screwed up the MAIN song in the play, \\"What I did for Love\\" and that truly angered me.  What she did for love was DANCE!!!  By changing the story line and plot, from her love of dancing, to her love for the Casting Director, it changed the whole meaning of the song and as far as I'm concerned, destroyed the Movie.     Wait till the Broadway Play comes to a city near you and even if you have to buy the nose bleed seats, it's well worth it just to see the play as it was meant to be see!!!!
B00000FCBC|5.0|I thought that this was a great buy especially considering it gave me a better idea of where one of the greatest bands drew its inspiration.  Everything from folk style songs (e.g. Whiskey in a Jar, Turn the Page, and Tuesday's Gone) to wupass heavy songs (e.g. So What, Am I Evil, Blitzkrieg) to the excellent cover of Queen's \\"Stone Cold Crazy\\" are all some of the great variety you can see here.  Many complain that Metallica became sellouts for ditching their traditional thrash, but I think this goes to show that they wanted to become more accessible by crunching human stories into some of their later work instead of singing constantly about revenge, death, and chaos like countless other metal acts.<br /><br />Though the first disk has the more recent songs that vear into the style of \\"Load\\" and \\"Reload,\\" the second disk contains all the B-sides and covers from their earlier career as is noticeable by James' higher vocal range.  I think there is a little bit of everything to get a taste of from this set for anyone with an open mind.
B0019FOC5E|4.0|I Saw Mamma Mia today and LOVED IT!!!!!!! I saw the stage show as well about 6 yrs ago. The movie just adds another dimensoin to the story. Meryl was excellent so was ammanda. The singing wasnt as bad  from the guys end as people have written..This isnt a stage show its a movie and its makes it more real when they dont have the best singing voices. This movie had heart.. I got teared up a couple times especially when meryl belts out \\"Winner takes it all\\" WOW>>>>. I was disappointed that the soundtrack is missing a few key numbers from the film so I amwondering if they will release another version with the added tracks and maybe some of the instrumental tracks. I highly recomend this film..It was a toe tapping, dancing in the aisles good time.
0316067601|5.0|I have read many books on or about the Navy Seals, some better than others.  Quite often I don't finish the books as they are poorly written or just get plain boring.  This is by far the best Seal book ever written.  In fact I put this up with \\"Marine Sniper: 93 Confirmed Kills\\" as the top 2 books ever written about our soldiers.    Everything in this book was relevant.  Many books on Seals stray off on several side notes.  This book does stray a few times on how to becomes a Seal, Marcus' background etc. but it all ties together very well.    The background story about how to become a Seal was short and precise.  Like I said earlier I have read about this process many times but I learned new things about the process in this book that wasn't covered in all the others I've read.    Then when you get to the mission it gets incredible.  I won't give anything away but it gets action packed.  Some of these men gave their lives for us and I think this book does a wonderful job letting the world know of their heroism and sacrifices they made for our country.      I highly recommend this book to anyone
0440241413|5.0|Loved this Shopaholic book from beginning to end.  Rebecca Bloomwood is a great character to follow through these stories.

0385338724|5.0|You've just won the Publishers' Clearing House sweepstakes only you don't remember! Just imagine it, waking up one day and discovering that your entire world has changed. Imagine your life now with all its routines and traditions and then imagine three years from now. How different could things possibly be? What if you suddenly woke up today and three years had passed and you were a new person, with a new life, and you had no remembrance, no understanding of the sudden transition. Imagine, if you will, taking on this new dream life, only to later realize that all is not well in the world but you have no way of providing a solution because you don't remember the all important transition. How weird and fascinating would such an experience be? How exhilarating and how terrifying would it be to attain your dream life filled with scads of money, friends, and a handsome multimillionaire husband? Lexi Smart, a formerly underpaid employee at the none too glamorous Deller Carpets is about to find out. After being denied a promotion, being stood up by her boyfriend, and discovering that her father has died, Lexi's world just seems to be going downhill, until a fateful accident occurs that she can't remember. Suddenly, Lexi wakes up in a hospital, the last three years obliterated from her mind, to discover that her most recent memory is actually long since passed and that her world has changed drastically since the Deller Carpets days. She is wealthy beyond her wildest dreams, with an equally wealthy husband, a high profile job, and a new set of swank friends. But, is this world as alluring as it first appears, or is there a seam of cracks beneath the shallow surface? The answer to the riddle lies buried in Lexi's memory, but will her amnesia ever leave her? Will Lexi ever be able to find her true self again, or has all the wealth and glamour killed the old, high spirited Lexi of yesteryear? So remember, be careful what you wish for. You just might get it.<br /><br />Sophie Kinsella has once again presented a hilarious, yet ultimately serious and sentimental tale for the reader's enjoyment. Although Kinsella has never penned an inferior novel, Remember Me stands dramatically above all her pervious works. As an author she has developed and expanded her level of emotional and romantic depth, presenting a tale that is both unique and realistic at the same time. While the idea of amnesia has been more than properly explored in both television and grocery store romances, Kinsella has really done her homework, taking the concept away from its clich&eacute;d origins by adding a realistic emotional dimension. The basis of the story is actually believable and surprisingly enthralling, grabbing the reader's interest instantly and refusing to let go. Because of this cleverly structured plot, the entire tale has a distinct air of the unpredictable, which is unusual for Kinsella since the public of readers mostly takes it for granted that her character will, after numerous tragedies and hilarious mishaps, have a happily ever after ending.<br /><br />Likewise, Kinsella's new character is just as lovable as Becky Bloomwood in the much loved Shopaholic series. Lexi is a believable and down to earth character whose spunky personality is being crushed by the unfeeling, no nonsense world of business and high finance. We love Lexi both for her romanticism and her forced practicality and, above all else, for her vivid interpretation of emotions that we have all been subjected to. Her description of Loser Dave, her odious boyfriend, will bring chuckles to the readers' hearts, as we all secretly stand behind her, remembering those Loser Daves that we were saddled with. Her clumsiness in her new ultra modern home will remind us of those times at friends' houses when we have accidentally toppled something irreplaceable and ghastly expensive. Lexi is vivid and bright, lovable and laughable, and, above all, just like us. Life rains on her parade, just like it rains on ours and, just like us, she regretfully keeps picking herself up and moving on.<br /><br />Lexi's character is supported, nurtured, and conversely deprived by an equally fleshed out cast of background characters and friends including her whippet crazy mother, her con artist blue-haired sister, her multimillionaire husband, and one other special character. These characters are just as alive and vivid as Lexi, each with their own believable personality forcing the reader to form bonds of love and hate, enmeshing him or her even deeper into the unfolding drama.<br /><br />Unlike most of Kinsella's previous offerings, Remember Me is never slightly predictable. The conclusion is satisfying, startlingly realistic, and, most important, suitably sentimental. While the happily ever after element is present, it does bow to life's little cruelties as well as producing a well rounded conclusion that the reader would never have predicted. Remember Me is most certainly a novel that the reader will \\"remember\\" after the last page has fluttered into place.<br /><br />But, Kinsella's concentration on the emotional and dramatic does not diminish her penchant for the comedic. The dialogue was witty and charged with sarcasm and the circumstances that Lexi found herself in were fraught with physical comedy unrivaled by the Three Stooges. Her mishaps in her new high tech home, her run ins with her mother's pack of pet dogs, and her budding relationship with her new, and somewhat strange husband, all culminate to keep the story continually bouncing from one outrageously side splitting dilemma into another all the while retaining the novel's bittersweet edge.<br /><br />In creating her masterpiece, Kinsella expertly weaves the tale together with a witty, tongue in cheek writing style that backs the comedic aura. The unfolding tale relies entirely on Lexi's mental narration. Through her eyes, the story unravels blending modern language with vivid descriptiveness and a surprising understanding of the inner workings of the mind. By using this method of character narration, the entire work encapsulates a down to earth aura, making the reader feel as though he or she has a direct connection to Lexi's thought process, instead of feeling as though the tale is merely being narrated by an omnipotent, detached being. This style is highly effective and is the final touch to a grand masterpiece.<br /><br />Conclusion: Kinsella has an almost magical way of appealing to modern audiences, using clever language, unique circumstances, and a down to earth appeal to people's emotions that never fails. Kinsella combines everything that makes a tale truly great and presents the reader with a modern drama of epic proportions. So, in acknowledgment of the novel, the only way to truly conclude is to ask the all important question: What would you really do if you won the Publishers' Clearing House sweepstakes and forgot?<br /><br />- Ravenovat like us, she regretfully keeps picking herself up and moving on.

0316113506|2.0|The first chapter was exciting but it was downhill from there.  I agree with the reviewer who said it would make a good magazine article.  Exercise is good for the brain - said over and over - became less and less interesting as the book went on.
B00005JPY0|5.0|The Dark Knight- everything that's been said about the sequel is true...This is one superhero movie that lives up to its hype...    As the film opens, a mysterious criminal known only as the Joker (Heath Ledger) robs a mob-owned Gotham bank, and double crosses his accomplices so that he can have all the money. That night, multiple Batman impersonators interrupt a meeting between mobsters and the Scarecrow (Cillian Murphy). The real Batman (Christian Bale) shows up and puts a quick end to the mallee .    Batman and Lieutenant James Gordon (Gary Oldman) decide to being in newly elected district attorney Harvey Dent (Aaron Eckhart) in on their plan to eradicate the mob, with the possibility that Dent will become the hero to the people that Batman cannot be. At the same time, Bruce Wayne and Harvey are both competing for the love of Rachel Dawes (Maggie Gyllenhaal).    The mob bosses meet to discuss how to handle Batman, Gordon, and Dent, while a Chinese mobster accountant, Lau (Chin Han), lets the gang leaders know he has taken their money to Hong Kong to prevent the police and the district attorney from seizing it in an imminent bank raid.    The Joker arrives at the meeting and proposes to kill Batman for them, convincing them that Lau will give them all up to the police if he is caught...    When fellow filmmaker Kevin Smith called TDK the Heat of the comic book film genre-he wasn't exaggerating...Director Christopher Nolan breaks new ground for the comic book film here.    Creating one of the most sophisticated and intricate films of its kind ever produced. The script lays out the struggle between good and evil in such a way as to make it seem fresh--without being obvious and cliched. The script from Nolan and his brother Jonathan is just top notch reminding me once again why I love their work--they don't try to dumb things down for the sake of the viewer--taking them for granted. Even though we're dealing with a few fantastic characters who do fanciful things. Theworld of TDK is grounded in reality--Thanks in no small part to the performances...    Bale's Batman/Bruce Wayne continues to impress-giving us reason to see him truly the way he was created...complex and tortured....    Meanwhile, Ledger is superb as the Joker-dialing down the over the top-ness of say Jack Nicholson from Batman of nearly 20 years ago (which fit the tone of that film and the times) and instead as a maniac could send a chill through you without saying a word. With a manipulation of his vocal inflection--Ledger's clown prince is quite creepy...    Is it Oscar-worthy? I say Yes...    Gyllenhaal's Rachel is miles ahead of the way that Katie Holmes played her in Batman Begins. While Eckhart is a perfect fit as Dent...Oldman, Morgan Freeman as Fox and Michael Caine as Alfred offer able support as always.    The film boasts a spectacular cycle/car/truck chase and a nifty aerial stunt...The story indeed may offer some viewers a few unexpected twists and the set-up is there for a third film...    And while Ledger's death earlier this year was tragic, the movie will forever stand as a reminder of what an actor could do in a \\"comic book movie\\" to help make it great...    I can't wait to see TDK again...!

0345495004|5.0|\\"Loving Frannk\\" is a fascinating and well-written book that is a true story presented as a novel. I could not put it down. I was only vaguely familiar about FLW & Mamah's love affair and I had no idea how their story unfolded before reading this book. I found the period history about the women's movement around the world very interesting. The moral dilemmas Mamah faced in the early 1900's about marriage, children, career, true love, etc. are not unlike the ones women face today. This is a must read book!!

0756404746|5.0|I happened to grab this book off the shelf randomly while stocking up on reading material for a business trip and ended up calling in sick to sit at my hotel and read it. It's epic fantasy in the style of George Martin, Robin Hobb, and Terry Goodkind with a twist of Rowling thrown in. Believably deep characters, a unique system of magic, and flowing narrative make this a must read. The only downside is that the rest of the story hasn't been published yet, but there is a publication schedule in place for the next two parts.
0452289963|5.0|Eckhart Tolle's THE POWER OF NOW was one of the most<br />powerful books I have read in the past several years . . . it helped<br />me appreciate the joy of living \\"in the now.\\"<br /><br />His latest effort, A NEW EARTH,<br />goes beyond what he wrote previously to show why it is necessary<br />to transcend our ego-based consciousness if we truly want<br />personal happiness . . . also, by so doing, Tolle contends that we<br />will awaken life's purpose.<br /><br />Tolle, a contemporary spiritual teacher, is not easy to get \\"into\\"<br />for some readers . . . yet if you make the effort, you will find<br />yourself drawn into what he has to say by his use of some<br />very thought-provoking observations--such as this one:<br /><br />* As I was walking with a friend through a beautiful nature reserve<br />near Malibu in California, we came upon the ruins of what had been<br />once a country house, destroyed by a fire several decades ago. As we<br />approached the property, long overgrown with trees and all kinds<br />of magnificent plants, there was a sign by the side of the trail put there<br />by the park authorities. It read: DANGER. ALL STRUCTURES ARE<br />UNSTABLE. I said to my friend, \\"That's a profound sutra [sacred scripture].\\"<br />And we stood there in awe. Once you realize and accept that all<br />structures (forms) are unstable, even the seemingly solid material ones,<br />peace arises within you. This is because the recognition of the<br />impermanence of all forms awakens you to the dimension of the formless<br />within yourself, that which is beyond death. Jesus called it \\"eternal life.\\"<br /><br />I then read a few more pages before I came across this equally<br />interesting passage that summed up how I often feel:<br /><br />* I usually congratulate people when they tell me, \\"I don't know<br />who I am anymore.\\" Then they look perplexed and ask, \\"Are you saying<br />it is a good thing to be confused?\\" I ask them to investigate. What does<br />it mean to be confused? \\"I don't know\\" is not confusion. Confusion is:<br />\\"I don't know, but I should know\\" or \\"I don't know, but I need to know.\\"<br />Is it possible to let go of the belief that you should or need to know who<br />you are? In other words, can you cease looking to conceptual definitions<br />to give you a sense of self? Can you cease looking to thought for an identity?<br />When you let go of the belief that you should or need to know who you are,<br />what happens to confusion? Suddenly it is gone. When you fully accept that<br />you don't know, you actually enter a state of peace and clarity that is closer<br />to who you truly are than thought could ever be. Defining yourself through<br />thought is limiting yourself.<br /><br />Lastly, I liked how he often used stories to drive points home:<br /><br />* The inability or rather unwillingness of the human mind to let go of the<br />past is beautifully illustrated in the story of two Zen monks, Tanzan and<br />Ekido, who were walking along a country road that had become<br />extremely muddy after heavy rains. Near a village, they came upon<br />a young woman who was trying to cross the road, but the mud was<br />so deep it would have ruined the silk kimono she was wearing. Tanzan<br />at once picked her up and carried her to the other side.<br /><br />The monks walked on in silence. Five hours later, as they were<br />approaching the lodging temple, Ekido couldn't restrain himself any longer.<br />\\"Why did you carry that girl across the road?\\" he asked. \\"We monks are<br />not supposed to do things like that.\\"<br /><br />\\"I put the girl down hours ago,\\" said Tanzan. \\"Are you still carrying her?\\"<br /><br />Now imagine what life would be like for someone who lived like Ekido<br />all the time, unable or unwilling to let go internally of situations,<br />accumulating more and more \\"stuff\\" inside, and you get a sense<br />of what life is like for the majority of people on our planet. What a heavy<br />burdenof past they carry around with them in their minds.<br /><br />Read A NEW EARTH if you're in the mood for something a bit out<br />of the ordinary, but in a very positive way . . . it will make you<br />think about what's written on almost every page, then want to<br />go back to revisit it . . .

B0016Q56C4|4.0|By definition, what you like or enjoy is subjective.  Whether or not something is of a certain quality is more debatable.  In between, lands films like this that you can enjoy quite a bit while readily admitting it might be one of the dumber films you've ever watched.  I would not dare debate the artistic quality of this film other than the stunning visuals and appropriate acting.  At the heart of most film is the story.  This story is so stupid and full of nonsense, that enjoying it automatically falls in the \\"Guilty Pleasure\\" category, only without the guilt.  Let's quickly chop it up to make this clear.<br /><br />-OH SO STUPID!!<br />This film has so many scientific inaccuracies, so gleefully digs enormous plot holes, so often defies probabilities, so boldly slaps the face of logic and so blatantly ignores physics that suspension of disbelief is nearly forced upon you; \\"Don't even START to believe ANY of this!!!\\" the film makers seam to be shouting.  I accepted this like the sugar coated pill that it is.  Even with the stupidity, the concept was actually pretty cool; Jules Vern was using REAL sources.  My biggest complaint is they spent too much time developing a back story and a prelude to the action.  Even though those aspects weren't poorly thought out, it actually detracted from the bold stupidity of the rest of the film.<br /><br />-I LIKE BRENDAN FRASER<br />Here's a guy who currently is really good at only one thing; playing the capable yet imperfect, attractive but not handsome, intelligent yet simple, irritating but admired, reluctant but heroic \\"everyman\\".  Talk about type-casting!!!  Other than his cartoon adaptations (bad ideas to begin with), I can't think of one film he's done that I haven't enjoyed a lot.  Whether it was \\"Bedazzled\\" or \\"The Mummy\\" series, I always feel good after watching his movies.  He really has a talent for acting like we think we would (or at least WISH we would) if put in the same situations.  The other actors didn't hurt this film either.<br /><br />-LIKE A DISNEY 3D ATTRACTION<br />If you've ever been to any of the Disney theme parks, you've probably seen a 3D attraction of some sort (Honey, we Shrunk the Audience\\" comes to mind).  Well, if you have, that is what this film is like for one and a half hours.  Anyway, needless to say, it's extremely cool regardless of the films inherent problems.  My kids were reaching for stuff coming out of the screen and my wife jumped out of her skin a couple times; a real thrill ride.  A lot of screams and giggles occurred throughout the audience.  As most have stated; without 3D this film is rather pointless but still ok.<br /><br />-SET PIECE HEAVEN<br />After the initial (boring) set up, the film progresses from one cool and silly set piece to another.  Each scene plays out almost like a video game;<br />-Confront strange new environment.<br />-Solve the puzzle/beat the challenge.<br />-Move to the next set piece.<br />I have to say, this made it all a lot of fun without ever challenging your brain; sometimes its fun to turn your brain off.<br /><br />-RECOMMENDATION<br />This is the first time I took my son to a film where he shouted out \\"That was AWESOME!!!\\" after a scene.  Though shamefully derivative and sometime scary, my kids absolutely loved it.  My wife and I had fun despite the unparalleled suspension of disbelief.  I would put this in a similar category with the original \\"Tomb Raider\\" film; a turn your brain off thrill ride.  The big difference is that this one is even less probable yet more family friendly.<br /><br />-story...2.5 stars<br />-visuals.5 stars<br />-Acting..4 stars<br />-Fun.....5 stars<br /><br />Average...4 StarsA DISNEY 3D ATTRACTION  If you've ever been to any of the Disney theme parks, you've probably seen a 3D attraction of some sort (Honey, we Shrunk the Audience\\" comes to mind).

B0010V4TZU|5.0|This album is wonderful: In the car, at the gym, prepping for a day/night out, at a party, on the go, etc. Get the picture? It's fresh, fun, witty and all over fantastic. Some of the best tracks are A-Punk, Oxford Comma, M79, and Walcott. The upbeat sound and catchy lyrics are paired with an original voice and perspective. I highly recommend it.
B00000099Y|5.0|The musical aspects of Ænima and the ritual \\"file under exercise**\\" have already been well-covered in the other reviews here.  I'll cover an angle that I have never before read about this CD.    When mixing a record, it is common practice to bring in recordings of other songs, sounds, or whatever to use as references and / or \\"ear-cleaners\\".    This CD has become (for me at least) a Golden-Standard.  The sound on it is SO well-produced that it serves as landmark; it not only sets a standard against which other works are measured, it is also like a lighthouse for those mixing new works.  It helps one maintain or regain one's bearings in frequency-space.      ** the comparison of one band to other bands such to allow those who know the music to market it to those who don't.
B0019EXZY4|5.0|\\"The Bank Job\\" stretches the truth of the 1971 heist of Lloyd's Baker Street Bank in London into a smart, entertaining political thriller. Ex-model Martine Love (Saffron Burrows) is having a fling with MI5 bureaucrat Tim Everett (Richard Lintern) when she lands in hot water over a drug charge. In exchange for her freedom, Martine convinces some old friends that the safe deposit vault at Lloyd's is ripe for the picking. Terry (Jason Statham) is a slightly shady car dealer with a history of small-time crime and a shine for Martine. Kevin (Stephen Campbell Moore) is a photographer ex-boyfriend, and Dave (Daniel Mays) and old pal. Together, they plot and execute a £4 million heist, but, unbeknownst to the thieves, the real danger lies in the secrets, not the money, that the safe deposit boxes hold.<br /><br />\\"The Bank Job\\" is a blend of fact, speculation, fabrication, and real events that have been connected in a highly speculative fashion. The bank robbery did happen more or less as presented, but there was apparently a D-notice issued by MI5 several days later that forbid the press from speaking further of the crime for reasons of national security. Even stranger, the thieves were eventually caught, convicted, and served prison sentences, but all in secret. Their names have never been revealed. Because no one knows who they are, the characters in the movie are fictional. The real robbery was certainly not orchestrated by MI5, who need only present a warrant if they want access to a safe deposit box, but the agency does seem to have taken an interest after the fact. The idea that photos of a frolicking royal were at the heart of the matter is based on secondhand information, and speculation about a connection to Michael Abdul Malik is due to his having a box in that Lloyd's vault.<br /><br />The \\"based on a true story\\" tag in the movie's logo is misleading, but there were some strange and bewildering aspects to the Lloyd's Baker Street Bank robbery which remain mysterious to this day. \\"The Bank Job\\" takes the speculation, ties it all together with some pure fiction, and creates a top-notch political thriller with great 1970s period atmosphere. It's all very cynical toward government and law enforcement, and, in that way, perhaps it reflects the mood in 1971 and 2008 as well. Honorable thieves, corrupt cops, hypocritical security services and politicians, raunchy royals, sex, violence, greed, sleaze...this movie packs it all into a tight, suspenseful package. I'm surprised \\"The Bank Job\\" didn't do better at the box office. With plenty of intrigue and thrills, i's the best movie I've seen so far in 2008.<br /><br />The DVD (Lions Gate 2008 single disc): The single disc edition includes 2 featurettes, a feature commentary, and a theatrical trailer. \\"Inside the Bank Job\\" (16 min) is a making-of documentary that interviews director Roger Donaldson, writers Ian Le Frenais and Dick Clement, producers, cast, and some crew about the film's tone, locations, production design, story, and the large cast. \\"The Baker Street Bank Raid\\" (15 min) is about the real robbery. The ham radio operator who picked up the thieves' transmission is interviewed, as well as some historians, journalists about the robbery and the suspicious aspects of the case. There is a feature commentary by director Donaldson, actress Saffron Burrows, and composer J. Peter Robinson. It's a constant commentary but not very focused or informative.

B00005JPY0|4.0|I went to see The Dark Knight on opening night with my husband (who is the ultimate Batman fan) a little apprehensive because I grew up loving the original Tim Burton Batman which covered the same period in the Batman saga as \\"The Dark Knight.\\"  I was thoroughly engaged by this movie (and I usually don't love action films).  It was visually stunning, darker than Burton's, and at times, edge of your seat intense.<br /><br />Heath Ledger's Joker is much darker and scarier than Jack Nicholson's, and the movie as a whole was much darker and less cartoon like.  In all Ledger really steals the film--you can't take your eyes off of him when he's on film.  The Joker is truly terrifying--when he torments his prey it is horror film intense.  Christian Bale is a cool, collected Batman, and Maggie Gyllenhaal is a suitable love interest.  I really enjoyed Aaron Eckhardt as Harvey Dent and wish the movie hadn't turned out the way it did for his character.  In all the action sequences were mesmerizing, although I did feel like the movie went on about 30 minutes too long, and the last action sequence was very, very long.<br /><br />I would recommend this movie if you've ever enjoyed a Batman movie, and are open to seeing a new interpretation of this classic character.  I enjoyed the movie even though it differed from the Batman of my youth.  I would also recommend this to anyone who enjoys action films--since it's likely to be the best one out this summer!
B0014XCMVM|5.0|What a great CD - the lyrics are included - which I like.  Alanis hit it out of the park on this one.  She's moved on to speaking for all of us hurt by men to speaking for the planet and mankind hurt by war and pollution.  Good for her!!!  I love the first song - Citizen of the Planet - had to get a t-shirt so I could wear it proudly when I go see her.
0307237702|3.0|I am not into politics but since there is too much at stake to today I decided that should read as much as I could about the candidates running for the higher office of this country.  I found the ideas and overall content of this book very refreshing but the chapter that had the most impact on me is the one about family.  It is a good book to read and to get Barack's side of his story and not to just take what the media and the Youtube presents to us.
0440238609|5.0|I first was introduced to this trilogy by a friend that had the audiobooks.  It was a fantastic story that kept me on the edge of my seat.  The characters are full of life and the story is jam packed full of excitement. If you want a story that will take you to other worlds and draw you into them, check this one out!
B00005JPY0|5.0|I never liked any Batman movie, and always tells people to go to the Batman animations to get a true vision of the Dark Knight.<br /><br />Then I discovered director Christopher Nolan watching Memento on the big screen.<br /><br />My passion for the director's works grew in every movie I saw.<br /><br />Then I was told he was doing Batman Begins. I went to see it in the very first day and had no words to say how grateful I was for Nolan because of his wonderful work.<br /><br />Now I went on the very first day to see The Dark Knight, after following the whole viral campaign on the web, full of expectations, the best ones.<br /><br />And in the end I was delighted with joy and tears in my eyes!!<br /><br />My childhood and youth hero, Batman finally got his ultimate rendition on the big screen!<br /><br />Bale, Oldman, Caine, Murphy, all of them returned. Ledger was unbelievable like the Joker!! OSCAR FOR HIM!!!! And God bless his soul for his magic!!<br /><br />See? No laughing gas, no guns with bang flags and no chemical white skin here. I didn't miss any of it a bit! Ledger is the definitive Joker! Nicholson appears to be a poor clown for childrens' birthday parties near him. The trick here is to make pencils disappear.<br /><br />You know what? The Dark Knight have only one real problem, a huge one: it'll be very, very, massively difficult to make something better than this for the character.<br /><br />This and Begins are, without any shadow of doubt, the definitive, the ultimate Batman renditions on the movies!<br /><br />Thank you, Nolan brothers, truly, with all my heart!!! You will never know how happy you made me!!

B0019FOC5E|5.0|Two girlfriends and I went to see MAMMA MIA! last night.  We thought it superb!  Magnificent!  Entertaining to the hilt.  Loved every minute of this movie, and the soundtrack definitely needs to be sung and danced to every day. :)
B000VWYJ86|5.0|Just saw this movie this past weekend.      I thought it was one of all time great chase movies.  Reminded me of the French Connection in several places because of the great photography of the chase scenes with great location shooting throughout Europe.    The movie starts with little exposition.  If you watch the extra on filming in Berlin first, it explains that this movie starts 5 minutes after the second movie ended.  I had not seen the second movie in several years.    More of a chase movie than a plot movie, but I thought it was fantastic.
0061020710|5.0|This is the first book I've ever reviewed.  It was funny yet insightful in all the right places.  In fact, I've gone on to buy all the rest of the Discworld books as well.  Enjoy!

B001AMVN3U|5.0|I've been a casual fan of the Offspring since the '90s. They always have some sort of song on each album that's got some widespread appeal just because of the humor they inject into their music. This is only the second full album of theirs I've bought, and I'm very happy with it. I was looking for something that had a good beat throughout so that I could run to it, and it fit the bill perfectly. I think there's one song that's a little slower, but not by much. The songs are good and they totally take me out of the torture I'm putting myself through. Bottom line, if you like the Offspring, get this. If you're just here looking for something with a good beat, get it. If you're looking for easy listening, move along, there's nothing to see here.

B000UBMWG4|5.0|Well, after having purchased Blade Runner in several of it's previous formats (VHS, DVD, DVD Directors Cut) I never thought I would buy it again.  However, when this special became available, I knew that I would have to see this visionary masterpiece playing on my PS3.  I have not been disappointed.  The digital quality is amazing, and it's interesting to watch the movie in it's various versions.  You can actually decide which you prefer, as deleted scenes and voice overs do change the tone significantly.  Also, the question \\"Is Deckard a Replicant?\\" is unequivocally answered by uber director Ridley Scott.
B000UR9T8C|5.0|This movie is the best of the series (a couple notches better than two, but WAAAY better than one). Spider-Man finally gets the girl, thinks about marriage and seems overall happier. He and Mary J. get in a fight in the beginning because she accuses Peter of being insensitive to her Broadway performance critique. Their relationship is kinda up and down throughout. Some really shocking things happen during the course of the movie and it must be known that of all 3 of the movies with McQuire portraying Parker this has the most depth; an intriguing depth that the other two lack. But let me tell you; the trilogy of Spider-Man went out with a serious bang with this movie. It might not be perfect but as far as the series goes it's an all-time high. The action was really good and I disagree when I hear people say that three enemies was too much. Finally, the last few scenes rocked! They were very emotive and if you're sensitive, prepare for some tears.<br /><br />Now I know many have said that there were some issues with this movie but I didn't find too many. It gets really intense at times and you just feel for the characters involved but it really works in the movie's favor. There were also more than a couple of totally light-hearted scenese that balance the more serious matters at hand (Peter's raggedy apartment door, anyone??). This is definitely my favorite superhero movie of all-time after watching it again today (10/11/12). I can't believe I haven't been re-watching it over and over again as it is way better than some have let on. I say if you have any doubts about the series and haven't seen any because you've been put off for any reason, you owe it to yourself to watch one Spider-Man title -- and you'd make the right choice if this was it!<br /><br />4.75 stars.
B0015XASFS|5.0|Josh Groban has done what some artists can never do: put out a concert CD/DVD that's almost better than the studio version. It's one thing to hear this talented young man, but then to watch him -- pure bliss. I had to go back to the original CD to figure out what was different. Groban only gets better.
0618680004|5.0|Professor Dawkins compares and contrasts all theories and \\"proofs\\" of an existence of a higher being. Using the scientific perspective he voids all arguments pointed out by theists and creationists. Awesome book and I highly recommend it!
0060765380|2.0|This book is on a short list of books that I not only did not finish but threw away as to not pass onto someone else.  When one of the characters who was away from his family compared his attachment to his wife and new child as three people sharing an umbilical cord, I felt reader doom early on and should have stopped reading.    Simply put, the cover is better than the story.  It seems made up rather than real, historically accurate and interesting.  I know it's not historically accurate but it should at least pretend as such.      You don't get to really know and care about most of the characters.  Too much \\"tell\\" rather than \\"show.\\"  Rollins likes to use branded products in his writing instead of showing what is going on or the objects used and why they matter.  While I wanted to finish reading this story because I've invested half of a book in it, I can't finish it.  Maybe his other stuff is better.  I probably won't read him again.
B000WGWQG8|5.0|This video jumpstarted interest in this period in American history in our homeschooled 17-year-old, and started mom and dad re-reading the McCollough book around which it is framed. We found it mostly true to the historical account with some small allowance made for the exigencies of movie-making. A few scenes might need to be skipped over for of younger kids at parents' discretion. One really feels a part of the times when watching. It was very difficult not to watch in one sitting! A real \\"page-turner\\" (or disk changer?)! We found the casting right on target, and the casting of George Washington seemed nothing less than amazing.
0060012358|5.0|If you're familiar with Terry Pratchett's work, this is every bit as good as the best. For those who don't yet know the joys of Discworld, this is a great book to start with. It does take place in the Pratchett universe, but it's much more stand-alone than many of his books. Thoughtful, exciting, and -- above all -- hilarious!

B000NIWI9K|4.0|I hate to be the sole dissenter, but I don't think this is a five-star production. It has much to recommend it, mostly the splendid performance by Miah Persson as Fiordiligi. She navigates with great beauty and expression the two wickedly difficult arias that Mozart gave his soprano. The acting is also exceptionally strong in this production. Finally, the filming with an HD camera makes it the best looking opera I own on DVD.<br /><br />But, other than Persson, I found the singing to be just average. One example. In performing the heavenly tenor aria, \\"Un' aura amorosa,\\" Topi Lehtipuu hits all the notes, but he doesn't put his heart and soul into this most moving of love songs. (Compare his performance to that of Shawn Mathey on the 2005 Aix-en-Province \\"Cosi\\" on DVD; Mathey's \\"Un' aura amorosa,\\" can bring tears to your eyes.)<br /><br />It was a odd characteristic of the performances in this Glyndebourne production: with the exception of Miah Persson, the acting was more engaged and expressive than the singing. But If you liked Persson as Susanna in the recently released Covent Garden DVD of \\"Marriage of Figaro,\\" you are in for a real treat here. She truly shines as Fiordiligi (and is given so much more to sing than Susanna!).

0316067601|5.0|The story was so riveting that I couldn't put it down.  I often wonder why people read fiction books when real heroism, such as that displayed by Marcus and his lost comrades, is so much more interesting.  When Marcus writes about his training, it gives you an appreciation of just how dedicated and tough one has to be to get through it.  Once the story of the mission begins, I just had to see what happens next and how it all turns out.  Although Marcus' take on liberals and the press may seem a little harsh, the truth hurts.  Marcus and Patrick Robinson have written a great war story with real heroes.  These are real American heroes that have done incredible things.  Unfortunately, these stories are only rarely told and we don't hear enough about the heroism of our soldiers, sailors and airmen.
B000KKPN5C|3.0|Before I purchased my Nikon D80, I was a Canon-ophile. It took many months of research and thinking before I decided to abandon Canon in favor of Nikon. I am not disappointed with the Nikon D80 nor the Nikkor lenses I bought. I even have the vertical grip that comes in handy. What I can complain about though, is this little flash.     It is true that it is small and looks very cute sitting on top of the camera. The flash tube pivots up with click-stops so that it is easy to get a specific bounce angle. Mine even came with a nicely padded fitted case. The problem I had was that this tiny flash quickly sucks batteries dry.     This flash uses two AA sized batteries. At first I used the rechargeable Nickel-metal-hydride (NiMh) but they didn't last too long--only about 35 flashes (they were new and fully charged). I switched to Alkaline and got about 40 then the recycle time kept getting longer and longer and longer. I supposed if I switched to Lithium batteries I'd get more flashes, but they are too expensive right now.     If you are trying to capture the spontaneity of a party or of little kids being their adorable selves, then this flash will let you down. For the odd snapshot where everyone will stand still until the flash recharges then I suppose it it ok.    I think a better bet would be the SB-600, SB-800 or the new SB-900 for more serious flash work. Both the SB-800 and the SB-900 provide auto-focus assistance that this flash doesn't.    For casual flash photography, this unit works ok. Anything else, save up and buy a better flash. (I know I am.)

B0000067L4|3.0|...when it is remastered by the chucklehead who did \\"Goodbye\\" by Cream (the latest remaster). Don't get me wrong this is a fine album and unlike some people here, I feel that the trio of studio tracks demonstrated continued growth for the band. Eric Clapton and George Harrison's \\"Badge\\" features a sublime melody for the chorus and Harrison himself reused the bridge of the song (which is how it got its title--Clapton read \\"bridge\\" as \\"Badge\\")for \\"Here Comes the Sun\\" for The Beatles' \\"Abbey Road\\" (in fact all of the guitar playing up until the solo is Harrison playing rhythm guitar). Jack Bruce and Peter Brown's \\"Doing That Scrapyard Thing\\" is wonderfully eccentric and points to the direction of his second solo album (although it was released first--confused? So were fans!)\\"Songs for A Taylor\\" and Ginger Baker checks in with one of his most accomplished songs the tense \\"What A Bringdown\\" closing out the album.<br /><br />What's really interesting are the live cuts that open the album. All three feature Cream at the top of their game and compliment the other live tracks from \\"Wheels of Fire\\", \\"Live Cream Volumes 1 & 2\\". In fact I personally feel that these are among the strongest live cuts that the band committed to record (along with \\"Live Cream II\\")but your milage may vary.<br /><br />This remaster sounds a bit shrill, harsh and compressed to me. If you can find an original first CD issue go with that or as another choice the Mofi Gold Edition (which isn't the best one admittedly but it's pretty darn good--Mofi did not use the original mastertapes as they couldn't locate them for this title when Mofi remastered it). Both are better than the latest CD editions that have been littering the stores. The music is the most important part of course but also keep in mind HOW it is presented in terms of sound also can be important as well.
B000002OZY|5.0|Before \\"Tommy\\" The Who was just another band like The Beatles who were your typical 60's pop group, once this album hit they evolved from those 3 minute song rockers to the complex, progressive artists driven by Townshend's power lyrics and Daultry's amazing vocals (backed by argubly the greatest drummer and bassist of all-tme). If your trying to get into this band, I would start with \\"Who's Next\\" as it showchases their biggest songs but from there you NEED \\"Tommy\\" and \\"Quadrophenia\\".    This is the album that made The Who memorable and legendary. Buy, listen, and appreciate.
B000ZHEI4W|4.0|The revised edition has a pleasant writing style that that made it easy for me to apply what's taught in the book. It also uses the word \\"prayer\\" for the technique we're encouraged to employ. I find this helpful because it assists me to avoid my biggest pitfall when I use mind techniques: I push too hard and try to force outcomes. I find the style of this book promotes humility while still enabling me to be positive towards a specific outcome or goal. What I'm calling \\"humility\\" is actually getting my conscious mind and ego out of the way by aligning my intention with the transcendent power of a loving God. There are specific examples of the types of \\"prayers\\" that have been used successfully. I find that when I apply these principles my mood is better, my health is better and my life is better.
B00005JPY0|5.0|Easily best movie of 2008, and the most riveting comic book adaptation ever. This was written as more of a detective or mob movie then a high flying special effects parade, and i loved that about it. I was expecting a continuation of the dark brooding version of the last film, but i wasn't expecting such an improvement on the genre. This is the Batman we love, faced with tough choices and personal turmoil he still must don the cape and do whats right.     The cast from Batman Begins is back. Christian Bale reprises his role as the MIllionaire playboy Bruce Wayne by day, and intimadating crusader by night. Joined with his loyal friends Lucious fox, played by Morgan freeman, and Alfred the butler, played my micheal Caine. Gary oldman gets a little more development, as lieutenant/commissioner Gordon, as a lawman who sees corruption all around him and can only trust in a vigilante to get things done.     Welcome additions are Aaron Eckhart, and Maggie Gylenhaal. Aaron plays District attorney Harvey Dent who becomes the villian two-face. His part might not have been as insane as The joker ( more about him later) or as slick as the batman, but its was very essential to the plot. It's quite an arch to see someone good go bad, and how it happens is both exciting and miserably saddening.     Maggie Gylenhaal takes over for Katie Holmes as The love interest for both Bruce Wayne and Harvey Dent. It's a messy triangle, that is key to understanding the minds of Bruce Wayne and Two-face. Honestly i think mrs. Cruise would have been a bit out of her league with these Oscar & golden globe nominated scene stealers.     But lets get to the character of the hour or more less the Villian of the decade. Heath ledger's psychopathic Joker. I knew Heath was a great actor and was just on the cusp of more stellar work ( see his oscar nominated turn in Brokeback Mountain as proof) but i had no idea what i'd see on screen. This Joker is the sickest character i've seen in a while. Heath, once again, dissapears and lets this creature run wild all over the film. This joker is not into entertain other people he's only in it to entertain himself. And what Makes the joker laugh... absolute disorder. He'll pin man against man just to see how far you're willing to go to survive. There's no acid shooting flowers, no chemical bath, and no laughing gas (however there is one heck of a magic trick ). The party is all in his head, and Gotham is worse for it. He licks his facial wounds as a reminder of the monster he's become. He enjoys knives because of the prolonged agony they inflict. He doesn't even fear his own death. What an incredible nut-job.    This joker has no sympathy, no reasoning, no purpose other than to watch the world burn ( as Alfred suggests). What a character to introduce and pit against the man of justice. For the first time i understood why the joker was his greatest arch nemesis. I thought it was more superficial...serious and shadowy vs. playful and showy, but its really order vs. chaos, The joker is a lone figure who intimdates and frightens people into doing harm to one another for no better reason then he feels it should be that way. The batman is a lone figure who intimidates and frightens people into doing whats right and making them pay for their crimes because he feels it should be that way. 2 sides of the same coin. Amazing.     The action sequences are pretty killer, especially a car chase scene that introduces the bat-pod, a killer little 2 wheeler, that batman unleashes on the joker. The acting is top notch, and the story is really consuming. the 2 hour 32 minute run time is a bit much, but it's hard to imagine cutting anything without hurting the film as whole.     the good news is that the movie exceded the hype. I was waiting a while and i was more then satisfied. The bad news is that i'm not sure how this feeling could ever be revisited. Heath Ledgers's passing becomes even more sad after having created another iconic figure. We'll never see THIS Joker again. I also have no idea how they could top The Dark knight, or any other comic book movie again. The bar has officially been raised.     Heath Ledgers oscar whispers, should be screams at this point. Dead or alive, he deserves the award for this performance. But i will possibly go further, I think This movie should be a serious contender during award season. The whole production should be regarded for it's work from the haunting score,screenplay, amazing direction, special effects and sound.     if there is a ballot this tops my list.    RIP Heath ledger
B000MRAAJM|5.0|Awesome movie!!!!!!  The picture and video is amazing!  I would definitely recommend this movie on Blue Ray!!!!!
0743297334|3.0|It's not a bad book. It is a tale of the \\"lost generation,\\" the bitter, aimless men who saw the world end in WWI, but survived it. Having seen the end as young men, they seemed to live the remainder of their lives mourning the lost adrenaline rush, and seeking a way to find it again, such as bullfighting, or at least witnessing bullfighting, and glorifying the life \\"lived all the way up.\\"    But Hemingway's vaunted writing style is almost ridiculous in its \\"manly\\" terseness, eschewing most adjectives and adverbs, and reading as if he had a court reporter in his head, transcribing whatever his eyes took in: \\"We passed through a town and stopped in front of the posada, and the driver took on several packages. Then we started on again, and outside the town the road commenced to mount. We were going through farming country with rocky hills that sloped down into the fields. The grain-fields went up the hillsides. Now as we went higher there was a wind blowing the grain.\\" (That's in Chapter 11. It goes on, but there is no real purpose to it, so I will spare you.)    Then there's my favorite passage, from Chapter 12: \\"The girl came in with the coffee and buttered toast. Or, rather, it was bread toasted and buttered.\\"  Yeah, Ernie, I wasn't feeling quite comfortable with that damned adjective either. \\"What does he mean by 'buttered toast?'\\" I asked myself. But then you told me, in your simple declarative style, just exactly what \\"buttered toast\\" meant. Thanks for clearing that up.    I'll give him a break, because it is a hell of a novel for a 26-year-old to write, but I wish he had gotten over the machismo thing in his writing before he died. Since he didn't, I'll still take Steinbeck as my favorite American author.    By the way, if the characters in this book truly drank as much as Hemingway said they did, fictional livers must be made of sterner stuff than real ones.

1596912863|4.0|Shannon Hale's [[ASIN:1596912863 Austenland: A Novel]] examines the twentieth century woman's obsession with Pride and Prejudice, Mr. Darcy, and Colin Firth as Mr. Darcy. Jane Hayes, a very typical first name for a Jane Austenesque novel, is a thirty-something career woman in New York, whose mother is concerned that she has given up on love because of an unhealthy obsession with Mr. Darcy. An impromptu meeting with Jane's Great Aunt Carolyn changes the course of this woman's life when she is bequeathed a non-refundable trip to Austenland in England, which traditionally caters to the fantasies of the wealthy, trophy wives of powerful businessmen.<br /><br />I saw this book on Eclectic Closet and added it to my list of Jane Austen spin-off reads. It also helps fulfill my Irresistable Review Challenge. I have only 2 more books to read to finish off this challenge.<br /><br />***Spoiler Alert***<br /><br />Jane is hesitant to take up the task of severing her ties with her Mr. Darcy fantasies in Austenland, but ultimately decides to go and reclaim her \\"real\\" self and her ability to have a relationship without worrying about how it would end before it even began.<br /><br />She is a bit of a crazy character who numbers her boyfriends even if she only spent as little as a few weeks with them. She arrives at Austenland to be lectured by Mrs. Wattlesbrook about her finances and how she is not their typical client and that if she breaks the rules, she will be kicked out. Jane is uncomfortable in Regency clothes and manners from the start. The false manners and pretense grate on her nerves, which is when she begins to seek out some normalcy in Austenland and turns to the gardener, Martin. How cliche in my opinion, but for this book it worked. I was still rooting for Mr. Nobley...aka Mr. Darcy.<br /><br />Through a series of bungling moments, Jane gets trapped up with Martin and untangled from him. She then falls into the trappings of Austenland and Mr. Nobley. By the time her vacation ends, Jane has grown and changed...become a stronger woman.<br /><br />***End Spoiler Alert***<br /><br />I like this book because it is entertaining. Jane Austen and Pride & Prejudice are my favorite part of classic literature. I like how Shannon Hale builds up Jane as a lost, romantic career woman who struggles to find her perfect man. I like how skeptical the character is throughout the Austenland experience and how she struggles with herself to stay focused on the act and immersing herself in the role she is expected to play. I also enjoyed how this character learned that she should not have given up her dreams and her artistic outlet of painting, despite her move to graphic design on a computer. Hale does a great job showing the reader how Jane evolves. The final scenes are spectacular and kept me enthralled until its conclusion.d...become a stronger woman.    ***End Spoiler Alert***    I like this book because it is entertaining.

B0017I1FO4|5.0|This CD is awesome. I've always been a fan of Shinedown and their music, and this album doesn't let me down. It is characteristic of the band, but incorporates some new material as well. I highly recommend it!
B00005QDW5|3.0|I've heard all of the songs on this compilation, and I own most of the albums that they are from.  To me, it seems that these songs lose a lot of their appeal and meaning when they are separated from the albums in which they were originally released.  In particular, The Wall and Dark Side of the Moon are best listened to from start to finish.  Part of the reason I love Pink Floyd so much is that they could create an entire album that was in itself a work of art.<br /><br />Pink Floyd worked on a scale that is beyond most artists, especially today's sound bite radio-friendly pop and rap artists.<br />(Some rappers have shown some serious talent and artistry, but almost none of the marketable, wealthy ones do.)  Pardon the digression...<br /><br />Anyway, this is a compilation of some excellent songs, and for the person interested in the individual songs it's a good buy.  However, I think that what made Pink Floyd music truly great was the way it was composed as an album.
B0017I1FO4|4.0|Just picked this CD up today and am on my third listen through. I must say that Shinedown has lost its harder edge from CD to CD but they seem to gain something else. The Sound of Madness has a lot of lyrical high points. There is also a great flow to the album. However, there is one song that sticks out to me as a weaker song. Track 2, \\"Sound of Madness\\" tries to force this little line after the chorus and it doesn't fit. It then repeats it over and over.   All in all, another quality Shinedown album. I would just like to see that one song fixed up and to see Brent's vocal stretched even more, cause he has a stellar voice. Long time fans - pick it up, New listeners - the new sound will probably appeal to you if it hasn't in the past.
B000MR9D5E|5.0|This DVD's set shows how wonderful our world is, by now, because of the global warming and the endangered species in different points of the world. A 'must have' for any person that cares about the environment.
B0017I1FP8|5.0|If you liked the score to Batman Begins, then you will be thoroughly pleased with this one. It further explores and expands on all the familiar cues, and adds interesting new material as well. No throwaway tracks and the massive 16 minute plus finale ties up the entire album in a very satisfying manner. I suspect this one will age well...Highly recommended and definitely see the movie that spawned this incredible music!
1567184855|5.0|I am an objective type.  My science degree encourages physical evidence, where logic, objectivity, and physical proof are highly valued.  I can only say, this book resonated with me.  I bought it because I had an experience that I could neither explain, nor get comfortable with.  So, just like any scientist, I gathered information.  This was one of the books I picked up.  More than any other, it resonated with me in ways I cannot explain.  So, I write this review, not because it is logical or scientific, but because I feel compelled to do so.  You should read this book.  It may bring back some far away memory, as it did within me.
0800141849|5.0|I was surprised how good this movie was. It started a bit slow, but once you got to know the characters you really cared. Barbra was amazing and it really is one of the best movies I've ever seen.
0061537934|5.0|I usually can't read books about dogs because of the way they always end (inevitably, I know the dog will die and I can't bear to put myself through reading about it.)  However, this book was amazing.  I was able to read it non-stop and, in doing so, gained an even greater understanding of and appreciation for my own dogs.  I borrowed this book from the library, but upon finishing it, rushed right out to the bookstore to purchase my own copy so that I could have it to read over and over again.  I have also been pushing friends and family to read this story because I want others to see how wonderful it is.  Dog lovers especially need to read this book....I would give it ten stars if I could!!
B0019FOC5E|3.0|I was never a rabid ABBA fan. Growing up in the 60s and 70s, I had more than my fill of ABBA and was therefore never compelled to run out and buy some. Over the years, whether I liked it or not, ABBA music would consistently appear in movies I enjoyed- The Last Dance, Dick, Priscilla Queen of the Desert, Muriel's Wedding, Summer of Sam, Gossip, Dirty Rotten Scoundrels,Mohnny English, Man of The House, I Now Pronounce You Chuck and Larry and more recently, Get Smart. I can't get away from ABBA, but my kids raved about the show which I had never seen (a sort of Buono Sera Mrs. Campbell remake with a twist) and so I basically went to see the movie just to not be out of the loop. To my great surprise, I enojoyed it tremendously and I found myself singing ALONG! I loved the arrangements in the movie's soundtrack better than the show or the originals- and the voices of all the women were quite good- (remember Meryl's Heartbreak Hotel in Postcards from the edge?)and of course, Christine Baranski is fabulous as usual-but the men! Oy! Veh! Pierce Brosnan should never,ever attempt anything resembling real music again. It isn't quite as painful as Ewan Mc Gregor's caterwauling in Moulin Rouge, but well, let's say that they should have dubbed someone else in there (perhaps johnathan rhys Meyer's since his voice has a similar timbre). I found the movie very entertaining and the CD DOES remind me of the movie-which I saw with a group of girlfriends (memorably great fun) but had I not seen the movie, this soundtrack wouldn't stand on its own. For those of sensitive musical ears and discriminating taste- buy the London cast recording of the show -which I ended up doing- and of course, I decided that I had to add ABBA -The Definitive Collection, to my extensive library. 38 years later, it's somewhat more pleasant. Those were the days, my friend....
0316067601|4.0|I have read several of the more popular combat genre books over the last few years, Thunder Run, Jarheads, Not a Good Day to Die, etc. and I think Lone Survivor is one of the best I have read. I would have given it 4.5 stars if I could have. If anything is lacking, it is the just the quality of the narrative. The story itself is engrossing, motivational and heartfelt. It makes you realize that anyone who has shown the fortitude to make it to the end of SEAL training deserves a great deal of respect.
B000RPTQ1C|5.0|I honestly had not heard of Coldplay until the recent TV add. Now I'm listening to their new album all the time, buy it!!
B000RPTQ1C|4.0|No complaints about the content, but my copy of a CD can not be  played on MacBook. The laptop keeps spitting it out, so I can not open   it in iTunes or transfer songs to iPod. This is frustrating because, after legally purchasing a CD, I can not listen to it as I would like.
B0019FOC5E|4.0|I must admit to being surprised at the quality of the voices as displayed by the all-star cast--well, for the most part.  The female voices were excellent.  It didn't appear to be a requirement that the male leads be able to sing (well).  Although they were OK.  I have a whole new appreciation for the song WINNER TAKES IT ALL after seeing Le Streep's intensely emotional rendition/performance.  The major disappointment is that the song WATERLOO was not included on the CD.  I saw the the musical on Broadway.  Personally, I think it works better on the stage; however, it really comes down to your opinion of ABBA's music.  I thought it was all great fun and have listened to the soundtrack a couple of times today.
1416524800|4.0|\\"Deception Point\\" is Brown's third novel, written between his two (so far) Robert Langdon books ([[ASIN:1416524797 Angels & Demons]] and [[ASIN:1400079179 The Da Vinci Code]]). Like all of his books, it's a quick read despite being over 500 pages.<br /><br />The heroine is Rachel Sexton, daughter of a senator/presidential candidate. She's recruited by the president to help examine a meteorite found by NASA, which seems to contain proof of extraterrestrial life. Brown successfully mixes political intrigue, action and science into a page turning thriller. Brown is a teacher and he has the rare ability to educate and share information with his readers without slowing down the pace of his novels. If you can suspend your disbelief for some of the more fantastic sequences, \\"Deception Point\\" is a good pageturner.
006135323X|5.0|I really enjoyed this read.  It offered some interesting insight into the way people make decisions, form opinions.  Each discussion came with indepth desciptions of the experiments used to base assertions.  The thought process behind the experiments were also discussed in detail.
B00127RAJY|5.0|I tried out this video based on the large amount of positive reviews, and it is one of my favorite work out tapes. I try to do this every morning before school/work, since it is only about 18 minutes plus workout and cooldown. It is a short workout, but very effective, and depending on how you feel that day can choose the level of workout that you want. I also like to pair this tape up with another around 30 minutes to get a full workout if I feel determined, but this would be more than enough on its own.
B00005V9HH|4.0|The final climactic moment in The Usual Suspects is the vehicle by which this movie is mostly either worshipped or despised bitterly. Depending on how you see it, we either feel cheated about such a bizarre, seemingly impossible ending, or amazed at the curve ball thrown at us, under our noses the entire time. We may even wonder if this ending is proper etiquette, or \\"fair game, for a suspense to employ. Some may have seen it coming, but to those who didn't, it makes for one great surprise.     As odd as it may sound, I don't think that you can judge this movie on acting alone. Sure, Kevin Spacey does an exceptional job as Verbal Kint, who is interrogated by Detective Kujan. And Gabriel Byrnne does a commendable performance as Keating, a corrupt cop supposedly trying to steer right, but who gets back into the mix. Some of the performances aren't fantastic, but this is one time where I don't think they have to be. The method of getting to the story's climax is what \\"makes\\" this suspense fantastic. With the use of going back in forth in time, from the present in the detective's office where Kint is telling his story, to the past, where we not only learn about the five thugs who decide to the take the big job for Keyser Soze, to learning about each one of the five. There are some plot events that you will naturally look back to as \\"aha\\" moments. You can credit the screen writers for coming up with this; a creative job of making this work, which usually doesn't work in movies, or ends up sloppy.     In many respects, the mystery surrounding Keyser Soze is what makes this puzzle a little more than the average mystery. As you watch the film, it is actually this character, real or fake, that derives much of the motivation for actions of the thieves, such as their decision to take the big job on the boat. Soze is one of the worst villains of the film, and yet, much of the film you are trying to figure out if the infamous killer is more man or more myth. The mystery surrounding this diabolical character's whereabouts, and his association with evil, seems to give the film's final moments even more significance and tenseness.     Smart writing carries this film, albeit with a superfluity of profanity spewed about. Its plot is its main strength, and this is the kind of film you can watch again and pick up on things you missed before. Watch this film remembering to take note of all that is seen, and remembering that sometimes things aren't always what they seem.
B000069KGM|4.0|This is a high energy debut by Chicago (1969) that features a nice blending of \\"big band\\" type arrangements, hard rock and the (then) nascent jazz rock style. Aspects of the music that I always enjoyed were the fine vocal harmonies, the sophisticated ensemble playing and the arrangements for the brass instruments and woodwinds - these guys were exceptionally talented and forward-thinking (progressive) musicians.<br /><br />All of the band members are first chair players and there was obviously some interest in at least nodding in the direction of some of the avant-garde composers of the time (Edgar Varese for example). There is also a clear indication that some of the band members were interested in the heavier, harder edged sound of groups like the Jimi Hendrix Experience, which lends this music a certain...\\"wildness\\". This is brought to its fullest expression on Terry Kath's track Free Form Guitar, which consists of nothing but feedback on a heavily distorted electric guitar. At nearly seven minutes in length, I have never completely warmed up to this track, but then again I have always been a real stick in the mud.<br /><br />On the other side of the equation however, are classic Chicago compositions that feature the sophisticated ensemble work that characterized the best moments of their output from 1969-1972. Does Anybody Really Know What Time It Is, Introduction, Beginnings, Poem 58 and the lengthy closing track Liberation are all fantastic original compositions although I also enjoyed their cover of I'm a Man, which features some great bass playing by Peter Cetera (a very underrated bassist in my opinion). Unfortunately, while Danny Seraphine is an excellent drummer, I could have done without the drum solo on I'm a Man - again, I am a real stick in the mud.<br /><br />This remastered version by Rhino is fantastic and really brought back some nice memories of my old (and long-gone) LP. Speaking of which, it is pretty cool that they were able to squeeze the entire \\"double album\\" onto one CD. The CD booklet is quite nice and the sound quality is very good.<br /><br />In spite of my griping about the solos here and there, this is a good debut by the band. I have always considered Chicago the finest of those rock bands that blended big band type arrangements with rock (Lighthouse; Blood, Sweat and Tears etc) and this debut certainly demonstrates exactly why. Highly recommended along with Chicago (a.k.a. Chicago II) (1970), Chicago III (1971), IV (live) (1971) and V (1972).ire \\"double album\\" onto one CD.

B00125WAWS|5.0|This is one of those movies that is truly educational, provides insight on people's lives from another time and is quite entertaining. Watching this movie, I could get a sense of what it must have been like in segregated America. Using a debate team as the central concept, is a wonderfully original idea. The scene with Forest Whitaker and his family  after he runs over a pig, is especially poignant. This movie reminded me of 'Mississippi Burning' (another excellent movie). I hope this film brings attention to the art of debating which I think schools should encourage more, as an exercise in presenting structured arguments and building logical thinking capabilities. Denzel did a great job with this movie and in giving rather unknown African American actors a chance at the big screen which today seems to be monopolized by a few.
B000Y179KO|1.0|If you're a fan of the Eagles 70's masterpieces, whatever you do, don't buy this album. Imagine the worst backwash from Don Henley's and Glen Frey's worst 80's tripe and you'll have a picture of what it this album is. If I sound angry, I am. These guys can do better. They were once innovators, and they've certainly had enough time to pool some creative ideas. What they've cranked out here is complete soft-rock drivel with no hint of what they once were as a band. If on the other hand you like soulless, synthesized, overproduced, impotent elevator music, plunk down your dough. Just don't expect to once tap your foot or have the desire to sing along. Take it easy indeed.
B000V86OKG|5.0|I'm not sure which season I enjoyed more- one or two.  I'm leaning towards two.  Mainly because this season we are all familiar with the characters and their backgrounds.  Even better, this season delves deeper into Dexter's background, as well as a few other characters.  You'll be on the edge of your seat!<br /><br />Season 2 brings on the drama, a fast-paced thrill ride that takes you watching late into the night just to watch another episode because you can't wait to see what is going to happen next.  The actors in this season only get better, as does the writing.  We are given some satisfying conclusions to previous stories or characters.  We are left wondering where season 3 is heading.  I can't wait!!<br /><br />Dexter is as entertaining as anything you can come up with.  This is TV at it's most original.  I recently subscribed to Showtime just to see this show in the fall!  Don't miss out!
B0019IB26I|5.0|The opportunity to see this concert film on the big screen was amazing.  The energy that JM and JM3 exuded seemed to envelop the entire theater.  You could sense the trance-like state the artists were in while the music poured from within.  JM has definately refined his craft and brought his talent to the next level.  The blues set was particulaly emotional--I felt as though I was being dragged through the depths of his heartache...I definately left the theater a changed fan.  This perfomance leaves no room for doubt about the caliber of talent this young perfomer has, and I hope that he remains true to himself...I would hate to see another young star burn out too quickly.
B000003CMB|1.0|I was very disappointed with this CD.  It is not the album I remember.  Some of the material has been left off to allow the double album set to fit onto one CD.  Too bad.
B000EGF0B4|5.0|A very poignant film. I couldn't remain dry eyed throughout the whole thing, and I'm not one to get very emotional.<br /><br />This movie reminds me of my own struggal to reach out to someone when it's hard to. I think it will move anyone who's ever felt the pain that so often comes with the joy of love. If that's you, you will thoroughly enjoy this movie.
B00011F5DK|5.0|My husband and I truly enjoy this game.  It is not as addicting as Tetris but similar in nature, competing with quick sharp spatial skills.  The only thing I think that would make this game better is adding a hourglass to it as you get some people who take WAY too long on their turn.  Otherwise I highly recommend

I told him the next time I saw him that I had a treat for him.  I finished this book in just a few days.  He finished it over a weekend.  And we both wait in eager anticipation for book 2.      This is one of those stories you fall into.  No longer aware of the real world around you.  And for me, there is no better type of story.
B0012QE4Q2|3.0|I have not seen the DVD but did go to the movie at the theater. I had read the book and knew that it was great fun if not even close to historically accurate. That is OK by me. The movie is short so has very little time to tell a very long story. I was expecting it to be longer and I think it would have been better if it was longer. Having said that, I thought it was a very beautiful movie and the costumes were wonderful. I thought that Natalie Portman is great as Anne.

0789318121|5.0|This book is awesome, big and heavy, but awesome.  I usually dont buy things like this, I love Chris Nolan's work/imagination, Batman and Batman Begins and the Dark Knight.  If you like these things, you will love this book.  The first 60 pages or so are drawings/concept art of all sorts of things ranging from the Batpod to Harvery/Two Face.  There is alot of cool Joker stuff as well...you wouldn't believe some of the original concepts.  Page 66 and beyond is the script, and if you have seen the Dark Knight you know how amazing the script is.  It says its the shooting script and so far it is pretty acurate to what I saw in the film.  The pages are high quality and glossy.  This book looks and feels like a collectors item considering the quality of it and how well this movie is doing at the box office.    5 out of 5 stars.

B00005JPY0|4.0|So is this a full blown movement now?  Super pessimistic and dark movies where the heroes and villains are equally corrupt, where things end badly, and the viewer is left feeling like they've just watched their dog get shot?  We can call it New American Pessimism.  In the grand tradition of last year's critical darlings There Will Be Blood and No Country for Old Men, we have The Dark Knight.      I won't summarize the plot, one because there is a ton of plot, and two because there are countless reviews where you can read it for yourself.  The Dark Knight is a well made and polished movie that has some weighty themes and some very good acting.  Yet somehow, for all of the superlatives lavished on it, it leaves me a bit cold.  On paper, this is the Batman I've always hoped for.  I prefer Frank Miller's or Allan Moore's take, and this movie is a bit of both.  We get the non-stop action and brooding psychology of Miller's Batman, and the next level psychosis of Moore's Joker.  So what's not to love?    There is a ton to love about The Dark Knight.  First off, Heath Ledger owns this movie.  His Joker is much different than any other screen portrayal and his distinctive look and characteristics make his the definitive version.  It's like he channeled Moore's Killing Joke Joker, M's Peter Lorre's shuffling and ticks, and A Clockwork Orange's Malcom McDowell's bemused contempt for humanity in to one monster of a villain.  His look is also fantastic.  The broken makeup, the stringy hair, and the Glasgow Smile give me the creeps.   Ledger's Joker is completely impenetrable.  He's completely amoral, seemingly has no past, and all he seems to care about is causing chaos.  In Alfred's words, \\"some people just want to watch the world burn.\\"  He's the perfect embodiment of the assertion that Batman and The Joker are two sides of the same coin.  Ledger expresses this in several disturbing speeches, about how they're both the same, how they're both excellent at what they do, and howthey're destined to meet again and again because neither will back down or compromise in the slightest.  I've always wanted this to be explored in film, and at least from the Joker's side of things, I'm more than pleased.      On the Batman side however, I'm slightly disappointed.  It's not that Christian Bale did a poor job, it's just they packed so much in to it that Batman's perspective on his relationship to the Joker seemed hurried and undeveloped.  He mused briefly about what he must become to stop the Joker, and thinks about quitting for about 10 minutes, and then he's off to do some death defying action sequences.  To me, it seems like another movie was planned where Batman's side was more the focus instead of the Joker's, but because of Ledger's untimely death they decided to give Batman some token philosophical musings.  Plus his voice was just painful.  Tone your growl down a bit for the next movie Christian.      And that's a big problem in this movie, it's very overstuffed.  It's very long, and a very long movie has no right to be that crammed full of stuff.  Some of the plot points seemed to go by in a blur, and I admit that I sort of glossed over some of them.  But to it's credit, it does a heck of a lot better cramming in everything and the kitchen sink better than Spiderman 3, which felt corny and undeveloped.  I think the movie would have been more enjoyable if it was scaled back a bit.      The supporting actors were mostly good.  Aaron Eckhart was a lot better than expected as Harvey Dent, Gary Oldmann, who's always good really, played James Gordon very well again, and Michael Caine did well with the little he had to work with.  Maggie Gyllenhall is getting a bunch of flack, and it seems mainly because of her looks, but she was miles better than Katie Holmes.   The action was generally well shot, but kind of chaotic.  Again, it suffered a bit from having a too much going on.  The opening sequence, with its direct references to Heat was amazing though.      What I'm trying to understand is the purpose of the grim world view in movies like The Dark Knight and No Country for Old Men. Is it some attempt to articulate some great anxiety about the world we live in? You could always counter that it's just a movie, and just a comic book movie at that, but surely Christopher Nolan was aiming for art here, not just popcorn entertainment.    So why such a bleak world view?  My guess is that villains like The Joker and Anton Chigurh are suppose to be symbols for indiscriminate violence and terrorism. They're more forces of nature than actual people. But the Joker isn't a terrorist with any specific political goals like a real world terrorist. He's more like mad scientist, arranging things just to see what happens, so the terror is the means and the end. But he's also portrayed as the criminal pushing back at the pressure Batman pushed on him, so in some ways Batman is responsible for The Joker. It's been said before than America is responsible for the threat of terrorism that it's under, so maybe this is commentary on America's \\"vigilantism\\" in the world.    Anyway, The Dark Knight is definitely a fine film that deserves to be seen, especially for Ledger's iconic portrayal of The Joker.

0743298039|5.0|This book is exactly what I hoped it to be upon picking it up. It strangely reminds me of a dark roasted coffee- rich and deep and flavoful. It's a brilliantly woven yarn with layers of complexity and so mysterious as it leads you to the next unexpected twist lurking just around the corner. Read it near a fireplace and lose yourself to the brilliantly eerie story.
0785125965|2.0|The comic book media (Marvel)hyped it, and hyped it. It was big, check, it was big,... that's it. As for story line, don't expect much. I was surprised at the huge sales this title made. Shows that Marvel is sort of WWE, more glitter than substance, judging by this title. (SPOILER ALERT folks!!) Not to mention, Civil War (take the ending itself) was a rip off. ANother 'slugfest' between super types, who quickly pick sides like teens, and squabble where they should more realistically be (after a long established trust) reaching a juncture of agreement, with a few displaced allegiances here and there between the less stellar characters. The only good twist in this story: 1) Hulk blindsiding Dr. Strange by breaking his hands, showing off a dangerous new level of intellect coupled with his ferocity, 2) The arena in which he makes the 'heroes' fight each other, trying to vent off some of that pent up frustration he feels toward them. As for the rest of the story, Sentry's angle was pushed indeed, a little too much perhaps. Rushed is more like it. Even the action is not quite 'just' and fair to the other characters. Seems they pushed Hulk a bit too far here. Black Bolt, another good character from Marvel, lost all his credibility in 1 swift moment. True, Hulk has strength. But where the hell did he get the power to clog his ears???? How did gamma radiation do all that? His powers to me were always bordering on the side of realism, sort of driven by science and consequently, primal rage. But here, Black Bolt, who shatters mountains with a whisper, lost in a jiffy. That is why they never showed this most aniticipated of brawls: it was off panel. Black Bolt could probably go on whispering, at the least to keep Hulk at bay, and the inhumans have a load of science at their disposal to escape, relocate (like they have done before), while Hulk and Black Bolt laid it down. But Greg Pak rushed it, as it was difficult to show the fight to obtain that result: Hulk knocking out BlackBolt. Next, for a 'Sorcerer Supreme', it seems Strange really really has limits. Seems his billing as 'supreme' is also another 'overrating'. It seems Hulk is above magic, with Strange coupling with an extra dimensional magical demon, and yet coming up short, whatever the scenario. Anyhow, if it is a straightforward (minimal twist) slugfest between good guys you wish to see, this is for you. If you are indeed somehow looking for indepth turns and twists that were found in earlier Hulk tales (Planet Hulk, if you ask me was a very good angle), this is going to dissappoint. Cheers.
0061122416|5.0|My father picked up this book when he was in Japan and told me I might be interested in reading it.  But, to tell you the truth, sometimes it seems like my dad can be far off, but other times he can be spot on.  This time, he was right.  I couldn't put the book down as soon as I started reading it.  I realized that I was much like Santiago and am on the journey to fulfill my personal legend.  People tell me that wanting to follow my dream is crazy, but this has really opened my eyes and has made me pursue my dream even more.  I would recommend this book to anyone that is interested in listening to their hearts and following their dreams.  It has changed my life, and I hope that it reaches many more.

6302662648|3.0|The film begins on a snowy night. Hackers broke into a computer to issue checks to various groups. One leaves to buy food, the others are caught by the police. [Was such hacking possible in 1969?] Later we see a group who are tapping into phone lines. An alarm goes off because of a device in a safety deposit box. This is all part of a burglary that tests security for a bank: its perfectly legal. Two businessmen arrive at Martin Bishop's company to hire him for a special job. They'll do it for the money. They start to surveil the subject, a professor who may have a formula to create unbreakable codes. Others are interested in that professor's work. \\"Social engineering\\" is used to gain admittance to the target corporation. [The slow response to questions tells of the prompting.] Does Bishop talk too much at that party? \\"Too many secrets?\\"    Can one device the size of a cassette telephone answering machine allow unauthorized access to secured sites? [Only in a Hollywood film.] Does possession of this device put them in grave danger? \\"Who were those guys?\\" Now the mystery begins. Should Martin disappear again? Could a private business have great need for that device? Can official records be changed to create evidence? Who can you trust? The team plans to break into the corporation to retrieve that device. Is it an impossible mission? The film makes it seem plausible. Will there be any problems to hype the drama? Will the good guys win against the odds? The usual formula says they will, with plenty of action at the finish. Does the deus ex machina ending detract from the story?    Does the idea of organized crime owning an electronics company seem far out? Do legitimate companies build trapdoors into their software to allow clandestine access to their customer's data? What do you think?

0393324818|4.0|This is an excellent introduction to the conception and process of applying sabermetrics, the objective cold-hard-facts method of valuing baseball players in terms of their probabilities of generating runs on offense and preventing runs on defense, to the cost efficient management of a baseball team.     This introduction is accomplished through an almost allegorical tale about Billy Beane, first as a baseball player and then as the General Manager of the Oakland Athletics.  As such, it tends to read a bit like a tribute or hero-worship novel as Billy Beane is touted for his trailblazing approach to using statistical analysis, not baseball \\"wisdom\\", to value players and assemble winning teams within a fixed budget.  But there is purpose in the telling of \\"The Billy Beane Story\\" and it is to use it as a literary device to keep the reader engaged as a rather dry subject (statistical analysis and dispassionate player evaluation) is revealed.    If you think that Derek Jeter is a great fielding shortstop, you will learn about tools that demonstrate rather convincingly that, despite Jeter's Gold Glove awards, he is a rather pathetic fielder for a major league baseball player.  You will learn about tools that allow a baseball general manager to recognize the value of rather unimpressive physical specimens (e.g., catcher turned first baseman Scott Hatteberg) as surprising productive players when they are important contributors to team success.      Sabermetrics is not widely respected among most who run the show on major league teams today.  But there is a slow yet growing recognition of its value.  Billy Beane and the Oakland A's may have bmost recently the first, but such methods are being adopted by more and more teams, including the and the Toronto Blue Jays and the Boston Red Sox.  (Is it merely a coincidence that the Red Sox finally won the World Series after an 86 year drought only once its ownership and general management adopted a sabermetric approach to player evaluation?)  This book will effectively and entertainingly expose you to subtle yet powerful new approach to team management that is growing within baseball.  If you love baseball ... if you think you know how to evaluate baseball players ... this is a very worthwhile read.

B00005JPY0|4.0|So Batman is back? and this time \\"The Dark Knight\\", has more shadow, more danger, is more menacing etc etc?<br />One can be forgiven for asking these things amidst the morass of versions of the popular comic book hero over the years, but particularly since Tim Burton's visionary remake back in 1989 with Michael Keaton, and Jack Nicholson as the Joker.<br />Now unless you've been living in a cave somewhere, you will no doubt have caught some of the hype surrounding the movie, particularly Heath Ledger's performance as the psychotic perennial smile wearing criminal, so bittersweet after his untimely death.<br />Chris Nolan makes a valiant effort here in his follow up to Batman Begins staying with the same characters, building on them, and continuing the \\"darker\\" side of Bruce Wayne's crime fighting alter ego. With the exception of a few, the same actors also reprise their roles from the last picture, with the main exception of Maggie Gyllenhaal as Rachel Dawes, who is easily as beguiling as Katie Holmes last time in the same role.<br />The movie is fast paced, with some necessary pauses for dramatic buildup but moves fairly steadily over the almost 2½ hour run time, the gadgets get a little better but still remain vaguely believable as do Batman's abilities, in fact this time we actually see a few chinks in the armor.<br />The support cast are excellent, particularly Gary Oldman, Michael Caine and Morgan Freeman, and Bale is suitably beefed but suave and almost arrogant as our hero. Aaron Eckhart as Harvey Dent / Two Face is a nice distraction, but his place in the movie could arguably been trimmed or even sidelined for the next movie, and ultimately makes this picture unnecessarily overfilled with diverging storylines.<br />But make no mistake, the movie belongs to Ledger, and at times it seems that every one else is simply along for the ride. Within the storyline you find yourself suspending disbelief quite readily as The Joker goes on his one man demolition job, without conscience or care, bringing a real edge to his characters deviant sociopathy.<br />It's difficult not to compare Nicholson and Ledgers performances side by side, but on close scrutiny where the former had some of the quirky likeability and almost lovable psychosis (reminiscent even of Cesar Romero in the camp TV show), Ledger is firmly grounded and oozes malevolence, when you laugh, it's usually nervous laughter as the character is dangerously unpredictable.<br />On the positive side the movie has plenty of action, good CGI and bone crunching fight scenes and gadgets, which should please the most ardent fan of the movie genre. It also has enough depth to keep the more discerning viewers interest.<br />On the negative, too long, and I mean TOO long, nothing would have been lost had this movie been shaved by at least 25 minutes, and even moved to the next movie (for which I hear Bale is contracted to make). Testament to this is the fact that as the viewer you expect to have seen the end credits roll, on at least 4 occasions before they actually do. Also as mentioned earlier Nolan has tried to cram too many plotlines and individual character embellishments together and it gets a bit messy.<br />Those minor complaints aside, this IS a good movie, and worth seeing for Ledgers performance alone, a powerhouse performance of character acting that will I'm sure be a strong, but strange epitaph to a tragic loss of talent.e, bringing a real edge to his characters deviant sociopathy.

B00005JPY0|5.0|The Dark Knight is proof positive that a great movie can be made based off of comic book source material. Other movies (Iron Man, X-Men, Spiderman, etc.) have come close to depicting utterly ridiculous (in the context of the real world) characters as characters that actually become believable due to the settings and character development. It's no small feat making a character that dresses up like a bat believable or the world he inhabits, but Christopher Nolan (and his brother) succeed. Their first Batman movie (Batman Begins) was the shot in the arm for re-imaging a movie franchise. The Dark Knight continues in that tradition and ups the ante ten-fold.     All of the praise and accolades it has been receiving are all on point and not overblown. I went into it with high expectations and left feeling like all were met. Not many movies have had that success (i.e. Indiana Jones and the Kingdom of the Crystal Skull, for one). The movie starts with a bang (literally) and never lets up with the action set pieces, the top-notch acting and story, and great musical score (by the always great Hans Zimmer and James Newton Howard).     In short, the movie opens with a bank robbery that leads to the reveal of the Joker and his interest in filling the void of leadership of the criminal element of Gotham. Heath Ledger is completely absorbed into the makeup and character to where you have to shake your head to realize it really is Ledger. (His voice and mannerisms are all Joker.) He did an absolute job and I will be shocked if he isn't nominated for Best Supporting Actor. Jack Nicholson defined the Joker in the late `80's. Ledger has defined the Joker for the present and future. THIS is the Joker from the comics. He is a self-indulgent, unethical, immoral maniac who has no real goal other than, to quote the movie, \\"Watch the world burn.\\" This type of villain forces Bruce Wayne/Batman into having to re-evaluate his own code as the Joker will do anything to wreak utter havoc on Gotham. Will Batman be able to do everything possible (and then some) to counter the Joker? This was brought up in Batman Begins with the villain Ras Al Ghul  telling Bruce Wayne literally that. It was a question of how far was the hero willing to go.     The movie is rather long (2hrs and 20+ minutes) and at times quite violent. This is clearly not a kids' movie and I have to say I am bothered by how many parents I saw bring little kids (a lot younger than 13) into the movie. There are some scenes of violence and cruelty that, frankly, are going to scare the heck out of the kids and the parents bringing real young children to this should be ashamed. Find a babysitter or don't complain about a psychiatrist's bill later in life!          SPOILERS START:                  Perhaps the best kept secret for the audience (unless you are a super-fan who read all the websites) was the origin of Two-Face. The end result was gruesome and a little over-the-top. For a minute, I forgot who the director was, as I had to swear it was Sam Raimi. That was one of two gripes I had with the movie. The other being, Rachel Dawes character is so one-dimensional, that I hardly cared when she met her fate. The subsequent events also caused me to feel a bit conflicted as to the resolution an ultimate ending of the movie.               END OF SPOILERS:              If you see one movie this summer (not to sound like a movie tagline), see The Dark Knight. It is a crime drama, not unlike a combination of The Godfather and Heat, with the Caped Crusader up against some overwhelming odds. The story, acting, music, and special effects are all top-notch (Chicago makes a great setting for Gotham). This is the Dark Knight as he was intended to be and I can only hope that there is a third one, as good as this one and Batman Begins.

B00004U8JV|5.0|The first JP movie was very flamboyant, colourful and fresh. This movie feel a bit gloomy, realistic and simple. I really liked this film for it's realism, it does not have the great story the book gave us, but it's still up there with the first film. I did expect a bit more variety of dinosaurs in this film though, the only real new players are the Stegosaurusses, Compys and one brief shot of Pteranadons. I did want the movie to be even a bit more darker and would have liked more scenes at the compound and less Trex scenes. If you look at the bonus material in this dvd you get to see some great concept art that never made it to the movie. The trailer scene is one of the greatest scenes of the JP series though. The music was a bit of a let down, the drums are beautiful in some places, but overall it misses the strength of the first soundtrack. Also I'd really like to see the 2 deleted scenes added back into the movie, especially the Pete Postletwaite scene which builds a lot of character.
0786182466|3.0|After hearing about this book for almost half my life, I was excited to find the audio book version at my local library.  This is my review of the audio book version.      The voice actor does a good job of differentiating the characters, making it fairly easy to follow the story and understand who's talking.  The book is populated with a myriad of colorful characters, most of whom are reduced to fairly exagerrated caricatures by the author.  While entertaining in the early going, some of them begin to grate on you after a while.      The dialogue is as colorful as the characters, with a lot of vernacular that is specific to a certain era in New Orleans.  While this grabs your interest and pulls you into the story, I found that the cartoonishness of the characters and their over-the-top dialogue started to lose its appeal by the halfway point.  Towards the end, I had grown weary of the entire cast and couldn't wait for the long-awaited (and woefully unsatisfying) end to come.      The main character, Ignatius J. Reilly, is a self-centered buffoon who clearly has some emotional and/or mental problems.  I imagine that Reilly is the alter-ego of the author (John Kennedy Toole), who had his own emotional/mental problems (and ultimately committed suicide before this book was ever published).  There are many parallels between the author and his creation, so the conclusion is easy to draw.     While Toole does have a certain way with words and his vivid descriptions are often admirable, he clearly lacks any sense of how to effectively plot a story.  Instead, he rambles along in an almost stream-of-consciousness fashion, blissfully unaware that flowery dialogue and off-beat characters do not a story make.     What I find most distressing is that this book won a Pulitzer Prize for fiction.  Had the book not gotten published through such a dramatic series of circumstances I highly doubt it would have won any literary prize, let alone a Pulitzer.  The competition must have been very weak that year indeed.    It's particularly telling that when the author originally attempted to get this book published, the publisher ultimately turned it down because \\"it's not really about anything.\\"  And frankly, they were right.      While I did find the book humorous in several places, even laugh-out-loud funny at times, I must admit that overall I was fairly disappointed.  The book simply did not live up to my expectations (and no, my expectations were not unusually high).  However, I do tend to enjoy stories with a plot that actually go somewhere and have a point that makes it worth my while.  This book is like cotton candy: you may think it's tasty and sweet while you're eating it, but ultimately it never fills you up no matter how much of it you indulge in.  In the end, it just leaves you even hungrier than you were when you started.  Substantial it is not.     If you enjoy extremely offbeat stories full of surreal characters spouting pompous dialogue as they stumble their way aimlessly through farcical circumstances, then this book is right up your alley.  Just don't look for a plot, because you won't find one here.
B00005JPY0|5.0|With all the hype, the tragic death of one of the lead actors and the burden of being a sequel, one might think that \\"The Dark Knight\\" couldn't possibly live up to its expectations.  With critical acclaim and almost 159 million at the domestic box office, this movie has proclaimed itself the box office champ of the summer, smashing records left and right in only a couple of days.<br /><br />  Improving upon the components that made \\"Batman Begins\\", its predecessor, this film surpasses the first and raises the bar for all other comic book movies from this point on.  This Batman is dark, a hero but not the perfect savior that we tend to see in Superman or Spiderman.  Christian Bale does a great job as playboy billionaire Bruce Wayne, a charming lady killer by day and a brooding vigilante by night.  Surrounding Bale is the ever-talented duo, Michael Caine and Morgan Freeman as Alfred the Butler and Lucius Fox, respectively.  Caine is charming as Wayne's loyal friend and right hand man, who often guides the young man through many of the difficult choices he must make.  And Fox, also a moral center for Wayne, runs Wayne Enterprises and helps aquire all those fancy gadgets and amazing vehicles and suits that aid the Batman in his fight against crime.<br /><br />  Aaron Eckhart plays the suave, handsome Harvey Dent (and eventual villain Two Face), a charasmatic D. A. who is dating Wayne's former flame Rachel (now played by Maggie Gyllenhaal).  And there is also Gary Oldman, playing Lt. Gordon---all three doing a great job in their prospective roles.  It is, however, the late Heath Ledger that shines as the Joker, a sadistic sociopath who decides to use Gotham as a lab for his experiment in cruelty and fear.  Ledger's Joker ups the anty, besting Jack Nicholson's version of the villain and guaranteeing himself a posthumous Oscar nomination for a truly inspiring performance.  This villain is pure evil at heart; not tempted by money but instead entertained at the pain he causes in all around him.  Ledger creates a character that would equally fit in a good horror movie, the kind of demented evil that sends a chill down your spine.  The greatest sadness is that Heath Ledger never lived to see his amazing performace appreciated by both fans and critics alike.<br /><br />  At almost 2.5 hours running time, \\"The Dark Knight\\" is well worth every minute spent.  The special effects are incredible, as expected, and the story, characters and performances are beyond reproach.  Nolan is an amazing director (as he has proven before with films such as \\"Memento\\" and \\"The Prestige\\") and deserves his share of the credit.  This film is lucky to have that perfect combination of ingredients needed to make a really great film---director, actors and story, all well done and appealing to a mass audience.  Highly recommended to all...Batman fans or not.  This is the kind of movie meant to be seen on the big screen!all around him.

B0016Q56C4|5.0|They don't waste a lot of time getting you on the rides; a little set-up, some character drama-  research in jeopardy, nephew with teenage issues, beautiful guide with attitude; your goals: save the Institute, find lost brother/nephew's father, find center of the Earth. How do you do it?   Fall in hole- Ahhhhhh....! The other rides: Runaway Railcar, Wild Waterslide, Mushroom Forest, 'Tom Sawyer's' Rafting Adventure, Perilous Parasailing, DinosaurLand, Volcanic Eruption, Ride the Raging Geyser, Eat Grapes.  And do it in 3-D!    As a child, I loved the old movie with James Mason and Pat Boone.  Boy, you could do a lot with little in those days, but like that one, this movie is simply for adventure and fun, but now loaded with CGI's and spectacular vistas. Could the kids of today stand for the old version?     The actors: Branden Fraser is his usual affable, comedic, heroic self; although, he has starred in some dark movies, \\"Gods and Monsters\\" and the \\"R+\\" rated, \\"Journey to the End of the Night.\\"(Stick with this journey.  He does this role so well.  Hey, when's Mummy III coming out?); Josh Hutcherson as his quickly, maturing nephew(Sean) and Anita Brien(Hannah) as the skeptical, 'you owe me', but warming, Icelandic guide are fine, too.  And there's a little bit of romance. Much like a Verne story,  I always wanted more.  But we're here for adventure not the Tunnel of Love.  Finally, it surprised me that there was no villain.  -The antagonist is nature, come on!-  Hmm, is that a plus or a minus?    I give it 5 stars for the 3-D version, 4 otherwise, for the genre it is.  The time flew by; I could watch it again, and the kids loved it.  No language, no sex, no true violence, watchable actors, and bucks on the visuals.  I'm off to Iceland.  No, make that Italy land.  Ciao!
B001B71NOI|2.0|The problem with The Slip is that there's almost nothing new about it. Even that aspect of it isn't new. NIN already have one \\"let's just rock out and have a good time\\" album, 2005's With Teeth. That album is also more fun to listen to than this one.    It's somewhat disappointing when you consider Trent Reznor's other recent work. Year Zero (2007) was a startling, original reinvention. At least, I personally would never have expected the voice of nineties teenage angst to become a visionary prophet of the apocalypse. Ghosts I-IV (2008) was uneven, but it was also an original move, possibly the only thing Reznor could have done at that point without repeating himself. And although it may have been too long, many of the tracks on it truly expanded Reznor's horizons as a composer.    But even the best songs on The Slip would have sounded more or less average on With Teeth. \\"Discipline\\" is a very catchy single, but it's practically a rewrite of \\"The Hand That Feeds,\\" except the production leans more toward the electronic sound of Year Zero. And the drum track sounds like it comes from Blur's \\"Song 2.\\" I'm sure it will sound great live, but it really shouldn't be an album's greatest draw.    The loud angry songs all sound very similar, and much more rudimentary than even the songs on With Teeth (which were already stripped-down). Songs like \\"1,000,000,\\" \\"Letting You\\" and \\"Head Down\\" use almost identical two- and four-note guitar riffs. Of course, NIN albums were always more about Reznor's vocals than the music, but these songs don't have any particularly interesting vocal rhythms either.    And the lyrics, man, they're really phoned in. It almost seems like they're just mash-ups of typical NIN phrases: \\"when you crawl on your hands and your knees,\\" \\"I feel a million miles away, I don't feel anything at all,\\" \\"Believing your charade, begin to suffocate,\\" \\"This is all a dream and none of you are real,\\" \\"I'll give anything,\\" \\"It keeps growing and I can feel it breathe,\\" \\"Now I know what this is all about,\\" \\"I will use my fist to destroy everything I can,\\" etc. Even Year Zero suffered from this problem a little, but there Trent made a concerted (and successful) effort to tell a story about the world around him. Here, he's back to railing against \\"them\\" and describing his emotions.    The second half of the album changes gears completely and sounds more like Ghosts. But there, too, most of the music isn't as good as the best Ghosts tracks. \\"Lights In The Sky\\" is Reznor's least interesting piano ballad (if you want to hear one of his more interesting ones, try I-1 on Ghosts), and \\"Corona Radiata\\" is the kind of droning ambient loop that appears in a few Ghosts tracks, except here it's stretched out to seven and a half minutes to become the longest song on any NIN full-length. Yet it really doesn't have any more musical content than \\"999,999,\\" the minute-long \\"Pinion\\"-like opener.    The one interesting exception is the instrumental \\"The Four Of Us Are Dying.\\" In addition to an evocative title, it also has an excellent, deep bass line. Trent has never been the best guitarist, but he's become very good at writing bass lines -- all the good songs on With Teeth had bass and not guitar leads, Year Zero had a few of them too (especially \\"The Warning\\"), and so did a few of the best Ghosts tracks. Perhaps he's been secretly taking lessons from Peter Hook. Anyway, this bass line rumbles ominously with a softer keyboard rhythm laid over it, creating a cool dark-ambient vibe. Hopefully this is the kind of thing he'll be exploring on his next album.    Also, the one vocal track that grew on me with time was \\"Echoplex.\\" It would have fit in well with the less aggressive bass-driven songs on With Teeth. The music largely consists of a bouncy drum rhythm and more of that deep bass, with little else of note. But despite the upbeat rhythm, the song itself sounds kind of murky and ambiguous. It never builds up to any kind of climax, instead there's a break in which Trent whispers in time with the beat. The odd tension makes it stand out.    I don't want to sound too critical...he did release the entire album for free, and it's still up for download on NIN's website. And critics liked it for once, so I might be in the minority. But I still feel that it falls below the standard Trent has set in the past two years. Perhaps one should view it as an EP and not a full-length album.
0446402389|3.0|I bought Child 44 because I am a big Martin Cruz Smith fan.  Others like me--BE WARNED.  We love Arkady Renko for his oh-so-Russian, no-good-deed-goes-unpunished black humor and his exhausted kindness.  Neither of these qualities exists in this novel.  The intellectual moebius strip of acceptable Stalinist thought, the utter devastation of emotional life and the reduction of every interaction to zero sum survivalism is the background, foreground and plot of Child 44.  In that sense, this book is a direct descendant of Orwell's 1984.  It is the bleakest book I have read since that classic novel--to the extent that I felt damaged by the time I got to the end.    In a sense, I am writing two reviews for Child 44.  Smith succeeds to a truly astonishing degree in evoking a world that, as an American, I literally can hardly imagine and found almost unbearable.  In this fictional account he has created a picture of the Stalinist USSR more vivid than any non-fictional account could ever be--even The Gulag Archipelago was never such a bludgeoning.  This is reality in which the banality of evil has triumphed completely, in which the brutality of the State trumps the horror of a child-killer in every way.  If you find utter oppression difficult to read about, beware.  It has seldom been depicted better.    Having said that, however, I must agree with previous reviewers who have found fault with the book as a murder mystery.  The author spends so much energy creating Soviet Russia that the police procedural is kind of a literary hitchhiker--getting picked up and dropped off erratically until the last few chapters.  I also felt that the carefully constructed non-relationship between Leo and his wife, Raisa, was treated very badly in order to get to the end of the book.  Child 44 would be a much more cohesive book if it had just been an examination of the State and the marriage, without the sensational murders and the implausible (in several ways) ending.    If I could, I would give Child 44 5 stars for the recreation of the nightmare world of the USSR and 2 stars as a murder mystery.
0307386171|5.0|Romantic, thought-provoking, melancholic, heartbreaking...These are the words I would use to describe this novella...At first, it took me awhile to really \\"get into\\" this book (in fact, I would probably give it about four and a half stars, but I round up...), but once I appreciated McEwan's beautiful writing and strong characters, I fell so vividly in the book...I do have to say that at first I wanted more of a plot until I appreciated that McEwan takes a small moment and just goes with it...You'll think about this book after you put it down.  (By the way, I felt that the book was not unrealistic.  Florence's response/feelings may be very uncommon but not impossible.)
0930289234|5.0|How can i describe Watchmen? Suppose that one was to rate movies and books for what you would pay for the chance to enjoy them, not for their overall influence on society, but for your own enjoyment only. Value goes up, like all other goods, with low supply. So a movie like the Dark Knight, I would easily pay $60 or $70 to see. (glad i didn't have to.) Watchmen would fall in the several hundred dollar range. Every single chapter (episode, issue, whatever they're called) is completely engrossing.<br /> As someone who enjoys the comic genre I feel that it is ok for characters to be repetitive in their abilites. When many reviewers referred to the individual powers in The Incredibles (pixar) as remarkably creative I scoffed, all were rehashes. But I also didn't hold that against the movie. So many types of heroes are reused that I don't expect them to be original. So I was all the more amazed when I found in Watchmen characters that were original. Rorsharch, Dr. Manhattan, Ozymandas, The Comedian, (ok maybe the Night Owl is a Batman ripoff) are all completely... completely unique... and here's the kicker, there's a reason they haven't been copied. Because Moore created them for this exact story. They are unique products of their world and any writer who tried to use them in another story would be unable to transpose them correctly.<br /> The thing is, the entirety of the novel is like this. other unique story telling aspects, such as the comic within the novel, and the historical interludes, are delivered in a way as if the story telling required it, so Moore had no choice but to create it.<br /> It is completely rereadable. In fact, it is compulsively rereadable. Don't leave it on a readily available shelf because it will end up back in your hands.<br /> I've decided, I would pay $500 for Watchmen. Glad I don't have to.
B000WCDI64|5.0|I fell in love with Amy at the Mandela concert in June 2008. Had only heard she won several Emmys, never seen her, was unaware of a single title. But she blew me away with her sheer presence. I was pretty close to the stage, but I rate her presence up with some all stars - Santana, Jethro Tull, Bowie, Hendrix and JFK - does that really date me!    She is a great singer. Period. The range of music in her live concert is simply fabulous. The band behind her is equally fabulous and that is her musician recommendation. My recommendation is that I have watched her concert every night for the last 4 nights and I have only owned the DVD that long. I haven't seen the DVD to the end. Oh my and she likes Thelonious Monk - so do I.    But I am caught up in the fears surrounding her well being - if there were anything I could do to help her I surely would - she is such a plus to our world. Would love to meet her - she exudes.

I've taught slavery, Pre-european contact, and Egypt yet I've never studied or taught about imperialism in Africa. In preparation for teaching this period in a Modern World history class I've been reading about Africa. Wow - this book blew my mind.

B000YAA68W|4.0|Hand-drawn animation, especially simple black-and-white drawings, is so rare to see on the big screen that one has to appreciate the emotional nakedness that Marjane Satrapi and her fellow cartoonist Vincent Paronnaud bring to this 2007 fictionalized memoir of Satrapi's formative years as the free-spirited daughter in a liberal Iranian family. The 95-minute film follows the same abstract style found in her best-selling [[ASIN:0375423966 autobiographical graphic novel]], adding color for the present-day scenes and using a shadow theater approach to the historical sequences. The cumulative effect works well within the context of the story's volatile emotional changes as it alternates in quicksilver fashion between poignant, funny and harrowing. The film reminds me a bit of Mark Forster's adaptation of Khaled Hosseini's [[ASIN:B0012OX7EO The Kite Runner]], which also has a protagonist forced to live in exile due to the advent of war and tyranny. The difference is that Satrapi's family stayed in Tehran throughout the turmoil brought on by the Shah's overthrow, the oppressive fundamentalist regime that followed, and the Iran-Iraq war. Some of this comes across as a bit muddled, but the propulsive narrative drive and empathetic voice characterizations compensate greatly.<br /><br />The plot flashes back to Marjane's childhood in Iran during the 1970's as she gradually begins to understand how her family has been mistreated and imprisoned due to their Communist leanings under the Shah. Once the Islamic Revolution deposes of the Shah in 1979, the family faces even more persecution by the new government. Forced to wear a burqa, Marjane has an escalating desire to express her individuality through listening to heavy rock music and questioning authority at every turn. During the 1980's, Marjane's parents decide to send their daughter to Austria to continue her education since Iran was becoming a political hotbed with the oncoming Iran-Iraq war promising even greater horrors. In he meantime, Marjane never fits into Viennese student life, and her situation worsens with a series of bad romantic relationships. She ends up on the streets, and her desperation becomes such that she returns home to Iran. Falling into a crevasse between Western and Eastern cultures, Marjane falls into a depression until she faces up to her true fate. What Satrapi and Paronnaud do especially well is make the animated Marjane's journey a universal one that gives personalized insights into the current challenges facing the Middle East.<br /><br />The 2008 DVD offers both the original French and English-dubbed versions of the feature. The filmmakers recruited quite a cast of voices to inhabit the characters, including Chiara Mastroianni as Marjane, her mother Catherine Deneuve as Marjane's mother, and another legend, Danielle Darrieux as Marjane's feisty grandmother. Deneuve and Darrieux played mother-and-daughter in Jacques Demy's candy-coated musical, [[ASIN:B000062XI7 The Young Girls of Rochefort]] over four decades earlier. On the English version, Mastroianni and Deneuve repeat their roles, but Gena Rowlands takes over for Darrieux. There are several other extras on the DVD, the chief one being a half-hour documentary in French, \\"The Hidden Side of Persepolis\\", which gives a highly detailed look at the production process. Satrapi and Paronnaud are interviewed extensively, as are several crew members and both the 91-year-old Darrieux and Mastroianni (a dead ringer for her father Marcello). There are two other pieces - a brief short, \\"Behind-the-Scenes of Persepolis\\", which focuses primarily on the English dubbing process with Rowlands and Iggy Pop, and a half-hour press conference held at the 2007 Cannes Film Festival with Satrapi, Paronnaud, the film's producers, as well as Mastroianni and Deneuve. There is no full-length directors' commentary track, but three scenes have individual subtitled commentary - Satrapi on the opening scene in color, Mastroianni on theamusing \\"Eye of the Tiger\\" scene, and Paronnaud on the establishing shots of Vienna. Particularly interesting are five other scenes where we are shown the storyboards versus the final animation.the Tiger\\" scene, and Paronnaud on the establishing shots of Vienna.

0312379293|4.0|I thoroughly enjoyed this book.  I found it compelling and I did not want to put it down.  I think the author did a great job weaving an intricate story.  I love to have someone to root for and I got that in Danny Cartwright.  I found myself thinking about this book many times as if the events were actually occurring in real life.  I liked the fast pace of the book too.<br /><br />There were definitely a few things that didn't seem realistic to me but I was willing to suspend reality a bit for a good story.  Probably the biggest  problem for me was to have a completely illiterate man become not only proficient in his academic abilities over a very short time but excel beyond all others in his college courses or leap from not being able to read at all to reading Bleak House and the like.<br /><br />Absolutely worth your time to read this book!
0385340567|1.0|The book has two major faults. The first is that fiction writters should always avoid political hot button issues - they will anger an average half of their reading public. The author using his ex-army super hero as the messenger, roils against the war in Iraq, and promotes troops going AWOL and hiding in Canada. This stirs very unpleasant memories as well as  slighting our current all-volunter force.  The second fault of this author is his venier-thin knowledge of the Army. He should either hire an expert advisor or stay away from \\"explaining\\" military culture and operations.  As rarely happens, I chose not to finish the book.    Walt Mehl
B00133KFGW|5.0|This has to be one of the best movies I've seen that ties the connection that music makes to human emotion. Not only is the music inspired, but the performers are especially convincing. Jonathon Rhys Meyers has an amazing voice, Keri Russell, while not really 'playing' the cello has obviously studied well for this role, as her handing of the instrument and the body language she projects are passionate and convincing. Then there's Freddie Highmore, clearly the star of the movie. How does a kid of his age access such depth within himself to play a child prodigy with so much conviction and enthusiasm? Beats me, but he was a joy to watch in every scene.    The added bonus here, and for me the thing that catapults this movie to greatness, is the spiritual connections made throughout. They are made in several subtle ways, but those who are especially attuned to that sort of thing will find plenty of inspiration.
0375424474|5.0|I was required to read this book for a class I was taking but oddly enough I found it to be thoroughly enjoyable.  Shubin guides the reader through his career and his discoveries and how they came to shape his knowledge and impressions of evolution.      The way that Shubin presents his knowledge to the reader is very organic. He flows from one point to another as he builds upon his evidence and shoes you the conclusions that can be made from it.  The best part of the book is the fact that while Shubin is presenting some heavily scientific ideas he does it in a way that is easily accessible to the lay person.      Overall I found this book to be very effective and I would recommend to any person who wishes to educate themselves about evolution.
B000V656HK|4.0|My brother bought this album on vinyl when I was a kid and I was fascinated by it.  The lyrics and music were haunting and the art on the album cover (a man wrapped in metal strips, like a mummy) was eerie.  Listening to this album inspired me to go out and read Poe's collected works.  I was thrilled when I found that the music was available digitally.  Aside from the nostalgia factor, the music still holds up 30 years later.  My favorite has always been the haunting \\"Cask of Amontillado\\", but now as an adult, I can also appreciate the instrumental suite based on \\"The Fall of the House of Usher\\" which was on the B side of the album and which I rarely listened to back in the day.
B0017I1FP8|5.0|Chaos sits in a darkened corner of Gotham city, rubs its hands together and smiles. It's almost time. In a little while, the forces of insanity and madness will begin a twisted, enraged march through the town, burning it all to the ground as it offers a full challenge to the \\"Dark Knight\\" with a limitless grin and a semi-crazy school girl flicker of the eyelids.<br /><br />The Joker has arrived to town.<br /><br />James Newton Howard (The Sixth Sense, The Village, Collateral, etc.) and Hans Zimmer (Gladiator, Crimson Tide, The Thin Red Line, etc.) once again have seized the essential musical \\"nector of the gods\\" and given us mere mortals another taste of bliss with a score that will certainly rival any action-based film for years to come.

I'm Not a Hero - spells the anguish and darkness that both Batman and his enemies seem to share. A powerful montage of moods which range from a surreal set of ominous strings until being finally eclipsed by by an epic, almost chanting rhythm where we feel the defiance within Batman's soul.<br /><br />#3. Harvey Two-Face - a Newton Howard piece which illuminates the heroic side of the cities vigilant district attorney, Harvey Dent.<br /><br />#4. Aggressive Expansion - Zimmer roars out at us with this one. A powerful tune which combines sparse threads of the Batman theme with an otherworldly sense of anticipation.<br /><br />#5. Always a Catch - Opens with the Joker's delirious theme; closes with a quaint melody.<br /><br />#6. Blood on My Hands - another Harvey Dent theme. A haunting piece of strings give us the mood for just what Dent represents to the city and his importance to the people as a symbol of justice.<br /><br />#7. A Little Push - lacking a definitive structure, this song acts as a filler being only 2:42 long.<br /><br />#8. Like a Dog Chasing Cars - Truly one of the standout pieces to this score, this song attacks the listener with a quick-patterned rise that culminates in menacing dance into the world of both Batman and the Joker. A beautiful tune which shares both the definition of who Joker and Batman truly are, until finally giving way into a melody which stands alone as Batman's, essentially leaving his similarities to the Joker behind.<br /><br />#9. I am the Batman - short but powerful filler track.<br /><br />#10. And I Thought My Jokes Were Bad - only 2:30 long, still provides the listener with a concise ride into the realm of Gotham.<br /><br />#11. Agent of Chaos - Another multi-layered piece which pays initial homage to the Joker's random madness until giving way to the tragic outcome surrounding Harvey Dent.<br /><br />#12. Introduce a Little Anarchy - if ever there was a Zimmer Batman theme within the film, this would be it.<br /><br />#13. Watch the World Burn - Captures the horror of what the Joker is capable of doing. Truly one of the gems of the score, if not the most powerful track on the album.<br /><br />#14.

B00127RAJY|5.0|I recieved the DVD in a timely manner, and was thoroughly impressed.  I must own at 30 work out DVD's and this is the ONLY one where I sweated profusely in such a short period of time.  I've worked out for a much longer time and did not see or feel the way I do in just these 20 minutes exercises.  I am able to fit this into my morning workout and I look forward to it!  Which is new for me.  My only complaint is in the strength training portions, It seems like the triceps and calves do not get enough attention.  Most of the strength  (weighted) exercises cover multiple muscle groups, but you can still tell what Jillian is concentrating on.  There are no weighted \\"triceps specifically\\" excercises.  Same for calves.  Not to say she's not hitting on them at all, because she is!  It's just not as noticeable. So I just incorporated a couple sets of exercises at the end to cover these areas. Love it!
B0000CDL93|5.0|This controversial film by Oliver Stone on the JFK assasination has taken on a life all its own.  I recently saw it again on HD Net and I was drawn into it all over again by the brilliant performances, Stone's direction and the story itself.  Many people have criticized Stone for taking liberties with the story but this is not a documentary this is a drama!! Costner is brilliant in particular and his summation scene in court is belongs to his best work (also counting his role in Eastwood's \\"A Perfect World\\").  The aim of an artist is to make us question the truth and Stone has certainly succeeded at that.  Remember how many people felt the plot in \\"The Manchurian Candidate\\" grows eerily factual as time goes by!!  If you are repelled by the current events now unfolding before us--the Iraq war, the recession--do see this film again!!
B0010ZR160|4.0|I really wasn't that interested in watching GONE BABY GONE when my husband turned it on.  Very quickly, however, I was drawn into the intense drama on the screen.  This movie is emotional, heartbreaking, gut-wrenching, and extremely thought provoking.  It is not easy to watch.  But it is very much worth seeing.<br /><br />I like my movies to entertain me, teach me something, or make me think.  GONE BABY GONE definitely falls into that third category.  It is not always easy to define right from wrong, good from bad, black from white.  And when the life of a child is involved, the moral areas get grayer and grayer.  Is it right to commit a crime, if it will improve the life and happiness of a child?  This question is posed in many different ways in this film, and the answer is never clear or easy.<br /><br />Overall, the acting is very good.  Headliners Casey Affleck, Morgan Freeman, and Ed Harris give realistic, believable, heartfelt performances.  The supporting cast, including Amy Ryan, Amy Madigan, Michelle Monaghan, and John Ashton are all very strong and genuine.  In some cases, perhaps the performances were almost too realistic; I had some difficulty in a few places understanding the thick, almost mumbled, South Boston accent.<br /><br />First time director Ben Affleck does an outstanding job.  He navigates you through the multiple twists, turns, and reverse loops of this detective mystery thriller so well that you never quite see what is coming.  The end is disturbing, to say the least, and leaves you thinking hard, trying to decide what is \\"right.\\"  My husband and I are still debating this, and we will be for some time to come.  Highly recommended.

B001CDNL78|1.0|I love the music that the men in CSN&Y have made over the years including many of the incredible songs on this live recording. But, even as the current administration has made faulty decisions concerning the war and other issues, I have decided to make a personal protest over Neil Young's message this time on the grounds that Neil Young is a Canadian citizen and has no intention of becoming an American citizen (Time Magazine, Wednesday, Sept. 28, 2005). Neil has the right to free speech (a precious American won and maintained freedom). But until he becomes an American citizen as Graham Nash did in 1978, and as the others are by birth, his words ring shallow in my ears and heart. I say no, not this time, Neil.
B0016MJ6HY|2.0|You would think with such a powerful cast..Jude Law, Rachel Weisz, Norah Jones and Natalie Portman that there would be a script that could complement their talents.  Norah Jones is a woman trying to find herself and goes cross country before discovering that what she wanted was where she left it in NYC.  Jude Law does nothing more than smoke a few cigarettes, wipe bar tables and serve Blueberry pie.  This movie drags along and has a predictable ending.  There are much better rentals than this one.  Definitely do not buy!! Have you ever watched a romantic comedy that did not make you laugh?  I'll never try Blueberry pie again!!

0440243661|5.0|This was my first jack reacher novel. I picked it up in an airport and was unable to put it down.  I was mesmerized by Reacher and his ways.  I have since gone back and read the first three novels, Killing Floor, Die Trying and Tripwire.  I highly recommend all of these.  Lee Child definitley has a talent in getting his audience to pull for this \\"everyman\\" character.  I have read several authors...Grisham, Thor, Baldacci, Connelly, Crais, DeMille, Griffin,Flynn, Frey, Patterson etc and Child packs the same type of dynamo.  You won't regret reading his novels..

0131101633|5.0|Most people that are serious about C know about this book, often calling it \\"K & R\\" or \\"The Old Testament.\\" As the authors of this book are also the authors of the C language itself, it's kinda hard to find a \\"better\\" book on the subject. The first edition has some errors that were (hopefully) fixed in the 2nd edition.<br />If you are new to programming, or have only used Windows, you may be a little lost as this holds true to the UNIX methodology of doing one thing well, and that is to teach C. It doesn't bother with helping to teach editor tools and compilers, or even basic programming concepts, as those are out of scope and the intended audience already knows about those.<br /><br />This is a great book, and I wish more books on programming languages had the same approach to teaching syntax and its use.
0316143472|4.0|Fans of David Sedaris will recognize, among certain other similarities to Socrates, Sedaris' disregard for \\"the unexamined life.\\" In fact, it is Sedaris' unwavering introspection which sometimes fuels his critics' disdain--as if the act of writing directly from experience is somehow inferior to that of adopting the bogus omniscient voice so popular among hack columnists and Amazon.com reviewers such as this one.<br /><br />In reading Sedaris' work, expressing as it does the mechanics of a certain mode of existence, I've felt many moments of personal recognition and even identification--experiences that almost convince me that I actually know Sedaris, even with the potential of confusing me into believing that *he* knows *me*, which could result in either scary or embarrassing results were I to attend a book signing after consuming two or three martinis.<br /><br />Upon reading \\"Town and Country,\\" however, I experienced not mere identification but genuine illumination. Sedaris brings the reader to find commonality not with his own experience, nor even with the pathos of some family member or stranger, but with humankind itself.<br /><br />In *When You Are Engulfed in Flames*, Sedaris crosses the line from straight experiential reportage into ... well, wisdom. He does not preach. However, a life of introspection does seem, finally, to yield more profound results than this reader ever imagined.<br /><br />Not only is it well worth reading, but it reveals a life well worth living.
B0000ADY9I|5.0|This is the one with Statesboro Blues.  Recorded live over several nights at New York's Fillmore East in March 1971, this is the album that provided the Allman Brothers their first big break.  It captures the original six-piece band firing on all cylinders in their natural environment, the concert stage.  The Brothers could record three to five-minute studio songs fairly well, but this album catches the Brothers at their improvisational best.  The original release contained only seven songs, but two of those songs stretched out over nineteen minutes [You Don't Love Me, Whipping Post], a third song goes thirteen minutes [In Memory of Elizabeth Reed], and there's one eight-minute slow blues tune from T-Bone Walker [Stormy Monday].  There was so much material recorded during these shows, some of the songs had to be held over for the next ABB album, Eat a Peach.  Those songs included the Muddy Waters tune Trouble No More, the epic thirty-three minute Mountain Jam, and the Sonny Boy Williamson song that got me hooked on the Allman Brothers in the first place, One Way Out.  The live songs from Eat a Peach have since been included on the deluxe version of Fillmore East.  This gives the listener the full audio experience of what an Allman Brothers concert was like in the early 1970s.  You don't get to see the light show or the \\"twirlers\\" in the audience, but you don't get the \\"contact high\\" from all the secondhand marijuana smoke either.  This album is simply the Allman Brothers Band at its very best.
B0013LPS8Y|3.0|I was really excited to have the first three U2 albums remastered with bonus tracks for the first time. These are my favorite U2 records (I am off the train after The Joshua Tree) and the b-sides, single only cuts and live tracks are nice to have in one package. So, how did the band screw up War's bonus material? By including some lame New Year's Day Ferry Corsten remixes instead of the original 12\\" versions. It's really nothing short of a slap in the face to the fans, whom i'm sure would like to have seen only original period songs included. October makes the same mistake by adding the Common Ground remix of Tomorrow, but that's a minor quibble. And while I know it would have been impossible to get ALL the War versions on the 2nd cd, it would have been in keeping with the spirit of the records to just play it straight. A five star record knocked down to three - what a shame....The other cds BOY **** and OCTOBER *****
B000WGWQG8|4.0|I watched this on HBO and loved it. I purchased the DVD set for my dad for fathers day. He liked it so much he watched the entire series over a weekend. The acting is great and it really follows the biography well. Enjoy!
B000BB1MI2|1.0|That's the only way I can describe this remake with Johnny Depp.  This version lacks the charm, warmth and humor found in the original version with Gene Wilder.  Johnny Depp comes across cold and unfeeling without any enthusiasm thru out the whole entire movie.  The rest of the cast stunk just as well. I can't even imagine how this movie got the ratings that it did but I for sure will never watch this version again.
B000MR9D5E|5.0|I saw the preview for this series and decided I had to own it for the cinematography alone. After receiving it in the mail, I was not disappointed in the least. The photography is absolutely stunning, and the moments the Planet Earth team were able to capture are simply unbelievable.<br />Beyond being a great nature series, what I love about owning this boxed set, is it's something I will keep with me for a LONG time and be able to re-watch time and again. Not only is it something that I will be able to enjoy, but it's something that I can show to my kids someday that will be better than all the brain-sucking cartoons that are out these days.<br />Planet Earth is truly a classic.
B00005JPY0|5.0|After leaving the theater in 2005 nearly wiping tears from my eyes after watching the genius of Batman Begins, I said \\"part of me wishes they would never make another film because there's no way they could come close to the perfection of this movie\\".<br /><br />I was wrong.<br /><br />For the past 2 years I have been awaiting The Dark Knight with more excitement than any other movie in my life.  Searching the net daily for new information, watching the trailers around 500 times (no exaggeration) and following the genius viral marketing plan online, I knew that The Dark Knight would be an amazing effort and my expectations were through the roof.  I expected a nearly perfect movie and my expectations were EXCEEDED.<br /><br />To avoid spoiling this work of genius, a short recap is all I will provide.  After the events of Batman Begins the city is in chaos and a new threat emerges in the form of the psychotic Joker.  Wanting to inflict anarchy and disorder, the Joker has no real ulterior motives other than to cause trouble and misery for the residents of Gotham.  With the help of Lt. Gordon and newly elected DA Harvey Dent, the Batman faces his toughest nemesis ever as he tries to saved his beloved city so he can one day take off his mask for good and Bruce Wayne can be with his true love Rachel.<br /><br />Cast/Production Opinions<br />------------------------<br /><br />GENIUS<br /><br />Heath Ledger - Ledger's performance as The Joker quite simply is THE definitive take on the clown prince of crazy and a genius display of acting.  All the hype that has been directed at Ledger is not without merit.  Not only does Ledger give the greatest villain performance I have ever seen, he LIVES The Joker.  The little nuances, walks, grunts, etc. is absolute CANDY for the viewing audience.  If you have wanted a menacing Joker that cares about nothing and just wants to cause mayhem, this Joker will become THE Joker forever.  So much more than just a character, Ledger gives one of the great performances in film history.<br /><br />PERFECTION<br /><br />Gary Oldman - The 2nd best performance in the TDK and another amazing performance as Lt. James Gordon.  For anyone that is a fan of Batman Year One and the comics, you will appreciate Oldmans work nearly as much as Ledger.  Quiet, subdued, and wonderful, you CARE for Lt. Gordon and you are happy when things go his way.  This is an amazing work and can't be ignored.<br /><br />Location - Chicago really was a perfect place to film these movies.  The city looks amazing and you really feel like you are in Gotham.<br /><br />NEAR PERFECTION<br /><br />Christian Bale - Fantastic Bruce Wayne, perfect as Batman, obv the movies don't work if he doesn't.  On par with the greatness of his work in Batman Begins.  I don't think it's better work here, I think in both movies he is amazing equally.<br /><br />Michael Caine - Wonderful as Alfred as per usual.<br /><br />Christopher Nolan - Another wonderful job directing.  The IMAX shots really add to the film and the opening shots in IMAX make you go WOW.  Is Nolan capable of making a bad movie?<br /><br />Writing - Great script which is very dense.  This might not be for everyone but having a dense story done right only adds to the longevity of the film over time.<br /><br />Gadgets - The new Batpod and other cool stuff are still realistic and not over the top.  Any technology that is introduced in the movie serves a good purpose and makes sense.<br /><br />GREAT<br /><br />Aaron Eckhart - Great performance that makes you CARE about Harvey Dent and what he is trying to do for the city of Gotham.  At the end of the movie when he's not the same person that he was at the beginning he still gives a great performance<br /><br />Morgan Freeman - Such a great actor and he builds on his character from Batman Begins, very solid<br /><br />GOOD<br /><br />Maggie Gyllenhaal - This is one of the only weak parts of the movie.  I never criticized Katie Holmes in Batman Begins because I thought she did a fine job acting and her baby faced innocence I thought was a good match for Bruce Wayne.  I just thought she was too young.  I think Gyllenhaal was in a tough spot with this role.  She comes into TDK with a character already created and she doesn't seem sure how to act accordingly.  Does she be Dawes as Katie Holmes or a new version?  I think she's good in the movie but I would have rather had Holmes return.  She could have done so much more but I felt she was lazy in this role.<br /><br />The Dark Knight is THE definitive \\"super hero\\" movie but it is so much more.  You don't have to like Batman or super heroes to enjoy this film and it will be the quickest 2 1/2 hours of your life.  Any time Ledger is on the screen it's pure candy and he's on the screen just enough, making you yearn for more.<br /><br />Great story, incredible directing, amazing/great performances and the genius of Heath Ledger make this not only the best film of 2008 but one of the great movies of all time.  In terms of sequels it might BE the greatest sequel ever (I would put Godfather Part II and Aliens right up there as well) and it DOES live up to the hype.<br /><br />See The Dark Knight in IMAX if you can to enjoy the scenes filmed in this format, but make sure you see this movie over and over again.<br /><br />A masterpiece.<br /><br />***** NEAR PERFECTIONk Gyllenhaal was in a tough spot with this role.

B00005MCX2|5.0|This is the live album from the tour which Hawkwind funded from the profits of their top 3 hit 'Silver Machine' in 1972. There are god knows how many versions of this album, and IMHO they all sound pretty much the same, so go for the one with the most tracks.    This is often called Hawkwind's best album. Is it?    Well, it's hard to say. How can you compare this ballcrushing, chaotic, anarchic noise, poetry, sax squonks and synth wobblings with something like the hilarious, precise and shiny 'Quark Strangeness and Charm' (1977)? IMHO they are as good as each other. This is just the best of Hawkwind at a particular point in time.    That point was shortly after they'd added the monster rythm section of Lemmy (later of Motorhead) and Simon King (one of the most underrated and instinctual rock drummers ever), cranked up the volume to horrific levels, and committed the brilliant Robert Calvert to vinyl for the first time (he would later become the driving force of the band).    Basically, 'Space Ritual' is a unique, thunderous, ambient, totally mad document. Stoned poems alternate with blasting heavy metal space rock (and when we're talking 'Space Rock', Hawkwind are the true gods of the genre. How can you beat lines like 'Space is deep, it is so endless'?)    It's a shame the CD doesn't include a live show, with the nude dancer Stacia, and the amazingly wasted Dik Mik and Lemmy, who admitted that during the the recording of 'Silver Machine' he had to be propped up by roadies and told which direction the audience was in.    Above all, regardless of the style of the music, this is a document of a band who were utterly devoted to their music and audience, without a care for commercial success. The true 'people's band'. If the offer still exists of buying this along with 'Hall of the Mountain Grill' (their next LP), buy it. You'll also get HotMG, which for my money is the best of their early studio LP's.    To sum up: blistering, unique, amazing, but if you are after perfect musicianship and tightness, forget it. A classic. It just may not be your sort of classic.
B0019FOC5E|4.0|My major complaint with the CD is that it is missing music from the film - Overture, Chiquitita, I Do, I Do, I Do, I Do, I Do; - and it can't be because there isn't room on the CD since other CDs are way longer in content.  Thank You for the Music is added at the end although it isn't on the index.  Take a Chance on Me is also edited down on this recording... inexplicably so. I think part of the reason most of us buy soundtracks is to relive the performance, so why not include the best part of Walters' performance of the song?  Still the soundtrack is great for re-experiencing the fun of the film.    As for the review of Brosnan's and Firth's voices - I've seen the stage show at least a half dozen times and there were a couple of guys in those parts who shouldn't have been singing, either.  Firth's voice is actually quite sweet and works perfectly for Our Last Summer.  Brosnan should have had a better vocal coach (or more training) because there is a bit of braying in there; however, his performance is emotionally committed.      There were some stage numbers missing from the film so naturally they're   not on the film CD.
B001B71NOI|5.0|Good news, part 1: I agree that this is Reznor's tightest set of rock tunes in ages. Part 2: Check out the rehearsal footage on the bonus DVD. The band is air-tight, tough and exciting as ever. This bodes well for the upcoming tour. Part 3: The most important thing here is what Trent has been accomplishing since he gave his record company the bird. Without the pressures of corporate B.S., he has been more successful and creative than ever. No major label would have touched an uncommercial experiment like \\"Ghosts I-IV\\", and this freedom has re-energized him into rocking like a M.F. on this terrific new release. And as the last laugh, these releases are raking in millions! This bodes well not just for NIN, but for all truly talented artists who are tired of working for stuffed suits and seeing fans get ripped off. Like I said, good news all around!
B0014XCMVM|5.0|Alanis has had some \\"life changes\\" as of late as we all know.  In this CD she shares some of her innermost thoughts,feelings, and emotions.  Many people can whine,rant, and rave about things like these. She does none of this. Instead she places it all in perspective.  She is fantastic.  I did not like \\"Jagged Little Pill\\" at all.  However, this CD is beyond great.    This is a classic that will be played for years.  Her music will haunt you.  The emotions in the music are ones we all have.  She has simply taken them out of her heart and shared them with us-amazing.
B00175GAJ2|4.0|This is a German-Canadian production, and I believe that the German subtitle means \\"Power of the City\\".  \\"Metropolis\\" is another series which combines computer graphics, live actors and sets, and interviews with historians and archeologists to give a picture of life in cities of the classical age.  Similar series are \\"Engineering an Empire\\", \\"Secrets of Archeology\\", and \\"Ancient Discoveries\\".  Each of these series takes a slightly different approach, and each has its strengths and weaknesses.<br /><br />Compared to other series, \\"Metropolis\\" is focused on how these cities operated: what were the markets like, how were the streets laid out, how were basic services like sewer and water provided, how were they policed, etc.  While the approach is not exactly \\"what was daily life like\\", the series does try to show something about the culture, and sometimes the art and architecture, of the cities.  These episodes are very well written and do a good job of explaining what we know from archeology and history.  Sometimes this is a limitation, however.  For example, the section on Alexandria has a good deal about plumbing, which is what is left from classical Alexandria, everything else having been built over.  As the narration says, the city must have had magnificent buildings, but we have no idea what they looked like.  Personally, I would have much preferred that they showed their best guesses.<br /><br />One of the strengths of \\"Metropolis\\" is its superior computer graphics.  However, there is usually no more than a few minutes of this in each hour long episode.  I would have preferred more, and accordingly lowered my rating of this series.<br /><br />Disc 1 contains episodes on four classical Mediterraen cities: Athens, Rome, Carthage, and Alexandria.  For the cities of Athens and Rome, for which there is a great deal of information, in addition to the standard material you would expect, the series looks at some aspects which are not frequently covered (policing, unusalpublic building, etc.).  Not as much is known about Carthage and Alexandria and these episodes are more traditional.  As I mentioned above, I was disappointed in the Alexandria episode; even though it includes something about the famous library I do not feel this series did the library justice (the best treatment of the Alexandrian library I know of is in \\"Ancient Discoveries\\").<br /><br />Disc 2 covers three medieval cities: Constantinople, Venice, and Paris.  The Constantiople and Venice episodes are excellent, and the Constantiople episode is by far the best that I have seen on that city.  One of the techniques of the series is to tell a story set in the time period covered for each city.  Of course this is to help us get a sense of what life and culture was like then.  The story included for medieval Paris was that of Francois Villon.  While this is a fascinating story, I felt that the episode spent too much time on it, so that the episode became more about Villon that Paris.
0060899220|5.0|Great book lots of good info. I don't go to buffets and now I know I never will. It's just like sitting across from that sexy man and just listening to his stories. It's great.
B000WGWQG8|5.0|This is an EXCELLENT series!  Not only is it well acted, it is historically correct--something that's a rarity nowadays.  Anyone who enjoys history, loves our country or desires to know what all went into the founding of our country will want to see this series.
0307387178|4.0|It's rare that I'm motivated to both read a book and watch the same movie, but the Into the Wild movie was so impressive that I checked this book out from the library as well.  It fills in a lot of additional information in the storyline, but also has a few major shortcomings.    It was impressive to see the book elaborate so much on the McCandless family's history.  Krakauer went into much more detail in building up Walt and Billie as success stories in the American Dream, having both come up from working-class backgrounds in the West and Michigan respectively to run a lucrative consulting firm.  At the same time, he emphasized their tragic flaws in detailing how they carried on an affair and had illegitimate children, then hid the truth from those children.  I got the impression from both the book and the movie that there was a lot of self-centeredness and resentment around the household, both from Chris and from his parents.  We didn't see much more from Carine, though; she was a narrator who tried to be fair to both parties in the movie, and also didn't seem to take much of a side in the book.    Chris himself was also filled in around the edges a lot in the book.  The reader can see how his academic prowess came long before Emory, at Woodson High School--although his stubborn nature also did, as he had one F on his transcript in a physics class where he did not follow the format on lab reports.  His political views are shown as conflicted, as many young, intellectually curious men and women are; his tending to the poor is supplanted with an unusual combination of founding (re-founding?  Newt Gingrich was there once) the Emory College Republicans, railing against religious right leaders, and railing against \\"rich kids at Emory\\" in general (even if he was one himself.)  It has been debated on here whether McCandless' foolishness was a sign of liberalism or conservatism, and whether Dennis Kucinich supporter Sean Penn was trying to prove a point about materialismand upper-class suburbia in the movie, but some of the answers are right there.  McCandless is shown as emotionally distant, not much for human relationships or romance, and preferential of books over human friendship during his time at Emory, just as he was in the remaining two years of his life.  His spartan lifestyle is also exposed, as he had a bare-bones living in his Atlanta apartment, without even a telephone.  His trying relationship with his family is shown in even more detail; one has to wonder what led him to not have a potential \\"internship\\" with his parents' consulting firm during one of the summers that he instead drove across America the first time--an opportunity that would surely have helped him achieve his goals of attending Harvard Law School and becoming a great human rights attorney (not to mention he may have many more gaps of meaningful employment to explain from his final trip, had he returned alive.)  It is intriguing that the book explains how he nearly blew his cover and revealed his whereabouts to his parents, and that we find out what happened to his washed-out car (it is used as a police car.)    Many of the characters he meets along the way--Ron Franz and the hippies, for instance--are carried almost verbatim from the book to the movie, and they are also executed well here.  The book doesn't have Hal Holbrook delivering a phenomenal Franz performance, but it does allow the reader to emotionally connect with the minor characters, and sense their anxiety over Chris's abandonment of his family.  The farms of South Dakota are also portrayed well, as Chris's work ethic in comparison to other wanderers is described in more detail.  Much more detail is given to how poorly McCandless planned the Alaskan expedition, how he died, and how the natives of the state reacted (rightly and wrongly) to his blunders.    But the glaring flaw of the book is much of its midsection.  There was absolutely no reason that it had to talk about many other travelers, whose circumstances were only tangentially related to McCandless' (or even Krakauer's.)  Those chapters completely distracted from the book and added almost nothing to it.    However, due to the outstanding content of the rest of the book, which supplemented the content of the movie very well and both helped me loathe McCandless' disrespect for his family (as much as their own failings stood out) and his haphazard planning and execution of his trip, but also allowed me to identify a lot with his free spirit and intellectual nature, these chapters only subtract one star from an outstanding work.
B00005JKEZ|4.0|Well acted and enjoyable.  Done in the days when the story depended on good acting and no special effects.
0810993139|5.0|My 2 sons, ages 8 and 10, LOVED this book. They actually fought over it, since they both wanted to read it at the same time. Fighting over a book? This never happens at my house. Sure, they fight over the computer or Wii, or whose turn it is to feed the dog... but a book? Usually they argue with me why they don't need to read...Anyways, while they were reading the book, both of them shared some highlights with me and they were very funny. Of course, they refused to share any with me for this review, so you will just have to trust my recommendation. This would be a great book for the reluctant reader.
B000FVQM2Y|4.0|A throwback to detective noir flicks from the 30's and 40's set in a high school, this excellent movie keeps viewers glued with snappy dialogue and a sturdy plot.  Joseph Gordon-Levitt is wonderful as the outcast protagonist , walking a fine line between brooding and witty as he investigates his ex-girlfriend's disappearance.  Lukas Haas drops in as a quirky drug kingpin, and Richard Roundtree appears as the assistant Vice Principal.  A back and forth between Levitt and Roundtree in one scene is hilarious and makes the entire movie worth watching, let alone with the rest of this refreshingly different film.
B0013LPS7U|5.0|I can't claim to be a U2 fan since the beginning, and yeah, I jumped onboard with \\"The Joshua Tree\\".  Fine, bandwagon jumper.  However, back in 1987, someone sold me their collection of U2 7-inch vinyl from the US and Europe (and the War picture disc), and when the 1999 B-sides bonus disc on the 1980-1990 greatest hits collection missed out on some of the songs, I was a bit disgusted.      Now, these songs are finally coming out on CD (along with other material from the vaults).  Some of it is dicey.  \\"Boy-Girl\\" is hideous, but hearing Bono sounding like every bit a teenager is pretty funny.  You'll probably be embarrassed for him when you hear this.  However, when bonus CDs are added to a release like this, they're supposed to give you everything, and good for the band for allowing this to be released.  It has to make them cringe, but so what?    Personally, I think the bonus disc is worth it just for the inclusion of the original version of \\"11 O'Clock Tick Tock\\".  It's a harmless enough song, but it is catchy.  Hearing something like this from way back in the beginning, then hearing how the band developed through the 80s is a great story in itself.  The other bonus material here is worth having as well.     I've always thought that it would be a trip to listen to U2 from 1979 through 1988 (including Rattle and Hum), the albums and the B-sides, to hear how this band evolved and matured.  Now we can finally retrace the whole thing.  I'm sure \\"The Unforgettable Fire\\" will get a similar treatment next year for its 25th anniversary, and that should finally fill in all the gaps.
B001AW9DKK|3.0|Neil Young may not be a citizen of the U.S. but I am and I agree with most of what Neil Young says. This seems like a pretty good representation of what the 2006 tour was all about, but I am disappointed that the album doesn't include \\"The Restless Consumer.\\" That song seemed one of the highlights of the show.
B0013LPS8Y|5.0|Call me a nitpicker, but I would still like to know why this remastered version isn't the same as the MFSL gold CD.  I have that one as well, and unfortunately it's still the gold standard.  I say unfortunately because it's so hard to come by without forking over a week's paycheck, and while I'm lucky enough to have it, it would have been nice to give everyone a chance to hear the album that way.      I just wish they would have put the full version of \\"Seconds\\" as is on the MFSL version.  Original LP (and CD) pressings listed the song as 3:24, but that version never showed up til the Mobile Fidelity version came out.  Also, the gold version's \\"Like A Song\\" is 5:00, while \\"New Year's Day\\" is 5:38 (four extra beats before Edge's solo in the middle of the song).  Sounds trivial, but it raises the question, if the original master tapes were used for this version while Mobile Fidelity also claimed to use the original masters, why the discrepancy?  There were timing errors on three other songs as well, so if you're looking for the 5-minute version of \\"Two Hearts...\\" or the 6-minute \\"Surrender\\", there's apparently no such animal.      But it's still a five star release and even though it might seem redundant to put ALL those remixes of \\"New Year's Day\\" and \\"Two Hearts Beat As One\\", I'd rather have everything out there for completists sake.  I was lucky in 1987 to buy someone's U2 collection on 7-inch back to the U23 EP and even though the value on those singles might be diminished by these songs finally being available on CD, I don't care.  If you enjoy the B-sides from these new remasters, wait until The Unforgettable Fire gets the deluxe treatment.  I'd guess next year where it's the 25th anniversary.
B000244FDW|5.0|I first saw this version on Masterpiece Theater in the early 80's when I was in high school.  I had not read the book yet at that time but I was quite captivated by Elizabeth Garvie's portrayal of Elizabeth Bennet.  (My being a 16 year old boy also might have had something to do with it.) Unfortunately I missed the final episode so I had to get the book.  I have lost count how many times I have read it since. It is by far my favorite book which is a little odd since I tend to read Sci-Fi and Fantasy books usually.     I bought the VHS set as soon as it was available for both the 1980 and 1995 productions and I now own all three of the newer versions on DVD.   I watched them all this weekend and found myself unintentionally comparing them.  What I found is that, while I like them all, the 1980 adaptation is my favorite by a small margin over the 1995 one.  The 2005 has it's merits and I really do like Keira Knightly as Elizabeth.  Of the three she is the only one who acts like she is truly not yet one and twenty :-).    It seems to me that the 1980 version is a tad closer to the book than the 1995 version in terms of the dialogue and the use of actual lines from the book.  The production and scenery in the 1995 and 2005 versions are better than the 1980 one but the wit and humor are what carries the story for me and that is what ultimately leads me to enjoy the 1980 version best.    As to the character portrayals I prefer the following:    Mr. Collins, Mrs. Bennet, Caroline Bingley, Louisa Hurst, Charlotte Lucas, Wickam, Mr. and Mrs. Gardiner - The1980 version    Darcy, Bingley, Lady Catherine and Anne DeBourgh, Gorgianna Darcy, Sir William Lucas, Mr. Bennet, Mr. Hurst - The 1995 Version    Jane Bennet - The 2005 version    Elizabeth Bennet - Too close to call 1980 and 2005    In any case I think that anyone who enjoys the book (please, please read it if you haven't and if you have, read it again) should add this to their collection.
B000UNYJXQ|5.0|Must watch to understand...<br />I am an Italian, that came to live in the US in 2000. I have being living here for almost 10 years, and I think that Health care is the thing where the US is most backward compared to Europe. When I came here it didn't take me long to start appreciating what we have in Italy. People in Italy generally don't complain too much about their health care, it works, there are occasionally news on \\"errors\\" in hospitals, or long waits at ER's or stuff like that, but generally it works... People get cured no matter who they are, and they don't have to worry about bills. Seen from my Italian eyes, that aspect of the US life was amazingly conflicting to many others things where the US is more advanced: in Italy you have to spend over $500 in order to get a driver license, and you have to go through medical exam, walk to at least 3 offices before you get it, and you still have to wait weeks before you can drive... In California $12 and about 1 hour in 1 DMV office, and you walk out with a temporary DL. But when it comes to health care, it's almost scary to live in the US. My family, when they came to visit me here, they were really afraid, so they got an insurance (in Italy) for heath emergency, but they were still afraid because in case something happened they had to pay out of pocket, and then ask for a reimbursement in Italy. That's different than traveling to many other countries. If you travel to France, Germany, even Australia, you don't have to worry about paying (if you are an Italian citizen) because there is an agreement of reciprocal care... Like in the movie the Canadian couple that goes to SEARS to buy insurance. This is just one of the many issues... I could go on forever. The US must grow from this point of view, a country that is modern and advanced in many aspects (that's why I work here, for the hi-tech industry), it's almost like a 3rd world country when it comes to health care...
B000P12LWY|4.0|Wonderful price for such an amazing, extravegent show! Every episode was better than the next, in that the drama only intensified.  The only downside to the item is the lack of bonus features, but the episodes themselves make up for it.
0743290119|4.0|This is just like all the other single gal in NYC books. I love them all and I thought this was a good addition. It is a quick and easy read and was an overall good book. All these books start to blend in together after a while but I continue to enjoy new ones. It is a nice escape!
015206396X|5.0|I LOVED Graceling! If you are looking for a new fantasy series, look no further!     Katsa is a fascinating character that I sometimes feel I can relate to, and who sometimes feels so amazingly foreign, and in such a refreshingly different way than Tolkien's elves (and so many other fantasy characters) do. I love the concept of a Grace, it is a new and unique twist into the realm of fantasy. The characters are wonderfully built, as is the land of seven kingdoms, and the political interactions throughout.     I was quite excited to discover on Ms. Cashore's web-site that a prequel, Fire, is coming in the future, as well as a sequel! This was a great read, and I would recommend it for any YA readers and adults as well!
B000MR9D5E|5.0|This product, the Planet Earth series is phenominal. The footage, scenery and commentary by David Attenborough are outstanding. For those who do not have it, you are missing out on the beauty this planet has to offer.
0679731725|5.0|I love this book.  I read one of Ishiguro's other novels, Never Let me Go, and I liked it.  But I don't know if I loved it.  The story was compelling, and very original, but I don't know how much I identified with the main character.    The Remains of the Day is a different story.  The protagonist Mr. Stevens is the epitome of the professional butler- always prepared, composed, diligent, loyal.  And he possesses the combination of dedication to and pride of his profession that he fondly refers to as dignity.  The book places you as the reader of about a week's worth of entries in his journal which follow him on a sort of professional-errand-turned-cathartic-journey through the country.  At first, I formed a deep respect for Mr. Stevens, and was completely taken by his deep expertise, superhuman work ethic, and rational mindset.  Not to mention his charming manners.    However, there are subtle hints that he is not being wholly honest in conveying his thoughts and feelings.  Not that he intends to deceive the reader; his dishonesty is completely internal, rooted in his tendency to rationalize and suppress all traces of emotions and doubts which would be detrimental to his profession.  This becomes evident only because he recounts faithfully his dialogues with others.  They are charged with emotions and intentions which go completely ignored by his explanations.  At some points, he had me cringing with sympathy.  But we must at least give him credit for not altering the dialogue in any conscious way.    As the journey progresses, the fresh air, kind strangers, and beautiful landscapes allow him to become more honest with himself-- to, for once in too long a while, put aside his profession to remember his humanity.  It's a somewhat relieving development.  However, it reveals the somewhat tragic reality of a life spent in total, blind dedication to one's work.  He finally allows this reality to come crashing down on him at the end of his trip.  Fortunately though, the book ends with some hope as he regains his composure and a renewed motivation for his profession.
0060512806|5.0|I loved this book.   It seems like most reviewers who enjoy Cryptonomicon are involved heavily in some type of geeky activity, so this review is for the other people out there, people like me, who ask only \\"Does it work?\\", not, \\"How does it work?\\"  This book, with all of its in-depth explanations for questions I never thought to ask, was incredibly engaging. It has an enormous plotline that spans several decades, yet does eventually tie in together. There are lots of \\"Aha!\\" moments, as well as several where you ask \\"How did he DO that?\\"   I loved it so much that I bought it for my husband, a computer geek, and my dad, definitely not a computer geek, for their father's day gifts. It is looong, but unforgettable. The best way to read this book is in big stretches, so carve out some time, put your feet up, and get ready to lose yourself in a place where eating cereal has a mathematical precision that will amaze you.   And if you don't like it, you can always use it to prop open doors.
B000024D4R|5.0|I became introduced to this album long after I listened to The Wall. Up until then The Wall & the Dark Side of the Moon were the only Pink Floyd I owned or heard. A friend played this album in review for me and I had to have it as part of my collection. I do not believe you'll find any of the tracks on some sort of greatest hits cd. I would encourage a Pink Floyd collector to add this cd as it is definitely a classic!
B00005JPY0|5.0|I've been saying for over a year that this was going to be my 'event' movie of 2008.  My anticipation has been on a slow burn for quite some time.  I knew that this film was going to blow me away from the moment that I saw the trailer for it preceeding &#34;I Am Legend&#34; back in December, well before all the hype surrounding Heath Ledger's passing.  The funny thing is, though, that I didn't get truly jazzed until I saw the huge 20'x8' poster that my local theater had in a corridor.  There, as I waited to see &#34;Indiana Jones and the Kingdom of the Crystal Skull,&#34; I truly started hopping in my shoes to see THIS movie.  The poster showed the Joker holding up a burning playing card, Batman holding up a Batarang and Aaron Eckhart holding up a campaign button that said &#34;I Believe in Harvey Dent.&#34;  The reference, taken directly from the graphic novel &#34;The Long Halloween&#34; which I'd read for the first time earlier this year, I recognized instantly.  And as the wave of other comic book adaptations came along this summer, I kept telling people to just wait.  The best hasn't arrived yet.  Well, now it has, and the waiting was worth it.  The hype is to be believed.  From Christopher Nolan, I expected no less.  Every one of his films has left me with a deep desire, as the credits roll, for more.  Insomnia, Memento, The Prestige, Batman Begins; all conveyed that incredible sense of telling a story while asking difficult questions.  He doesn't make movies for short attention spans; and this film is no exception.  So, I've now seen this film twice.  I missed all the midnight show madness, but I'm sure it would have been glorious fun.  Both times that I have seen it, though, were packed; and the audience was paying attention.  Be warned, however, this movie is not for small kids.  I noticed a few parents in the audiences I attended with making a point of turning the heads of their kids away during some of the more disturbing scenes.  This is that rare film that transcends its own genre, that defies strict classification as any one thing.  Yes, it has comic book/superhero origins, but it is so much more than an adaptation of that medium.  It's so much more than a crime drama or an action film or any other classification one wishes to place it in.  However one chooses to box up this film, it's going to wiggle free of it.  It's just several orders of magnitude more than the sum of its parts.  Now, about those parts.  The cast is a wonder to behold, a true masterstroke.  Christian Bale conveys the inherant duality of the title character with equal parts pinache for Bruce Wayne, and determined angst-driven alertness for Batman.  Gary Oldman, I swear he looks like he's been lifted right from the panels of Frank Miller's iconic story Batman: Year One for the part of Gordon.  Michael Caine and Morgan Freeman, well, what else can be said of these two distinguished men who carry their supporting roles with dignity and authority.  Maggie Gyllenhaal was bound to draw jeers and cheers for replacing Katie Holmes, and here her character is given less to do; though she carries the part with truly conflicted emotions as she watches the two men she cares most for slowly decend into the madness the events of the film creates.  Aaron Eckhart begins the movie with confidence, and perfectly conveys that steady fall into crazed lunacy as his world is slowly ripped up around him, culminating in his own horrible injury.  Finally, we come to the late Heath Ledger.  Even if he hadn't passed away prematurely, this would have been a career defining role for him.  There would still be Oscar hype for him in the role of the Joker.  This is the Joker of recent comic stories.  Unpredictable, wholly dedicated to wreaking havoc, and all the while making the reader/viewer feel creeped out one moment, making them laugh the next, and making you hate yourself for laughing in the next instant.  This is a performance that truly must be seen and absorbed to bebelieved.  In all the technical areas, this film doesn't disappoint.  I can't give this less than a 5 star rating.  Repeat viewings are kind of a must, because there are a lot of things that the attentive viewer will notice from one viewing to the next.  This is it folks:  The film of the year.  This is a movie that will inspire some thought; that will exhilarate and haunt you, and it's so much more than the hype.  It truly must be seen on a big screen in a room full of people paying attention.  Don't miss this one.
B00005JPY0|5.0|This should be the last Superhero film that is ever made. There is no way to follow \\"The Dark Knight\\".    I was originally a critic of the choice of Heath Ledger as the Joker, but I come out of this film an admirer. His performance in this movie is truly disturbing--giving no sense that there is a human being (much less an actor) behind that makeup.     The word \\"dark\\" is thrown around a lot nowadays to describe movies. They called the first Batman movie \\"dark\\", because Tim Burton directed it. But it was only dark compared to the television show. What \\"Dark Knight\\" is, is \\"brutal\\"-- a cross between \\"Saw\\" and an Ayn Rand novel.     It is also a great action film. Much of the fighting is bone-crushing, hand-to-hand combat, perfectly in keeping with the tone of the film.    One of the greatest things about \\"Dark Knight\\", though, is that, despite its \\"darkness\\", it  resists the easy path of being merely a nihilistic freak show. It pays tribute to heroism and asserts a core goodness within humanity that makes this film, ultimately, uplifting.    The character of Batman has long appealed to many as an \\"anti-hero\\", a force against evil who is only arguably better than the evil he fights. I believe that, in the \\"Dark Knight\\", Batman is finally portrayed as a TRUE hero, dropping, finally, the \\"anti.\\" He is, literally, a Knight. (The Joker, of all people, is able to discern this about Batman when he correctly identifies him as being \\"incorruptible.\\")    This is really what the film is all about, I think. Deep down, people want TRUE heroes, worshiping anti-heroes only because they are afraid to believe in the real thing.     What is a Knight, but a hero you can really believe in?
B00005JPY0|5.0|Long have we waited for a Batman movie this good. It seems that the perfect Batman movie -- that which gets the legend right, does it intelligently and is still a complete thrill ride -- was beyond us from the get-go. Tim Burton tried, oh he tried, with \\"Batman\\" in 1989. Yeah, that movie was good. Jack Nicholson, Michael Keaton, a brooding Batman, blah blah blah. And then there was \\"Batman Returns\\" and if you like your Batman dark, well, this was a cup of black coffee. However, since dark and moody films don't sell action figures, Joel Schumacher was brought in for the next two, and decidedly campier sequels -- \\"Batman Forever\\" and \\"Batman & Robin\\" -- effectively killing off the franchise and leaving it for dead for eight long years. When Christoper Nolan brought Batman back to the big screen in 2005 with the critically acclaimed (hey, Ebert liked it) \\"Batman Begins,\\" it was a breath of fresh air. With Christian Bale as the caped crusader, and a top-notch supporting cast, we were finally given a Batman film with class. The only downside is, it didn't quite deliver all the goodies one would expect from a Batman film. Enter 2008 and here we are with what is easily the most hyped movie of the year, and surely, the best action/adventure/comic-book/whatever to come out in years, \\"The Dark Knight.\\"<br /><br />Christian Bale reprises his role as Bruce Wayne/Batman, with other \\"Begins\\" alumni Michael Caine, Gary Oldman and Morgan Freeman bringing their supporting roles back to life, too. Unfortunately (or perhaps fortunately) Katie Holmes is too busy trying to keep Tom Cruise from going 'batty' again, so the much more credible Maggie Gyllenhaal has stepped into her previous role as Bruce Wayne love interest/Gotham City public servant Rachel Dawes, while Aaron Eckhart plays Harvey Dent, a hero gone tragically wrong. However, the true centerpiece of this film, and that which it will go down in history for, is the late Heath Ledger as The Joker. No doubt, this is his legacy -- the role he will be remembered for -- and with so many great actors at hand, it's amazing how he just steals each and every scene he is a part of.<br /><br />As a sequel to \\"Batman Begins,\\" \\"The Dark Knight\\" ups the ante on everything. First off, Christian Bale is much more natural this time around as The Caped Crusader, while Gyllenhaal -- although downplayed -- lends the film a little more maturity than Holmes could have. Aaron Eckhart is the unsung hero of the film, overshadowed, to say the least, by Ledger's Joker. Eckhart handles the neccessary duality of the character with ease and keeps you sympathetic to his cause even through the final scenes. Now, as for Ledger's Joker, where do you begin? To say this is a far cry from Jack Nicholson's interpretation would be an understatement. Let's just say that this Joker makes Jack's version look like Cesar Romero. This version of the character is less interested in the usual criminal activities like getting money and killing innocent citizens. This Joker is more of a Tyler Durden in \\"Fight Club\\" character. He seems more interested in shaking up society and making the citizens of Gotham City question their most basic values and reasons for existing. Ledger gives the performance it's all, and it shows. He is mesmerizing in each scene and steals the show, whether he was trying to or not.<br /><br />As a director returning to the franchise, Christopher Nolan seems just as confident and consistent as he did with the first film. \\"The Dark Knight\\" keeps in tone and consistency with \\"Begins\\" and the anticipation we felt at the end of that film is delivered upon ten-fold. The action scenes themselves are a blast, and quite the step-up from before, I might add. As mature as this film may be, there are definitely some jollies to be derived from seeing The Joker handle a bazooka inside a moving vehicle. Nolan handles the action sequences with ease, and they are just as memorable as the characters themselves. Of course, this is apretty violent and disturbing film at times, so you might want to think twice about bringing a small child to see it, even after you bought him those nifty Dark Knight underoos at Target.<br /><br />Now, as for the plot of the film, I'm not gonna dig into that. There are plenty of reviews that go into it, and as someone who purposely avoided any details of this film's plot as possible prior to it's release, I found that not having too much previous knowledge made it a much more enjoyable movie-going experience. To say the least, this is the definitive Batman film. I didn't need to write a review to tell you that, and you didn't need to read it to know it. It just is. It dwarves even Tim Burton's creation and more than makes up for abysmal failures of past. Some could take issue with it's length -- clocking in at over two and a half hours -- but the film is so good, I kept hoping against hope that it wouldn't end. There is simply so much going on in this film, so not only is the length a good thing, but it also warrants repeat viewings. If nothing else I have said has convinced you, let me just say this: Believe the hype.sturbing film at times, so you might want to think twice about bringing a small child to see it, even after you bought him those nifty Dark Knight underoos at Target.

B00005JPY0|3.0|Flawed masterpiece? No. Muddled attempt at brilliance? Yes. (As a side note, I challenge anyone to explain to me how the f*@# this movie landed a PG-13 rating).<br />The film is not bad, and Ledger is absolutely mesmerizing in his Joker incarnation. However, the film suffers from massive flaws which show up early and often. The film dumps all semblance of narrative coherence about an hour in and begins to unravel. Sadly, this unraveling reveals an empty core inside an integument of glitz, glamour, explosions and depth. Characters are annoyingly beamed from one place to another with no explanation, only to have lazy, dull dialogue fill in the pieces. There is no focus, no tautness. Nolan attempts to serve a three course meal, when he might have been better served (no pun) focusing on a single course. One can imagine how much better the film would be if it focused on Batman's battles with the Joker, instead of twisting itself into a philosophical pretzel.<br /><br />More annoying than the lack of coherence is the attempted profundity of the dialogue. Every character babbles self-important, pseudo-deep nonsense. The peanut buttery flotsam of dialogue gets so thick it is hard to take seriously. Some lines border on being hillarious inspite of their best effort. Take this gem from the Joker:<br />\\"You've changed things... forever. There's no going back. See, to them, you're just a freak... like me!\\"<br /><br />Yeah, I can really imagine a psychopathic lunatic uttering such nonsense! This is the type of analysis you expect from some vapid Freud wannabe. Even giving the Joker the benefit of the doubt as a symbolic character, it is a bit much.<br /><br />How about this precious line from Harvey Dent:<br />\\"You either die a hero or you live long enough to see yourself become the villain.\\"<br /><br />Wow! This is less meaningfull than roasting a marshmallow in the bathtub and a lot more irritating. In fact, Harvey Dent's story is about as enjoyable as rubbing sandpaper on your forehead. Sadly, we are supposed to think of him as a hero. Unfortunately, like Victor Lanslow in Casablanca, we despise his white knight do-goodery.<br /><br />Aside from the margarine sticks called dialogue, the themes explored in The Dark Knight seem as if they were written down on a post it note by a sophomore who had just inhaled too much hippie lettuce (the duality of all people, collateral damage, greed, fate, the kinship between good and evil and so on. As another aside, although I don't think the Joker is a trope for Al Queda, there are less than subtle linkages between Gotham and post 9-11 New York). The semi-intelligent audience member can't help but feel like he or she is getting talked down to. Do we really need everything spelled out for us? And, if we do, does it really need to be so Coppolaesque?<br />I was entertained through large swaths of this movie, but I found myself repeating one of the Joker's lines over and over: \\"Why.....so......serious?\\"k of him as a hero.

0199535574|4.0|So you want to read SENSE AND SENSIBILITY. Great choice! Jane Austen's first published novel (1811) can get lost in the limelight of her other `darling child', PRIDE AND PREJUDICE, but is well worth the effort. There are many editions available in print today, and the text can stand on its own, but for those seeking a `friendlier' version with notes and appendixes, the question arises of how much supplemental material do you need, and is it helpful?<br /><br />One option is the Oxford World's Classics new revised edition of SENSE AND SENSIBILITY that presents an interesting array of additional material that comfortably falls somewhere between just the text, and supplemental overload. This volume offers what I feel a good edition should be, an expansive introduction and detailed notes supporting the text in a clear, concise and friendly manner that the average reader can understand and enjoy.<br /><br />The material opens with a one paragraph biography of the life of Jane Austen which seemed rather slim to this Austen enthusiast's sensibility, and most certainly too short for a neophyte. The introduction quickly made up for it in both size and content at a whopping 33 pages! Wow, author Margaret Anne Doody does not disappoint, and it is easy to understand why after eighteen years publishers continue to use her excellent essay in subsequent editions.<br /><br />Amazingly, the introduction is not at all dated. The material covered is accessible to any era of reader, touching upon the novels publishing history, plot line, character analysis, and historical context. Doody thoughtfully presents the reader with an analysis of the major themes in the novel such as; the dichotomy of sense and sensibility as it relates to the two heroines Elinor and Marianne, the portrayal of negligent mothers, men represented as the ultimate hunter, secrecy, deceit and concealment, and the crippling impact of the inheritance laws and primogeniture on women during the Regency era. Interlaced with Doody's interpretations are her astute observations of Austen's writing style with references to pages in the novel and outside sources. The entire essay is well researched, populated with footnotes, and an enjoyable complement to the text.<br /><br />The notes on the text explain the editorial trail since the novel's first publication in 1811, whose subtle changes and their significance might baffle the nonscholars! Moody. The select bibliography is indeed select, and includes many editions that deserve recognition as the best of what is available in print on Jane Austen's life, works and critical analysis. One of my favorites listed is JANE AUSTEN: A FAMILY RECORD (1913) by William Austen-Leigh and Richard Arthur Austen-Leigh, revised and enlarged by Deirdre Le Faye (1989). I was also pleasantly surprised to see a category including film versions and commentaries which is often overlooked by other publishers.<br /><br />The chronology of Jane Austen's life lists both significant events and what transpired historically in matching columns. The choices are relevant and interesting with the exception of two events that this writer found humorous; - 1795 Jane Austen flirts with Tom Lefroy, and in 1815 Humphry Davy invents miner's safety lamp. I have yet to be convinced that Austen's flirtation with Tom Lefroy had a significant impact on her life, nor am I clear how a clergyman's daughter living in southern England would be directly affected by the invention of a miner's safety lamp. Just thinking out loud here!<br /><br />The two appendixes on rank and social status, and the intricacies of country dance touched upon both subjects clearly, but briefly, using stories from Jane Austen's life to put the era in context. I appreciated the humorous example of how young women attending balls and assemblies were accompanied by chaperones, usually a mother or an older woman, who were expected to pass the time with cards or socializing rather than dancing themselves. In a letter to her sister Cassandra, thirty-seven year-old Austen recognizes the transition from dancer to on-looker when she writes \\"Bye the bye, I must leave off being young, I find many Douceurs in being a sort of Chaperon for I am put on the Sofa near the Fire & can drink as much wine as I like.\\" Too funny! Even though each of these appendixes is short, they do offer a list of books to explore further reading, which I was inspired to investigate.<br /><br />Since contemporary novels do cease to be contemporary the day that they are published, growing even more distant with each generation, notes can become indispensible to the enjoyment of the modern reader. Prof. Claire Lamont has supplied excellent and insightful explanatory notes, allowing for instant gratification with detailed descriptions of language usage, social and historical context, and character and plot insights. I found this the most interesting aspect of this edition, and reading the explanatory notes alone was like reading a condensed dictionary to Jane Austen, her times, and the plot and characters in SENSE AND SENSIBILTY.<br /><br />In short, Oxford World's Classics has pulled together just the right amount of supplemental material from reputable and readable sources for their revised edition of SENSE AND SENSIBILTY. I found very little wanting in this edition, and recommend it to first time readers, or veterans seeking new insights.<br /><br />Laurel Ann, Austenproseetter to her sister Cassandra, thirty-seven year-old Austen recognizes the transition from dancer to on-looker when she writes \\"Bye the bye, I must leave off being young, I find many Douceurs in being a sort of Chaperon for I am put on the Sofa near the Fire & can drink as much wine as I like.\\" Too funny!

B00140PK6O|5.0|We absolutely loved this series. It was very clever and entertaining. It was well cast and acted and my husband even loved it.
078401213X|5.0|The grainy black and white photography in this film is just one of its many compelling aspects.  It's all about mathematics, the number Pi, Euclid, Pythagoras, the Golden Ratio, the spiral pattern, Jewish mysticism, the stock market, and a very strange computer operated by a troubled man, Max Cohen.  A shadowy group wants the information in his mind:  a 216-digit number that is apparently the key to a lot of things--and spells out the true name of God, according to a Rabbi.  Max suffers in the meantime from excruciating headaches, possibly the result of having stared into the sun when he was a small boy.  But he's also got a strange welt/mark on his scalp that may have something to do with his problems too.<br />If you don't mind doing some thinking while watching a film, then this is a good choice for you.  Don't expect everything to get tied up neatly at the end; this is not standard fare.
B00004VEPS|5.0|Here is a repackaged version of Ferenc Fricsay's Dvoark \\"New World\\" Symphony No. 9, Smetana Moldau, and Liszt Les Preludes, recorded in 1959-60 with the Berlin Philharmonic. These recordings have been in publication almost consistently since they first arrived on DG LP way back when, and for good reason -- this is one of Fricsay's most cherished recordings.<br /><br />For those that have never been exposed, the Hungarian Friscay (pronounce free-SHOY) came out of the postwar boomlet of conductors, what we know today as the golden age of orchestral conductors in Europe. This was the time of Furtwangler, Karajan, Bohm, Solti, Bernstein, Szell and many other of the biggest name conductors in history. Friscay built his reputation through a highly romanticized approach that features a lot of rubato -- most of which would be considered inappropriate in today's period performance influenced epoch -- and orchestral modulations that made any band sound much bigger than they are. He had a working relationship wtih a new orchestra of the time -- the RIAS, or Radio in the Amercian Sector orchetra.<br /><br />I first came to know the Fricsay style through his LP of Beethoven's Symphony 7 with BPO on the DG label. Here was highly measured and controlled Beethoven most of the way through with little of the dance rhythm some conductors find in the score. At the very end, Fricsay let it rip and things changed dramatically, builidng a fire-breathing and hair-raising conclusion that renedered the whole thing unforgettable.<br /><br />You hear these tactics most effectively here in the finale of the New World symphony where the conductor waits a tad longer than most to implement the horn blasts after the opening string sequence. Put most directly, Fricsay is simply more exciting in this music than other conductors and he got the 1959 Berlin Philharmonic to play it his way, including a wailing woodwing during the transition between opening and second ideas in the finale. In my opinion, the Berlin Philharmonic has never sounded better for any conductor than they sound for Fricsay in this recording. It is alive and human, 180 degrees from the ultrasmooth Mercedes on the Autobahn approach of Karajan.<br /><br />The new issue in DG's \\"Collection du millenaire\\" packaging comes in a slimline hard plastic container and only contains a page of notes in French. I assume Amazon imported this because the original DG issue -- the one with Fricsay's bald head on the cover -- is now only available via an expensive Australian import. As you probably noted when you checked this out, this one is quite a bit less expensive. It's definitely worth it since the remastering seems to be a bit improved. Even if not, you get one of Ferenc Fricsay's best-ever recordings and one of the most original New World symphonies in existence.he Berlin Philharmonic has never sounded better for any conductor than they sound for Fricsay in this recording.

6301971272|5.0|I first saw this movie in 1968 when I returned from Vietnam,<br />It was one of the best cowboy shoot em ups I had seen then and yuppers now 40 years later it still is among the best of the best.<br />  Eastwood is hard core at his best!!.<br /> I have wanted to buy this entire series for all of this time,finally I bought this one and the 2 others exactly like it in it's series.<br /> They are by the way the best ones of those I reviewed, they are as great now to watch as they were then...<br />  I seldom watch movies twice, this is a exception it's very well done.<br />I love my copy and the others in the series
B0000DIJO2|5.0|This is an excellent DVD. It is one of the best of the Bee Gee's.
9626343346|5.0|Hound of the Baskervilles is a wonderfully exciting story.  Watson spends a lot of the book without Holmes so there's a little less pretentiousness than usual.  The reading is done very well, though why the English think we Americans speak with such nasal voices I'll never understand.  I highly recommend this audio version.
B000RG1DD0|4.0|This is really a materwork. I will do some comments about the recording itself. I usually buy japanese editions, beacause they are beautiful mini-lp editions in many cases and the sound is usually better than the USA or european edition. It is not the case. Both the \\"old friends\\" and \\"the columbia studio recordings 1964-1970\\" sound clearly better. The remaster done by Vic Anesini is really superb, and something is lost in the japanese edition (in theory the same remaster). My recomendation would be \\"the columbia studio recordings\\", it sounds fantastic, you have all the titles in beautiful mini-lp editions and the price is now very good.
0596007124|5.0|I'm relatively new to Design Patters. Prior to reading this book I had read several other material on the web trying to get my head around design patterns and although that material was helpful, it didn't fully clarify to me the intent and usages of these patterns. However, when I read a sample chapter of this book online (on the Decorator Pattern), I instantly took a liking to it. The book has a very good way of explaining everything step by step and in a way that will make the topic more interesting to grasp.   I highly recommend this book to anyone who is new to the subject and wants to learn Design Patterns. This book (as even the authors mention) is not meant to be a reference book for professionals who already know about patterns. I think it's more suited to people who want to learn them from the ground up. I would give it 10 stars if I could.
B000MRAAJM|5.0|This is what 1080p is all about.  The pic is amazing, so clear on my 52\\" Sony Bravia using my PS3.  I could watch this over and over.  I have had friends and family watch this and they all get amazed on how good the quality looks but also how good of a movie this is.  I am a discovery show kinda guy so I watch these types of series all the time.  They dont compare to this set.  This is one to keep and watch on a constant basis.  A MUST BUY for all!!!
B00005JPS8|5.0|This is one of the greatest Marvel movies i have ever seen. Iron Man rivals all of the Spiderman movies barnone. Also with great acting by Robert Downey Jr. (as always) and the beautiful Gweneth Paltrow. The story magnificently tells the story of Iron Man while sending a message about the war in Iraq. Dazzling special effects and action sequences that will blow your mind. i cant wait for the dvd to give to my son. GREAT MOVIE!!!
B000063JDE|4.0|I had never heard of this movie until I was watching a TV show that was describing the 10 best crime movies.  I ordered it new and was pleased with the movie and the prompt delivery from Amazon.
B000FVQM2Y|1.0|THIS IS ONE OF THE WORST MOVIES I HAVE EVER SEEN. IT SEEMS TO HAVE BEEN WRITTEN BY SOME OVERLY COOL HIGH SCHOOL PUNKS. I JUST WANTED TO FAST FORWARD TO THE LAST 5 MINUTES TO SEE WHAT THE MOVIE ENDED UP BEING ABOUT. A FRIEND AND ME ARE GOING TO TAKE IT OUT SKEET SHOOTING OR MAYBE DRAG IT BEHIND THE CAR FOR ABOUT 10 MILES UNTIL IT IS COMPLETELY DESTROYED. IF YOU ARE AN OVERLY COOL ULTRA GEEK, YOU'LL LOVE IT. IF YOU ARE AN ADULT , DON'T BUY IT....HELL, DON'T EVEN RENT IT....PITYFUL
B00004RJEG|5.0|Worth every penny that was spent on this DVD. The Corrs are extremely talented and nothing showcases their talent like a live performance. One of the things I love most about them is that they are not always perfect (Caroline at the end of Runaway) but they are always professional. I loved the song choice they used for this show and I loved all the different instruments and collabrations that were used. They have never sounded better. I tried to pick a favorite song and honestly I couldn't because the whole show is awesome. I loved the show so much I bought the album version of the show as well.
B000VBJEFK|2.0|1080p pic is great, however this movie could not keep my full attention nor my wife and our 3 year old daughter.  I wanted to like this since it was my first blu-ray movie, but I did not.  I resold it the following day.
0743290119|2.0|I was really disappointed in this book. I was looking for a fun summer chick-lit read, and this book didn't live up to my expectations.     Even though some plot-skipping was necessary with three characters' stories to tell, it just skipped around too much. The author spent pages on describing lost luggage during a trip to the Caribbean, yet ended the chapter abruptly when one of the characters met a guy. I wondered if my book was missing some pages!!     Don't waste your money...I doubt there will be a huge queue at your local library if you really want to waste your time.
B0019FOC5E|5.0|This soundtrack is not any worse than the original Mamma mia by ABBA.  I love to hear these actors singing, especially Meryl Streep she's wonderful.  Most of the songs are sung by Meryl and then also Amanda Seyfried, she's got a great voice aswell.  This was such a wonderful movie, and the music is what makes it so entertaining and enjoyable, so I wouldn't hesitate about buying this album.  I'm not disappointed at all except that a couple of the little things the actors added in the movie aren't on the soundtrack (talking or laughing isn't recorded).  Also, \\"Chiquitita\\", \\"I Do, I Do, I Do, I Do, I Do\\", and \\"Waterloo\\" aren't on the soundtrack which is very disappointing.  And everyone says Peirce Brosnan can't sing but I don't agree.  I think he can sing for sure, at least he's on pitch and can land a note.    I  would suggest seeing the movie before buying this album, if you're unsure of how much a fan you are.  It's also better to listen to the music after you've seen the movie cause you can appreciate it more, and imagine the scenes in your head while you listen.  I LOVE THIS MOVIE AND SOUNDTRACK!
B00004ZD69|4.0|Found this at a library being sold for 50 cents. A good buy. It's like some kind of dreamscape to me, only slowed down from dreams' usual chaotivc nature and put under magnifying glass. The music seems to take me on a cosmic journy of sorts, probing through what seems to be the darkness and random memory snippets of a person's mind. it's the sound of your subconcious being drilled into and tossed around by some farming machine whose name escapes me.
B000AP04NI|4.0|I have compared the 2005 50th Anniversary Edition DVD to the 1999 digitally mastered DVD for both video and audio. Visually, the Cinemascope version (Disc 1 of 2) of the 2005 DVD yields the best picture (on wide zoom). Sonically, however, the 1999 DVD sounds better than the 2005 DVD as well as the 2001 remastered audio CD. The sound of the '99 DVD, which had been given THX sound processing, is much more open, bright, and dynamic with clear highs. The sound of the '05 DVD, which really doesn't sound too bad, comes across very slightly muffled, as if it had a layer of gauze placed over it, unfortunately deadening the highs and restricting the openness. So if it's the best picture you're looking for, get the 50th Anniversary DVD. If you want the best sound, get the '99 DVD.
B00168ML1G|5.0|Im amazed you are the first person to say this movie is bad. That this movie has no creativity. Ok, I understand about the movie mocking Afghanistan, I mean you know, from a comic movie, it should be realistic (sarcastic, if you are to dumb to understand). I Read your 1 star review on Incredible Hulk as well, yeah and you say Spider Man 3 was good. Dude Spider Man 3 was the most garbage comic movie I have ever seen, hell all of Spider Man is garbage except for the second, that was decent. So I just think, you have a bad taste in movies. Yeh, you know what is really funny? You never acknowleged the brilliant acting, the brilliant action, and the brilliant story, just Afghanistan. That makes you a bad reviewer too! Next thing you know, you will say Dark Knight was garbage! Dark Knight is in my top 5, if not the best movie I have seen. Iron Man is also in my top 5. Iron Man is one of those few movies that was amazing, it is a must - see, dont listen to Happy Camper, he doesn't have taste for good movies. HE RATES LIONS FOR LAMBS 5 STAR, WHAT AN IDIOT!!!! You make me sick Happy Camper, go away...
B000002MUN|4.0|One of the wonderful things about producer Rick Rubin is that it's been said that he produces by feel. His attitude is not that you play it till you get it right, but you don't play it all unless it feels right. There are stories of Rubin sending bands home if they aren't in the right space while recording. It lends a sort of perspective to his work with Tom Petty for Petty's second 'solo' album, \\"Wildflowers.\\" It's solo in a circumspect manner, as just about all the Heartbreakers drop in for some song or another, and Mike Campbell co-writes a few of the songs here.<br /><br />It's also Petty's most organic and acoustic sounding album short of his 2008 [[ASIN:B0015FHDS6 Mudcrutch]] reunion. From the delicate opening of the title track to the lullaby quality of \\"Wake Up Time,\\" this is Petty at his most laid back. Once or twice, the old Heartbreakers' Rock'n'Roll mojo pops up (\\"You Wreck Me\\" and \\"Honey Bee\\"), but this is even more Dylan or Flying Burrito Brothers than it is Rolling Stones. There's even an uncanny John Lennon feel to \\"Only A Broken Heart.\\"<br /><br />These songs never sound forced or compressed (the way [[ASIN:B000002OH3 Into the Great Wide Open]] sometimes did). Rubin managed to coax little surprises out of Petty, nuances that [[ASIN:B000002O1P Southern Accents]] hinted at but never quite revealed. The album doesn't just feel personal, it sounds personal. It is not too difficult to draw a line through \\"Cabin Down Below,\\" \\"Find a Friend,\\" \\"A Higher Place\\" and \\"House In The Woods\\" to grasp that Petty was in a private place, writing from a core spot in his psyche when \\"Wildflowers\\" was gestating.<br /><br />Perhaps my sole complaint with \\"Wildflowers\\" is that it is so laid back. Where [[ASIN:B000002O5L Full Moon Fever]] let \\"Running Down a Dream\\" rip into high gear, \\"Wildflowers\\" never works up that kind of sweat. At fifteen songs - compared to \\"Fever's\\" dozen or [[ASIN:B000002PCP Damn the Torpedoes']] nine - the relaxed vibe starts getting too sombulent towards the end. Rubin and Petty teamed up again and (in my opinion, at least) better their work on 1999's [[ASIN:B00000IFWE Echo]], and while \\"Wildflowers\\" is one of Tom Petty's most idiosyncratic albums, it falls short of his finest.n and Petty teamed up again and (in my opinion, at least) better their work on 1999's [[ASIN:B00000IFWE Echo]], and while \\"Wildflowers\\" is one of Tom Petty's most idiosyncratic albums, it falls short of his finest.
B0019GO5BO|2.0|We saw this on the shelf at a Target a few weeks back.  Save your money if you already have the collector's edition; this is just the old edition w/a CD of '80s music.
B000WS4PCO|5.0|I first heard this album when it debuted in 1987 and it was my first genuine taste of U2.  I went to their concert that same year and to this day, it was the best concert I have ever seen.  Every single song on this CD is worth listening to again & again.
0767020308|5.0|This is a really difinitive production of Emma.  Aside from the slightly jujeune leading lady (which gets her correctly - even Jane Austen knew she was somewhat dislikable), played excellently by Kate Beckinsale, we have the best Jane Faifax in gorgeous and extemely talented Olivia Williams.  William's Jane is highlighted by some of the prettiest music pieces chosen for Jane - which is part of the character's prowess, and \\"makes\\" her for us as an audience (whether or not she is actually playing it).  And superlatively talented Samantha Morton perfectly cast as the sweet odd-duck.  She is so believably sweet and dim, she is a joy.<br /><br />This version is a bit more wintery and indoor than the version relesed just before it - that one is more summer and green.  But despite some really good performances in the other, this one is so much better on all levels it is silly to compare them.  The Direction here is really good, giving all three of the young heroines some breathing space in their own environment from time to time, which really helps us feel and care for each of them.  And we finally DO care for Emma because she gets a resounding come-uppance.<br /><br />For anyone who thinks Beckinsale's Emma is too dislikable, see the 1970s version - a long, detailed \\"play for tv\\" version in which Emma is extremely cold, disapproving and you just want to slap her... often.  (Still it is an on-target performance and worth seeing.)
0792164903|5.0|The movie Sleepy Hollow (based upon a story by Washington Irving) has an interesting twist in Tim Burtons version. For one thing, Ichabod Crane actually has a<br />well defined happier ending and he gets the girl. The whole movie is done in classic<br />Tim Burton style, shadowy, dark, foggy, and kinda gothic but it works for the film. Christopher Lee offers an excellent performance in a small bit part at the very beginning which really sets the mood somehow for the entire movie. Christina Ricci is<br />all grown up and a fully professional actress and she really shows that also. Johnny<br />Depp though really steals the show between frequent bouts of fainting and getting blood squirted on him from time to time, his facial expressions and acting ability are<br />par excellence. This movie is a must for Christopher Lee, Johnny Depp, or Christina Ricci fans for their collection at home because they all really give some of their<br />best performances in this film. Christopher Walken is good in every movie he stars in so it makes perfect sense he'd be in the best Sleepy Hollow I've ever watched.<br />He plays the perfect headless horseman and Miranda Richardson apart from having<br />a very expressive face and beautiful eyes plays her part exceedingly well also.<br />Halloween can be any time of the year with a Tim Burton flick but we have a tradition at our house of watching Sleepy Hollow or the House on Haunted Hill<br />around Halloween along with numerous other scary movies. I recommend Sleepy Hollow<br />for everyones Halloween traditions and movie collection.
B00005JKNF|5.0|This film can be seen many times and each time, you see something you missed the time before. Both of the commentaries are fascinating. The screenwriter has experienced knowing people who really lived like this, so he is very interesting to listen to. The cast is filled with excellent actors, who, I think, took smaller parts because they wanted to work in a Robert Altman film and they are sublime. No one ever puts a foot wrong. Watch facial expressions and \\"thrown away\\" remarks, that are really vital to the story. I would suggest putting on the \\"caption\\" feature so you can follow the story while listening to the commentaries, or even to be sure you know what the Scottish Mary Maceachran (Maggie Smith's lady's maid) is saying or any other British speech pattern that may be unfamiliar to your ear. Watch for Meg Wynn Owen, who plays Lady Sylvia's lady's maid- she played Hazel Bellamy in the \\"Upstairs, Downstairs\\" series back in the 1970's (a matchless series, in my opinion- don't miss it). Sophie Thompson (Emma's sister) is quietly perfect as Dorothy, the still room maid, who worships Jennings, the butler. She played a perfectly silly woman in \\"Four Weddings and a Funeral\\"- she was the second bride, but she really shows her acting chops in this film. Watch for the \\"strawberry jam\\" scene with Tom Hollander and her speech about the meaning of love, even though your love isn't returned. I couldn't recommend it more. Jeremy Northam plays Ivor Novello (look him up on Google- Jeremy even looks a little like him) in a small part but played beautifully. Altman said he threw in the \\"F\\" word enough times so it would keep 14 year old boys out of the film when it showed in theaters; I don't think it would have been a problem. 14 year old boys wouldn't have been tempted and they wouldn't have understood it- in fact, I doubt if most men would get the point. They would have been looking at their watches hoping it would end soon. People who like the era and all the layers of detail will love it, I am sure. 5 stars from me, though I am a complete and utter Anglophile. You can't go wrong with an Altman film, in any case. It's also a good \\"escape\\" movie- takes you away from one's daily problems for a couple of hours- make some microwave popcorn and some iced tea (or a pot of hot tea!) and kick back. Exquisite!ll love it, I am sure. 5 stars from me, though I am a complete and utter Anglophile. You can't go wrong with an Altman film, in any case.

B00005JPY0|5.0|The Dark Knight is Christopher Nolan's ([[ASIN:B0000640SA Memento]]) follow-up to his first Batman film, [[ASIN:B000PC6A3E Batman Begins]].  The series of films is a frustrating but entirely understandable reset of the [[ASIN:B000B5XOYI not-so old series of films]] started strongly by Tim Burton in 1989 and finished off infamously by Joel Schumacher in 1997.  Nolan has made a dark and real character out of Batman, kind of like writer [[ASIN:1401210791 Frank Miller]] did with Batman in the comic books.<br /><br />The Dark Knight follows Gotham City billionaire Bruce Wayne and his night time vigilante alter-ego Batman (Christian Bale) as a new kind of enemy hits Gotham hard.  The enemy is the demonic and vile Joker (Heath Ledger), a character whose only motive is to concoct schemes to cause massive chaos in every facet of Gotham's society.  Meanwhile, Harvey Dent (Aaron Eckhart) has become Gotham's \\"white knight\\" as a District Attorney in fighting against the forces of organized crime that still persist from the first film.  Dent is dating Wayne's long-time friend Rachel Dawes (Maggie Gyllenhaal).  There are many other elements that I could get into that may lead to some spoilers.<br /><br />It is very important to note that the cast here is very strong.  Bale is great again as Batman and Bruce Wayne.  Eckhart is a pleasant surprise as Dent and shows remarkable depth.  Gyllenhaal is taking over for Katie Holmes in the role of Dawes and she is definitely a more compelling performer.  Michael Caine plays Alfred Pennyworth, Morgan Freeman plays Lucius Fox, and Gary Oldman plays Lieutenant Gordon.  All three actors are without question among the best at their craft and deliver effectively here.  However, it is easy to get overlooked with Heath Ledger playing the Joker and making Jack Nicholson's performance from the 1989 film look like Cesar Romero from the [[ASIN:B00005LOUK old Batman television series]].  Ledger plays him as an authentic and resourceful psychopath.  It reminded me of stories like [[ASIN:B000WQKSJ0 The Killing Joke]] and [[ASIN:0930289560 Arkham Asylum]].  He is the best film villain since [[ASIN:B000PAQI10 Hannibal Lecter]] and if Ledger weren't dead I would be waiting to see what he does next.  That tells me he is deserving of all the hype and will hopefully be recognized.<br /><br />I don't want to play my excitement while seeing this film down one iota; I believe it is to comic book movies what [[ASIN:B000FQJAIW Star Wars]] was to science fiction and what [[ASIN:B000654ZK0 The Lord of the Rings]] was to fantasy adventure, and I sincerely hope it gets the appropriate recognition for this.  I always try to view pulp like this as more than kitsch when it is executed with absolute perfection.  Everything about The Dark Knight delivers so I recommend seeing it twice at your nearest theater but be warned, it is probably too dark for most kids younger than eleven or twelve.of stories like [[ASIN:B000WQKSJ0 The Killing Joke]] and [[ASIN:0930289560 Arkham Asylum]].

I don't want to play my excitement while seeing this film down one iota; I believe it is to comic book movies what [[ASIN:B000FQJAIW Star Wars]] was to science fiction and what [[ASIN:B000654ZK0 The Lord of the Rings]] was to fantasy adventure, and I sincerely hope it gets the appropriate recognition for this.  I always try to view pulp like this as more than kitsch when it is executed with absolute perfection.  Everything about The Dark Knight delivers so I recommend seeing it twice at your nearest theater but be warned, it is probably too dark for most kids younger than eleven or twelve.
B0006399FS|5.0|I am having a hard time understanding all of these one-star reviews.  This is a solid album from a great band, and is by no means the kind of \\"muzak\\" that other reviewers have referred to it as.  I don't understand why having a distinctive sound and choosing to write songs that show it somehow amounts to a tired rehashing of old ideas.  I thought that part of being a good band was developing a distinctive sound.  It's not their fault that countless other bands have borrowed chiming guitars and soaring vocals.  This isn't a five star album, more like 4, but I rated it to try to offset the countless, and to my mind inexplicable, one star reviews.  The most disappointing thing about this album is that so many people on this page have written it off, most often with no real reason whatsoever.  Not the Joshua Tree or Achtung Baby, but definitely worth a listen and far superior to most of what is out there today.
B001B71NOI|4.0|The album starts with \\"999,999\\", which sounds like a lead in from \\"Ghosts I-IV\\", and then kicks into \\"1,000,000\\" and then it's full steam ahead.<br /><br />Bascially, NIN seems to have slipped into \\"Party Mode\\", and recorded a lot of slam-bang, kickass, rock the house songs. While obviously this might disappoint the music pundits or the hardcore NIN fanbase, the album is great to listen to. Unlike their last rock out album, \\"With Teeth\\", this feels like a \\"slimmed down\\",no frills edition. Even with the \\"Ghosts\\" feel of tracks 7-9 there isn't a letdown song on this album.<br /><br />Highly recommended.<br /><br />On the Limited Edition, the extra DVD has five B/W live session music videos of the album highlights, in particular \\"1,000,000\\", \\"Discipline\\" and \\"Letting You\\". (It's a bit jarring seeing Trent make like, and even look like Henry Rollins, but hey, sue me, I've been a fan of both since the 80's. :P )

It is amazing how the writers have used the words of the famous ABBA songs and turned them into the plot and almost the complete story of \\"Mamma Mia!\\"  Or did they change some of the words to fit the story?

Streep sings, dances, bounces on a bed, and even caulks with a caulking gun--does it all, and well.  A second trio of young girls led by Sophie (Amanda Seyfried), try to out-shine the older trio in performing ABBA songs written likely prior to their birth.  They leave the male viewers drooling in their popcorn.  Yes, the male stars get their own chance with dancing and music.  Regardless of who is the star performer for any given number, you listen and have to sing along, dance, laugh, or at least chuckle while toe tapping.<br /><br />Star four represents the line dancing, chorus-line, or long pier choreography done first by a large ladies group and later another tune by men pier-dancing in flippers.

0525950079|4.0|This book made a great summer read!  I found myself picking it up every chance I got because I couldn't wait to find out what would happen next.  There are many stories and characters (100's) intricately woven together.  I imagine that if soap operas had existed in the middle ages, the storylines would have been similar.  However, if you are looking for deep reading, World is not it.  Despite the book's long length, this is very light, easy reading. For me, the most interesting parts of the book were the ones dealing with the plague and how it changed medieval society.  One thing that sets this book apart from other historical novels I've read is that it deals with everyday people rather than royalty and the nobility. The main characters are Merthin and Ralph, brothers whose father is a former knight now reduced to poverty, Gwenda, a girl born into utter poverty who manages to survive anyway, and Caris, the daughter of a wealthy merchant.      Many readers have criticized the amount of \\"gratuitous\\" sex in the book.  There are, at times, a good bit, but no more than one finds on T.V. these days.  Also, I would hardly call the sex scenes explicit, but so badly written that they are almost comical.  They seem to have been written from a adolescent male's point of view.  Many other criticisms were from people who did not even finish the book.  I don't think it is fair to write a crtical review of a book you did not bother to finish.  If they had hung in there, they would have found that there as an explanation for everything that happened.    While I enjoyed this book a great deal, I gave it 4 stars because I felt that it was poorly edited.  There was too much repetition in the book.  For example, Philemon and Godwyn were described as being \\"obsequious\\" at least ten times making me wonder why someone didn't pick up a thesaurus.  One also gets tired of reading about how plump Madge Webber is, that Gwenda looks like a rodent and other repititious physical descriptions ofthe many characters.    One other complaint I have is that the Catholic Church is portrayed as being corrupt. While there was quite a bit of corruption in the church at that time, they were not all bad and I wish there had been a few pious church leaders portrayed in the book to balance out the bad leaders.      If you are looking for a light read that will keep you hooked I think you will enjoy this book.  I hope Mr. Follett will write another sequel.  I would love to find out how Kingsbridge Priory survives Henry VIII and the Protestant Reformation.

0316143472|4.0|Almost every book I've read by David Sedaris has elicited body-shaking and rather loud laughter.  His latest, \\"When You Are Engulfed in Flames,\\" is no exception.  Those familiar with Sedaris' literary voice won't skip a beat; it's almost as if the time between this and his last book was a break in a conversation.<br /><br />David Sedaris is a talented comedy writer.  Oftentimes the back cover of his books has compared him to Mark Twain and Nathaniel West in terms of satirical aptitude.  \\"When You Are Engulfed in Flames\\" does well to promote this idea.

B00139W3NE|1.0|Once upon a time, there was a show called Mystery Science Theater 3000. The premise of this show was to take bad movies from bygone days and riff snarky comedy off of them.    Watching MST3k (as it was known by its fans, the MSTies), I was always led to wonder about the original films. For most of them, presumably, there was a day when the movie was taken kind of seriously. I mean, maybe not Manos, but some of those others -- they had writers, directors, and actors who wanted to produce a decent, money-making product (not to mention the investors/producers!). I also bet that a number of the movies spoofed by Joel, Mike & the bots had fans at one point. That they were not complete flops at the theater, or in the minds of the theater-goers.    In many respects, cinema has changed from then to now. Budgets are up all-around, and standards have changed so that we're not likely to see the zippers on monsters anymore. But, as the expression goes, the more things change, the more they stay the same. Bad writing is still bad writing. Zippers on costumes have been replaced with bad CG effects. And high-budget schlock is arguably worse than the low-budget variety. I expect that 30 years from now, we'll again be able to support an MST3k-type venture. If so, certainly there are movies from our age that they could slam with justice.    I submit to you that The Golden Compass is one of those movies.    Reading Philip Pullman's novel was a decent experience. I enjoyed it. After having read the following two novels in his trilogy, I eventually decided that (sadly) Pullman doesn't really know what he was doing, and that The Golden Compass was more the exception than the rule.    Watching this film, where all of the main plot events are presented at a break-neck, frenetic pace, it made me feel foolish for ever having liked the first novel to begin with. The characters are cardboard (what acting talent went to waste, here!), the plot events are unbelievable (even given the grand latitude I cut children's fantasy), and whatever thematic material there is, is convoluted and obscure.    This isn't a good movie. It stuffs a mess of exposition into an opening voice over then runs from event to event without time to enjoy anything. I remember in reading the novel that there was some time at the beginning to get to know Lyra before she set out with Mrs. Coulter; here, it happens in the space of about 15 minutes. Seeing the characters come to life points out their basic absurdity, like Lee Scorsby who I could take somewhat seriously in the novel, but not at all here -- he becomes a Texan caricature. Even with its CG world and creatures, this movie never achieves the sense of wonder of, say, a Neverending Story; it has no time for a sense of wonder, and Iorek and Serafina Pekkala are cold substitutes for the likes of Falkor.    At the least, the movie tries to address some of the shortcomings of Pullman's book, in reorganizing the final events to end on the main plot's climax, and small things like making Lyra's the only extant alethiometer. But those (good) changes can't overcome the central weaknesses of the story which are only heightened by seeing it try to come to life on the screen.    His Dark Materials is often compared (grossly unfairly) with The Lord of the Rings. They are similar, however, in that I'd imagine it would be hard to make either into good films, given the amount of action and detail in them. The Lord of the Rings was given the running time and the care to pull it off in glorious fashion. The Golden Compass, however much money was put into it, was a failure. It disappoints its source material which, in the final analysis, was never all that great. The only good thing to really come out of this film is that, it did so poorly both financially and critically, that the sequels will almost certainly not get made.    Another good can be made from this film: fodder for a future version of Mystery Science Theater 3000. What do you think, sirs?
B000WGWQG8|5.0|This well done adaptation of David McCullough's biography of the same title leaves out a few scenes that would have lent a bit more insight into the early years of our republic. However the verisimiltude is outstanding, right down to bad teeth in old age for people living in that time.

0375805613|5.0|I have forgotten all about this book until someone mentioned it in a bookclub that I belong to. She reads it to her son every night. And I remember how much fun I had reading it to my nephew 13 years ago on vacation, so I scurried online and ordered a copy of it. My sons (even though they are probably too old for it) request it every night since it arrived. They think it is a hoot and a hollar. And they beg me to keep turning the pages (I must be raising some fearless boys!) and when they get to the end, they giggle with glee.<br /><br />My advice is, don't wait to buy this book. Get it now and enjoy some reading time with your children. This book is just absolutely fun and I know that it will keep my sons interested in reading.

His mother, Lyla is told that her baby has died. His father, Louis was unaware that there ever was a child. Louis and Lyla long for each other.

He goes home with a street musician about his age, who plays for donations. Evan finds himself in a run down theatre, living with many other runaways. The leader, a man called the Wizard, discovers Evans talents, and gives him the choice spot as a street performer. He also names him August Rush, which sounds more like a performer's name.<br /><br />August Rush follows the music he hears and walks into a church with a choir practicing. Evan can play the piano on his first try. His music leads him to perform his own symphany, in Central Park. August Rush is sure that if his music can be presented to a larger audience he will find his parents.<br /><br />This is a sweet and happy film. The music is delightful. You will find yourself anxiously hoping for Evan to find his parents.

1582701709|3.0|The title sums it all. 'The Secret' is revealed in the first few pages of the book and the rest of the book just elaborates on 'The Secret'.    You become what you think so think positively, act positively, entertain positive emotions and curtail negative ones. If you want to live happily, think about being happy, if you want wealth think about it, if you want good health think about being healthy and the list goes on and on....The placebo effect is given utmost importance.     If a storm or a natural calamity kills masses, it's because of their thinking which happened to be negative in some capacity, totally unknown to them - Give me a break!    Abundance is the way to go. The book advocates 'Giving' but undermines 'Sacrifice'. Because, 'Giving' indicates prosperity and abundance and 'Sacrifice' indicates poverty. A tremendous let down to conventional religious patrons.     The book might be helpful if you are in deep distress but fails to impress any sane rational thinker. The author tries to substantiate her holistic approach through some quantum mechanics etc but doesn't do a good a job. If you become what you think and you think positive about yourself and 10 others think negatively about yourself. What happens then? What if 100 or 1000 think negatively about yourself. Are the effects totally and utterly negated against you? If you don't want to think much and just want some 'feel good' philosophy, then this book is for you and you will probably enjoy it.

B000Q8QHK8|4.0|I don't have the greatest home theatre setup for judging a Blu-Ray professionally but I can say that in my humble opinion there was little wrong with the image or audio quality here. Colors were strong, image was sharp, alternate-format scenes (8mm, 16mm, video) all looked about as best as they should. There are plenty of entertaining supplements, including the \\"director's cut ending\\" (which is inferior) and I can say that I don't really miss the stuff Oliver Stone had to take out for this theatrical cut (4 minutes). Most of it is still in the deleted scenes.    If you're a completest then perhaps this edition isn't for you, but if you're just a fan of the film, get this Blu-Ray. About a minute of extended shots of violence does not a film make. I don't think it's really worth waiting indefinitely for the \\"Director's Cut\\".    Film: A-  Video: B+  Sound: (Tough call. I don't have surround.)
0618918248|4.0|Richard Dawkins rationally analyzes why there is no god from every possible angle, and why religion hurts societies.  Much of the book is like a debate that takes the token responses of theists and then a long and thorough rebuttal from Richard Dawkins.  I already knew a lot of the arguments Dawkins goes over just by thinking about it on my own, which many are quite obvious yet need to be stated.  The part of the book I found most interesting was how religion hurts societies, which no one really talks about.  The arguments Dawkins bring up are very complete and if you're an atheist looking for some added tools in your arsenal of argumentation, this book is perfect for that too.  All in all, the book is pretty long, somewhat dry at parts, and is not a quick read either.  If you are open-minded and/or interested in the subject I would suggest this book.  I don't think the book is going have the intended effect of converting many people to atheism, because believing in god involves preconceived faith not rational thinking imho, but is likely to make more atheists come out of the closet (for lack of a better metaphor) because of the comfort this book will bring to atheists.

I was rather unimpressed and frankly don't understand all the hype this book has generated.  The writing style was not particularly riveting either, probably because it was translated from Portuguese into a basic form of English so some of the meaning may have been lost.  The story is inspiring, positive and has a good message overall, but so do so many other books that are better written...

The movie is about an adolescent kid who is stuck in a dream he keeps waking up from and navigates his way talking to various people each with deep philosophical outlooks on life.

B0013J30W2|4.0|I'm about as jaded as the next person, so i went into this expecting to hate it.  Cliched action scenes?  Check.  Over-use of cgi?  Check.  Ridiculous lapses of logic or sense?  Check.  Shaky-camera close-ups(a personal annoyance)?  Check.<br /><br />But wait...what's this?  Did i care for the lead character and root for him?  Check.  Was i kept entertained throughout most of the film?  Check.  Was Angelina Jolie's character kept in line to allow the movie to focus on our protaganist?  Check.<br /><br />Honestly, i didn't know much about this film(or its origins) except for its generic trailer that featured that idiotic scene where A.J. 'picks up' McAvoy's character in that car.  I thought that headache-inducing scene in the actual movie was terrible too(see my complaint about shaky-camera close-ups).  But here's the thing, i was eventually won over by James Mcavoy and his performance and once i put my \\"that can't possibly happen\\" mentality behind, i thouroughly enjoyed the film believe it or not.  (and it's not that easy for me, as on a related note, i tried to put that mentality behind for Indiana Jones 4 and still couldn't enjoy it that much.)<br /><br />Here's the test for WANTED though.  Early in the film, if you can't accept the scene where an assassin jumps from one building to another building and think to yourself \\"ok, so this isn't a standard assassins movie\\" then you might as well ask for a refund or stop the dvd right then and there.  But if you can accept the premise of these superhero-esque assassins with special powers and allow yourself to go along with the main character, then you might actually enjoy the film.  I know i'm surprised i did.  And if the dvd has tons of extras, i might be convinced to buy it.  Overall, 3 1/2 stars(rounded up to 4 on amazon) because the lead actor(not the action scenes, cgi, or camera-work) propels this film to rise above average mediocrity.  And in this day and age, for me, that's a rarity.
B0001WGDX0|3.0|These Bernstein/WPO performances and DG recordings are good of course, how could they be bad. Even so, this symphonic cycle doens't make it into the top ten of Beethoven's symphonies and it should certainly not be anyone's first or only choice.   Fans of Bernstein will probably give it five ***** stars before or even without a hearing and it is a very attractively priced for which I'm  grateful.  Personnaly, I prefer a conductor who tries to the best of his ability to play the composer's music and less the conductor's interpretation of the same.  Still, Beethoven has broad shoulders and there is place on them for many a conductor with their own views. We are happily spoilt for choice.

Looking only at the plot, this is a pretty standard origin film:  billionaire industrialist Tony Stark (Robert Downey Jr., phenomenal) is a famous playboy (think Bruce Wayne if Wayne was actually enjoying himself) who is caught by the enemy in wartime Afghanistan (the modern version of his origin detailed by Warren Ellis, updated from the original Vietnam), and builds a suit of powered armour to escape captivity.  He arrives home a changed man, vowing to take on the military-industrial complex at home while protecting the innocent abroad.  This doesn't go over especially well with his board of directors, including his father's old partner Obadiah Stane (Jeff Bridges, bald).  Meanwhile, Tony's girl friday, Pepper Potts (Gwenyth Paltrow, returning to the screen after an absenceof a few years), and his best friend General James Rhodes (Terrence Howard) worry about what he's up to.    The film is a hodgepodge of different areas of the comics, distilled: the basic origin and Pepper Potts' presence are from the original Stan Lee/Don Heck era, though otherwise this is strongly influenced by the Layton/Michelinie period, particularly the presence of James Rhodes as the lead male supporting character, and Tony's immediate motivation for becoming a superhero, which is modelled heavily on \\"Armour Wars\\".  Obadiah Stane, repurposed from the O'Neill era, is the main villain.    As earlier stated, it's a basic origin film, but it's the execution and the details that elevate it to the level of excellence.  Downey Jr. is indispensable as Tony Stark, created one of the most likeable characters yet seen in a superhero film; relentlessly charismatic and amusing in a way that strongly recalls Johnny Depp's Captain Jack Sparrow.  Bridges, as Stane, does a strong job as Tony's corporate foe, although he isn't an especially big part of the story; indeed, probably the best stuff in the movie are the scenes when it is just Downey Jr. and some robotic props developing the armour.  There's a spectacular setpiece battle when Iron Man first takes the fight to terrorists in Afghanistan, and later returns to rescue a village, concluding with a dogfight with the US Air Force.    Mild criticism might be that the final defeat of the Iron Monger is vague and not especially climactic, but it suits the purpose well enough.    The film is peppered with setup for future Marvel projects: SHIELD (and, if you stay after the credits, ol' Nick himself, talking about his \\"Avenger Initiative\\"), an expansive terrorist network referred to as the \\"Ten Rings\\" (of the Mandarin), and, my favourite, Rhodey vowing \\"next time, baby\\" on seeing a silver-grey suit of Iron Man armour.    Highly recommended.
B0014WSWTY|5.0|Here is a Beethoven symphony cycle (again) on period instruments (again). So why should it stick out in the midst of dozens of other cycles ? Yet it does stick out.   These symphonies by Jos Van Immerseel and his small-scale orchestra Anima Eterna are all fresh, full of tintillating life. In fact, the orchestra is perfectly modelled on the size of the symphony orchestra in Beethoven's time, everything has been done in an effort to recreate the sound that Beethoven sought to create and that he would have heard (or wish to hear)himself. The details about the research and the production are explained in a well-written multilingual booklet included in the box.   The sounds. These symphonies are a wealth of sounds, I have never before heard the percussion so clearly and the same goes for practically every individual instrument and yet the music flows and sings with all instruments together, dynamically and harmoniously : this is pure heaven.  I'm very fond of Beethoven's symphonies and I have some two dozen complete cycles in my collection but this one goes straight to the top as one of the very, very best.
B000L212HC|5.0|I read quite a few other reviews, and from what I could gather is the people that had a problem with this movie are those who do not like to think at a  movie and let the movie do the thinking for them.  Don't get me wrong, that is all well and good.  A lot of people either like this movie or The Illusionist better, and, no offense to these people, are not deep thinking people, at least to the ones that I know.  (And most of them admit to being so).  This movie is a great mystery movie, and I recommend it to anybody who likes mystery movies.    When I first saw this movie in the theater I did not feel lost at all, but felt more enlightened to the story as it went by.  The movie has good twists all the way through it, and the overall theme is great: obsession will eventually consume you.
B000000OQY|4.0|Guns N' Roses-Lies ****<br /><br />Lies was the highly, highly anticipated follow up to [[ASIN:B000008GAC Appetite for Destruction]], the bands massively successful and not to mention classic debut album. Upon first listen you might not even realize it it is the same band who recorded that amazing debut; but while this might not be the groups strongest effort it remains their most ambitious and ultimate statement. Rose's vocals are stronger here than at any other time, and Slash/Izzy's guitar attack though sometimes acoustic looses no power creating a sound so unforgettable its ridiculous.<br /><br />The first side of the album; the electric side. This is less than stellar to say the least. 'Reckless Life' is among the groups best rockers, while 'Nice Boys' is a nice idea but comes across as a parody of their debut. That seems to be the trend with the rest of the first side of the album. 'Move To The City is really a take it or leave it, and the cover of the Aerosmith classic 'Mama Kin' is nice but should have been much better.<br /><br />'Patience' kicks off side two with a bang. While side two is almost entirely acoustic it rocks harder and better than the first side. 'Used To Love Her' and the remake of 'Your Crazy' are Axl at his most angry, other then the closer that is. 'One In A Million' is the most racist and homophobic songs in the groups canon and it is the bands boldest statement and greatest achievement over all. The track is genius and was the bands final statement before going arena rock.<br /><br />While not as good as the debut it surpasses the Illusions albums hands down. Lies is one album that has to be heard. Many claim to have never listened to it and yet somehow have an opinion, It doesn't work that way. Not with Lies at least. Check it out it is worth it.
B00005JPY0|5.0|I must say I really enjoyed this movie.  Heath Ledger's portrayal of the Joker is everything you've heard it is, and more -- his passing was a great loss.  BUT, having said this, Batman is, and will always be, Adam West.  Commissioner Gordon will always be Neil Hamilton, Alfred, Alan Napier, and of course the Joker -- Cesar Romero.  I don't say this in jest, but very seriously.  The \\"real\\" Batman was pure, funloving camp -- that was the whole idea!  Ever since Michael Keaton donned the cowl back in 1989, there's been this whole \\"darkness\\" associated with the franchise, never more so than in \\"The Dark Knight\\".  This is no more Batman than the Tom Cruise \\"Mission Impossibles\\" were \\"Mission Impossible\\".  Fun movies? Yes.  But the real thing? ----- Holy Misguided Imitations, Batman!!
0307165485|5.0|This is a wonderful treasury of stories and pictures designed to keep young children amused and entertained. Gentle lessons in how to be polite and be a good member of a household are delivered with humor, questions to the reader, and brightly colored illustrations.<br /><br />I used to read this book to my sister when she was very young for hours on end. My 2 1/2 year old son discovered it in our bedroom a few months ago, and now it has become, in his words, our special book, and we read from it night and day!

B001AW9DKK|5.0|So Neil Young has no right to be critical of US policy unless he's a US citizen?  So by extension that means I have no right to be critical of the Chinese government for genocide in Tibet if I'm not a Chinese citizen?      And since the US somehow first fought for the right to free speech (there have been many before us), you have to be American to have permission to use it?  Dude, your logic impairment and ignorance of history is a symptom of getting all your information through your friendly corporate war machine sponsored television.  Please back away from the TV, turn it off, and start reading history and current events from non-corporate and government sources.  But be brave - because you're about to learn that everything you think you know is wrong (we've all been there).      Neil Young deserves major props for being courageously ahead of the curve with his anti-war message.  By contrast CSN largely acclaimed for their their strong antiwar message in the 60's went MIA in the dark years of the Iraq war.  What were they up to?  Milking the geriatric nostalgia tour gravy train, reliving their youths and vainly bragging about all the drugs they took and women they had in the 60's.  Sorry but being late to the bandwagon earns you exactly negative street cred points.    On the plus side, they do try to make amends with urgent and emotive performances.  So my advice is to not think about CSN as fair weather peaceniks, but look at them as excellent session performers backing up a truly gifted and courageous artist and human being - Neil Young.  Oh yeah, and enjoy the music!
0394800389|5.0|Even though this book doesn't leave a meaningful message like many other Seuss books (Horton Hears a Who, How The Grinch Stole Christmas, Yertle the Turtle, etc), it's still loads of fun to read. I bought this for my son when he was still a baby, and for a couple of years he didn't understand it and wasn't interested. Now that he's 3y.o. and into imaginative play, he loves it when we read the creative tongue-twisters of Fox in Socks, and tries to read along though it's still a bit difficult for him (some of the rhymes are difficult for me too if I read them quick!). Like all Seuss books, the rhymes, characters and silly stories are very creative and an incentive for children and adults to play with the imagination.

B000W99IMK|2.0|I think he would have been better off staying with System of a down! I looove that band and now they broke up and made their own albums. Both Serj and Scars on Broadway are pretty terrible albums. Download one or two good songs, don't buy the whole album.
B00005JPY0|4.0|The newest installment of the Batman franchise makes good its promises of 'darkness'.  Though I didn't find the imagery of this movie as drab overall as say in the first movie, the story line certainly does set the mood.<br /><br />Once again, outstanding performance by the leads in this movie.  I can't imagine why anyone other than Christian Bale has ever played Batman.<br /><br />And, yes, Heath Ledger was eerily fantastic.<br /><br />I can't add too much in the way of original thought here as I've been too overexposed to other opinions, but the following is my two-cents worth.<br /><br />While I overall enjoyed the movie, I walked away with these thoughts (hence the 4-star rating which averaged between 3- and 5-star elements of the movie):<br /><br />Pros:<br />1) Christian Bale.  Great actor and easy on the eyes.<br />2) Cool gadgets.<br />3) Crazy stunts.<br />4) Gross but cool magic scene involving pencil.<br /><br />Cons:<br />1) I was ready to leave when we first see Two-face (thought it was a set up for the next movie...wrong) --2.5hr movie felt like 5 hours and 3 movies rolled into one.  I felt the same way about Spiderman 3.  What is with comic film producers that they want to cram as much in as possible?<br />2)Get off the soap box--There must have been a min. number of monologues provision for the actors.  I was growing weary of hearing the tedious (and often cliched) explanations for insanity and doing what's right and doing what one thinks is right though is insane to others.  I didn't need the Joker talking so overtly about chaos and all that.  His character demonstrates it just fine.  And if the audience was paying attention then they caught the two different stories of how he got his scars...a classic tell-tale sign of a compulsive liar and sociopath.<br /><br />Overall an entertaining flick, but doesn't hold up to its predecessor which, IMHO, is hands down the best of all the Batman films thus far.

B0013FSL3E|5.0|Wall*E is a wonderful film. It is entertaining, and also sheds light on the possible future. Wall*E is able to continue to evolve culturally due to the artifacts (Hello Dolly video) left behind by humans eight hundred years before the earth became uninhabitable. Wall*E is an endearing and likeable character, as is Eve.     Wall*E collects artifacts and learns to be, well, human, perhaps more human than the actual species who takes the name.    Wall*E is also about the history of culture, particularly art.  If you walk out during the credits you will have missed one of Wall*E's most important messages.       Wall*E the film asks some interesting questions:  What is the essence of the human species: our culture?   What remains, when all is said and done?    Following the film Wall*E, What remains is culture. What we leave behind may be film, works of literature, music, ideas.     Wall*E may indeed be one of those works of humanity that last another eight hundred years.
0312323867|5.0|I read this book with low expectations.  I had read Baby Proof by Emily Griffin and found it to be somewhat average.  I read this only because the reviews were so high.  (and I haven't read Something Borrowed Yet).    It is a wonderful, touching story about an initially, selfish, superficial woman who worries too much abou having the best, being the best, the most loved, most wanted etc.    She has an affair with her fiancee's friend really to prove that he wants her more than her friend or anyone else.  She ends of pregnant.  Her wedding is called off and she finds her best friend (RACHEL) is part of the reason for it being called off.    Bitterness overcomes her she finds herself alone, shamed etc.  Not knowing what to do, she goes to London to be with an childhood friend, Ethan, to get away from it all.  In part to make people worry, in part to make her Rachel jealous of her being with their mutual childhood friend, Ethan.    As time goes on Darcy, you can see Darcy changing.  Analyzing what's important, what matters and what really doesn't matter.  It's a story about true love and how a single person can change everything and how you look at the world.  It's a story about friendship, letting go of the past, and forgiveness.  Darcy changes a lot up until her delivery and of course, changes even after that.    A really believable, well written tale that warms your heart.  I listened to the audio version (unabridged) and it was fabulous.   The narrator does an exquisite job of capturing Darcy and you can really hear the subtle changes in her and the book progresses....Delightful.    I can't wait to read Something Borrowed, which unfortunetatly, does not come in audio....but can't wait to find out the back story.....I would definetly recommend this book.  A lovely story.
B0012M4OUW|4.0|I received my Zippo Blu on July 7, 2008.  I filled it with Zippo butane fuel and it lit on the first strike but that was first and the last time it lit on the first strike. It was so hard to light that I had to carry a Bic and the Zippo Blu was basically useless. I went to Zippo's web site and sent them a note about it via their \\"Contact Us\\" link. I did not receive an email reply but exactly one week later I received an envelope in the mail from Zippo. It contained a replacement flint wheel cartridge for my Zippo Blu. I replaced the original flint wheel cartridge with the new one and now it works great. Lighting almost every time on the first strike. I guess they knew from my description what was wrong and without further ado they fixed it without my having to send it in for repair. It's too bad that it originally had a manufacturing flaw but the service was great and they lived up to their promise that, \\"No one ever spent a cent to repair a Zippo\\".
0307455378|5.0|This is quite possibly one of the best books I have EVER read. Very well written, and very moving with every scene that attempted to invoke it. His style is fantastic, and this book made Zafón one of my favorite authors of all time, adding so much flavor to our current literary scene. Don't get me wrong, I loved La Sombra del Viento also. This one was incredible to say the least. Someone else mentioned on here that this is a sequel. This is actually a PREQUEL to La Sombra del Viento, as according to the Epilogue, Daniel Sempere is born, and someone important to him dies a little later (I won't spoil it).
0156030209|3.0|i thoroghly enjoyed reading this book.  the imagination and execution of the the author's writing style is of high quality.  the cadence and movement of the plot was impeccable.      my criticism, however, is in the implicit theme in the conclusion of the book that implies that epic stories and myths that come from the long lost past (and are often found in religion), if they can't be proven, must therefore not have happened.  the lost city of troy was for so long considered to be a complete myth.  well, we now know it existed. and almost exactly as it was described in the illiad! moreover, if we didn't have the actual specimens here to show/befuddle us, we wouldn't believe that the ancient pyramids could possibly have been constructed with an engineering ability far greater than our technologically enabled one.    i agree that great meaning, both individually and collectively as a society, can come from ancient myths that have been passed down from the centuries.  however, i think it is a true mistake, and a symptom of ignorance and arrogance, to discredit the possibility of events occurring in human kind's distant past that seem very implausable and remote to us in this day and age.  many of the events that took place in the seminal times of the great religions quite possibly did indeed occur and weren't simply the results of a creative scribes imagination.  quite honestly, much stranger things than a tiger and boy sharing a raft at sea for a year have probably happened during the course of history.
B000001C6M|5.0|I picked this album up just to add it to my slayer collection actually. But i was blown back by it. I dont care that it's kinda cheesy and the production sucks a bit, this is probably my favorite slayer album. Its just good fun, pure thrash metal. It also has my personal favorite slayer song tormentor. The song just gives me chills everytime i hear it. Other great songs are evil has no boundaries(doesnt slayer just have a knack for making kickass openers?), the antichrist, die by the sword, and black magic.
0316010669|3.0|Like the reviewer who posted just before me, I also thought the book could have made an excellent article. You can certainly skip around in this book and get the point of it. I forced myself to read the whole book even though I lost interest maybe halfway or 2/3 of the way through because the author seemed to be just supporting his main idea with more and more examples. I thought I should force myself to read the whole book in case I missed some amazing new insights, but there was nothing new in it. I enjoyed the examples though, which is why I give this book 3 stars. All in all it was truly mediocre at best.

B00000K44W|4.0|Jethro Tull's folk album, and I like it. It's a lot less serious than some of Tull's other, admittedly hit-or-miss late '70s albums, and that's a lot of what makes it so enjoyable, along with the fact that the tunes are good. The Celtic folk-influenced \\"Acres Wild\\" is one of my favorite Tull tunes. It's really distinct, somewhere between a jig and rock, and it's a lot of fun too. Even folksier is the gorgeous \\"Moths,\\" with Ian playing a first-rate flute part, and \\"One Brown Mouse,\\" with a small army of acoustic guitars. Meanwhile, the pro-agrarian title track alternates between pastoral English folk and extremely heavy, thundering rock, making it one of the group's very best, most imaginative extended works. It even has a violin solo! \\"The Mouse Police Never Sleeps\\" and \\"Weathercock\\" are also enjoyable folk songs, though both of them have rather childish, unimpressive lyrics. The only problem is when Anderson lets his obsession with fitting as many ideas as possible into one song carry him away. \\"No Lullaby,\\" \\"Journeyman\\" and \\"The Rover\\" all shun melody in favor of complexity, and I don't like that. I can at least tolerate \\"No Lullaby,\\" other than the overly busy drumming, but \\"Journeyman\\" and \\"The Rover\\" just leave me cold. So just ignore both of those, and you've got a near-classic on your hands, by far the last great Tull album.
B0017I1FP8|5.0|This is a truly awe inspiring soundtrack. I thought the first one was great, but they manage to top it with Dark Knight, and they do it with flying colors. Hans Zimmer, ever the epic composer, and James Newton Howard are a fantastic team up for such a deep and eerily dark film score. By itself, the soundtrack makes for an interesting and fairly good listening experience, and I say that having heard to soundtrack before I saw the movie. But once you see the movie, I think you gain a much greater appreciation for how well done each track is.<br /><br />Just as a score is supposed to do, it adds to the experience of the movie; contributing to the emotions and reactions you have while you watch what happens on screen. This soundtrack however, is not only adding to the experience, it is ESSENTIAL to the movie. As amazing as the film is, I doubt it would be received the same way without the music behind it. Bottom line, this is a must for all movie score lovers and especially fans of Hans Zimmer and/or James Newton Howard. This is definitely among their best work.  Easily 5/5 stars!
B000AXWV40|5.0|I don't know what drugs Clinton and co. were on when they recorded this classic. I probably don't want to. The first two were pretty weird as well, but this one makes 'em look tame. Here, you get a lot of the acid funk-rock stuff the group was doing in their early days, only what they did was took that formula and improved on it. The winding, stoned jams that took up most of the first record are better, so are the loud, crazy freakouts that took up much of the second one. And the short tracks rule as usual.<br />First up, there's \\"Maggot Brain,\\" with Eddie Hazel playing a guitar solo worthy of Hendrix. It's amazing how much emotion he pulls out of it, and the huge variety of feelings he expresses just with is guitar. It's wonderful stuff, but part of me thinks I like the bonus full band mix more, just because you get a cool marimba part with that one. Either way, it's one of the top five (if not top three) tunes that ever came out of the P-Funk camp. \\"Can You Get to That?\\" rules, too. It's totally different from the emotional odyssey that was \\"Maggot Brain\\" - it's a down-home folk song with a great melody and awesome baritone vocals, and  it actually manages to almost be as good as \\"Maggot Brain.\\" Not quite, but close. Then you get a couple sweet acid-soul songs, with Bernie showing off his weird organ stuff: \\"Hit it and Quit it\\" and \\"You and Your Folks, Me and My Folks.\\" Totally cool tunes, both of 'em. Then it's back to the rock, with the uber-heavy \\"Super Stupid,\\" with another one of Eddie's Hendrixian solos. It's yet another highlight - everyone gets a chance to rock out, and they don't waste it. I'm a bit disappointed by \\"Back in Our Minds,\\" though. It's okay, but isn't particularly interesting. It's made up for by \\"Wars of Armageddon,\\" though. That's the best freakout ever to come from Funkadelic. A ten minute celebration of all things sex, drugs, and rock 'n' roll. Most people don't like it, but I think it's quite cool.<br />Bonus tracks! You've got the alternate mix of \\"Maggot Brain,\\" \\"I Miss My Baby\\" (cool song!), and \\"Singing a New Song\\" (eh.) Worth a purchase! I don't know what to call this one. It rocks harder than most \\"funk\\" albums, and has more groove and bottom than most \\"rock\\" albums. Funkadelic was always cool, but the early stuff is insanely creative.of \\"Maggot Brain,\\" \\"I Miss My Baby\\" (cool song!), and \\"Singing a New Song\\" (eh.) Worth a purchase!

Once the song ended and 30 seconds had passed the track kept playing in the car's CD Player. A minute and 12 seconds later there is a surprise. There's a secret track after \\"All I Want Is You\\".

B000RPTQ1C|5.0|I've been a Coldplay fan since the beginning--when \\"Yellow\\" broke in the US and \\"Parachutes\\" was released in 2000. While I fell in love with the music, I never liked the production on \\"Parachutes\\" and \\"A Rush of Blood to the Head\\".  It wasn't until the live album in 2003 that people got to hear what a full sound they have and how hard they rock live!  While \\"X & Y\\" was recorded better, and has a lot of really good songs, to me it doesn't have a good, overall feel to it.     Then along came \\"Viva la Vida.\\"  Oh my gosh.  I can't even express how much I love this album.  From the beginning with the almost instrumental \\"Life in Technicolor\\" to the rousing ending of \\"Death and All His Friends\\", the soft moments in between like \\"Chinese Sleep Chant\\", Chris doing more with his low octave, so many great songs!  Sure, Brian Eno added his ethereal Eno thing to it, but I feel he just provided a beautiful showcase for a brillant record.  It's definitely album-oriented rock, one that doesn't have individual, catchy, radio friendly tunes--you need to listen to it beginning to end to get the feel of it.    Even though some fans (I believe a small percentage) don't like it, I personally think it's the best we've seen of them.  And I think the claims that Chris and the band made a record for the critics, are trying to be something they're not, etc. is ridiculous. Without knowing them personally of course, I believe that all along they've made music with a lot of honesty and integrity.    Bravo Coldplay!

B0019IB26I|4.0|A nice mix of tracks, well played, well recorded and appreciated by the crowd.  Mayer demonstrates that he can do sensitive troubadour,Dad rock , soul and , for me the best genre, blues .  I had never heard anything by him till I heard a bootleg of one of his secret blues shows. That recording blew me away.How come he'd slipped under my radar? the boy can sing and play like he was twice as old.He deserves to be regarded alongside Joe Bonamassa and Anthony Gomes as a leader in the vanguard of the next generation of White boys playing the blues. He may not be the fastest, but he presses all the buttons.  One niggle- one of my fav Mayer tracks, Daughters , is here only as an acoustic version, and good as it is, a full band version would have been the icing on the cake....and how about a\\"surprise disc\\" or an \\"official bootleg \\" of one of those blues gigs- that'll get you major kudos from all those \\"Best Blues\\" listers around the world!

It's a novel that you have to be a little patient with and watch the characters unfold and intersect with each other.  It was, despite the subject matter, a beautiful story and one that will stay with you.  I think women especially will relate, but it's also a good read for men.
B00177Y9ZC|3.0|Jumper is about a guy name David played by Hayden Christensen that can teleport almost anyplace on earth.  He found out he had this ability really by accident, and he thinks for a while he is the only person that can teleport.  David eventually starts living the good life, simply by taking what's not his and traveling the world by using his supernatural powers.  The villian played by Samuel L. Jackson arrives mixing up his perfect world, and the character David soon realizes he is not the only jumper in the world.  And so the story goes on with David trying to save his girlfriend played by Rachel Bilson and to get away from Samuel L. Jackson's character.<br /><br />I don't really have a character in this story that I truly liked.  But as for the movie as a whole, I thought it was fast paced, full of special effects, and looks like it would be a lot of fun to teleport (but not into water).  In the end, I lost track with all the jumping into different places and all, but it ended with somewhat of a happy ending.  So, I didn't really didn't question what happened.  Samuel L. Jackson's character did not win.  Hayden Christensen's character got the girl, but still lost out on someone he really wanted in his life.<br /><br />I thought the movie was okay.  I was a bit disappointed overall, but I thought the special effects were exciting.<br /><br />Thanks.
B0014XCMVM|4.0|Well this was a much anticipated cd it really took me back about 10 years ago when she released her greatest cd collection i felt this cd was a little diffrent a little more mellow sounding but i enjoyed it. I recommend this cd to anyone that is a alanis fan. Keep rockin Alanis we all love you
B0014I4KIK|4.0|I haven't bought a CD in a very long time, and I decided to take a chance and buy Duffy's CD based on the first song released.  I usually don't do that because I don't want to get a whole CD and be disappointed because it has only one good song.  But after listening to it, I was not disappointed.  Duffy has impressed me with her style of singing.<br /><br />Her music is fresh, and has an old feel that is meaningful that I greatly appreciate.  Her voice is powerful, deeply soulful, and sweet but on the verge of being rough.  I could tell she sung her heart out on every song.<br /><br />My favorite song on the whole CD is \\"Delayed Devotion\\".  I don't know if it will ever catch on with everyone else, but I like singing along to it.  It is a fun song to sing with.  It's on repeat most of the time in my car.  When I want to hear something different, I change it over to the first song, \\"Rockferry\\".  Yep, that goes on repeat, too, for a while.  Then at times \\"Warwick Avenue\\" goes on repeat, and of course \\"Mercy\\". \\"I'm Scared\\" gets repeated, too, aaaloottt. Yep, I got repeat-itis, bad.<br /><br />I can't speak and say that you will like this CD, too. I think her music is a personal taste, and you have to discover for yourself if it's worth your while.  She may be an acquired taste to some.  Overall, to me, it is a great CD.  I'm glad to have it in my small collection of music.<br /><br />Thanks.

0671799320|5.0|One of the few books that I enthusiastically have recommended.  Great historical information for history buffs.  Great economic information and how it effects us even today. It will truely help you understand the dynamics of war, politics, oil.
0316143472|5.0|I love cynical writings so David Sedaris is one of my favorites though this book is a bit more introspective and sensitive. As he gets older, he thinks things through more and understands the weaknesses and silliness of others and has come to understand their situations. Amazon had the best price on the book and I like that they mail in boxes so damage isn't done to the contents. Most sellers would use a bag for a book. I highly recommend both the book and the seller.
B000PTYP5C|3.0|Dream Theater sounds like a band that copied a bunch of other bands from many years before, such as Kansas, Rush, Iron Maiden, and Queensryche.  Combine all those bands and you get Dream Theater.    While the songwriting on this album is pretty good, it's mostly worth giving a chance for the instrumental parts, which always move forward in a creative direction, and always evolve into different themes (sometimes radically different).  I'm NOT impressed with the way the guitar playing more often than not heads in a generic direction that just about EVERY commercial rock band has done in the last 15 years.    The lyrics though... man, I just don't like the lyrics.  They always feel contrived and uninteresting to me.  The singer is questionable as well.  His voice is alright, but his ability to create vocal melodies is lackluster most of the time.     Still, it's a decent effort.
0307265730|5.0|I thought this book was one of the best collection of short stories that I have read, particularly in the context of an immigrant's perspective.<br /><br />What I particularly enjoy about Jhumpa is that she writes about ordinary people and examines their tensions and anxieties, their joys and disappointments. Her characters are multi dimensional, and she is able to show that ordinary persons are interesting and even fascinating. In an era when literature, film and media is full of abnormal (improbable) characters, it is refreshing to find an artist who is able to appreciate and elevate the ordinary, and imbue it with extraordinary fullness and interest.<br /><br />Of course from an immigrant's point of view, she fully explores the uncertainty, the aloneness, the ambiguity that many of us feel because of our lack of not being fully at home. She expresses the tensions we experience and does it with great compassion and gentleness; seldom providing answers, but always questioning and probing<br /><br />A wonderful experience that I would recommend to everyone
B000000XB9|5.0|If there is a single Classic Rock disc to own, this would be it. When you consider this music provided the soundtrack to the Vietnam War, you might consider buying it to  be owning a bit of history. Go back up above and read down those song titles. Do you have any fond memories associated with any of them? My problem, at age 56, is that I have a fond memory associated with EVERY ONE OF THEM.<br /><br />Now CCR plays music that's pretty accessible to everyone that hears it, but when you go below that layer, the things that make the songs stand up for all these years is dynamic songwriting and kickass musicianship across the board.<br /><br />If you don't believe me, pick up the concert DVD by John Fogerty: The Long Road Home and SEE these hits performed. I believe it's impossible to be unaffected by what you see and hear there. He still performs his music with that 'fire in the belly' you like to see in older musicians.<br /><br />So back to this disc... he originally recorded these in his 20's. Imagine the 'fire in the belly' factor then...<br /><br />This one is good stuff. You need to own it.
B000ZLFALI|5.0|This DVD is perfect in every way.  The story line involves a group of young people in the 1960s with the backdrop of the counterculture movement, along with the protests against the VN war, all to the tunes of the Beatles.  There have been so many '60s films -- yet this one is totally fresh.  The talent of the performers was amazing, each one simply masterful.  The choreography was riviting -- stunning.  The scene in the recruitment center reminded me of the Joffrey Ballet's \\"Green Table.\\"  I hate to speak only in hyperbole, but this film is worth it.  I recommend it wholeheartedly.
B000YENUI6|5.0|What a difference it makes when your retinue sees your vision! Here is the second Cronenberg  movie with Viggo Mortensen, and with this oeuvre, the auteur finally enters the ranks of film's great directors. Thanks mainly to Mortensen, Cronenberg's sometimes incoherent, often dissipated eye focuses its lens.    Cronenberg's genius has always been to lead the viewer down rabbit holes, but he often strands them there. Mortensen won't allow that to happen. He values his director to much to allow him to be fettered in gordian knots. Many of Cronenberg's previous movies have suffered from his lead actor's inability to realize this. Gabriel Byrne came very close in 2002's \\"Spider.\\" If only Maria Bello could have been brought aboard too. Her interpretation of Cronemberg is just as strong as Mortensen, and together they made 2005's \\"History of Violence\\" one of Cronenberg's strongest films. Ms. Watts gave it a brave attempt, but utlimately came nowhere near as good as Bello would have been.    Perhaps too, there has been a void left in the Earth's culture since Bergman passed. \\"Eastern Promises\\" seemed almost an homage to the late auteur. Much of the camera work could almost be a direct imitation of many techniques invented by the Swede. While these touts were charming enough, I don't think they should be repeated in the future. Cronenberg has realized how to part the curtain, and show us reality flickering beneath the lights. I have enough faith in his craft to eagerly await his next release.     Certainly this film is the most accessible of all Cronenberg movies. It may even be his best. I would recommend that a first-time viewer of Cronenberg's work see this first, then invest in a retrospective.

B0013LPS8Y|4.0|U2's third album was unleashed on an expectant world in 1983 and launched them as a genuine global phenomenon. This long overdue CD Remaster is released today, Monday 21 July 2008 in the UK and then 22 July 2008 in the USA and other territories. Also released today are \\"Boy\\", their 1980 debut and \\"October\\" their second album from 1981. The Edge has personally overseen the remastering of all of them utilizing the same team that brought us the amazing quality re-issue of \\"The Joshua Tree\\" last year.<br /><br />DISCS:<br />Here in the UK, \\"War\\" (like the others) comes in no less than 4 physical variants. The single CD is a straightforward remaster with an extended and upgraded booklet (it's one of those new round corner jewel cases) and costs £10. The second is this issue - the 2CD Deluxe Version at £20 - the 2nd disc being the B-sides of singles and new previously unreleased mixes. The third variant is a Limited Edition containing the 2CD Deluxe Edition housed in a DVD sized card box with a T-Shirt of the album sleeve - it costs a frankly ludicrous £35 and is a waste of space and money in my book. Last is the humble 10-track LP - it's housed in a repro of the original gatefold sleeve and is pressed on 180 grams vinyl with upgraded liner notes  - it costs £15 and is a limited edition. THIS REVIEW IS FOR THE 2CD DELUXE EDITION and the SINGLE DISC EDITION.<br /><br />Here's the layout:<br />Disc 1 is the 10 track original album, issued March 1983 on Island ILPS 9733, remastered 2008 (42:11 minutes)<br /><br />Disc 2 is the B-sides of 7\\" and 12\\" singles from Germany, the UK and the USA along with two later remixes of \\"New Year's Day\\" - all tracks remastered in 2008. It should also be noted that the CD lists 12 tracks, but the booklet lists only 11 - and in the wrong order! Looks like the track list was changed at the last minute, but the booklet wasn't upgraded to reflect this - a bit sloppy to say the least considering the expensive price of the 2disc set. Whether this is a mistake or a hidden track is unsaid, but the song not listed on the packaging is number two, \\"Angels Too Tied To The Ground\\" (59:29 minutes)<br /><br />PACKAGING:<br />Housed in an outer hard card sleeve is a 36-page hardback booklet with lyrics, album history by noted writer NIALL STOKES, 7\\" singles pictured, photo outtakes from the videos and a detailed breakdown of the tracks on Disc 2. The 26-page single disc booklet is extended for the deluxe one by about 12 pages and there are informative notes by The Edge on how and why some of the B-sides were recorded. Both the single CD and 2CD set are picture discs with 2 members of the band on Disc 1 and the other 2 on Disc 2. A nice touch in the 2CD set is the way the card leaves that hold the CDs have slits at their base to let the disc slide out a fraction (it would have cut through anyway).  It's a small thing, but nice attention to detail. The packaging is good (apart from that track list), and classily presented, but the best bit is the SOUND...<br /><br />SOUND:<br />Remastered by ARNIE ACOSTA at Bernie Grundman Mastering, the tapes and remasters were also overseen by THE EDGE and the quality achieved is FANTASTIC! I've waited like most fans for over 20 years to hear \\"Seconds\\", \\"Drowning Man\\", \\"Surrender\\" and \\"40\\" in truly great sound quality and this re-issue delivers that in dollops. The drums are clear and loud, the guitars and keyboards passages leaping out of the speakers at you - the great guitar work given the muscle it needs - as I say - FANTASTIC STUFF. Fans will really delight to this.<br /><br />EXTRAS:<br />The extras, however, are a very mixed bag. \\"Endless Deep\\" is the non-album B-side to the German and UK 7\\" singles of \\"Sunday Bloody Sunday\\" and is a sort of a meandering instrumental - interesting but hardly great. \\"Angels Too Tied To The Ground\\" is much better though and new to me - it's got to be an outtake from the sessions - musically it sounds like a rehearsal for \\"New Year's Day\\". It'sa fully formed song and would have made a great B-side - it's a superb little ditty - and without question one of the best surprises on here. Fans will eat this one up. Unfortunately, tracks 5 and 6 are - in my mind - absolute travesties. They're 1999 Ferry Corsten remixes of \\"New Year's Day\\" which sound like those endless crap versions that came off \\"Pop\\" CD singles - they're staggeringly inappropriate to an 1983 album and its unique sound.  What were they thinking about - tagging these on here - they're so out of place as to be laughable?  \\"Treasure...\\" is the B-side to the UK issue of \\"New Year's Day\\" while 10, 11 and 12 make up the 3 other songs on the UK double 7\\" pack of \\"New Year's Day\\". The live tracks are good, but not that well recorded. All in all, with 4 mixes of \\"New\\" and 3 mixes of \\"Two\\", Disc 2 is a very boring and disjointed experience. In truth, I doubt I'll be returning to these soon, despite their rarity value.<br /><br />To sum up, Disc 1 is 10 out of 10, but Disc 2 is pushing 5.<br /><br />\\"War\\" is a superb U2 album and still stands up to this day - and this great remaster has only reminded us of that. Shame that Disc 2 lets the side down somewhat. Fans will have to own the 2CD Deluxe Edition, while the casual buyer should opt for the single disc version instead. On its own, it's a superlative remastered reissue.perb little ditty - and without question one of the best surprises on here. Fans will eat this one up.

B0017I1FP8|5.0|I got the soundtrack the day it was released, and I actually preferred the soundtrack to Batman Begins at the time...but then I saw the movie, and then The Dark Knight soundtrack began to quickly rise up and become my favorite soundtrack. I have listened to it non-stop for the past few days, and I just think that it captures the mood of the film and the feelings from the film very well. I really hope Hans Zimmer and James Newton Howard work together in the future on more soundtracks, besides the sequel to The Dark Knight that we know will happen in a few years.     One thing that I have began to notice more about this soundtrack than the Batman Begins soundtrack is that, while the Batman Begins soundtrack did not have a real theme for Batman, this movie begins to take some of the themes associated with Batman, and bringing more character and flesh to it, while not being a full theme, it has began to grow as the character of Batman has grown in the movies. I think it is just pure genius.    I highly recommend this to anybody who loves Batman.
B0012Q732O|1.0|This movie is not worth buying or watching again one times enough. There wasn't enough special effects to this film and it is a boring film. The movie started off real good for about an hour then went down hill after the tiger left the scene and the tiger was the best part about the film but you only get to see the tiger for like 5 min. A stupid movie...
B000JLQSQU|2.0|[[ASIN:B000R9RGF6 Divenire]]  The music on this album is wonderful (heard several tracks on a local Classical Music Station. I own one of the Artists (Ludovico Einaudi) earlier albums, which was produced by BMG. The quality of the music is matched by the quality of the recording, over-all CD and packaging.  The Artists newest album, DIVENIRE, as purchased from Amazon is produced by a company called \\"Ponderosa Music & Art\\" and made in the EU. The packaging is cardboard cover, not great but OK. I personally prefer the full size plastic covers with rear insert listing the names of the tracks, the track # and sometimes the playing time of the track. The information printed on the DIVENIRE album cover is minimal at best and only lists the track names. An insert \\"booklet\\" provides some additional information about the music and other Artists on the CD. Overall the cover is attractively done, just not what I would prefer. The appearance of the CD is Satin Black on the printed side with a narrow outer band in Chrome lettering, providing the name of the Artist and Album, as well as copyright info. The Chrome lettering looks like it is already starting to fail, maybe not bonded well to the CD media.  The greatest disappointment with this CD is that the first one received from Amazon would not play consistently in my Bose Music system, very intermittent at best. That CD was returned to Amazon and a replacement was here in three days. A side note here, Customer Service at Amazon is really great!   CD #2 arrived today and once again it will not play in the Bose Wave Radio/CD Player. It will play in the component music system, when placed in the Sony CD/DVD player and there it does sound very good. I am very disappointed that the CD will not play in the player used the most. Another side note, \\"the Bose system is several years old, used daily and this is the first CD that has not played as one would expect\\". I like the music so well when it is played on the Sony player, I just may keep it.  I would hope that Ludovico Einaudi will find a Producer for his next album that will put as much care and quality into the packaged product as Ludovico puts into his music.    Arnie Rodman    .
0740748475|5.0|I had never read much Calvin & Hobbes, but thought it was both clever and cute.  My 14 year-old had a little exposure last year and really liked the characters.  I purchased this set as a gift when it was a Gold Box Deal just before Christmas; the price was impossible to pass on.  Unsolicited, Amazon later reimbursed me for the shipping.     All I can say is that he has read through each of the volumes at least four times, maybe more, and still occasionally laughs out loud.  I can't count the number of times I've found him in his room, a half-hour after bed-time, poring over a book and protesting when I tell him lights out.  He absolutely loves this series.    I haven't noticed any deterioration of the bindings or covers, and my son hasn't said anything about it.  Although I do take care with books and do get irritated when a book starts deteriorating prematurely, in this case I'm not concerned; I'd rather see them in tatters from use than pristine and unread.    I suspect the \\"perfect\\" complete edition would put the price out of consideration for most people, especially young people.  And that would be a shame.
B0013D8LCW|5.0|Shelter is an incredible story that makes you feel something for these characters during and after the movie.  Gorgeous actors and played with true heart and feeling for the characters.  I highly recommend this film over almost any gay film that has been produced.  A MUST SEE.  I'm purchasing the DVD right now.<br /><br />In addition to this great watch, the music in this movie is awesome.  Never heard of Shane Mack but now I love his song \\"More Than This\\".

B0017R5UAA|5.0|Fleet Foxes' debut self-titled LP is a beautiful, haunting affair of sweeping folk arrangements infused with a gruff, powerful Southern rock presence. The sound of the record is a stunning synthesis of the rock and roll of Band of Horses paired with the spacious production and arrangements of Panda Bear's Person Pitch. The album's opener is a cunning track, lulling the listener into low expectations in the first 20 seconds with a dull country-sounding harmony, only to be blow that listener away with an explosion of varied instrumentation. Opener \\"Sun It Rises\\" is followed with \\"White Winter Hymnal,\\" which starts out with a simple repeated chant that slowly builds to a gorgeous old-western guitar riff.<br /><br />The vocal harmonies on Fleet Foxes are incredibly compelling and simply beg the listener to learn the words and sing along. I dare say that it would be impossible for someone to listen to this record a few times without feeling the irresistible urge to hum and sing. The album constantly evolves and expands track by track, and though there are a few weak moments, such as the tepid closing track \\"Oliver James,\\" the music is by and large original, brilliant, and inventive. One of the best new albums of the year thus far, Fleet Foxes takes a simple folk concept and turns it on its head, infusing the simplicity of folk with the creative instrumentation of leading indie bands such as the Decemberists. For indie music fans, Fleet Foxes is a must-listen.
1400034779|5.0|I'm not entirely sure what genre \\"The #1 Ladies' Detective Agency\\" fits into, and that may be why I resisted reading it for a long time. I avoid books that get a lot of press by mainstream media (like the Today Show, Oprah, Regis, etc.), figuring it is just a sellout and not real praise. However, this book has real charm and a sweetness about it. No twisty Agatha Christie style plot, just a compassionate lady using her brain, intuition and common sense. The author communicates atmosphere beautifully and paints the culture and landscape of Botswana with a loving brush.
B0013LPS8E|5.0|from the beginning drum intro for \\"Sunday Bloody Sunday\\" the sound of the music is 100% better than the original dry  CD release. every song has a new life it makes me love the album even more than i did. compared to the joshua tree as a whole this cd is my favorite U2 cd. now REMASTER The UNFORGETTABLE FIRE AND ACHTUNG BABY ANd ill be happy!

The songs are amazing and she shines especially in \\"I Surrender\\" and \\"River Deep Mountain high\\"!  She is incredible in the meet and greet on disc 1.  She is so nice and normal, and so sweet and generous to the people she meets and takes time to really talk to each and every person in the room as a long time friend or family member.  The extra features are excellent.  This is definitely worth the price, dont hesitate to buy this, you'll be glad when you get this.

0316143472|5.0|I've read David Sedaris' other books, and I wouldn't recommend doing it in public unless you enjoy being stared at by the people around you as you miserably fail to stifle your disruptive laughter.  \\"Me Talk Pretty One Day\\" proved to be particularly disabling to read: I frequently laughed to the point of uselessness.<br /><br />I had a couple of similar experiences while reading \\"Engulfed\\", but it was different than his past books too.  I would say it's just as good as his previous works, but has a slightly different aim than they did.  What Sedaris always does so well is keenly analyze things that most of us experience but immediately dismiss in the press day to day life.  Instead of moving on, Sedaris lingers and recounts his experiences for his reader or listener with quirky insights that frequently remind you of your own fleeting thoughts or emotions in similar situations.<br /><br />To me, that is the underlying appeal of David Sedaris.  Typically, his insights are uproariously funny.  In this case, they're a little more poignant and chuckle-inducing, but the experience of recognizing my own foibles in Sedaris' skewering of his own foibles is still the same treat it's been in the past.<br /><br />Highly recommended for fans of Sedaris and for anyone who likes off-center insights on the world.

B000I9VZKW|5.0|This was perfect sci-fi distraction. For the third movie I watched in a row today, it still fully held my interest, which I consider a testament to just how well done it is. Of course there is some extent to which all sci-fi is cliche after you've been following the genre for decades, but this movie manages to make the old new again. The dialogue was fun. The characters likable. The plot twists were sufficient to keep you thinking, but not so overdone you had to scratch your head and try to make sense of it.     There was even a healthy dose of food for thought, in terms of the nature of the sense of \\"self,\\" how this develops, and what having one implies.

B0016A2FFG|5.0|Unbelievably soulful! Every time I listen I still find it a miracle that this man's music is better than it was back in 1970's.  As a DJ at my college radio station, way back then, I really enjoyed playing Al Green records.  Over the past year I have downloaded a bunch of old Al Green for my Ipod.  Amazon saw that and sent me an update about this CD's release, and I'm sure glad they did. All of the tunes are right up there with his old material.  In fact, in some cases, I think he has surpassed his old stuff. Rev Green's voice is as good as it ever was, and the musicians accompanying him are outstanding.  The producers of the CD knew what they were doing by not overcrowding the music.  Al Green's music is beautiful and intimate.  This CD let's all that come through
B001CFOPMQ|5.0|This review is for the downloadable version of The Slip that has been available for free on the NIN website for several months. Today (07/22/08) the same MP3-only version of the album (with ten songs) was made available here on AMZN, along with the limited-edition physical CD. I know nothing about the bonus DVD that comes with that package. Here I am reviewing the music of The Slip for the benefit of fans wondering about the album. The bonus DVD on the physical release is probably only essential for collectors or those uncomfortable with downloading. But note that the album's music is still available for free on the NIN website (apparently forever), and Trent Reznor is obviously willing to forego royalties in order to cut out the middlemen who distribute physical products.<br /><br />The digital music era has freed Trent from record company strictures, and he sure is active lately, as The Slip is technically his fourth album-length product in about a year (though the double Ghosts I-IV should be regarded as an experimental side project). I was not too enthralled by Year Zero, finding it forced and unfocused, but The Slip is much more coherent and self-contained, with Trent displaying a sense of \\"Discipline\\" that allows him to both look forward and build upon his past strengths. The blistering \\"Letting You\\" recalls Trent's classics of barely-contained rage, and the fascinating \\"Echoplex\\" recalls some of the moody experimentation of The Fragile. The quiet and haunting \\"Lights in the Sky\\" is surely Trent's best piano ballad ever. The two extended atmospheric experiments, \\"Corona Radiata\\" and \\"The Four of Us Are Dying\\" hearken back to the most terrifying quiet moments of The Downward Spiral while also feeling fresh and forward-looking. The only misstep is the weak whispered vocals on \\"Demon Seed,\\" though that track is still a powerful close to Trent's most focused album is recent memory.<br /><br />In fact, this might be the tightest collection of songs in the history of NIN. Trent no longer has the need to create albums as lengthy as record companies want when they want them. Faithful NIN fans should get their hands on this, either physically or virtually.

B00125WAWS|3.0|The setting is 1930s Texas, with plentiful portrayals of the barbaric and murderous treatment doled out to blacks by whites of the day.     The story is ostensibly portrayed as factual. Wikipedia's portrayal of the film's subject matter indicate that much in the movie is not factual including the entire story that there was ever a Harvard debate.    Although the movie holds one's attention, and doesn't come across as overdone, the strategy of mixing near fantasy with some of the horrific subject matter is in my opinion; disturbing.     The story is about a debate team consisting of black students, that actually existed and who overcame overwhelming obstacles including racism. Through their victories they showed other Americans that our black citizens are as great as any other race. If it is true that this team never actually debated Harvard though, why rewrite history? Is it that the movie makers felt that the actual accomplishments depicted are not movie worthy?      In spite of all of the above, everyone can benefit from seeing the film because we all need to be reminded of past atrocities so that we will not shrink from those of the present. I just feel that the film-makers should have provided my inquisitive mind with more of the real story and less of the embellishment.

0060005696|5.0|My husband and I, both professionals (he's an attorney, I'm a psychologist), had previously had many conversations about how the plethora of choices available in modern-day life--from being able to find virtually every TV program ever made online to owning an iPod that can hold every song we'd want to hear to having access to endless reviews on amazon whenever we need to purchase a new product--somehow seemed detrimental to us, although we were never able to quite put our finger on the precise nature of the problem.  So, when we came across the book The Paradox of Choice, we were amazed to find that author Barry Schwartz had done research into exactly phenomenon we had been discussing with each other.<br /><br />In this book, Schwartz makes a distinction between \\"satisficers,\\" those who are able to ignore the vast majority of options available and accept the first choice which meets all of their needs, versus \\"maximizers,\\" those who are convinced that the perfect choice exists and who are willing to ignore the costs associated with searching for this \\"perfect\\" option.  Schwartz does as an excellent job of showing that maximizers tend to be more depressed and anxious.  But then he moves away from the specific topic of choice to discuss the more general subject of happiness.  Here Schwartz reviews some of my favorite research in psychology, including Dr. Martin Seligman's work with learned helplessness and his more recent expansion into the positive psychology field.  Schwartz also references the book Stumbling on Happiness by Daniel Gilbert; Dr. Gilbert makes the point that we are all particularly poor predictors of what will make us happy.<br /><br />In the final part of this book, Schwartz offers some strategies for dealing with the overwhelming amount of options in today's world.  Although this is certainly not designed as a self-help book per se, these recommendations build on both Schwartz's own research as well as the work of the above-mentioned psychologists and are designed to help the reader find greater happiness amidst the sea of modern-day choices.  I would recommend this book to anyone looking for a highly readable account of this fascinating topic.nd are designed to help the reader find greater happiness amidst the sea of modern-day choices.

B00028U6B8|5.0|Jefferson Airplane always had a little bite to their \\"We Can Be Together\\" politics.  Living at the epicenter of hippie culture in San Francisco as they were, it's hard to duck the flowers and beads when talking about their musical aesthetic -- sort of Haight-Ashbury's answer to the guitar sounds the Velvet Underground was making, plus a heady dose of electric and country blues, plus 3 and sometimes 4 way vocals, plus incendiary musical change-ups that hinted at sprawling psychedelic vistas.<br /><br />A case in point is \\"Turn My Life Down,\\" a concise track that starts with a fairly standard coffee-shoppish slide guitar before nimbly slipping into Laurel Canyon-style guitars and Hammonds.  Then, suddenly at about 1-and-a-half minutes, the song tranforms into a romping pop melody and searing guitar counterpoint, nearly lifting the track right out of the stereo.<br /><br />The title track \\"Volunteers,\\" \\"The Farm,\\" and \\"Good Shepherd\\" all espouse a back-to-nature agenda while simultaneously pointing an accusatory finger at religious zealots and political opportunists.  But rather than being soap-boxy, these come off as beautifully constructed songs, scintillating in a raggedy way that is most often attributed to early Neil Young.<br /><br />If you were concerned things were going to be a bit treacly and trapped in dated politics, Grace Slick delivers two songs that make it clear she was the Kim Gordon of her day.  \\"Hey Fredrick\\" and \\"Eskimo Blue Day\\" are unflinching and raw -- \\"Either go away, or go all the way in\\" snarls Slick in the former tune.  He voice soars over ambiguous lyrics that seem to search out some sort of meaning in religious and interpersonal dynamics.  It could have been a boring graduate-level lecture... or it could be the dynamic and provocative polemic that she delivers here.  You don't even notice nearly 9 minutes have passed.  She is equally demanding in \\"Eskimo Blue Day,\\" reminding us in no uncertain terms that \\"the human name doesn't mean @#$% to a tree.\\"<br /><br />As if to rub salt into the wide eyes of stupefied right-wingers who may have heard the album in its day, one of the closing songs is a tremulous organ reading of \\"Meadowlands,\\" a communist-affiliated anthem much-reviled by the \\"Red Scare\\" set.<br /><br />Another quote from the previously mentioned \\"We Can Be Together\\" is below.  For as rewarding and generally uplifting as this album listens, the Airplane was out for blood -- striking a blow for the youth and pulling no punches in alienating apathists, poseurs, and opportunists.  It's delivered with excellent musicianship and some thrilling left-turns too, making this album a real accomplishment from its era.  One of my period favorites -- enjoy!<br /><br />\\"We are forces of chaos and anarchy, everything they say we are we are, and we are very proud of ourselves.\\"ub salt into the wide eyes of stupefied right-wingers who may have heard the album in its day, one of the closing songs is a tremulous organ reading of \\"Meadowlands,\\" a communist-affiliated anthem much-reviled by the \\"Red Scare\\" set.

0743290119|2.0|The story of 3 friends with different love life issues is a familiar one, but in this particular book, there seems not to be ENOUGH of a story - I skim read the last third of the book, hoping to find a story!!       With characters that I didn't like or care for and a plodding to non-existent storyline, this made for a book that is easy to put down, and forget to pick up again.    But in saying this, I didn't feel it was as bad as some of the reviews said - just not what I had hoped for from this author.

B001CD6FKI|4.0|Perhaps the most underrated film of summer '08, Speed Racer was a completely enjoyable film to a watch; a wonderful experience that was made to be seen on the big screen. It's hard to understand why so many critics hated this movie. It's got action, style, and heart. Sure it's a \\"family film,\\" but it's a damn good one. It's rare to find a family film this sweet. Now doubt in my mind, the Wachoski brothers have another hit on their hands but this time around, no one seems to see it.<br /><br />The visual style of Speed Racer is trippy and unique. A wide range of colors filled the screen which equally match the vibrant intensity and fun tone of the film. All the cars have that retro trendy look including the newly-designed Mach 6. And the good ol' Mach 5's never looked better. At times I didn't even realize some of the backdrops were CGI because they were just so stunning to see. The Wachoski Bros have really created a \\"live-action anime\\" by presenting a look and feel that isn't quite fully 2-D or 3-D. Never before have I seen the artistic creativity as seen in Speed Racer. Sure I wouldn't have minded a full photo-realistic update like what last year's Transformers did, but alas it wouldn't be the same.<br /><br />Another postive aspect of Speed Racer was the sound design and musical score. Thank god the Wachowski's didn't keep the repetitive & droning \\"vroom\\" sound from the original anime show. Instead there are various sounds of every possible noise a car can make from a super engine revving to the remarkable crashes and stunts seen in the film. What they did keep was the unforgettable echoing \\"chyu-chyu-chyu\\" of the jump jacks and the Speed Racer theme. The composer of Speed Racer's music, the award-winning Michael Giacchino (Ratatouille, Lost), reworks the original Speed Racer theme to parts of his score along with his own. Speed Racer's music is more than solid and adds much to this already remarkable film. All together, I couldn't have asked more for the sound design of the movie.<br />(*Fact tidbit* The Speed Racer theme song in the US and Japan have the same melody)<br /><br />Kudos to the casting selection because the actors not only look but act and feel like the original characters. Emile Hirsch surprisingly made a great Speed and Christina Ricci's large eyes and sweet demeanor were meant to play Trixie. John Goodman was a spot-on Pops Racer and Susan Sarandon sure felt like a mother as Mom Racer. Lost's Matthew Fox nailed the role of Racer X's mystique and confident valor. The rest of the cast was swell as well - there was definitely an aspiring chemistry between the actors giving Speed Racer a very convincing performance. In addition, I appreciate casting's choice to keep it ethnically diverse with actors like Korean superstar Rain, Australian Kick Gurry, English Roger Allam, Chinese actress Yu Nan, Benno F&uuml;rmann of Germany, and skilled Japanese actor Hiroyuki Sanada. Last of all on the note of casting, how could I forget the inclusion of Peter Fernandez's cameo as a race commentator? As the director and writer of the US adaptation of the Speed Racer television show as well as the original voice of Speed & Racer X, it would've been a crime not to include this legendary man.<br /><br />A few parts of the film I had mixed feelings on but nothing about the film did I completely dislike. The scenes with Spritle & Chim Chim got pretty stupid and annoying...of course scenes with them in the original show were just that! The story could've been more dynamic and less complex in its presentation. There are some parts in the middle that unfortunately slow down the movie a little and the whole anti-corporations plot line becomes overly wordy in its dialogue. More time could have been spent on fleshing out the backstories presented in the beginning. Those felt somewhat rushed although they were sufficient. Finally, some of the CGI was a bit too cartoony for my taste such as Royalton's factory filled with Segway traveling workers and the bubbling escape pod-like mechanism of the cars.<br /><br />Overall, I loved the Speed Racer movie. It left me completely content and satisfied. Some scenes had me to tears (death of Rex Racer, Speed's final struggle) and others had me on the edge of my seat as cars zoomed about the twisting and curving racetrack. I really couldn't ask more from Speed Racer. Aside from the Death Note films, Speed Racer's one of the best live-action anime adaptations and it's a shame it probably won't be expanded further (the Wachoski Brothers have plot ideas that would make Speed Racer a trilogy but it is unlikely those ideas will be fulfilled after Speed Racer's unfortunate low box-office performance). Hopefully, it can rebound enough from sales of related products and DVD sales to make Warner Bros. reconsider continuing this wonderful start to a trilogy.<br /><br />4 stars out of 5<br /><br />GO SPEED RACER GO!mechanism of the cars.

0345404475|4.0|Androids, of course, became Blade Runner, and I was happy to see how faithful the film was to the book, at least to the main plotline. But of course, the film left out half the story: the animals. In this postwar environment, most of the animals in the world are dead from fallout. All the surviving humans need to have a pet, and if they can't afford a real live one they make due with ersatz electrics. Deckard is bummed because he has an electric sheep on his roof, and he's anxious to kill the latest batch of escaped androids to use the bounty money to buy a real animal. This valuation of the lives of the fake animals over the fake humans, very sophisticated life forms, different but very nearly the equal of man, provides a kind of Clockwork Orange ethical overtone to the story. One little tidbit I enjoyed (and I love the way many Dick books take place in the Bay Area) was, the repairers of electric animals pretend to be real veterinarians, with their white vans and coats. The Van Ness Animal Hospital, one of these services, is where we used to take our cat.    Of course, there are supernatural forces at play in this book that one has come to expect from the best of Dick. The weirdest is the world religion of Mercerism, and the empathy boxes (left behind by alien visitors?) which allow the decimated and dysfunctional survivors of Earth to fuse into the figure of Mercer, as he climbs the same hill over and over, and rocks come flying out of nowhere to strike him. The participants of the experience find real wounds from the rocks on their bodies when they reemerge into their living rooms.    There is one eerie scene that is explained away in the same flawed manner that Lou Stathis complained about in his foreword to Dick's earlier Time Out of Joint, when he observed that \\"...nightmares do not follow real-world logic, and the irrational can never be satisfactorily explained by the rational.\\"  In this scene, the fake cops come to arrest Deckard and take him to the big main police station south-of-market, the baroque Mission Street Hall of Justice, which Deckard has never heard-of before. This scene scared the hell out of me: it's like Deckard has been suddenly projected into a parallel universe. \\"The Hall of Justice,\\" Rick said, \\"is north, on Lombard.\\"    \\"That's the old Hall of Justice,\\" Officer Crams said. \\"The new one is on Mission. That old building, it's disintegrating; it's a ruin. Nobody's used that for years.\\" The explanation, an android conspiracy, is a letdown, but that was the only flaw I found in this exemplary book.
0312323867|5.0|First of all, it kind of annoys the crap out of me that anything written by a woman, without a dark and intense cover, is devalued as \\"chick lit\\".  If \\"Something Blue\\" was written by a man, people would describe it as extremely sensitive, compelling, though-provoking reading, not \\"brainless\\".<br />I've read of all Giffin's novels, but this was the first one for me. While this book (as well as \\"Something Borrowed\\", it's predecessor), a lot of issues that affect people universally are examined--the underlying competetiveness beneath female friendships that can brew ominously until it bubbles over (a toxic element unique to women--after the four way betrayal, the women were rifted brutally, dead to each other, while the men had an awkward conversation and decided they \\"wouldn't be going out for a few beers anytime soon\\"), rebelling against expectations, the draw of the forbidden, the attraction to the rough trade while still unable to break away from your safety net--crossing class lines is inherently romantic, which is why Darcy's romance with slacker, dirty Marcus is so intoxicating.  It studies the future tripping people have in that early romantic glow--Darcy throwing up her legs after she has unprotected sex with Marcus \\"Swim, spermies, swim!\\", because she wanted the romantic intensity to last, and what's more romantic than star-crossed lovers getting knocked up?  She'd projected Marcus into her future, despite the fact he...well, Marcus sucked.  He totally sucked.<br />My favorite issue, though, was Darcy's realization that the last thing she wanted (motherhood, a cessation of her Cosmo-sipping, Gucci-wearing, club-going, rich dude dating existence) was what eventually redeemed her.  I LOVED that, and I loved her journey.  As someone faced with unexpected motherhood, I went on a similar journey, and Darcy's range of feelings on along the way rang so honest and true to me.  I knew exactly what it was like to fumble to find your footing when you lose everything familiar and have to start from scratch, how hard it is to go against type when evryone arounds you think that they know you, know your limitations, and doubt your maternal instincts.  How you WANT to prove yourself until the day you hold your baby (or babies) and realize how irrelevant everything else is.  I'd never found a way to express it until I read \\"Something Blue\\", and I really rooted for Darcy.  I'm glad I read it before \\"Something Borrowed\\", though, because I probably wouldn't have been nearly open to Darcy otherwise.  I easily could have despised her in \\"Borrowed\\", but when I read that one, I felt like I knew Darcy to well and saw through the cheating bridezilla character.<br />I loved this book.  I reccomend it to anyone, but please read it with an open mind.  It's much more intellgent than \\"chick lit\\", but you have to read deeply.  Don't skim it while you lay on the beach worrying about how your thighs look.

B001ACY8D2|1.0|This CD is a total disappointment. The only excuse is that any band who's been successful for 10 years must release at least one bad album, so there you go. The intro song \\"Gobbledigook\\" is one of the most embarassing songs I've ever heard, just a parody of music as such. Its silliest \\"la-la-la\\" is just a mocking joke from the band who did such deep and solid stuff as \\"Viðrar vel til loftárása\\", \\"Untitled #8\\" and \\"Svo hljótt\\". People below are talking about Sigur Rós trying to do something different and searching for new ways... No way, to me the album sounds like a bunch of rejects from \\"Takk\\", their previous album. \\"Inni í mér syngur vitleysingur\\" is a mean quality remake of \\"Hoppípolla\\", \\"Góðan daginn\\" has shades of \\"Andvari\\", the rest is pretty \\"Takk-ish\\" too, although much less inspiring and worse songwritten. The vocal on \\"Alright\\" is weak and dull. The most important and coolest ingredient of the band's style, Jónsi's guitar bow licks are heard nowhere. And so on. While all SR's previous albums are the nicest pieces of music I've ever heard and unlike to each other as much as it's possible within the same style, this sad release shows that the band have exhausted themselves and are no longer able to keep that great vibe which I thought they would never loose. I only hope that with the next album we'll see decisive improvements to the better.. and hopefully Sigur Rós will reconsider working with this producer, because it looks like he doesn't have a clue what their style is about.
B000YXMMAE|5.0|\\"In Rainbows\\" got a lot of attention for the novel way Radiohead started to sell it.  The music shouldn't be overlooked.  Each song is in the Radiohead style, catchy, and organic.  There are some synth or looped parts, but it sounds like five guys in a room.  Highly recommended.
0679720200|5.0|***SPOILER INCLUDED****    The story based around the deaths of Meursault's mother, a distant acquaintance of his, and his execution is ludicrous, yet the mindsets of the characters are strikingly real and fitting considering the situations that they are faced with.    The plot is just plain ridiculous.  Meursault, the protagonist, subsequent to partaking in his mother's funeral, kills a man because the sun gets in his eyes and he blunders, clicking the trigger, and then letting the barrel pop four more times.      After spending months in jail awaiting a trial, the magistrate tells Meursault that he can be forgiven for his crime, with the help of God.  Meanwhile, the presiding judge believes that Meursault has no soul.  Therein lies the theme of the novel: are Meursault's qualities attributed to an underdeveloped way of thinking and expressing himself, or do his actions speak for themselves, proving that he is all but inhuman, a man,  or even a spectacle, with no soul?  What makes this argument so compelling is that it is easy to identify with Meursault, but his actions take on a role of their own.  He is seemingly indifferent to just about everything, with exception to being imprisoned.  But even that he gets used to.  His carelessness may be due to subconscious depression.  Is he hiding his true feelings?  There's plenty of evidence to argue this point..      When Meursault visits his mother's funeral home, he falls asleep in an abnormal position, possibly so that he doesn't have to deal with his thoughts of his loss.  When he arrives at the home, he notices minute details of all of the old men and women there, including those of the caretaker, the funeral home manager, and Mr. Perez.  He distracts himself from thinking about his mother.  He clearly has feelings for her, however, because later in the novel, when he's in trial, he can't help but be infuriated at himself for not crying on the day of the burial.  When Meursault shoots the Arab five times, he envisions knocking on the door of unhappiness with each hit.  Is he doing himself in because deep down he thinks he deserves it?  Is his crude indifference towards the world mistaken for his open mind and lack of understanding of others, and of himself?    On the other hand, may be merciless and hard headed.  He doesn't know how old his mother was when she died, or exactly when she died, and he is under the impression that being at her funeral is a bother, because he could be doing other things, and later he admits that he deserves to be killed.    Meursault's relationship with his girlfriend, Marie is essential in this novel.  Whether Meursault has a soul or not is debatable, but his admiration for Marie is not.  He uses love as a distraction from his worries, and the pairing of the couple is perfect fit.  Marie appears to be as open minded as Meursault, and while Meursault voices that he doesn't seem to care about much of anything, which might be perceived as an immature viewpoint, Marie demonstrates the same notion through her innocent laughs.  But neither Meursault nor Marie are really innocent.  Marie wants to be with Meursault in bed, and, like Meursault, doesn't seem to have much else on her mind.  Meanwhile, Meursault writes a letter for his friend threatening his friend's girlfriend, and later he hears them fight without intervening.  Yet, in a way, the two still are innocent until they face Meursault's prison sentence and execution.    Meursault is a criminal, whether or not it was his intention, but he has feelings, just like everyone else.  And his thought process makes more sense after his prison sentence than anywhere else in the novel.  The reality of his emotions, during the time he spends in lock up, jump out of the page.  I don't believe this work would have earned Albert Camus the Nobel Prize without the detail in the final pages.  Suddenly, Meursault sees the world in a different light.  He had taken his life for granted when he was a free man, wastingtime watching passer-bys in the street from his porch, keeping anything important from lingering on his mind.  And now the only thing he can think about is his anticipitated death, the most important thing in his life.  Why hadn't he learned more about the guillotine? he wondered.  Why didn't he read books on escaping prison?  Impetuously, Meursault began thinking, but it was too late.  Even without knowing his fate, Meursault could have imagined potential decision based outcomes, such as going through with marrying Marie.  But he had decided not to think, because he didn't have to.  He didn't think when he committed murder.  He didn't even have the ability to think about why he did it.  Was Meursault gutless and cold hearted or did his thoughtlessness become a danger to himself?  The moments leading up to his execution represented a new life for him, as he finally began to think about his previous actions and the tolls they took on himself and everyone who he knew, all of whom testified in court.  He was finally able to see the light, but it was too late.  Even while seated in the courtroom, where there was no way to see the sun, Meursault was able to sense what time of day it was by the sounds outside.  The sun had haunted Meursault throughout the book.  Everywhere he went, he was too hot.  As he killed the Arab, he was attempting to get out of the sun.  But the light is exactly what he needed.  And that's the irony of the novel.      This is not a novel to read for its story.  The plot has little significance in the beauty of \\"The Stranger.\\"  In fact, if someone explained every detail of the book before you read it, they wouldn't be giving much away.  It's the style of Camus's writing, even after surviving a translation, that captures the mind of his readers.  \\"The Stranger\\" is a must read masterpiece of literature.

B001B1UO6W|5.0|Why it took this many years for the distributors to put out a widescreen disc of this film is beyond me... Thankfully, they finally wised up. And it was great to hear that they would also be including a slew of extra features as well.<br /><br />This is one of my favorite movies from the 80's, so I'm glad that it's getting the treatment it deserves... even if it did take 10 years.
1594489505|5.0|WOW! This was every bit as engrossing as The Kite Runner.  The story of two women in war torn Afghanistan is so enlightening, heartbreaking and beautiful, you'll feel as if someone forced your eyes open to watch a horrifying train wreck.  The experience is one you will not soon forget, and you will come out surprisingly richer for it.
B0002OXVDW|5.0|This set of DVDs is a wonderful collection. It is a real treasure, it should be in everyones movie collection.
B00166QJRU|5.0|The product description makes no mention of the fact that this is a mini-box set - just 1 CD, but cool repro postcards, a mini-poster, and a nice booklet, all well-designed.<br />This does soften the blow of the price tag in my opinion.<br />The audio quality is greatly improved over any version you may have heard in the past; as for the performances, there's a reason this gig is legendary.<br />Recommended.
B0013LPS7U|5.0|Although U2's real debut came in early 1979 with 'Three' the band broke onto the scene with 'Boy,' from 1980. They had recently been signed to major label Island Records, which was home to bands like Bob Marley & The Wailers in the '70s. 'Three' was released on CBS.    But anyway, this is where it all started. Right here. 'Boy,' their major label debut, gave them their first hit, 'I Will Follow' and contained such fan favorites like the eight minute 'An Cat Dubh/Into The Heart,' one of my personal favorites 'Shadows and Tall Trees' and the early-U2 concert classic 'Twilight.'    The bonus disc is where things get interesting. If you are a casual U2 fan, just buy the standard edition of 'Boy.' However, if you are a lifelong, die-hard U2 fan like I am, than this is a real treat!     The original version of '11 O'Clock Tick Tock' should have made the original cut. I don't understand why it didn't. This song is a great one, and while many people know it from 'Under A Blood Red Sky,' I prefer the studio version. (Note: For those who haven't heard the studio version, you are in for a real treat!)    The previously unreleased tracks 'Speed of Life' and 'Saturday Night' have a more punk rock sound. Clearly influenced by bands like The Clash and The Jam, these songs proves U2 can make great punk.     And finally, 'Three' is available on CD! This is what I've been waiting for for years! This is the real highlight of the disc! 'Boy/Girl' is a classic, and another really good punk rocker. The live version from London in early 1980 that is also featured here is superb as well. And what a treat it is to hear the original 'Out of Control' and 'Stories for Boys'! The songs have a much more punk rock sound here than they do in their 'Boy' album versions.     The final two unreleased tracks that are featured here is a rare, previously unreleased live version of '11 O'Clock Tick Tock' from London in early 1980, and 'Cartoon World' a non-album track that was recorded live in Dublin. Both are really cool.     'Another Day' was released as a single in mid-1979 on CBS Records. This song is a classic. Any U2 fan, whether casual or die-hard like myself, needs to hear this song. It is, without a doubt, one of my personal favorite U2 songs. Another really great one is the instrumental 'Things to Make and Do.' I own a rare live bootleg from Boston in 1981 where that song is performed. Although this version is great, I have to say, I prefer the live Boston version instead.    'Touch,' from late '79, is another one of my personal favorites. The lyrics are great, Bono's voice and The Edge's guitar is great, especially the opening riff.     Overall, the deluxe edition of 'Boy' is the version that you need to own. Everything is digitally remastered, so the sound quality is awesome, and the bonus tracks make it really worthwhile.    This edition of 'Boy' is highly recommended for any U2 fan that wants to hear early U2 at their finest. You won't regret this purchase.     ENJOY!!!
B001AIG41K|5.0|'Whiskey Myers': A Singing Group For The Ages By PennyLynn Webb \\"Just make us look cool\\", is what John Jeffers Lead and Rhythm Guitarist of the band Whiskey Myers told me as we concluded an interview in my office. The irony is, I don't have to try to make them look cool, Whiskey Myers is the coolest Southern Rock band to hit the scene since the prime of The Allman Brothers, Credence Clearwater Revival and Lynyrd Skynyrd. Their music with its rich incendiary sound breaks through the barrier of time taking us back to when music made your soul feel free. For those of you who haven't been formally introduced, Whiskey Myers is the newest and brightest star of the Texas music scene. Lead singer Cody Cannon of Neches and Vocalist, Rhythm and Lead Guitarist Cody Tate of Grapeland met while working at Hibbits, a sporting goods store in Palestine. Cannon introduced Tate to his longtime friend John Jeffers of Palestine. Wanting to embark on becoming a band, in 2005 these guys began jamming at the homes of their friends and family, calling themselves \\"Lucky Southern\\". They were eventually joined by Cannon's cousin Gary Brown who plays Bass and long time friend Jeff Hogg on drums. When the group found out that there was already a band named \\"Lucky Southern\\" in existence, the name \\"Whiskey Myers\\"emerged and became their new calling card. Their humble beginnings in 2007 had them playing concerts for their friends and family on flatbed trailers. \\"They've since have made leaps and bounds in their career opening for Roger Creager, The Eli Young Band and The Randy Roger Band just to name a notable few. Now on the verge of signing a contract with Smith Entertainment, their first album is set to be released in stores on July 15, all the while readying themselves to lay down tracks on a second album. Lead singer Cody Cannon has a voice that could be likened to the sound of Gregg Allman lead singer of The Allman Brothers with a hint of Jon Bon Jovi and maybe a splash of lead singer of Guns n Roses, Axel Rose. Already seasoned for success, his voice is layered with wisdom well beyond his years. Cody Tate, who can give an on-spot impersonation of Billy Givens of ZZ Top, has this amazing gravely voice that is very alluring. John Jeffers and Gary Brown are no slouches when it comes to their vocal offerings. One of the truly amazing things about this group is that they've not had formal musical training. John Jeffers and Cody Tate learned their guitar skills from their fathers. Cody Cannon was taught by Jeffers' father. Their guitar prowess could be likened to that of the Counting Crows, the Marshall Tucker Band or Lynyrd Skynyrd. Both are adequately proficient with Lead and Rhythm Guitar, Jeffers and Tate exchange their roles throughout the concert, even during songs. Drummer Jeff Hogg is the only one who can read music. After learning to play the snare drum in band class, he taught himself how to play a drum set. And although Gary Brown has only been playing Bass for the past year, he effectively fills in the gaps. While these guys are wide eyed and euphoric, soaking up the experience of this wild and crazy ride, they remain grounded in the fact that they are not willing to cave into industry pressure. When asked if they would consider caving to industry pressure if the money was right, Tate answered, \\"It might change, but it won't be influenced. From the beginning to where you are ten years down the road, it's going to be different music, like it or not.\\" He continued with, \\"We're not trying to sound like anybody else. Were just trying to play what we love. Even if it's ten years from now we are going to play what we want to play.\\" When asked if they wanted to be famous, Cody Cannon replied, \\"Everybody wants to be famous. We're playing because we love it. This is all we've got, this is all we do.\\" John Jeffers followed with, \\"We want to be up there playing. We want to do it. We are dedicated to doing this. We don't have anything to fall back on. We don't necessarily want to be famous, but we do want to be successful. We're doing what we love and we hope to continue doing it.\\"<br />Their album is full of rock worthy songs that Southern Rock fans will want to listen to at full volume. Their fresh and in your face lyrics can be heard on \\"Summer 2005\\" the autobiographical song about how it all began, and \\"TYA\\", a song about a girl that is threatening to leave.<br />The band digs soulfully deeper with Russell's Song, an introspective song about the life of Cody Tate's childhood friend Russell Pennington who was struck by lighting. \\"American Outlaw\\", with it's wicked guitar intro, gives the listener the feeling of a front row seat to an old west gunslingers face off. Each song on the album has a sound uniquely it's own. While the sound on their CD Road of Life is a no holds barred spiritual offering to the altar of Southern Rock, the live resonance of this group is amazingly electrified as they feed off the energy of the crowd. At times they get so lost in the performance with a music high they forget the crowd is there. This group's sound and performance, even on a bad day, will out live your expectations. Not yet jaded by the attention of the crowd, they all profess a love of visiting with the crowd after their performances. If you haven't seen or heard of Whiskey Myers you can check them out at [...] or [...]n't necessarily want to be famous, but we do want to be successful.

B000LE1FAY|2.0|I give Belinda credit for the attempt but this attempt pales when compared to Tina Arena's venture into French-language recordings. Belinda's American accent lacks any charm or exotic appeal.  And her selection of French songs is pushing the envelope for francophone audiences.  Even many of France's top singers dare not revisit the songs of Piaf and Ferre as their versions are revered. This recording is not for anyone who understands the French language and its musical traditions!
B000056VJ7|5.0|I first got hooked on this album when I was barely a teenager and could listen to it over and over.  Now 30 yrs later I still occasionally enjoy listening to it.  I no longer listen to rock music as I didn't care for the path it took over the years and pretty well only listen to country music now a days but Bat out of Hell has a timeless quality about it that I think I will still enjoy it in another 30 yrs.  It is a great album in my opinion.

All in all an enjoyable array of 14 safe songs that don't challenge her vocal range so it's a little difficult to tell how good she really is. I'd love to see her perform live, she's definitely very easy on the eyes!
B00005K3O4|4.0|Ok this is the disclaimer:  For B movie lovers this is easily a 4 star film for the film lovers that want quality and enormous budgets it is a 2 star film.    Why the disclaimer because this movie is by far not a GREAT movie but is great at being ridiculous, laughable and completely over the top and like no movie ever made.          Aliens crash land on earth to collect humans for their inquenchable thirst of blood.  Soon the town is being told of the strange aliens that have landed and they are being described as Klowns.  It doesn't take long and the Klowns are in town creating havoc in a circus variety way.  Typical horror movie fair the resistance begins against these Klowns from another world.  You get the idea.          \\"B\\" movie lovers will have to have this as part of their collection because of the many gags that are pulled off in this film.  Such as wrapping people in cotton candy cocoons, drinking their blood with silly straws, shadow puppets that kill, pies in the face that kill you, and a space ship in the form of a circus tent.  These are just some of the many strange killing devices in this insane movie.    The more \\"normal\\"(I am the abnormal which love ridiculous cinema) movie lover may want to rent this first and see if it a film of their liking, because the plot is fluid but clowns killing people in zany ways may not be your ideal movie experience.  Normal movie fan you have been warned, but I do encourage everyone to see it at least once to say you have had the \\"experience\\".  B movie or campy classic lover BUY IT NOW for this price it needs to be in your librairy right next to Attack of the Killer Tomatoes and Gymkata.

For the witch, it's her heart.<br /><br />Stardust was completely entrancing, and charming and a surprisingly quick read. The star's spunk and Tristran's humanity are both to be admired in this adventurous tale that will make you laugh outloud and break into tears. Stardust is not to be missed.
B0017I1FNK|3.0|A few numbers are wonderfully sung.  For the most part, though, this is my least favorite of all her compliations.  There simply is something lacking.  Her voice is crisp and clear but the selections sound twangy and way to country hillbilly to be of note.
1416914293|5.0|The past few weeks have been hectic for Clary Fray to say the least, and they only seem to get even more so in the sequel to Cassandra Clare's popular debut City of Bones. Clary's mother still hasn't awoken from her strange sleep induced by Jace and Clary's father, Valentine, and Jace is having troubles coming to terms with his true parentage.     Things only get more complicated when an Inquisitor is sent to the Institute to question Jace's loyalty to the Clave, and he doesn't make a good impression. Suspicion is further aroused when children of magical descent are found dead all over the city, making everyone suspect that Valentine is up to something more sinister than they have anticipated.    The second book in the Mortal Instruments series is full of fast paced action and twists and turns that you won't see coming. Clary gets more and more involved in the supernatural world as she and Jace struggle to accept their relationship, while at the same time fending off attacks from all sides. In between it all is exhilarating excitement, the awkwardness of being a teenager, and intriguing mysteries. Readers looking for more breathless adventure and a spectacular battle against evil will delight in City of Ashes.

B00180R06I|5.0|It's time to replace your Image copy of VAMPYR with this stunning new release from Criterion.  My preordered copy actually arrived on the day of release, even with the free shipping option (thanks, Amazon!), and I watched the feature last night.<br /><br />While the version from Image is not unwatchable, the improvement that Criterion offers is major.  The image is still quite soft, but has been thoroughly cleaned up.  And the print they used either did not have all of those \\"punch holes\\" that the Image disc has, or they did an excellent job of filling them in.  The sound is also very much improved.  And gone are the ugly black rectangles containing the subtitles in an Old English-style font; the subtitles can be turned on and off, and they are in the typical kind of easy-to-read sans serif font you find on most DVDs.<br /><br />The Criterion release includes two versions of the film:  one with the intertitles and book text insert shots in German, the other with intertitles and book text insert shots in English.  Both have the dialogue in German, so subtitles are still needed when viewing the English text version (unless you're fluent in German, of course).  Dreyer reportedly made the film in English, French, and German versions (and also in Danish?--in one of the DVDs, can't remember which, the father writes his note on the wrapped-up book in Danish).  Sadly, the original English version of the film is no longer extant, at least not in a condition that is watchable.<br /><br />I have not yet delved into the supplemental materials, but they seem to be substantial.  The packaging is exquisite, and very appropriate to the feature.  The heavy paper slipcase holds a fold-out DVD case (illustrated with images from the film) containing the two discs and a thick booklet with several interesting articles.  Also in the slipcase is a paperbound book containing an English translation of the original screenplay and the original story \\"Carmilla\\" by J. Sheridan le Fanu.
B001B71NOI|5.0|First, I'd like to point out that all you whiners complaining that this is the same as Trent's other stuff are the same people that are the first to whine when your favorite band comes out with new stuff (that you don't like). You're also the same people that get all mad at concerts because they only play a couple of the older hits. STFU already!    This album is absolutely great. What's even more fantastic is what Trent is doing for the music world. Even if you don't like his music, you can't ignore his message.    In a world of pedantic, money-grubbing, music fan hating old farts that are the RIAA, Trent rises above and shows us where the real energy & effort should be spent - on catering to the fans of the music instead of suing them.    Trent doesn't EXPECT anyone to buy his album because he's released something new (again!). He gives (part of) it away as a free download, then creates something amazingly unique. His marketing techniques are pure genius.    I'm just one of many long-time NiN fans that have gone out of my way to purchase everything Trent has produced because of his attitude towards the music industry and RIAA.    We need more artists like Trent. If your favorite band still has the RIAA leash around their necks, DON'T buy the CD - the RIAA makes too much money from them, and the artist doesn't get squat. Go to the concerts, buy the merchandise, and urge them to go independent like Trent.    The only way we can fight the RIAA is to avoid them like a plague. They will eventually wither and die like the rotting old corpses that they are.
0743454529|5.0|I could not put the book down.  I had to find out what was going to happen next.  It really makes you stop and think about your own feelings on life and death. When do you consider the moment of life? Conception? After it is an embryo?  If you had to choose between harming one child to save another.  What would you do in the same situation?  Would you make the same choices?  We would all like to think we can make better decisions when the time comes.  Gripping and heartbreak.  A real page turner.  The only thing I did not like about the book is I felt a little betrayed by the author with the way the book ended.  Read for yourself.
1400079179|1.0|I found this book to be a complete waste of time,money and it was wrote in such a way  to let people think it was true by saying that all art work ,architect, religous acts are facts.When not one is and Every thing that stated as a fact in the book by Dan Brown and the characters is a completely fictional.<br /> And it was wrote mainly to attack christanity !
B0014Z4OQG|4.0|i loved this movie and saw it in the theater as soon as it came out. i think the lost camera thing helped make it very realistic and entertaining. the only part i didn't like was when they were at the party in the beginning and swinging the camera all around madly. it has some crashes, gore, sprinting down manhatten streets covered in glass and rubble in just bare feet. yes, they all die except lily,and people say that's depressing. so what? people die.<br /><br />  all in all, a good movie, though maybe not one you'd want to see with little kids or your grandparents.

If you want want you French movie experience to be all quaint streets, homely cafes, street markets and bagettes then enjoy all the cliches this fantasy has to offer.

B001B71NOI|4.0|Three and a half stars.  You know, I'm not going to bore you here with the story of \\"The Slip\\", being that I don't assume that Nine Inch Nails has many casual fans anymore, and anyone is interested knows that it is availble for free on the groups website. Rather, let's for go that whole discussion and move directly to the record itself.  Being prolific, apparently, is very good to Trent Reznor. After having to wait five years for 1999's \\"The Fragile\\", and six years for its insipid followup, 2005's \\"With Teeth\\", I didn't expect a new Nine Inch Nails record, going with their average pace, until 2010. But here we are in 2008, and Reznor has released three strong records in a row, with \\"Year Zero\\", the instrumental collection \\"Ghosts \\"I-IV\\", and his newest record, \\"The Slip\\".  It is true that there isn't a whole lot new here. The record utilizes the things that Reznor has been doing pretty much every since the beginning: hard rock/ industrial, with some ambient instrumental pieces and \\"ballads\\" thrown in for good reason. This record is also a logical progression from his last \\"with singing!\\" LP, \\"Year Zero\\", as it boasts a (for him) more minimalist production sound and emphasis on big beats.  But you know what? For an artist who has been recording for almost twenty years, Reznor and his defacto project, Nine Inch Nails, can be forgiven for not reinvinting the wheel. The man never sounds bored on \\"The Slip\\", rather providing new colors for his already trademark sound.  \\"The Slip\\" starts off with a short ambient piece before launching into \\"1,000,000\\", a propulsive, driving song that sets the tone for the first half of the record. \\"Letting You\\" follows suit, all punchy drums and loud guitars crashing together with more enthusiasm than many of Reznor's peers and followers can put into an entire record. \\"Discipline\\" is flat out the funkiest song the man has ever commited to tape, going back to the disco-esque hi-hat work from his biggest hit, \\"Closer\\", with a bass line as tight and fluid as anything he has committed to tape (or, computer hard drive, as it were). \\"Echoplex\\" isn't as hard hitting as the earlier songs, but is still Nine Inch Nails rock, patented 1992.  On side B of the record, Reznor slips into his more subdued material. The instrumentals that adorn this part of the record are reminscent to what the man did with \\"Ghosts\\", and the ballad like \\"Lights in the Sky\\" has a tossed off feel that compliments the song perfectly, sounding vaguely like something off of \\"Still\\", the bonus disc that came with his live record, \\"And All That Could Have Been\\".  Now, I know I used a lot of references there to Nine Inch Nails earlier catalog. Again, \\"The Slip\\" is a piece of that catalog, and it's actually kind of comforting to hear Reznor hitting a groove. \\"The Slip\\" is also Reznor's most consolidated record since his debut, having just ten tracks and running under fifty minutes long. There is no overarching concept here, just a tight record, something new for Reznor.  Now, the cons. Reznor still remains a fairly terrible lyricist. The man continues to write like a fifteen year old dissed by a girl in high school, all pent up rage at nothing in particular. His words continue to be a drag, and where \\"Year Zero\\" at least saw him trying to grow out of it and look at something outside of himself, here, once again, he points the finger right at Reznor, and doesn't come up with anything interesting to say.  Also, the sequencing is flawed. By putting all the rockers at the beginning and the ambient stuff at the end, it hurts any sort of flow that could have been accomplished by mixing it up, spreading it out, the record would have a stronger impact than it does.  \\"The Slip\\" is not the great Nine Inch Nails record. But it is a strong album from Reznor and crew, a worthy addition to their canon, and one that is worth adding to your MP3 library.  NOTE ON PHYSICAL EDITION: This edition comes with a 24 page booklet, digipack foldout, a bonus DVD thatfeatures the band playing five of the songs live in rehersals, and a nifty sticker pack for everyone's lunchboxes.
B0011FXLCC|5.0|I've listened to this CD over and over... I can't stop. It's pure perfection as far as I am concerned. It's the best CD I've heard in quite some time. So, bought it in San Francisco and listened to it there. Just now put it into my car CD rotation. I need more time to provide a respectable review, but I had to submit my five star review to help contribute to the overall rating for this CD. Upon the first few listens, I was immediately reminded of Cocteau Twins... that seems like a very kind comparison!! I'm not too familiar with older Goldfrapp. I am not one that is a fan of the two CDs between Felt Mountain and Seventh Tree, not because I don't like the music, I just haven't had the opportunity to listen closely.  I am listening closely to Seventh Tree. I really love it... enough to write this rather pitiful review. I guess sometimes great music leaves one speechless. This CD is Joyous and I love it!
0061537934|5.0|Most people are saying, if you're a dog lover, you will love this book. Do NOT miss out reading or recommending this story by limiting it to only dog lovers or racing fans. I have no dogs and know little of racing. This book transcends both! It will also make you a fan of both. Garth Stein has written a wonderful book about a great character, a dog named Enzo, whom I came to love and hang on his every thought. Enzo has a better grasp of life than most people do, even if ironically, he wants to be a human. There are life lessons here that will stay with you and put a smile on your face and in your heart as you learn about living for today and how we choose to live today. You will be wondering about a couple of things, what am I manifesting in my life to bring joy into it and, what the heck is my dog or cat thinking anyway?? This is a wonderfully inspiring and entertaining book. Two barks for Enzo! And FIVE stars for Garth Stein for a most delightful reading EXPERIENCE .
B00006LI4S|5.0|The beginning of the DVD I first thought a little odd, it seemed like Gilmour was doing a sound check. But it quickly turned into Shine On You Crazy Diamond. He performed many of the classic Pink Floyd tunes and even though I was skeptical that I would like a lot of them played on an acoustic guitar, I enjoyed the whole show tremendously.<br /><br />Unlike when Clapton turned Layla into an acoustic version that had little resemblance to the legendary version, Gilmour's acoustic interpretation is very similar to the recorded versions. He does pickup an electric guitar -- a Gretsch -- from time to time and it's every bit as good as it used to be.<br /><br />David's voice isn't quite what it used to be, but he's not as young either like a lot of us fans. I didn't find it detracting from the entertainment and motivational value as guitar player.<br /><br />I highly recommend this video to any Pink Floyd/David Gilmour fan. I think you'll find it well worth the price.
B000EWBKKI|5.0|With VHS there was always a fairly visible vapor that affected the film.  With DVD we saw a new image.  With Blu-Ray the vapor is eliminated, and the image is heightened to the point that you can see every flaw.  This is the case with most older films that are given the High Def treatment.  Terminator 1 and 2 are no different.  Please watch Independence Day and tell me that ever effect is goofy looking in HD.  The fact is our films under HD are starting to look like those old black and white sci-fi movies we told our parents looked like crap, and we doubted out they could ever fear the Creature From the Black Lagoon.    I, however, am a realist.  I get quite excite when I watch a Blu-Ray and can see the flaws.  From dirty windows in the Bourne Series, to the Jittery movement of the De-Swartzenegger'd Terminator.  T-1000s special effects were amazing originally, but now, almost 20 year later, it looks... well, matted.  Because let's face it... they are.    Blu-Ray is going to age your films.  Allowing us to see every inch of the movie, all 1080 of it, and is going to also show blemishes, bumps, bruises, and might open the door to a more romanesque interpretation of the artform, instead of the Athenian idealism that preceeded this age.  The reason why this statement is fact is that the entertainment industry is shuffling as we speak to design make-up that is HD safe.    My hope is that it is not.  All our favorite films are flawed.  I mean, after all, T1 and T2 do not star the great actor of all time.  Let's face it.  The name at the front of the credits is the first flaw.    All the same, I love my copy.  I can't wait to see a true HD movie like Terminator Salvation.  The robots are majorly going to kick butt.
B000EJ9MTW|4.0|This is a young new band, but could have fit right in the era of Woodstock.  This is defiantly retro rock that will remind one of Zeppelin, Deep Purple, Ten Years After, Blue Cheer, Hendrix, Sabbath and a host of other hard rock bands from the end of the 60's early 70's.  Your take on this retro sound will vary, but these kids do what they do really well.  Vocalist Andrew Stockdale certainly has Robert Plant as an influence and the band crank out heavy guitar riffs, along with the occasional organ and flute solo just like their forefathers did all those years ago.  The album got a lot of attention with the hit single \\"Woman\\" which I have to admit is catchy as hell and it fits in with the material on the rest of the album.  There is even some Beatles - ish stuff and songs like \\"Tales\\" that sounds like fellow retro rockers Jet.  Overall I think this is a really cool album and I get a lot of enjoyment out of it.  Nice to see some young rockers that aren't afraid to play a solo now and then.  Yea, some of the lyrics are less than clever, but the band makes up for it with sheer enthusiasm.  These guys are definitely worth checking out.
B00009V7PJ|5.0|Fantastic. This DVD should be owned by everyone. She puts on a dynamic and exciting show.
0743290119|1.0|This novel really nowhere.  There was little plot, and the characters were one-dimensional. Insipid drivel.
1604591625|5.0|Chesterton is hard to take at times; his irritating metaphors and play on words can grind one down.  But, what is extraordinary is that this book is so relevant to the \\"now\\".  He has grasped the nettle of modern relativism and said: \\"no, accipio crucem Christi; I believe in the Trintiy of princely might\\": \\"it is utterely rational for me to so believe\\".  A definite \\"must\\" for anyone who wishes to deal with the issues of modernity and faith.
386521584X|5.0|This is one of the classic photographic books. I suggest that anyone with a hobby or serious interest in photography read this book.
0141806699|5.0|This is a very funny book, and its evocation of life in the English Midlands is comically well-observed.    Underlying the humour though, is a story of tragedy and survival in a time of genocide.    The eighty-something father who is seduced by a thirty-something Ukranian woman (with \\"most superior breasts\\"!) is sympathetically drawn despite his obvious flaws, and his occasional rambling monologues on politics & philosophy are genuinely informative.    The antagonism and eventual raprochement between the two sisters is funny, touching and totally believable.    All the characters are well-drawn.    I strongly recommend this great book.
0071592466|5.0|The phrases really helped me prepare for the speaking and writing sections.  Actually, they've helped my English overall.  A very clever, helpful book.
B00139W3NE|4.0|I hadn't read the novel before the movie, so I enjoyed the condensed version on screen, but my teenaged son lamented that so many parts had been left out from the book. It's nearly impossible to capture the full spirit and flavor of a book, or include all the chapters and details in the movie version, but this tale has plenty of great fantasy fiction and I found it very entertaining. A young girl with a good heart has her determination fully tested when she attempts to rescue her kidnapped friends. It was left just a little 'opened-ended' to make room for a sequel, but not in a way that leaves the viewer frustrated.<br /><br />Chrissy K. McVay - Author
015626224X|5.0|Orwell began as an idealist and remained one until his untimely death at the age of 48 from tuberculosis. In most of the photographs I can find of the great writer, he always has a smoke in his mouth, typing away, while a white haze of thoughts, ideas, nicotine and tar surround him, like a dangerous muse.<br /><br />Eric Blair or Orwell was of the writing school of thought that in order to write with authenticity, the writer must have experienced the emotion, relationship or event in some way. Many writers at the time were of the same persuasion; Hemmingway is the first that comes to mind...Jack London too, particularly his early work.<br /><br />In Down and Out in Paris and London, the young writer sets out, a middle class Englishman, to find and work any manual labour job that he could find to eventually land one in Paris as a 'dogs body' -diswasher, cleaner, et al. He is paid very little and (most importantly) fed for his gruelling 14 hour shifts.<br /><br />Though this was a great opportunity, as a writer, searching out material, this was the place to be...the characters' in the book are priceless.<br /><br />One of the more memorable descriptions:<br /><br />\\"In the kitchen the dirt was worse. It is not a figure of speech, it is a mere statement of fact to say that a French cook will spit in the soup - that is if he is not going to drink it himself.\\"<br /><br />This not to say this happends now in the twenty-first century, but this is only an observation from the author at the time - some eighty years ago.<br /><br />This is early work from Orwell - an apprentice, so to speak, learning his trade.<br /><br />Interestingly, next to [[ASIN:0452284236 Nineteen Eighty-Four]] and [[ASIN:0452284244 Animal Farm: Centennial Edition]] Down and Out is one of his best endevours.<br /><br />In this book or as most say, Diary, the reader will recognize Orwell's gift for characterization.<br /><br />Worth a look at.
081541028X|5.0|My father gave me his copy of CARRYING THE FIRE in 1975 when I was eleven.  His recommendations were rare, so I knew the book was special--I was not disappointed. Mike's narrative is beautifully delivered, poignant and funny as hell.  This is a personal account that lets the reader enter the world of Apollo from Mike's point of view.  The complexities of the Apollo 11 mission (and spaceflight in general) are presented in a flowing, readable style--you won't want  to put this book down.  Reading it again after all these years, I enjoyed the experience even more.  He was a young man on that flight, but his insight, intelligence and humor reveal him to be a deep thinking, passionate, brave  human being who helped change the history of mankind forever. As a high school English teacher, I can honestly say that this book is more than a good read, it is a must read for anyone interested in knowing what it was like to fly to the moon on the adventure of a lifetime! FIVE STARS--read it!
630529142X|5.0|This is my favorite of all of Sandler's movies.  It is among one of the few movies that I cannot count how many times I've seen.  I could never grow tired of watching this movie!  If you like movies that are just plain FUNNY you'll love this movie.  Kathy Bates did an excellent Mama.  There are a few lines that will stick with you, and if you are like me years later will still laugh hard every time you hear them.  \\"You can do it!\\" is my favorite.  Sandler's character is simple, sweet, and lovable.  Mama is more multi-dimensional than I expected her to be the first time I watched the movie.  His girlfriend would seem like the worst match on Earth for him, but they make a great comedy compliment to each other well.  The coach is another lovable character.  You'll be rooting for the good guys and laughing like you haven't laughed in years (or since the last time you watched Waterboy).
1401322336|4.0|I like this book tremendously.  I'm somewhat of a collector of cookbooks and this is one of my favorites.  It has full color pictures of all the recipes, which work with precision every time.  (I've already had three people ask me for the Shortbread recipe and I've only had this book a month or so.)  I also enjoyed Jamie's tips, such as shaking salad dressings in a jar to emulsify instead of whisking.  The attached ribbon bookmark is handy too.  One of the main things that I like is that it doesn't take 30 ingredients to make one of the recipes.  It's broken down to the basics and the flavors really exhibit themselves.  The sections are broken down well into categories such as Fish, Pasta, Custard, etc.  There are a few negatives that I've found with this book however.  Firstly, Jamie Oliver seems to promote his devices and other books a bit too much for my taste.  Secondly, the pages are thin and seem very fragile when splattered with water.  Lastly, and perhaps it's an English thing, but he seems to use terms such as \\"a pinch\\", \\"a slight cup\\", and \\"a dash\\" quite a bit.  I'd much rather have precision.  Overall a very knowledgeable, refreshing read.
B0000683WG|5.0|Why didn't I get this beauty in 72?   Well probably because it took me about 2  months to save for an album and I was busy buying everything Slade I could find. Hey I Still think they were great too..   I remember holding the 'Slider\\" sleeve and as I was about to take it to the counter having second thoughts (fool!)   All these years later I finally own the thing and guess what it's bloody marvellous.   The lyrics are pseudo intellectual meaningless twaddle in other words they work in rock n' roll! (Be-Bop A Lula, I was born in a cross fire hurricane even a few Dylan's, come on!)   These songs fill the breach between pop and rock wonderfully. The rock song are based on the best possible templates Chuck Berry, Gene Vincent, Eddie Cochran etc.. the ballads frame the boogie nicely. The production is HUGE take a bow Tony Visconti! (hey this IS glam after all).  So get this if you want a really exciting album that is heaps of fun yet really rocks and doesn't sound dated at all this is pretty hard to beat. And after that get 'Electric Warrior' and then...
B0000AC8N4|5.0|There is a lot to like about this CD. Recorded in Paris with Kenny Clarke and Pierre Michelot as the rhythm section, this captures a flavor and sound of jazz that, while certainly not uncommon, was starting to lose its influence thanks to John Coltrane redefining the concept of saxophone jazz. But this recording takes things back to the roots of saxophone jazz, with the first six tracks of this recording being completely unapologetic about featuring virtually nothing but Gordon's lively, full tone sax, both to lay down the melody and then to pick up the solos. The effect is that you get a LOT of saxophone, and it is recorded very \\"hot\\", so the vibrancy and richness of Gordon's tenor comes right out and stomps on everything. I'm not much of a jazz historian (yet), but to me, this is sort of the definitive jazz saxophone music and sound that I expect from a saxphone player. Which is not to say that the sax rules all else, because in addition to the aforementioned rhythm section, you have the always exciting Bud Powell on piano. And what really makes this CD for me is that unlike Bud Powell's own recordings, this one is not riddled with hiss and pops and other noise. You still get Bud muttering and singing here and there (which never bothered me that much), but with Rudy Van Gelder's (always reliable) remastering, the instruments are equalized just right, leaving Dexter's sax out front and Bud's piano in the back, that way it should be. Until, that is, you get to track seven, \\"Like Someone in Love\\", which starts off and ends up with Bud Powell soloing on piano, and lets him lead the way through the song. Again, for me, this is perfect, because just when I think I've had about enough of the sax, Gordon sits out the majority of the song so the incredible and fascinating lyricism that Powell creates on the piano becomes the exclamation point to the session. I don't give five stars casually, but I don't see how I can give this anything less than the highest possible rating. It's a fantastic piece of jazz music that belongs in the collection of all jazz fans, sax fans, and Gordon fans. It would also make a good choice for broadening a musical collection that is not jazz oriented, as it is very approachable and does not require a \\"jazz ear\\" to enjoy. Highly recommended..

B000ZN802W|5.0|Into the Wild will not be to everyone's liking.  Some people will dislike the protagonist, Christopher McCandless, and others will find the movie's pacing to be slow.  Yet, I was fascinated by and even a little envious of Chris's dogged attempt to find meaning in life and his disregard for other people's expectations.  Like the ascetic monks who would wander into the desert to find enlightenment, Chris was determined to find the answers to spiritual questions by renouncing all worldly things and, ultimately, all contact with other people.    Jaded by the shallowness of America's consumer culture and the poisonous dynamics of family life as he grew up, and inspired by writers like Tolstoy, Thoreau, and London who praised simplicity and being connected to nature, Chris decides after graduating from Emory University to give away his money, break off all contact with his wealthy family, and take off on the mother of all road trips.  He does not get far before his car is damaged in flash flooding, so he abandons the automobile and makes the remainder of his journey by walking, canoeing, hitchhiking, or sneaking onto freight trains.  Chris travels to various places in America and Mexico and plunges into new experiences, new friendships, and a new romance.  Drawing him onward is the lure of his \\"great Alaska adventure\\" in which he would live alone in Alaska's big sky country.  Along his circuitous route to Alaska, he breaks the hearts of many people he leaves behind, including a lonely old man, Ron Franz (played by Hal Holbrook, in a touching performance), who offers to adopt him.  Although Chris shows his fondness for Ron, Chris keeps him at a safe emotional distance by saying that happiness cannot be found in human relationships.    [SPOILER ALERT]  After Chris at last makes his way into the Alaskan backcountry in April, he makes a series of mistakes (not properly preserving his wild game and eating poisonous berries) that bring him to the brink of death.  At last experiencing the most profound type of solitude--that of an isolated person confronting his imminent end--Chris concludes that a happy life is one shared with others, not one spent alone.  The viewer is left to ponder the question of whether, if Chris had recovered, he truly would have reintegrated into society or whether the \\"call of the wild\\" would have led him back onto his solitary path.  In other words, even if Chris did not want to die alone, it's unclear whether he would have wanted to live alone.    Raising perennial questions about whether society improves or spoils its members, whether happiness is found in social settings or in confronting nature alone, whether a person should live by uncompromising ideals or should make his peace with society's numerous and serious flaws, whether someone who so completely rejects society's shared ideals is a genius or a madman, and whether Chris was running away from his problems or engaging in a necessarily private spiritual quest, Into the Wild gives the thoughtful viewer much to think about.  Yet, the movie also engages the viewers' emotions by showing Chris's desperate yearning for a pure and intensely lived life and the fragile and combustible dynamics of human relationships.  For viewers who are more interested in a mature and contemplative film, Into the Wild is highly recommended.
0553381687|2.0|This book had an interesting idea in that it attempted to tell a story through the viewpoints of multiple characters. This is a good idea in theory (something more original for a fantasy novel) except that half of the characters it tells the story through are uninteresting and are really more a waste of time than anything else. If you don't like some of the characters, the chapters that focus on them become torturous and painful to read. There are whole chapters in this book that could be omitted completely and probably should have been for the sake wasting the reader's time.<br /> The storyline has many plots and subplots as have been mentioned in other reviews but the overall guiding storyline is predictable and any twists it introduces are pretty plain. There are a few exciting high points that should have been focused more on but were lost quickly by the dense amount of seemingly useless subplots taking place at the same time.<br /> I had high hopes for this book when I first picked it up but it was ultimately very disappointing in the end. When the book finishes, it eludes to something much bigger going on. But I can't bring myself to continue with this series because this book is 800 pages long but should have been cut to half that many to tell the mediocre story it does. Just plain slow
B001B71NOI|5.0|I think this is a very solid album, even more so than Year Zero. Old school NIN fans will find plenty to like here. There are nods to all the old albums, but more than anything this is a return to roots for Reznor.  Unlike the experimental/noise concept album that was Year Zero, this record feels more like a mix of Downward Spiral and the more recent With Teeth. Overall, it's a great album.
006135323X|1.0|this book has some interesting theories but they are overshadowed by the left leaning social/political commentary. I thought I bought a book on marketing experiments and not to be lectured on how government is the best answer to societies problems because people are too stupid. This man has obviously not lived in the real world only the academic world. Too bad because he has an inquisitive mind but it has been muddled by his environment.
0452289963|4.0|I ordered this by accident and was prepared to snark and sneer; however, I was pleasantly surprised that I read it in a couple of sittings and took away something of value. No, it doesn't reflect my belief system.  No, it isn't particularly original.  Yes, it can be viewed as popularized and diluted Eastern thought.  However, as one who spends about 90% of life in her head, I need constant reminders to come to my senses (literally).  Tolle does a nice of reminding me of this and gives some specific and useful tips as to how to achieve and maintain awareness.    I am a bit mystified by the perception that a single, childless man may not be credible as a writer on enlightenment.  So we need to hold out for the mystical musings of the Old Woman Who Lived in a Shoe?
B000006N7A|5.0|This is only one of the best OP Trio CD. A trio that sounds like an orchestra. My favourite track is \\"You Look Good to Me\\". Ray Brown bass is fantastic as always. A must have in every jazz lover collection.  I am one of the requesters!
6302186161|5.0|Great value and the set was in mint condition. Fast action on sellers part.  Thank you
B000002UA5|4.0|Okay, its one of their worsts, actually the worst, but I still rated it 4 stars.      The Live portion is good, it has one song from Piper at the Gates of Dawn, 2 songs from A Saucerful of Secrets, and a single I had never heard before.  A good 1st disc.    The second disc is a studio album.  Let me start by saying that I am a pianist and love Rick Wright, that being said the first 4 songs are by him and they are...odd.  Good piano playing however.    The next 2 songs are by Roger Waters.  I am surprised that whatever drugs he was taking in order to make these songs didn't kill him, these songs were downright weird.  I was laughing so hard at one of them I could not stop.  I really like ALL of Roger Waters other music with Pink Floyd though.  The next 3 are David Gilmour's.  These are really good.  Really...these alone make up for the first 6.    The last 3 are Nick Mason's and are excellent.  It showcases his greatness (don't know if that is a word) and has some flutes also?  While they not as good as Moby Dick-Led Zeppelin with John Bonham, its still good.      All in All it is a CD that is worth getting, just don't expect songs like Let there be Light or Time.   And Pink Floyd is hands down the best band EVER.

B0010X745K|1.0|This movie was terrible. I wasn't even mid-way through the show when I started to realize this flick just wasn't going to get any better.     The dialogue was bad. The characters were annoying. The effects . . . laughable. Seriously, I started cracking up during that tentacle scene because it reminded me so much of those old movies where the actual creature is never shown but you always get a glimpse of a piece of its body. And then the scenes in the movie that did fully show other creatures looked like scenes that were rip-offs from Aliens, Arachnophobia, War of the Worlds, and Eight Legged Freaks.     And that bible toting, end of days preaching, Jim Jones wannabe character  was soo grating on the nerves it was like sitting for almost two hours listening to someone drag their nails across a chalk board.    As for the ending, it simply left much to be desired. It wasn't merely bad because it ended on an unhappy note. I have seen movies that ended tragically but it fit perfectly for that movie.  This ending was out of left field and just left me with the feeling of 'what the . . . where did they come up with that idea?'    This was truly one of the worst horror movies I have ever seen and I could never recommend it to anyone.
B000F3T3CS|5.0|This is one of the finest opera DVDs it has ever been my pleasure to watch...now, that may be because I prefer laughing to crying, but I've given five stars to tear jerkers, too. This is Opera Buffa in all its glory...we come to have fun, not to ponder the meaning of life. Sometimes this can degenerate into slapstick, but these wonderful performers never did, even when Anna broke character to applaud Villazon's juggling act...yes, she broke character...look at her face....Villazon breaks character, too, but that was necessary to coordinate the encore of \\"una furtiva lagrima\\" with Maestro Eschwe. [And what an encore]!<br /><br />Every one of the principals was perfectly cast, and in fine form. Rolando Villazon is all we have come to expect as the hapless Nemorino...we could almost believe he's the local fool. Anna Netrebko is absolutely delectable...she does everything well, and it's nice to see her live to the end of the show. Her comic by-play with all the other characters is flawless. Leo Nucci as the lustful Sgt. Belcore is an old pro...we've cried for Rigoletto, sympathized with Germont, and wanted to knife Scarpia ourselves; well, he can make us laugh, too....the old fool chasing the young girl has to be done just right, or he's not funny...Nucci is hilarious...and now.....<br /><br />...a word about the REAL star; Ildebrando D'Archangelo as the quack Dr. Dulcamara carries the show. Perfect casting...flawlessly performed comedy. Nowhere is it written that the basso buffo has to be fat, and old. If Maestro D'Archangelo doesn't have quite the voice of the late, great, Salvatore Baccaloni, he still makes us believe, and makes us laugh. He has to move the plot line thru his interaction with the other characters, and he NEVER misses a beat...his dance scene with Anna is almost slapstick, but doesn't cross the line [nor does his sale of a bottle to the prompter].<br /><br />This DVD is a treasure...great singing, and a rollicking good time. If you only go to the opera to be sad, forget it. But, if you like to laugh, don't miss this wonderful performance.But, if you like to laugh, don't miss this wonderful performance.

It was one of those books that you can't stop reading no matter how much other stuff you need to do.  It can all wait because you have to know what happens.  I would highly recommend this book.  Great Read!
B0016Q56C4|3.0|Professor Trevor Anderson (Fraser) believes that the tale told by Jules Verne in \\"Journey to the Center of the Earth\\" is a true story.  When the opportunity arises, he, his nephew Sean (Hutcherson), and guide Hannah (Briem) set out on the path in Iceland set forth in the book.  Misfortune sends them down a tunnel to the center of the Earth, where the find a world of man-eating plants and dinosaurs.  Soon, the rising heat of the underworld necessitates that they find an escape route before being burned up.  Along the way, Trevor and Sean, who aren't close, develop a bond, and Trevor and Hannah feel sparks begin to fly.<br /><br />\\"Journey\\" is the first live-action film to use the new 3-D technology that has been used for animated films.  In fact, the movie is just an excuse to show off what can be accomplished in 3-D now.  The story is thin and the acting is not strong.  But, the film sure does look nice.  The 3-D is crisp and clear.  If this is a movie you want to see, be sure to see the 3-D version, and not the 2-D version.  Young kids will most like be the most entertained here.
0393324818|3.0|The problem with giving a Michael Lewis book five stars is that there is much better stuff out there. Lewis can be entertaining, and, to give credit, he hits out of the park in his choice of topic here. But he's an arrogant writer, with something of the \\"brilliant\\" graduate student after a couple of drinks about him, prone to sermonizing way off topic. He even did this in his first book, Liar's Poker, when he abruptly dropped his fascinating first person account to digress into the history of Salomon in the 1970s. Here - ditto. All the stuff on the A's and Beane is great. However there are way too long digressions into Bill James and the history of stats in baseball, which had me turning pages. Lewis is also fairly repetitive - this book is at least 90pages too long. If you want to read a great, great writer talking sports, try Tom Wolfe's powerhouse short story The Last American Hero, on Junior Johnson and the beginnings of NASCAR, found in his collection The Kandy Kolored Tangerine-Flake. Wolfe is a genuis and can say more in 45pages than Lewis manages here with just under 300.
B000088E77|5.0|Ok, it is a product of the 80's but still can be listened to today because of its reggae influences. The global sucess of Down Under as THE marketing anthem for Oz does the rest of this album a dis-service, with the most well known tracks being amongst the weakest. I once sat on a beach and watched the sun go down listening to Catch a Star and Down by the Sea on a ( cassette tape!) walkman, and it was one of the most perfect moments ever. If you have access to a beach and a sunset, try it, if you dont, dont let it stop you listening to this gem.
0938045695|2.0|Okay, the information contained in this book is incomplete, and can be resumed in just a few pages. It is overpriced.     Yeah, I know lots of people praise Enter the Kettlebell, and I don't dispute that it contains basic knowledge about form, posture, and fundamental moves, but it stays there. It is not THAT special as others say. It us supposedly sold as something that will \\"make you a man\\" and yadda yadda yadda. Ok, you have a few routines to get stronger, and I know they are very helpful, but for what you pay, and coming from Pavel, AT LEAST it should have en easy format about how to make your own routines, more movements, and suggestions for keeping the exercises for life, implementing new variations so you can never get bored. But this book doesn't deliver it.    I believe the reason for the little information is purely commercial. Inside the book, though there is some nice stuff, you find \\"suggestions\\" to keep going with other products from the author or company, and even the part about diet, Pavel just says \\"I use the Warrior Diet\\", a book from the same company. Then, if you post questions about the product in their site, usually they suggest you to recieve a course with a specialized trainer, more $$$ just to learn how to make your own workouts.     It's a shame, because kettlebells are really a very nice tool that can completely substitute a gym, but you have to look HARD around to get sincere information. There are much better DVDs and books, CHEAPER. For example, the excellent material from more genuine people like Anthony Diluglio, Lisa Shaffer and others, that offer \\"do it now\\" information with ideas of how to use many exercises and knowledge to use your kettlebells at home without needing to spend tons of money on more products.    Those are my two cents. Keep looking out there. On the positive, I'm glad more and more KB trainers and materials are being born every day, because that gives us many options to us, so we don't have to rely on the same guyalways.
B00000DR8R|5.0|Dont you hate it when everyone else says in their reviews what you are thinking? But its true! Now, I dont know about you but in my minds eye, an album from 24 years ago should be by the Beatles or the Doors or something, I mean 24 years!! There are women on the telly I find attractive that weren't born when I bought this album. Sigh. Yes, its all true. This is perfection, this is one of \\"those\\" albums (mental note, must make a list). It sounds like it could have been recorded last week, the songs are busker friendly guitar strummers. And it is just so great. I mean note perfect. How many times have you bought an album on the strength of a single or a review and found it contains 4 good tracks, 3 ok ones and 5 fillers? On Rattlesnakes, the great songs keep on coming and coming. Look, if you have heard it, you wont need me to tell you this, if you have not, what are you wasting your time for reading this? Just go and buy it. Just one more reason, this album has magic powers. Once in a pub in rural Shropshire in 1990, I said to a girl at the bar \\"You`ve got cheekbones like geometry\\" and she replied, \\"And Im sexually enlightened by Cosmopolitan.\\" And it turned out she was! Thats how good this album is. Try doing that with Silent Alarm by Bloc Party!
0345495004|5.0|Not only has the work of architect Frank Lloyd Wright been the subject of intense scrutiny but also his colorful personal life, in particular, the failure of his first two marriages and the deliberate acts of arson and murder at his Taliesin studio in 1914. First-time novelist Nancy Horan has captured just one extended episode in Wright's long, checkered life and written a terrifically engaging piece of historical fiction. Set in the years before World War I, it is fundamentally a love story between the married Wright and the wife of a client for whom he was designing one of his signature prairie houses in Oak Park. The woman was a real figure long forgotten, and her name was Mamah Borthwick Cheney. Their affair scandalized Chicago society, as both abruptly left their spouses and children in 1909 to live in Europe together. She more than he faced the judgment of an unforgiving public, and in response, she was racked with guilt. The irony is that Mamah's husband Edwin Cheney fully accepted the situation and granted her a divorce with unencumbered access to their children.<br /><br />Wright, on the other hand, faced resistance from his wife Catherine who adamantly refused to divorce him. Horan handles all this potentially sensationalistic material with a minimum of melodramatic flourish, and the story evolves into the personal journey of a couple who realize they have reached a point of no return. Their co-existence becomes so insulated from the outside world that they start to view themselves as idealists who rationalize their illicit actions through dedication to their individual endeavors. Wright's career, as we all know, continues to thrive thanks to his innate brilliance, while Mamah finds the precursor to a life coach in Swedish suffragist Ellen Key. Key's proto-feminist rhetoric about the constrictions of marriage sparks Mamah to embrace her mentor's singular belief that true love trumps quotidian obligation. The couple eventually returns to America where Wright builds his famous summer home in Wisconsin, Taliesin, in the hope of shielding themselves from censure. This is where Horan lets the drama of the actual events unfold and propel the narrative.<br /><br />It turns out that Key influenced Taliesin and also went through a personal transformation that allowed her to reverse her steadfast position and become a champion of motherhood. As the more elliptical figure, Mamah undergoes her own personal metamorphosis, which feels surprisingly contemporary in that author's approach. Without conveying any of her own personal judgment, Horan dares to expose a woman who made the socially unacceptable decision of allowing her self-expression take priority over her obligations as a mother. The problem Key tried to articulate in her philosophy could not be realized by Mamah without a major sacrifice, and there hasn't been that significant change in thinking a century later. Above all else, Horan is able to provide human dimension to the relationship between the lovers that touches on their own passions with unforced ease. Her book may not have the scope of E.L. Doctorow's [[ASIN:0812978188 Ragtime]] or even Erik Larson's [[ASIN:0375725601 The Devil in the White City:  Murder, Magic, and Madness at the Fair that Changed America]], two panoramic pieces of historical fiction set at the beginning of the 20th century, but I think she matches them in the vividness of the detail presented and in the immediacy of the characters' emotions.his famous summer home in Wisconsin, Taliesin, in the hope of shielding themselves from censure.

B00005JPY0|5.0|First of all, this is a GREAT film, not just a great Batman film.     Others have compared Christopher Nolan's two Batman films to the Tim Burton Batman films, so I won't repeat their observations.  Let me simply say that everything about this movie, from the script to the casting to the CGI to the acting and ultimately the directing is superb.     Now to Plato.  The meta-message of The Dark Knight is a meditation on the nature of good and evil, the veneer of civilization, the virtues of principle and the necessity and the danger of bending principle in emergencies, the differences between evil for gain or power and evil for mere destruction and chaos, and the tension between public duty and private loyalty.  Finally there is the question of the place for facts and the place for \\"sacred\\" myth.    (Caution: this review refers to specific scenes and characters.)    The mafia in Gotham is evil for gain and power.  They want money and they want influence.  They also want order.  When the manager of the bank objects to the robbery he complains that the usual rules and courtesies among criminals are being violated.  The corrupt police officers are evil for gain as well.  They too need general acceptance of rules and procedures.      The Joker is evil for evil's sake.  He sows chaos and disorder and wants to expose the thin veneer of civilization.  He seeks only to unmask what he sees as contradiction and hypocrisy in human nature and to demonstrate that so-called good citizens are really evil underneath.    Scarecrow, who was featured in Batman Begins and has a minor role in the drug bust scene in The Dark Knight, is a deranged psychiatrist whose evil comes from desire for power over others as he uncovers the weaknesses in the minds of others.    The Mayor is out for power but does not resort to evil.  Police Lieutenant James Gordon represents incorruptible good.  This is ultimately stressed when Gordon must make a choice between public duty and personal relationship.  Batman faces that same dilemma when he must decide whether to rescue Harvey Dent or Rachel Dawes.  Likewise, the passengers in the ferries must choose between what they are told will be personal survival and the deaths of others, in another of The Joker's nefarious experiments.  When the Wayne Industries accountant is about to reveal the identity of Batman, The Joker announces that the accountant must die, and citizens try to assassinate him.  Personal safety trumps adherence to the good sometimes, but not all times.      Batman seems weaker than The Joker because he adheres to rules.  The Biblical injunction, \\"Justice, justice shall you pursue,\\" has been understood as demanding that justice be pursued justly.  Evil, especially evil for its own sake, makes no such demand.  We see this every time terrorists deliberately target innocents and hide themselves behind children knowing that those in pursuit will not purposely aim at innocent bystanders.  This gives evil a huge temporary advantage.    Yet sometimes the good must bend and even break the rules.  Abraham Lincoln suspended the right of habeas corpus during a critical interval during the Civil War.  Batman asks Lucius Fox to preside over such a broken rule to locate and catch The Joker.  When and how can we know when good can break rules to catch evil?  Batman answers by creating a mechanism to restore the rules as soon as the crisis is over.      Alfred Pennyworth indirectly poses the question, \\"Knowing that evil, if attacked, will double its efforts and create even more destruction, is it really wise to go after evil?\\"  The bad guys cause huge destruction after Batman and Gordon squeeze the mafia, creating enormous conflict and guilt in Batman.  But without disturbing the hornet's nest, evil would prevail anyway.  So the battle must be joined in any event.      Harvey Dent is extremely complex.  He berates Gordon for compromising his police unit by accepting some corrupt officers to his staff.  Gordon answers byclaiming that sometimes those who know corruption can be the most effective in fighting it.  Dent is identified as the \\"White Knight\\" whose public persona will rally the public against evil.  But Dent himself participates in an untruthful diversion to help trap The Joker.  Even he compromises good for the sake of fighting evil.      When Rachel and Dent are being held in danger Batman and Gordon each race to save them.  Batman declares he is going to save Rachel but is tricked into going to Dent's location.  Rachel dies and Dent is severely injured.  In a brilliant make-up creation the right side of Dent's face remains normal and the left side is severely and dramatically changed.   He has physically transformed from a White Knight into his derisive nickname, \\"Two Face.\\"  Reminiscent of Jekyll and Hyde, Dent's nature is now permanently divided.       The death of Rachel has destroyed Dent's belief in good and has dissolved his commitment to the public's welfare.  Now he only thinks of his own personal pain and loss.  But he is not a creature of pure evil.  His hurt and grudge turn him into a near nihilist.  The lucky coin with two heads has been transformed.  One side is now ruined and becomes for him the oracle of ethics.  Life and death depend solely on chance; solely on the flip of a coin.      Furious at Gordon for the actions of the corrupt police officers in Gordon's unit who betrayed Rachel, Dent finds Gordon's wife and children.  Recognizing that Gordon's young son is dearest to him, Dent demands that Gordon reassure the son as Dent flips his coin to decide the boy's fate.      Batman, for whom good and evil, life and death, are not decided by chance, intervenes.  In their fight Dent and Batman both plunge to the ground from a height.  Batman survives and tells Gordon that the myth of Dent's goodness must become the rallying point for the city.  Dent remains the White Knight, while Batman allows himself to become The Dark Knight, spurned by the public, identified wrongly but necessarily as the source of evil, who can then secretly work for the good.  Only Gordon and his son know the true story behind this myth.  Gotham thus gets the hero it deserves.    The Joker is captured but his fate is left hanging, literally and figuratively.  We do not even know for certain whether Dent died, or unconscious, has survived his fall.  All we know for sure is that the complexity of fighting evil and the compromises permitted for good are unsolved.  Civilization continues but only barely.  The Joker has destroyed Rachel, transformed Dent, and caused everlasting turmoil and doubt within Batman.      The need to resort to myth over facts after arguing previously for the absolute value of Truth, ends Plato's Republic, with the famous story of the myth of the cave.  We too are left in the dark, in the company of The Dark Knight, at the end of this superb film.      We can only wonder what the sequel might have been, with The Joker and Two Face challenging Batman, had Heath Ledger survived.      Speaking of Heath Ledger I want to mention a few things about his performance as The Joker.  There is a small pantheon of presentations of psychiatrically deranged individuals in film.  Among the best are Olivia Thailand in Snake Pit, Gregory Peck in Spellbound, Jack Nickelson in One Flew Over The Cuckoo's Nest, and Heath Ledger in The Dark Knight.  Ledger's perhaps surpasses them all.     For those with a psychiatric or medical background like myself, the use of his slight head tics and the seemingly random movement of his tongue suggest that The Joker has been in a psychiatric institution and medicated with drugs that left him with a case of tardive dyskinesia, a rare but serious and irreversible movement disorder that can be a side effect of certain psychotropic medications.  This touch, which I believe was meticulously and masterfully added to the portrayal by Ledger, makes The Joker both more convincing and more dangerous.     I am told thatLedger immersed himself in The Joker's state of mind before and during the filming.  It is not unknown for an actor to have difficulty extricating himself from such a wrenching and demanding role.  Joaquin Phoenix and Faye Dunaway have each spoken about this as they worked to emerge from Johnny Cash and Joan Crawford.  If this was so for Ledger then The Joker got an undeserved bitter laugh while we have only tears.        Addendum July 23, 2008:  One of The Joker's henchmen must have gotten into my spell checker to change Olivia De Havilland into Olivia Thailand.  Sorry for that.    I want to expand on one point distinguishing Batman from Dent.  When The Joker reveals the locations of Rachel and Dent, Gordon asks Batman which location he is going to.  Batman says Rachel's but I believe he is aware of The Joker's double crosses and switches, and knowingly goes to Dent's location.  That Batman expresses no surprise at finding Dent rather than Rachel confirms this view.  Bruce Wayne would have rescued Rachel but Batman, a true hero, puts his public duty above his private preferences.      After Rachel is killed Dent loses his sense of public duty and loses faith in goodness.  Batman, equally in love with Rachel and equally convinced she will marry him, retains his public duty and goodness, though he is burdened with grief and guilt.  Perhaps a White Knight cannot endure crushing disappointment.  Perhaps only a Dark Knight, who has already experienced the crushing loss of viewing the murders of his father and mother, and holding himself responsible for that tragedy, can make his way through darkness without losing his way.      A final note, in response to a commenter who took issue with my portrayal of Gordon as incorruptibly good, I agree that Gordon made pragmatic choices, and refer to them in the essay.  But as a person he is beyond bribery and never loses sight of his duty to the citizenry.  So how about personally incorruptible but one who made some seemingly necessary but ultimately unwise alliances.
B000N6TX1I|1.0|This film had been highly recommended. I found it slow, depressing and the \\"stunning visuals\\" not worth watching. The story line was neither original or interesting. I've watched it twice  hoping to find something worth  praising, but found nothing.  If you're into really depressing films  hyped as \\"realistic\\"  this is for you.
015603283X|4.0|The author did a good job developing the characters and the plot.  The old manuscripts/books angle kept my interest.  Having seen some Spanish, Argentine, and Mexican films, I'd have to say the ending of Club Dumas was very much in line with types of endings many Spanish speaking films have - bizarre!  This was a good read.  I would definitely recommend this book.  I will also read books by this author again.
B0016HNOXQ|5.0|This is a genuinely avant-garde album, with all kinds of unexpected twists and turns. It is not tuneful the way of trip hop--this album is more \\"out there.\\"     I didn't like their earlier records all that much, they didn't seem to do \\"tuneful\\" trip hop as well as, say, Morcheeba, and the odd touches they threw in struck me as relatively tame.     Very little about this records is tame. I wouldn't recommend this one for everyone, but if your musical tastes are edgy, this is definitely worth checking out.
B000ULQV0W|5.0|Lovely music and Eddie's soulful vocals, as well as meaningful lyrics with substance - what more can you ask for? I love what these songs say and the way Eddie conveys these emotions. It's music that I find very poignant and honest and - for personal reasons - impossible not to connect with.<br /><br />On a side note:<br />Like me, Eddie Vedder is a huge fan of the Australian rock group The Church - a band that I highly recommend. Begin with Gold Afternoon Fix, After Everything Now This, or Untitled # 23.
B0017JKEL8|5.0|After missing season 1 in its entirety when it originally aired, I had to see what all the hype was about.  I picked up this blu-ray edition of season 1 and all of the hype was well deserved.    Simply put, Mad Men is one of the best shows I have ever watched and without a doubt the best season of television I have seen since the first few seasons of The Sopranos.      The story arc is enthralling, and the talented group of actors do a tremendous job of giving life to every character in the show.  For anyone looking for a show that is at times dramatic, funny, shocking, and endearing, but always excellent, look no further.  I highly recommend not only this show, but this blu-ray version as it is a tremendous deal for 13, 1-hour episodes.    Speaking of blu-ray, the picture quality is fantastic.  Colors bounce off the screen, and those with 1080p sets will be constantly surprised with the level of detail givin to even specs of facial hair, or the weavings of cloth on clothing.  This is without a doubt the best 30 bucks I have spend on Amazon.  Buy it now!
B000CNFC76|4.0|Disney does it again...taking a true story and adding the Disney touch to pull your hearstrings. A story about rising above and fulfilling your dreams. Everyone will love it and golfers will adore it! As good as the Legend of Bagger Vance and almost on par with Bobby Jones Stoke of Genius.PUN INTENDED.
B000RPTQ1C|1.0|It's amazing how much these guys just plain suck. I wish I could say, as a musicologist and collector (I'll listen to anything--even rap, if properly motivated), that I'm wrong and this is a great record, and you should queue it up right now but I can't. I can't because I believe in music enough to try sway you away from this mess. Let the British have them. Who the hell cares? Travis is a much better--and I'm not even a fan of Travis! If you like them, good for you because we should all listen to what we like. But if you're feeling pressured by record companies, don't pony up the $13 for this lamentable product. They (Cold Play) can't be taking it too seriously, and neither should you.
B0011HOEY4|5.0|As I was warned that there is \\"nothing new\\" about this film, I was unsure if it was worth it.  To be sure, the story is pretty run-of-the-mill:  after a long apprenticeship with a Harlem manipulator, a young hustler figures out a new way to get pure heroin into the country.  He then runs it like a business, establishing a superior brand and building an empire.  Meanwhile, a cop focuses on him, and you can guess the rest.<br /><br />What made this a fabulous experience was the acting:  Washington is second to none in his ability to project an entire environment and background into every gesture.  Crowe is also superb as an honest, though troubled cop, who gets extraordinary powers to build a team and pursue him.  In between, you get a vivid (and thankfully not too detailed) picture of the times, from the Vietnam War to the changing role of blacks in US society.  Taken together, the film is a true gem, one of Scott's best in my opinion.<br /><br />Warmly recommended.
B0019EXZY4|4.0|Set in London in the early 1970s, THE BANK JOB is based on real life events.  A group of would be criminals is set up by MI5 (or 6, no one can keep them straight) to rob a bank and regain compromising photos of a royal personage.  Unfortunately for our gang, not only were the photos in question (which were the \\"property\\" of corrupt revolutionary Michael X) kept in a safe deposit box at this bank, but so were the secrets and lies of many famous and infamous people, including the payola ledgers of a porn kingpin and the photo files of a well-placed local madam.  Everybody who was anybody, from the cops on the beat up to the Lords of the Realm, was implicated in some scandal by the evidence from this notorious bank robbery.<br /><br />THE BANK JOB is a fun, exciting, tension-filled romp.  These amateur crooks catch more breaks and have more close calls than you would imagine possible.  While the film does slightly bog down on occasion, for the most part the pacing builds just the right amount of suspense with these twists and turns of fate.  In several places, my heart was actually racing.  By the end, our villains are the heroes, and everyone gets what they truly deserve.<br /><br />I really liked the cinematography of this film.  THE BANK JOB actually looks like it was filmed in the 1970s.  At one point, I double-checked with my husband to confirm that it was a recent movie.  The effect used is very convincing, producing a very authentic look. The ensemble cast was quite good, performing as a cohesive unit, but no individual really standing out.<br /><br />THE BANK JOB is a great movie for an entertaining evening at home.  My husband and I really had a lot of fun.  And we got to learn a little history from the 1970s as well.

B00007J5VN|4.0|Enjoyed it but wondered if Gwen Verdon should have continued her stage role onto the screen.  I remember a serious faux pas when Julie Andrews was bypassed for Audrey Hepburn in My Fair Lady.
B001B71NOI|4.0|Agree with the other reviewer. There is not a new thing here. NIN's music used to be more emotive and varied when there were longer gaps between released. The Slip is a great rock record, but the same lyrics, riffs and song structures are here that you heard on Ghosts, Year Zero, and With Teeth. Not a bad thing, but I wont preach about how amazing it is...not this time. Echoplex is a great track. Love the beat. This album is almost more minimal than a lot of the tracks on Ghosts. Am I the only one who has heard Trent say \\"I can't stop myself\\" and \\"on my hands and knees\\" one too many times? Get it if you have all the others because it is still a good record. Just don't expect change.
B000006IUQ|2.0|I live in Alaska, and this movie does not portray Alaska properly.  Bears are not predatory towards humans, and the bear in this movie is a real work of fiction.  I would hate people to see this and think that real bears act this way, because they never do.  Bears do not hunt down humans, nor see them as a food source or enemy.  By far the most dangerous thing in Alaska is the weather and remoteness, not the wildlife.  If you can get past how ridiculous the bear is in the film, it is mildly entertaining.
B000002JAX|5.0|This is a terrific CD.  Everyone who listens to it loves it.  This is the first CD I have purchased by this artist.  I plan to purchase more.  I can't say enough about it.  I highly recommend it for your listening pleasure.  You won't be sorry you purchased it.
B001BR5F4C|5.0|not sure what the complaints are for 20 bucks a disk for blu-ray?  that's pretty decent.
B0012QE4Q2|3.0|You really have to take this movie for what it is. It's just a big, dumb historical soap opera, with pretty locations, some Hollywood actresses, and a lot of nice frocks. I sat down on a wet afternoon and watched the DVD, and found it reasonably amusing. It is, of course, wildly historically inaccurate, but so was the Philippa Gregory book it was based on, so you can't be too hard on the film-makers for that. What it does lack are the book's strengths, which include tight plotting, good construction, and a clever manipulation of point-of-view throughout. When you read the novel, you see familiar events through the point of view of a naive woman (Mary Boleyn) who does not know how things are going to turn out; right up to the end, you half-believe, with Mary, that things are going to work out all right. This creates a dramatic tension that is wholly lacking in the film version. In the film, the director underlines from the start that things are going to end badly for Anne. Well, we all know she ends up decapitated, but it would be nice to have a bit of suspense along the way.    The twist in Philippa Gregory's novel is that all the characters are absolutely as bad as their worst historical reputations. Her Anne is a guilty manipulative adulteress, a portrait which is unfair to the historical woman, if entertaining in a novel; here, the film-makers shy away from making her out to be as black as Gregory paints her (Henry VIII, on the other hand, emerges as a rapist, which for all his sins is one thing I don't think any historian has ever accused him of). Other characters are softened too, notably Lady Elizabeth Boleyn, the girls' mother, and the self-seeking George Boleyn, who here is just a nice boy whose parents force him to marry a girl he doesn't like. Nor is the court the sink of iniquity it seems in the book. It is extremely annoying that Mary's first husband, William Carey simply disappears (she was actually widowed, but we are never told so), while her romancewith her second husband--a marriage that is social suicide, but which is ultimately her salvation--barely gets off the ground. There is no sense of love or even affection developing between them, which weakens the story considerably. But clearly the big relationship here is the love-hate between the sisters, and any romance other than the struggle for the king's affections is purely secondary.    All in all, this is a pretty but forgettable film, with some nice costumes, a weak script, and some reasonably good acting from the female leads.
0307278409|5.0|Xiaolu Guo is a native of China and has published several books there. This is her first novel written in English and was published hardcover in 2007, now paperback. She now divides her time between Beijing and London.    Like the author, the novel's main character, Zhuang Xiao Qiao, is a young Chinese woman who spends a year in London to study English. The story is told as a series of journal/diary entries that are in part written to her British lover, a man she meets in a movie theater. In a rather unusual way, she moves in with him after misunderstanding the phrase, \\"be my guest.\\" She refers to \\"you\\" as this man.    At the beginning of the book, the writing is stilted, incorrect and confusing- just exactly the way a non-native speaker would likely think and write in her new language. She keeps a dictionary at hand all of the time and constantly looks up new words and definitions. She also as an insatiable curiosity and asks many questions. As the book progresses so does the sentence structure and Zhuang's understanding of English and Western culture.    Guo's re-creation of language learning is fascinating. The character of Zhuang is both naïve and wise. She shares her most personal thoughts and actions and readily explores the difficulties inherent in living in a new country with a new language. Zhuang also takes some time to travel by Euro-pass railroad through France, Germany, Spain and Portugal. Her impressions of these countries and the people she meets also offer a different perspective on Chinese culture.    However, this is not a book for every reader. I enjoyed it, but must note that there is a lot of very explicit sexual activity and talk in the novel. While it works with the context of the book, I'm sure it would be a turn-off for some readers.    Armchair Interviews says: Heed this reviewer's specific comments; otherwise a 5-star read.
B00005JPY0|3.0|Five minutes in to THE DARK NIGHT, I'm asking myself, \\"What's happened to Gotham?!?!\\"  In BATMAN BEGINS, the city was almost a character itself.  Dark, glossy, seedy.  It had islands and elevated subways.  It felt like SIN CITY on a huge budget.  Now it looks like downtown Chicago, or LA or Toronto.  An \\"ordinary\\" city.  I knew then that director Christopher Nolan and his gang were going to try to make Batman realistic...to make him a part of OUR world.    Big mistake.    I'll acknowledge right here and now that I'm not a huge \\"comic book\\" fan.  I pretty much see all the movies...but I never drool in anticipation of them either.  With the recent exceptions of the surprisingly entertaining IRON MAN and the fabulously inventive HELLBOY II...there hasn't been much that's gotten me excited in this genre.  XMEN and SPIDERMAN (and the sequels) were mostly fluffy entertainment.  Not that there's anything wrong with that...it's fine.    But prior to seeing DARK KNIGHT, I've been hearing from critics and co-workers alike that this was a movie unlike any other.  One friend said, \\"I think it may be the best movie I've EVER seen!!!,\\" and his eyes were aglow with fervor.  So I guess it was my mistake waiting until Monday after opening to see the film. I tried to resist the hype and the expectation of a life-changing event...but clearly I bought into it some, because the movie was a pretty significant letdown.    Not only were the settings mundane (heck, Batman even goes on a little sidetrip to Hong Kong!)...but I found several key plot developments to be difficult to buy into because the characters hadn't earned my belief.  I don't want to spoil much of the plot, but suffice it to say that I never really saw that Harvey Dent passionately loved Rachel...and thus subsequent events in his life simply didn't ring true psychologically.    Let me backtrack.  The plot...or at least the skeleton.  Bruce Wayne, aka Batman, has turned Gotham into a much safer city.  Criminals are on the run.  Regular citizens (some dressed as Batman) are fighting back and trying to reclaim their city.  Harvey Dent (Aaron Eckhart) is the new DA, and he appears to be honest about his desire to root out crime.  Lt. Gordon (Gary Oldman) is still virtuously carrying on HIS fight against crime.  In fact, Bruce Wayne is actually thinking of hanging up the old batsuit and throwing his support behind the new DA, so that crime can be fought out in the open.    Enter The Joker...a maniacal evil-genius with a grotesque face and an even more horrible penchant for murder and mayhem.  Always once step ahead (or two or three) of anyone trying to stop him, and apparently without any motive other than to bring about chaos...he begins to unravel all the plans of these noble men.    A complicated series of plot developments ensues...some quite exciting to watch.  Midway through the film, we're treated to a lengthy car & truck chase, followed by Joker's brief but memorable incarceration.  Those few scenes, when  he's interrogated by various \\"forces of good\\" while clearly all the while hatching a scheme to cause even more death and destruction, are thrilling, tight and have several terrific payoffs all at once.  It is worth the entire 2.5 hours to enjoy those 20 minutes or so.    Much has been made of Heath Ledger's performance as The Joker.  It is certainly an inventive and even compelling performance.  But he's an outrageous character in a world that Nolan is trying so hard to make feel like our own.  Ledger is playing on a different wavelength from his fellow actors.  What makes me admire his performance is that Ledger, at least, understood how this story SHOULD have been placed tonally.  Joker is \\"askew\\" and the film should have been too.  The Joker never changes throughout the film...he's always evil and maniacal...thus, the performance doesn't quite deserve the accolades heaped on it.  I know Ledger's untimely death was tragic...but I think it has clouded the eyes of some to the performance.  (Before you send hate mail...the performance IS very good.  He's a treat to watch, and when he dons a nurse's uniform, he truly takes this role into another level.  His glee is palpable, as is his menace.)    Sadly, almost all other performances are off the mark.  Christian Bale is boring as Bruce Wayne (and makes Wayne quite unlikeable) and the voice he's chosen to use for Batman is SO distracting.  Maggie Gylenhaal (who CAN be quite luminescent and wonderful), is terrible and annoying.  Gary Oldman (another fine actor) has a silly accent and not much else to offer.  And poor Aaron Eckhart.  Here's a guy who can be PERFECT in the right role (think THANK YOU FOR SMOKING).  If you need a smooth, glossy, faux sincere politician...this is your guy.  If you need a lovestruck, insecure man...he can't pull it off.  And if you need histrionics or thunderous theatrics...he's completely out of his league.  Michael Caine is enjoyable in a much reduced role as Arthur, Wayne's butler and moral compass.  Morgan Freeman is featured a little more...but mostly looks dewy-eyed at Wayne.  (You know who DOES get where the tone of this movie should be?  Eric Roberts, in his smallish role as a local mob leader.  He overacts just a smidge...and it's just right!)    I believe Nolan is trying to make the film a rumination on how fine the line between righteous action and fanatical action are.  How good intentions can turn sour so easily.  It might be a stab at \\"anti-terrorism\\" fervor...the very tired question of \\"are our actions to root out terrorism just making us into our own brand of terrorists.\\"  But the efforts to illuminate this philosophical musing sometimes lead to some dead-ends dramatically.    I'm still giving the film 3 stars...because it dares to try a lot.  It isn't afraid to make a very complex story, both psychologically and in terms of plot.  It doesn't talk down to the audience.  But in attempting so much...it misses more than it hits.  Yet it has the great Joker sequences in the middle, incredible special effects for the character of Two-Face, and it does feature Nestor Carbonell as the Mayor of Gotham.  Why is that good.  Because once upon a time, Carbonell was featured in the live-action TV series THE TICK.  His character?  Batmanuel.  The circle of life, kids!
0316010669|4.0|Blink has changed the way I think about decision-making. From an early age we are discouraged from making \\"snap\\" decisions, we are not taught to develop our natural instincts. While some snap decisions can be mistakes, if we tune up our \\"gut\\" feelings, it may be possible to make excellent decisions based on limited information and time constraints. Gladwell calls this \\"thin-slicing\\" and make no mistake about it - it is a SKILL that must be cultivated.<br /><br />In a nutshell, thin-slicing is defined as \\"the ability of our unconscious to find patterns in situations and behaviors based on very narrow slices of experience.\\" The most fascinating part to me is just that - as a human being, we do have this capability. If you're like me, you do a significant amount of second-guessing, and that is where the trouble starts. We have the instincts inside of us, our brains are powerful tools - more powerful than the most sophisticated computer, they tell us, right? So why do we not trust ourselves?<br /><br />To be honest, the book started out great with some fascinating examples of thin-slicing and adaptive unconscious (the part of the brain that leaps to conclusions and is capable of making very quick decisions based on very little information). Towards the end I felt like it was just the same information over and over again. I got the gist of it all in the first couple of chapters. Many reviewers here indicated that it could have been an article instead of a book, but I understand why it is a book: Books are taken seriously, are reviewed, are cited, and are easy to find after publication.<br /><br />Blink is worth the read, even if you only skim a few parts, if only to get you thinking differently about the way we make decisions.
006135323X|3.0|In the spirit of Freakonomics, you'll find Predictably Irrational to be a fun, interesting look at behavioral economics.  Why do we do some of the things we do?  It has some interesting data and let's you think through some of your own actions.  The only problem with the book is that the author makes an attempt at the end of some of the sections to provide his own answers.  That is when it can be a little scary.  For example, he doesn't quite understand the basic economics of Maxi-Min theory, and thinks it is irrational to want a free $10 gift certificate instead of paying $7 for a $20 gift certificate.  Ummm, if you wind up not using the gift certificate, you are $7 better off doing what he would think is irrational.<br /><br />More troubling to me was his statist view (for those unfamiliar with what Statism is -- it is the desire for massive government similar to what Democrats and Republicans desire -- it is the opposite of Libertarianism).  The author argues that since people are irrational, government should take over some decisions for them (as if government wasn't just a collective, larger irrationality).  To the author, it is better that we all suffer the same dismal fate instead of some people being better off.  As an American (in the sense that I prefer liberty and freedom), I find his statist/socialist leanings a bit overbearing and unnecessary in this book.
B00005JPY0|5.0|When I was a little boy, my father took me to the theater to see a great film, \\"Raiders of the Lost Ark\\", and I was so impressed by the experience that I figured all 'summer films' would be as good. Little did I know I was in for many years of disappointment. My mother saw my permanent frown and asked \\"Why so glum?\\"<br /><br />After watching \\"The Dark Knight\\", my permanent frown is now a smile as wide as possible. My faith has been restored. But will my smile slowly disappear as one filmmaker after another submits a series of bad films for our perusal, wreaking havoc with my mind?<br /><br />\\"The Dark Knight\\" is a great film. A film better than any fans had any right to expect or hope for. It is the rare summer sequel that will cause people to eagerly anticipate more summer fare. Maybe this isn't a good thing because the majority of summer films we are subjected to aren't worth the trouble and will inevitably let us down.<br /><br />All of the best superhero movies feature both strong heroes and strong villains. And Christopher Nolan understands this. He also ups the ante considerably. But in doing so, he has created a massive film that breaks a lot of rules and is pretty challenging, for summer fare; you will actually have to pay attention to the labyrinth story and characters. But the film is also better because Nolan tries these things and accomplishes. In fact he has set the bar so high, it is now clear that all future superhero films will be measured against the first two \\"Spiderman\\" films or maybe \\"Iron Man\\". Nolan's vision of Batman has transcended the genre of superhero film.<br /><br />\\"The Dark Knight\\" is darker, much darker in tone than \\"Batman Begins\\" and this is something most summer films stay away from. Summer is a time for lighter fare, so making a film with a dark subject matter is a rule breaker. The fact that it works is all the more rewarding to the viewer.<br /><br />A void has been created in Gotham City. Batman (Christian Bale) has been so successful in his allegiance with Lt. Gordon (Gary Oldman), the underworld has gone in to hiding. All Gordon has to do is turn on the Bat Signal and criminals go into hiding. Recognizing this void, a psychotic named the Joker (Heath Ledger) steps in, ready and willing to create havoc and make things miserable for Batman and the new shining, white knight of Gotham City, District Attorney Harvey Dent (Aaron Eckhart). Dent isn't afraid of the underworld and sets about trying to clean up the city with the help of his assistant, Rachel Dawes (Maggie Gyllenhaal) who is also Bruce Wayne's former girlfriend. Wayne relies on the sage advice of his butler, Alfred (Michael Caine) and his inventor, Lucius Fox (Morgan Freeman). As the Joker's crimes become more elaborate and deadly, everyone tries to work together to put a stop to his actions. But there will be consequences.<br /><br />Nolan, who has created an impressive roster of films, adds \\"The Dark Knight\\" to this list and it is every bit as impressive as you can hope for. What really struck me about this film is how many different facets of it shouldn't work, but do. And this success stems from the director's skill. And also the screenplay he wrote with the aid of his brother, Jonathan. Both areas are crafted in such a way to make sure everything fits together and works.<br /><br />\\"The Dark Knight\\" is an involving, convoluted, long film. But it is also a film with a crystal clear message. And this message is both subtle and extremely in our face. All of the moments we watch are meant to illustrate this message and to provide further depth to the story. This in turn makes the story deeper, more interesting and the idea really hits home. When the Joker steps into the void that is Gotham City and begins to create havoc, he recognizes that he and Batman are two sides of the same coin. This is why he becomes so intent on exposing \\"the Batman\\", because he is convinced that no one is that good, someone who rides around in a cape and mask helping people, must have something to hide. And he wants this 'hero' exposed. He frequently provides a death toll of what he perceives are Batman's actions when they meet. This is the more subtle presentation of this theme. When Bruce Wayne meets Harvey Dent (Aaron Eckhart), he is mildly jealous because Dent and Rachel Dawes (Maggie Gyllenhaal taking over the same role from Katie Holmes) are now a couple. But he also recognizes a kindred spirit and someone who can help his alter ego clean up the streets of Gotham. So Dent, with the help of Jim Gordon (Gary Oldman) and his friend, Batman, begin to arrest all of the crime lords of Gotham. Dent is everything Wayne wishes he could be, but without a mask and cape. Dent is even referred to as \\"The White Knight\\" on more than one occasion, an overt reference to how he and Bruce Wayne/ Batman are also two sides of the same coin. But Nolan isn't content to stop there and takes the theme even further, by introducing us to the villain Two Face. Two Face is a crazy mo-fo (all of which is understandable as you watch the film, we see his 'creation' during the course of the narrative) and he uses a two-headed coin to determine the fate of his victims.<br /><br />This brings me to my one small complaint about \\"The Dark Knight\\". In every great superhero film, we see the birth of both the hero and the villain. Obviously, while watching sequels, we have already seen the birth of the hero, so the film would concentrate on the birth of the villain and how the hero reacts to this. In \\"Knight\\", we see the creation of a villain, Two Face, but this happens late in the film. Much earlier, the Joker (Heath Ledger) explodes on the screen and begins his reign of terror. The Joker is a force to be reckoned with and Ledger gives a bravura performance and makes the character his own. Consider how difficult a task this must have been given he is following Jack Nicholson and even Cesar Romero in the same role. But Ledger explodes on the screen behind the Joker's greasy, gray green hair and his wickedly painted face. Scraping his hair back from his face with his knife razor as he licks his lips, you recognize this guy has a seriously twisted frame of mind. During the course of the film, he makes a few mentions of how he became the Joker, but you begin to doubt the validity of these claims and wonder if this isn't part of the psycho's modus operandi. In the end, Ledger's performance is so powerful you don't even mind that we don't have a back-story for the character. Another example of Nolan making something that shouldn't work successful.<br /><br />The Joker is what a villain should be. Scary, unpredictable and ruthless. And he sets the bar for all others to follow. Even a brief appearance by Cillian Murphy, returning as the Scarecrow, only serves to show how much better Ledger is as the Joker. Murphy was good in \\"Begins\\", but he pales in comparison.<br /><br />Christian Bale returns as Batman and Bruce Wayne and seems more conflicted. He is dealing with his feelings for Rachel, who is now dating Harvey Dent. He has to push this feelings aside because he feels Dent holds real promise for the city, so he resorts to making mild, playful jabs at both of them, trying to win Rachel back. As Batman battles the Joker, he has to deal with a bunch of other forces at the same time; suspected corruption in the police force, protecting the city officials, trying to help round up the underworld leaders. He brings a heightened level of intensity to the character, giving us a deeper feeling for what Wayne is experiencing.<br /><br />Michael Caine returns as Alfred, Wayne's butler, who is always ready to provide some sage advice. Caine is a great actor and it is nice to see him in a supporting role like this because even though Alfred doesn't have the biggest role in the story, he actually sort of does. He is the man who helps Wayne stay centered, stay calm and make the right decisions.<br /><br />Morgan Freeman returns as Lucius Fox, the brains behind Wayne Industries. Sort of like Wayne's own personal \\"Q\\", Fox prepares all of the tools Batman needs to fight the baddies. He also helps Wayne run the huge corporation he owns and gives him the support he needs.<br /><br />Maggie Gyllenhaal steps into the role of Rachel Dawes and does a very good job. You see how tough this woman is, how unwilling she is to put up with anything, how determined she is to help Harvey beat the bad guys. Don't forget, she is one of only a handful of people who know the true identity of Batman and she remains true to this knowledge, protecting it even from Harvey. Whenever she appears within feet of Bruce Wayne, you can see the pain in her face, the pain of their breakup. Gyllenhaal is certainly a different type of look than Katie Holmes and I think the fit is a little better. Tall and lanky, much like some of the classic sirens of the 40s (I'm thinking Rita Hayworth or Gene Tierney), she just seems to be a better fit for Wayne and Dent.<br /><br />Gary Oldman also returns as Lt. Gordon, an honest man who is as intent on cleaning up the city as Dent and Batman. He will do whatever it takes.<br /><br />Nolan has assembled a great cast, each of whom brings a special quality to their portrayals of these characters. But he has also assembled a top-notch creative crew as well, and the film is as technically beautiful and accomplished as the performances.<br /><br />One thing that stuck out to me was the sound design of the film. In a handful of moments, a great panoramic view of Gotham pops up accompanied by slight white noise. No music. Then, as the scene begins, you would expect the music to swell and give us cues to how we should feel. But it doesn't and we continue to hear a slight bit of white noise as the characters battle it out. This is a great way of showing us what the characters are experiencing, what is driving the Joker mad, what is making Batman all the more anxious to have a normal life. There is noticeably less music in this film than most big budget action<br /><br />It has been widely reported that Nolan shot the action scenes for this film with an IMAX camera. Does this add anything to the film? It provides a wider canvas for the action, giving us bigger, crystal clear images, more information and more to look at. Quite honestly, the action scenes are fantastic and watching Bale's Batman speed through Gotham in the Batmobile or on the Batbike are just the beginnings of much more complicated action scenes. Much of the film takes place at night and even these scenes are beautiful to watch because they are slightly moody, yet we never lose sight of the actors or the action.<br /><br />Watching \\"The Dark Knight\\" is an exciting thing. It is the rare film that breaks so many rules, yet you don't feel like you have been cheated. So, we have two villains in an already overcrowded film. But they work together as two distinct parts of the story. We have a convoluted story, requiring the viewer to pay attention, to keep track of everything that is going on. How many other 'summer films' can you think of that did this? Probably less than you can count on one hand. There is a lot of story in \\"Knight\\" but it all points to one theme, as discussed before, and all of this story helps to reinforce the main ideas. The cast is filled with superlative actors, giving each of the characters depth we wouldn't normally expect from 'popcorn fare'. And the film is dark, darker than its predecessor.<br /><br />\\"The Dark Knight\\" is the summer film we all want and hope for every time we plunk down our hard earned dollars for a film. Now that we have had the pleasure of experiencing this work, we will be expecting more summer films to be this good. I'm not sure if that is a good thing, because we are inevitably in for more letdowns.<br /><br />What have you done to us, Christopher Nolan?ainted face.

B00005JNJV|5.0|I think this film has been under appreciated because it is not a traditional action film or superhero film. It is a hero's journey, as in the old times. Like most such journeys, the protagonist is thrown into the situation by circumstances beyond his control. But, the journey is of his own making.  Teens may not like it as much because it explores the broader themes of law, justice, ends justifying the means (or not), and what it really means to be good vs. evil. It does not do this just from a few tossed off lines (such as the new DK movie does), but through the story arc itself. Hopefully some will understand better the ambiguity of our governmental actions around the world and the difficulties of trying to balance safety/security against freedom/rights.  Really worth seeing.
1593082010|5.0|Best romance book ever written and one of the top ten books of all time, in my opinion.  Jane Austen has a remarkable skill for capturing cultural snapshots and portraying the essence of human nature like no other author I can identify.  I also love the BBC movie version for the complete story and the recent movie with Keira Knightly for the highlights.  I only purchase the Barnes and Noble collection for my classic books because they look nice together on shelves and have interesting introductions.
B001ACY8D2|5.0|I didn't expect another masterpiece from Sigur Ros. And again, no surprises. Sigur Ros changed a bit their style, mostly in the first part of the album. A new pace that makes you clap your hands (the first track)forgetting for a while the former extended soft sound of the endless icelandic landscape. I have been to their concert in Florence 2 weeks ago. Absolutely amazing.
B00002DEGZ|5.0|Mozart was a Mason. A child of the Enlightenment. A believer in humanity's perfectability, who had the philosophical luck to die before the disappointments of the French revolution. He wrote music of tragedy and despair, but he never wrote a note of Gothic horror, of 'Romantic' reaction against rationality, a task he left untouched, shall we say, for the next generation. If you want your Mozart to sound like the art of someone who's been reading Schopenhauer, you won't like this set of piano concertos played by Malcolm Bilsen, with John Eliot Gardiner conducting.<br /><br />Bilsen plays a period keyboard fortepiano, an instrument of much lighter construction than the modern pianoforte, on which the 'decay' of note reverberation is naturally quicker, making a softer and more transparent sound. The orchestra of period instruments that Gardiner conducts is also smaller by far and more carefully tuned than the modern symphony orchestra, and emphasizes the polyphonic/heterophonic interplay of all the voices of the composition. The tempi chosen by Gardiner are often faster, more nimble, more witty than most post-Wagnerian conductors choose. The result is a Mozart who sounds as if he's passed Sarastro's \\"initiation\\" into wisdom as portrayed in the Magic Flute, rather than settling into the syphilitic gloom of 19th C Romantic pianism.<br /><br />There is no absolutely historically authenticized version of Mozart, and double-absolutely no \\"definitive\\" performance of these twenty-seven concertos. I recently made the tongue-in-cheek suggestion that a performance of them on harpsichord might be revealing, since Mozart grew up in a milieu in which harpsichords were far more familiar than pianos of any sort. The touch required to play the fortepiano, Bilsen's instrument, is closer in some ways to a harpsichord touch than that developed by Liszt and Chopin. It's the touch, as much as the specific instrument, that matters for performing Mozart. Bilsen has the touch. I like his sound, a judgement by ear alone, better than that of Derek Han or Melvyn Tan, two other historical keyboard specialists. And I admire Gardiner's spunk - his musical intuition - even when occasionally his interpretations are rash.<br /><br />But don't take my word for anything! Use the sample function; compare the same snippets from the same concertos on as many recordings as you have patience for. I'd suggest Concerto #20.d, a judgement by ear alone, better than that of Derek Han or Melvyn Tan, two other historical keyboard specialists. And I admire Gardiner's spunk - his musical intuition - even when occasionally his interpretations are rash.<br /><br />But don't take my word for anything!

B0017I1FP8|3.0|I haven't heard this soundtrack on it's own yet,but,as with the Batman Begins music,the sounds don't exactly come up short but they don't add that essential extrinsic element to the film:in short it's just too subtle.Nolan's trademark has been visually dark films filled with chirascurro(sp?)so if the music is supposed to blend with that style than Zimmer and Shamalan's guy have done the job by making the music smaller in scale than the other elements of the movie.It's 90% backdrop to the screen action.My issue with that is when I think of Batman I think of Elfman's theme(I know,I know--\\"get over it,these ones are different\\").I think that a better pairing of composers would've been Howard Shore and Lustmord.Howard's capable of epic,adrenaline-pumping stuff a-la LOTR but can also hit very subtle emotions with stuff like what he's done with Cronenberg(Eastern Promises,Madame Butteryfly,Dead Ringers,etc);and he'd pair up well with Lustmord if Nolan insists on having the atmospheric,ambient textures to the songs.Lustmord worked on both Underworld scores(he was the only good thing about them)and a few other things,but he's capable of making much deeper,darker textures than these two guys;I don't even want to think how creepy his Joker themes would've been(Lustmord's also got a new album out today featuring members of Tool,the Melvins,and others if anyone's interested;it's called \\"Other\\" I believe).<br /><br />Anyway,the music fit the film just fine I thought,but it just didn't add that extra element.Think of watching \\"Blue Velvet\\" with a very subdued theme or having Star Wars scored by Steve Roach--that's how I felt after both of Nolan's Batman films.Cool,but a part of the experience felt \\"left behind\\".I gotta hand it to 'em for at least giving some fairly unsettling music for Joker.The string section worked when they were screeching to no end,but failed with the repetitive build-ups that went no-where during action scenes.
080701429X|5.0|An incredibly powerful, moving account of Frankl's concentration camp experience.  His reflections are profound and will bless you deeply.  The second half of the book includes an in-depth pyscological exploration that some will not find as digestible; but this is a rich part of the book and well worth the time.  Highly recommended.
1563894696|4.0|Jeph Loeb and Tim Sale penned a dark, noirish tale that sent the Dark Knight on a year-long crusade to stop the mob killing done by a villain known as Holiday.  It features appearances by the most infamous characters in Batman's Rogues Gallery (Joker, Penquin, Riddler, Poison Ivy, Scarecrow, and Mad Hatter, as well as the unfamiliar to me Calendar Man).  Catwoman appears to be connected to the killings in a big way.  What drew me to the book (it WAS first published periodically beginning in 1995) was the portrayal of Harvey Dent.  The rise and fall of the DA was surely the basis for the character's portrayal in the movie The Dark Knight.
B00102FELM|3.0|I've loved the Scorps for just about as long as they've been a band and couldn't wait to see this DVD.      The music is fantastic, but as is written on other reviews, the production is amateur.  The camera changes every 3-4 seconds so you never get to focus on anything.  That would have been a cool effect every so often but not through the whole thing.  The sound is not so great in places.  On Coast to Coast, you can barely hear the lead guitar in places which is what makes that song so great, especially for a simple instrumental.    I wish they could take their footage and soundtrack and remix it better.  This could have / should have been a much higher quality production.    But still, it's the Scorps and I'll watch it a thousand times!
B000YABIQ6|5.0|Mad Men is the first original drama series from the cable network AMC and they hit it out of the ballpark.  Set in 1960 and focusing on a fictional advertising agency Sterling Cooper, the show tells the story of ad men in a haze of cigarette smoke and booze.  The first episode foreshadows the change in our culture as the firm struggles to find a new advertising campaign for Lucky Strike cigarettes now that the government won't allow them to use testimonials from doctors that cigarettes are safe.  The show is fanatical with its attention to period detail.  Show creator Matthew Weiner has extensively researched the products, clothes and just about everything else from the period and has created a picture perfect time warp. But that is just a shiny veneer for the deep and dark storylines that include a secret past with a changed identity, depression, heart attacks, infidelity and so many others.  The show shoots off in so many directions, yet never loses focus.  The anchor of the show is Jon Hamm who plays the main character Don Draper.  Mr. Hamm is a revelation and his work is the best of any actor on television this year.  The rest of cast is first rate as well and Mad Men is one of the best and most entertaining shows to debut in past few years.
0312360266|3.0|This is the first book in the House of Night series by PC and Kirstin Cast.  I was interested in this series because it was recommended for people who liked the Twilight series.<br /><br />Zoey Redbird is leading a fairly normal life, when during school she is Marked.  Being Marked means she is one of the Chosen who are meant to undergo a change into a vampyre.  Her mom and born-again-Christian-like step-father do not take kindly to this and see it as Zoey's fault that she has been Marked.<br /><br />Zoey flees her house to move into the House of Night; which is an academy that helps people deal with the Change into vampyre.  Unfortunately Zoey even finds herself an outcast here when her mark mysteriously fills in, which it is not supposed to do until she is a full-fledged vampyre.<br /><br />I'll start out by saying I think a 5 year old could've written this book. Okay, maybe that's a slight exaggeration; but it is not high quality writing.  There is a lot of slang, a lot of teenage angsty stuffy, and a lot of fluff.  There are also a lot of stereotypical characters.  I also found Damien's use of words (and then the constant explanation of what those words meant) to be very silly.  That is really talking down to your readers and assuming they are not intelligent people.  I mean, if someone doesn't know a word, they can go and look it up online.<br /><br />All the negatives aside.  I found the story to be entertaining and the book was an easy (even if it was excessively easy) read.  I liked the idea of vampyrism being fate, I like the idea that some people don't survive the change, and I liked the inclusion of the Goddness Nix.  I also found some of the Cherokee folklore that was thrown in the mix to be creative and interesting.<br /><br />Despite the horrible writing and fluffiness of the characters I am sad to say that I actually did enjoy this book some.  I found Zoey to be interesting and am interested in what will happen to her in the next book.  So, since I didn't stop half way through the book in disgust and throw it out, there must be something good and engaging here.<br /><br />I will probably read the next book, but I will try not to buy it new but rather wait until I can get it used somewhere.  This level of writing just isn't worth spending my money on.  I think the Vampire Academy series by Richelle Mead is much more well-written and more interesting and I would strongly recommend reading that series in place of this one.  I have also heard good things about Rachel Caine's Morganville Vampire series.<br />karissabooks.blogspot.comisgust and throw it out, there must be something good and engaging here.

0385340990|5.0|Rarely do you catch me raving about books. Music - yes. Movies - yes.<br />Books - while I do love certain writers more than others, I have<br />rarely taken it upon myself to be a book evangelist, unless asked to<br />testify.<br /><br />However, I can no longer restrain myself, and wanted to tell you all about \\"The Guernsey Literary & Potato Peel Pie Society\\". I honestly cannot tell you the last time I enjoyed a book this much. I read a good bit of it while flying back from a recent trip, and stayed up to finish it that evening. I laughed, I cried, and more than that, I forgot that these weren't real people I was reading about.<br /><br />I realize that this is probably due to the technical style (the entire<br />story is told thru letters) but still, it caught me off guard. I'm<br />serious - at one point, it mentions a character who was forced to spend<br />some time at the Ravensbruck concentration camp. And as I read that, I<br />thought \\"Oh, she was there with Corrie Ten Boom and her sister. I<br />wonder if they knew each other.\\" Then I remembered that I was reading<br />a made-up story, and I felt grieved; because I thought they would have<br />all gotten along and could have helped each other endure that horrible<br />ordeal.<br /><br />Since I brought up Corrie Ten Boom, I will mention that there is no Christian sub-plot. Though moral, the characters are not spoken of as being 'Christian' and live their lives accordingly.<br /><br />The writers have done a wonderful job communicating a lovely,<br />heart-wrenching story, and I know my thoughts about WWII have changed<br />as a result. (And my desire to visit Great Britain has only<br />increased!!)  This is a captivating story about love, self-sacrifice, and post-WWII England, and I highly recommend it.
B000I2JDEY|3.0|So many great reviews here that I think my expectations were too high. The performances were amazing, but the action and dialog seemed too theatrical at times (not surprising as this was originally a stage play. I agree with another viewer that it felt overlong. And the denoument (no spoiler here) seemed quite contrived. Still, a classic for its time and place, and undoubtedly a breakthrough in film.
B000LE1GVW|5.0|WOW!! AND DOUBLE WOW!! What a great new talent, i first heard new shoes not knowing who was singing it but loved the song. Looked it up and bought it on amazon. There is nothing i dont love about this cd. From the first song to the last........ I have almost wore it out:) I am so looking forword to any new cds coming in the future.
0789318121|3.0|I picked this book up after watching the film, and it serves as a nice companion to the movie. If you're into film design or make-up, there are a few nuggets of information that you might find valuable by picking this up. However, what I bought the book for was the script. The script is the movie, and that has gotten me suspicious. Most film scripts you buy are just transcriptions of the movie put down in a screenplay format, not what was actually present on the set. Anyone who knows film knows that films rarely follow the script to the letter and this version was almost TOO close to the final film that something doesn't sniff right. What's worse is that lines of dialogue are accented just like they are in the film, lessening the script's credibility in my eyes. It's not bad to read the stage direction and the dialogue, so if you have to have a print version of \\"The Dark Knight\\" for your coffee table, you can do worse than this book.
B00018D44U|5.0|As a wonderful gift from my much more musically-astute son and daughter in-law, this was my first introduction to Norah Jones.  I'm now a fan.    Although the daughter of Ravi Shankar of '60's sitar fame, the Eastern influences she undoubtedly must have are not evident. All vocals, some covers, mostly her own excellent music and introspective lyrics (\\"What Am I to You?\\" is extraordinary).  Her presentation is unlike any I've heard exactly - slow, soft, low key, jazz-influenced, subtle.  A little country, but not much.   Slow tempos, almost rhythm-less, nicely paced.  Hard to define, seemingly many different influences, possibly even a stylistic throwback to earlier times, maybe the '30-'40's. Very far removed from rock or pop or up-tempo jazz, would not appeal to everyone.    Her clear, unadorned vocals are backed by a small, excellent, mostly acoustic (yes, and handsome!) band.  The recording is very well balanced, specifically not at all over-produced or commercial-sounding.      Very, very well done - not for the car sound system in traffic, deserves to be heard in a quiet environment on a good system, ideally with your soulmate.  An absolute breath of fresh air for good music lovers!
B000002LCK|5.0|The only Complaint is their best track/song ever   \\"dreams never end\\" was not included.

B0013527I4|5.0|Long time Muppet fans like me, who have taped some episodes back in the days, have long awaited for these restored and remastered DVD reissues to get ride of those old dusty VHS! I own all three sets, and they are fantastic! This one is no less.<br /><br />The Main Features: As you access the interactive menu, you'll face some funny skits by Kermit and Piggy. As we should and can expect from a Disney release, this set features all the 24 episodes of season 3, fully restored and shiny, and most important complete with UK skits.<br /><br />Bonus material: Altough video quality is very high, you'll notice audio skips and mutes from time to time. Even I have seen copies of the rare 1968 documentary \\"Muppets on Puppets\\" with full audio. The master original must have been damaged. But that's the only down point.<br />Then we have a set of vintage 1960s Purina Dog Chow commercials, with Rowlf and Baskerville, that are a treat to see, altough very short, and a featurette by the name of \\" A Company of Players \\", with interviews and such. Very interesting.<br /><br />Conclusion: Very recommended. If you are a Muppet fan and lover, this will bring back countless memories!
B0018QCXH8|3.0|\\"There Will Be Blood\\" Daniel Day Lewis performance is spectacular and captivating as a violent, selfish hell bent man with a death wish. Lewis's character desires to take all for himself regardless of the cost, making Scrooge look like a pansy by comparison. Lewis's performance is the only thing that will keep a couch potato watching this very slow movie to the very end. As I watched this film I thought surely acting this amazing is going to lead into a thick deep twisted move plot making my eyes open wide when all I could really think about while watching this movie was taking a nap. When the end of the movie came, my eyes finally open wide as I wondered what drug the writers of this script were on when this bad pointless going nowhere piece was written. The ending of this movie truly makes one feel \\"There Will Be Blood\\" was a complete waste of even a couch potatoes time. Daniel Day Lewis is a far better actor than the piece of junk screenplay given him. Seeing this boring movie in blu-ray did not help it much. For Lewis's outstanding acting alone, I give this movie 3 potato 4 potato. Couch Potato Michael
B00000DGUY|3.0|MONEY FOR NOTHING = NEUTERED!!!  It's about half of its original length and drastically edited.  The awesome build-up at the beginning is gone.  Get the original 'Brothers In Arms' album if you want 'Money For Nothing'.  The CD as a whole is good though.  I had to give it 3 stars though because the most famous track was stepped on.
B000QUEQBS|3.0|Mark Wahlberg (3:10 to Yuma) hits the mark as a good guy framed for an assassination after his military retirement as an expert sharpshooter. With a little help from his friends Wahlberg tries to prove his innocence accomplishing only a stalemate. When all else fails vigilante justice is the only option remaining. This movie is a mix of action flicks such as \\"Rambo First Blood,\\" \\"Bourne Identity\\" and Charles Bronson's, \\"Death Wish\\" series. The CGI is often poorly done so the eye catches it easily. The blu-ray edition leaves much to be desired as background images are often out of focus whereas they should be sharp. Other appearances include Danny Glover (Lethal Weapon) and Michael Pena, (World Trade Center), and veteran actor Ned Beatty. Even though there are flaws in quality, \\"Shooter\\" will still keep you well entertained. My rating, 3 potato 4. Michael Couch Potato
B00005JPNY|5.0|Pros:  Excellent story, amazing animation, fast moving, realistic story given that it seems to be based on a re-mix of our own history.  This is a replacement for Harry Potter since that story (movie sequence) seems to be wrapping up.    Cons:  This story is going to span about 3 movies which is a good thing if you don't mind waiting for the remaining films.

B00001ODGR|5.0|YOU MUST BUY THIS DVD IF YOU EVEN REMOTELY ENJOY THE ORIGINAL STYX. IT WILL NOT DISAPPOINT YOU !!!<br />I attended the Omaha, NE portion of this tour in 1996, which was the last tour with all of the original remaining members of Styx - DeYoung, Shaw, Young, & Chuck Panozzo (John Panozzo had passed away only two weeks prior; their emotional tribute to him was overwhelming). This DVD has become almost an homage to the band that my husband and I had grown up listening to. This is the REAL Styx!!!  We attended the newly put together band with the current lead singer, and it just isn't the same without DeYoung. You can't take someone THAT legendary and replace them and still call it STYX (i.e. Journey minus Steve Perry!!). This is the STYX for us diehard fans out there and is THE closest you will be to enjoying them live without being there. I truly hope they can bring this DVD to Blu-Ray as that would be the only thing that could improve this concert. Instead of seeing the current, or what we refer to as \\"PseudoStyx\\", we catch Dennis DeYoung in concert as much as we can. For a man who is now in his early 60s, he still has the pipes he had as a young man - just with gray hair now (but so do any of us who grew up with them!)<br />Thanks for taking the time to read my rambling review!  P.S. If you get the chance to see DeYoung in concert, TAKE IT - he usually performs most of the better known Styx songs with the local orchestra - it is phenomenal!! We met him May 3rd in Omaha with our 8-year old daughter (gotta pass down the good music to the next generation!) and he is everything you would want him to be. God Bless!
0786948523|5.0|I waited until I actually used the 4th Edition Monster Manual in play before commenting, but it has been an absolute dream. Overall this powerful tool allows for the rapid creation of interesting encounters. The inclusion of knowledge check data, encounter suggestions, tactics and the format is incredibly succinct. If your prep time is at a minimum I have to believe you will love this rulebook. Not only is it fast and easy, but I have yet to see a monster whether they be the old standard or something very new that is hum-drum. Everything has a twist that worked for my gaming group. I was able to engage a gaming group who've been playing since Gary Gygax wrote everything himself and that was just with the goblins. Nothing's perfect but this is a lot of fun to play.
B000E6ESL2|5.0|I've been reading several reviews on this movie and i've come to the conclusion that perhaps a lot of people have misinterpreted some things about it.  For one thing I think it would help watching the special features in the DVD extras.  In a short documentary about people who have near life experiences helped me understand more the reason for this movie.  It isn't just your plain old, cheesy twilight zone short. Firstly the visual aspects depicted in Stay (in my opinion) are not just for the sake of showing us how great the director is for his little tricks with the camera.  I find it to be what Henry Letham is imagining during his near death experience.  The scene changes are meshed together because its all his thoughts going through his head, like a movie.  During near death experience.  He's picturing his life through the eyes of those around him in those few moments while he is lying in the street.    I hope I was able to explain myself...this is my first review.  And I am by no means a film critic.  But I would just like to say that you should give this movie a chance... Regardless of the bad reviews.    I love watching this movie over and over again to try and figure out what each person in the show has to do with Henry.  But as a final thought, in  this day you have to admit, ya know, at least someone has actually come up with an original idea.  I'm so sick of all the movies coming out.  Remake after remake.
B0017I1FO4|2.0|I loved the first two albums, but this one is terrible.  It sounds like it was geared for females to listen to. There may be substance in the lyrics, but the vocals and music are just plain boring.  I'd rather listen to something like Hootie and the Blowfish, and I hate them!

B000RW3YYA|3.0|Season 3 of Stargate Atlantis, seemingly following tradition, is significantly worse than season 2. The storylines have become more contrived than ever, while the characters--although mostly unchanged--are bothersome. This is the Rodney season; even though there are only two Rodney-centered episodes, he is the one who always finds the answers, even to problems that others should solve instead.    Lt. Col. John Sheppard is Jack O'Neill Jr., as he was last season; even though he professed in season 2's `Coup D'Etat' that he `coulda been Mensa', he does anything but show it, instead working with the single talent of skillful piloting. Dr. Elizabeth Weir becomes almost paranoid in certain episodes; \\"They're trying to undermine me, Teyla!\\" she insists at one point--however, one can understand why `they' would try to undermine her, since there are times when she takes action instead of talking, as well as times when she insists on talking instead of taking action! Dr. Rodney McKay is his usual sunny self, condescendingly snapping at whoever disagrees with him. Teyla becomes almost useless in this season with barely anything to say; when she does speak, she is less than convincing. Ronon--reticent as usual--is the most likeable of all the characters, being the least changed from his original self. Dr. Carson Beckett, instead of being sincere as he was last season, becomes rather weak-willed at times.    The episodes:    No Man's Land--6 of 10--We pick up where season 2's `Allies' left off, with Wraith ships heading for Earth and the team trapped aboard them. The entire situation results in a brilliantly computer-generated battle. However, Col. Steven Caldwell, commander of the Earth ship Daedalus, gives us no reasons as to why he was chosen to command the ship; his tactics are less than stellar in several parts of the episode, such as when he wastes almost every single bomb that the ship has!    Misbegotten--5 of 10--Now that the Wraith on the hive ship have been turned into humans, the team dumps them on a deserted planet. Not one of Atlantis' crowning glories; after all, they should know that the Wraith can figure things out in minutes. Dr. Beckett is strangely foolish, while the others are simply stupid. All in all, this is a terrible ending to a potentially good cliffhanger.    Irresistible--5 of 10--In an obvious Star Trek imitation, the team comes upon a man--think Harry Mudd--whose fellow villagers simply adore him, even though he's a fool. Sheppard supposedly has a cold in this episode, although he demonstrates it rarely in the form of brief coughs and sneezes. Because of the very irritating nature of the man they meet, this episode is less than it could be.    Sateda--8 of 10--A figure apparently from Ronon's past brings him to his now-dead homeworld, forcing him to play a deadly game while looking against his will into his tragic and bloodstained past. Even with the surprising lack of explanations, this episode has movie-style action that never fails to thrill. We also see a long-lost scrap of Ronon's past, giving us a peek into his character.    Progeny--6 of 10--The team dials an address--which the Ancient database specifically said not to dial--and finds an advanced civilization that is much more than it seems to be. Unfortunately, this episode isn't as good as it sounds, because of the simple fact that the advanced civilization is based on something that has already been done in Stargate SG-1. It's true that some viewers haven't seen SG-1, but nonetheless I can't enjoy episodes featuring storylines that have already been used, especially in the original Stargate show.    The Real World--7 of 10--Dr. Weir wakes up in a mental hospital and is told that her entire life is a product of her imagination. This hoary old chestnut of a story has been done in Smallville, Star Trek: The Next Generation, and even The Dead Zone! However, the treatment of this episode makes it fairly enjoyable.    Common Ground--6 of 10--Sheppard iscaptured by an old nemesis, and is fed upon by a Wraith bit by bit. If it weren't for the identity of the nemesis, this story would be good. Nonetheless, the person who captures Sheppard was once a very interesting character, until he was changed to be the usual villain with the usual demands. For any fans of his, this is disappointing--especially since Sheppard is captured by way of a harpoon shot into his bulletproof vest!    McKay and Mrs. Miller--5 of 10--Rodney's sister Jeannie comes to Atlantis to help the former out. This episode is bad for two simple reasons: 1) The entire episode is based on another episode that ended in disaster and 2) Jeannie is equally as annoying as Rodney in a different way. She tells all and sundry that Rodney's real first name is Meredith, making him the butt of jokes, and teases him immensely; of course, Rodney doesn't take kindly to being teased, and makes everyone else's lives miserable by being twice as surly as usual. If it weren't for that, this episode would be at least bearable but, as usual, Rodney wrecks it!    Phantoms--8 of 10--One of the better episodes--the team finds a suspended Wraith experiment, which then makes them hallucinate all sorts of things, most of which are dredged up from the backs of their minds. There are some times when even the viewer can't distinguish between fantasy and reality, which keeps one on the edge of one's seat.    The Return, Part I--6 of 10--The Daedalus finds an Ancient ship traveling as fast as it can towards Atlantis, and helps the crew get back to the city. There, the Ancients proclaim that anyone and everyone living there are not needed whatsoever and should leave, as fast as possible. Of course, this results in retrospectives for the main characters and annoyance for the audience--basically, the Ancients think that, just because they have more control over the city, they can kick out the humans there. The only satisfying part of this episode is when the Ancients get their just desserts.    The Return, Part II--6 of 10--Now that enemies have taken over the city, Sheppard and friends must take it back. Yet another episode where they have to clean up the Ancients' mess! The plans they make to take back Atlantis are not half bad, but one can't help but think of what would've happened if the Ancients hadn't come around in the first place...    Echoes--4 of 10--Teyla sees strange figures wandering the halls and must find out who and what they are. This episode has the potential to be an intriguing mystery, but one thing puts a damper on it--everyone believes that the Ancients are trying to warn them of something! The Ancients have never warned anyone of anything, but according to our friends in the city, they have suddenly begun to worry for humans and are now wandering around purposefully, speaking a foreign language. It's very implausible that everyone would believe such a thing, given the attitude of Ancients in the past.    Irresponsible--4 of 10--The team runs across Lucius (Harry Mudd II from `Irresistible'), and finds that he's gotten himself into more trouble. If I were to choose between the two episodes, I would without doubt choose the first one--Irresponsible is terrible. The enemy who appears is amazingly dislikeable, even more so than his other appearance in `Common Ground', and Lucius is a pale, annoying version of Harry Mudd.    Tao of Rodney--8 of 10--Rodney is changed by a device and becomes almost Ascended, with incredible mind powers. If the main character of this episode were Teyla, Ronon, or even Sheppard, this episode would get a 10--the storyline is extremely interesting and has several touching moments. However, we all know by now that whatever happens to make Rodney a better person will never work, and so we watch this episode knowing that he'll be back to his usual self in the next one.    The Game--3 of 10--The team finds two villages that are part of an Ancient experiment, in which the people change their lives based on instructions from a console that is controlled by someone on Atlantis. It turns out that Sheppard and Rodney have each been `governing' one of the villages. This episode has extraordinary potential, but falls flat on its face. The leaders of the villages have horribly enhanced versions of Sheppard and Rodney's weak points; Dr. Weir suddenly becomes silent at the time when she is most needed; and, to make things even worse, the episode is resolved in a totally inexplicable manner! By far, the most awful of all season 3 episodes.    The Ark--4 of 10--The team finds an entire civilization locked within a stasis device, where they will rest, safe from the Wraith, until brought back into reality. Unfortunately, the people who are accidentally `resurrected' are the worst examples of the civilization--one is depressed and gets the team into almost irreversible trouble, whereas the other spends his time talking ceaselessly of the `ten thousand souls' that are in the device. Another episode with potential that was not utilized...    Sunday--6 of 10--Two scientists are infected with exploding tumors (thanks to yet another botched Ancient device) and in a race against time, Dr. Beckett must help them; every Atlantis fan already knows that this is Beckett's last and worst episode. The very event that dooms him is something that, with proper actions, he could have avoided! Naturally, the Ancients caused the problems here, as usual. Beckett's search for someone to go fishing with him, though, is an entertaining little piece that becomes bittersweet in the end.    Submersion--4 of 10--An underwater drilling platform is discovered near Atlantis and, while exploring it, the team is attacked by a Wraith queen. This is, quite frankly, a ludicrous episode--the queen, although not having fed for centuries, manages to swim near the seafloor under enormous water pressures. In the meantime, Teyla feebly lets herself fall into a very bad situation, unlike the warrior woman she's supposed to be. Those two points make the episode extremely weak.    Vengeance--4 of 10--Michael returns, this time experimenting with humans and Iratus bugs (the genesis of the Wraith). Since Michael is unsurprisingly a very gifted scientist, we in the audience can see it all coming. The people that he chooses for his experiment decided, for no apparent reason, to build their small and simple settlement upon a vast network of creepy abandoned tunnels. To top it all off, Sheppard has a chance to capture Michael and instead passes right by him. The only remotely good part of this episode is Ronon, who--when Sheppard tells him not to kill Michael--retorts by saying something to the effect of \\"No! He's caused enough trouble already, and I'm going to kill him this time.\\"    First Strike--5 of 10--The enemies from `Progeny' return, with a weapon designed to destroy Atlantis. This episode is crammed full of mistakes--Dr. Weir insists on using diplomacy when it's obvious that it won't work; the Apollo, a new Earth ship, arrives with a mission that does nothing but inflame the situation; Atlantis does quite a few things in an effort to escape from its pursuer, all of which simply serve to make things harder; etc. etc. I, for one, have no idea how anything will be resolved in the beginning of season 4.

0812550706|5.0|Wow. I am a junior in high school now and I am recalling from the time when I first had the chance of reading the series thanks to a recommendation. I was looking online actually for the Twilight series but the Ender's Game kept coming up, which compelled me to see if I can buy the series.   The series is PHENOMENAL. Which is why even after three years have passed, I have always kept thinking of these books. The storyline, characters, and the themes will STAY with you long after you have finished the novels. It will have an impact on the ways you see the world, but King does not push the \\"moral\\" I guess, in any way, shape, or form.  I ADORE this books. I think Orson Scott King is an absolute genius and would recommend it to anybody- regardless of what their opinion of Science fiction.
B000001EYO|2.0|There are some definite nuggets here, such as \\"Condition\\" and \\"Hotel California,\\" but there are also some VERY noticeable omissions, such as \\"Tumbleweeds\\" and CCR.  Also, some of the stuff on this album is a complete mystery to me.  I'm listening to it right now, and I can't remember for all the Kahlua in Mexico where some of these songs were in the film.  It would be nice to see an improved, 10th anniversary edition of the CD to go with the DVD, but things don't look promising.  I guess the licensing was too difficult for some tracks.  Basically, I'm glad I got this on ebay.
B000XTCBWS|5.0|I purchased the cycle as it appeared, beginning with SIEGFRIED. I have been able to compare it with cycles by Solti, Furtwangler (RAI), Kraus, Keilberth (1953), Knappertsbusch, and several individual recordings of the music dramas, conducted by Schuchter, Walter, Furtwangler, Leinsdorff, Bohm, Heger, Coates, Alwin, Elmandorff, Moralt, Knappertsbusch. In no way do find this 1955 cycle musically inferior to any of the versions mentioned above. I speak of musical/dramatic issues only, since the recording qualities vary widely across the board, as might be expected.<br /><br />One major advantage here is that Windgassen was in peak form, and had several seasons of the role (Siegfried) under his belt -- also true of Varnay and Hotter. One might almost regard this cast as a Bayreuth Repertory Company: experienced colleagues who had worked together for several seasons, and with a conductor they admired and respected.<br /><br />Whatever Testament's sins for releasing much sought recordings at exorbitant prices, we owe them a debt of gratitude for this excellent RING.
630528069X|2.0|I am so horrified by this movie that I cannot watch it! I saw it when I was a kid and liked it. But looking at it now, it makes me so upset!<br /><br />Just look at the cover! Doesn't it look like the World Trade Center just after the planes smashed into them? Yeah, I know it's just 1 building, but the angle of the building is just creepy!! Okay, the movie was good; lots of blood and swear words, but I just can't get the images of the Twin Towers falling down like a building collapsing with explosives!!  They should have a warning on the cover, saying something like:<br /><br />THIS IS NOT THE WORLD TRADE CENTER ON FIRE! THIS IS ONLY A MOVIE!<br /><br />I would like the movie more if they changed the box. But as it is, I can't watch it!!

B00005JPY0|2.0|Took my 14 year old niece to see this yesterday.  We both walked out of the movie shaking our heads, agreeing that there was two and half hours of our lives we will never get back.  I loved Heath Ledger, but I'm sorry, I don't think his performance here was anything to write home about, much less Oscar worthy.  The movie's plot line eventually goes off in a hundred different dizzying directions, totally confusing and boring this viewer. I found myself nodding off for two minute intervals throughout.  I'm giving it two starts for the special effects, but even they weren't anything I haven't seen before in other movies.  Maybe I'm just getting old and jaded, but this Batman seemed like a wimp.  I was especially disappointed to see that the Joker didn't die a horrible death as he deserved.  (At least they didn't create the impression that he got his due in this movie.)  I guess you have to be a die hard fan to really dig this stuff, or at least wanting for something to waste an afternoon on.  But the popcorn was good.  Whatever.
B000R7HY0K|3.0|... you're in for a humdinger of a ride.  Otherwise, just fast-forward through Texas and pick up the story in Tennessee.<br /><br />Here is Stuntman Mike, walking into a bar, looking for a girl he can entice into his killer car.  Seems Mike is a played-out stuntman with a grudge at the world, especially the distaff half, and he gets his jollies by killing them off in his very own Deathmobile.  Mike has a jacked-up stunt car that he's made practically impregnable on the driver's side but he's turned the passenger side into a death trap.  As at least one unfortunate young lady is going to find out, to her everlasting regret.  He also uses his car as a battering ram to demolish an oncoming car and everyone in it.<br /><br />When Tarantino is good, he is very, very, good, but unfortunately he's less than very good in \\"Death Proof\\".  The first half of the movie is a crashing bore.  The bar scene drags out interminably to no point.  None of the girls is remotely interesting.  Jungle Julia, played by Sydney Poitier, is a tiresome beeyotch who needs some attitude adjustment (maybe a backhanded slap across the mouth might help); Butterfly, played by Vanessa Ferlito, is just plain embarassing with her pathetic attempt at a lap dance, and the other two girls are just plain forgettable.  I can't even remember their names, that's how little of an impression they make on the viewer.  And Tarantino needs to retire Michael Parks as the small town Texas sheriff and Son Number One.  It was halfway funny in \\"Kill Bill\\" but it got old fast.<br /><br />Patched up and with the Killmobile lusting for more blood, Stuntman Mike moves to Lebanon, Tennessee, and the second half of the film is as fun as the first half was boring.  Mike runs into four more girls he'd like to feed to the death car, but these girls engage us in a way the four women in Texas never did.  They're fun and refreshingly free of attitude.  Rosario Dawson as Abernathy shows a nice sense of comedy, Mary Elizabeth Winstead is fetching as Lee, Zoe Bell (playing herself) shows some acting ability besides being a world-class stuntwoman (she was Uma Thurman's stunt double in \\"Kill Bill\\") and Tracie Thoms bring just the right amount of street into the role of Kim.  There's a lot of pointless chattering among these four as well, but unlike the first group, these girls are fun to listen to and we laugh along with them.<br /><br />Stuntman Mike wants to turn these ladies into car-fodder as well, but turns out he's messed with the wrong women this time.  These chicks know how to give as good as they get and then some.  The last twenty minutes of the film are a wild ride with a bang-up ending, literally and figuratively.  (I did think Dawson's high-kick coup de grace was just a tad over the top, but that's a minor cavil.)  Ole Mike might want to consider taking up needlepoint as a hobby in his declining years.<br /><br />The second half of the movie almost makes up for the deadly first half, but the first half is bad enough to make me give his film three stars instead of four.  There are plenty of car chases and car crashes, severed limbs and blood and gore throughout the film to satisfy the horror fans, but when all is said and done, it's not enough.  The main problem with \\"Death Proof\\" is that, in the end, it's only half a movie.<br /><br />Judy LindBell (playing herself) shows some acting ability besides being a world-class stuntwoman (she was Uma Thurman's stunt double in \\"Kill Bill\\") and Tracie Thoms bring just the right amount of street into the role of Kim.

B00000IFWE|4.0|Tom Petty took a long time between his 90's albums. [[ASIN:B000002MUN Wildflowers]] was in 1994, [[ASIN:B000002OH3 Into the Great Wide Open]], the last album with The Heartbreakers came out in 1991. For only the third time in the decade, Petty mustered up an album of new material and headed back to the studio, again (as on \\"Wildflowers\\") with producer Rick Rubin. Once more. Rubin guided Petty through music that appears natural, unforced and from the heart.<br /><br />The twist was that Petty was coming of a divorce with his wife of 20 years, and these songs reflect the turmoil in his life from the time. He has even gone as far as to say that he won't perform many of these songs again, as they're too painful for him to revisit. \\"Room At The Top\\" builds slowly, then cascades into a great Mike Campbell solo and Petty's dry vocal hits a boiling point. It's classic Petty and one of the best songs on this, maybe Petty's most under-rated album next to [[ASIN:B00005ABKB Long After Dark]].<br /><br />It is also, clearly, his most personal. \\"Wildflowers\\" often felt like Petty was delving into his personal thoughts, but songs like \\"One More Night One More Day\\" drip with sadness and pain. This is a diary of a life coming undone, in the way Phil Collins' [[ASIN:B000002I8D Face Value]] or Richard and Linda Thompson's [[ASIN:B000000612 Shoot Out the Lights]] made brilliant cathartic art from relationship pain. There is hurt (the title song, \\"Rhino Skin\\"), anger (\\"Go Down Swinging,\\" \\"Free Girl Now\\") and a nostalgic wish for better memories (\\"Accused Of Love\\"). The songs on \\"Echo\\" are easily the most consistent since [[ASIN:B000002O5L Full Moon Fever]], with the production striking a balance somewhere between Jeff Lynne's and the oft-times too laid back pace of \\"Wildflowers.\\"<br /><br />\\"Echo\\" is an album of heavy substance. There are moments of brief humor (\\"Swinging\\") but just as often, a certain surliness underneath the rockers - \\"I Don't Wanna Fight\\" could easily be his best kiss-off aside from [[ASIN:B00005ABK8 Damn the Torpedoes']] \\"Don't Do Me Like That\\" - belying the Heartbreakers' usual tight and muscular playing. Had this been earlier in his career, my general thinking is that this would have been maybe two songs shorter and heralded as a masterpiece. Regardless, \\"Echo\\" is an album of such complexity and emotion, that it stands head to head with Petty and The heartbreakers' best.B00005ABK8 Damn the Torpedoes']] \\"Don't Do Me Like That\\" - belying the Heartbreakers' usual tight and muscular playing.

B000XA5K48|3.0|If you're a romantic of Hong Kong action films, Guy Ritchie knock offs, Sin City and mindless mayhem, or just a video game junkie - then Shoot 'Em Up might just be for you.  Gratuitous violence and lots of bullets - this is shot by Crouching Tiger alumni Peter Pau - and dourly acted by the capable Clive Owen.  The other reason to watch this modern film noir cum comic movie is Italian Goddess Monica Bellucci, who amazingly, plays a hooker with a heart of gold - yet again! (the third movie I've seen of her in this role).  Clive Owen doesn't have a real sense of humour though - he often reminds me of Timothy Dalton doing James Bond: serious and all business, without a hint of irony - a bloke's bloke.  That kind of works in his favour for this shooting spree, but don't expect much by way of characterisation, this is just bang bang bang.

B000EBD9TY|5.0|Elia Kazan's \\"Streetcar Named Desire\\" is a wonderful interpretation of William's classic play.  Like many of Tennessee William's plays \\"Streetcar\\" depicts the moral ruination of the post-civil war South.  Blanche Dubois, in particular, is tragic and represents a \\"belle idee\\" gone hopelessly wrong.  We learn how she has tried but failed to hold the old family home and honor intact.  As a school teacher in Oriole, Mississippi she has failed in the most terrible way possible.  She has not only prostituted herself but has seduced young school-age boys.  As a consequence, despite her faded aristocracy, she has been run out of town and wound up on the doorstep of her sister, a woman quite content to reach for the gutter.<br /><br />Her Pollack brother-in-law, played by Marlon Brando, is so miserable that he's great.  He takes every opportunity to insult his freeloading sister-in-law and--with his wife in the hospital having a baby--he plumbs the depths of his own depravity and rapes the frightened and increasingly confused Blanche.<br /><br />Blanche, who had a fleeting opportunity to marry the naive Karl Maldon, sees her opportunity torn away from her when Maldon learns the black truth of her Oriole history.  Blanche retreats into madness.  She finally meets her aristocratic savior in the form of an elderly physician who arrives to take her to a mental institution.  \\"No one\\", as Ray Charles sang, \\"is saved.\\"  The film is beautiful in its horror.<br /><br />Ron Braithwaite author of novels--\\"Skull Rack\\" and \\"Hummingbird God\\"--on the Spanish Conquest of Mexico

I enjoyed this season because I had missed this entire season when it first aired on the WB; so I loved watching how Stars Hollow came to life.  Then there is Max, wow he is an amazing guy.  Now I know what the Friday night dinners are all about.  The blind date was hilarious.  There's Gran, wow what a character. Then Dean, yep the Dean, he is such a wonderful boyfriend to Rory (he is every mother's dream boyfriend for their daughter).
0789318121|3.0|I saw this at the book store and have to admit I was severely disappointed.  The first reviewer mentioned there were about 65 pages worth of artwork, but it felt a lot less.  It seemed like each page only had 1-3 pictures.  The artwork was also rather bland.  It's similar to the Batman Begins one, so if you've seen that you know what kind of style to expect.  In fact, if you've seen the movie, this book is basically unnecessary.  The Nolan movies are more realistic, so the artwork is less \\"fantastic\\" unlike the Burton/Schmacher movies which had great artwork (if you can find it) regardless of the quality of the movies.  There was nothing in the book that I felt awed about.  I felt like I had seen everything already just by watching the movie.        Then there's the script.  I felt this was more of a script book than an artbook.  Though I found it entertaining trying to do my own interpretation of the joker with the script right in front of me!    It's a nicely designed product.  It's just too bad there's not much in it.  Get it if you're a hardcore completist.  Pass if you want to show it off as a coffee table-type of book.

B001CQONKY|5.0|Warning: slight spoilers ahead.<br /><br />You'd figure that for a show going on it's eighth season (a season shortened by the WGA strike to boot) that things would get a bit stale to say the least, especially considering the horde of network TV imitators to pop up since it's original inception.  Fear not, C.S.I. still manages to keep going strong, and it picks up by grabbing the viewer by the throat and not letting go either.  Grissom (William L. Petersen) and his team race against time to find and save Sara (Jorja Fox) as her life hangs in the balance, which eventually leads up to her departure from Vegas, as well as a heartbroken Grissom.  Things don't get much better for the crew as Catherine (Marg Helgenberger) receives a threat, and Warrick's (Gary Dourdan) life begins to spin out of control, leading him to be charged for murder, and concludes in the explosive season finale which only promises more changes to come.  While some moments may come off as a bit hackneyed, C.S.I. manages to still be spectacular thanks to the depth that the principal characters get in this eighth season.  Even lab-man Hodges (Wallace Langham) gets an episode to shine as he and the lab techs play some \\"murder games\\" in the inventive episode \\"You Kill Me\\".  There's also a crossover with Without a Trace, as Grissom and FBI Agent Jack Malone (Anthony LaPaglia) team up to solve a murder and kidnapping.  All in all, C.S.I. still manages to wonderfully deliver the goods even in it's eighth season, and still remains the best prime time, network TV crime drama on the air today.
B001AW9DKK|5.0|The majority of reviews focus on the music with one sourpuss patriot in Nashville.

B00005JPY0|5.0|Warning: some spoilers ahead.<br /><br />Superhero epics rarely get better than The Dark Knight, a sequel that not only outshines Batman Begins, but completely obliterates it.  Christian Bale returns as Batman/Bruce Wayne, and soon learns that the warning Jim Gordon (Gary Oldman) gave him at the end of Batman Begins about escalation was ever so true as the psychotic Joker (the late Heath Ledger, in a brilliant and Oscar worthy performance) makes an impact on Gotham City's criminal underworld.  In his personal life, Bruce also finds his true love Rachel Dawes (Maggie Gyllenhaal, replacing Katie Holmes) in the arms of new district attorney and Gotham's proclaimed \\"white knight\\" Harvey Dent (Aaron Eckhart), who swears to clean up the corruption running rampant in Gotham; no matter the cost.<br /><br />Epic in scope with brilliant direction from Christopher Nolan (whose orchestration of an opening bank heist is nearly flawless), The Dark Knight takes us places that superhero or comic book-based films rarely take us.  It's an intelligent, dark, and surprisingly violent ride that features wonderful performances from nearly everyone involved, and the handling of Dent's tragic descent is as memorable as almost any thing else featured in the film.  However, it is the performance of Heath Ledger that really puts The Dark Knight on such high a plateau.  Ledger's Joker is by and far the best treatment of a villain you will ever find in a comic to film adaptation: he's sickly funny and incredibly frightening in a performance that truly is for the ages.  Bale himself seems more comfortable in the role of Batman, and is by far the best Caped Crusader to grace the screen.  Eckhart is fitting as Harvey Dent, and his tragic transformation into Two-Face is, as said before, respectful and believable.  Everyone else, from a returning Michael Caine as trusty butler Alfred and Morgan Freeman as the brilliant Lucius Fox, are small miracles by themselves.<br /><br />All in all, The Dark Knight is certainly the best Batman film to ever see the light of day.  So good in fact, that one will wonder just how Christopher Nolan and co. could be able to top it.  With a downbeat ending that sets things in a new and different direction for Batman and his crusade against crime, who knows?  The best may still be yet to come.est Batman film to ever see the light of day.  So good in fact, that one will wonder just how Christopher Nolan and co. could be able to top it.

B00079FUI6|5.0|Great show(excluding season two), great season! This show is so well written, there were times i thought i knew the answer to their mystery and another curve ball would be thrown our way. The comedy comes from the fact that they \\"immate\\" soap opras, and do a great job with it. not to mention the funny things that happen to teri hatchers character. The first season is one of the best first season out of any show i have seen. Something i sure did look forward to every week, and ended up buying season one to watch it all over again. What i really like about this show was the great cast and how they work very well together. you maybe surprised by the acting. Sit back and enjoy the ride because you're in for a lot of turns and twists in this great season. i highly recommend it.
0061537934|5.0|Wow; what an emotionally powerful and insightful book that will stay with you for a very long time (in the spirit of For One More Day by Mitch Albom.) The book leads you gently into the story and begins to tug at your emotions.  You will laugh and you will tear up and feel many emotions in between, but never in a sappy sort of way. Although the story is so much more than about racing, the main character is a race car driver.  Did not know anything about racing and had no idea such philosophical gems could be pulled out of it's nature. Told by a sweet loyal observant and philosophical dog, you will not be able to put down the book until you cry and then laugh at the end. Would not want to spoil the end, but it turns out the only way that it could or just the way things should. A must read - not only will you view dogs in a different light and profound respect, but you will be very glad that you were touched by this wonderfully told classic of a book.  What a talented author Garth Stein is to reach deeply into the reader's soul.
1594489505|5.0|I was with my Mom when she bought this book.  The day after she bought it she said, \\"I read three pages and then decided I don't have time to read.\\"  After finishing this book in 36 hours, I'm determined to force my Mom to read the rest.  It's always shockingly beautiful when a male author can sneak inside the minds of women and convey their emotions, feelings, joys and revulsion in a given situation.  Though this sounds \\"un-politically correct\\" in this day and age, it's equally surprising when the minds of the female characters can connect to the mind of their male author. I would say that I felt \\"empathy\\" towards these women.  But empathy implies that my experiences drawn on those similar to theirs and this couldn't be further than the truth.  Furthermore, the explanation for the reasons behind the twisting, turning lives of Laila and Mariam wouldn't be complete without the supporting characters whose scary, nauseating, beautiful traits intertwine with their lives.  They are all multidimensional.  So much so that I felt that if I closed my eyes and reached out my hand, it would intertwine with theirs or it would land with a vicious \\"smack\\" on a deserving face.  Buy this book, take a deep breath and don't plan on putting down for the next two days.
B0013LPS8E|5.0|At this point in time, there are already enough reviews on the album itself... many much more well-written and informed than I could ever hope to write.  And also at this point in time, you have probably already heard or purchased this album in one of its various forms if you are looking at possibly buying the new remastered version.    So the question is not \\"Is this an album worth buying?\\" because we already know it is.  The question is \\"Is this album worth re-buying?\\"    The answer: yes, it is.  The remastering of War makes it go from sounding like a record to sounding like you are in the studio hearing it live for the first time.  And it's breath-taking... it really is.
B0002Z9HT8|5.0|This video set brings back a flood of memories of the 1980s upbeat times. Its a piece of nostalgia you would'nt want to miss. This was one exciting time. It brings back some poignant memories (for example, Princess Di appearance at the inaugral and Freddy Mercury's incredibly powerful performance). The early 1980s was an incredibly creativite and upbeat time. Live Aid 1985 was at the pinnacle of those times.    Its too bad that the producers of this DVD set omitted 6 hours of concert time. Their ostensible reason was that the tapes were lost. Well they should have asked me, because I recorded much of it live over the air (I was in India at that time), and remember recording tracks like \\"You're the best thing\\" (the Style Council) which were omitted. I find it hard to believe the producers could not find the tapes. It seems some of the tracks were deliberately cut to make the distribution fit in 4 DVDs.
B000SFZ05C|2.0|Before I get to Born Into This, I must get something out of the way that bothers me about this great band: one reviewer stated about the 1994 album that The Cult doesn't have an ear for their own best tunes. I agree. For most of their albums, they leave off tunes I consider better than the ones to make the cut, and I am left scrambling for the imports or singles. It happened as early as Dreamtime(Bonebag is a great tune and should have been on the US version), likewise for Love (I LOVE Little Face, but it's only on a rare pressing), Electric, when The Manor Sessions were first recorded (Love Trooper and others from Manor are among my all time faves of theirs), it happened again with BG and E (Libertine was amazing), and, yes, it happened again for this album. In my opinion, Stand Alone and War Pony Destroyer are the two best songs and most Cult-like that only made the Savage Edition. Something MUST change!    Now, to this album. As others have stated, the band is tight and plays well as a unit, but we have a lack of composition here. Something is just missing. There is energy. Energy needs to be harnessed and directed. That added touch that defines vintage Cult isn't present. There are hints of potential, but it's ultimately a misfire. Billy's leads are sparse; I only counted 3 songs with any soloing. Lest' the boys not dare follow Metallica's St. Anger goof of no solos! The drums are a bit hollow, too. Even Ian's lyrics could use some catchier choruses. Some nice bass lines, but that's it. Chris Wyse is the best bass player they've had in a while. Ian was proud of the quick studio time it took to cut the tracks. True, 2 years in the studio to over produce is not good, but neither is a 2 month rush job when the band has 2-3 singles and decides to make a full album. What matters is the final product, and it just isn't quite up to this great duo's standards. If War Pony Destroyer and Stand Alone were included and a couple of the lesser tunes axed (Dirty Little Rockstar, Citizens, Holy Mouintain), we'd have a little more promise here.    Beyond Good and Evil was red-hot, but this one's a little pink. More time in the fire, Ian and Billy. You can do much better!
B00127RAJY|5.0|I absolutley loved this video!!! I think Jillian is awesome and the 20 minute workout was so easy to fit into my day..mind you the workout wasn't easy but it was great..all three levels were great!!I would recommend this video to everyone allong with all of Jillian's DVD's.
B000002UUH|5.0|While I was in Malibu, I got a call from Captain Ahab to come to Plymouth, Massachsetts. Since he was paying for the accomodations and travel cost, I was more or less indebted to go. He said that while I was in America, it would be good to take in the sights on the West and East Coasts. I suppose he was right, but my Seer instincts sensed an ulterior motive.<br /><br />Anyway, he met me at Logan Airport and we drove south. I couldn't help marveling how much he looked like Gregory Peck. The again, it could have been ZZ Top. Must be the long beard. \\"I have a surprise for you my Seer friend\\", he said with glowing but vengeful eyes. \\"Oh, What would that be\\"? I asked. \\"Matey, we is going on a whale watch today! Shiver me timbers!\\" he gleamed. Needless to say people, I was in yet another sad situation. Yeah, you got it. Your beloved Seer was harpooned again.<br /><br />I really can't complain (though I sometimes do) because it was a hot, beautiful summer's day. Just the right kind of day to take in the cooling ocean wind. When we were far enough out to sea, we saw the whales. Droves of them, flipping, jumping, having a jolly old time. I was amazed. Of course, I had to turn down my hearing aid because children were screaming with glee everytime one appeared. (I also found a lollipop stuck to my Seer's cape much later). Ahab? Well, they threw him in the brink for trying to board with weapons of mass destruction. ;)<br /><br />You are probably wondering by now what all this has to do with The John Lennon Collection? Well, absolutely nothing. But, it is a good story. However, in all seeriousness (who? me?), I started to write this review on the way back. So, if it's hard to read, blame Ahab or the boat.<br /><br />All in all, this is a pretty fine collection of his post Beatles work. Of course, John had many more songs that didn't make the cut. And those should be explored by picking up his individual c.d.s. In any event, many of these songs are essential to any considerable pop/rock archive and thus, it more than deserves the 5 star rating.<br /><br />When I think of John Lennon, I think of his contribution to the Beatle's tunes. Essential, genius, and undeniably one of the greatest songwriters of the 20th century. This holds true into his solo work as well. You get the beautiful Utopia of \\"Imagine\\" and the classic holiday treat of \\"Happy Xmas (War Is Over)\\" (which, to my mind, is way more superior to McCarney's offering).<br /><br />There are many aspects to his music to consider here. He continues his early rebel stance sound with \\"Instant Karma\\", \\"Cold Turkey\\" and \\"Power to the People\\". Still, in the roughness he still puts forth the wisdom that \\"We all shine on, like the moon, the stars, and the sun.\\"  Well, as my devoted fans know, most of my lectures include this belief.<br /><br />The rocker John appears in such tunes as \\"Whatever Gets You Through the Night\\", \\"Stand By Me\\" and \\"(Just Like) Starting Over\\". And, let's not forget the more sleek, soulful John on \\"I'm Losing You\\". The amazing thing I found out while listening to this is that most people equate love ballads with McCartney instead of John. This is not exactly true if you listen to his heartfelt offerings of \\"Love\\", \\"Jealous Guy\\", \\"Woman\\" and the wonder of fantasy to his young son with \\"Beautiful Boy\\". I especially like the line \\"Life is what happens to you while your busy making other plans\\". How true John. How very true.<br /><br />In closing, there are still more depths and levels and sounds of his music to explore here. His soul really began to evolve if you listen closely. He was an artist who knew the value of finding love, seeking truth, and knowing what a human life was worth. This is a fine little collection to get and, even though not the most complete, it is still considerable. I miss you John. I think we all do.<br /><br />Now, I must go and bail Ahab out of jail. I had to use all the money set aside for my trip to meet his bail. So, if you see me hitch-hiking along the road please give me a ride. And, oh yes. Pay no attention to the harpoon. It's only Boston beer, after all. ;)<br /><br />Mind games-forever , your beloved Metamorphoto the harpoon. It's only Boston beer, after all. ;)    Mind games-forever , your beloved Metamorpho

B000NDI3SK|5.0|I viewed this brilliant series as a set of 4 DVD's and was stunned by the brilliance of Dr. Jacob Bronowski as a teacher. He deals with every subject imaginable, including scientific work which ordinarily, I would not have attempted to follow, but he makes it all so easy that you begin to feel quite clever and to wish that you'd had him as a tutor. The series was 3 years in the making with location filming in over 20 countries and I would energetically recommend it to anyone to broaden their knowledge and especially to those with children, who will, I promise, be fascinated by all the events which shaped the world as we know it...an absolute masterpiece!

B000PC6A3E|5.0|The Good Things<br />*Some good action scenes, especially at the end.  Special effects are very unique.<br />*Excellent filming style and cinematography.  It's a little choppy and weird, but also very detailed and vivid.  Also very dark, moody, and realistic.<br />*Storyline is great, and makes perfect sense as long as you pay attention.<br />*Less emphasis on outlandish bad guys and gadgets and stuff and greater emphasis on fighting crime on the streets and doing actual police-type work.<br />*What gadgets Batman does have are realistically introduced.  There is a logical explanation for everything he has and where it all came from.<br />*Characters are phenomenal.  Bruce Wayne's evolution from a fightened boy to a hardened fear-inspiring crime fighter is very convincing and deep.  Acting is good.<br />*In conjunction with the characterizations, this movie also has very strong themes about fear, destiny, and human preserverance.  This film was way heavier than I would have ever thought.<br />*Excellent music.<br /><br />The Bad Things<br />*A little slow for the first hour or so.<br />*Some fight scenes are so choppy and fastly-cut that they are hard to really see (but it is a more intense style).<br />*If you're looking for the classic campy Batman, this is definately not it.  May be too dark and serious for some people (but this is probably more closer to what Batman was originally like).<br /><br />This is the darkest, deepest, most serious version of Batman yet.  It is also closer to what Batman should really be like, and above all, has some very deep meaning in the character that I would have never caught onto before (Bruce using his own fear to instill fear into others; fear is a very strong theme throughout).  It is surprisingly complex, but the dialogue and acting makes it all very understandable.  And of course, the plot is great and ties everything together into one complete circle.  Combined with a strong visual style, this is definately one of the best superhero movies made to date.<br /><br />If they keep this up, I seriously hope that they will turn the \\"Knightfall\\" comics into a movie too...<br /><br />All versions of this movie have good video and audio quality (great on Blu-ray, naturally).  The one-disc version has a trailer.  The two-disc has a bunch of featurettes and a funny MTV movie awards skit.  The Blu-ray disc has all of the same plus the first six minutes of the \\"Dark Knight\\" (filmed with an IMAX camera!).riously hope that they will turn the \\"Knightfall\\" comics into a movie too...

B001AW9DKK|5.0|It seems folks have had a LOT to say about the politics of<br />this CD, sooo...let's get to the MUSIC!!! The album starts off with a rousing<br />acapella version of Crosby's \\"What Are Their Names?\\" from his first solo<br />album released in 1971.This song is STILL relevant.Neil has created<br />a \\"Living with War\\" piano introduction that was not on his album of the same name.The melody without the vocals is very haunting and should<br />add greatly to the film(which I have NOT seen). There are eight songs from LIVING WITH WAR and seven various CSN songs.It proves to be a good mixture.The threesome add a lot to Neil's LWW songs and he, in turn, adds his muscular guitar tones to their songs.When  the\\"Wooden Ships\\" intro comes on,Crosby does a fantastic job on his part.I wait to hear Stephen and then....NO STILLS!!! It's  Nash who sings Stephen's part!!!That was a little disappointing... but the song still worked. When Stills sang \\"For What it's Worth\\"  he sounded fine but the mix on his vocal was so low I had to work to hear it. There wasn't a problem hearing the mix on his guitar playing...he sounded like the legend he is.As the soundtrack to the film of the same name,this release serves up more music than the film  probably will.Lucky for us.As someone else wrote recently,these songs make you think.When's the last time music made you do that?
B000065LZE|5.0|This album ROCKS, with a capital R.  John Bonham's drumming is the best.  Every song on here is awesome, especially Rock and Roll, and Stairway To Heaven.  Another Great song is When The Levee Breaks.  It is no wonder that so many rock fans, and magazines consider it to be one of the greatest rock albums ever made.

B000003CMD|5.0|I bought this album a couple of years ago, and I believe it is the greatest Southern Rock album out there.  Lots of jamming from guitarist Dickie Betts.  Ramblin Man is one of my favorite songs ever made (along with Stairway to Heaven, Echoes, Strange Magic, and Love Reign O'er Me).  I highly recommend this album to any Southern Rock Fan.
B0013FNC38|3.0|I had high hopes for this album after hearing \\"I'm yours\\" - which is a beautiful, simple song that is very reminiscent of his early work. After listening to the whole album, I found myself extremely disappointed.    It seems like ever since Mr. A to Z, Jason is making music for someone other than himself, and that he has gotten a tremendous amount of pressure to 'refine' his sound. This just means that he has lost the creative freedom that made his music free and flowing, full of entertaining lyrics and beautiful raw melodies (Check out his very first CD, live at Java Joe's). He has been crapping out music ever since his first official album 'Waiting for my Rocket' which was a wonderful blend of his personality and his producer's demands.    I think if he dropped a few band members, or heck, if he even remixed his new music in order to drop out some trumpets and percussion and background hoo-ha, then it might almost reach the simple beauty of what he used to make.     I still have faith in Jason that he will eventually realize that being a sell-out isn't worth it.
B00005JPY0|4.0|What can I say? Is it an improvement over Batman Begins? Absolutely. But is it the greatest motion picture ever made?<br /><br />You're kidding, right?<br /><br />As a life-long fan of Batman, from reading the comics in the late 70's & early 80's, to watching reruns of the 60's show, through the movies of the 90's, finishing with the Nolan revival film of today, there's no doubt that Batman is one hero no one can deny. Each one of his many incarnations have had value to me and The Dark Knight is no exception. But to me, is it the \\"be all, end all\\" of Batman films. Well, I guess it could be if that's what you're after.<br /><br />Truth be told, I found this as much \\"fun\\" as Batman Begins. From the realistic robbery beginings to the depiction of corruption within a police force, this movie to me played out like \\"Batman:The True Story\\". Gone was all the flash and spectacle of the original films, replaced with a feel of realism that made you almost frightened to see it. I guess it's just a sign of the times, with the whole world outside the theatre on a forever terrorist alert, that the film take on that vibe on as well. But don't I go to movies to escape that?<br /><br />Heath Ledger was good in this, yes better than Jack Nicholson, but was the performance Oscar worthy? Again, to me, no. In fact, if I didn't see the Joker make-up on his face, I would have assumed he was any generic killer/bad guy from a '00's film wanting to destroy the world in his terrorist-like path. Bale did his usual Batman part just fine, letting the suit do most of the talking, but is it me or does this guy need to reach in his utility belt for a bat-cough drop quick? And as for Aaron Eckhart's Harvey Two-Face, I thought he was great in the part, up until he actually became Two-Face, because through all his portrayal of good guy Dent, I kept wondering how could he go that crazy, dead girlfriend/burnt face and all? Oh, and I almost forgot, why was S*******w in this again? Guess they still have a few toys left over that didn't sell from the first film.<br /><br />Other things I noticed was the lack of a musical score, replaced at times with the most annoying ambient \\"eeeeeeeeeeee\\" buzzing sound that I quite didn't get, but it did prepare me for some bad things acomin' as an audio cue. And honestly, a good 30 minutes of the film dragged like no tomorrow, and could have been taking out (especially the overseas part).<br /><br />But was I entertained? For the most part yes. The explosions were loud and well shot, the action when on the screen was very visual, and each actor took to their part like it really was them. But does it erase or tarnish my memories of the 90's films that didn't take the material as serious as TDK? No, not even close. Again, it's just a different era. This movie is a reflection of the current times, and these times are alot darker than they used to be and when it comes to Superhero movies, to be taken seriously appearently you need to get real damn serious, and The Dark Knight does in spades. But did it lose something in achieving this goal? Yes, because this movie was not \\"fun\\" in the least. Amazing, Visual, Expensive, Frightening, Action-Packed...all of these, but \\"fun\\"...no. Why so serious, Batman?<br /><br />Oh yeah, because the world's a cesspool and we're all swimming in it. Thanks for reminding me.<br /><br />Overall, as faithful as the Batworld created by Frank Miller's 1989 The Dark Knight Returns, and very riveting to see and hear. But when they added \\"Dark\\" to it's title, they were NOT kidding. Hopefully with Part Three they could lighten-up a tad. Just a little?

1416914293|4.0|This book seemed like much less of a mush of other books than the first one in the series did, which was a relief. It picks up shortly after the first book left off, with all the main characters just recovering from the wounds they sustained in the big fight against Valentine's Forsaken. Which brings me to my only major problem with this book: the timeline. Although we're told that it was August during the events of City of Bones, in this book it seems to be late fall (there's always a chill in the air). Clary wakes up and eats a doughnut on her way to meet Simon, and then suddenly it's late afternoon. And a few more occasions of missing time...    If you can ignore those inconsistencies, though, this is a good read. Plenty of twists and turns, and unexpected action. A few characters wind up not being dead a few too many times (an author can only pull that trick so many times before all the tension leaks away). And, although the book dragged in a few scenes (ok, Inquisitor, we get your point), I'll be waiting with a fair degree of anticipation of the (hopefully, since I don't think this story-line can last for more than one more book) last book in the trilogy.
B001AW9DKK|4.0|I'll ignore the politics of previous reviews, though the tour had strong (and for me postitive) political impetus.<br />The music overall is very good, clearly Neil's driving and the boys respond. The mix at some points seems a little muddy both for the guitars and harmonies; other times not.  And most of Neil's songs are straight up from \\"Living with War\\"; no reworks or extended jams a la Crazy Horse or 4 way street.<br />But what is here is good. Military Madness rocks and has two awesome (but short) Neil distortion workouts. I love Let's Impeach the Prez even if no different from studio. Deja Vu and Wooden Ships are resurrected magnificently. Crosby and Nash still sound great together!  Ships also has some great guitar interplay. For What It's Worth does get an overhaul, kind of bluesy and heavier,which I like. My favorite from \\"Living with war\\" is Roger and Out and it is faithfully recreated here. Freedom and Children are both excellent; vocals very strong.<br />I would love some more guitar workouts (Wooden ships is great but brief), but overall this is a solid release. CSNY might have lost 1/2 a notch, it ain't 1969, but they still deliver. PS - check out photos! Stills looks like holy Hell!!!
B0017I1FP8|4.0|As we learned from the Greeks most tales of heroes are also quite tragic and that is the main thesis of Christopher Nolan in his second version of the Batman saga.  It is also the tone of the latest collaboration of Hans Zimmer and James Newton Howard and their very dark score for The Dark Knight.  There is no need to quibble here, much of the music that is tied to Zimmer brings up echoes of other works (principally The Last Samurai and King Arthur), and that is almost expected.  Nevertheless,  there is much to be admired here and enjoyed, especially Zimmer's (and Howard's??) addition of percussion and rhythmic strings in places and some new thematic material by James Newton Howard that initially is tied to Harvey Dent but becomes more generally a tragic \\"heroic\\" theme for Dent, Batman, and the common love interest.  It is somber at times but also quite stunning.  One is also taken by the motifs for the Joker, not a circus theme here but tones that clearly indicate sheer dread, and outright madness.  Of course this score is an extension of the Zimmer/Howard music for Batman Begins, but there are abundant new twists and whole new motifs and themes to give it a life of its own.  There are still some complaints about the absence of a true Batman theme, but by now the short motif (almost a true leitmotif) created for the first film has become the musical signature for this interpretation and it does work.  In many ways this score is truer to the Batman tradition than the film itself...sorry, Chicago is a great city, but it is not Gotham (previous films got it better), and the film could have done with a bit of serious editing:  too much of one villain, and in the end one villain too many taking screen time away from Batman himself.  In the end the film and especially the music return Batman to where he will always belong, a solitary shadow in the dark of night.  The soundtrack is generally well produced (the titles of the cuts are now recognizable, but the order of themon the disc raises an eyebrow) with solid packaging (especially the \\"limited/special\\" edition option) by Warner/Sunset.
B00166QJRU|5.0|*Please note: This review concerns the 2008 Limited Edition box and was posted to the respective product page.  Beyond the music found within, this review details the physical appearance and material contents only of that original, specialized release.*<br /><br />Printed in Holland/EU [by EMI, though the product page now says Virgin US], this single-disc release should not leave you feeling abused by the high MSRP.  Beyond the CD itself, contained within a box you'll find a 14\\" x 9.5\\" repro poster, an LA Times music review from 1972, four b&w picture cards including the famous 'Starman' design, and copy of a signed photo, then a 16-page booklet with basic information and a few nice concert pics.  The final 2-page image of David Bowie & Mick Ronson is worthy of posterization.  A friend who also purchased this title informed me that his box featured a different number in red (to the right of the ticket on front), which would indicate a limited edition as expected.  I have not yet heard to what number this set is limited.<br /><br />The audio quality, arguably the best ever offered of this memorable set, lacks in audience chatter as fans of this recording had likely become accustomed.  That matters to some I understand, but for those that didn't care for it to begin with, it makes the performance even more enjoyable and personal.  The speed appears to be corrected, and this is significant because most original bootleg LPs of this gig ran too fast.  Simply put, this is Bowie and Ronson performing at their best.  A moment in time captured and packaged expertly.  It's an effort to which I am grateful.<br /><br />There is no Clockwork 'Ode To Joy' intro as most of us whom have heard this performance from several sources before come to expect.  And to be honest, I miss it.  It is replaced by a 12-second intro by KMET radio, the broadcast source of this recording.  Oddly enough, the mention of 'Ode' is clear on the KMET radio dub of whose hand-written info is reprinted on the back of the book insert.<br /><br />There are 17 total music tracks including the full 10:44 'Width of A Circle'.  No 'Ode', but nevertheless a great joy to hear in such quality.
0345410025|5.0|This book saved my career!<br />I was working 100 hours a week as an OB-GYN and needed to take my oral boards. I knew they would never ask the easy stuff- how to do a vaginal delivery. No, they were going to ask the crazy stuff. They did too, what anti-malarial drugs are safe in pregnancy, for example.<br />I had neither the time nor the energy to go over and memorize the hundreds of pages of notes I had gotten from my board review course.<br />After reading \\"The Memory Book\\", I was able to process and retain enough information to easily pass my exam. The techniques I learned have been very useful since. I can go to a party with twenty strangers and say goodbye to everyone by name. I'm now teaching anatomy and physiology, and I can remember lists of things so my lectures flow much better.<br />I suggest this book to all my students, as well as \\"Super Memory, Super Student\\" by the same author.

B000QXCOQE|2.0|Talk about something running out of steam. Was this guy being paid by the word? There was some incredibly repetitive stuff, and somehow it got moreso as it went along. I also object to the frequent Bible references. Cite some other things. Sure, even people who do not share the Christian faith might agree that Jesus was a great teacher. However, he's not the only teacher. The only footnotes throughout were to offer chapter and verse.<br />So, okay, there's decent ideas here. They could have been delivered more concisely. Additionally, why include a chapter about the five love languages and children? There's a whole additional book dedicated to that topic that the author is happy to sell. Not everyone is interested.<br />Yes, I'll find a way to adapt a few applicable things I've learned in my reading. One wants an investment of time to be worthy. I'd have felt the read was a more rewarding experience had I the meat to read, not filler, and would have been done reading it and onward to something else enriching. Or spending the time putting some of these ideas to use.<br />The questionaire at the end, useless in Kindle format. Miniscule text in low-contrast faded text. It cannot be read at all.<br />Overall, a high price to have paid for something that should have merely been a Readers Digest article. The book editor did not earn the paycheck.

0439023483|5.0|I posted this in a discussion thread, already about this book.    Suzanne Collins has a knack for telling a story that is filled with memorable characters facing impossible situations. With equal parts adventure and heartbreak, she paints a picture of humanity at it's best, and at it's worst. Compelling characters, vivid locations, action/adventure, and a world slightly off it's kilter, combine to give us another interesting storyline. After inhaling her Gregor the Overlander series as quickly as the books were written, and absolutely loving the ride, I was glad to see she has not lost her touch.     \\"The Hunger Games\\" is set in a futuristic society where two young people from each district (twelve in all) will battle it out to the death for the amusement of the citizens to watch on tv. This book will be released to the public in October 2008, and will be a multi-book storyline. No word on how many books are set to be part this series, as of yet - hoping for many!    Suzanne Collins remains one of my favorite young adult authors of all time. It was a total thrill to meet her, and get her to sign my copy of this book at the recent ALA Convention. As a school librarian to many avid readers desperate for the kinds of stories she tells, she is like a rock star to some of my students who gobble up every book she writes. Hope she is home now and working on the next book...which I am already impatiently waiting for!    Michelle

1416523359|4.0|You know how Stephen King will sometimes give us a big, epic, plot-driven story (\\"The Stand\\", for instance), but then conclude such a story with a fifteen or twenty page epilogue that's mostly about introspection, melancholy, poetic musings, and revealing flashbacks (as if the author  feels the need to give us a more subtle landing after five hundred pages of bombast)?  Well, anyway, \\"Lisey's Story\\" is like one of those epilogues stretched to an entire book length.  It's actually not bad, and there's even a little \\"plot\\" in the form of a psycho stalking the title character, but you're mainly getting the author in that \\"epilogue\\" mode.<br /><br />I actually listened to this book on unabridged audio, read beautifully by the actress Mare Winningham, so maybe that's why I'm being kind.  But, honestly, as long as you know you're not getting a visceral, plot-driven story like \\"Cell\\" or the \\"Dark Tower\\" books, you'll likely enjoy this tale of a writer and his demons, and the wife who is subjected to it all.
B00080ZG10|5.0|This really is the sort of film that inspires you to find out about the man behind the legendary film. This film is well crafted, well acted, well styled, beautifully shot and just plain well done. Scorsese freely admits to playing around with time lines, but to getting things \\"Emotionally\\" right, which I think is correct. The more you know about the lead topic, the less likely you are to be a nice in hindsight review ( Like I think Jude Law is abysmal as Errol Flynn since I am Tasmanian and Jude is as Tasmanian as Jack Daniels when playing Errol... he did not even try; Knowing a subject too well can be a handicap when viewing an artistic endeavour). Anyways, as a soaring, roaring emotional rollercoaster, the events such as the Flight with Cate and Leo in the plane is as passionate as anyone could hope to get. Its beautifully done. The DVD  commentary assists in an understanding of how this film was created, and the performances of the supporting cast is just brilliant. You will love this emotional tour de force, and enjoy exploring the passions of the screenwriters version of Hughes, and I hope it does spur you on to read more about the man himself who helped shape Film, Cinema and Aviation as we know it today
B0000630BT|5.0|Man, the boys must of taken some viagra and chased it with a crack pipe.  This is some heavy stuff.  Its really good throughout... and I think its one of the best Priest out there, and I love their older stuff.  I didn't think they would top SFV or SC but they have with this monster.  Awesome stuff.
B000G0O5N2|5.0|As the commentator who knows how to assess evidence of war films (and narratives: cf. Listmania on my list \\"Vietnam War\\"), modern (ie from the Vietnam War) and ancient (World War II ), I loved this film.<br /><br />The territory of the conflict that is still relevant to tribal rivalries against the backdrop of Islamism and corruption. The UN mandate in Somalia has unfortunately not changed the situation.<br /><br />The deployment of American forces is typical of those used in current conflicts (Iraq for example) with this spirit of superiority owned by the youth: little culture, a humanistic vision and invincibility. This vision will be shocked.<br /><br />The solidarity of brothers in arms is clear and honor is given to the two Delta Group NCOs Master Sgt. Gary Ivan Gordon and Sgt. First Class Randy Shughart ( see [...]) who sacrificed their lives to save a helicopter pilot wounded. They received the Medal of Honor by the US Congress.<br /><br />Very good movie.
1434609723|5.0|I think the Pollyanna novel is a book we should all read and learn from. Life is always hard, and we should be grateful for things that we have. Pollyana, a young girl who has just lost her father, does that in a soft way that encourages people to be glad, without completly condeming them for their bitterness. This \\"glad game\\" is not just for kids, its for adults as well.      Being thankful for the little things: family, freedom, and others is important, and we always take that for granted in America. I would recommend that you not listen to the nay-sayers about this noval, they seem like embittered happless people. They don't seem to understand that this book is teaching a vaulable lesson. Overlook them and read the book for yourself, you won't be sorry you did.
6304936362|5.0|It is a great war film. Living in a bomber raises a big shot of fears, true feelings lived by a crew for his latest mission in the bomber aircraft \\"Memphis Belle\\".<br /><br />What an adventure. A formation of bombers too early abandoned by hunters allies is attacked by German fighter then harassed by the flak.<br /><br />What images! Quilted German planes, sensations guaranteed when bushings from the side machine guns rain to the ground, when the  ventral turret no longer works, when the fire blasts in the plane ...<br /><br />Heroism in ordinary and in extraordinary actions. A beautiful film.
B0002EXH5E|2.0|I realize I need to update the reviews for one of my favorite bands of all time, Megadeth.  So I decided to start with the worst.    I just don't know where to start with this one.  This is when Megadeth were in the nadir of the bands career.  They were writing stuff that was the equivalent of throwing slop against the wall to see if they could get something to stick and get some airplay.  Megadeth was never a radio-band, so I guess one could make a case for this being the all-out attempt to sell out.  I give them respect for at least being musically up-front about it I guess.  They had clearly traded anything about them that made them great back in their heyday.  It's amazing that this is the same lineup that recorded \\"Rust in Peace\\".    You know, I believe in change.  Change is good.  However, one does not buy a Ferrari for the fuel economy and use it as an every day car.  One does not use COBOL to write 3rd person shooter games for the home computer market.  One does not clean fine wooden surfaces using Comet.  So please spare me the \\"I'm intolerant of change\\" horse****.  This is Megadeth, and there are certain things I've come to expect from this band.    I'm writing this review as I listen to the album for the 1st time in about 3 years.  I didn't listen to it much then, so it's like the first time for me.  I'm so excited!    By Track/(1 worst to 5 best)/BPM/Starting key    1 = Indescribably bad - an embarrassment  2 = Bad enough to skip the song while driving  3 = Ok as background music or in the right mix to support it  4 = Will skip tracks to play this song  5 = Will put the CD in to play this song    1) Insomnia(3)/144/A - Has violin? In a Megadeth Song? Lots of zaps and computer sounds - guitar is purely power-chords and is sometimes sampled.  Did I pick up the wrong album?  Hey... sorry to the change is good crowd.  Change is one thing.  Trading in your strong points to acquiesce to the sound of the day is another.....    2) Prince of Darkness(3)/132/D - This sounds like something off of Metallica 'Load'.  Has an overlong intro with some b.s. about being the Prince of Darkness.  Then we get treated to a 30 second interlude with some wierd sound effects and a violin playing - doesn't fit.  Mustaine's voice is at least as good as Hetfields'.    3/4) Crush Em(1)/120/F - Starts with a fabricated live shout and clap-along, good energy builder.  Ahhh but then..... the drum machine with a disco bass-line and a dance beat - Oh the humanity:(!  And what's that? A hollow body rhythm guitar playing a little ditty over the beat? Is Nile Rogers now the guitarist for megadeth??? At 4:50, it's exactly 4:29 too long.    5) Breadline(4)/126/E - Now this is more what we've learned to come to expect from the 90's era Megadeth - a good mid-paced pop number with clean vocals and some harmonies and keyboards and orchestral touches.  Dim memories of Vic Rattlehead are being blocked...... Actually not a bad song though.  Well constructed - kind of Megadeth meets AOR.  Strongest song so far, which isn't saying much.    6) The Doctor is Calling(3)/102/F# - So we have AOR Megadeth, NIN Megadeth, Bryan Adams Megadeth.  Now this is Alice In Chains Megadeth.  Has a straightforward arena-friendly drum beat.  Not much more to say about it....    7) I'll Be There(1)/126/D - Has a disco-drum beat and a poppy verse/chorus song structure.  You could almost see a video with Dave Mustaine in a jump-suit jogging in place smiling and singing the chorus with a bunch of clouds in the background.... scary.    8) Wanderlust(2)/84/D - Another generic arena-friendly rocker.  Goes half the song at 84, then goes double speed for the last minute.  It shocks me frankly.... this is probably the most musically talented lineup Megadeth has ever had, yet they feel comfortable pumping out this tripe.    9) Ecstacy(2)/132/D - The title gave it some hope, but alas..... Begins with sort of Hawaiian guitar strumming combined with some light water-guitar comping (or is that an electric piano? I can never tell....).  More verse-chorus fluff-stuff.    10) Seven(2)/162/E - Hey this one rocks! Well.. sort of.  Has the guitar going through what sounds like a talk-box set on low.  And there's a very competently performed set of soloes.  But what's this?  A swing beat - with organs?    11) Time (The Beginning)(2)/66/E - And now the circle is complete - Prog-rock! It even has the same drums as \\"Imagine\\" by John Lennon.  The track is appropriately named.  Time...... minute after minute........    12) Time (The End)(3)/84/E - Starts with an arena riff that's reminiscent of Queensryche.  Good guitar work.  I guess they wanted to give us a little reward for making it to the end.
B0002EXH4A|4.0|Notes on the remastered version -   This album benefits heavily from the remastering.  Gone is the muddy sounding guitars and the horrendously loud middle portion of the spectrum.  I don't hear many places where the songs were changed and my overall opinion of the album is still 4 stars, but it's definitely worthwhile to get the remaster. I read reviews where people say that the album has lost it's edge with the remastering.  Don't fall for it.  The remaster provides a superior mix in every way, and if Dave Mustaine had to re-record some of the parts - well - so much the better in my opinion.    (Review of non-remastered edition - will update after I've listened to the remaster)    This album was one of the first introductions I had to Thrash Metal (along with Master of Puppets and the Garage Days EP from Metallica), so I have fond memories of listening to it over, and over, and over.  I'm afraid that is going to slant my review upwards.    However, I really feel this is not a bad album, but it is plagued with lousy production that actually wasn't uncommon around the time it was recorded.  The drums are in the background and sound like they were triggers as opposed to real drums on some tracks. The guitars are too loud and have way to much echo on them, and the overall sound is that of a big metal room, and for some reason, the man behind knobs really pumped up the middle portion of the spectrum.  If you've heard Ozzy Osbourne's no rest for the wicked, you will see what I mean.  The whole affair comes off sounding like a worn cassette recorded too loud.     Outside of that, the music is played competently, but the musicianship isn't as pronounced as on other better Megadeth albums.  Mustaine shouts most of his lyrics.  The bass guitar is typically great - Dave Ellefson weaves gold from s**t with his bass-playing on a bad day.  The drums are typical thrash-style drumming done competently but are nothing special.  The guitars are very up-front and are clearly showcased.   That said, the guitar playing is nice.    My un-patented rating system for those who care:  1 - So bad, I had to stop the CD  2 - Makes you want to press the skip button  3 - Good filler in the right mix - unnoffensive  4 - Will skip to this song  5 - Will put the CD in to listen to this song    Got it? Got it.    1) Into the Lungs of Hell(3) - a standard 3/4 guitar riffing jam instrumental    2) Set the World Afire(4) - Starts (literally) with an explosion that sets off a chugging guitar riff which morphs into into an angry testament-like riff.    3) Anarcy (in the UK)(2) - Often cited as the symbol of all that was wrong with this album, I didn't think it deserved the embarrassing tag put on it, but it's an unexceptional remake of the popular Sex Pistols song at best.    4) Mary Jane(3) - A three part prog anthem - Starts with a 3/4 sludge, moves onto a mid-tempo jam, then ends on a fast thrash and shred-fest.    5) 502(4) - An adolescent anti-cop song, but one of the better songs on the album, definitely could have benefitted from better production.    6) In My Darkest Hour(4) - Unquestionably one of the better songs on the album, also featured on \\"Decline of the Western Civilization Pt. II\\".  It starts with a 3/4 anthem that creates a wall of sound under Dave Mustaine's angst filled lyrics, then goes into fast guitar riffing.    7) Liar(5) - 3:19 of adolescent anger and anti-establishment ranting.  Beautiful and raw.    8) Hook in Mouth(3) - Around this time, the PMRC and the Reagan era were in full swing, so the song had much more meaning back at the time.  I can only imagine how wild the crowds must have been when they played this.  As it stands, it's still a pretty good anger-filled chant, but a bit dated.

B0000669JL|5.0|OK, I am dating myself...Even so, the very first 45 record I fell in love with was The Eagles, Hotel California with Pretty Maids in a Row on the flipside. The first 8-track was Mothers Finest. Then along came my boyfriend with a tape of Bob Marley's Legend album and I remembered what it was like to fall in love with music again. Since that first listen, I have been through MANY tapes (some melted in the back of my car, some suffered the undesirable fate of one too many listenings, which caused the ribbbons to snap, some sufered cracked cases and still others were 'BORROWED') and had several CDs of this album. Every time one is misappropriated or damaged, I find myself buying another copy. I could have made Marley rich just on the royalties I have generated over the last 25 years. No matter what the mood, Marley never fails to touch me with his music, his vibe and his raw emotion. I have loved many a band, many a song, many a musician, but will always be ultimately in love with this album and with songs lit \\"Stir it Up\\". No album can make me sing my heart out like this one, or sway in my seat so resolutely. It's impossible to believe anyone could not love these tunes.

A perfect 'rainy day' CD, or for when you're shacking up with that special lady. Just kick it and let this CD take you away.<br /><br />My only complaint is that it's only a little over 30 minutes long...But worth repeating.
B00132GBRA|5.0|I used to wear heavy leather hiking boots.  Not any more.  I always heard that shoe weight was important, but never realized how important until I did my run in heavy boots!  It wore me out!  So I looked for the lightest goretex boots I could find, and this is the boot I bought.   I just got back from hiking the Sierras, including a two day trip to the top of Mount Whitney with a 35 pound pack.  The trails are pretty rough, and it rained for a few hours one day.  These boots held up well, kept my feet dry, and never once caused a blister or hot spot anywhere on my feet.  OK, so these boots are downright ugly.  But they are great boots!
0307237702|3.0|Although very well written, the book reads like a self congratulatory thesis. I wanted to learn more about Obama before voting in November, as the press hypes everything and we live now in the age of 'gotcha politics'. I am also reading McCain's book 'Faith of my Fathers.' Hopefully both these efforts will allow me to have a more balanced view of both candidates and most importantly - what they believe will be their uppermost challenges in the coming 4 years.
B001B71NOI|3.0|today i heard the slip one more time to give it a fair chance and boy what a slip it is. I mean yeah some of the songs are pretty tight but it's the same ol' same ol'.     I am so sorry to say that I find mr reznor predictable and lazy with the slip. He has nothing new to offer after all these years and instead of getting The Slip, I'd prefer a best of compilation as that would have better songs. What i don't get sometimes is how he'll chastise certain other artists but yet he doesn't realize that his best work is way far behind. He makes fun of the EMOS and i'm like \\"have you read your own lyrics on The Slip!?!?!\\". He feels nothing is progressive and yet he repeats the same formula and expects total adulation. and if he doesn't get it then the music industry is in the pits. K!     Please mr reznor MOVE ON and take a cue from coldplay cuz at least they are trying! oh and the world isn't such a bad place. we heard ENOUGH of how bad it is from u via NIN.

B000VBJEEG|5.0|...then \\"Ratatouille\\" is a good choice.  It's a great story with a lot to offer kids and adults.  But, the reason for my comment is that apparently computer animation has reached a point where it can render the stuff of nightmares.<br /><br />The rats have likable personalities and make surprisingly sympathetic characters, but each and every hair is rendered.  When there is rat pack on the screen, you can see each and every hair, to the point where it taps into conscious and subconscious feelings towards rodents (personally, I like 'em.)<br /><br />The juxtaposition of fine food with the image of 1001 rats scurrying across a kitchen makes this animated feature worth the investment of 90 minutes.<br /><br />Just don't try the trick of cooking mushrooms over a rooftop chimney in a thunderstorm!
B00005JPY0|4.0|There is no doubt that Dark Knight is well written and features an incredible performance from Ledger.    The underlying story is dull. The amount of crime in one city is far fetched. The characters endure forever as with almost every other comic. The idea that Batman simply doesn't have the gull or the anger to just kill the Joker seems ridiculous. How many die so that Batman can live by his \\"code\\"? Also, the idea that no one knows that all that high tech equipment Batman uses could only be produced by the richest man in town, also seems absurd. But as with almost all science fiction, we take it for what it is: glimpses of reality disguised in fantasy.     It takes liberties from the original comic, but we don't really mind because it sets in a seemingly more realistic approach instead of relying on a vat of acid, for instance. Clearly, there is still a sense of whimsy without taking from the comic completely. Overall it is dark and grimacing, as it should be. This includes the headache waiting for you from the deep looming \\"music\\" that instills a sense of distress in the viewer. (a reason I wish I'd waited and seen it at home)    Dark Knight raises deep morally rooted questions for which it gives some insight but lets you decide. It leads us through disconcerting circumstances that are no doubt amplified to shine a light to the very essence of our being. Through the darkness there is a morbid bit of comedy which goes right back to mimicking the balance that is an unavoidable part of reality. It plays with themes of balance, fate, fear, chaos, and desire. The way it was written toys with us so cleverly.     The stunts are inconsequential in comparison with the performances and writing. However, the acting of Bale and Gyllenhaal make them seem as though they simply worked out okay for the movie but are not perfect. Bale doesn't show us the remorse or the loneliness when the time comes for him to do so.    Is it worth seeing in the theater? I would say no, because most of the excitement comes in the dialogue which is truly masterful. Do see it though.

I've taken a number of vegan treats to share with non-vegans and they've all been a huge hit and a pleasant surprise to those who thought vegans were only allowed to eat grass and hay. ;-)<br /><br />The recipes are easy to follow and most of the ingredients can be found at your neighborhood grocery store.

B000YPUF9W|3.0|Ok, I know the Sci-fi channel had nothing to do with this.  I'm obviously using their reputation for fine film making (tongue firmly in cheek) as a measure of this films quality.  Is \\"Resident Evil; Extinction\\" really that bad? No, it's not THAT bad, but it's not so good either.  To understand where I'm coming from, let's quickly rehash my thoughts on the first 2 films;<br /><br />Resident Evil:  Original, edgy story, (despite cheesing off the video game crowd), creative visuals and fair characters combine to create a surprisingly good zombie, action, horror film.  The Director did a nice job with a relatively tight budget.<br /><br />Resident Evil; Apocalypse:  A simple story that appeased the video game fans, goofy monster effects and big budget explosions combine for an in-your-face silly action movie.  Gone is the great tension and visuals of the first film; still fun in a stupid way.<br /><br />This brings us up to date on where I stand in the Resident Evil series... ...until now.<br />\\"Extinction\\" suffered with, what I call, CREATIVE CONSTIPATION!! Dun, Dun, DAHH! (Very dramatic, I know).  Let's get down to it...<br /><br />-BEST OF BOTH MAKES WORST OF ALL<br />This film had elements from the first film that I enjoyed a lot (i.e.; the laser room; very cool) and elements from the second film (goofy monsters) that combined to make a more confused film than either of the first two.  As much as the second film disappointed me it was, at least, consistent in its mood and values.  As pleasantly surprised as I was with the first film, its best elements don't work when out of the context of the edgy story and creative environment.  The only thing that translated well was the theme music, which is still effective at setting a mood.<br /><br />-CAN YOU SAY; DERIVATIVE<br />I can forgive copying in the context of homage or as a respectful nod, but the \\"Road Warrior\\" theme came off as derivative here.  Certainly, in the context of a dying planet, copying \\"Road Warrior\\" would seem a logical choice.  However, did they really need a skinny bearded guy with big teeth and a strange hat (i.e.; the helicopter guy in RW)?  Of course, like most zombie films, the entire series pays respect to George Romero's zombie rule (infection by blood, head shots required, etc.),  and clearly is borrowing concepts from Romero as they make sense (i.e. ; experimenting on zombies, domesticating zombies) without ever raising the social questions.  Regardless of the intent; this film depended so heavily on past work that I could not help critique its lack of originality.<br /><br />-HOW DEAD CAN YOU GET?<br />The thing most frightening and disturbing about zombies is that they once were normal people.  In the first film, with a lesser budget, zombie makeup was limited mostly to grey face paint, prosthetic wounds and an emphases on good zombie acting.  This is the kind of zombie I appreciate the most; still human but lacking their humanity.  These are the zombies that give me the creeps because they seem somewhat plausible.  \\"Extinction\\" definitely had too much money to spend on makeup, because these zombies were so latex heavy that they lost all humanity and became monsters.  Also missing was the attention to detail where zombie acting was concerned; just a bunch of people in masks running around and attacking people.  More makeup does not mean more dead; just less human.<br /><br />-IT'S OVER WHEN I SAY \\"WTF!!!\\"<br />Here are a couple things that I had to sneer at (SPOILER ALLERT for those interested).<br />-In one of the least surprising moments in a film ever to be presented as a revelation, Alice (Mila) finds out that she is the savior of all mankind.  If you didn't figure this out in the first film; shame on you.  The ability to fry circuits in space WAS a surprise; ugh!<br />-Apparently, too much vaccination can cause otherworldly mutations in humans infected with the \\"T\\" virus.  When I say otherworldly, I mean you will be able to instantly heal, use bad breath as a concussion weapon and grow tentacle fingers capable of shooting across the room.  This is amazing since it never did more than stop zombification before (sometimes it didn't help at all).  The worst part is, the mutation looked pretty bad.<br />-You shouldn't drive heavy trucks and Hummers in a post-apocalyptic world; fuel mileage will be a bit of a problem.<br /><br />-IF YOU CAN'T SAY SOMETHING NICE...<br />So here's a list of things I thought were cool or interesting but only as stand-alone ideas that could not make this a good film on their own:  (some more SPOILERS, beware.)<br />-Zombie Crows; a scary proposition.<br />-I liked the main characters for what they're worth; not great, but not bad either.<br />-A zombie bomb (drop a dumpster full of zombies) was kind of clever.<br />-The laser room (sorry, it's just so cool!!)<br />-I give Mila credit for her ability as an action Heroine.  She is very capable.<br />-There was nothing inherently wrong with the production values.<br /><br />-HOW CAN I WRITE SO MUCH ABOUT SO LITTLE?<br />Yea, really; this film did not warrant such \\"deep\\" analysis.  I thought the first RE film was very creative and creepy.  I thought the second was crude and dumb but entertaining on a basic level.  This third film was visually better than the second but lacked the cohesiveness and creativity of the first.  As a result, you get a mish-mash of a film.  Big Budget production values with a less than enthralling story.  I can only recommend this for fans of the game and completists who must have the whole series.<br /> -Visuals......4 stars<br />-Characters...3.5 stars<br />-Story.........2.5 stars<br />-Monsters....2 stars<br />-Fun/scares..2.5 stars<br />Average.....2.9 stars.ss the room.

B00133KDM8|3.0|I have owned the limited edition with DVD for months and have hesitaited every time that I sat down to write a review. Part of the reason why is because I wanted to avoid the inevitable comparisons with Nightwish. I personally think that both parties involved are worse off than if they had stayed together. Yes, there is some of the power metal guitar work that everyone is used to hearing along side her voice, but it is only on display in a few songs. Enough of that..... This is actually a well conceived album, but it seems, in many songs, to be missing a fullness and depth that Tarja's powerful vocal style demands. Many of the songs would have benefited from addition musical accompaniment and more complex arraingements. Also, this a relentlessly dark CD, with the exception of You Would Have Loved This, from her previous release and the Alice Cooper song Poison. Dark and haunting in a way that only the Scandinavians seem to know how to do. Listen to the words on I Walk Alone and you will have a good idea where the rest of the lyrics are heading. Also, it will give you some idea of the epic sound and texture that this disc almost has. That is, in my opinion, the most frustrating aspect of this CD. Having said that, I would rate this as a 3.5.

Immediately after I finished it I mailed it to my mom to read and told her when she was finished to give it to another woman. It was insightful,funny, and easy to relate to. I cannot wait to read another one of her books!
B000AMJDHY|5.0|This is one of the best albums that I've heard in years - and I'm not your typical Panic!At The Disco fan... I'm in my early 30's and I like bands such as Interpol, Franz Ferdinand, the White Stripes, and older stuff like Nick Cave, Tori Amos, and PJ Harvey.    I appreciate the clever, literate lyrics and the creativity of sound. The blending of styles of music is a very welcome change from bands whose entire albums sound like one big long song.     I appreciate the subtle (and not so subtle) ironies of the vocal presentation, and I respect their musical ability.    I should also mention that I lived in Vegas for seven years and this album is SO VEGAS. I really hate that some critics have made nasty references to My Space,etc. NO! NO! A THOUSAND TIMES NO! THIS ALBUM IS ABOUT LAS VEGAS, NOT THE TRIVIALITIES OF MY SPACE.     Maybe if one has lived in a Vegas or has spent a lot of time there, it's easier to appreciate some of the songs...    My favorites are \\"Build God. Then We'll Talk,\\" \\"These Tables Are Numbered For A Reason..\\", and \\"Nails for Breakfast, Tacks for Snacks.\\" And the \\"Intermission\\" - wow, that's such a cool break in the middle of a rock album.    I think \\"I Write Sins Not Tragedies\\" is a little bit mainstream teen fare, but it's still catchy and fun.    I love the verses of \\"Lying is the Most Fun A Girl Can Have...\\" but the chorus was totally lost on me (why this teeny-bop stuff in the middle of an otherwise sexy song?) until I paid closer attention to a few of the lyrics.    This album is a work of art, and it's clearly meant to be listened to in it's entirety from beginning to end.
0156030209|5.0|I read this book 3 years ago and was looking up the author on Amazon to recommend it to a friend and I couldn't believe it only has an average of 4 stars. Of course i remember the story but I can't remember every nuance that moved me and put such light in my heart. So without giving away details I will just say that there is a lot of symbolism and underlying meanings going on so even though it was fiction I felt like a better person for reading such a beautiful story. I gave it to a friend when his grandfather died and he said that was the perfect novel to have with him during that time. Hope you enjoy as much as we did.
B000RG1FMO|3.0|This will be short but sweet. So much hip-hop today, almost all of it is garbage. There is an overflow of so-called rap artist in todays music market, and hip-hop is being destroyed. Even though Kayne West is more in the \\"pop\\" areana of hip-hop, this album is pretty enjoyable and catchy. Kayne doesnt lay down wanna be gangster tracks here, so he gets bonus points just for that. The sampling of some of the songs is done well, and the lyrical content of the album is solid. Perfect? No, Solid, Yes, and worth a listen even for non-hip hop fans or those as myself who mostly like oldschool (almost everything up to 2002, then after, most everything sucks) might enjoy some of the catchy tracks<br />Overall Grade- B-
B000WGWQG8|5.0|I'd already seen this on HBO, so I knew what to expect. This is a great miniseries, and with Amazon the price is always right. Thanks again Amazon, I'd buy anything from your site.
0385339607|4.0|Plenty of plot reviews about this book -it's Grisham, so I won't go any further to describe it. The plot was thin, IMO, hardly much struggle (conflict), with not much of a climax.  But it read so, so well!  I was completely entertained on every page.  I wanted to know what would happen next, and I can't even explain why.  I just know I liked it!
B000AA4JMU|5.0|This is an excellent set for the money.  I checked at retail stores, and each individual item costs more.  Of course, my 9 year old now knows all the words to all the songs.  I particularly enjoy this version of Oliver Twist.
B001CFOPMQ|4.0|This album is not NIN's best but its certainly a strong album but please don't buy it at Amazon when nin.com states that they plan to keep the full album available indefinately as a free download.  If you love NIN, grab the limited edition physical release while it's still available - Amazon currently has a great price considering it has a DVD in addition to the CD.
1416524800|2.0|I know it's fiction and I know it's escapist \\"candy\\", but from the entire premise of the story to the narrow escapes (banging out SOS on a glacier in the middle of the ocean will summon a submarine?)  to the trio of heroes (who for some reason kept reminding me of Harry, Hermione, and Ron) that triumph in the end, it was just too unbelievable to ever really get into.  Another thing that turned me off was the \\"steadfastness\\" of some of the characters, especially Corky.  If I had to read \\"That's impossible!\\" as his reply to one more suggested theory, I would have screamed.  Someone once said \\"Close the mouth and open the mind.\\"  These characters could learn a thing or two from that person.  That said, I stayed up until 3 am finishing it last night.<br /><br />If you like neat, tidy coincidences, don't need any real substance, and can stomach the \\"romance novel-type\\" dialog/wording throughout, this book is OK.  There are some plot twists you can see coming a mile away, but others that sneak up on you and keep things mildly entertaining.
0385340567|3.0|This book is good but not great as some of the past stories have been.
B0000AQS0F|2.0|The basic concept and the production are very good. The actors stay fateful to their characters. But the characters are odd and not well developed or integrated. In particular the characters of the happy-hooker promoting pay-for-sex and homosexuality, and the mental-case playing the professional victim. They soon become a burden to the storyline to the point I did not finish looking at all episodes. There is a reason for the $22 new-price for a 675 minutes series...
B0000UJL96|5.0|Following on the heals of the train wreck that was `The Final Frontier', `The Undiscovered Country' was the last chance for the original Star Trek cast to go out on a high note. Undiscovered is probably the most underrated of all the Star Trek movies in fact I would probably rate it just below `The Wrath of Khan' in terms of quality. It's also probably the truest representation of Gene Rodenberry's vision of overcoming prejudice and bigotry.<br /><br />The movie is written as an allegory for the breakup of the Soviet Union that was occurring at the time and the disaster at Chernobyl. The message of the film is important and remains relevant even decades later. It is the ongoing debate between those who saw a single superpower world as an opportunity for the U.S. to cast aside restraints and take a more active, aggressive role in world affairs. On the other side are those who saw a tremendous opportunity for peace and a draw down of forces. At the time the world was just starting a dramatic rearrangement of power while today the reverberations include ideas like the Bush doctrine of pre-emptive strikes, the flaunting of international laws by the United States and the burgeoning budget of the U.S. armed forces. The hawks are definitely in charge.<br /><br />There is also a subtext of racism with a subtle implication that Klingon's are sort of the American blacks of alien cultures. Note the `Guess who's coming to dinner' comment by Chekov. This is the most controversial part of the movie since the Klingon's have always been portrayed as crude and warlike. However, in keeping with the spirit of Rodenberry there is, of course, mutual understanding between humans and Klingon's before the final credits roll.<br /><br />One of the great things about this movie is the decision to have Kirk initially side with the war hawks calling for putting the boots to the Klingons. He utters a classic line when discussing the future of the Klingon race saying, `Let them die'. Captain Kirk is generally portrayed as the squeaky clean hero so it was a bold stroke to write him with such bitterness and vengeance but perfectly understandable given the events of the previous movies. In fact the entire crew of the Enterprise comes off as rather snobbish and condescending towards their Klingon guests but that was the point of the movie. It's about growth and acceptance.<br /><br />Christopher Plummer is fantastic as the Shakespeare quoting General Chang. His is one of the most indelible characters ever in Star Trek and the battle between The Enterprise and Chang's cloaked Bird of Prey was an absolute classic with a satisfying finale. I have to admit the movies ending was a bit hokey but `The Undiscovered Country' is a fine send off for the original cast and a great movie.k is generally portrayed as the squeaky clean hero so it was a bold stroke to write him with such bitterness and vengeance but perfectly understandable given the events of the previous movies.

B000MQ58VS|5.0|My sons insist that blu-ray is the way to go, so I did. After watching 'Happy Feet' with them I was sold. The detail is amazing. Finding Neverland is one of my favorite story-within-a-story movies. I don't buy all movies on blu-ray (meaning some of the ones I already own), but this one had to be. It's wonderfully done. Kate Winslet is so ethereally beautiful that I love her in anything, and Johnny Depp is perfect in the part. Her boys, befriended by Depp at a time when their mother was dying, were made more thoughtful and appreciative of the magic of the story of Peter Pan and its first debut on the London stage. I love watching the face of a little boy seeing his first 'magical' performance without the blase' expression which kids now would show to anything not graphically enhanced.
B00005JPY0|5.0|Its not often you get to see a movie so well done and I would highly<br />recommend this one. Its dark, visual, menacing, action packed, colorful,<br />and keeps the roller-coaster pace throughout. A long movie by todays standards(the attention span of most movie goers can only be stretched so<br />far in this country), but its so entertaining especially my favorite character in<br />this one, The Joker. I can't remember seeing a sicko villian with such<br />a profile on the big screen. The way he uses his tounge, his makeup, the<br />vocal touches, his body language and the dialogue were so perfect. If it<br />wasn't for this role I'm sure the movie would not have broken all these<br />records but thanks to the late Heath Ledger for showing actors/movie goers how to disapear into a role and make it so believeable. A truly<br />remarkable role of a lifetime and sadly his last complete project.<br />There wasn't a bad performance in this movie, Christian Bale does an<br />excellent job as Batman but I give the director 5 stars also for putting<br />this all together and giving us such great action and bringing this<br />comic book to life.
B000SW4DV2|5.0|Great animation.  I love fact that the robot's tribulations as a child gives him the experience he needs to become a hero in the end.
B0019FOC5E|4.0|Would have given this 5 stars without a doubt, except for those missing songs!!!  I get REALLY tired of these marketing ploys that victimize customers.  Now we all know that, in the near future, there will be an expanded edition of the soundtrack with the deleted songs and maybe some incidental music added as inticement.  So ABBA fans, Meryl Streep fans, and fans of musical theater will shell out another 15 - 20 bucks to buy it. It angers me!!!
0375842209|5.0|This is a wonderful novel.  Moving yet funny, very real about a terrible time in history but, because of it's observations on the human condition, more warm than grim.  My wife and I liked it so much we purchased 5 copies to give to friends.
B000PC6A3E|5.0|Pure bliss in this blu-ray release. The movie was already solid, but the high def transfer is one of the best out there!
0307278409|5.0|Highly recommend this wonderful, sweet, insightful and beautiful book.  Don't let the beginning of the book put you off.  It gets so much better closer to the end as Z grows and becomes stronger.  Her clever use of broken English is not just a gimmick but really adds a lot to the story. I got this book from the library, but will definitely go out and buy a copy to keep on my bookshelf.
0307346617|1.0|For what started off very unique and intelligent, this book quickly turned into a snore fest. If you're looking for a socio-economic/political breakdown and loose, disjointed story concerning the aftermath of a theoretical zombie war then this is your book! Want a good horror/action novel? Keep browsing.This is like reading the Warren Report but with less likable characters and poor pacing. Too bad, I couldn't have been more disappointed :(
1594489505|5.0|All I can say is wow. What the two women went through in this book is incredible, and to remain so strong through it all.   I knew that life was not pleasant for women in previous years in Afghanistan, but the cruelty of what they went through was just mind altering. Through the story of Miriam and Laila, we see the injustices that women suffered under the Taliban regime. All of it was with the \\"approval\\" of the government. Beating and torchering women behind closed doors was a fact of life for many, and how Miriam and Laila stayed so strong through it all gives real hope of endurance in rough times. I guess the best way to describe it is they  just had to survive and did what they could to accomplish this day by day.   You will not regret picking this one up. At times it can be a raw and brutal account of punishments that women went through, but the story teaches a lesson of endurance during hard times.
0743298039|4.0|I couldn't put this book down.  It had me guessing until the very end.  I highly recommend this book.

I depart from the world in my feeling that while Heath Ledger does a great job, there are any number of good actors who could pull this role off.

0446607274|4.0|Angels Flight was written near the ebb of LAPD's reputation: OJ Simpson had skated after the police investigation proved to be corrupt in most peoples' minds and Rodney King had been beaten, enraging those who feared and despised LAPD. Angels Flight is an attempt to re-create that era and give a sense of the pressures on those who were trying to do their duty while public relations and political concerns ran amok. The cross-currents of those disparate interests suck Harry Bosch into a cesspool of duplicity from which he'll be likely to escape.<br /><br />In Trunk Music, Harry had married . . . perhaps not wisely. As Angels Flight opens, she's gone . . . and Harry can't seem to get her back: The lure of the casinos is calling its siren sound.<br /><br />Harry has the weekend off: His team in Hollywood isn't on call. He's surprised when the top brass call him out in the middle of the night on a murder that occurs on the incline railway in downtown LA: That's Robbery Homicide territory. He's even more surprised when the murder scene has already been combed over and Internal Affairs desk types are everywhere. There are two deceased: One is a civil rights lawyer who makes his living suing cops . . . and who is about to lower the boom on the Robbery Homicide crew. Harry quickly appreciates that having two partners who are African Americans is part of why he's \\"leading\\" the case.<br /><br />Despite lots of pressure to pin the case on someone, anyone, Harry continues to investigate. What he learns suggests even darker secrets than appeared on the surface.<br /><br />Will he be able to outfox those who want a sacrificial lamb? How will his marriage take the strain? Can he keep his job? Will the city sleep quietly?<br /><br />The plot is a demanding one that helps reveal a lot about the police and Harry's perspective: Michael Connelly paints a broad landscape of human depravity that will stay with you. You'll probably become well engaged in the story, even if the situation seems forced to you in the beginning.<br /><br />I think you will enjoy this book a lot more if you have already read the prior books in the Harry Bosch series.  Give yourself a treat and go back if you haven't read them already.I think you will enjoy this book a lot more if you have already read the prior books in the Harry Bosch series.

B0013LPS8E|5.0|WAR was a breakthrough for U2, after the slight stumble of OCTOBER, and the remastering treatment that Universal has given it is warm and crisp, not harsh and shrill, so that you feel like you're in the room with the band. On this album, the band's sound and style, which combines new wave with 70s hard rock, starts to peak, with political, spiritual, and romantic concerns being given equal weight lyrically. Now that this album, THE JOSHUA TREE, and the first two albums have been remastered, now we can all hope for THE UNFORGETTABLE FIRE to receive the same treatment.
B0015HOFZI|4.0|What a neat product!  I've got several hundred 45's that have been collecting dust for years now.  I love the tunes, but the labor of playing a 45 is too much in today's world of mp3 players, take your music with you, create your own playlists, etc.  Now I can listen to my old tunes.<br /><br />The product is easy to set up and use.  The sound quality of the recordings is fine.
B0013LPS6Q|5.0|U2's debut album, BOY, along with their international breakthrough album, WAR, have both been given an incredible remastering treatment by Universal, which currently owns the band's catalog, and the results are wonderful. The remastering is warm and crisp, not shrill and harsh, so you actually feel as if you're in the room with the band. Basically, U2 marry the sound of 70s hard rock with the Edge's unusual guitar style and Bono's spiritual and political lyrics, which show the band's born-again Christianity to be a form where the members are hard on themselves and tolerant of others, which cannot be said of the Jerry Falwells and Pat Robertsons of the world. U2 are clearly ready to take on the world on this CD.
0812550706|5.0|No matter who I've loaned this book to, the response is the same.  They all have given it rave reviews.  In fact, this is the book that I've purchased the most copies of.  You'd think that I would have learned after not getting the first few copies back.  It is such a wonderful story that I cannot help but want to share it.     Please note that this is soft science fiction.
1401302378|4.0|This is a very informative book and helps one to understand the logic behind online retailers. I learned about the \\"long tail\\" topic during my graduate studies and had the opportunity to read Chris Anderson's book on the entire topic. I decided to take this opportunity to explore the topic in greater detail and found the book to be very insightful and intuitive. The book explains all the things scholars are inclined to believe and helps us to put everything else into perspective. Mr. Anderson gives insight into industry terminology (i.e. \\"watercooler effect\\") to help communicate certain phenomena and to give the concept definition. I am very grateful to have had the opportunity to explore and learn from such a magnificent author and educator. With all that I have learned from the text, I plan to utilize its contents in the \\"real world\\" to help others understand its implications for the future in retail.
B001B71NOI|5.0|I've been a Nails fan since the Broken/TDS days. Yes, it's common knowledge that Trent's calmed down a little. It happens with age. Some people can't accept that. Thing is, Trent has continued to be on the cutting edge of music for the majority of his career. He doesn't care what you think. He doesn't make music solely for you. He makes it because he loves doing it and he's dedicated his life to it.<br /><br />On to The Slip. It's a short album -- comparable in length to With Teeth. But that's where the similarities end. It's more of a straight up rock record at first listen. And you will hear a lot of Trent's signature lyrical pieces such as \\"Fading away,\\" \\"I am here right beside you\\" and \\"put the gun in mouth.\\" But that's part of the fun. Classic Trent. Classic NIN. This is fun little album with something for everyone on it. Two awesome instrumentals -- dark and eerie. A great piano/vocal song that could find a home on Still. And some really aggressive kickass rock songs. If you can't get into an album like this, I can't help you.<br /><br />The Limited Edition DVD is well worth the price of admission. It contains rehearsal versions of five songs from The Slip. And the energy displayed here by Trent (with no crowd) is inspiring. The guy really loves what he does. And one of the things I love most about NIN is when you hear live versions of the songs it's never like listening directly to the CD. He throws in a lot of different touches here and there to his songs that just plain rock. Echoplex, Head Down and Letting You really capture the feel for me here.<br /><br />If you're a fan of NIN, buy a copy. You won't be sorry.
1416909532|3.0|I had fun reading this.  Made me laugh.  Made me think how some guys treat women.  Some of the quotes and advise were actually good.  Everything was numbered.  A lot of the stuff was repetitious...just worded differently.  I enjoyed reading this.
B000002513|5.0|Having had the privilege of living in the Eatontown-Long Branch-Red Bank area in 1972, I really feel the verisimilitude and depth of feeling Springsteen and his E Street Band brought to every note and word of this album. Sandy, Rosalita, Kitty's Back, are, simply put, really hard rock songs played through a doo-wop, east coast, r&b type sensibility, which really fits with the preoccupations of a big city-resort area in the summertime. If \\"Greetings...\\" was Bruce's way of saying hello to his audience, this album was the true introduction. Anyone who ever strolled the boardwalk with a young, wild, yearning heart knows what this music is about, its greatness, its power.<br /><br />Bruce's almost photographic sensibilities render a true, gritty, romantic, and brilliantly alive masterpiece from the neon, the salt-water taffy, and the hustles. And \\"Wild Billy's Circus Story\\" is simply a classic of  the carny life, right up there with \\"Freaks\\" and \\"Nightmare Alley\\".<br /><br />But this music is more than that, I realize. The Band's playing and Springsteen's writing are at a level here that beggars description--buy it. Listen. It's a GREAT album.
B0007OY2MG|5.0|As a new-ish but rabid fan of the show I have seen all seasons.

A sheep herder goes on a journey to find purpose in his life, treasure, love, and finds it.<br /><br />\\"The Alchemist\\" I read because it's been recommended to me more than any other book in my life, it's passed my gaze on bookshelves of friends. I'm glad it's over.<br /><br />I can finally say I've read the epic hyped out novel about a guy who learns to intuitively guide himself through life paying attention to omens and people with wise things to say who are good at magic.<br /><br />An easy read. A little over an hour. Not too much flash. Lots of spiritual guidance type substance. A dallop of God and manipulating nature with inherent psychic abilities stuff. Camels.

Perfectly cast Val Kilmar as Jim Morrison and his girlfriend Meg Ryan take you through the wild, ride of the life of Jim Morrison and his band.  Along with the evolving music of his band and the rising drug addiction that influenced the future of his life.

B000MRAAJM|5.0|This is the most fantastic nature documentary series ever made. On Blu Ray, it is even better! There is no bonus footage like the DVD set but I have seen it, and it honestly pales in comparison to the actual show.

Order this version now and enjoy some of the most beautiful wildlife photography you may ever see in your life.
B001GZ6QEC|2.0|I was one of the VERY few people who came out of the movie theaters disappointed when 'The Dark Knight' released in 2008. I realise any film that's hyped this much is going to disappoint, but even movie critics were calling 'The Dark Knight' one of the best films ever made. Now I've bought the film on Amazon demand and watched it a second time because lets face it, if so many people are still praising 'The Dark Knight' I feel like I must've missed something.<br /><br />I think a lot of the hype of this film came from Heath Ledger's performance as the Joker. On second viewing I will say his performance is even more impressive. It's still amazing catching all his little gestures quirks that shows really how talented Heath Ledger was. In fact the acting (and casting) in this film is quite good. Gary Oldman and Aaron Eckhart really bring weight to their characters and along with Ledger their performances stick with you long after the film is done.<br /><br />For me the biggest draw-back of this film was it's screenplay. The overall plot of 'The Dark Knight' is actually very well observed (especially of post 9/11 society) and very intelligent especially for a superhero film, but it's logic and characterizations fall surprisingly short. Bruce Wayne comes off as petty and unlikeable and his 'Batman' behaves more like a cranky 'Jack Bauer' who breaks a criminal's legs when he doesn't get his way (to no avail I might add). In fact nothing Batman or the police did seemed to have much logic behind it. You can say 'Hey, it's just a comic book film' but when you have these dazzling scenes of the Joker robbing a bank (which was a GREAT opening!) in linear detail to all of a sudden have a character fake their death or suddenly get kidnapped OFF-screen it seems the filmmakers were only logical when it was convenient for the story.... and I guess we're just supposed to take the rest for granted. It also didn't help that the dialogue was pretty artificial (the screenplay loves it some exposition) and the love-triangle, much like the rest of the story felt tacked-on for convenience.<br /><br />My disappointment wasn't just in the hype for 'The Dark Knight'. I loved 'Batman Begins'. In fact it's STILL my favorite superhero movie which I can watch over and over again. It's more thoughtful, has more class and I had a LOT more fun watching it than 'The Dark Knight'.<br /><br />Despite my complaints about it's story, I will say 'The Dark Knight' has some well-staged (if bafflingly edited) action scenes. The fight in a Hong Kong Skyscraper, the car-chase through the underground tunnels, and especially the final scene with Batman using the cell phone technology to save hostages and fight off both the Joker AND the police was jaw-dropping! The scenes look amazing on digital transfer. I don't know how the DVD looks but if you liked this film you WON'T be disappointed with the Blu-ray or even digital download.<br /><br />Sorry to rant so much. I know I'm still in the minority here. I'm not a film critic and I won't pretend I know what makes a good movie. However as a movie-goer and comic book fan I found 'The Dark Knight' unworthy of it's praise. Heath Ledger was a great actor and gave a terrific performance but he should not have to carry this movie alone.

Especially track 1 \\"why so serious?\\" it sounds mostly just like noise.  At home I have Sennheiser HD 595, and it sounds almost like a different song, there are just so many nuances.  If on track 1 around 3:27 to 3:40 you don't hear anything, you need a better speaker/headphone.  Anyway I really like this soundtrack I might bring my HD595 to the office.

0743277465|5.0|\\"The Art of Learning\\" by Josh Waitzkin, while largely autobiographical, contains some really priceless ideas on concept of skill mastery.     The book is an insider's look at what it takes to becoming world class in any field. The second part of the book, which talks about Josh's journey through the martial arts is particularly revealing in this regard. Focus, but also recuperation, are crucial elements... this is very well illustrated in the book, through examples from Josh's life.     Besides that, a lot of it is downright inspirational... I was particularly inspired by Josh's account of training through an arm injury to reach an ever greater level of success. A lesson to all of us who sit on the sidelines as soon as we get hurt a little.     I would have loved to hear perhaps a \\"metaphysical\\" perspective on the Art of Learning... does complete devotion to a skill lead to happiness, ultimately? Perhaps the subject of a later book!

B0007TKH66|4.0|I have always been a great fan of the original Kirk/Spock Star Trek - so it took me a long time before I could get into any of the other franchises. It took a couple seasons to get into TNG (I still can't watch the first couple seasons)and I thought it couldn't get any better than Voyager. I never could get into Deep Space Nine or Enterprise. About a year ago, out of desperation, I started watching Enterprise from the very first episode on SciFi Channel - and I was hooked. It is a great story that fills in lots of blanks about the Star Trek Universe. There is a wonderful set of characters that take you back to the beginning of warp travel and meet some incredible aliens. There are lots of good stories and effects to make any fan eager for more. I am now going through the 4 box sets where I am savoring every episode again and again. Don't miss this series!
B001B71NOI|3.0|The funny thing about this album is that although every song is good, not one song stands out as something you would want to go back and listen to again.<br /><br />After Year Zero, I was excited about another album coming out so quickly after, but you get what you wait for. The Slip is without a doubt a well-made album, it's just not memorable.
B0017I1FP8|5.0|This score has it all. I bought this the day it came out. I knew this was going to be a good soundtrack because in begins there where little snippets of an actual \\"Anthem\\" in the score. Zimmer exclamined that Batman did not earn his theme because its an orgin movie and everything needs a begining. Well, in this one Zimmer covers a theme for batman ABOUT 7 of them! easily the best song on this cd alone is \\"Like a dog Chaseing Cares\\" which has three themes going on at once. Batman's, Harvey Dent's, and of course at 3:38, Joker's! and of course we have the 16 min song of greatness that gave me goosebumps \\"A Dark Knight\\" this closes up everything and James Newton Howard does most of the work this time around and it sounds AMAZING!!! BUY this CD at first when i listened to it I felt kinda skeptical......but then I got really used to it......Batman is back....BUT A DARK KNIGHT.........and Phenominal in every way.
B000RPTQ1C|4.0|In a word, brilliant. From beginning to end, great! Cemerteries of London have a wonderful arrangement and tempo with the finale Death And All His Friends like a 21st century Bohemian Raphsody. Great work guys!
B00011KHTM|2.0|This works well enough, I suppose: you plug it into your Macbook and it makes a picture on your VGA monitor.  However I find the quality of the conversion from mini-DVI to VGA to be lacking.      I expect a certain level of inaccuracies using a VGA cable for an LCD screen (rather than a DVI cable where the signal can be digital all the way from the computer to the monitor), but using the identical monitor plugged into a true VGA port on a different computer, the display is much crisper.    On my 1280x1024 resolution 19\\" monitor, the pixels are visibly blurry.  It's most noticable on text -- where black text appears to have a small halo of blur or other colors around it.  Small text is nigh unreadable.
1401307450|2.0|I was pretty shocked that between the alleged writer, ghost writer and a major publisher that somebody didn't catch a blatant mistake that really casts some doubt as to the effort and veracity of this manuscript.  About midway thru the book Anthony starts to discuss his contract negotiations with Warner Brothers and company president \\"Mo Austin\\".  I believe, unless he was kidnpped by aliens, that the head of Warner's at this time was actually a man named Mo Ostin, a relatively well known figure in the record business. This would be like writing a book about the real estate industry and referring to a \\"Danield Trummp\\"  This makes me wonder if Anthony either didn't even read the manuscript or didn't know how to spell the name of a reasonably important business associate, namely the person responsible for paying him millions of dollars annually.  And the ghost writer should be ashamed of himself.  Obviously, the publishing company probably didn't care since this has a People Magazine quality to it that spent more time racking up naked photos of ex-girlfriends and endless gossip about intercourse and \\"babes\\".  I expected a lot more from this book.  On some level, I was entertained but ultimately this is a very disposable effort that is much like a fast food meal.  Anthony's youth, his struggles with finding artistic success, his incredible self destructiveness and creative abilities are ultimately overwhelmed by the low rent, frat house behaviors that he knows are inappropriate but still seems all too willing to share.  We never find out about what happened to his Dad in terms of how he left California, people like George Clinton who fade in and out without any follow up.    As much as Anthony's drug use is discussed in detail, he frequently pussies out with justifications stemming from inadvertent dentist novacaine and wrongly prescribed pharmaceuticals.  I would have been more sympathetic if he manned up and just admitted that on all of these relapses it wasn't a relationship or a wrong prescription, he just wanted to fall off the wagon.    A word about the women.  Living in LA, I get the sense that Anthony's outlook on women is totally defined by looks only.  It was astonishing to me that a streetwise individual would have a woman he had broken up with come back to him and then after this leech starts trying to threaten him for palimony he falls madly back \\"in love\\".  Only in LA.  Another LA reference which I'm sure AK is already cringing over is his discussion of Kabballa which has already come and gone like alfalfa sprouts and oxygen bars as a passing and absurd fixation of LA's jaded. More revelatory moments (besides the aforementioned baffling inability to attend his \\"friend's\\" funeral) was when he went to give a Christmas present to Ione and the mother wouldn't even let him into the house.  The mother must have been very pleased with the type of behavior her daughter, a veritable child was having to endure.  It takes a lot of bad behavior to generate that kind of hostility.  Also, the story where he is so loaded that he forgets that he made a deal to sell his house and a realtor does that and he isn't even informed.  Hello, doesn't a seller have to sign reams of paper during that process.  that one was a bit hard to swallow especially because a buddy's family was literally living there.  this all happened in a week.  Can you spell escrow period? That's gotta be at least 30 days.    Anyway, I did find this book fascinating at least from the level of abuse and the hilarious kowtowing to celebrities that allowed anthony to literally walk the Earth as a veritable emotional, physical, ethical and professional zombie.  Finally, this was written in 2004 with a supposed happy ending of sobriety but I don't think any reader would be at all surprised to find anthony hiding out in some future seedy motel, blazing away.  I don't wish that on him or anyone else but it eems that if he can't even really explain this continual obsession to us readers he probably doesn't understand it himself.  For a true biography of personal tragedy and the tortured artist those looking for a little more substance might like Richard Ellman's \\"Oscar Wilde\\", but, careful you will have to concentrate and you won't be able to read it with MTV on in the background.
B00127RAJY|2.0|Yes, this is hard and it's also very effective.  It's also extremely rushed and doesn't give good instructions.  I admire Miss Michaels tremendously for her work with morbidly obese people, but someone else needs to produce these videos for her.  It shows almost all frontal shots, with few side views, and no rear (spinal) views.  She gives minimal one-time instruction and you're instantly launched into the work-out. Beginners, good luck keeping up.<br /><br />I prefer DVDs that devote a segment strictly to instructions, like when to breathe, keeping the back straight, keeping elbows soft, etcetera, to get the best results, and then another segment on the killer work-out.  Jillian emphasizes not getting hurt, but does very little to remind the viewer about posture or position.  Other videos constantly remind you to pull in your gut, when to exhale, take pressure off knees, and so forth.  The work-out goes so fast, beginners barely have time to get into the next position, much less remember when she said to exhale or which arm or leg goes which way, etcetera.<br /><br />Using two other people to show Beginning and Intermediate was somewhat helpful. The Beginner girl had poor form, despite being very fit, and also seemed to have a hard time keeping up with Jillian's commands.  Some of her actions needed explanation, and none were given.  The other girl, however, was inspirational in the extreme.  I'm sure this work-out will do what its guaranteed, but it's difficult for a beginner because of its speed.
B0015519VS|1.0|I underastand that you have to make lighter creations when a parent, but OMFG this album has two songs and they are on video MTV, VH1, ect...A very forgetable project and album. Usher she get back to the music we have grown to love and not this garbage.     An Amazon.com purchase i wish I could return.
B0017KP93U|5.0|GREAT CD! EXCELLENT COMPILATION OF HITS YOU CAN JUST POP IN THE CD AND LET IT PLAY ALL THE WAY THROUGH!
0345495004|4.0|I couldn't put the book down once I started reading it. Nancy Horan managed to create a transporting drama without being overly dramatic about it. Beautifully and delicately written.
0316143472|5.0|It was a joy to read.  An author like Sedaris doesn't come along very often.  This was the first of Sedaris' books I've read. It had me belly laughing!  I plan on reading his other book, Dress Your Family in Corduroy and Denim. It was #1 on the NYT bestseller list.<br />I bought When You Are Engulfed in Flames specifically to see how another person went about quitting smoking and that's the essay I read first.  He gives me the inspiration, along with many laughs, to quit smoking<br />myself.  I only wish we could all go to Japan to do<br />it.  I think Mr. Sedaris has another bestseller on his hands.
B0012E6R3W|5.0|This is just what I needed to hear man. It's not as great as previous releases, but hell I love it. This is highly recommended.
B000W745CU|5.0|It's Harry Potter need I say more. I really love how the producers kept as close to the original book. I can't wait for the rest of the movies.
0385512058|1.0|I heard this guy at a conference, and of course our conference hosts presented us with the book as a gift in our rooms the night before.   I walked out on the \\"speech,\\" and thought maybe the book would be better.   Alas, it wasn't.   This is the most self-aggrandizing book of this genre I have ever read.    One wonders how many times that \\"I\\" appears in the book.   \\"I did this, I did that, I'm great....\\"    You name it.   His methods smack of insincerity and merely using people for his own advantage.   It disgusts me.    Much better material out there; don't waste your money on this one.    Unless you like to use people.
B001CQONKY|5.0|My favourite show never fails to deliver the goods. This is a fantastic season, despite the depature of Jorja Fox (Sara). Surprisingly, there was hardly any fanfare when she left (not on screen anyway). Her relationship with Grisolm was only beginning to take off for the viewers and before it could really get off the ground, she was gone.   In the first episode, Dead Doll, the team race against the clock to find Sara who has been left for dead in the heat of the desert. That was one of the best episodes. My next favourite episode was A La Carte where they investigate a beheaded teen from a go-cart accident. Then in Cockroaches and Lying Down With Dogs, we start to see Warrick in a whole different light - drugs and alcohol and he's framed for a murder in these two episodes. The final show for this season is called For Gedda in which Warrick is accused of murdering a famous Vegas gangster and even he is uncertain of his guilt or innocence. What happens at the end of this episode will leave every fan in shock (even though you've probably read about it or seen it already). I was devastated.   This season gives us a real good look into more of the characters personal lives. The story lines always remain fresh and there seems to be no shortage of material and ideas for keeping us fans loyal. It remains my absolute favourite show and as usual, I cannot wait for it's release. I only hope that for a change, they'll put a synopsis on the dvd cover of each episode. Sometimes you go to look for a particular episode and don't know the name of it - only the storyline - which makes searching for it a little tricky, but despite this, it's always a good buy and I thoroughly enjoy re-watching these all. I hope you'll enjoy it too.
B000W91RUG|5.0|I just love this show....its very clever and always funny.  It's the only comedy currently on network TV that I watch and sometimes I rewatch it on CBS.com.  Very few comedies made today can be called clever but this is.
080701429X|5.0|Viktor E. Frankl teaches us that light can be found in each individual struggle to find meaning within - even through the worst pain, suffering and dehumanization; even in the darkest corners of history...    The book is split into two parts: Experiences In A Concentration Camp and Logotherapy In a Nutshell.    Part one is an account of his experiences in the concentration camps (Auschwitz and several others).  Frankl gives us a picture of the sequence of three psychological reactions the prisoners experience to the process of imprisonment and freedom.  Despite the horrifying circumstances, we begin to see an optimism budding in the sea of bleakness: a unique sense of meaning in some of the prisoners which helps them to cope with the day to day horrors of camp existence - a meaning which holds their spirits up even though their bodies are broken.  This part of the book is unbelievably sad, yet the message it carries about the human condition is truly empowering.    In part 2, we are given a brief overview of Frankl's theory of logotherapy, a form of psychotherapy which helps patients find meaning in their lives - no matter what their circumstances.    The wisdom contained herein is so rich that after having only finished it last night, I know that I will be re-reading it for the rest of my life.
B000HEWEE4|5.0|OK, first of all, this is one of the top 5 movies of all time.  Before I even saw the movie, I was like \\"Sandra Bullock and Keanu Reeves are re-teaming for a movie about living in worlds 2 years apart, in the same house, but connected by a magical mailbox?!!!  This is going to be one of my all time top 10 favorite movies of all time!\\"  What I did not know at the time, however, was that it was going to be one of my top 5 movies of all time, easily beating 6-10.  I wish I could go back in time and tell myself--the self that hadn't yet seen the movie--that it would be this great.  Maybe I'll mail myself a letter.  No, I'm just kidding.  :)    Anyway, why this movie is so great is that it harnesses all the charm of Keanu Reeves and the spitfireness of Sandra Bullock without all of that distracting plot that you might find in a movie like \\"Speed.\\"  And by the way, how difficult is it to believe that a bus would blow up if it goes less than 55 MPH!  I didn't buy it.    However, \\"The Lake House\\" is a movie grounded in reality and has a real heart at its center.  Every time I watch the movie, and at this point it's about bi-weekly, I notice more nuances to Keanu's acting, and I get choked up every time I realize that these two wonderful characters really may never meet because they live in two completely different time periods.  I worry that they're never going to meet (even though, yes, I've seen it so many times)--which is part of the magic of moviemaking I guess.  And I think even if they do meet, will they understand each other's worlds?  If the me of now were talking to the me of 2006, what would they possibly have in common?  The me of now would be all talking about iPhones and stuff, and the me of 2006 would be like, \\"what the heck are iPhones?  Do you mean iPods?\\"  And the me of now would probably just get really, really frustrated.    Essentially the movie is amazing and you should really see it on a big screen to get the full effects.  If you don't like it, I wonder what you have in your body where your heart should be?  I really do wonder that.
1400063515|5.0|I can't comment on the science behind this book.  I will say that - at least from this layman's perspective - Taleb offers magnitudes of insight on the ideas of unpredictability and randomness, and does a bang-up job of upsetting the status quo.     The book is centered on the concept of a Black Swan - an event that lies outside the narrow periphery of our knowledge, has an extreme impact or causes a major upset (whether it be cultural, financial, political, et al.), and is characterized by a rampant slew of retrospectives - all the media, the so-called \\"experts\\", and the authorities suddenly have the details on why it happened.     For instance, we are told by historians of the outbreak of WW2: \\"tensions were mounting\\" throughout Europe, and that there were \\"escalating crises\\" abound, but according to bond prices (which offer a good understanding of history, says Taleb), there was no sign of this to speak of!  \\"One would suppose that people living through the beginning of WW2 had an inkling that something momentous was taking place. Not at all.\\"     The idea of retrospective distortion and over-interpretation fascinates me.  How people attempt to fit messy empirical reality into neatly organized interpretations!  The problem with our predictions, and our retrospectives, is that they are often framed from a naive perspective that we live in a place called Mediocristan, a place where randomness is mild, or Type 01, when we really live in a place called Extremistan - where reality is characterized by wild, unpredictable events that completely upset the averages of the bell curve.     ...We come out the other side mistrusting the arrogance of almost all predictions!  What does bird poop have to do with one of the most fundamental physical theories?  Do we think that our wars are \\"under-control\\", or do we consider the unpredictability of conflict - that a small conflict might someday spiral unpredictably out of control and result in the decimation of the entire human race!?!  How has the Nobel Prize been exploited to sell methods of market-interpretation that are completely unscientific, yet universally accepted and completely institutionalized?  We are treated to an interesting investigation of this arrogance which dominates so many fields of study and indeed, we find that it is an arrogance deeply embedded in our minds!     Despite the seemingly bleak picture, The Black Swan is great fun to read and offers tips (\\"be as hyper-conservative and as hyper-aggressive as you can!\\") on how to cope and perhaps even thrive in this chaotic, simmering soup we call Civilization.       If you are like me, you will enjoy reading about things like the narrative fallacy, confirmation bias, the ludic fallacy, the problem of induction, et al.  My only criticism of book is it's repetition, but honestly - I hardly noticed.
1600242316|5.0|One of the things I love most about David Sedaris's work is that one essay can send me running to the bathroom because I'm laughing so hard and the next can move me to tears. Not every essay has had much meaning for me but the majority are far better written than most of what passes for \\"literature\\" and best sellers these days. No one else has captured family moments, both poignant and hysterically funny, as well as Mr. Sedaris and I can't wait to see and hear him read his work aloud the next time he is in Ohio.
B000R7HY0K|2.0|i'm a big fan of tarantinos work and really wanted to love this movie.. everyone is right that except for the car chases and basically any scene with stuntman mike the movie is boring, lame , the ending is stupid.. i liked it better when tarantino made movies for guys ... girls talking about and Italian womens magazine is not keeping my interest. sorry
B00005JPY0|1.0|Noble lies...the truth must be manipulated; The masses are NOT to be trusted; You cannot negotiate with \\"crazies\\"; Law and reason is doomed to fail; Wiretapping is necessary; and on and on.... And this one scene I never thought I'd watch in my life time... ...Batman torturing a suspect inside a police interrogation room... One of the most expensive propaganda films of all times! This one star goes for Heath Ledger's performance. A sad and alarming excrement of neoconservative propaganda.
1892005034|5.0|This is the most concise, most clearly written manual on interpersonal communication I've ever come across.  It's an easy read, practical and to the point, and endorsed by the likes of Deepak Chopra and Arun Gandhi.  The meat of the book is the suggestions it's making about how to best communicate with each other, how to ask for what you need, hear what others need, and evoke compassion and empathy in yourself and others.  It's a book that I've needed to read for a long time; I can think of a number of occasions where I wish I had communicated better and been able to stay connected instead of disconnect in discouragement and anger.  I've been challenged by this book...challenged to be the change I want to see in my world.
0930289234|5.0|Watchmen, written by Alan Moore and drawn by Dave Gibbons, was originally published as a 12-issue series in 1986 and 1987. It is set in a parallel 1980s America: the U.S. won the Vietnam War and Nixon is still President. The story is almost indescribably complex. It begins with the murder of a former superhero, and the suggestion that perhaps someone is killing them off.<br /><br />There are seemingly dozens of characters here, all original to this work, but Moore does an excellent job of developing almost all of them, and of balancing their exposure levels. Indeed, half of Watchmen is character development, but it's well done, and almost never boring. There's plenty of action, too, including a suitably epic and very satisfying conclusion.<br /><br />The characters are what make Watchmen great. There are so many fascinating and deep characters here, and Moore uses them to explore morality on virtually every level. For this is what Watchmen is on its basic level: a morality tale, albeit a fairly bleak one.<br /><br />Dave Gibbons's drawing style is realistic, and on the whole it's quite good (although his overweight figures look a little stiff). It fits the story perfectly. As with Moore's V for Vendetta, Watchmen features no illustrated sound effects, and they are not particularly missed.<br /><br />Watchmen is one of the greatest and most complex comics ever written, and it's held up well over time. There's so much going on here that it virtually demands (and benefits from) multiple readings.
B001B71NOI|4.0|I have no idea what Trent Reznor is doing anymore, and I don't care. Weather you think The Slip is more of the same or not, if your fan, you have to appreciate it. Why? Because Nine Inch Nails is still one of the only bands out there doing creative material and pushing the limits of what we accept as good music. Incidentally, he is still breaking new ground. Name one other rock band who released an instrumental CD, let alone something as experimental as Ghosts. And we get some of that on The Slip with Corona Radiata and The Four Of Us Are Dying.     At this point, it's as if we get to watch the entire creative process in action. Every little musical thought or notion Reznor has is now shared with us. Some of it's good, some not so much and some you will truly love. You have to grow with your favorite bands.    Personlly, I think The Slip isn't as good as Year Zero. It can't be compared to Ghosts, that album was an anomaly. It seems a little random, almost like a summary of all the different styles he's been dabbling in for the last 10 years. I have no problem with Trent working out hi musical shops and letting his fans tag along for the journey. Just go with it.
B00005JKJA|5.0|I've seen this movie twice. I love David Lynch. Maybe it's best not to explain the plot at this point. Just watch it, and experience it, as the horrible nightmare that it is. Innocence gone bad. The horror of insanity. It's all there, in Hollywood, of course. A dreamworld.<br /><br />It's beautful, horrible, and tragic. It's David Lynch. And it's one of my favorite movies ever.
B000ASATZ8|5.0|Unbelievable pack for tremors fans for an unbelievable price.  Tremors is a great movie about large ground tunneling carnivorous worms that have made there home in a small town of hicks that use swear words like nouns, verbs and adjectives.  All of it comes together well and becomes an instant B movie monster film classic.  Why?  It is because the actors are not so serious and wooden, because they know the type of film they are making and they all are having a good time doing it.  What you get is a film that feels good to watch because characters in the story are built well and you feel for each of them.  You also get some tense moments where the worms almost get their victim multiple times. And of course you get some great monster mashing action where guns and explosives are a blazin'.   Tremors 2,3,4 are all more of the same, but 3 does fall a little short.  Overall great set of movies highly recommended.
0312360266|3.0|I read this book with an open mind, not like the authors. They continuously talk down about \\"People of Faith\\" yet the main character worships a goddess named Nyx.    Also, if the Cast's daughter tried way too hard to add an updated edge to the book which in turn takes away for the intensity of the story line. She should've kept herself out of this book in my opinion.    If I had the choice to read this book or something else, I would go with a different one, say Twilight, Vampire Academy or possibly Blue Bloods.
B00003CXDV|5.0|This movie is truly brilliant. As a life long Star Trek fan and attendee of sci-fi conventions, the reason this movie is so brilliant is because it's TRUE. From the weary actors having to bear the curse of Eternal Type Casting, the goofiness of devoted fans, the chore or listening to the same fan boy stories and the obnoxious male lead, I never stopped laughing. Alan Rickman is perfect in his role as the frustrated serious actor reduced to wearing an alien head. The casting of the ultimate Sci Fi female icon, Sigourney Weaver, is priceless. She really embraces her inner bimbo and has fun. Tim Allen as a Shatner-esque is a win!
B000EQH2QK|5.0|Bought this as a gift and the receipient was VERY pleased.  Seller got it to her quickly & in perfect condition.

B000YIGNKE|5.0|This was an amazing adaptation of Persusaion--the best I have ever seen. I am a loyal fan of Masterpiece Theater and was thrilled when they decided to adapt most of Jane Austen's novels. I have to say that I was very glad that they didn't do another version of Pride and Prejudice-nothing will ever top the Colin Firth/Jennifer Ehle version (no matter how good Keira Knightley is). Anyway, I actually happened upon this on the second showing and was amazed. Sally Hawkins is a very gifted actress and completely makes you feel the quiet sadness and reoccuring broken heart that is Anne Eliot's. And Rupert Penry-Jones as Captain Wentworth was seductivley unmoving and unfeeling--or so you are taught to believe until the steel wall around his heart begins to evaporate. I find myself catching my breath more than once hoping that Captain Wentworth will forgive and love Anne as he once did before with the fervent urgency as if it was my own love story. I highly recommend it.
