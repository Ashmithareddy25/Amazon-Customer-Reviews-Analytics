But it is still one of their favorites.  It has taken a beating and we still keep reading!  This is the book that I keep in my purse or diaper bag to keep my kids occupied at a restaurant, in a waiting room or at the grocery store.  It really is a simple little book with just the right number of peek a boo flaps!  I highly recommend this tiny board book to any family on the go :)[[ASIN:0981756522 Mommy's High Heel Shoes]]

031606792X|2.0|I felt ripped off when I read this book. Although I never really thought the series was written well, the books were addicting in a weird sort of way. They were my guilty pleasure. I got BD the night it was released and read it in one sitting. I felt so ripped off. It seemed like everything was done to fast and just to make that happy ending. I was annoyed by the almost anti-climax and the deus ex machina ending. Everything was made just to give the Cullens an edge and make the happy ending. That was it. There was never any real danger. I read the whole book feeling detatched. I'd read it if you've come this far in the series, but wait to get it from the library. Don't waste your money on this.
B00006DEFA|5.0|This is my very favorite movie. I have seen it more than 10 times, in the cinema as well as through Netflix. It never ceases to fascinate me. The concept of seeing Mozart through the eyes of a competitor, Salieri, makes the story very poignant. Through Salieri's eyes we see and realize the magnificence of Mozart's musical creations. Highly recommended.
0887307280|5.0|The E-Myth Revisited served as my introduction into the entrepreneur world. Raised in an entrepreneur family, this book hit home. It also helped create a niche within my own medical career more than a decade ago. The E-Myth is my favorite business book.<br /><br />Michael Gerber tells the story of Sarah, who went from making pies for fun to managing a store that delivered pies as a business. She soon became enslaved to her business, dreading the love she once had. But more so, unable to grow the business to achieve her vision.<br /><br />Gerber's ability to simplify complex concepts into practical ones is masterful. I would recommend this book to any person who is considering to launch his or her own business and to any executive who would like to run his or her group as if managing their own business.

B001KMB6X2|1.0|When the director of a movie disses his own creation as it's released, you know that you're in for something spectacular. Spectacularly ghastly.<br /><br />Alas, such is the case with Mathieu Kassovitz's \\"Babylon A.D.\\" You can see why the director denounced his own work -- the end result is an incoherently chaotic thriller that comes across as the malformed, mildly psychotic love child of \\"Children of Men\\" and \\"Blade Runner.\\" There are some really bad movies out there, but \\"Babylon A.D.\\"'s incoherence puts it in a place of honor.<br /><br />A Russian mobster (Gerard Depardieu) hires a thuggish mercenary with the bizarre name of Toorop (Vin Diesel) to do a simple task -- transport a girl named Aurora (Melanie Thierry) and her guardian Noelite nun (Michelle Yeoh) to New York. But it soon becomes obvious that Aurora is no ordinary charge -- she seems to have precognition and inherent knowledge that a sheltered girl could never have, such as how to operate a submarine. No, I am not making this up.<br /><br />But it soon becomes obvious to Toorop that more is going on here than it appears -- apparently a malign High Priestess (Charlotte Rampling) is aiming to create a genetically-engineered messiah, which Aurora is now pregnant with (she's a virgin, by the way). Now Toorop -- whose cold, dark, selfish heart has been touched by Aurora -- must try to keep her safe from those who would use her...<br /><br />The movie may be called \\"Babylon A.D.,\\" but a better title would be \\"Babble-on Addled.\\" Apparently Kassovitz's original creation was thoroughly sliced'n'diced in the editing room, and seemingly random parts were stitched back together. Therefore, this Frankenstein's monster is graced with more violence than plot, and manages to be both painfully simplistic and incomprehensible.<br /><br />Admittedly, I doubt that it would have been worth much anyway -- the absurd religious criticism is handled with the subtlety of a sledgehammer in the eye (Virgin birth? \\"Noelite\\"?), and the dirty dystopia reeks of better, more unique movies that have come before.<br /><br />But the choppy reediting makes it phenomenally awful -- about half the plot seems to have been whittled away. Presumably the plot was pared down to make room for the action sequences, which are filmed in a blurry, eyeball-jarring manner. Some of them -- like the snowmobile chase -- are outright ridiculous. Pair that with some truly excruciating dialogue (\\"Cross me and you'll have no place to hide anymore, Toorop.\\" \\"It goes both ways, Gorsky\\"), and you're guaranteed to have a headache.<br /><br />And near the end, the plot goes utterly downhill -- major developments spring up out of nowhere with only the barest shreds of foreshadowing, before spiraling down to a ghastly out-of-nowhere ending. It's as if someone slapped together two radically different versions of the same story, and expected the result to make sense.<br /><br />Vin Diesel is playing basically the same character he always plays -- a thuggish, violent sort who Lives By His Own Rules and growls threateningly at everyone. Diesel is a pretty bad actor, but even a brilliant one would be hard-pressed to handle this dreck -- particularly since, late in the movie, we suddenly find out that he's got a Special Connection to Aurora.<br /><br />Of course, Aurora is an even bigger waste -- she's super-smart, super-talented, super-pure, and bleats about sensing death when she isn't kicking butt with yet more magic abilities. Absolutely zero sense. Michelle Yeoh, Charlotte Rampling and Gerard Depardieu are all utterly wasted here, and it's almost embarrassing to see such good actors getting such a raw deal.<br /><br />\\"Babylon A.D.\\" is a spectacularly wretched piece of work, with a disastrously messy plot and random violence.

B000Y8G1K6|4.0|You can't go back in time. People and music change and you can't listen to an all new 2 CD set by one of the greatest bands ever and expect it to be Hotel California.  It's just not gonna happen.  All the members of the Eagles went their seperate ways for years and pursued solo projects to varying degrees of succes(most notably Henley) and then reunited for Hell Freezes Over and had recorded a small amount of new material between that and this album.  Many of the songs on these 2 cds sound like they could have been recorded in the Eagles heyday while others sound distinctly like the members solo works from years past.  This is not a bad thing in my opinion.         My favorites from this album would have to be \\"No More Walks in the Woods\\" based on the lyrics of a poem written by J. Hollander, \\"How Long\\", \\"I Don't Want to Hear Any More\\", and \\"Do Something\\".       In conclusion, I feel this 2 cd set could be somewhat better but compared to all the crap music being produced by other artists these days, this set is solid gold.
1591127319|1.0|had no idea this book had been in print so long.  After seeing the bronze statues in the park on a trip to Boston, I ordered the book as a gift for our seven year old granddaughter for Christmas.  I was not happy at the appearance or the \\"musty\\" smell of this old book, but the seller will not take it back.  I am trying to get the smell out of the book with baking soda, I will just give our granddaughter the book when it smells better, but not as a gift.<br />Buyers, be careful when ordering used books, I hope you are not as unhappy as I am with this purchase.
0142403873|4.0|I'm an 8th grade language arts teacher. I just used this book to teach irony, situational and dramatic. The product description does a good job describing the plot. It's about a quick thinking mouse who makes up The Gruffalo to keep others from \\"inviting\\" him for lunch, tea, etc. In turn, the mouse is shocked to learn there really is a Gruffalo and uses the other animals to make the Gruffalo believe he is a scary creature himself. My 8th graders loved it, and the simple displays of irony made it a good example for my students, especially my ESL students. My own boys (5 and 6) love it too. It spends time going to and from school with me, and everyone likes to read it again and again.
0440238153|5.0|What a fabulous book! Definitely my favorite of the trilogy. So well written and intricate. The ending was bittersweet, but made a lot of sense. It left you hoping for a 4th book or an epilogue of the future.
0786838655|5.0|Where do I start?   Alright,first of all,there is great character development and great characters.The story is great,almost everything about this series is great.  For those of you who haven't heard,this is about a tween named Percy Jackson.He has been kicked out of five boarding schools already and Percy has just gotten a letter telling him that he won't be invited back to Yancy Academy,the school that he is currently at.  While on a field trip he has a bizarre encounter with a demon who he knows as his pre-algabra teacher.  Through a whole turn of events Percy winds up at Camp Half-Blood,for all the demigods,or offsprings of the Greek gods.Percy finds out that he is the son of Poseidon.Meanwhile,he makes a friend,Annabeth,and finds out that Zeus is holding Percy as his prime suspect for the stealing of his master lightning bolt.  So Percy and his friends go on a quest to seek the theif and give back to Zeus what is rightfully his.  I reccomend this book to fantasy lovers and,actually,anyone who reads.You won't be dissapointed.

B000UR9T8C|3.0|While Spiderman 1 & 2 were very good, 3 was a let down. The acting alone was HORRIBLE. I saw an interview with Kristen and Toby and they were both bored and said it's like another movie (sigh). That really shows through. They spend too much time with Peter and Mary's problems for WAY too long. They show have focused on Venom more, he did look really great. I was so let down to see this movie as bad as it was and as good and it could have been. If an actor doesn't want to do a movie, they should pass it up or suck it up. This movie shows that money matters more to these actors than making a good movie for fans, let down!

031606792X|4.0|This is sort of a copy of a comment I made on another review, but after reading it I realized it was a review of my own.. sooooo I reposted (sorry).<br /><br />I read these books in sucession - curious about the movie that is about to be released.  Being that I never see a movie based on a book I've never read, I started reading Twilight. Before I knew it, I was buying a novel every other day.<br />In context Breaking Dawn is the best way I think that Meyer could have continued Bella's story.  The only TRUE dissapointment that I felt was when it ended so abruptly.  Though the novel was the longest of the saga, the ending was a bit rushed and left me wanting way more than it should have.  It would be a true disapointment (to me) if Meyer completely ended Bella's story this way when there are so many questions left unanswered.  The end was left completely open-ended... and that bothers me.  Open-ended books usually aren't that terrible but this one left up more to the imagination than it should have.<br />I agree with other reviews that a book based on Jacob and Renesme's \\"imprintment\\" would be interesting, but I'd rather have a more concrete ending to all of those unanswered questions left in Breaking Dawn.<br />So, if I were just rating this book as a part of the saga - and not the end of it - I would give it five stars; however, because Meyer wants to use this as her ending point, I'll have to settle for four.
078324228X|4.0|I've read most of the reviews here and either they are unwaveringly convinced of former boxer Rubin \\"Hurricane\\" Carter's guilt, or staunchly believe in his innocence to the point of ad nauseam. Others didn't care for the movie for whatever reason, while you had an audience who loved this story, didn't know it was a fictionalized account of the events and simply didn't care because they feel Denzel Washington can do no wrong. However, the review I found to be most on point about this movie is one that was written by Bruno P on March 2, 2006: \\"Unbiased assessment of the Movie\\". I found this review of \\"The Hurricane\\" to be more balanced than most and probably the best summation of this film. Go back and read it, and then reassemble your thoughts about this movie.<br /><br />Is it entirely factual? No, it isn't. Is it biased? Absolutely. It leaves out crucial information that would give the viewer a better understanding as to why these things happened to Rubin Carter. But what film \\"based on actual events\\" gives you the COMPLETE story? Not very many. This is NOT a documentary - there inwhich you would EXPECT the truth to be profiled. This got the Hollywood treatment, like most so-called \\"bio-pics\\" do. Certain situations and composite characters are \\"created\\" for the purpose of making the story watchable. \\"The Hurricane\\" glosses over events in Carter's life and made him look like a man unfairly victimized by the system since he was a child - which may or may not be true. Was racism a factor? Most likely - those who think otherwise might want to do some brushing up on their American history, specifically about slavery and the Civil Rights Movement. On the other hand, Carter wasn't an angel; he had a volatile temper, problems with authority figures, and had several brushes with the law throughout his life. But this is his side of the story, and it has the right to be told. Whether you agree or disagree with this is of no consequence. This is the way it has ALWAYS been in the movies. For example, \\"Lady Sings the Blues\\" (1972) is an excellent film about the life of blues legend Billie Holiday, a film where Diana Ross proved that she could definitely act, and she too, was up for the Best Actress Oscar. But it was 90% FICTION! Does that mean it was any less moving and convincing?? No.<br /><br />\\"Titanic\\" was also based on actual events, but the two characters the story was built around NEVER EXISTED. Yet you didn't hear anyone complaining about that - in fact, it won a truckload of Oscars, but again, no one made a stink about how the screenwriters took certain liberties with the script. The same goes for \\"The Hurricane\\".<br /><br />The story we see here is told from the point of view of Carter (Washington), the three Canadians (played by Liev Schreiber, John Hannah, Deborah Kara Unger) and a teenager from Brooklyn, Lesra Martin (a great performance by Vicellous Reon Shannon). The Canadians Sam Chaiton, Terry Swinton and Lisa Peters along with Martin, played key roles in getting both Carter and the young man who was with him that night, John Artis, released from prison in the 1980s. So it is definitely biased. However, as a movie, the acting is superb. The chemistry between Denzel Washington and Shannon is fascinating to watch, and Washington has never been better, especially in the scene where Rubin is in solitary confinement and faces the three aspects of his personality. This was the movie he deserved the Best Actor Academy Award for instead of the \\"give me\\" he got the following year for the overhyped and obnoxious \\"Training Day\\", probably the only Denzel movie I never want to see again.<br /><br />With such strong opinions expressed here, you'd think a lot of these reviewers actually witnessed the killings that night and can testify to Carter's guilt, therefore, you can say that this was the reason why Denzel lost out to Kevin Spacey in \\"American Beauty\\". So much was made about the verity of what we saw on screen from both the families of those killed on that fateful night in 1966 in Paterson, New Jersey, and those in the Hollywood community who doubted Carter's innocence. We will never know what truly happened that night, so why continue to speculate on it? All the debates in the world won't bring those people back.<br /><br />My point is, watch the film for what it is - a powerful, effective dramatic story, and nothing more.ful night in 1966 in Paterson, New Jersey, and those in the Hollywood community who doubted Carter's innocence.

0345350472|5.0|I became an enthusiastic fan of Philip K. Dick from the first novel of his that I read. All of his books are excellent, and this one ranks as one of the best. Unlike a lot of sci-fi writers, Dick's background is in philosophy which was his major as a student at UCLA Berkeley. The plot of this book is well-known from the movie:the human race in tatters, the natural world is slipping away, androids escape to earth and bounty hunters track them down to eliminate them. The book brings up some interesting questions. Are humans becoming more like machines or machines becoming more like humans? As machines become more human-like do their rights as living creatures increase? Does technology bring us closer to creating life or destroying it? The great thing about Dick books are that the questions they stir in us are endless. From an entertainment point of view this one provides fast dialogue, constant surprises and a perspective like none other.
B00008BXJG|5.0|Another classic AC/DC album. This is actually AC/DC`s sixth studio album and the one that broke them in the U.S and world wide. It is a brilliant album but what let`s it down a tiny bit for me is the production is a bit polished, but i suppose it had to be done to please some American record company executives. The album Dirty Deeds still hadn`t been released in America even after this album went gold in America. Dirty deeds only got released in America after Bon died and it went higher in the charts than Highway to hell did. Someone at Atlantic records just didn`t have a clue did he? The front cover artwork is different to the Australian version of this album and i prefer the Australian cover as it has more details in it (fire and a bass guitar fret board that looks like a highway/road. It`s a bit strange because Lynyrd Skynyrd`s final album cover artwork, before singer Ronnie died in a plane crash, had fire on it too, but was later changed after the plane accident. Another story i`ve heard is that AC/DC, who were/are friends with Lynyrd Skynyrd, got offered to fly on the same plane with Lynyrd Skynyrd when it crashed, but Malcolm`s wife didn`t want to go on it. Although this album is a bit polished it still is a great loud rocking album and any AC/DC fan (old and new) would still love this album. It has some great classics on here. The title track is my favorite and Beatin round the Bush is a bit of a more faster paced song, almost to the speed of early eighties Motorhead. The last song on the album \\"Night Prowler\\" is about sneaking into your girlfriend`s house while her parents are asleep and  making love to her. It`s got nothing to do with that Richard night stalker person, and what he though the song meant.
B0012EM5D8|5.0|This is a great movie.  My girls (2 1/2 & 1 yrs old) love it.  They watch it at home and in the car.
B00008BXJ6|5.0|This album is virtually the same as the Australian version of the TNT album. Around this time, 1975, AC/DC in Melbourne Australia had a very big skinhead following. They`d come to their shows wanting loud and tough rock`n`roll, and AC/DC would deliver all the time. That`s why, i think, this album has a very loud and tough sound. There`s nothing nice and fluffy about this album, it`s just loud guitars and loud vocals. I personally think this could be their best album. The vander and young production is fantastic and they really captured the AC/DC live pub sound on this record. I never saw AC/DC in Australia in the seventies as i was too young but many older people here that i`ve met have told me that this album TNT/High Voltage sounds very similar to what they sounded live in Melbourne pubs. TNT is probably my favorite song on the album. It`s only 3 chords and it works brilliantly. AC/DC were the first band to chant Oi Oi Oi in this song and they were the first rock band to use bagpipes in a rock song (long way to the top), 20 years before great bands like Dropkick Murphys tried it. I don`t know why bagpipes aren`t used more in rock music. They sound heaps better than trumpets or saxaphones. This album helped introduce AC/DC to British and European audiences who loved it as much, maybe more, than Australians.
B0007TKNIS|5.0|Excellent service as always. This was the only place I could find my favorite movie of all time in the full-screen edition instead of wide-screen, and best of all it was only 5 bucks. Of course I ordered an extra movie for a gift and the cd soundtrack. All items shipped the next day and I received them in perfect condition just a few days later.
B00008WT5E|5.0|I think even Malcolm Young said it, that this was their most forgotten album. It`s definately one of their best. It`s as good as Let there be Rock and sounds just like it. After the brilliant Let there be rock album you`d think that no way they could top that but they did with this album. Everything let there be rock has, this album has it too. A rare song appeared around this time too. A song called \\"Cold Hearted Man' which appeared briefly on the b-side of the single Rock`n`roll Damnation. It could have only been released in Australia too. This album should have been the album that broke AC/DC into the American charts like what highway to hell did a year after, but some stupid people at their American label, Atlantic, weren`t confident enough in the band, and even more laughable is that their American label didn`t like Bon`s vocals, they even wanted the band to get another singer way back in 1976. How wrong these American people from Atlantic were. Hopefully they got the sack after highway to hell went gold in the U.S in 1979. it just goes to show that the fans know more about music and what people like than some business people in suits and ties. Down Payment Blues is my favorite song on the album, it`s a great rockin` tune and not a very well known AC/DC song
B000001GEM|4.0|I'm certainly not a fervent fan of religious choral music.  When listening to any choral work, whether religious or secular, I tend to take an agnostic's objective viewpoint and allow the performance to either make me feel the composer's inspiration or perhaps even \\"convert\\" me.<br /><br />I've heard only two recordings of Brahms' seemingly popular German Requiem, this being the first.  First impressions, being what they are, left me nonplussed with Brahms' creation and in awe of the absolutely wondrous choral singing as well as the very fine contributions of the soloists; I was particularly enamored of the angelically sung \\"Ihr habt nun Traurigkeit\\" by soprano Barbara Hendricks.  The overall tone here is one of utmost reverence and solemnity in a performance that extends over 75 minutes.  Hearing it this morning, and after having experienced the leaner, swifter \\"period-inspired\\" performance conducted by John Eliot Gardiner, I've still not been \\"converted\\", but remain spellbound by the sheer beauty of this 1985 recording, apparently later re-released on this single CD without an appended Bruckner Te Deum.  If it was Brahms' intent to convey peace to the living, Karajan and company channel it marvelously.
B00008WT5C|5.0|This is AC/DC`s best produced album. Vander and Young did a suburb job on the dials here. Everything about the sound on this album is brilliant, the guitars are right up front and virtually assault your ears, the drumming and bass are tight as a virgin`s you know what and finally Bon`s vocals are so powerful and loud. It`s not punk but it`s just as, if not more, ferocious as punk but their playing and musicianship is much better than punk. This album, i think, made a bit of a turning point in British music back in 1977. Just as people were getting a bit tired of average playing punk musicians, along came this Australian album which had everything punk had but was more skillfully played than punk. It`s not punk though, it`s heavy rock`n`roll. I`d even class it a heavy metal album but i know AC/DC don`t like being called a metal band even though the majority of their fans are headbangers. Angus Young possibly even invented headbanging. Another good thing about AC/DC which separates them from punk is that AC/DC don`t make political statements, they leave that to boring politians. AC/DC just make you rock and have a good time. Sure there are problems in the world but that doesn`t mean that we can`t enjoy life sometimes. This album, like Dirty Deeds, caused a bit of stink in Australia due to songs like Go Down and Crabsody (which doesn`t appear on this overseas version). I don`t know why Crabsody is not on this release as it`s a classic like Big Balls is. Another song appeared round this time which is also hard to come by, a song called \\"Carry me Home\\" which only ended up on the b-side of the Australian released single \\"Dog Eat Dog.\\" Track it down if you can as it`s a classic song and is about Bon`s drinking habits. I haven`t a favorite song on this album as they are all equally as brilliant as the other.
B0007KTBIU|5.0|I always liked this movie, but it seemed over-edited, like there was too much missing.  It turns out there was, and with this 10th Anniversary DVD release, Disney finally fixed those problems with storyline and emotional impact, notably with the inclusion of the duet \\"If I Never Knew You.\\"  I hadn't seen this movie since the VHS release, which didn't look good:  the bright colors bled into each other on tape.  Apparently, the earlier DVD release wasn't that great, either.  But THIS release shows just how gorgeous this film really is: the colors are simply amazing, and the widescreen shows how striking the background art is (the design for the forest scenes reminds me of \\"Sleeping Beauty,\\" with a lot of vertical/horizontal contrast used.)      Too much was made of the historical liberties taken with this film at the time of its release during the politically correct Nineties.  It's not a documentary, it's a Disney movie:  get over it and enjoy the story.       There is the usual light comedy provided by animal friends and minor characters.  The villain is unlikable, but not really demonic or anything, which fits in with this film being more about people's fears and assumptions, and what the British were hoping to find in America versus what was really there.  It is true that the characterization in this film isn't quite as deep as in some of the better known Disney classics, but that doesn't detract from the overall quality.  I actually find \\"Pocahontas\\" to be one of the most poignant Disney movies because it is not a fairy tale, and everything is not perfect in the end.      The music of \\"Pocahontas\\" has never gotten much attention, except for the somewhat preachy \\"Colors of the Wind,\\" but it's always been one of my favorite Disney soundtracks.  Native American music provides a strong undercurrent.  I especially love \\"Just around the Riverbend\\" and \\"If I Never Knew You,\\" which was always present in the film during the credits.      I have to mention the moment whenPocahontas and John Smith first meet face to face in the mist in front of the waterfall.  It's exquisite and unforgettable.     No one can make wonderfully animated musical movies with heart like Disney, and I really hope that they return to making films like this someday, instead of just those Pixar movies.  They're fun, but they're not beautiful like this movie is.
B001DDBCUU|1.0|This movie was seriously a waste of 2.5 hours.  I honestly don't know how it has all of the 5 star reviews- unless it's from people who were not fans of the show.  It's so absurd on so many levels, and the characters aren't the same people they were!  It's impossible to relate to them on any level.  The film starts out with Samantha bidding $50,000 on a ring she wants just \\"cause it's cute\\".  Then Big jilts Carrie AGAIN at the alter- something he's already done during the episodes, and she has to act surprised and/or depressed.  They go to Mexico where Charlotte craps her pants during a Larry, Moe and Curly like scene that I assume was supposed to be funny??  It's not.  There are some nasty sex scenes with Miranda and Steve, which are kind of, well, gross.  It's just BAD.  I made myself sit through it because I love the show so much, but this film was so horrid it actually made me angry.  Again, perhaps those who weren't fans of the series will enjoy this, because they won't have expectations for the characters.
B000YABIQ6|5.0|Four reasons to watch this:  1. Jon Hamm is unbearably sexy.  2. The sets, clothing and other depictions of the era are perfectly done but not overwhelming.  They don't take on more importance than the story itself.  3. The characters are complex, human, complicated.  No one is a caricature or a cartoon.  Everyone, even some  minor secretary whose purpose in the show is to have sex with a major character, is shown as complex and human.  4.  The story lines are intriguing, compelling, multi-layered.    There are some story lines that don't interest me: I get up and fold laundry or brush my teeth and floss anytime one of the kids are central to a scene.  And I'm not interested in the horse-back riding life and intrigues of Betty.  But those scenes don't dominate this fabulous show.

B000035Z1Z|3.0|I started watching Bollywood films a few years ago and one of the first movies that I saw from India was called \\"Pyaar To Hota Hi Tha\\", which is a Bollywood remake of \\"French Kiss\\".  It was a great story with beautiful people and nice music.  The movie runs almost 3 hours and the two people in this film were Ajay Devgan and Kajol (actual husband and wife) who played the role of Kevin Kline and Meg Ryan.<br /><br />If you liked \\"French Kiss\\", then rent \\"Pyaar To Hota Hi Tha\\" from Netflix or wherever.  Since you know the story, check it out with a Bollywood spin.  You'll love it.<br /><br />By the way, did you know that \\"Meg Ryan\\" is an anagram of \\"Germany\\"?

0679882820|5.0|I grew up outside of the US and we didn't have Dr. Seuss books - at least they may have existed but they weren't used in our schools and we didn't have them at home. Therefore I have never seen the long version of this and am not disappointed by the abridgement. Since most very young children don't have a long attention span anyway I suspect at least some of the disappointed reviews are the result of parents getting nostalgic for a childhood favourite rather than their own child not enjoying the book. My 15 month old loves it, when we have play time it's the first book she brings me to have read to her. You can make a huge game out of this book if you get really immersed in doing the sounds and actions for your child, you can make it very entertaining and educational at the same time.

B000W99IK2|4.0|These two symphonies are among the best known compositions of Franz Schubert, who died far too young. Herbert von Karajan and the Berlin Philharmonic play well in performing these two pieces.<br /><br />First, Symphony # 8, \\"The Unfinished Symphony.\\" The first movement begins softly and then moves to a much fuller sound. There is a bit of melancholia and a brooding sense to this movement. There are differing dynamics in this movement. This movement closes out elegiacally. The second movement begins quietly and reflectively. It builds nicely and closes out, again, elegiacally.  I am not sure that this represents von Karajan and the Berlin Philharmonic at their best, but it is an effective version, quite contemplative.<br /><br />Symphony # 9? I have heard some refer to this as Beethoven's 10th Symphony, and, indeed, to my untutored ears, there are hints here and there--especially in the 4th movement.  The first movement begins with horns playing elegantly. Indeed, elegant is an appropriate term to characterize the entire movement. After the horns, the strings set things off nicely. Well done movement.<br /><br />Rather than going from movement to movement and taking too much space, let's move to the fourth movement. If the 9th of Schubert can be termed Beethoven's 10th, this is where it might be most apparent. The underlying them is almost reminiscent of the Ode to Joy theme in Beethoven (I wouldn't make too much of this, but I can at least understand the equation). On its own merits, of course, this movement is terrific. Von Karajan and the Berlin Philharmonic provide dynamics and tension in the music as things develop. The finale is glorious, with much power.<br /><br />So, I understand that von Karajan draws much criticism, but I think that this is a good version of these two redoubtable symphonies. Worth listening to. . . .
B000YABYLA|4.0|Sixteen-year-old Juno (Ellen Page) finds herself knocked up after her first sexual experience with her BFF, Paulie (Michael Cera). Abortion seems like the easy way out, but when Juno arrives at the clinic for her appointment, she finds that she can't go through with it. Instead, she decides to give the baby up for adoption to a wealthy couple, Mark and Vanessa (Jason Bateman and Jennifer Garner), who are unable to have children of their own. As Juno experiences the many ups and downs of pregnancy, she must come to terms with her feelings toward her unborn baby, the baby's father, and the adoptive parents. It soon becomes clear that the adoption process isn't nearly as simple as Juno hoped it would be, and she must deal with a lot of grown-up issues very quickly.<br /><br />I was very impressed by this film. Page gives an outstanding performance that is both wickedly funny and deeply emotional. Her characterization of Juno is very understated and yet incredibly powerful, and she steals every scene that she's in. The movie also boasts an impressive supporting cast, including J.K. Simmons and Allison Janney as Juno's father and stepmother. Although \\"Juno\\" is classified as a comedy, it's very bittersweet and downright depressing at times. The ending seems a bit too neat and tidy, but for most of the movie, the filmmakers dealt with a very sensitive topic in a very honest and emotional way. This is a very good movie that I recommend.
B0015DWJX2|5.0|If you have ever read a book that is so good that you are sad when it is over, then you will know what I mean about this book. It is a wonderful tale set in a time and place to get 'lost' in. Enjoy!

0307269752|5.0|I read Swedish, and read these in the original -- those who are waiting for the translations of the second and third books in this series have a lot to look forward to. The first one is masterful, fascinating, wonderful, gripping, and every other adjective you could possibly want in a thriller or mystery. What's incredible is that the next two only get better, with the same characters being drawn into intrigues that are much wider and deeper than the original story about a teenager's disappearance. My advice: place your pre-orders now for the next part of this series!
0671004107|5.0|This book arrived in a timely manner and was in excellent condition.  I am completely satisfied with this order.
B000B8QG4A|4.0|The US DVD have a severely cropped image (though not 4x3) compared to the english region 2 release, which offer the complete image in a very wide format, with lots of black top and bottom. In you don't have a 31 inch (or bigger) 16x9 TV set, this can look awkward, but if you do, get the UK region 2 release, if you can. The difference is dramatic! Believe me. I have both. I got the US version first, but as the resolution isn't enough in NTSC, I got the UK release as well, and what I got, and only recently discovered, was a much wider image.    The US image perfectly fill up the 16x9 screen, but...whoa, how much it leaves out!!!!
B001GM28HO|5.0|After being a writer for other artists, gaga decided to record an album of her own and it is probably one of the best i have heard (as far as dance pop goes) in years. Her voice is somewhat like Christina Aguilera's and Gwen Stefani's combined. Most importantly, all of the songs on this album are incredibly catchy and have AMAZING hooks as well as wonderful production. Sadly some of her best songs were left off of this record, all of which can be found on youtube ;), such as \\"rock show\\",\\"again again\\", \\"wonderful\\", \\"disco heaven, and \\"dirty ice cream\\". Getting back to the record, all of the up tempo songs are AMAZING (just dance; poker face; love game; beautiful, dirty ,rich; etc. ) and the ballads are VERY GOOD too, especially \\"Brown Eyes\\" which is mind blowingly amazing. It is hard to think of a track that does not impress me. For a newcomer, gaga has put out a very good first album and i hope to hear more from her in the next few years. I would venture to say that she may be a contender for best new artist at the grammys, or at least the MTV music awards. If you like popular music , with catchy beats and clever lyrics, and artists such as prince, madonna, britney spears, and david bowie this is a MUST HAVE record.
B0007MWZEK|1.0|What a waste of money !  I fell for the TV ad, which promised me 2 of them for the price of one.  Well, I got them.  One, of course, was broken.   It was too hard to find a real person to complain to and I had lost my reciept.  Anyway, Im glad that I had the Extra battery .  This thing runs out of charge before a large room is done, and i need to switch batteries.  Not only that, it is made so cheaply that sometimes it just comes apart, and all the debris comes out of the holding compartment unexpectedly.  It does okay with crumbs and that type of thing, but it wont even pick up paper shreds !   My house is full of kids and alot of my problem is little bits of wrappers and various paper trash left around.  My old dirt devil worked way better.  Of course, that didnt last a year either.  I guess theres no quick way to do this.  Get out the real vaccuum.
B000X5SPBI|5.0|Season 3 is as good as the first 2. The Winchester men are at it again, giving their all in bringing down the bad things, and sometimes not....  There is lots of action, suspense, and surprises. Some episodes, especially the last one, stunned, amazed, and scared me. I highly recommend Season 3 - watch it!
0375826726|5.0|I have like all of the triliogy/cycle books so far. Reading them all in less than 3 weeks most of the time. This book I actually read in 12 days. I've always loved dragons, so these books are simply great. I can't wait for the last book and last fight.    Just for all to know, the movie Eragon doesn't do the book justice. The movie is pure crap.    If youhave a kid who really doesn't liek to read, these 3 books would make a great gift and look great in anyones library!
B000YJ85BI|3.0|The first book was truly amazing, wow what an adventure. The second was quite good as well, with as much excitement as the first. However, this third one is lifeless compared to either of the first two. I just kept waiting for something more to happen, but it goes quite slow throughout.    He has them go back to being plain ole humans, which doesn't give a lot to work with. It ends up being too much like real life... which is boring.. which is why we read science fiction to begin with.

B0002IQEHI|5.0|It's the story of a man, who through a series of misunderstandings and coincidences becomes a victim of a spy and espionage set-up. When you first watch North By Northwest you may think, it's a very entertaining movie and nothing beyond that. Actually it is an extremely entertaining story and nothing beyond that. And it is one of the greatest examples of the genius of Hitchcock! He's the only director I know who could take a story as trivial and create such a mood of place and character, that every scene is successful in tone, mood and creative scene development. I feel like I've been put in a slight hypnotic state every time I see it. It is the bible of narrative for the action and spy genre. And I believe set the tone for the Bond films, which have never equalled it!
B00000JX0T|1.0|I had to write a review of this because it was so disappointing. It's 30 minutes and it only talks about Bolero even though it is supposed to be about his whole life. They talk about how depressing it was that Bolero was his most famous piece, yet they ONLY talk about Bolero and play that one composition during the whole episode. They say how he shouldn't be known for just this one piece, but then only talk about it. They say how Ravel was depressed about this fact yet only they only talk about Bolero. This could have been written by an elementary school student. Don't bother!
B00008972S|5.0|Based on Shakespeare's Romeo And Juliet and set in modern New York with rival gangs. This is a great musical! Bernstein's score is a masterpiece of vocal and instrumental arrangements! The sets are a masterpiece of colour and design! The dancing is glorious! The singing is passionate! And it has a raw yet romantic feel. The director has captured a unique and surreal world and has created what I consider the most extraordinary dramatic musical ever made!
0698118308|5.0|This book is adorable for preschoolers as well as the young grades. It is simmple to read and is beautifully illustrated as are all of Eric Carle's Books.
B001CC7PP8|5.0|\\"Mr. Hitchcock, because of your movie, my daughter is afraid to take a shower\\"    \\"You may have her dry cleaned\\"    That was Hitchcock's response to a mother who was concerned about her daughter's reaction to his film Psycho. This is a film that really affects the viewer. It's the first modern film on the subject of the psychotic killer. Its' narrative is one of the most influential in the genre of suspense and horror. The shower scene alone is proof of its' merit. It set a new standard for editing.
0393316041|3.0|This book is not a biography of Richard Feynman, a physicist who won a Nobel Prize for the development of quantum electrodynamics. But it is collection of stories of some of his adventures, thus the book's subtitle \\"Adventures of a curious character.\\" The vignettes of Feynman's life range from his earliest days fixing radios to his career as a professor. Some stories just defy categorization but give a certain texture to Feynman's life. The stories were very well written and somewhat amusing.<br /><br />On the plus side, the stories that Feynman writes about his environment or the organizations he worked in or for were very interesting and insightful. His personal stories about safe-cracking, dating, and picking up women in bars were by far less interesting. While Feynman frequently outsmarted his peers, he sometimes received his comeuppance from even smarter people such as Robert Oppenheimer and this made some of the stories easier to take.<br /><br />This book was disappointing because there must have been many more interesting stories revolving around his work and Nobel prize; stories that would be far more interesting than his ability as a  safecracker or his desire to womanize. Thus I do not recommend this book as a source of information on the history of science. On the other hand, if you are interested in learning more about Feynman's personality and learning that even Nobel-Prize winning scientists are also human, then this book might be a worthwhile read.
B0016K40KY|5.0|This is the true story of a young British man whose arrogance defies everything and everyone. With the passion of a leader and the heart of a conflicted man, he is a speck in the vast desert, influencing cultures and tribes of the Middle East to unite as nations and of course give advantage to the British Empire. Lawrence Of Arabia is poetry on film, from one incredible scene to another. It defined the modern epic. It has a rare visual artistry and beauty that will never date itself. Lean is a painter and his canvas is the silver screen!
0375701427|5.0|Roth combines two things we look for in a great novelist.  A thorough command of the English language and a human heart.  He can execute literary pyrotechnics on par with DeLillo or Pynchon, but what elevates Roth to the status of a master is his empathy.  He deep, immersive compassion for his characters.<br /><br />The last sentence of American Pastoral reads, \\"What on earth is less reprehensible than the life of the Levovs?\\"  It cuts through so much ephemera and filigree of lesser literature.
B00005JKGO|5.0|La Dolce Vita is a travelogue of one man's singular and unique experience. Fellini spares us the familiar arc and keeps the journey in a steady rhythm. There has never been a film before it that has captured tragedy, comedy, music, philosophy, romance, and social commentary in such a naturalistic style, yet it could not have been done without flawless preparation. Every scene has been one way or another an influence in cinema ever since.
B0013K6WLM|4.0|[[ASIN:B0013K6WLM Attack and Release]]   If you love BK, fer the love of MUSIC -- start hunting! There is more great stuff out there. MUCH more. Blues-based rock bands have been neglected and ignored for years.  And no, you don't have to go to classic rock catalogs to find them (check out Tishamingo's \\"The Point\\"). The irony is that it took Danger Mouse, a \\"hot\\" hip hop producer, to put this band on the national new music map.
B001CC7PPI|5.0|One of the most original films ever made! A man in a wheelchair, with a leg in a cast is trapped in his Greenwich Village one room apartment, watching his neighbours through the window onto a courtyard, during a heat wave in the summer. Sometimes what you see, you don't believe and what you believe you don't see and that can be murder. The set-up and premise of the film is outstanding and completely original. With excellent dialogue and excellently mounted scenes without dialogue, Hitchcock enters the dangerous world of the peeping tom and gives it his masterful twist.
B001F2W4Y2|5.0|Theres not much to say here except that AC/DC are back at the top of their game. This is their best job since 1981s \\" For Those About To Rock ( We Salute You). It couldve been the album that followed that one. The album has some really good rockers on it. It showcases Angus on slide guitar on the song \\" Stormy May Day\\" which is a departure for Angus. This is something that the Boys and Brendan O'Brien ( the albums producer) wanted to do to show some versatility.  He even pushes the limits and the envelope even further and has the boys doing a semi ballad of sorts, on  \\" Rock n Roll Dream \\" .The albums single sparkles \\" Rock n Roll Train\\" will have you humming and singing along just like the old days of\\" Highway to hell\\" and \\"You Shook Me...\\" Sure The album has fillers....i can count only two....Other wise... It is produced just fine by Brendan O Brien who does his best Mutt Lange. Brians voice has not sounded better in years. I dont really know how he did it. The rumor has it they recorded Brian piece meal style on a small recording machine , outside a studio environment. It sure did the trick. I love \\" Black Ice\\" thats all I can say.  I Do miss Bon though and Brian isnt Bon. Its apples and oranges though. At times though. I cant help but wonder how Bon wouldve tackled this album? Thats my only wonder.Otherwise what can i say? BlackIce\\" is a winner . Hey, someone must like it. its selling like hotcakes. Long live Acca Dacca!

0765316897|3.0|Brandon Sanderson did such a wonderful job with the first two books, that the bar was set very high for the finale - and this book just didn't measure up.  Extreme time lapses (between time/events) were ill-explained and left much to the imagination.  The plot line wandered so aimlessly at times that I just could not get into the book at all.  I found myself drifting and having to focus hard just to finish his short chapters, whereas his first books I read in a sitting.    Sanderson would have pleased his audience more with a smoother transition from this 2nd book.  And the ending, well, others have already eluded to it but I think most people will find the ending will leave them subdued and deflated; hardly a recipe to get customers coming back for more.  I hope this book does not portend a similar events as he wraps up the the \\"Wheel of Time\\" series.
B000LB7G00|5.0|This is an amazing product -- we use it to create camera effects in 3D spaces for live shows and recordings in the virtual world environment of Second Life.<br /><br />One you try it, you will never be able to do frame capture work with just the normal mouse.

B001AJVR5M|1.0|An extremely unsatisfying smorgasbord of tepid, dead dull instruments mixed in with haggard teen vocals. I was forced to listen to this immature rubbish on an airplane flight. I was stuck by some individuals wearing headphones and then the Jonas Brothers also appeared on the airplane TV so we were all forced to watch them.<br /><br />If I were to describe it in physiologically terms, it's gut wrenching, like a depressing vacuum inside your guts. There's also an over indulgence in queasiness, then a complete urge to vomit sporadically. The sickness seems to dissipate once you stop listening to it.<br /><br />Seriously, I did not feel well after listening to this and I would highly recommend that any true fans of music, AVOID this. There is nothing worthy or \\"catchy\\" or even redeeming about this.<br /><br />Invest in real music. Franz Ferdinand, Fugazi, Tom Waits, Nick Cave and the Bad Seeds, Modest Mouse, John Coltrane, Ghostland Observatory, Interpol, etc.
B0015HOFZI|4.0|For those of you who thought your vinyl collection would be relegated to the \\"I'll listen to it later\\" pile, check this out. The Sony USB turntable allows you to put your collection onto your MP3 player. Its as easy as listening to a record. The software is pretty intuitive - but you do have to name each track, otherwise you will end up with 1 \\"song\\" per side. That being said, the quality is good - there is a low 'hiss' before each track, but it cant be helped, nor does it detract from the music, (where there is no audible hiss). The slim profile and black color make it easy to fit this unit into your audio center. I have seen similar turntables for 3x the price, but if you are a regular person who doesn't have specific and exacting audiophile needs, this is the turntable for you.
B000S0GYRU|5.0|Suspiria has a very ominous beginning, and great musical score that is not only slightly scary, and used throughout as foreshadowing, but also appropriate for the plot and main character: Suzie, a ballerina traveling from NY to Germany for a dancing scholarship.  Upon arrival to her new academy she encounters an eerie, gruesome murder of a recently expelled student.  Soon thereafter she falls understandably ill after seeing an anonymous, hideous looking woman (picture the offspring of Capt. Lou Albano and an Eastern European bearded-lady carnival worker) who looks after the schoolmaster's creepy, Little Boy Blue nephew.<br /><br />Essentially, the movie breaks down as a mystery; the killer, cause, and source of evil is completely unknown and secretive until the final suspenseful moment.  It's psychotic and seductive, a true horror tale that leaves the exposition as minimal as possible and saturates the senses with prolonged action and climaxes.<br /><br />This is where Argento's reputation is well deserved.  While the story and acting are average, the framing of colors and shadows are wonderful contrasts that can't be avoided; they simply grab a viewer's attention.  The camera angles and scenery are stupendous, with soul piercing close-ups and epic, wide-angle work, each scene is framed with a deliberateness that works perfectly.  At one point a shadow is so masterfully filmed during a chase scene that it appears to be the tormentor or evil entity that seems to be ever-so-elusive in Argento movies.  Brilliant.<br /><br />For those who want to jump into Argento, learn from my mistake and begin with Suspiria; because, Inferno is not where you need to begin.
B0016HNOXQ|3.0|Like so many belated follow ups, the pioneering \\"trip hop\\" act's self-explanatory release feels partially out of touch, but perhaps that has benefits when the experimentation commences in earnest.

When her prayers are answered, however, she begins to suspect the boy who comes back is not her child. Inspired by true events that took place in Los Angeles in the 1920s.

Wes Block) is excellent!    This is an excellent film that is part drama, part thriller, and part mystery. This is a film that makes you think. Angelina Jolie gives an Oscar-worthy performance. Clint's directing is pitch-perfect as usual. This is one of the best films of the year.

B00012FXB8|2.0|I don't know if I've ever seen a sequel that makes so many bad decisions so fast and so early in.  Even before the opening titles were over, I had no idea how this film was going to win the viewer back.<br /><br />Face-huggers get loose in the ship escaping the second rousing film, ALIENS, do their dirty deeds, then die and bleed acid to breach the systems and hulls.  The survivors are jettisoned without ever waking up.  Newt, the adorable little girl from ALIENS, is killed.  Michael Behn's heroic Marine--killed in the crash.  The droid--tilt.  All that's left is Sigourney Weaver and she crash lands on a dreary, dirty prison planet populated with dirty, repellent inmates.<br /><br />All of this in the first five minutes.  Ugh.  On top of all that, they shave Sigourney's hair off and turn one of her eyes blood red.<br /><br />It's almost as if they had a pre-production meeting and asked, \\"How can we ruin the ALIEN franchise?  Let's ugly up the star, fill the movie with the scum of the galaxy....\\"<br /><br />There's a reason this is \\"the least successful in the ALIEN series.\\"
B0002Z0EYK|5.0|Based on Homer's Illiad, there is an ironic connection to how this movie was received.  Some may have been wary of another big-budget Hollywood production, and thought of the classic proverb, \\"beware those who would bring false gifts.\\"  The concern was unwarranted, as this movie is stunning in every way from beginning to end, and PACKED with major players from the ultimate battle movies.  Warriors from [[ASIN:B000Q6GX5Y 300]], [[ASIN:B000654ZK0 The Lord of the Rings]], and [[ASIN:B00003CX95 Braveheart]] all do battle in one movie!<br /><br />Agamemnon (Brian Cox - who was awesome in Braveheart as Argyle Wallace and showed enough range to be hilarious as Captain O'Hagan in [[ASIN:B00005JKMN Super Troopers]]) is a power hungry king who has challenged enough other kings to control most of Greece.  The only land that stands in his way of controlling the Aegean is Troy, ruled by pacifist-leaning Priam (Peter O'Toole).  Boromir from LOTR (Sean Bean) - plays Odysseus, a sycophant king to the now ruler of kings, Agamemnon.  Odysseus just happens to be a mentor and friend to the greatest warrior ever, Achilles (Pitt).  Fighting alongside Achilles is his second-in-command, Eudorus (Vincent Regan).  You will recognize him as the guy who was awesome as Leonidas's captain in 300.<br /><br />As peace is being worked out between Agamemnon's Greek forces and the emerging armies of Troy, two Trojan princes are treated as guests by Agamemnon: Prince Hector (Eric Bana) is his land's greatest warrior; and Prince Paris (Orlando Bloom aka Legolas from LOTR) is his younger, \\"Don Juan\\" brother.  When they leave they have an extra passenger, Helen (Diane Kruger) - who is now \\"of Troy\\" but was once \\"of Sparta\\" - and the peace being discussed is destroyed because she just happens to be married to King Menelaus (Brendan Gleeson - Hamish Campbell from Braveheart), Agamemnon's brother.  Now disgraced, Menelaus gives Agamemnon the reason he needed for war with Troy, a previously unbreached city thought undefeatable.  And, just for good measure, the rugged Campbell father from Braveheart plays Glaucus (James Cosmo), a top soldier in the Trojan Army.<br /><br />If all this is confusing, don't worry; the movie is still great.  Enjoy the epic war scenes similar to the movies from which they have borrowed cast members, tragically snicker at the fact that you know what the \\"Trojan Horse\\" is all about (and that the city of Troy falls to such a ridiculous trick), and revel in a classic sword battle between Achilles and Hector.  Actually, try not to enjoy one battle more than others, because this movie is saturated with great action like Achilles' complete domination of the monstrous Thessalian warrior Boagrius (Nathan Jones aka Petr from [[ASIN:B000SM6FLI The Condemned]]).<br /><br />From beginning to end this movie is superb.  The lighting, acting, scenery, musical score, costume design and casting all reflect impressively on the entire movie's efforts.  I didn't care to go too much into the historical aspect of the movie, but from what I can tell all the major details fairly consistent with the truth.  This is right up there with 300 and Braveheart, and is a can't miss action flick.table.

B000RIWAVW|5.0|I've watched this movie many times over the years. It's creepy and scary, yet it has no gore. If you like horror classics with a good, creepy score, rent it. You'll be satisfied. I would like to buy it and you might, too!

B0013D8LCW|5.0|I loved this movie. This story could be a story about a heterosexual man and woman and  not much of the movie would need to be altered. It is a lovely story, well acted and full of well crafted scenes. I really believe that it does not matter if you are gay or straight,you will fall in love with this movie. It does not manipulate the viewer with a generic gay love/lust story. It is a beautiful simple love story.<br />  Billy
B0006MT314|5.0|Excellent, they have captured the sound from the series. The Creators know what sounds great. Hope there are many more to follow.
B00000099Y|5.0|Stsrt to finish, this is fantastic piece of work.   I put it up there with Stones (Sticky Fingers and Exile), Who (Who's Next), Zep (I, II, or IV).  Not a bad track on the whole disk.  A Landmark.  We listen to this at work, and it is simply known as \\"The Album.\\"  Hey, Gus, what's next?  I think I'll put on \\"The Album\\" again.    Buy it.
0792163710|5.0|\\"Shane\\" is a Western with a good story behind it.  It presents the tale of a gunslinger wanting to cast off his past and joins up with a family of peaceful settlers.  Unfortunantly, a powerful local man wants to keep the range open instead of having settlers move in and make claims.  He eventually send for a hired gun (Jack Palance in a famous villianous performance).  Meanwhile, the young boy in the family begins to look up to Shane as a role model which is both good and bad.  Eventually, the film moves towards the showdown in which Shane realizes he must confront the bad guys.    Unlike some westerns, \\"Shane\\" doesn't rely on being full of shootouts.  In fact the body count is fairly low at four confirmed and one maybe.  It instead utilizes the drama of the story.  Shane's character is noteworthy too as he uses violence only when he fears it is necessary.  In one sense, the film has been noted to present an idealized Old West.  However, it also was noted as being an early Western to utilize good sound effects with firearms and the scene in which Palance guns down a generally good character (who's temper got the best of him) conveys dark violence without much visible bloodshed.  Overall, a good film.
B001ECE6C6|5.0|Take some of Pat's best compositions and replace the melody usually carried by guitar with Jopek's lovely voice singing in her own language and wow!  Of course, Pat's distinctive playing shows up throughout.  Like most of PM's work, the more I listen, the more I enjoy it.
B000001GPX|3.0|The Fifth is marvelus. Played very good, one of the all-time best, but he failed in the seventh. The Allegretto is TOO fast, too rushed. Played like they have too hurry. Tempo in the second movment in the seventh syphonis is vrong for me. Buy it for the fifth, not for the seventh.
6305736650|4.0|Casablanca is generally considered to be on of the greatest films of all time. After watching it i can certainly some evidence for it but i'm not sure if i would necessarily hold it in that high regard.<br /><br />I think a large part of my opinions of this movie come from the fact that it is an older movie and many movies have been influenced directly from it. Watching in today, much of the story, particularly the romance, seemed comical simply because i had seen it used so often. Admittedly, before i saw it i was expecting to not like it at all but luckily i did enjoy most of it. First and foremost i really appreciated the writing. The dialogue, especially between Rick and captain Renault, was both entertaining and intelligent. I found myself enjoying the political intrigue in the film much more than the romance.<br /><br />I was certainly impressed with this movie. Mostly because of the writing and setting. though I wouldn't call this the greatest film ive ever seen it does deserve most of the credit it receives.
1591841992|2.0|The author definitely has some good points, I definitely agree that making things more visual can help a lot of times, but come on, 300 pages for that? it would have been a great book if it only had 100 concrete pages but the fact that it is so long goes directly against what he is preaching... I don't think is worth it's money. Don't buy it.
B00003CXA6|5.0|\\"Gettysburg\\" is a film best watched in parts as it is very long (it needed to be lenghty though).  This is one of the most accurate civil war films I have seen and an impressive number of reeactors were used in some of the battle scenes.  Picket's Charge is particullarly well filmed as is the fighting on Little Round Top.  Not all of the battle could be covered even in this epic and the cavalry battle on July third is excluded.  The musical score is very appropriate and the film has a fine collection of actors.  Jeff Daniels, Martin Sheen, Sam Elliot, and Tom Berenger portray their characters well and surprisingly, all of these four except Elliot look a lot like the historical figures they are portraying.  The other actors generally do a good job as well.  Overall, \\"Glory\\" is still my favorite Civil War film as a movie, but \\"Gettysburg\\" is superb in its own right and unlike many Hollywood films seems fairly accurate.
B00097DXZS|2.0|First let me say, I'm a big fan of 70's classic rock.  I can't help it- I just love the music from that decade.    Now, going into THIS album, I wasn't expecting Santana to have the ability to release another Caravanserai, or another Borboletta (or my personal favorite- Love, Devotion, Surrender with John McLaughlin).      If only I could find the words to describe how shocked I was upon playing some of these songs for the first time.  THIS is the new Santana?  No, no way.  I refuse to believe it.  I refuse to believe this kind of disappointing career turn is even possible for such a legendary guitarist.  I refuse to believe Santana would change his sound and songwriting style as drastically as *this* album would suggest.    Maybe this album is some kind of quick cash-in joke, or maybe Santana is desperate to stay in the spotlight for as long as possible.  I love the mans music *so much* that I can't possibly give All That I Am a 1-star rating.  Oh you better believe I'm tempted to, but I won't.  The guy obviously has some enormous talent with his ability to shift from bringing me to tears to making me very happy.  Not many guitarists can change my emotions like Santana can.  With that said, this is NOT an album I recommend.  Not at all.      Buy Caravanserai, Welcome, or ANYTHING from the 70's before buying this.  Please!  We can only hope one day Santana goes back to those experimental 70's days and releases something truly incredible.
B000BB14YY|4.0|I enjoyed watching ran. it was quite different than most American films in a lot of ways. it had an unique combination of humor and drama. I particularly liked the large battle scenes. i think a lot of the epic battle scenes in movies that i like now were heavily influenced by this film. this film has an interesting mix of both American and foreign film styles. The influence of Japanese Noh theater is clearly strong. While some American audiences might be put off by some aspects of the film, i still think it reaches a wide, diverse audience nonetheless.
B000002J1Y|5.0|I can't believe I was 13 when this came out and I was at the record store laying out grass cutting money for my first and only 3 record set. The music seemed so complicated back then but I was very drawn to it-listening again and again. I knew I was in the presence of genius and that hasn't changed one bit in all these years. By far my favorite Yes recording.
B001F2W4Y2|3.0|Black Ice is not really a bad AC/DC album, but the opportunity for it to be a great one really was missed. The basics of the songs are there, even if the riffs are often recycled. The problem is that while the songs are intially catchy enough with decent riffing, they do not build a momentum and rather just flatline halfway through. I keep listening through the album and trying to decide what a good first single would have been (rather than Rock n Roll Train) but there really aren't any candidates that meet the standard.    Rock n Roll Train is basically a Highway to Hell rewrite but rather than build into the classic that Highway to Hell does, RnR Train dies after the first chorus. This is the problem with all of the better songs on here. They get your foot tapping along to a great riff, then the song dies.    Another issue is the quality of the lyrics. The lyrics have been pretty poor since the Youngs started penning them in 1990 but here they are pretty much nonsensical. They are truly awful and it is to the detriment of the album. They really just seem like random lines thrown in here and there with references to storms, decibels, liking rock n roll etc. The lyrics during both the Bonn Scott and Brian Johnson writing eras both had their clever moments, even if the subject matter was nothing too meaningful    So, I say this was a missed opportunity to do a great album. If more time were spent shaping the songs beyond the intro, verse, chorus, verse, chorus, end structure and if Brian (or anyone in the band) had at least helped with the lyrics it could have been so much better. Thre should only have been 10 songs and the album should have been called Decibel. It's not a great song but it sounds like an AC/DC album title. Black Ice is a nonesense song and a nonesense title.    The best thing on the album is Cliff Williams. His bass is pushed right up front and he gets to do a few riffs for a change.    The album is better than Ballbreaker but not as good as anything that came before it. I never bought Stiff Upper Lip after being burned by Ballbreaker so I can't comment on that one.    3 stars because there are some good tunes on hear. No classics, unfortunately.
B000YABYLA|5.0|This is *exactly* the perfect movie for someone like me.  Simple movies like this one, with a relaxing story, and easy to follow twists, all while taking place in a small town.  Admit it, that's why you love movies too :)    It was just a lot of fun watching it, and seeing all the popular faces as the story rolled along.  I used to love Arrested Development, and was surprised to see the father and son from that show both playing major roles in the movie, and of course, the beautiful Jennifer Garner, and the best surprise of all, the teenage daughter, who was the lead actrees, named Ellen Page.  She was funny, witty, and interesting the entire time.  I loved her role and expect to see more of her in the future.    A VERY good movie.
B00005JPS8|5.0|One of the best movies the summer of 08 gave us! Robert Downey Jr. has made an amazing come back to films. Jon Favreau has brought the armored avanger to life! The sequel will hopefully be just as amazing!

0143038419|5.0|When I'm reading a book and find myself wanting to become the main character's best friend, I know this is a great book. That's what happened to me with this book, I was constantly thinking how much I liked this person (in this case the book's author) and how much I would enjoy going out for coffee and having a conversation with her.     I wasn't sure about reading this book after the reviews I read here. In fact, I had it on my wish list and took it off after reading some of the reviews. However, one of my closest friends read it recently and as soon as she finished she said \\"you have to read this book, you are going to love it!!\\". This is a person who doesn't read much and who hasn't enjoyed many books. This is also a person who knows me extremely wel. As soon as she said that to me I went out and bought it. Actually, my friend was going to lend it to me but her mother was reading it and I really needed a new book so I went out and bought it instead. I'm so glad I did! I ended up putting post its all over it, pointing out passages that I liked or related with, and I'm glad to own a book that I'm sure I will return to many times.    I liked how Gilbert wanted to find inner peace without giving up on some of life's most superficial and guilty pleasures. This is something I have constantly thought about as well, and it has actually prevented me from going deeper into my own spiritual journey for the fear of not being \\"spiritual\\" enough, of not being able to unattach myself from the more superficial things in life, that I must admit I thoroughly enjoy. I also liked that I was able to relate to the anxiety she feels at realizing she doesn't want many of the things society thinks a woman should want, such as children. I felt I was listening to a close friend talk about herself, the way us girls do, sometimes being very deep and transendental and at other times completely superficial and silly.     I understand that this book (as it happens with any book, really) is notfor everyone. For those who enjoy deeper, more spiritual memoirs Gilbert will seem completely shallow and self-indulgent. For those who always wonder whether a spiritual life can go alongside the simpler pleasures of life, you will find in this book many of the questions you have already once asked yourself. In my experience, this was a wonderful and inspiratonal book. I have not liked a book so much in a long time.
0446579939|5.0|Nicholas Sparks has done it again! This book was absolutely incredible and was worth every penny! I would highly recommend this book to anyone who loves his books or anyone who appreciates a good love story. As always, I couldn't put this book down and was so sad that it had to end. I cannot wait for his next book!
B0000549B0|5.0|Harevey is one of our favorite classics!  First, it is Jimmy Stewart, one of the best actors ever!  Then it is a great story - who is really crazy - maybe all of us a little.  And if we're not, maybe we need to be a little crazy so we don't miss out on the most important things in life!  Watch it!
B001E75QGG|2.0|The movie was OK, certainly not as good as the others.  However the biggest problem is if your Blue Ray player/TV connects together using Component cables you will only see 480i.  Paramount has apparently disabled the HD output unless an HDMI cable is used.  Recommend you buy the standard DVD if your setup needs Component cables.  I have never seen this issue on any other disks.
B000N3SSVM|5.0|The Knife have said themselves that \\"Silent Shout\\" has come much closer to the kind of music they have had in mind than their previous albums.  And what hauntingly beautiful minds they have.  I wont elaborate on the album itself because if you're considering this deluxe edition you have most likely purchased or obtained the album already.  But to receive a DVD of their live show/experience in Gothenburg, Sweden and  all of their music videos along with a CD recording of the live show is a real treat.  Very affordable considering the content and highly recommended to anyone that can identify with this type of music.  Buy it and savor it.
B0019T9FL6|1.0|Just to echo what many others have said -- these are lousy songs that are completely unworthy of J.H.'s wonderful voice.  I don't even think \\"Spotlight\\" is very good! Her record label had an opportunity for a Whitney Houston-type blockbuster, with an audience already in place, eagerly awaiting this album -- and they totally blew it.  I'm especially surprised that Clive Davis couldn't do a better job.
B0019FOC5E|5.0|After seeing the movie we just had to have the soundtrack. My wife and I have the music on our MP3 players and listen to it whenever we feel a need to be cheered up. The music is so uplifting we expect to be listening to it years from now.
B0011N1WE8|4.0|I'm a sucker for a good fairy tale and 'Penelope' is one of the best I've seen in years. Ricci is perfect in the title role and although she has a pig's nose, strangely she remains attractive in this quirky love story! What I loved about this film was the more you get to know her character, the more her bizarre disfigurement just didn't matter. There's a great message here about acceptance and how self esteem can alter the way people perceive you, but unfortunately the DVD is a bit of a bummer. There aren't many extras and there are scenes cut and shortened from the film at least how it was viewed over seas. I didn't see this film in theaters, so I'm not quite sure what exactly has been changes. It would have been nice to offer a 2 disc edition with both versions of the film and more extra material.
B0015AARJI|5.0|If you had the ps2 dualshock2 controller then nothing is going to change that much. The dualshock3 gives pretty strong vibration for being wireless, comparable to the dualshock2. I know for a fact that a full charge will last at least 7 hours (I haven't tested beyond 7 hours). It's a fair bit heavier than the normal ps3 sixaxis controllers as you might expect. The only real cons I can think of is that Sony should have rolled these babies out with the release of the ps3, and the price.
B000006TG7|5.0|I bought the the Australian release of Let There be Rock for one reason: Crabsody in Blue.  This rarity is well-worth the money you will have to pay to get this excellent album.  AC/DC at its finest.  Crabsody in Blue contains a melodic verse and a buildup with that bluesy growl that sends shivers down any true AC/DC fan's spine.  Beautiful track that showcases the lyrical entendres of Scott and the Young Brothers' awesomely vintage tone.
B00168HARG|5.0|This is a great show and says true to the story of Terminator. I read somewhere that they might tie this show with the new Terminator movie said to be out this coming summer.

B001ED7C58|4.0|I agree that there aren't that many big name artists on the soundtrack - but that's what is making it so appealing to me. Not going to lie, my first impressions of the album were very disappointing, but now that I've listened to the full album at least 5x through it's beginning to grow on me!! I love the unusual songs that aren't typically played on the radio every hour.<br /><br />One song that I HATED off the bat was Bella's Lullaby, because face it, we all expected it to be solely on piano (because Edward wrote and played it by himself)-- not an orchestra piece like the soundtrack has. But like I said, the more and more I listen to it, the more I'm beginning to like it. :)<br /><br />Keep in mind this movie is unlike others, it's not a Disney flick with little kid actors - therefore the soundtrack isn't going to be a compilation of today's Top 40.<br /><br />Get over all your preconceived notions of what you think the soundtrack should be like and give it a chance. Just like everyone hated Rob in the beginning when he was cast as Edward - if you give it a chance it will grow on you just like he did.<br /><br />:) Peace, Love & Twilight!

0345495004|3.0|Loving Frank fictionalizes the love affair between Frank Lloyd Wright and his mistress Mamah Cheney, a union that scandalized the world. Mamah is a woman who prizes ideas and personal freedom over convention and subservience, but sadly, she also prizes this above motherhood, and they leave behind their marriages and a tribe of children to go abroad together. This brings scorn upon them from every direction. Whereas Frank is condemned for being merely naughty, she is deemed perverse.The novel paints an accurate portrait of anti-feminist social mores of America, prone to a busy-body, indignant hypocrisy, then as now. Horan does a mainly predictable job with this material.    The flaw in this book is the lack of spark! The writing, and the characterizations are dull and insipid.Wright's genius is treated like an encyclopedia subject, the reader has to be told, not shown;  we feel none of his fire. Mamah, is portrayed as his thoughtful and provocative equal,but we have to take it on faith, because she doesn't seem to be more than a foil for his narcisissm and excess.    Frankly, I was bored.

0446677450|4.0|This book is pretty good because the basics it mentions are fairly good.  Its true that 90% of America does not know the different between a true asset and a liability. Financial money management is missing from most of education. If you listen to Dave Ramsey, he says many of the same things.    As for the tax advice and deferrments in this book, I wouldn't bet the farm on it. Yes, things like 1031 do exist but some of the advice like buying a corporate car with a personal corporation is illegal(although the accounting advisor at H&R block did inform me last year before I read the book that deducting mileage and gas on my car was a legal option). You can defer taxes forever on a few things, but not many of them and overall, taxes in America are progressive, not regressive as the author claims.     I did learn and was reminded of many important principles by this book and book series, but I'd take a much closer look at tax law before deducting anything.
B000NA28IE|5.0|I disagree with most of the few reviews I read here. I loved this movie. It is probably true that the movie doesn't follow the book as closely as the diehard fans would have liked but for someone who hasn't read the book (but would like to), but loves movies, it was great. The moment in the movie where Eragon asks Saphira if she's ready and she breathes out a blast of fire has stuck with me more than any other part of the movie because it said more than any triumphant \\"YES!\\" could have.
0312379293|2.0|Good story, but laborious to read!  Perhaps typical of Brit style, but I found myself wanting to cut lines off of every page.  If this could be edited down to its essentials I would enjoy the tale.  Overwrought.
B0000549B0|5.0|One comment, I'm not sure Harvey was imaginary, I know several people who swear they've seen him.  Evidently he is a friend to rumpots.  Stewart himself said people, usually men, looking a little down on their luck, asked him about Harvey for years!
B0016Q2D5M|5.0|Brendan Frasier stars in this loose adaptation of the classic Jules Verne novel by the same name.  Frasier stars as Trevor Anderson, a college professor who teaches plate tectonics and volcanism.  He is kidded by his colleagues because he only has two students in his class.  Ten years earlier, Trevor's brother went off to prove that the assumptions made by Verne in his novel were actually true.  Trevor has also agreed to take in his nephew Sean (Josh Hutcherson) for the summer.  Trevor share his beliefs about the center of the earth with Sean.  Soon, the two are off to Iceland to track down a possible entry to the center of the earth.    Once in Iceland, Sean and Trevor meet Hannah (Anita Briem).  Hannah is the daughter of a dead Icelandic professor whom Trevor's brother was working with.  It is possible that the two may have indeed found the entryway described by Verne.  Hannah agrees to be Trevor's guide and take him to the possible entry site.  Once there, Trevor discovers a piece of scientific apparatus and retrieves it, but a severe lightning storm strikes, forcing Trevor to drop the apparatus and run to the safety of a nearby cave.  Unfortunately, Trevor, Hannah, and Sean are trapped when a large rockslide covers the entrance, but they did indeed find the entrance to the center of the earth, for soon, they are careening down an abandoned mineshaft in coal cars.  Then, they fall through a thin layer of rock and, just as in Verne's novel, find themselves at the center of the earth.    But, once there, Hannah makes a sobering discovery; she find's Trevor's deceased brother.  After burying him, Trevor, Hannah, and Sean must find a way back to the surface before the underground temperature gets too hot.  Along the way, they encounter some nasty sea creatures, a very scary T-Rex, and some hungry carnivorous plants.  Their only hope is to reach a vent which leads to the surface, but this vent is located on the far side of a vast underwater ocean.  Will the three adventurers make it before its too late?    This is an excellent movie.  Brendan Frasier is excellent in his role, and Josh Hutcherson and Anita Briem are very good as well.  The special effects are first-rate, and there are several exciting moments in the movie, including the T-Rex chase, the journey across the underground ocean, and the thrilling ride in the mine cars.    I give this great movie my highest recommendation.  It does a good job of combining adventure and comedy.  Viewers familiar with Jules Verne's story will surely enjoy this fine movie.
B00006F83Y|5.0|Huge fan of this band. I think this is their masterpiece to date (all albums including Era Vulgaris). Album by album, they seem to alter their sound a little; adding some ambience here, some texture there, new sounds, etc. This album captures all the elements of their sound in one package and it's the ish. I highly recommend this album to anyone who has ears and can hear.
B000U1ZV8K|5.0|The first one is great  The second one is good  The third one is ok  The forth one is so so    MEL IS AWSOME NO MATTER WHAT!!!
B000PKG6TE|3.0|QOTSA is my favorite band out. Their albums through the years has evolved and morphed adding more laying and depth to the sound each time around. I think their pinnacle musically was Songs for the Deaf. Everything that they do just seemed to come together on that one. Anyway, this album continues their journey through music. It seems to go into a industrial type sound (a la- NIN) more this time around on a couple songs. It's only a couple songs though (battery acid, turnin on a screw). I'm not mad at them for continuing to expand their sound. It's just not exactly my cup of tea. It's still got some good stuff on their that drives hard (3s and 7s, run pig run, river in the road) and some that are more 'melodic' (I'm designer, into the hollow, suture up my future). It's really not a bad album; I just miss the older sound a little and I'm a pretty tough critic on the artists that I like.

0780626494|3.0|Blast From the Past starring Brendan Fraser, Alicia Silverstone, Sissy Spacek, and Christopher Walken is a funny and interesting film but I haven't got a clue what happened at the end of the film, which makes this feature unmemorable. Great acting and plot but this film didn't grab right away, some of the dialogue is a bit corny. This film isn't horrible just not brilliant.
B000F0UUT6|5.0|This is by far the best version of \\"Pride and Prejudice\\".  I believe I have seen every one of them and none compares.  Laurence Olivier was great of course as Darcy, but Colin Firth has completely captured the character.  I doubt that any one will ever be able to portray Darcy better.    I am extremely satified that I purchased the 10th Anniversary Collector's Edition even though I all ready had the original DVD of the same produecton. It is definitely well worth the price. I strongly recommend it to every one.  The DVDs come in a beautifully designed case, and I thoroughly enjoyed the accompanying behind-the-scenes disc.  Even though Colin Firth and Jennifer Ehle were busy making other movies and could not be on it, the remaining cast members were very entertaining.  The accompanying book, \\"The Making of Pride and Prejudice\\" gave wonderful insights to the production. It is extremely well written and full of delightful pictures.  If you are a fan, even if you have never seen Pride and Prejudice--do not pass up this one.  I do not understand the complaints submitted in several of the other reviews about the color of the film or it's not having subtitles. My 50\\" television was set at the factory suggested controls, and the color in the DVD was superb!  The \\"woods\\" were so green and lush it made you feel as if you were actually there with Elizabeth. As far as the subtitles are concerned, I simply hit the \\"mute\\" button on my television remote control, and the subtitles were there.

B00081912E|4.0|The Mask was one of those childhood defining movies for me. At the age I was, I became enthralled with cartoons and the animation process. The idea of a live action cartoon was just enough of a high concept idea to get my little 10 year old mind excited!! For years I had wondered if cartoon characters really existed in our 3D world what would they look like? How would they be lighted? Would the squashing and stretching work and look right?    Luckily the mask answered that question for me! The then almost unheard use of CGI in film making was used to almost astonishing affect in this movie. I still think for some reason that these effects are some of the best seen in CGI enhanced movies. Even for the \\"cartoony\\" effect that the film makers were going for, to see that they pulled the squashing and stretching effect early on is quite impressive.    The film itself is actually very good. It ignited the careers of both Jim Carrey and the very stunning 19 year old Cameron Diaz. The actors bring \\"A\\" game to this film and that's really impressive considering it to be very early efforts on their parts. These are the parts I admire each actor for the most.   The internal drama that Stanley Ipkuss experiences is fairly engaging because many people relate to feelings of inadequacy and introversion and sometimes the wish of somehow \\"busting out\\" and \\"letting loose\\" takes on surprising constructs. This movie offers one fantastic and fanciful version of that wish which we see manifested in the cursed mask of Loki giving its wearer the ability to physically transform into their subconscious character. Its one of the zaniest uses of psychological experimentation you'll find on film. Most of all it's a fun as all heck movie that's hilarious and quotable from beginning to end. It belongs in anyone's library.
B001ECQ75A|5.0|What a lovely movie!  It teaches a very simple lesson, but does so in such a beautiful way, that you don't realize it at the time.  It's hilarious and touching, witty and  moving.  The artwork is incredibly beautiful, too, and should win an oscar, along with the music, which was a nice blend of Chinese and Western themes.<br />All in all, a wonderful movie that you and your children should DEFINITELY watch!
B00005JPS8|5.0|Even as recent as 2006, the super hero sub genre of film had been losing steam. X-men 3 ended up being a joke. Superman Returns was 40 minutes too long and ended up making him a confused and ineffectual moron with a school boy crush that has an illegitimate son. The Fantastic Four movies were too juvenile to be taken seriously and the lord of the new superhero generation, Spiderman, became a jazzy, emotional clown in Spiderman 3.    Longtime and loyal fans were very upset and the uninitiated millions who did not keep up with comics were simply unimpressed. The start of 2008 brought uncertainty for future of these films. The first bastion of hope came in the form of a film adaptation of a rather unknown superhero. Ironman was the story of weapons developer Tony Stark who after receiving a near fatal wound in his chest, creates a super powered suit of armor that allows him to fly and shoot lasers. The teaser trailer to Ironman created a tremendous amount of buzz. Longtime fans were more than excited. They seemed to be almost transformed by the divine touch. Casual movie goers seemed also excited and wanted to finally learn of this strange unpopular character. But as is the usual order of the industry, a good trailer does not ensure a good movie. Some people were skeptical, others hopeful of the movies success and impact. By May of that year everyone got their answer. Ironman opened to world wide acclaim and critical praise.    The movie was a qualified success and gave fans a new hero to rally behind. Unlike earlier efforts by film makers, Ironman delivered its origin story with a healthy sense of character logic and maturity. Gone was the eye winking kitsch and glitz of the past superhero fair. Teenage angst was replaced with middle aged angst and Robert Downey delivered a very confident and nuanced character even before he strapped on the armor. This incredibly kinetic and impossibly agile character was getting down and dirty in warzones that seemed straight out ofCNN. This was a different superhero that was facing challenges of our modern world. Considering the current geo-political climate of our time, Ironman was a living breathing sensationalized pop hero critique for our times. The character was a faceless power fantasy vehicle that allowed the viewer to become Ironman and sort of work out their own resolute in a world that doesn't seem to pay attention to the common man. \\"What would I do with a super powered suit of armor?\\" Blow up terrorists apparently seemed to be the answer given and audiences loved it.    Unfortunately, the movie degrades from its originally laid out premise of a socially conscious superhero and reverts back to a formulaic climatic battle between Ironman and a \\"bigger Ironman\\" as Stark's armor becomes reverse engineered by his closest business ally. This is sort of where Ironman becomes less perfect as it goes for the cheap thrill ending of a battle between two titans which is how most of these movies seem to end anyway. The movie shies away from Ironman really solving this problem as he was so set on bringing an end to terrorism in the first place. Of course it is only the first movie and it ain't comics without a big ol' robot rumble.    Luckily this movie was a great primer for casual fans and had some of the biggest fan service of any of the superhero movies. This movie had tremendous respect for the source material and any changes made in the movie really helped the story along without putting off the fans. If anything, it improved the Ironman premise for this era.     The DVD package is impressive too with a really good amount of behind the scenes extras to keep geeks enamored for hours. A truly special film and DVD that deserves a place in any library.
B001D08SK0|4.0|Like the subject says, the music speaks for itself. The packaging gets a point off for the way they slide the CDs & DVD into slits in the LP cover.     But the WORST part about all this is the way it gets packaged by Amazon for shipping. NO PADDING WHATSOEVER. My order came in an oversized box with the Kind of Blue box just floating around inside. Luckily, there was only minor damage to one of the corners (if I returned it for that, the replacement could arrive in worse condition, so I'm gonna live wiith it - it's not THAT bad, but still...).    I'm not sure why Amazon does this with vinyl orders, but it's something to keep in mind if you're planning on ordering any vinyl from them. I just received the new Ryan Adams release on vinyl from them - same thing, no padding at all. Luckily that one arrived safely.    Buyer beware if you're purcahsing vinyl from Amazon......

B0004Z33EQ|1.0|Rambo (Sylvester Stallone) is emancipated by Col. Trautman (Richard Crenna) from the prison camp where he is serving time and sent back to Nam to gather evidence of the existence of POWs.  Problem is, the \\"government,\\" as embodied by a square-jawed tool named Marshall Murdock (Charles Napier), doesn't want anyone to be found.    This stunningly illogical piece of garbage trots out all the reliable boogeymen of Cold War Reagan-era America: evil Russians, loathsome Asians, and two-faced bureaucrats (government is the problem).  I'm not sure that Rambo's mission even makes any sense except perhaps as a piece of intra-governmental propaganda since a convicted criminal's failure to find evidence of abandoned MIAs could hardly be expected to be persuasive to the general public.  Rambo's enemies conveniently show up where needed so that they can fall into his clutches, and the two Russians who torture Rambo, a lieutenant colonel (Steven Berkoff) and his sadistic henchman (Voyo Goric), also turn out to be the two helicopter pilots that he faces in a dogfight later.  The filmmakers have loads of fun blowing up a Vietnamese village, which would no doubt result in the deaths of numerous peasants, thereby demonstrating why the natives might not be so appreciative of our efforts to \\"liberate\\" them.

Click Submit below to finish entering your review.<br />Submit<br />Review preferences: (edit)<br />Name: Dr Jacques COULARDEAU<br />Location: Olliergues, France<br /><br />Preview:<br />Summary: We are all the mythical fish of some one else<br />*** This review may contain spoilers ***<br /><br />The film is well done and we can see here and there some images that are recalling elements of other films by Tim Burton, like an image resembling the basic image of The Nightmare Before Christmas. There are many more, well, at least a few. That's the sign of a man who wants to build a complete set of films, that is able to connect his films with some bonds and strings to make them a whole and not just isolated tit bits. But more than that the film also uses allusions to works that are not Tim Burton's. We definitely cannot miss the allusion to Twilight Zone in that village lost in the forest and we automatically think it must be a village beyond life, hence the hero must have died along the way, maybe with the jumping spiders. We will only know it is not the case at the very end of the film.<br /><br />The first problem touched by Tim Burton is the absence of relation between a son and a father because the father always told stories and after the happy age of six or seven children know what a story is and that it is not true. But the father was always telling his own story of what had happened to him though it was wrapped up in such a bazaar of useless things, useless because unreal but essential because the father lived in them, such a bazaar of strange things that the son came to the point of being embarrassed by the stories because he could not believe in them and was ashamed by his father telling what he considered lies. They were lies for him and in fact they were stories for everyone else and the father was a story teller, a man who was able to provide others with dreams. It took the son quite a few days visiting his father after several years of complete non-communication, when the father was in the process of dying, for the son to understand that in fact the father was happy and made people around him happy, including himself and his son, by telling these &#34;false stories&#34; that were true to ,his heart, to his mind, to his being himself even if it is in a field of daffodils, thousands and thousands of daffodils, which is the purest lie you can imagine, especially on the quadrangle of a college campus.<br /><br />The lesson for the son is that he was embarrassed because HE was seeing these stories as lies, because he considered he could not know his father, reach out to him.<br /><br />But the lesson about the father is a lot more interesting. It is a lesson for everyone. It is what Tim Burton is doing all the time to us. The stories are absolutely true, including in the impossible elements because they reveal the man who is telling them. Tim Burton is his films and we have the right to consider that his films are transparent loincloths of various colors that reveal all that should be hidden, at least in public. The stories a man, a film maker is telling are the blood and flesh and some other fluids of the man and the film maker.<br /><br />This is a crazy idea but a beautiful consideration. One cannot tell one's private activities in bed, in the bedroom or wherever. But One can always tell some stories about some events that happened to him that are a metaphor of his most intimate and perverse and masochistic and sadistic impulses he cannot satisfy in any way. Here the Circus master is a werewolf. How silly, but how true about a man who is an exploiter of people right down and through till he gets to their life itself and who can set up the death of a small circus person so that it becomes a reason for the circus to be famous or infamous. What about putting your head in a lion's mouth? Courage? For sure. But the masteris going to save some money if the lion bites because he has insurance and the circus will be more than famous. So a werewolf or not?<br /><br />The son will understand that so well in the last minutes of his father's life that he will tell his father what will happen after his death but just five minutes before, as a story of his escape and rejuvenation, renascence, salvation: in the story he will become the legendary big fish he has never been able to catch. A man is the stories he tells. A woman maybe too, but Tim Burton hardly deals with women, hardly knows women, hardly dares to say anything about women, or so little, so far at least.<br /><br />That's what makes this film touching and sensitive but is that a philosophy, a catharsis, a sublimation of one's evil or is it a lie, a pure lie, an illusion thrown to the masses to be their new opium?<br /><br />I will not choose and be sure I consider opium as a respectable means to meditate on one's alienation by hooking up on this addictive habit. It is a real choice and so many people get into alcoholism or drug addiction just not to have to choose between sublimation and meditation, catharsis and lying.<br /><br />Dr Jacques COULARDEAUn famous.

1592332803|5.0|I got this as a wedding gift for a friend who is allergic to eggs and dairy. I got to take a look at the book and was impressed for a few reasons. The beginning has a section on how to substitute things for eggs and milk. They suggest one way if you are making something like cookies, and another way if you are baking breads. It would help people modify favorite family recipes that they would not otherwise be able to make. Also, these recipes looked really good! Not just crunchy granola stuff, but stuff any kid (or kid at heart) would like to eat.
B001IYYIZU|5.0|It is no wonder that there was a bidding war for Diane Setterfield's first novel.  Ms Setterfield, a former academic, weaves a tale of suspense and mystery in this 21st century gothic novel.  Margaret Lea, lives in the world of books.  She is shocked to be invited to write the biography of the most famous novelist of modern times, Vida Winter.  However, Ms Winter is known for never giving an accurate biograpy with \\"ninteen different versions... in the past two years alone\\".  But both protagonists are stuggling with hearing and telling the truth of their own stories and so begins a wonderfully engrossing novel.  The voices on the cd are full and real and greatly add to the feel of the times.  Thouroghly enjoyed it and didn't want it to end.

B000HIVOI2|4.0|I saw this film in theaters years ago, and just viewed it on BD. The story includes all of the elements that make an interesting sci-fi flick, and it includes a dash of romance. The storyline of the \\"passageway\\" between dimensions is not unique, but since the film was released several years ago, I would need to say that it still stands up today in terms of relevance.<br /><br />It manages to be a sci-fi film, while still focusing on the core concept, which is not really laden with special effects, but rather pulls the watcher in with a mind bending concept. Though many scientific explanations of bending time and space are absent, the story still unfolds in an engaging manner. The film did seem a bit long and drawn out in parts, and in comparison with more recent sci-fi flicks, which seem to rely on non-stop action, as opposed to complex storylines, some may find this one a bit \\"drawn out\\". However, if you are more interested in an interesting film, this one may be for you.<br /><br />PQ 3.5/5, sound 4/5. Lionsgate is not known for its transfers, but given the age of the film, detail, color and blacks were still rich. For the sake of providing detail, a 50\\" Panasonic Plasma and PS3 80 GB was used to view the film, at a 15 ft distance.
B000Q3648S|5.0|Thurston Moore and Lee Ranaldo are the greatest dual lead guitarists since Television's Verlaine and Lloyd (Apologies to Iron Maiden and Judas Priest.). Kim Gordon and especially Steve Shelley's work on this masterpiece of the second worst decade of rock are great as well. Every song on here is, at the very least, good, and most are fantastic. Even \\"Providence\\" has the beautiful piano part.    \\"Teen Age Riot,\\" \\"Silver Rocket,\\" \\"Eric's Trip,\\" \\"Hey Joni,\\" \\"Candle,\\" that's all that needs to be said. Buy this freaking album. Sonic Youth are, without a doubt, the best band of the late 80's/early 90's. Daydream Nation is by far their best work, and this reissue gives you the best quality possible for an underground treasure. Buy it, play it, love it.

Even though some readers may be disappointed at the way certain dramatic conflicts are resolved (spoiler alert: no giant bloodbaths or fight-to-the-death between Jacob and Edward), I thought that Ms. Meyer came up with solutions that were definitely in line with the plot so far and were able to give the majority of readers a happy ending. Two thumbs up :)

0393330435|2.0|I just finished reading iWoz last night and I have to say that I was extremely dissapointed.<br /><br />This book offers advice at the end, almost as an afterhought.  If Wozniak wanted to make the book more interesting it would have served him better to turn the last chapter into a phamplet and sell that.<br /><br />Reading through this book you will find several digs at Steve Jobs.  Immediately I realized that Woz is quite bitter and resentful against Jobs.<br /><br />There is no doubt in my mind about Woz's intelligence and what he has created but he talks about it in such a boastful way that it begins to become draining.  \\"I was the first to do this, I was the first to do that\\" over and over again.<br /><br />What I realized at the end of the book is that Wozniak has taken everything he has for granted.  He forgets what while he may have invented many things he would not have financially benefited from ANY of it without Apple and without Jobs.  He would still be a engineer at HP in their calculator division had OTHERS not worked with him.  He rarely credits others for getting him where he is today.<br /><br />My opinion of Steve Wozniak was much higher BEFORE I read this book.  Unfortunately this book made me see what kind of person Steve Wozniak is, perhaps this is why he's burnt through so many wives.  He's arrogant, self-centered and egotistical.  Perhaps if you want a lesson in how to be thankless to those who've helped you reach much success you should give this book a read.<br /><br />While Woz claims he did this book to 'set the story straight' it reads more like a last ditch attempt at not being forgotten.

B001DHE9KG|3.0|I had enthusiastically looked forward to this live HD transmission and attended the performance at a local movie theatre.  While there is much to enjoy in this version, the shortcomings left me with an overall lukewarm impression.<br /><br />A big disappointment for me was the transposition of Rudolfo's famous aria, Che gelida manina, down a half step so that it peaks at a high B instead of a C.  This is as good of a place as any to explain why I think transposition in a piece such as La Boheme just does not work.  Puccini used an almost \\"through-composed\\" style in his operas (following the lead of Wagner), which means all of the musical moments are seamlessly attached.  Key transitions, of course, are essential for the piece to come off as a unified whole.  When one section is changed, as is the case here, the whole scene suffers.  Even my brother, an avid Boheme fan but almost totally unschooled musically, remarked to me, \\"Something doesn't sound right.\\"  Of course it doesn't. It's not that I'm in love with high notes; it's the tonal flow that matters to me.  What surprises me is that any conductor would go along with this common practice to accommodate the tenor.  Also consider that this was a highly publicized live production seen all over the world and destined for immortality on DVD.  Surely Ramon Vargas, a fine singer, could handle the higher tessitura for just one afternoon!<br /><br />Another gripe is the casting of two cameo roles, Benoit and Alcindoro, with the same bass, Paul Plishka.  Sure, this would be fine in any other production, but here, with close-ups galore, it just looks cheap.<br /><br />Angela Gheorghiu stills delivers all her trademark vocal goods, which are nicely suited to her vulnerable and believable Mimi, but alas, her age is starting to show and the camera is not always friendly.<br /><br />I was most impressed with Frenchman Ludivoc Tezier as Marcello.  Ironically, in this unmistakably Italian work, he offers an authentic Parisian flair with a deep portrayal of the beloved painter.<br /><br />All in all, these HD recordings are a treat, and I would not discount even this one.  When I watch it, I think \\"If only...\\"  So close, and yet so far.beloved painter.    All in all, these HD recordings are a treat, and I would not discount even this one.

B00006G8K0|5.0|This film marked a new beginning for vampire movies being in color and actually showing stakings.  Christopher Lee was savage and yet sexual in his approach to his victims, combining the suaveness of Bela with a beastial attitude.  \\"Dracula\\" as this film is known in the UK, was a great success for Hammer Films and led to six sequels.  The cast is well chosen and they play their roles to the hilt.  I believe this is the best Dracula movie ever made.  I highly recommend it to anyone.

B001GKJ2DO|5.0|Well, I am not a big fan of writing reviews, but with this one, I just have too...  Is funny when you consider yourself someone more like in the dark side of art, specially movies, and sometimes, there it comes, a movie like Mamma Mia which is so corny but overwhelms you with joy, music and dancing! and you just can't stop loving it...  why?  -the play is beautifull and the songs match perfectly with this simple but wondefull adventure, yes! I see mamma mia like an adventure movie, is a emotional adventure.  -ABBA, well, who can denay it... ABBA's music is just wonderfull, the catchy tunes, the wonderfull lyrics, there's something for everybody in Abba's songs.  -I was surprised how beautifull was to see the Island taking part of the movie experience though the beautifull colorfull shots of the water, white colored houses, trees and so on....  -I love the feelings of joy this movie brings to everybody, I was so proud of my best friend the first night we saw it at the movie theater, she took out a bottle of mineral water from her purse and tell me: \\"I brought some rum, handle me you coca cola light\\" it was a blast! we were six friends, and just saw the play in NYC 8 months ago... is nice to see people crying of joy. :)  -Meryl Streep and Amanda Seyfriend!!! Meryl, I saw you filming in Paris 4 months ago, you seem like just a joy to withhold. This movie was efertoless for you, you enjoy life like this! The number with Amanda seyfried \\"Slipping through my fingers\\" Amanda amazingly and beautifully fills the silver screen at the side of Meryl in this one, Hope to see more of you in movies to come.  -Aging is sexy!!!!!    and well, enjoy this movie with no Guilt! is wonderfull! :DDDDDDD
B0013FXWU6|5.0|This adaptation of OIL! by Upton Sinclair is so stunning that I'll forgive the author for his exclamation point.  158 minutes, and Sinclair's one of those respected writers we've all heard about without ever reading.  I am guilty.  And the movie weighs in at 158 minutes, so I expected boring but watchable.  Nope.  I was blown away.  Over already?  Damn.<br /><br />It makes me want to read the guy's work, and to learn more about the screenwriter responsible for such a powerful adaptation of the novel.<br /><br />Finally, I'd call this the greatest performance of Daniel Day-Lewis's career, and yes I have seen him in other movies.<br /><br />This movie, quite simply, does everything right.
B00168OINK|4.0|The trailer for this film made me think this would be a terrible movie, but it turned out pretty well, actually.<br /><br />Yes, the story is predictable and simple, as all children stories are, but it had some hilarious moments and the animation was second to none.<br /><br />Then why 4 stars? Because this movie could have been the very first Dreamworks movie to stand on its own without any pop-culture references, but... They couldn't help themselves and played \\"Kung Fu Fighting\\" at the beginning of the credits. Just a minor smear in an otherwise perfect movie... when the song is over, Chinese-style music begins, which better suits the movie. By the way, the Chinese characters during the credits are the actual characters for each of the animals.
B00004Z459|5.0|Nu-metal rules! Who needs those gay political bands like \\"Rage Against The Machine\\" when you've got incredible lyrics here? Bob Dylan? That guy is a joke, too. Linkin Park remains one of the finest bands I've ever listened to. The rapping is on-par with Lil' Wayne and the instrumentals are almost as good as those by Nickelback! This is a truly fantastic album. Listen to it now, you won't regret it!
B000YIGNKE|5.0|It seems a lot of JANE AUSTEN book readers buy the film adaptions, just to criticise them. Stop it. This adaption of PERSUASION is thoroughly entertaining. Only ninety minutes long, short enough to watch daily. It has a beginning, a middle and a happy ending. What more could you want?  It is as good as the BBC P & P, without having to wait for hours and hours to see what happens. Serious AUSTEN readers should not buy DVD's or go to the movies, they should stick to books. Anyone else will enjoy this version of PERSUASION. (probably)
B000021XS0|1.0|YAWN! I think the folks in Dream Theater need to stop trying so hard. They'll NEVER be as good as Slipknot or Staind. Just give up, guys! You suck. All of the songs sound the same. To write a Dream Theater song, it needs to have<br />1.) a 13:00+ running time<br />2.) 4/4 drumming<br />3.) inaudible bass<br />4.) whiny vocals (seriously, LaBrie can't sing for his life!)<br />5.) lame, three-chord guitar playing.<br />You guys suck, and so do your dorky fans! Everyone listen to St.Anger by Metallica if you want a real sense of metal.
1582701709|5.0|Good Read Slow in outcome More in the meat catagory.  Will see how things turn out. For those who believe!
B000002J09|1.0|I can't believe you people think this is good music. Led Zeppelin were just a bunch of druggies who made music to get with groupies. All of their songs sound exactly the same, too. Try some REAL rock, like Limp Bizkit. They created hard rock!
B000002U94|5.0|Nine tonight is so good it should be on DVD.It gives the raw power of an authentic band playing real live instruments with no fancy gimmicks,just plain simple,honest RnR,with a band who is at it's peak.Just listen to all the classics,played with fire and feeling.I've seen Bob and the Silver B band just once (livin' in Europe)and it was great.This album is a reminder of how it was.
B0000028M7|1.0|So I decided to listen to this album because I heard it was an amazing grunge album. Man! I was so disappointed. It was simply awful. Not one good song on it. All of the songs sound EXACTLY the same- seriously, folks. The guitar riffs are unimaginative and uninspired and that Lane Stailey guy is a horrible singer. He sounds like a whining puppy or something! Listen to real grunge like Staind or Daughtry. Alice In Chains are lame post-grunge.
B0002WYS6S|5.0|Dream Theater fan since 92 Images and Words Will be till the day I Die.  A band that can only be compared to one other in the world.  Led Zepplin of of the early nintys.  Take no prisoners style of writting music and no compromising the songs.
B00026WU82|1.0|Yawn! Why is this album in such high regard? It's crap. It's just a commercial computer manufactured pile of flaming poo. The guy can't even play guitar! He only knows how to play two chords. I think it's about time someone showed this hack to write music- Fred Durst, perhaps?
B000084T18|5.0|This guy is tha bomb! He gets a lot of MTV and BET airplay- meaning that he is more talented than those Beatles clowns. The lyrics are awesome and you can dance to the phat beats. He's so talented he doesn't even need to play an instrument! Beat that! He has amazing flow and is a true rap legend!
B00008LOS1|3.0|How many Original Recording Remastered editions do you need?? If you're going to released a \\"Deluxe Edition\\" then have it include an SACD disc!!!!!
B000RPTQ1C|1.0|Yawn! What a snoozefest of an album. Whoever likes this album is a total dork. And some of you have the nerve to give this 5 stars and call it a \\"masterpiece\\"! Yikes. I'd take good 'ol St.Anger or Staind over this \\"artistic\\" garbage.
B00168OINK|4.0|I bought it from Walmart yesterday as they are selling it a day in advance instead of the 9th.  I got the Blu Ray version and as a hidef fanatic, I am impressed with the picture and audio quality.  This is a must have for Blu Ray fans as the CG animation looks great.  The only thing that I didn't give it a full five stars is that it does not have a digital copy companion.  As far as the overall movie goes, I did like the story.  I watched it with the family and we all laugh at the funny scenes.  You get all these famous actors and actress doing the voice-over, combine it with awesome hidef CG quality and definitely your money is worth it.
B001E7OO2I|5.0|Im Sorry.. But I cant get enough of this ablum. I sing the songs in my sleep, at work, and in the shower. This is not normal type of album. This album is for people who seek different genres of music and tired of the norm. I'm So in Love with Almost all the songs. Esp Good Morning(Song & Intro), It's Over, Take Me Away, & This Time. If you only listened to the album once, how can you then, make a fair assessment? You must listen to the ablum several times. And when I say listen, I mean listen to the words. Understand the subject of the songs. Think deeper than the surface. I could just go on and on...
B000TGJ7ZY|2.0|First off, the extra star is for even attempting to make a vampire movie, which people don't do enough of.  That being said, I don't know how this ludicrous dud of a movie received 82% positive reviews on Rotten Tomatoes, but I can only surmise that free alcohol was provided at the advance screening.  Critics praised it as 'unique' and 'lavish', when what they really should have said was 'tactless' and 'gaudy'.  The costumes and sets are ridiculous, including a papal length robe for Dracula and hair that can only be described as a twin mohawk afro.  Keanau Reeves provides the final insult, delivering all his lines with what must be the first surfer dude inflected Southern English accent.  Anyone expecting a faithful, gothic style adaptation is in for nearly 3 hours of bitterness.  Unique indeed!
B0014I4KH6|5.0|TAYLORS MUSIC IS YOUNG AND WHOLESOME COUNTRY - SHE BRINGS A YOUTHFUL APPROCH TO COUNTRY AND EXEMPLIFYS A NEW ENERGY FOR COUNTRY - SHE IS THE ALL AMERICAN GIRL - KEEP UP THE GOOD WORK!
B001GAPC1K|1.0|This movie is perhaps the worst atrocity foisted upon the unsuspecting public by brain-dead and/or corrupt movie critics.  How else to explain it's 93% approval rating on Rotten Tomatoes?  Packed with airheaded one liners masquerading as meaningful dialogue, and one dimensional characters so narcissistically unlikable a Wal-Mart greeter wouldn't even acknowledge their presence, this clunker somehow goes through all the motions of a summertime action movie without being the least bit entertaining.  Oh and it has a deep moral message too: making weapons for a living is evil, because someday bad guys might use them!
0446579939|5.0|This was the first time I have ever bought anything off of Amazon.com and it was the best experience I could have had! I even put in the wrong billing address and was able to contact the seller to have them help! Also, the product did not even look used at all! I bought \\"The Lucky One\\" by Nicholas Sparks and it looks like I bought it off the self at a Barns and Noble!  Thank you so much!
B001EE35W6|2.0|Downloaded this into my laptop with good logitech speakers. Disappointing sound quality. Thin bass, at times very weak treble. Just a poorly recorded, or dubbed or whatever, production. Wish I could get my money back.
B000I5X80G|4.0|I was at this show, so I am thrilled to have this CD, and without any hesitation I also bought a copy for my friend with whom I went to the show, hitchhiking in from CT. This recording comprises selections from one of the most amazing nights of music I have ever experienced - and there have been many - with outstanding sets from the Steve Miller Band (then a new power trio), Miles Davis (a little out of place but an interesting juxtaposition, precisely what Bill Graham tried to achieve with such lineups), and Neil Young, in a transcendent moment, having recently established himself as a major artist.     This CD captures some of that transcendence, especially in \\"Cowgirl In The Sand,\\" but it could have been so much more. This is only about half the set, and key songs like \\"Cinnamon Girl\\" and \\"The Loner\\" have been omitted. Other reviewers mention these and other songs were left off because of the lower sound quality of their recording. I wish the producers of this album would not have been so fussy. I would rather have had a recording of the complete performance, warts and all. The vast majority of fans of live rock recordings are willing to forgive such inconsistencies in quality in order to have the complete performance. I wish the producers of this type of recording would understand this, after having seen and heard these pleas for decades.    That said, it's great to listen to this CD and hear what I heard so many years ago. Three of these songs, \\"Winterlong,\\" \\"Wonderin',\\" and \\"Come On Baby Let's Go Downtown,\\" are new to me (well, pretty much - it's been forty years) and are revelations. \\"Everybody Knows This Is Nowhere,\\" not really the best song from the album of the same name, is solidly performed here. \\"Down By the River\\" seems a little tentative compared to the album version, but \\"Cowgirls In The Sand\\" burns, and when they're done the band has nothing left. This album reminds me of the album \\"East-West Live\\" by The Paul Butterfield Blues Band, put out by their keyboardist Mark Naftalin a dozen years ago. That featured three different versions of that classic jam, which gave listeners an opportunity to experience part of the piece's evolution. It demystified the \\"original\\" version from the band's second album, but furthermore illuminated the piece. Whatever version of a performance of a musical composition is originally released enters the public consciousness and becomes known as the definitive version; \\"East-West Live\\" and similarly this version of \\"Cowgirls In The Sand\\" stand as reasonable alternates to the \\"definitive\\" version everybody knows. And everybody knows this is nowhere, though it's a great place to visit.
B0016Q2D5M|2.0|I just finished watching this film on a 42\\" lcd flat screen tv with a blu ray system in place. I bought it after hearing how good it was in 3D and figured that the technology would be the same. Wrong-O!  The first thing I noticed when I took the glasses out that they were the old colored 3D glasses and those never gave true 3D. As I watched the movie I found that some of the effects where hit or miss. Sometimes the 3D would seem to pop out a bit but most of the time the movie was like watching the old view master toys but the picture was moving. Also, like noted by some of the other reviews, the glasses distorted the picture. My wife wears contact lenses (gas premables or something like that.)and she commented that the picture seemed to jump into black or white for her. The manufactuers only suggestion is to watch the movie on a bright setting.  Overall the movie is some what enjoyable but the reviews about how great the 3D is in theaters should not be here. It is misleading. The technology in the movie theaters was polarized I've found out which gives the movie a far superior look. If you've ever experienced Disney at one of their theme parks you know what I mean.  I would avoid buying this movie until they remaster it to work with polarized 3D or some other technology that will give you a theater like experience the movie itself is not good enough to blow the money on unless you are a HUGE Brendan Fraser fan.
0307346617|4.0|For anyone who is starting to grow tired of the new Zombie cycle in culture, World War Z should safisfy as a departure from the usual.<br /><br />The fresh take is that unlike most zombie stories, WWZ goes far beyond the initial outbreak, and unlike Romero, the epidemic is viewed on a global scale, not just middle-America.<br /><br />This may be a detraction for those who want a more horror-centric, flesh feast.  But that card has been played out ad nauseum.  It takes far more ambition to attempt what Max Brooks has done.<br /><br />The only detractions I can pick at is the anecdotal style doesn't vary much, so many chapters have similar patterns.  Also, the characters met in the book have very similar speech patterns, and usually all talk in a rhetoric that fails to provide much room for character development.  Finally, a few scenarios feel a bit far fetched, such as one where an armed militia forms an assault line and literally walks across the US to clear out the undead.  Logistically, this would be one hell of an undertaking, and would probably take decades to accomplish with a fairly unorganized and resource starved society in a post-apocalypse.<br /><br />Minor gripes aside, this is a farily fresh take on the genre, who's real fear factor is not being eaten by a zombie, but surviving the collapse of our interdependent global state, and the many conflicts across the world in the present that could use the plague as a catalyst for all out war on their enemies.
B001GAOY5U|2.0|Only dvd/blue ray reviews should be here, November 8, 2008   By  Zendoch \\"Zendoch\\" (USA) - See all my reviews     I just finished watching this film on a 42\\" lcd flat screen tv with a blu ray system in place. I bought it after hearing how good it was in 3D and figured that the technology would be the same. Wrong-O!

I would avoid buying this movie until they remaster it to work with polarized 3D or some other technology that will give you a theater like experience the movie itself is not good enough to blow the money on unless you are a HUGE Brendan Fraser fan.      I'll add that to pay what one pays for blu-ray disc you should expect more from advanced technology than an upgrade in the color of your glasses. HD and blu-ray create beautiful pictures so unless you want a 3D experience that cheapens your set up I would, rent, skip or borrow a buddy's until they remaster this.
B000001FA4|4.0|Great disc, if you qre a huge fan of U2 you need to buy thi album right now. In my opinion this album shows the alternative side of U2.
0385340567|5.0|First of all let me clarify something.  There's clearly a campaign in Amazon against this book.  You have hundreds of dismal reviews based on one thing only:    Child messed with WAR PROFITEERING creeps!  and the usual fascist monkeys came out to oppose this book.  Pitiful.  Specially from the ones calling themselves Christians.    Anyway...  THE BOOK is classic REACHER stuff. Absolutely compeling and great for any Child fan. It keeps being creative and avoiding flat repetition in spite of being a formula genre. (If you are new to Reacher, try to start from the beggining, not necessary, but useful)  My admiration for this writer keeps growing... he is still on top of his game after many many years... only very few artists can do this.
0307383415|5.0|Now that Obama's election has brought worldwide euphoria and made him the world's most famous man, his memoir is bound to become a lightning rod for cynics and dreamers alike.  I suggest reading the book instead as an insight into the man he was becoming a dozen years ago.  And whatever he might be today -- overburdened by a world of hope he can't possibly satisfy, and overhyped by our hunger for anyone but our current president -- he has written a remarkable book.  Before we even knew his name, he was becoming Barack Obama, a sensitive, troubled searcher with an eloquent gift for crafting a story, collapsing time in narrative, and capturing a scene.  I read \\"Dreams From My Father\\" hoping to understand our next president.  I got far more out of it, coming to understand the duality of race in America, the struggles of sons and fathers, and the interconnectedness of cultures across oceans and centuries.  We'll doubtless be saturated in the coming months and years with Obama this Obama that.  That makes it all the more essential to read Obama before he became burdened by his own audacious hope.  Don't take my word for it, or any other reviewer's, whether they consider Obama a monster or a god.  Read about the man in the process of becoming a man.
B001ECQ75A|2.0|When I saw the previews of this movie, they were simply hilarious!<br /><br />Unfortunately, another case of the best parts of the movie being those parts in the previews, with the actual delivered product not living anywhere up to the hype.<br /><br />There were a few chuckles if you can wade through to the last 1/3 of the flick. Otherwise, forget it.

B000N4SHOE|4.0|Such a sweet little movie! If you grew up reading Beatrix Potter, you will know and love the characters in this movie. A little sweet, a little sad and a whole lot of cute!
B00006ADD5|1.0|I watched this movie because it's a classic and IMDB rates it #35 movie of all times.<br /><br />This comment comes from someone with a long attention span, who actually enjoys long movies where there is character development (Gone with the Wind, for example) or an intricate plot (The Usual Suspects); from someone who is not an action flick junkie but appreciates film for the underlying philosophy (Memento, The Machinist, Vanilla Sky, Dark City) and the dialogue (Before Sunrise); from someone who recognizes beautiful cinematography (Y Tu Mama Tambien, Anna and the King), innovative editing (Run Lola Run) or non-linear storytelling (Memento).<br /><br />In each of those aspects, Lawrence of Arabia plain sucked.<br /><br />The movie is so painful to watch that it took me 5 hours to go through it, with breaks to save my sanity. Yet had I left the movie running, I wouldn't have missed anything. The plot is nothing to write home about, and the only worthwhile piece of the stilted dialogue is when Lawrence challenges the Arab notion of predestination with his willpower: \\"I shall be in Aqaba. That IS written. [pointing to forehead] In here\\". There you've just had all that's worth watching in this most protracted piece of utterly useless celluloid. Indeed, the only other memorable thing about it is its length. If you want to see a portrayal of a character's determination, watch Cool Hand Luke. Heck, you have to be even more determined to watch Lawrence of A Labia in its entirety.<br /><br />Therefore, excuse the title of the review, but really, I challenge you to describe in clear, logical terms why Lawrence of Arabia has an 8.6 rating on IMDB and is #35 in the Top 250!<br /><br />In the meantime, I will completely and irrevocably cease to use IMDB's ranking as a source of movie recommendations.
B000W7JWUA|3.0|this game was really fun to play for a while, but it lost it's luster after a while. part of this I suppose is that I played with the same people most of the time. avoid playing with the same people over and over again, they will figure out your strategies and deny you resources you need. trading is a pain because no one wants to give up resources if they think you need them to win, this gets annoying sometimes.<br />again, it was fun for me for a few months, I enjoyed the game and it's level of strategy, but what kills it for me is that you basically HAVE to trade to win. I much prefer the[[ASIN:B00005UNAX Carcassonne Game]] because there is no trading involved.
B00125WAWS|5.0|Excellent movie, it is nice to get such a great story from our history.  The cast did a great job, and they were able to talk with some of the original people to get the feel of the era.<br /><br />We need more movies about little known stories in the growing of our nation.  This should be shown at all high schools.
B000KN7BIQ|1.0|I ordered a HD copy of The Sting on DVD.  The DVD would not load on my HD player.  I returned the defective DVD and was sent a second HD copy of The Sting on DVD.  The second DVD also would not load on my HD player.  I returned the second one for a refund.  I think you were sent a batch of defective HD DVD's.  I am still awaiting my refund of the original purchase price.
B000V78URW|5.0|I am not typically a reader. I had heard the author on the radio talk shows, along with numerous references to her doctrine by political pundits. When the economy began its recent decent, I decided it was time to read this book. I am not as eloquent as other reviews in my review. I was simply overwhelmed by the thoroughness of the research and information. The pages of footnotes say it all. This is not fluff piece. What alarmed me was how all this went on, right under the noses of both political parties and numerous administrations, and no one stopped it. Except for the people. It took the desire for people that want to live free and just that thwarted these evil people. This recent election of Obama will hopefully put a nail in the coffin of the Chicago School of Economics. I am now a book junkie, and have ordered 15 more books on politics. I have a lot of catching up to do.
B0014Z4OQG|3.0|this movie was okay. it wasn't scary as i hoped it was. and the way they made it, it made it even worse. the movie was okay. i wouldn't buy it.
B0001AVZA8|4.0|In a nutshell, this movie is about two accomplished yet lonely people who fall in love. Wow, good story and good acting....don't see that much anymore! It also has a nice soundtrack which really complements the tone. Jack is amazing as always, and Diane is perfectly annoying! Some great lines too. It's also fun with the dvd to freeze the scene where Diane is nude...I usually do that every halloween. She has a nice house though.
B001GAPC1K|5.0|I originally gave a 4 star review.  The missing star was because I was underwhelmed by the sound.  However, I found some suggestions to ensure DRC (Dynamic Range Compression) was turned off on both the PS3 and receiver.  I replayed a few scenes and the sound was great.  Turn off DRC to get the full effect!  (On the PS3 go to Settings-->Video Settings-->DRC and set to OFF).

B000066NW0|4.0|\\"Let Go\\" was quite a piece of work for a 17 year old kid. Don't know (or care) how Avril has amassed such a large group of \\"haters\\". As someone who was around when punk first came to be and was an active player on the Boston punk scene,  I'd remind all those ranting about \\"fake punk\\", etc, should keep in mind that Johnny Rotten & crew (and most other \\"real punks\\" of the era) were, JUST LIKE AVRIL, middle-class kids from the 'burbs who were largely \\"acting out\\". I can't attest to Ms. Lavigne's \\"sk8er\\" cred, but as a professional musician, I can attest to the high quality of the songwriting and musical performances on this cd. Did she get assitence from \\"The Matrix\\" crew? Undoubtedly - as did EVERY OTHER ACT they produced. Having seen her perform, I have to agree that she sometimes has trouble w/ pitch, her voice is a bit thin, & it appears her guitar playing skills are quite limited (although contrary to one mis-informed reviewer, there is indeed a G chord in \\"Complicated\\") - but many singer-songwriters can't do much more than strum chords. All I can say to all the \\"haters\\" out there is I'd love to hear what you could come up with at 17 years old - I've spent literally years in the studio, as both a \\"hired gun\\" and recording my own material, and I'd be ecstatic if the results were half as good as this album. Hell, if I could write just one song as good as \\"Complicated\\", I'd be a happy man. Any of you ranting about her inability to sing/write/play ever actually been in a studio? I thought not. Were any of you there in the studio when \\"Let Go\\" was recorded to verify the claims you make re: her not writing any of the material, etc? Again, I thought not.
0307346617|4.0|This book is a badge of honor to which I will proudly announce that I have read.  You would not be wasting your money if you purchased this book and were truly afraid for the future.  It's realistic, well written, and leaves enough for the imagination to let your mind spin with gruesome possibilities that would be present with legions of the shambling undead breaking in your front door to feed on your flesh...<br /><br />The only negative gouging I would offer for this book is that the ending was a little soft for my taste.  A personal opinion, but I, like so many others, actually thought Star Wars episode 1 was a good idea...before I actually saw it... (drastically reducing my credibility in reviewing this book) so don't take my critiques too seriously or you'll end up with a brain tumor and a serious distrust of politicians...<br /><br />Anyway, regardless, it's a good and solid read, A serious bit of fun that I would recommend getting your hands on, if nothing else but to hold up in front of your basement dwelling- dice throwing friends to say, 'HA! I'm prepared for the end of the world!  I Tarzan, you- Zombie meat!'
B000NA1OXY|4.0|I like this cd. Reminds me of Joan Jett's \\"Bad Reputation\\" - punky, bratty, fun, if perhaps a bit over-produced. Not crazy about the new band; I liked the younger guys better than these older \\"pros\\". To my ears, they gave her work a bit more energy; my only complaint on \\"Best Damn Thing\\" is that the music sounds somewhat forced, a bit too pristine. Not the greatest album ever, maybe not as good as her monumental first release, but a fun, enjoyable collection of well-crafted punky pop with strong hooks.
B001437DMA|5.0|I was skeptical about buying this CD after reading some of the negative reviews. I was blown away! This CD is awesome. Why the criticism? This is a solid CD from start to finish. I do not hear any filler. I had the chance to see him live a couple of weeks ago. Joe and his band put on a fantastic show. Keep up the great work guys!
B000002UAX|5.0|Aside from \\"Number Nine\\", there are no \\"clinkers\\" on this. To answer one reviewers question, yes, as a matter of fact, there were times in '68 that I personally DID wake up & \\"just have to listen to \\"Why Don't We Do It In The Road\\"\\" (just as there were times I just had to listen to \\"Jigsaw Puzzle\\").  Like another reviewer, I also got the White Album for Christmas '68. Is this album the greatest of The Beatles releases? A silly question, if you ask me. To my ears, that would be \\"Revolver\\", & Sgt. Pepper would be third or fourth on the list. That said, I realize that it's a VERY subjective question with no \\"right\\" answer. If you're looking for the most eclectic album, one that displays the widest range of the combined songwriting skills of the Fab Four, I'd say this is the obvious choice. Is every song a \\"masterpiece\\"? Hardly, but on the other hand, I wouldn't judge any of the songs, save the aforementioned (and very experimental) \\"Number Nine\\", to be \\"clinkers\\". It's as fine piece of work as any produced in the '60's, and better than most. Certainly on a par with \\"Beggers Banquet\\", which I also judge as one of the best of the '60s.
B00129H7VS|5.0|Truly the best WWII series ever.  The Blu Ray quality is absolutely amazing.  This truly defines why they call it the greatest generation.  They truly are.  Dick Winters is truly an amazing man and worth the Medal of Honor upgrade his men are trying to get for him.   Absolutely the best Blu ray in my collection.   If you have teenagers they should watch this so they understand the value of the freedom we have.  For the technical aspects:  The audio is awseome with DTS Master Audio and 24fps video.  No DNR or EE evident anywhere with perfect resolution and film grain as intended. This is an absolute 10!!
0671027573|2.0|I am so disapointed in this book and, i'm a huge Linda Howard fan. I did not like this group of characters including Jaine and Sam. Those to went so fast to hating eachother to wanting to get married and, i just didn't feel the love between them. I did however like the twist with the killer and the setting in a area i grew up in lol. Pass Mr.Perfect and choose another Howard great cause i know she has plenty to choose from.
0007270968|4.0|I enjoyed this book quite a bit, it was a quick read, with just a few pages that I skimmed over because they were sort of irrelevant (the listing out of soccer matches got boring quickly).<br /><br />I definitely felt for Gordon when reading about his incredibly crappy childhood and adolescence. I giggled when I read about him shagging a restaurant owner's wife when he was 19.<br /><br />He definitely has had an interesting life. I think this book puts a more human face on his persona.<br /><br />He comes out as a likeable, driven, and ambitious professional. Just two small gripes - he's so gung-ho about not spoiling his children that he goes IMO overboard. As a parent myself, I don't think that kids who get more than 1 Christmas gift each will grow up spoiled. For some reason, Gordon seems to think that giving them 1 pound allowance and just 1 present each will ensure that they grow up selfless and appreciative.<br /><br />Another thing that bugged me a bit was his insistance that in the restaurant kitchen, the staff is not allowed to laugh or wear their name embroidered on their chef's whites.<br /><br />Gordon - no matter how serious you think your job is, it's just cooking. You're not curing cancer.<br /><br />P.S. At first I thought \\"His wife must be a saint to put up with him\\" but then I realized that he's never home anyway! She probably lets him feel like the boss when he IS at home, and the remaining time, she just runs things the way she sees fit and he's none the wiser.
0800141660|5.0|This is one of my favorite films. I must have watched it a dozen times, and own the DVD.     The script and production are exceptional. You will feel you are in Regency England, the sets, costumes, and landscape -- every detail of the production is gorgeous. The score is also wonderful, and Ang Lee's direction is, well, I'm running out of superlatives. Let's just say every scene is beautiful, and the direction, scoring, script, photography -- all are done beautifully to convey a sense of underlying silence, a quieter more thoughtful time than our own, with a gentler pace.     The casting is brilliant. Kate Winslet is the perfect Marianne Dashwood, and gives a marvelous performance. As does Alan Rickman as Colonel Brandon, and all the rest of the cast.     My only complaints are that Emma Thompson and Hugh Grant were miscast, and their acting was many notches below that of the rest of the cast.     Thompson, 36 at the time of this release, is far too old for the part of Elinor, 19. She is not believable as someone of marriagable age in that era. And Hugh Grant is miserably miscast as Edward. His youthfulness further accentuates Thompson's age.     They are not believable in the roles, and their performances are also not up to snuff. When they're on screen, I'm aware of acting and actors, not the characters and story. It's a glaring error, enough to be jarring each time I watch the film. This is a shame, because Thompson's amazing script, the casting, production, directing, and the rest of the cast make this film is a work of art in all other respects.     Even so, this film is a favorite and a wonderful treat each time I see it. I love it enough to give it 5 stars. It never gets old.
031606792X|2.0|After all the hype for this book, it reallyfailed to live up to expectations. I gave the first three books to my mom, and she liked them. Then I gave her this and she had to put it down in the middle. Bella is so helpless, even as a vampire. In the first books, she was helpless, but in a kind of lovable way. When she became a vampire, she lost all of her personality, and everything that made her who she is! There was no character growth in this book. The two climaxes were where she had the baby and when the Volturi attacked, both of which turned out fine, by the way. As morbid as it may seem, I think that the book would have been better if someone important died. And what was with all of the extra vampires, they weren't even important in the end. When I was done with the book, I realized that for the last 150 pages, Stephanie Meyer had tried to drag out the book by hanging onto the weak plot by her fingernails. The ending was very dissapointing also and really failed to wrap up this formerly really great saga.

B001CQONKY|2.0|Watched every season every episode so far, Season 8 is hopeless, some episodes are boring and to me were just fillers, You Kill Me in particular, what was that all about, even the first couple of episodes were sparse and self indulgent, as I watched episode after episode I was waiting for that CSI winning formula of old, the only saving grace was the poison dwarf = the short young girl with the big IQ.  Has CSI ran its course can there only be so many stories about Las Vegas, there was even one episode that intertwined with Without a Trace that was disjointed.  Grissom was god and this CSI was the best series, not sure now as CSI Miami seems to me to more watchable.  The characters are worn out and boring, only Jim Brass is ever good, Sara you wont be missed.
0143038419|5.0|I am surprised by some of the negative comments about this book.  It is about a woman's search for herself ... so of course this would be about HER!  Through her self discovery she has made a difference in women who are on a similar journey.  I being one of them.  Gilbert's writing is making a lighthearted read of a very dark time in her life.  I did not suffer from the same kind of depression as Gilbert did, but due to a difficult marriage and divorce I am on my own self discovery and search for spirituality during a very hard time.  I appreciated Gilbert's candid honesty, her willingness to admit her own shortcomings and her humor.
B001CISHU4|5.0|I'm fairly new to Amon Amarth and not a particularly big fan of death metal (or whichever genre they are supposedly playing), but I must admit that this album absolutely blew me away. It is right up my musical alley, as it were. The guitars are distorted in a way that reminds me of the metal of my youth 10-15 years ago, rough and tough. Not the overly distorted, too deep 'nu-metal sound' many bands seem to favour these days. The drumming is solid, with good double bass drums, and the vocals are really good. They fit the music and never become softly sung choruses, yet the lyrics are easily understood. A rare, but very welcome, mix.    This brings me on to the composition of the music. It's fast and furious, yet very melodic and creative. Nice tempo changes and very fitting solos. This is old school metal played in a modern way. Very nice. The riffs are catchy and I often find myself humming them when I wait for the lift or some such. A fate, that, up until now, only was suffered by some of Beethovens 'riffs'.    In conclusion I'd say, that this is one of the best albums of indeed any genre I've purchased for quite some time. I'm already looking forward to their next effort. Highest possible recommendation.
0553062182|5.0|I dare say I enrolled in Psychology in college to try and discover what made me so different.  Now 17 years out of college, I have finally figured it out!  Hallelujah!  This author's theory explains EVERYTHING about my oddities.  I feel less alone.  Now I need the Cliffs Notes version so my spouse can get filled in without having to read the whole book.<br /><br />What's it like to be Highly Sensitive? I can't schedule more than one or two meetings or appointments on any given day or I will feel overwhelmed. I need hours of alone time to recharge. I'm always worried people don't like me. I avoid crowds whenever possible. I run to close the window when I hear power mowers in the neighbors' yards - the sound drives me batty.  The volume on the TV can't be too high or I will become tense and agitated. Smokers and people with heavy perfume annoy me.  I'm the quintessential picky eater.  I have to wash my feet before bed every night - I can't go to sleep if my feet are dirty.  I have spectacularly vivid dreams and nightmares. I am a morning person. I worry about little things.  I worry about big things.  People tell me I am the calmest person they know. I don't appear to be neurotic, however, as people tell me I am friendly, outgoing and social.  What a public face!  Now I can understand that my nervous system is wired a little different than most.<br /><br />This book is a real eye opener.  I wish I had discovered it when it was originally published!

1575666286|4.0|After reading some of the book, I ordered literature from the organization. I do not recommend ordering most articles as they are testimonials and self-promotional literature w/ little substance, unless someone needs inspirational documentation of the natural approach to healing.  Out of the expensive charges for 3 documents, only one was helpful with actual research information. As for the book, I do recommend it as it offers a positive alternative to conventional medicine that does not offer the cure rate that the Gerson Therapy offers. The therapy has a greater success rate and long-term survival rate than conventional medicine.  But if one chooses to go this route to healing and survival, it is expensive; if you determine to use home therapy, realize that the local markets may not offer the recommended organics to support a full regimen the book dictates. The therapy has been labeled quackery by the medical profession. However, after researching the multiple approaches to disease management, control, and eradication,   the author's approach seems to be more legitimate. Should all conventional medicine be shunned? The answer is left up to the individual. A high potasssium diet can lead to other illnesses beside the one illness a person is treating.  But this approach cannot be ignored or called \\"quackery\\". It is an alternative that has worked for over 60 years. The TRUTH in natural healing appproaches is in the middle between conventional and natural. Book highly recommended. The therapy takes us away from the modern assumptions that we are NOT what we eat. We are what we eat..

0786891181|5.0|P.S. I Love You by Cecelia Ahern    I read this book and I thought it was a good book to read.  This is very detail, exciting, and loving story.  I recommend this book to people of all ages who likes to read love stories.  This book has almost everything a reader could want.  I always wanted to know what was going to happen next in the story.  Cecelia Ahern, the author of this book, wrote the story with a lot of detail that I could picture myself in the story as I read it.  The book had happy moments and sad moments.  Sometimes after reading the book I was sad and other times I would laugh because they were some very funny parts.  \\"P.S. I Love You\\" was sad because one of the characters, Holly, loses her husband Gerry to a brain tumor.  He dies at age thirty, but he left Holly a package of letters.  After Gerry was gone Holly could feel his presence still with her.  She would read the letters and she felt Gerry was at her side.  I think Holly was brave because it was so difficult to recover from her husband's death.  It was a \\"true love\\" novel.  The message in the book for me was to start over when a loved one goes away and not be afraid of whom I am.  I really enjoyed reading the book because when you start reading it, you don't want to stop.  It catches your attention.  I really recommend this book because it is very interesting and enjoyable to read.
B00192KCQ0|4.0|Life is just full of surprises.  Right when everyone thought Metallica was finally down for the count, they make a startling comeback.  A brief history for the somehow uninitiated: It began in '91 with the Black Album, which while good, was missing something from their classic thrash days.  Then there was \\"Load\\" and \\"Reload\\", which was a huge and risky departure in sound (personally, I enjoyed a lot of songs from those albums, but there were plenty of duds in there as well). Then there was \\"St. Anger\\", which I can only describe as the absolute nadir of their career.  A perhaps well-meaning attempt to recapture their youth, it came off more as one giant midlife crisis.<br /><br />This brings us to 2008, and the release of \\"Death Magnetic\\".  This sounds to me like perhaps what they were going for with \\"St. Anger\\", but here it actually worked.  While not quite a vintage thrash metal album, they have still managed to bring back a large portion of their classic signature sound, and the end result comes off very much like a more modern version of \\"And Justice for All\\".  In fact, this sounds like a direction they might have gone in 17 years ago, rather than the Black Album.  It almost feels like the last four albums never happened, and they're just picking up right where \\"Justice\\" left off.<br /><br />This is an epic album, filled with long complex compositions, and plenty of killer riffs and solos.  It's much more dynamic than any of the past four albums, and it rocks harder as well.  Songs like \\"Cyanide\\", \\"All Nightmare Long\\", and the almost Slayer-esque \\"My Apocalypse\\" capture the band's oldschool spirit like they haven't done in years.  \\"The Day That Never Comes\\" is a killer epic ballad in the vein of \\"One\\" or \\"Sanitarium\\", and is a definite highlight for me (when I first heard it, it reminded me of when I heard \\"One\\" for the first time, and couldn't stop listening to it for quite a while).  \\"The Unforgiven III\\" is a worthy installment to the series, despite sharing no musical or lyrical themes with the first two.  It's considerably slower and moodier than the rest of the album, but makes for nice diversity.  Nice piano intro too.<br /><br />Perhaps the best of the bunch though is the absolutely stellar instrumental, \\"Suicide & Redemption\\".  This is right up there with their classic instrumentals, and one of the best songs of their entire career.  I still can't believe it's nearly 10 minutes long, because it sure does go by fast.<br /><br />Of course, for all the superlatives this album deserves, it's not perfect.  The production quality is sort of weak, and the heaviness of the album isn't always brought out as well as it should be (I'll bet this material is WAY better live).  Also, Lars's drumming, while greatly improved from \\"St. Anger\\", is still not what it used to be.  James Hetfield's vocals are still showing their age, but he sounds exponentially more energized and more importantly more comfortable than he has in a while.  Some of the lyrics are kind of cheesy, but nothing like the \\"what the hell were they thinking\\" kind of stuff they did with \\"St. Anger\\".<br /><br />For the most part, there's really not much to complain about here.  This album isn't \\"Master of Puppets\\" by a longshot, but it's way better than I expected to hear from them at this point in their career.  If nothing else, it's a definite step up.<br /><br />Now come back to Austin and play this stuff live. :)cal themes with the first two.

B001DTPZNY|1.0|This movie, although I thought it was decently put together was nothing more than a historical disaster and a complete \\"slap in the face\\" to the people of Peru and of Central America.  The first 3 Indy movies had a lot more truth to them, as far as the regions they were shot in and said to be taking palce than the \\"Crystal Sull\\".  The myth of the Crystal Skulls is 100% in the Mayan culture of Central America, and in NO WAY made its way to the Inca who controlled the entire area of Peru, Chile, Equador and parts of Colombia...You do NOT go to Cuzco to get to Nazca...why would you go to a city that is 10,000 ft in the Andian Mountains to go to an area that is 4 hours south of lima, in the desert?  The places they went, the things they claimed were part of the \\"Crystal Skills\\" was nothing but pure stupidity.      For those who say a lot of the other Indy movies are far fetched...the Temple of Doom: there is evidence that native tribes of Peru did much of that was done in that movie... controlled people with the use of drugs, tearing peoples hearts out to appeal to the gods...things like that happened (although not with the bare hand).  This movie would have been MUCH better if they would have had SOME historical fact to it, other than the Crystal Skull themself.  They have been found, there are no \\"tool markings\\" on them and they are exact in every way to a human skull.  Key work phrase \\"humen skull\\", NOT an alien.      I just do not see how people can watch this movie, think it is an equal to the last 3 and think that a movie has no right to uphold some historical value and in the least should show respect to the cultures of the people of the country they film in.  I have many friends in Peru, and they all, as well and their friends are VERY angry about the way this movie was done and the things it claimed.
B001ED7C58|3.0|I devoured the four Twilight books and grabbed the soundtrack the day it came out in anticipation of the upcoming movie. I found the collection of rock tracks to be a lot darker and angsty than I was hoping for. Good songs, but just harder and angrier. Yes, its a vampire movie and there is action, but I also expected there to be softer pieces more along the lines of Rob Pattinson's song. This is a love story before anything else. I didn't get that feeling at all from the CD. The more I listen, the more I like the music, but I think I'll have to see how its used in the movie before I can make a final judgement.    I do have to agree with other reviewers that the biggest disappointment was Bella's Lullaby. This superorchestrated piece of music is beautiful but nothing like its described in the book. The version of \\"A River Flows in You\\" by Yiruma that has been circulating on the web is a beautiful and much more appropriate song that I wish could've been included instead.    I'm hoping the original score released in December will have the moody instrumental music I'm looking for.    (UPDATE: I have seen the movie and I think the music works, surprisingly. The songs have also grown on me quite a bit, so I'd add a star to my review if I could figure out how.)

B0016Q2D5M|3.0|Mildly entertaining rendition of the Journey to the Center of the Earth - which is not a remake of the original Jules Verne novel - this one has a new story with an original twist.    I love Branden Fraser - loved him in The Mummy! Here is portrays a rather wimpy college professor trying to prove a theory about the fact that Jules Verne Journey to the Center of the Earth novel is not just fiction - but it actually there is such a place.    His nephew is played by Josh Hutcherson (Bridge to Terabihia) - typical 13 year old that hates the fact that he has to spend 2 weeks out of his summer vacation with his uncle.  When an anomaly in his computer lab detects another active volcano that might lead to Earth's core - he takes his nephew to Iceland to meet with another professor that had the same belief in Verne's theories.      When they arrive in Iceland they are greeted by the professor's daughter (Anita Briem) who is a mountain guide but staunchly doesn't believe in her father's writings.  She then agrees to take them up the mountain for an exorbitant fee.    I felt that much of the movie were clips from other films...  i.e. Scenes from Jurassic Park with extinct creatures, complete with the T-Rex; the roller coaster mine scene from Indiana Jones - Temple of Doom.  The acting was rather stilted and the scenes trite at times. The action adventure pace was good though as well as the special effects.  Still, it was enjoyable - didn't see it in 3-D but don't think it would have been that much of a difference!

1416562605|5.0|Aravind Adiga's The White Tiger is a terrific novel with a terrific story.  Balram Halwai, the complicated narrator, recounts his life story, telling the reader of his rise from poverty and all of the horrors he has lived through, the murder he had to commit.  This novel is witty and sharp while at the same time it is heartbreaking and sad.  Adiga is a clever writer, sharing much of the sufferings of the Indian people without ever preaching.  Balram is a pragmatic narrator who tells it as he sees it, with no sentimentality, even when recounting his own mother's funeral.  Enjoy.

B00005JPO1|4.0|The trio Ford Spielberg and Lucas sure know how to make a good movie! The humor and action are still there. The most important thing is that they have taken into account Ford`s age in the most funny way.     The other actors are very good. They support the plot very strongly. There are some familiar faces that are back in action.    The ending was not what I had hoped for. It was too Sci-Fi. But other than that it was a good movie.

0312427999|5.0|What a fantastically researched book.  It is full of details that you had no idea upon.  The foundation is set in great detail with the first application of Shock Therapy upon humans.  Then it talks about Milton Friedman's free market approach and its adoption through out the world.<br /><br />If these things are indeed true, the US has done crimes against Humanity.  For example, according to the book, the CIA supplied a list of 5000 names of liberals and union leaders to Pinochet's military in Chile so they can have them all killed.  All for the sake of money.  Who's making the money, not you or I.<br /><br />The middle of the book got a little tedious, it was the same thing over and over again.  How the US basically screwed over country after country with the free market approach.<br /><br />But the last section will get your blood boiling.  The last few chapters detail how the Bush administration and all his cronies became immensely rich, by filling the public with lies to essentially fill their own pockets and the pockets of their friends.  They surreptitiously gave themselves more power.  I'm afraid of the future.<br /><br />Why do most people, in this day and age, still vote republican and are still enamored by the fallacies of the complete free market approach I don't know.  Why do most poor people vote against their own best interest, I don't know.  But these are the people that need to read this book.<br /><br />It probably won't make a bit of difference though.  These are the same people that will read it and brush it off as fake or not true.  But even if the information in this book is 1% true, isn't that enough to change your minds about what the US has done to the world, our current role in the global politics and economy, and the falsity of complete free market capitalism.<br /><br />It's because we never had complete free market capitalism that we even have the little good things we have today.  Be thankful for that, and hope for a proper change for our children.<br /><br />Just look around you.

B00005JLCI|4.0|Branagh's  Hamlet<br /><br />  Watching Kenneth Branagh's massive film of the complete text of Hamlet for about the fourth time, I realized that this film mirrors the talents and career of its talented actor/director.  Ever since his highly successful film of Henry V, which ably competes with the classic version of Olivier, it seems that Branagh has been trying to film another great Shakespeare movie, but has not quite been able to repeat his early triumph.  His long Hamlet has not been able to change that pattern. His use of certain unsuitable actors,  his lack of real passion, and his inability to always keep things moving have made this a merely enjoyable movie rather than a great one.<br />  I don't say that American actors can't do Shakespeare. There have been some great American actors, such as Orson Wells, who have done magnificent Shakespeare films, such as Wells' Othello, but most American can't do the great Englishman very well (or at least not as well as Wells). However,  Kenneth Branagh seems to agree with Al Pachino, whose Looking for Richard starts off intending to show that Americans can do the Bard as well as any. Unfortunately, Pachino  falls far short of proving his claim, and  Branagh has used American actors with varying degrees of success in his Shakespeare films since Henry V, but it is in his Hamlet that his Anglo-American spirit of production shows its biggest failure, since the stakes here are the highest.  I'm sure the main reason that American film actors are used here along with British stage and film actors is to broaden the appeal, but it doesn't always work.<br />  The use of the wonderful American film actor Jack Lemmon is a good place to start, since he has some of the first words in the movie.  It's not that he doesn't know what he's saying, which seems to be the case with many American film stars who try Shakespeare, but he just can't keep up with the flow of the language to make it sound natural.  His British colleagues simply runrings around him, the poor old fellow, and this is part of the problem--he's just too old for this part of a soldier on watch outside at night in the cold.  Any one of the Brits could have successfully taken the part, and it's not a very minor one; in the role of Marcellus, he enters with Horatio and presents Horatio's skeptical nature, while speaking to the other two soldiers who have also both seen the ghost, \\"this dreaded sight twice seen of us.\\" Even though Lemmon tries manfully, he can't summon the same passion as Ian McElhinney as Barnardo. But, this is perhaps no great matter. Much worse is the presence of Gerard Depardieu as the spy Reynaldo.  He completely misses the humor in his part--in fact, he misses nearly everything in his part, and so does the audience, wondering what he's doing there.  He's there for the same reason as all the \\"name\\" stars are here: because they are draws, while Shakespeare is not, at least for the large targeted American audience. I don't know if Branagh had these stars thrust upon him, but he must take responsibility as director.<br /><br />  Some of the Americans do work well, such as a surprisingly good Robin Williams as Osric, and Billy Crystal as the grave digger,  though  Mork is the better of the two.  Charlton Heston is also good as the Player King, though he's a bit too leaden.<br /><br />  Some of the best acting is done by Derek Jacobi, as King Claudius, and Richard Briers as Polonius; no old fool, he plays the part of Claudius's spymaster with reserve and cunning.  Kate Winslet as Ophelia also comes in for special praise for her mad passion over the murder of her father by her lover.  She also shows control, and doesn't tear it to tatters, either.  Hers is real madness, and comes close to being frightening.  Also good are Michael Maloney as Ophelia's brother Laertes, who plays with a fine ferocity, and Rufus Sewell as Fortinbras, Hamlet's foil, who plays with a subdued fire, waiting for his chance.<br /><br />  And howis Branagh's  Hamlet?  Good, but not great.  Cool and reserved, a rational Dane, not a Romantic.  Perhaps he's closer to Horatio's materialism than we thought?  But, he does say there are more things than science (Aristotle's \\"Natural Philosophy\\") in heaven and earth.  My favorite Hamlets are Olivier, Jacobi , and Burton. They all have more depth and sheer excitement than Branagh can bring to the part, though there are ingenious touches in Branagh's direction, such as his use of the mirrors in \\"To be, or not.\\"<br />  Perhaps the biggest problem with this movie is its sheer length. Since it attempts to present the complete play with no cuts, it runs the risk of bogging down  in the fens, especially by the middle of the fourth act, when young Fortinbras goes through Denmark towards Poland over \\"an eggshell.\\"  Since this is a movie, and not a film of a staged performance, Branagh's Hamlet had the chance to move along briskly, but it slows down so much of the time that it all loses its impetus and force, as Hamlet himself is in danger of doing.  Branagh the director should have heeded the ghost, who returns in Act 3 to tell Hamlet to push things along.  By the end of this long tale, we wish we never heard about the ghost to begin with, and care no more about what happens to Hamlet or any of the others than about Hecuba, though, of course, we should.  The director, and not the king's to blame for this, since ambition falls short of achievement. Perhaps it was just too much to take on the dual roles of actor and director, but Branagh is competing with the ghost of Olivier, as he did with Henry V.<br /><br />  The best Hamlets on film remain Olivier's on Criterion, Jacobi's on BBC, and Burton's on Image.  Branagh's is a very valuable addition to this short list for many reasons, though it doesn't quite enter the list of the very best.  I also like the movie with Mad Max Mel Gibson and with the direction of Franco Zefferelli with its beautiful cinematography and its use oftwo lovely Scottish castles for Elsinore. Not in the same company as the others, but lots of fun.<br /><br />  P.S.  I must now add the excellent David Tennant perfomrmace with Patrick Stuart repeating his role of Claudius. One of the best!!!
B001EN71CW|5.0|At first Firefly was a bittersweet experience for me that ended with much love for the show. You see I was a fan of Dark Angel and Fox in their infinite wisdom replaced my favorite sci-fi television show at the time for this \\"Firefly\\" thing. I'm still a sci-fi fan so I watched Firefly. By the end of that premier episode (which ironically wasn't the first episode... more of Fox's infinite wisdom) I realize I'm looking at an innovative and well presented program.     Firefly is a beautiful blend of old west and outer space. Sounds strange, right? Well take it from me. The concept works. It works better than it might sound outright. The reason it works is because of two things: The backdrop universe they created and the well-written stories in front of it. The back-story is rich with history and this show takes a life of its own because of it. When the program is over you really get the feel that these people in this futuristic/western society is going. Kudos to Joss for sticking strong with that continuity.     The writing for this show is nothing short of excellent and reaches the level of gifted more than once. I think what really makes the show fresh is that you can never really know what the characters will do next. You know their disposition and who they are, but just about every episode has some scene where someone does something unexpected yet still in character. After seeing tons of shows where people's actions are so predictable you wonder why you bother watching Firely gives you that extra effort.     This is not a family show in case some of you are thinking Firefly is Star Wars-esque. Every episode has elements of violence and sexual situations at one level or another. At the same time the complicated moral delimas the characters deal with can be considered a good thing for a thinking teen to watch. While Firefly isn't a \\"parents strongly cautioned\\" kind of show I would assume it a PG-13 (TV-14, whatever) if you are screening for your kids.     This Blu-Ray release of the show promises to give you full 1080p/AVC MPEG-4 video and an English DTS-HD Lossless Master Audio 5.1 Surround sound. You get three disks instead of the four in the DVD release, and I think the packaging will be at least 50% slimmer. You get the exact same features as on the DVD release with just two new features no previously released. One is the featurette \\"Firefly Reunion\\" (in HD) which is pretty much was it sounds like. A lunch discussion with Joss, Nathan Fillion, Alan Tudyk and Ron glass. The other extra is a commentary track  for the episode \\"Our Mrs. Reynolds\\" with Whedon and actors Fillion, Alan and Ron (maybe Jewel Staite as well). None of the other extras will be in HD, but that's life.     If you are a sci-fi fan and missed this show you REALLY need to check this out. It's top notch storytelling with top notch effects, sets and acting. Fox has never been good with their sci-fi shows. This release trumps the original DVD release, although at a pretty hefty price tag. The video on the original DVD was excellent for standard definition. It's up you if the higher fidelity is worth the double dip if you already have the original. If you have neither it's still a toss up considering these days you can get the DVD version for a fraction of the Blu-Ray retail price. What will I do? Wait until prices fall.
B00192KCQ0|5.0|As a long time Metallica fan I've been waiting for the guys to put out this type of album again. Strong guitar play with great hooks.  St. Anger was so-so and the black album, load, reload each had some really good tracks but also some weak ones.  This is the first album since Justice that I can listen all the way through, doesn't let up.  Recommended.
B001KOFH2G|5.0|I watched Firefly when it was on TV and own the DVD set so I was excited about the movie and had high expectations. Those expectations were met, even if they werent exceeded. I want to make this review for people who are not familiar with the show. It helps if you're a science fiction fan, but it's not required. Essentially Serenity is a space opera that blends the setting of the old west with the far future. Sounds like a gimmick? Well it isn't. Why isn't it? Because it's done right.     The way the story blends the various elements make it believable that there are some well established planets that are futuristic are \\"Star Trek\\"-like and there are other planets that have hardly been colonized, thus more like frontier land. This is where our heroes come from. It's easier to understand and get that feel if you have seen the TV series, but you get enough exposition to keep the new viewers from looking at the movie cross-eyed.     The script is, of course, solid. Joss Whedon is known throughout the entertainment industry as being a very good writer. He alone turned a silly B-movie (Buffy the Vampire Slayer) into one of the best-written series on television. Joss' script for Serenity is no exception. You get a good mix of plot twists, comical moments, and drama peppered throughout a story that starts off simple then opens up pretty big. The only negative I will give on the writing is the movie has the pacing and feel of a television show. It reminds me of the same feel I got from Star Trek: Insurrection. It's not necessarily a bad thing. It's just an approach to the movie that's different than what I'm used to from a feature film. Don't let that keep you from seeing Serenity. If it's like a TV show, it's like the best TV show you will ever see on the big screen.     While this movie only had a budget about $40 million you wouldn't know by looking at it. They put that money on some fantastic special effects. The scenes in space are beautiful to behold, both the calm ones and the massively large ship battles. By the way I think Serenity does a better job with the big space battle than Star Wars Ep3 (same crazy action, but nowhere near as distracting). I think what helped on the budget was many of the sets were already built from the television show. Still the audio and added effects do stand out in a very good way. The acting is so solid you will find yourself liking more than one character in the movie. The music is a nice blend of that space opera soundtrack and old west.     There are some additional features on the Blu-Ray release that aren't on the previous DVD and HD-DVD releases. Here is a list of all of the features (* denotes a feature exclusive to the Blu-Ray):     * Alliance Database - Includes dossiers on all of the Firefly crew, profiles on planets, various historical entries, vehicle references and details on the reavers.     * U Control - This is broken down into four sections: Mr. Universe Compendium, Digital Tour of Serenity, Picture in Picture and Visual Commentary. It appears these are all interactive features instead of simple menu items.     * BD Live: My Scenes Sharing - It's part of the new BD Live set of features and is supposed to let you share your favorite scenes of the movie with your friends.     Feature Commentery with Writer and Director Joss Whedon - I am guessing this is the original commentary. If it is he gives a lot of director-type information like lighting and what camera lenses they used, but mentions nothing in lines of background info on the story. Joss also self-depreciates himself a lot on the commentary. First its entertaining that he can crack wise on himself, but it eventually gets old.     Feature Commentary with Joss Whedon & Cast Members Nathan Fillion, Adam Baldwin, Summer Glau and Ron Glass - Again not sure if this is the same as on the DVD version. They did a lot of cutting up in that one. Fun to listen to for a while.     Deleted Scenes with Optional Commentary by Director Joss Whedon - some of these scenes are nice and some are so-so. The good ones are so good I really hope Joss decides to do a director's cut DVD and put some of those scenes back in.     Future History: The Story of Earth That Was - Interview with Joss Whedon on how he got Firefly off the ground and so forth.     What's In A Firefly - Essentially a featurette on the special effects of the movie.     Re-Lighting The Firefly - Little documentary on the canceling of Firefly and how it came back to life in the form of this movie. Almost a tear-jerker for fans who experienced it firsthand.     A Filmmaker's Journey - A more in-depth documentary on the creating the movie. Includes some nice details on the actor's and how well they work together.     We'll Have A Fruity Oaty Good Time! - Mini-doc on the creation of the crazy commercial that River went nuts after watching. Comes with the complete commercial.     Extended Scenes - Four scenes in the movie in their extended glory. don't expect anything massive. These extended scenes aren't longer by much. I have no idea why Joss doesn't just put these in the disk and call the movie the extended edition. Oh well...     Take A Walk On Serenity - A snarky tour of the set with the director and actors.     The Green Clan - Documentary on Jeff Green the cinematographer.     Session 416 - All five web videos on River's final sessions at the academy they released prior to the movie.     On top of all that you get 2.35:1 1080p video and lossless 5.1 DTS-HD Master Audio. That in of itself is worth the double dip for current Serenity owners. The one thing I don't have info on is whether or not the Blu-Ray release will also have the outtakes. No bid deal as they weren't all that funny and was just the actors goofing up their lines and cursing about it. These documentaries are a mixed bag for me. Having seen the documentaries in the Firefly DVD I can tell these are lacking somewhat. They are still good documentaries. Just not as good as on the TV DVD set.
B00005JPO1|3.0|Its just not in the same league as the other films, including Temple of Doom.
B001GAPC1K|5.0|Great movie.  Special features are cool.  The Blu-Ray makes it all that much better.
0393327345|5.0|Here's a word to describe the pervasive resonance this story has enjoyed.<br /><br />Confrontational.<br /><br />Fight Club is a pugnacious challenge to examine your life, in the form of a blunt instrument. If you want to get peoples attention these days, best be prepared to bludgeon them upside the head. We the ADD generations have no time for study and meditation. You have 5 seconds to deliver the message in an original and exciting way. Check and check.<br /><br />Take a massively concentrated answer to the existential dilemma, throw in a couple themes of timely relevence, a sense of urgency, twisted humor and wrap up the whole enchilada in a transgressional tortilla and voila! A quintessential 90's literary masterpiece. Fight Club is the successor to Clockwork Orange.<br /><br />\\"This is your life, and it's ending one minute at a time\\"<br /><br />Consider yourself challenged.

B0017R5UAA|4.0|The album by the Fleet Foxes is a very pleasing album with a folk sound. It is wonderful to listen to on a cold winter day on your Ipod while you are sitting by the fire. The group shows great promise and I hope their future endeavors improve upon what they have started here. Definitely worth looking into if you enjoy folk music, or are looking for something different and new.

031606792X|5.0|In the last of the Twilight series, Stephenie Meyer has outdone herself. She saved the best for last. Some readers were put off by certain events in Breaking Dawn, but without those events the story wouldn't be the dazzling tale it is. We see the final series of events through the eyes of 3 different characters. They set us up for what is a truly fitting end to the best series of books I have read. Not even Harry Potter's 7 books could compare to the 4 books of Twilight. Even though Harry Potter got children to actually enjoy reading, more young adults and teens are turning to the Twilight series to further their love of reading. Without Stephenie Meyers Vampires and J.K. Rowling's Wizards and Witches the world would be a dark and scary place.  Be sure to read all of the Twilight books before delving into Breaking Dawn, you won't be disappointed.
B0013L2EDQ|3.0|It has always been a mystery to me why a lot of writers have a few good books and then a mediocre one. This is the fifth Rollins Book that I have read; two have been five star, [[ASIN:0060765372 Black Order: A Sigma Novel (Sigma Force Novels)]] and [[ASIN:0060521600 Ice Hunt]], and the others something less, like this one.<br /><br />Part of the plot was unrealistic such as four people were captured and all were kept alive as they traveled to other countries. One of these, a bodyguard, was kept alive by this vicious group that had no qualms about killing hundreds of innocent victims. Was this manufactured since he was used later on in the story? Another woman switched sides so many times it is unbelievable that either side would have trusted her more than once, or twice at the most.<br /><br />You had to set aside your disbelieve when it came to the group's code-breaking discussions and just skip over the dialog as you knew the answer would just pop-out from the discussion. A lot of the book was too wordy and an abridged version would have made for a better read.<br /><br />This was the fourth book in the Sigma Force series which is not a problem if only the main characters are carried forth from book to book, but Rollins seems to like to leave a question about some characters for resolution in the next book. Someone in a review for a previous Rollins book said they didn't understand why `Seichan' was even introduced but guess she would be needed in a later book. Well yes she was needed in this book and became one of the main characters but was allowed to escape at the end. Will she be in the next book?<br /><br />Other than what I mentioned here the book was well written and kept my interest but had an incomplete ending in several respects.
0743504984|5.0|I first got into Band of Brothers (BoB) after the DVD set was released.  But I decided I wanted to read the book version to get more of the details (and there is A LOT left out).  However, I picked up the audio version so I could listen to in during my commute to and from work.  And it REALLY passes the time.  Keeps you districted from the horrible traffic but not so much from driving itself.  Definitely recommended for that purpose.    My only gripe is that this is the abridged version and I still feel like I missed a lot of the details I was looking for.  So if you want to get the full effect...read the book.  But if you want something more entertaining that talk radio or the same 20 songs over and over again - this is a GREAT fit!!
B001DJ69E8|5.0|This album is some of the best, most dramatic music ever produced. I can't stop listening to it. It is invigorating, inspirational and it definitely strikes chords that resonate with the soul in many places, the way powerful music is supposed to. All the selections are great but number 4 (Serenata Immortale) conjures images of heaven and eternity like no other music I've heard. This company should really advertise their product more because this album could easily go platinum. If you buy no other musical score albums this year, buy this one.
0780626966|5.0|I bought The Nightmare On Elm Street Box Series around Halloween time, when it was on sale. It is AMAZING!!! I'm soooo glad I bought this item. It comes with every single nightmare on elm street movie, and it comes with 3D glasses for Freddy's Dead. The encyclopedia is great to have and to share with friends. The CD-Rom has a fun little maze game that has some great interviews and pictures. The box that the DVD's come in is magnificent, with its pop out art. I recommend this item to anyone who enjoys  The Nightmare On Elm Street series, its a great buy!
B001ECQ75A|5.0|A chubby, noodle slinging Panda named Po (voice of Jack Black) is utterly obsessed with kung fu.  He also happens to hold the title for being the most lethargic animal in the Valley of Peace.  Po is unexpectedly chosen to fulfill an ancient prophecy and become the dragon warrior.  He is then living out his dream of being a kung fu master, but it is rather short lived as he must learn quickly and battle the enemy that threatens to bring destruction into the Valley of Peace.    \\"Kung Fu Panda\\" adds to the growing list of animated kids movies that adults can enjoy.  It's an extraordinarily fun and funny (for all ages) movie to watch.  The story is put together well and will keep you entertained for the film's entirety.  Another big plus is the animation.  It looks so crisp and vivid.  There's so many positives to this film that it's hard to figure out which one is the secret ingredient.  After one viewing, you'll be kicking for another...just make sure you don't harm anyone.
B0018QCXH8|5.0|A beautiful tale of greed and consuming madness.  Wonderfully gritty and very beautiful yet maintains its early 20th century Upton Sinclair feel. Blu ray is the way to go.  Rich sharp viewing.
B001DZLAWI|3.0|It certainly is not nearly as good as the \\"black album\\".  It's not as bad as St. Anger. Yet unlike Toby Keith, they're not as good once, as they once were. A recurrent problem for me is thinking that I'm buying into a group at the zenith of their appeal to me. Metallica apparently is well past that. I can listen to this but all the cuts in a row is harder to take than it should be. Repetition tends to bore me and bored I am if I don't just listen to a select couple of tracks.<br /><br />I won't get rid of this (I bought the vinyl) nor will I transfer it to a disc. If I'd heard more than \\"The Day That Never Comes\\" before I bought it, I'd have passed on it.<br /><br />Bottom line: don't expect much.
B001CDLATE|4.0|Extremely beautiful and impressive blu ray title.  A little too eastern in terms of religious point of view.  Then again I suppose I have a western bias.
0061565571|5.0|I have all ready read \\"El tren de la media Noche\\" y \\"El principe de la niebla\\" and I can only say this one is my favorite...
B0000AQS0F|5.0|I've been a long-time sci-fi fan, from Star Trek to Farscape, but Firefly stands out as one of my very favorites.  The tragedy is that it was cancelled by Fox way before it's time.  I believe Fox made a huge error in judgement, taking what could have been the next sci-fi classic of X-Files proportions, and throwing it to the wind.  Thankfully, the movie \\"Serenity\\" gave us some kind of conlusion, yet I can't help but miss all the great stories that could-have-been between the TV series and the movie.  So, it will stand as one of my favorites, but that will always come with a touch of frustration that it could have been so much more.
0375831002|5.0|My book group chose this as our November selection -- even though we are between the ages of 46 - 55 and this is classified as YA.  It was wonderful !!<br /><br />This book follows Leisel Meminger from the age of 10 to 14 or so with an epilogue after her death.  She is a young German girl living in a small town outside of Munich during the days of Hitler/Nazi Party/World War II.  Her story is narrated by Death who talks about her life as well as those people closest to her such as her foster parents and neighbors.  The level of detail in the writing brings her story alive and is told in such a creative fashion that I'm sure I won't forget it for a long, long time and I will probably re-read again in the future.<br /><br />My father served in WW2 in Europe and was wounded in France by the Germans.  I have always viewed that time in history through an American lense.  This book really opened my eyes to what it must have been like for the German civilians caught up in the tyranny of the Third Reich and all the horrors of Hitler.  I had never really considered the event from their point of view and I am so glad I was given the opportunity.<br /><br />I would categorize this book as YA (not younger than high school) or adult fiction due to two things:<br /><br />1)  the novel is pretty graphic in places regarding war injuries as well as the horror the Jews suffered.<br /><br />2)  the narration can be jarring as it goes between Death and the \\"people\\" in the book.  While a 7th or 8th grade student would probably be fine with the vocabulary and the style, there would need to be a real effort put forward on their part.  I think it might feel more like a classroom literature assignment for that age group where, by waiting a year or two, they could truly enjoy it.<br /><br />A truly great book and highly recommended !
B00004TXFX|1.0|I ordered this with the expectation that I would be able to watch it.  I guess that if I lived in the U.K. I would be able to.  It is not viewable in the United States of America.  And since I have already opened it up and tried to play it on my D.V.D. player, there is no chance of getting a refund or exchange.  Live and learn, I guess.
B00127RAJY|5.0|This DVD workout is great motivation to get fit. The workouts are effective and even fun to do.
B00188M5TM|5.0|Beware.  To see it is to become emotionally involved with \\"Changeling.\\"  This is drama at its most intense.  Even if you don't imagine yourself as Mrs. Collins or her son, you will nonetheless empathize with them.  You will embrace their anxiety, fear, and terror.  You will imagine how they feel, alone and afraid.  And you will be horrified at the injustices they suffer at the hands of those who are supposed to defend and protect.<br /><br />Previous reviewers have explained the story so I'll try to tell you how it felt.  First, if you are drawn into the story like I was, the extended length of this movie is a blessing.  As the film approached a point where I knew conclusion would have been acceptable, I kept hoping, quite literally, for new life.<br /><br />Angelina Jolie is absolutely convincing as the single mother, Mrs. Collins.  No one does raw power, and simultaneously, sensual vulnerability, better than Jolie.  And Malkovich was very creative casting for the minister, a ruthless champion of justice.<br /><br />Clint Eastwood is now delivering movies with greater depth (in addition to violence, death, novelty and clever plot angles).  He is surrounding himself with plenty of seasoned talent, including Ron Howard (as one of the producers.)  In fact, I had difficulty finding any usual Eastwood watermarks.  That is, until the frail Mrs. Collins repeatedly slams the serial killer against the bars of the interview room, trying to get him to tell her whether he murdered her son.  I almost expected her to ask, \\"Do you feel lucky, punk?\\"  Actually, what I expected her to ask nearly everyone who worked against her, particularly the Police Captain and the various doctors, was \\"Do you have a soul?\\"<br /><br />From time to time during the film I listened to the audience in the theatre, such as when Mrs. Collins tells off the corrupt physician at the mental hospital. A few people, not yet engrossed by the horror of the situation, laughed (supportively).  Yet by the end of the film, when Mrs. Collins speaks to the detective, and when the credits rolled and the lights came up, you could have heard a pin drop.<br /><br />The most powerful moments where those times when Mrs. Collins' teetered on the verge of resignation - abandoned by her husband, confronted with the loss of her only child, and now surrounded by those who did not care, would not care, or were trying to hurt her.  Yet each time, with extraordinary courage and usually alone, she stood resolute against her worst fears.<br /><br />By a long shot however, the most emotional moment in the movie for me was the short scene of the boys in the chicken coop, with the brief image of the exhausted and dirt stained little Walter Collins.  If your heart didn't break at that moment, you don't have one.<br /><br />I would have suggested a different title, other than \\"Changeling,\\" which was a term used by the doctor at the mental hospital.  Before seeing the movie, the title \\"Changeling\\" seemed indicative of cheap Sci-Fi, rather than world class drama.  If you are a fan of 1920s period sets, the people who designed the physical backgrounds, clothing, and accessories for \\"Changeling\\" deserve an academy award for the quality and detail.<br /><br />Generally speaking, many people here in the modern United States have come to rely on trustworthy, lawful, and well-intentioned strangers who by the nature of their roles in society, generally act in ways we expect.  But what if you are vulnerable, weak, or threatening?  What if you are female, a minority, or foreign?  Experiences like these bring their own terrors.  Other movies which eloquently speak to these fears include \\"The Visitor,\\" and \\"Babel.\\"  I highly recommend all three.aks to the detective, and when the credits rolled and the lights came up, you could have heard a pin drop.    The most powerful moments where those times when Mrs. Collins' teetered on the verge of resignation - abandoned by her husband, confronted with the loss of her only child, and now surrounded by those who did not care, would not care, or were trying to hurt her.  Yet each time, with extraordinary courage and usually alone, she stood resolute against her worst fears.    By a long shot however, the most emotional moment in the movie for me was the short scene of the boys in the chicken coop, with the brief image of the exhausted and dirt stained little Walter Collins.  If your heart didn't break at that moment, you don't have one.    I would have suggested a different title, other than \\"Changeling,\\" which was a term used by the doctor at the mental hospital.  Before seeing the movie, the title \\"Changeling\\" seemed indicative of cheap Sci-Fi, rather than world class drama.  If you are a fan of 1920s period sets, the people who designed the physical backgrounds, clothing, and accessories for \\"Changeling\\" deserve an academy award for the quality and detail.     Generally speaking, many people here in the modern United States have come to rely on trustworthy, lawful, and well-intentioned strangers who by the nature of their roles in society, generally act in ways we expect.  But what if you are vulnerable, weak, or threatening?  What if you are female, a minority, or foreign?  Experiences like these bring their own terrors.  Other movies which eloquently speak to these fears include \\"The Visitor,\\" and \\"Babel.\\"  I highly recommend all three.

1596434252|4.0|I don't have kids.  But I do count three pre-schoolers among  my close friends and keep a stash of kids books on hand for their visits.  One day shortly after this book came in the mail, my 3 ½ year old pal Katie and her dad and younger brother came by  and  I asked them to give it a try.<br /><br />  Here's what I observed.  1. Adults are quick to appreciate the remarkable cleverness  of this alphabet book's design; kids of alphabet-learning age probably aren't.  2. The book's well constructed but also quite fragile, and requires some manipulation of some of the pages for some of the letters to be recognized.  Therefore it works best as a lap book in the hands of an adult, who'll both do the machinations needed to make the letters appear properly while at the same time protecting them and keeping them intact. 3. Except for the U, which is the book's star attraction and most fragile construction, Katie recognized and recited all the letters quite easily.  4. All this took just a few minutes,  after which Katie jumped off Dad's lap and went straight for my stash of \\"Olivia\\" books as usual and has expressed no further interest in this one.  5. Her Dad thought it would have more family value if it also included lower case.<br /><br /> I suspect this might be a great addition to the bookshelves of people who work one on one with lots of  little kids and people who teach design.  Meantime,  I intend to solicit additional reviews from my 4 ½ year old friend Riley as well as her grandmother Mary and good friend Linda who teach first and second grade.  If they have anything to add or disagree with in what's said here, I'll get back to you.<br /><br />OKAY, I TAKE IT ALL BACK. IGNORE THE FOREGOING. Like my experience with Katie, my first and second grade teacher-friends looked at this and instantly saw one of those books a kid looks at once and puts back on the shelf in favor of a story book.  BUT THEN...4 1/2 year old Riley got her hands on the thing and wouldn't let go. She now has it on permanent loan as she insists on showing it and demonstrating its 3D qualities to everyone who stops by.  The glue is starting to go on some of the letters but it's now clear that even if it doesn't last much longer, this book was well worth the money (had I spent any, but I got it for free)...at least for an especially visually oriented child.anent loan as she insists on showing it and demonstrating its 3D qualities to everyone who stops by.

B0002RQ2T4|5.0|One of the best animated films I have ever seen is a Japanese anime called KOKAKU KIDOTAI, otherwise known as \\"GHOST IN THE SHELL\\" (1995) Honestly, for those very unfamiliar with anime, its storyline can be quite difficult to follow; the maturity of its script and its psychological depth is far-reaching. Based on Masamune Shirow's manga (Japanese comic) with screenplay by Kazunoki Ito and directed by Mamoru Oshii, the film attained an award-winning worldwide acclaim not just because it revolutionized current animation standards but also because of its enormous plotline. The film heritage can be traced back to Ridley Scott's \\"Blade Runner\\" and the Japanese anime \\"Akira\\"; but it went on to inspire blockbuster Hollywood films such as \\"The Fifth Element\\", \\"Dark City\\" and even the Wachowski Bros'. \\"The Matrix\\". It is also the winner of the 1997 WORLD ANIMATION Celebration Awards. (Best Theatrical Film and Best Director)<br /><br />2029 A.D., a time and place in an undetermined future where the fusion of humans and machines, the network and human comprehension has been attained. People have been enhanced by cybernetic implants that makes them stronger, faster, smarter. Section 9, a group of cyborg cops led by Maj. Motoko Kisangani (voiced by Atsuko Tanaka) and Batou (Akio Atsuka) are caught in political intrigue as they search for answers to a mysterious \\"Puppet Master\\" or as it would like to call himself; Project 2501. Their investigations have led them to believe that this \\"ghost\\" hacker is the one responsible for numerous attacks on public mainframes that changed financial, network manipulations. Findings have led them to conclude that the \\"hacker\\" may be an artificial computer intelligence that seeks to co-opt a synthetic body for its own needs.<br /><br />This anime feature is a dramatic thrill-ride that would be an excellent introduction to Japanese animation with the depth of its script and the complexities of its plot. The story is so rich with philosophical undertones of existentialism and social relations. The cinematography is fantastic and the animated visuals is a \\"merging\\" or digitizing of traditional cell animation, computer generated graphics and live-action footage (although one would be hard-pressed to notice). The marvelous compositions and set pieces may cause one to forget that he is watching an animated film. The film is also shot with a lot of moving perspective to convey its mood. The animated invisibility (when Kusanagi gets totally naked) is a first during the time of its release While its premise is almost excellent, the visuals is also its main showstopper, even for today's standards.<br /><br />The film is a philosophical movie, and while there are quite a few sequences of action, one of which highlights Kusanagi going up against a robotic tank with enormous firepower, the film is full of emotional content, very brooding and quite moody. Shall I say it even contains quite a lot of drama with a restrained amount of human (?) angst. If you approach the film as you would any other action-inspired anime then you will be lost in its translation. The film may be a little slower-paced than most anime features but I found this very inspiring and a refreshing approach. It deliberately takes its time to express its mood through its slow-revelations. It is quite ingenious for director Oshii to abandon the usual dynamics of fast-paced scenes. It allows the viewer to ponder the different existential and social points it is making and take everything in.<br /><br />What makes an individual? What makes one attain individualism? Is it memories and experiences? The supposed thin line between humanity and cybernetics is drawn in the character of Maj. Kusanagi. She is a female operative who \\"died\\" before but is now able to live in an enhanced cyborg body. The main antagonist \\"the Puppet master\\" causes her to question her very existence--just how much of her is still human? How can one whose entire body is composed of cybernetics and synthetics be any different from a simple machine? Is Motoko Kusanagi a ghost in a cybernetic shell? Can a machine gain sentience through experiences and generate a \\"soul\\"? These are the complex questions that the film delves into--quite impressively I have to say.<br /><br />The film's main strengths are its groundbreaking visuals, mature and complex storyline and its reliance on emotion and mood rather than a hectic screenplay. Those who are looking for the usual \\"shoot them up\\" anime feature may be a little disappointed. While there is action to be had with \\"Ghost in the Shell\\", it is NOT an action animated film but a very philosophical sci-fi drama. I only have one response to those who question the reasons as to why Mamoru Oshii's masterpiece is so highly acclaimed, it paved the way to current animation techniques but it didn't stop there; it took its time with a mature and complex storyline that is definitely not for kids but for those esoteric few very adulterated to Japanese type of storytelling. Mamoru Oshii's \\"GHOST IN THE SHELL\\" surpasses most of Hollywood's big-budget output, BOTH in style and substance even up to this day. It wasn't a huge box-office success in its U.S. theatrical run, but nonetheless its thoughtful and interesting storyline cannot be matched  by any box-office popcorn giant--its non-mainstream appeal is its greatest strength. One of the great Sci-Fi masterpieces.<br /><br />HIGHLY RECOMMENDED!!

B001JJBO74|5.0|After reading an outstanding review in the New Yorker for this book, I went out and bought it, and have loved it. As that review says, it is a model for anyone who is interested in aesthetics, particularly talking about food and wine. It is a fantastic combination of art (whimsical, evocative, and funny descriptions) and science (describing the chemical families and compounds that make up perfumes). The authors provide a five star rating system for lots of perfumes, which makes for amusing reading (a friend who had just spent $100 on a perfume was shocked to hear it called \\"reminiscent of ham\\"), and has interested me in seeking out some of the five-star perfumes. This book also makes a great gift.
0937381888|5.0|I read \\"The Complete Joy of Homebrewing\\" by Charlie Papazian front to back and found myself not having a complete understanding of the entire brewing process, so I thought I would buy another book and after reading this one I was not at all disappointed. John Palmer describes the purpose of this book very well at its introduction; he says \\"(Brewing) sounds fairly simple, doesn't it? It really isn't any harder than baking a batch of cookies. What is difficult is understanding how to make cookies when you have never seen it done before. When you are done with this book, you will understand what you are doing, why you are doing it, and how to do it easily.\\" I couldn't have described this book better. The problem with most brewing books is they tell you what to do and what not to do, but they don't explain why you are (or aren't) doing something, just to do it and it works. While this book is a lengthy read, it goes into strong detail that made me feel \\"full\\" after each chapter. Then when I go to apply something I learned I find I have no questions left.    This book is like having a friend next to you that you can ask any question about and get a straight-forward, clear, scientific answer. There is even a section in the back labeled \\"Is My Beer Ruined?\\" where you can look up almost any problem you are having including 3 pages listing off-smells, their causes, and what you can do (if there is anything you can do) to fix them.     I cannot recommend this book any more for anybody that is learning to brew, or even advanced brewers that want a more scientific look at what they are already good at doing. Any knowledge is good, and after spending a good few days curled up with this book I personally guarantee the quality and understanding of your beer will improve.
0767827791|3.0|I ordered this film on DVD last week, and was very excited that I had finally purchased it on DVD.  Sat down to watch it, and was horrified that it was butchered (i.e. the full screen, pan-and-scan thing).  I went online today to see if I had accidentally chosen the wrong format, and found to my shock that this version is the only one out there.    I have to give it at least 3 stars, because the movie is so damned good. But this is a lousy transfer.  I find it hard to believe that at this late date in the DVD game, a new, improved, widescreen, digitally enhanced version has not been made.  How could such a classic film be ignored like this?  I strongly urge the powers that be to do this classic film justice - with maybe a \\"making-of\\" special, while some of the folks involved in its production are still alive, to add insight.    Please, PLEASE come out with a better version, and soon!

B001JOIEZ4|5.0|I don't know why people would think that the soundtrack to this movie wouldn't contain a fairly large amount of techno driven tracks... I mean Stephanie Meyers herself said she was driven by them when she was writing it.  I love this soundtrack, it's nice and fresh, not the same processed groups you see in techno driven soundtracks over and over again.  Rob Pattinson is a fresh voice, and creativeness that is needed for this type of movie soundtrack.  One of a kind sountrack for a one of a kind movie, isn't that how it should??  I am completely pleased with what I've heard here, and will listen to it more and more as the release date approaches.

B0009IW88A|5.0|If you're a fan of Hans Zimmer and James Newton Howard then you'll enjoy this album.  The movie was pretty good, but I was more interested in the music composed for the movie.  Each one of these songs is heart throbbing, period.  I think you will enjoy this album, particularly because of the design made by Zimmer and Howard.  Another movie to compare to would be 'Black Hawk Down' by Zimmer.  As usual, his soundtracks are some of the greatest.  It seems these days that I listen to soundtracks more than typical music.    I often listen to artists like Andrea Bocelli and music by Zimmer, Howard, Isham, and Goldsmith (to name a few).  I can't say enough about this album and am sure you will enjoy it.  If you crank up the bass on your sub woofer, you'll experience an amazing throb of bass from the different songs.    You can also compare this album to Zimmer's 'Tears of the Sun', which by the way was also a great movie, including the soundtrack.    Enjoy.

B001GCUNVW|5.0|THE WRESTLER is the first film I've seen in 2008 which has my unqualified recommendation for an Oscar nomination, specifically for the performance of Mickey Rourke as the aging wrestler, Randy \\"Ram\\" Robinson.<br /><br />As the film opens, the camera pans over a montage of publicity stills and fight posters from the heyday of Ram's career in the 1980s. Now, it's twenty years later, and Randy is on the down slope of Over-the-Hill. He lives alone in a New Jersey trailer park. His only family is his estranged daughter Stephanie (Evan Rachel Wood), and his only \\"girlfriend\\" is apparently the aging stripper Cassidy (Marissa Tomei) whom he pays for private dances in a local strip joint.<br /><br />Ram is a one-trick pony; wrestling is his life and livelihood, both of which are endangered after one particularly strenuous and bloody bout involving a staple gun, barbed wire, and a fork. Confronted with a fundamental change to his existence, the audience watches him cope with loneliness and a growing despair. Perhaps the most poignant scene takes place in a meeting hall in which he and other has-beens of the profession are set up at card tables to hawk autographed photos and other memorabilia to a dwindling number of fans. As he gazes at his graying colleagues with their crutches, ice packs, and leg braces, the pathetic nature of his twilight career hits home.<br /><br />As evidenced by the end credits, the film heavily involved professional wrestlers both as advisors and cast members. Presumably then, the depiction of the sport, if it can be called such, is credible. But it's obvious that professional wrestling, like stripping, is more in the nature of staged performance art. Yes, perhaps the viewing audience has always suspected this to be true of the former, but THE WRESTLER drives home the point with a revelatory cinema verite.<br /><br />Tomei does a swell job as Cassidy, who, off-stage, is single-Mom Pam with a nine-year old son. Cassidy isn't getting the requests or tips for private dances that she used to in her younger days, and her prospects for the future, though not yet as dismal as Ram's, suggest a similar slide. (But, I tell you what, Marissa Tomei pole dancing at almost 44 is Hot!)<br /><br />Ultimately, THE WRESTLER proves enormously sad. Yet, for any viewer who works for a living, whether it be at a blue or white-collar job, the realization must perhaps be that each of us is but a performance artist, and, if one is but a one-trick pony, the end of the show's run has the potential to be devastating if experienced without a human support net.<br /><br />I don't write movie reviews much anymore because most Big Screen releases aren't worth the effort. THE WRESTLER is an emphatic exception.sed to in her younger days, and her prospects for the future, though not yet as dismal as Ram's, suggest a similar slide.

0575081406|5.0|I liked this book a lot. It was original, compelling, and very well-written (with the exception of a couple typos). I didn't want to leave off reading it. If you like fantasy, this is a breath of fresh air. There aren't any ideas ripped off from other books and tweaked; rather it is the story of a young man who seems to be a genius, though not wise as much as smart. There are a few demons, forces of evil, etc but we aren't wallowing in it as much as in other books. Rather it's a character study, and a very good one. It has an interesting structure, being a first-person story interrupted with brief interludes that take us out of the story and show us the storyteller in the present time, in third-person point-of-view. I can't wait to continue Kvothe's (good name!) saga in the next book!
0143038419|3.0|I truly enjoyed this book. Is it sappy?..yes, a little. Narcissitic?...maybe, a little. Offensive?...not to me, not even a little.     When I read this book I was going through a very difficult time in my own life. While I didn't have the money to take a year off from life, I read this book and allowed myself to be carried off through the authors enlightening journey. I had so many of the same questions, the same thoughts, and too many same experiences sobbing on the bathroom floor.     I found the ironic, sarcastic humor funny and perfectly timed and the authors experiences and frustrations with the healing process genuine.     This may not be a book all women can enjoy, but if you are in a hard place, struggling to find yourself, exploring spirtuality, or if you just enjoy reading a book about travels to interesting places; keep on open mind and give it a try.

The viewing was like going back to the original for the FIRST 5 MINUTES OF THE MOVIE, then the boredom set in and a stupid plot and a hard to believe ending, come on it's 2008 we are not that easily taken in buy this poor plot and acting. Ford appears in most scenes with the look and sound that he is on his last legs and it is such an effort to continue.    The Direction by Speilberg is his worse yet, the movie just does not gell.  I was amazed how much we are ment to believe, that the Russians were everywhere in the 50's and took over anywhere in the U.S. at will.    The best part of the Movie for me was the opening shot with Elvis singing Hound Dog over the cars racing in the desert. This is a case of money not well spent, the only saving grace in this Movie was Ray Winston's solid preformance, sorry I can't say that about the rest of the cast.

B001BN1ZHW|5.0|Most of Tim Burton's movies are a lot of fun to watch and amazing to look at.  However, a lot of the times the narratives tend to be less than compelling and even though they were amazing to look at, everything else fades from memory quite quickly.  Notably exceptions being \\"The Nightmare Before Christmas\\" and \\"Ed Wood\\".  Now comes, \\"Sweeney Todd: The Demon Barber of Fleet Street\\" which is the most delicious work (pun intended) Burton has delivered in his twenty plus year as a director.      To me \\"Sweeney Todd: The Demon Barber of Fleet Street\\" plays out like an evil version of one of those Disney animated musical from the early nineties.  Those movies seemed to be composed of two young lovers from different worlds who have to go to impossible ends to be with each other, and the girl often has a overbearing yet loving father, and there is always a villain to make sure the girl and boy are kept apart.  In this story the villain interferes with the girls life when she is a mere infant.    As the movie opens \\"Sweeney Todd(played flawlessly by Johnny Depp), formerly Benjamin Barker is returning to London after fifteen years of exile after being brought up on a false charge.  The audience quickly learns that Benjamin Barker had a wife named Lucy who he was madly in love with, but so was the unscrupulous Judge Turpin (Alan Rickman) who has Barker sent away so he can take the wife as his own.  After many rejections by the woman, the Judge takes Mrs. Barker by force, driving her mad.  And to make things even better for the family the Judge Turpin adopts Barker's daughter Johanna to raise as his own, and imprison her as she blossoms into womanhood with the intent of marrying her.    Shortly after returning to London Todd returns to his home, which is above a shopped own by Helena Boham-Carter-Burton's Mrs. Lovett, who happens to sell the worst meat pies in London.  Mrs. Lovett realizes right away that Sweeney Todd is really Benjamin Barker and takes an immediate liking to him.  In the meantime Todd's imprisoned daughter, Johanna, spies a sailor (the same sailor who delivers Todd to London) and the two fall instantly in love.    Now in most Disney animated movies the action is centered on the young lovers while the adults are put in the background.  Most of the action here is on Sweeney Todd, a moping monster whose only purpose in life is to have revenge for the wrongs done to him.     This movie is interesting in many ways, namely the relationship between Mr. Todd and Mrs. Lovett.  It's obviously she will do anything to win his affection.  However, he is indifferent to her unless she is able to help him get his revenge.  There are several scenes in which Todd speaks to Mrs. Lovett as if she is just a distraction.  Despite his bitter rage and nastiness Mrs. Lovett still dreams of moving to the sea and getting married to Mr. Todd.   One of the best scenes in the movie is when it seems as if Todd is about to open up to Mrs. Lovett and then a clue about how to get his revenge on the judge comes his way, and she is instantly forgotten.    Judge Turpin has to be the nastiest  villain in all of Tim Burton's movies. And these are villains that include the Joker, the Penguin, blood thirsty Martians, and the boogie man.  This guy not only destroys a family on the whim of his own lust, he intends to marry the daughter.  The fact that the daughter falls for the young sailor puts her in a terrible situation.    And there this is Mrs. Lovett.  Here is a character with the morals of a half starved alley cat.  She thinks murder is inexcusable unless it is justified (A character tries to bribe Sweeney Todd) or if it can be to her benefit (Using the bodies of victims to boost her pie selling business).  Part of the greatness of her role is how nonchalantly she reacts to the murders of several people as long as she stands to gain by them.    As great as the story is I can honestly stay Johnny Depp and Helena Bonham-Carter can both hold their own as singers.  Alan Rickman, great actor, but not so much.  The atmosphere of the sets also contribute to the melancholy feel of this movies.  Tim Burton has made violent, bloody movies before but they always tended to have an upbeat tone.  As I said, it reminded me if an evil Disney movie.  After seeing  \\"Beauty and the Beast\\" I left the theater humming the songs.  After this one I walked out feeling like I just had attended a funeral.  Still, this is an elegant movie and Burton's best work.      Final note...the blu ray quality is very good, but not great.
B001AGXEAG|4.0|Maybe the definitive Burton film (or maybe more like a tie with `Edward Scissorhands'), `Beetlejuice' is a perfect representation of what Tim Burton is all about.  It is loud and boisterous and at the same time dark and edgy.  The film very much looks and feels like almost everything that comes out of the Burton factory, yet it is surprisingly fresh in a way.  Maybe this has to do with the fact that it is one of his earlier works and so the colors and graphics are not as crisp, which adds an almost gothic layer to the films feel.<br /><br />Then again, maybe it is the mere fact that Michael Keaton gives the best performance in any Burton film; ever.<br /><br />The film follows Adam and Barbara as they learn to cope with life after death.  Yes, a horrific car accident leaves Adam and Barbara dead yet confined to their home.  The problem is that their impatient neighbor takes no time in selling their home to an eccentric family that does not meet with their approval.  Determined to remove these people from their home they enlist the help of a `bio-exorcist' to do the trick, but they get far more than they bargained for when Beetlejuice comes on the scene.<br /><br />The film has been labeled as `pointless fun' by most of my friends, and to an extent I have to agree.  Many would claim the film is not pointless, for it teaches lessons of acceptance and friendship, and I guess loyalty and respect, but really, are we concerned with any of that?<br /><br />The acting is really good here, and it elevates the film from `pointless' to `pointless fun'.  Alec Baldwin and Geena Davis (complete with those alien eyes she had popping in `The Fly') are absolutely amazing as the dead couple, Adam and Barbara.  Catherine O'Hara is marvelous, award worthy even, as the insanely annoying Delia, and Jeffery Jones knows just how to compliment her as Charles.  Winona Ryder is effectively weird as their daughter Lydia.<br /><br />This film belongs to Keaton though, in what may very well be his finest performance, ever.  There is a fine line to be ridden between hilariously on-point and drastically over-the-top; especially when you are dealing with a typically campy performance.  As Beetlejuice, Keaton finds that line and rides it well, delivering an all over the place comedic performance that never feels `too much', even though it probably is.  He understands how to make his characters insanity justifiably funny and makes him an iconic character.  Everyone knows who Beetlejuice is, even if you haven't seen the movie.<br /><br />In the end I can recommend this movie because it does the trick.  It's sweet and charming in that Tim Burton style, complete with edge and creeps and hilarious thrills.  It looks better than his new stuff because it still has a level of grit, and while it is not as good as `Edward Scissorhands' (his best movie, ever) it is definitely a film that every fan needs to see.e is a fine line to be ridden between hilariously on-point and drastically over-the-top; especially when you are dealing with a typically campy performance.

0790729377|4.0|A Streetcar Named Desire released in 1951 was a true classic by Tennesse Williams.  This took place in the dreadful years following World War II in the French Quarter of New Orleans.  Williams created an amazing character Blanche DuBois, acted by Vivien Leigh.  Blanche is the main character, a delicate and anxious young woman who has come to live with her sister Stella and her sisters husband Stanley to lead a new beginning.  Vivien Leigh as well as Marlon Brando (Stanley), Kim Hunter (Stella) and Karl Malden (Mitch) all helped revolutionize American cinemas to what they have become today.  This film was outstanding and very well known as ahead of its time.
B001G60FTI|2.0|Blink! what seemed like a fascinating subject pulled me in and then after 100 pages I put it down. Just like that, in a flash of a moment or a blink, I decided I can't finish this book.

I have to buy a new one. My daughter loves all of the chipmunk stories. I'm hoping none of the stories have changed. My favorite if \\"the polite elephant\\". Whenever my children go to friends houses I tell them to remember to be a polite elephant- and if you know the story, you know what a wonderful positive thing that is for children to know and emulate.

B001GZ6QDS|5.0|This movie was in the making for several years and it was more than worth the wait. Being one of the few sequals that actually surpass is predecessor, The Dark Knight offers a reflection of the modern world and the problems that plague society; from the costs of justice, to the means in which you are willing to achieve it. Christian Bale is as powerful as ever in his depiction as the Cape Crusader and brings the intensity of DC best creation to life. Morgan Freeman and Michael Cane undoubtedly bring life to the supporting characters that aid the hero in this film. Maggie Gyllenhaal  brings more believability to Rachel Dawes than did Katie Holmes. Aaron Eckhart-if people didn't know who he was before, they will know his name now. However, the greatest performance in this motion picture is that of late actor Heath Ledger as the Joker. Bringing a twisted, psychotic villain that not even legendary Jack Nicholson accomplished is a crowning achievement in a career that ended tragically short, but Ledger gave a performance that is definitively his own and worthy of being called GREAT. Also this film does a excellent job of reflecting the modern world with all of its problems. Presenting the same questions that exist with the War on Terror, The Dark Knight asks the questions how far are you willing  to go to do what needs to be done, and is it worth the cost?

0374530718|5.0|This is a brilliant book sweeping you through history and introducing highly inspirational characters from different periods of time around the world. Even though it is described as 'A Novel About The History of Philosophy', it is barely that. To me a lot of excerpts from the words of legends such as Plato or Socrates made a lot of sense and seemed to run on logic. The novel features a girl called Sophie who receives letters from an unknown philosopher who teaches her a lot about life and the way things work. She learns and absorbs as much as she can, and soon you find that you are indeed the 'Sophie' in the story, and the book is indeed the 'Unknown Philosopher'! This book is a masterpiece that will keep you thinking till the end and after. Its a timeless wonder.\\"

B000M5AJQI|5.0|The title of this review pretty much says it all.  There is not a lot of action in this flick, but the music is killer.  The blu-ray audio enhances this.  Visually, on my system, the blacks are black and the colors are brilliant.  I highly recommend this movie for blu-ray.
0441013597|4.0|I first read \\"Dune\\" when it was originally published,  I enjoyed it.  Paul seemed to be an interesting and complex character.  I read it two or three times since then.  My opinion did not improve.  There are two or three spots in the story where I get bored.  Also, the story-line has always seemed a bit far-fetched to me.  I always wish for more true hard science fiction and less of the psychic stuff.    While I rate it at four stars, I, honestly, do not understand why this book has gotten the huge reputation that it has.
0345479092|5.0|I loved this book! I read it before my son was born (first and only child). I was very scared about becoming a mom because of all the horror stories I heard. This book really helped me to feel like hard times were completely normal and to be expected but that I could handle them without being a failure.     One of the most important things to know before reading ANY parenting book is that every child is different. No child will respond the same way and not everything will work for every child. The key is to find what works for you and your child. Be openminded. For that reason I think it is important to take parenting advice as an outline/template and not to expect to replicate it exactly. Tracy Hogg's suggestions worked great for us.    Most of the book focuses on learning to discern the needs of your baby in order to make life easier for baby and mom and dad. I use many of Tracy's techniques and I feel like I am more capable of meeting my sons needs, which help him to feel loved and comfortable and also help me to feel like a more competent mother. It boosts my confidence and helps me to love being a mom.     Breastfeeding: Contrary to other reviewers, I felt like Tracy Hogg favored breastfeeding, but made it a point to help bottle feeding mothers feel like they weren't ruining their child's life. My sister tried breastfeeding, but had troubles and wasn't able to continue and it was very hard for her. Tracy was just reassuring those mothers who choose formula that their child can still be happy and healthy. It is true that she does not believe in on-demand feeding. But I also don't think she would tell a mom not to feed her child if he/she is hungry. I feed my son whenever he is hungry, but when I am reading his cues correctly, his body NATURALLY conforms to a regular schedule (exceptions during growth spurts of course).    EASY Program: Tracy suggests putting your child on a schedule, but I don't think she ever intended it to be strict. The purpose behind the EASY program is to make it easier for mom or dad to determine what baby needs. If the EASY program is implemented to fit YOUR family, it will help to establish a sense of routine and calmness, which will help your baby feel safe and comfortable as he settles into life.    Many reviewers felt Tracy's ideas were rigid and cruel to babies. I don't agree. I think they can be if they are followed too strictly, ignoring the needs of your baby in order to follow a program. I don't believe that is the way Tracy intended her ideas to be implemented. Not every baby will adopt the kinds of problems that Tracy encountered in her career, but many babies may and her suggestions are intended to help prevent those problems if your child is prone to them. I don't think there is anything wrong with rocking your child to sleep, letting them sleep in your arms, nursing them to sleep, etc. as long as it doesn't become routine everyday/all day, because that is when the problems will begin to establish themselves.    Another major idea behind Tracy's advice is that you must take care of yourself in order to properly take care of your child. Many reviewers see her ideas as selfish, but I see them as an important part of being a mom. I think it is increasingly more difficult to meet the needs of your baby if you don't meet the needs of yourself especially if you are breastfeeding. Tracy's ideas encourage mothers to find a happy medium between spending time with baby and spending time for yourself so that you can also be physically and emotionally healthy. I love my son more than anything, but I still need time to be me and enjoy things for myself and I don't think there is anything wrong with putting a little time aside for me. It keeps me sane so I can continue to enjoy being a mom without feeling like my son is taking away everything I used to enjoy.    I would definitely recommend this book to others. I would also recommend reading additional books and not sticking to just one.
B0019T9FL6|5.0|I was so excited when Jen's CD came out in September. I purchased 5 copies at first, and a few more after that (as Christmas presents). While I do have my favorites on the CD, I think that overall, this is a great first release. I was hoping for more mid-tempo songs like Spotlight or What's Wrong, but thought that Pocketbook was definitely a surprise (a welcomed one). I probably have listed to \\"Invisible\\" at least a 200 times, that would definitely have to be my favorite and I absolutely love \\"If This Is Isn't Love\\", and recently been listening to \\"My Heart\\" a lot more recently as well. So those are my top 3 right now. I like that she blows on all of her songs, but I definitely wouldn't change a thing. I hope everyone who has followed her since American Idol will go out and support her.    Steph P.   (Washington, DC)

B001G60FTI|3.0|I found this a tremendously interesting read:  during two days or so it took me to read it, I really couldn't put it down.  (A teacher, I put my students to work doing a bunch of soul-crushing busy work so I could finish reading it during classtime.)<br /><br />It's full of great anecdotes, and Gladwell has a lucid and engaging style.<br /><br />The problem is this:  as far as what Gladwell's actually saying, his observations don't sum to much.<br /><br />The basic thesis -- as I'm sure you know -- is that people in certain walks of life are frequently found to exhibit eerily reliable snap judgments, whereby they can arrive at the core of (what seem to us) monstrously complex problems in only a second or two.<br /><br />Fair enough.  The phenomenon certainly exists.  Gladwell documents it well and you find yourself convinced that he's not making this up.<br /><br />Alas.  The book attempts to go further than that, and that's where it falls flat.<br /><br />Gladwell never successfully articulates exactly how it is that his various \\"thin-slicers\\" actually work their magic.  Further, he fails to give proper weight to the counter-evidence:  loads of cases where snap judgments fail.  Offhand, I would imagine that judging situations based on one's initial impression is, on average, a dumb way to go most of the time (even perilous in some contexts).<br /><br />But so enthusiastic is Gladwell about the laundry-list of exceptions he has collected that it's almost to the point where he's implying that preternatural snap judgments are USUALLY reliable, rather than OCCASIONALLY reliable.  Which is quite the daring claim.<br /><br />Finally, Gladwell fails to provide any guidance on the question of how one could systematically learn to hone such a skill, assuming that it can even exist in one's discipline (I remain to be convinced that snap judgments have a role to play in all walks of life).<br /><br />The end result of these shortcomings is that the only thing \\"Blink\\" does effectively is point out that the phenomenon exists.  By itself this is not terribly useful.terribly useful.
B001GZ6QDS|5.0|Hands down one of the best movies ever made. Dark, deep, everything a Batman film SHOULD be. To whoever was bashing this movie, you are not an intelligent person. Stick with corny Spider Man sequels and leave amazing films like this to the adults. This is definitely not a movie I would show to my 1 yr old son...or to anyone under the age of 12. Very dark, evil and somewhat disturbing. In a very good way though. No more needs to be said. Not only my personal favorite comic book adaptation film ever but one of my favorite films ever, period. Loved it.

However it is interesting point of view on personal style. Some shops from her lists can also be useful. I won't recommend this book to start with if you want to build your new look or wardrobe. But some tips can be interesting to adopt as unusual accent in someone's existing style.
B000YAA68W|4.0|We have become accustomed to slick, technically amazing cartoons produced by Disney and Pixar. Here is something completely different -- an animated movie produced by humans drawing with pencils on paper in black and white where the emphasis is on the story. We experience the Iranian Islamic Revolution and its brutal aftermath through the eyes of one young Iranian girl and her family.<br />This is recent history that needs to be retold and remembered because Iran looms so large on the world stage today. With its president spewing hatred on Israel and its scientists racing to acquire a nuclear weapon, we should remember how these extremists came to power and what they did to their own people once they had grasped it.<br />The movie is scrupulously fair, depicting the brutality of the Shah followed by the much greater savagery of the Islamic regime which succeeded it. We see women harassed for \\"improper\\" dress, parties busted, families searched for illegal alcohol. We see the hardship and suffering Iranians had to endure during the 8-year war with Iraq. Most of all, we see the effect of such intolerance and extremism on the delicate psyche of one bright, intelligent woman who wants nothing other than to grow up to be free and to realize her potential.<br />There are many charming and funny incidents in this movie -- it's not a complete downer. The serious story it tells is one we can all identify with.
0765315246|5.0|This was a highly entertaining and fast-faced look at what war may be like in the future.  The history of characters connected me to the individuals and I was upset when they were gone.<br /><br />I can't wait to read the next book in the series.
B0009A41WE|3.0|One shouldn't judge Mitsuko Uchida's Beethoven from this pallid, under-inflected concerto cycle. She went on to  make a magnificent \\"Hammerklavier\\" Sonata recording full of strength and conviction. Both are lacking here, however, and one wonders if this highly intelligent artist wasn't trying to adopt a new style in these works that is purposefully light and sparkling rather than the masculine drive that immpels most Beethoven playing.<br /><br />If so, she is seriously undone by Sanderling, who simply seems old and tired. His conducting is proficient enough, but there's no energy. Was Uchida doing her best in the face of a conductor coasting through the score? There are long stretches of alluring keyboard work, and Uchida does well overall, I think, in the Fourth Cto., but expect Clara Haskil here, not Rudolf Serkin.<br /><br />Beethoven concerto cycles have been oddly unlucky, with disappointments from Brendel, Ashkenazy, Katchen, Perahia, Pollini, and now Uchida, all of whom seem to find these works uninspiring. To fhear really satisfying performances, you have to pick and choose, and even then the great ones linger in the past.
B001ED7C58|3.0|I've read and am now rereading these books and I've been waiting to hear what Bella's Lullaby would be. When I saw this CD out I quickly bought it just for Bella's Lullaby. I'm disappointed with it. I like the cd but Bella's Lullaby just sounds all wrong to me. I found a much better one on Myspace that just feels right for this book. All in all it's a great CD, I like the music, but I was very very disappointed by Bella's Lullaby....does not seem right for how Stephenie Meyer wrote about this song.
B000068FXR|4.0|Throw all your preconceptions out the door.  This is not really \\"rock\\" because there is really nothing to protest or be angry about.  It's not \\"pop\\" because what Supertramp sings about is highly personal and complex.<br /><br />This music shows people at their most vulnerable.  Who of us growing up did not feel being completely isolated and misunderstood?  It's so poignant and sad, but it never gets sappy.<br /><br />I still don't know how Roger Hodgson can sing a song like \\"The Meaning\\" or a 7 minute masterpiece like \\"Hide in Your Shell\\" off the Crimes of the Century album, and keep me \\"right there\\" with him the entire time.  It's inexplicable.<br /><br />Also, you have Rick Davies on keyboard, who has a more sarcastic, abrasive voice, and which is a perfect counterpoint for Roger's voice.  It's kind of like Roger Daltrey and Pete Townshend of The Who.  They're able to express the full gamut of young male adult emotions.<br /><br />Sit back and enjoy!
B0014DZ2VO|3.0|So they hired two guys affiliated with the Bourne series to help with this film. But if it's James Bourne-y, it's in a bad way - the idiotic, stupid shaking-camera style that makes the action unintelligible, even car chases and boat chases. Bond's escape from an elevator is a prime example of this terrible filming style. Something happened in there, but what? These shakey camera fools must be stopped!<br /><br />It's somewhat unfair, though, to complain - as some critics (and on-screen characters) have - about his killing too many people vs. taking them alive - in many cases, he's left no choice. It's kill or be killed in many pretty stressful situations.<br /><br />The hand-to-hand action is sparse but better than in the other Bonds - something more lethal-looking than the comical fisticuffs we usually see (though Brosnan's swordfight was fun). I mean, Bond should have had some martial arts training, right? Still, the Bourne idiots ruin the action with their wild camera movements.<br /><br />I didn't enjoy it as much as Royale, but it is a character piece - somewhat confusing, though. Has he come to terms with Vesper? Yes and no, it seems. The \\"field burial\\" scene of a fellow agent is also confusing. The film brings on what looks like tender moments, then seems to discard them as brutally as Bond casually discards various objects on-screen. And it looks like he uses a fellow-agent as a bullet shield in one instance, though I can't be sure. Cold. But I like this brooding Bond.<br /><br />On the other hand, we get a glimpse of his loyalty and perhaps affection for M, and how he sees her - a surrogate mother.<br /><br />Also, interestingly, Bond has to make do with various clunky forms of transport; it's his enemies that have the shiny boats and aircraft. In keeping with the reboot, he gets dirty and bleeds quite a bit.<br /><br />The theme song was widely panned by critics, but I found that it grows on you (well, it grew on me) and I now sometimes enjoy just viewing the opening sequence, which is very well designed and choreographed. The lyrics are well done, too. And, of course, I love the harmony line they've added for the Bond theme fanfare.<br /><br />Is Dominic Greene supposed to look like Al Gore? I don't know, although he kind of does. But he makes a poor man's villain, in a climax that is underwhelming. However, perhaps the Gore connection is significant - like Greene, his \\"save the earth\\" hypocrisy is despicable. Although all the \\"science\\" in his film has now been debunked - it cannot be shown in the UK without a disclaimer to that effect - Gore stands to make millions for his business partners and himself if his demands for alternate energy are met, while he is content to continue guzzling 20 times the normal person's energy ration. (google \\"al gore carbon footprint\\" to get an idea.) Rations are for little people.<br /><br />The worldview presented - talking and plot points - is somewhat naive and simpleminded. Case in point - the CIA is playing ball with brutal dictators for ... oil, what else? There's also a message about how our intelligence services should only deal with \\"good guys\\" - the mistake the Clinton administration made which led to a dearth of on-the-ground intel. But as M's superior points out, what are they supposed to do? Let the bad guys get all the oil? (The Brits should know; it was the superiority of their oil-burning ships - Churchill's hard-won cause - that let them sink the German navy.) More naivete: The locations are meant to contrast between the \\"evil and rich\\" West and the poor, victimized rest of the world. Never mind that their misery is usually the result of their own dictatorships.<br /><br />There's something in there about global warming, thankfully brief (perhaps purposely so, since most scientists now know the earth has been *cooling* for the past few years, and the latest IPCC admission shows that only perhaps 5 *actual* scientists - not 2,500 - agreed with its conclusion that any warming is man-made). In this movie hybrid cars abound, even in Haiti. But, hey, it's all movie make-believe, so take it with a drop of oil and enjoy it.t, hey, it's all movie make-believe, so take it with a drop of oil and enjoy it.
0156030209|3.0|Life of Pi is a very interesting book once you get past the beginning. In the whole first part of the book, I had to force myself to read it. I would have stopped if the book was not assigned for school. Yann wrote about topics as if he had just watched a show on The Animal Planet and wanted to tell us about why animals did certain things like escaping from their enclosure. But after I got past that part, which put me to sleep. I could not stop reading. He describes Pi's adventure with so much detail that it was practically a movie in the form of words. He really gives a lot of personality to the tiger; Richard Parker. Richard Parker is such a huge role and I think it is very hard to describe an animal's personality with such detail.   If you can get past the first part of the book, you will enjoy the rest of the story. All i can say is that Yann wrote with so much detail that it ties you to the two main characters, Richard Parker and Pi.

B001ESYAJY|4.0|This is a really crackingly good James Bond score. On his fifth outing as composer, David Arnold has created a work that is both listenable and catchy.    I'll admit right away, I am firmly in the camp that has cringed through Arnold's work on three out of the five previous, John-Barryless films. Arnold's love of sequenced layers of percussive turmoil drowned out any semblance of melody and the James Bond theme was plastered on with a trowel at various moments when other ideas had obviously run out.    Thankfully, all this seems to be changing now. Casino Royale began a return to proper Bond form and Quantum of Solace has taken it still further. Even the wierd, faux Live and Let Die title song is properly referenced and included throughout, albeit as a variation.    It's really nice to see David Arnold getting more melody into the dramatic passages of his Bond scores. Not that it was totally absent before, but he did have a tendency not to stick with any one idea long enough for it to remain memorable. This may beslightly true of some portions of the action music in Quantum of Solace but it has to be said, this work stands head and shoulders above his previous efforts.    Bond is starting to like Bond once more.      Footnote: If I were David Arnold, given Eon Productions' erratic hiring rendencies, I'd now be worried for my job. Main title designer, Danny Kleinman did some of his best work on Casino Royale and was rewarded by getting dumped from this outing.
1401322425|4.0|I bought this book from a large-scale book store for full price (doh!) only a few days ago, and I'm eager to cook many of these recipes.  The directions are concise and clear, the photos are gorgeous, and the meals themselves seems like a dream come true.  The book even includes educational tidbits on meat cuts, asparagus nutrients, etc.  The only reason I give this cookbook 4 out of 5 stars is because the recipes aren't all that practical for every-day cooking, especially at every-day salaries.  I'll have to spend five times the money (time aside) to make homemade french onion soup instead of buying some in a jar, and my favorite recipe in this book (guinness, beef, and cheese pie) will require 3 hours and 15 minutes of oven time alone.  I would say this recipe book is much more usable than the NYT cookbook, which I find to be a little pretentious, but not as easy to implement as the Moosewood cookbook.  However, this one has amazing non-vegetarian dishes in it.  I'm definitely going to impress my boyfriend with this stuff.

0743298039|5.0|First of all, I applaud Diane Setterfield, the author, for writing such a novel. I believe it must be a challenge to craft a story that is entirely plausible yet gripping and puzzling and unique.    The central character in The Thirteenth Tale is Margaret Lea, a reticent young woman who is the only child of parents who own a bookshop. I say parents, though it is Margaret's father who is the book expert who spends most of each day in the shop with Margaret. The father and daughter share a tender closeness that adds to the humanity of the book.     Margaret confesses that her love for books actually transcends her feeling for many of the people she knows. Her delight is to slip into bed each evening with a hot cup of cocoa on her bedside table and read for hours into the night. As she has a treasure trove of literary works at her fingertips and enjoys various genres of books, including historical accounts and biographies, she becomes intrigued at times by rather obscure figures in history and takes it upon herself to write small biographies on these men and women, which she occasionally has published.     Her work becomes noticed by a Miss Vida Winter, England's best-known author of her time. Out of the blue, Margaret receives a letter from Miss Winter, requesting Margaret's services to write her life's story. Margaret accepts the position, moves to Miss Winter's estate, and later learns that Miss Winter has given twelve earlier accounts of her life to various biographers, which she confesses have all been untrue. As Miss Winter relates the true account of her life to Margaret, what unfolds is a fascinating tale involving generations of a wealthy, recluse family with a truly dysfunctional lifestyle. There are whisperings of ghosts and ages-old family secrets, which are dark and disturbing.     What transpires is that Margaret grows and learns much about herself, as she first listens and then begins to investigate the truthfulness of Miss Winter's tale. Some pleasant resolutions occur regarding Margaret's and Miss Winter's lives toward the end of the book, which give a nice wrap-up to the many threads of plot woven throughout the story. Along the way, however, there are several cringe-worthy moments and mysterious occurrences that keep the reader riveted.     I will say that the story began a bit slowly for me, but I appreciate how Setterfield takes her time to include elegant descriptions of scenes and feelings and situations. The writing is superb. Also, I appreciate that this work does not include the vulgarity, profanity, violence, and sexual inappropriateness so prevalent in so many of today's novels.     Diane Setterfield is a gem, a writer with an elevated and praiseworthy style. Her tale is a moral one, with honorable characters who display acts of kindness and service, despite some genuinely troubling circumstances. This is definitely a novel worth reading.
B00005JPO1|3.0|I anticipated the release of the latest in the Indiana Jones series with great expectations.  Unfortunately, I felt that those expectations were only partly met.     I didn't expect that this fourth installment would be able to top number three; after all Sean Connary and Harrison Ford in the same movie is a pretty tough act to follow.  However, I didn't expect a movie that couldn't even equal the quality of the second.     Just as with \\"Indiana Jones and the Temple of Doom\\", I felt that parts of the overall storyline had been skipped or skimped on to the point of hurting the flow of the movie.  Too often, the makers of movies get trapped in the prescribed formulaic methods they are told are required for audience enjoyment.  In doing so, the skips and skimps become overused.     I am convinced that is what weakened this latest movie.  Trying to fit an elaborate story into a specific time frame isn't a necessity!  Adding a few minutes to each key scene to help flesh out the storyline can make it a vastly improved work.  The \\"Lord of the Rings\\" trilogy proved that audience members can take it!     On a brighter note, I think these movies are still on the upper half of the ratings scale I use to judge the quality of my movies.  On a scale of 1 (meaning STINK-O, RUN AWAY!) and 10 (meaning WATCH FIVE TIMES IN A ROW WITHOUT MOVING) I'd give \\"Indiana Jones and the Kingdom of the Crystal Skull\\" a 6.  Definately worth watching once, but not worth purchasing unless you are a collector.     Thanks for reading!
B001ED7C58|3.0|The music soundtrack isn't that bad I've heard. Rob's song pretty good with the exception of almost sounding like Jessica Simpson where you couldn't understand the words.. But Good!...

1416594884|1.0|I thought that this book was so caught up in nifty nuance it lacked focus, drama, momentum and excitement. I kept waiting to be enagaged and enthralled and found myself, instead, scratching my head, bewildered by the one-dimensional, lugubrious plot.     I found no chapter propulsion nor suspense. I kept putting it down and labored to pick it up.    It lacked insight, metaphor, conceits, turn-of-phrase (but for a 60-year old man, Brue, looking for the dignity of love)or interest.    Disappointing.

0765356139|5.0|It's rare that a series -- and it's always trilogies in fantasy, isn't it? -- gets better after a good first volume. That, however, is exactly what Brandon Sanderson has been able to pull off with his Mistborn/Hero of the Ages series. The first book was outstanding, with a compelling, innovative magic system, interesting characters, and a refreshingly original story. The Well of Ascension, which I finished a few weeks ago, picked up right where #1 left off and improved on the story by adding new characters, fleshing out some of the secondary characters and themes from the first, and moving the story along in a direction that was both plausible, within the world Sanderson's world, and yet not at all predictable.    I'm reading the third book, Hero of the Ages, now and there has been no 'point of dimishing marginal returns' as of yet -- he's definitely sprinting through the finish line. Read this book if you read the first; read the first one if this on interests you, and work your way into Hero of the Ages.

B0013BNY2Q|3.0|Accelerate can be one of those albums which fans, upset with R.E.M.'s last few releases, may judge too highly, throwing out words like comeback just to describe a vague adult-rock, easy going consistency in a way which almost insults some of their finer intricacies.
B00004TVGF|5.0|Listening to this music, and especially this version, brings me back to the very essence of music with a minimal instrumentation which is very well balanced with excellent voices.  Once you have heard this boy soprano you risk never ever want to hear a female soprano (for this work at least) again.  Cristalline purity, extreme height and extreme stability, so without the female vibrato at the top end and going higher than a woman altogether.  One prerequisite though, your audio equipment needs to be of the best of standards to be able to fully reproduce the boy soprano!  Excellent conducting and singing by Jacobs as well who turns out a very good counterbalance for Hennig.  A pitty the performance was edited on the cheaper line of Harmonia Mundi.  I guess because the quality of recording has some flaws which are quickly forgotten once you are absorbed by the music.  Am looking forward for a re-editing of this recording to nowadays standards.  I have two more CD's of this performance in reserve just in case my one reference CD gets broken at a certain moment in time... think this says it all.
0930289234|5.0|This book is just all around amazing. It has so many real life issues that many people can relate to all tied to a plot taking place in 85 where Nixon is still president and the Russians are trying to invade its surrounding enemies. Not to mention the \\"Watchmen\\". Ordinary people dressing up in costumes to bash \\"evil\\". There is one super-hero in this book and it is by accident. If you love graphic novels or you are considering picking one up for the first time this one is a great start.<br />Not to mention they are making a movie based on the Watchmen that comes out 03/06/09. There are twists at every turn of the page and the writing is brilliant. The images are iconic for its time. Pick this up and delve right into Watchmen.
B00008BXJ6|4.0|The first American release from the sneering and swaggering AC/DC was a torn together pastiche of two Australian albums with a new cover, but that doesn't stop \\"High Voltage\\" from giving serious zap power. AC/Dc had already figured out exactly what route ([[ASIN:B000002JS8 Highway to Hell]], maybe) they were taking and began to blast their way to the top. Even with the heavy dose of filler that's on this CD, there's still no way to deny the visceral force of the best songs here.<br /><br />There's the statement of purpose in \\"It's a Long Way To The Top,\\" the rock- as-street-gang chant with \\"TNT\\" and the dirty joke as blues number when Bon Scott sneers \\"She got The Jack.\\" Behind it all is Angus Young's volume blasting but deceptively dexterous guitars and one of rock's best rhythm keepers, drummer Phil Rudd. (Bassist Mark Evans would split by the time [[ASIN:B00008WT5C Let There Be Rock]] came out.) Above the fray, Scott wailed like a banshee thug, becoming one of those rare rock singers who didn't just overwhelm, he actually seemed like a true threat to the mortals of society. It made the standout tracks hit with such brute force that \\"High Voltage\\" was impossible to ignore.<br /><br />\\"High Voltage\\" did suffer from the filer tracks and (like the early [[ASIN:B000001EKV Kiss]] albums) non-beefy production. However, the band improved past the juvenile postures fast. By the time they hit [[ASIN:B00008WT5E Powerage]], AC/DC had mastered their outrageous power and were cutting classic albums. And much like Kiss, AC/DC were Hell-Bent on world domination, making no bones about the fact that they were going to be rock-stars, and you'd better stay out of their way.

B0012EM5D8|4.0|Oftentimes, progressive messages are contained within movies and books for children.  The Bee Movie is no exception.  There are several messages regarding the rights of labor, fairness, animal rights and so forth.  While the corporate media often filters out progressive messages [[ASIN:B00005Y726 Manufacturing Consent - Noam Chomsky and the Media]], there are people within the system that are creating space for messages that our children will benefit from hearing.  The Bee Movie provides many moments that encourage critical thought about our economic system, the conditions of our work [[ASIN:046505434X The Overworked American: The Unexpected Decline Of Leisure]], and our relations with non-human species [[ASIN:B000UR9TJQ I Am an Animal: The Story of Ingrid Newkirk and PETA]].

As adults, it's our responsibility to encourage children to think critically, and this movie is one resource to do that.  It also is just a beautifully crafted film.

B000003TAL|5.0|This is a great album. It is one of my favorite Sonic Youth albums. Unlike a lot of their albums this one is not so experimental in sound, and is easier to listen to. If you have a Sonic Youth itch and you are not sure which album to start with this one is a good choice.

B001BPJJ82|5.0|Fascinating, endearing, stunning. Beautiful opening title sequence, exceptional cinematography and locations.    Roy's patience and gentleness helped Alexandria's big heart blossom before us on screen, there inturn healing and propagating the subsequent opening of Roy's own wounded heart. Each of them became each other's hero.    Despite their age difference the convergence and divergence in the vision of their story exemplifies how in our own minds communication and collaboration between people can be interpreted both so similarly and dissimilarly and yet still be woven together.     The commentaries on how the film was shot, constructed and its evolution were fascinating showing genuine innovation: Lee Pace and Catinca's first meeting essentially shot \\"live\\" and Lee's separate \\"live\\" performance to cast and crew regarding his ailment are examples of how this story within a story further blurs the boundary of what is real, or natural, with that of a story. Brilliant.    The musical score: Haunting and addictive.     Definitely Oscar material.    While completely original and unique, subtle nuances in \\"The Fall\\" evoke elements in two other great films: \\"The Wizard of Oz\\" and \\"Once Upon a Time in the West\\".     \\"The Fall\\", I am certain, will be studied by film students in years to come alongside those made by Fellini, Sergio Leone and other Greats.    Sidenote: The recurring presence of oranges in the film signifies their importance in that era of Los Angeles especially in hospitals: Much of the orange crop in that era was purchased by the government for the wellness and benefit of patients, causing orange shortages and high orange prices for the rest of America.

B001ED7C58|3.0|I give this soundtrack 3 stars simply because each individual song on the playlist is either 4 to 5-star material or 1 to 2-star material in the final analysis.<br /><br />Let's consider the 5-star category:<br />-Full Moon<br />-Supermassive Black Hole<br />-Leave out all the Rest<br />-Decode<br />-Never Think<br />-Flightless Bird<br />-Eyes on Fire<br />All of these 7 songs convey (at least to me) the essence of the Twilight story: the angst, the emo, the otherworldly nature of the Cullens, the longing, the all-out creep factor of the trackers, the bittersweet love of Bella and Edward.  In particular, I was quite taken with Full Moon by The Black Ghosts.  This song is pure, distilled Twilight.  Flightless Bird, by Iron & Wine, was suggested by Kristen Stewart, and I thank her for it.  It provided a nice contrast to Supermassive Black Hole by Muse, which is really rockin.  Pattinson's song, Never Think, is one that will either be enjoyed (I did) or hated, but I think it's a good addition and captures the soulfullness of Edward's character.  I understand that Paramore wrote Decode especially for Twilight, and it shows.  It's a stong addition to the track.  Linkin Park is Linkin Park - love 'em or hate 'em, and Leave out all the Rest has what it takes to make it to the soundtrack (looking forward to seeing where it goes in the movie).<br /><br />Now to the 1-stars:<br />Go All the Way<br />Tremble for my Beloved<br />I Caught Myself<br />Spotlight<br />Bella's lullaby<br /><br />I have to say that out of the entire soundtrack, Go all the Way (Perry Farrel) must be the worse.  How this one made it in over so many better songs defies logic.  Just bad.  Starts off like some cheesey 80's movie music.  While I liked Paramore's Decode, they should have kept them to one song- I Caught Myself added nothing to the track, and it's spot should have gone to another band.<br />Bella's Lullaby was always going to be a bone of contention for most listeners.  I think all of us have our own idea of what it should sound like, and there's been enough Youtube videos featuring hundreds of alternative \\"lullabys\\" so that we were already biased on one before the final \\"reveal\\".  Carter Burwell wasn't going to win this one in my opinion.  His take on the lullaby was much to simplistic, and the addition of the orchestral elements was strange to say the least.

0312427999|5.0|This is highly recommended to read about the damage caused by the \\"Chicago School\\" of economics.  Theories pushed by Milton Friedman and his school were used by the CIA as justification for overthrowing democratically elected governments in favor of right wing dictatorships in several Latin American countries.  There was blood on the hands of Nobel Prize winner Friedman but he managed to disassociate himself from the violence through a strange process of ratiocination.  A valuable book that everyone should read.
B000001YOW|3.0|I won't deny Porcupine Tree has some talent, and at least the early albums have a dreamy atmosphere to help the music sound a *little* better than the recent hard rock stuff (which I definitely don't see the appeal of) but there's some noticeable problems with Signify that bother me as well.      Let me mention the things I like about the album first.  The pretty and dreamy vibe that dominates the entire album.  It's an atomsphere that puts you in a state of ease, and makes you feel calm and relaxed.  I like this.  It's something I felt the new albums were lacking severely.  Also, I love the guitar solos that can be heard in some of the songs.  In fact, the instrumental passages are rather good most of the time.    The problem I have is that some of the musical ideas repeat a bit too much for me, and the songwriting isn't nearly as great as many fans will have you believe.  One song includes a flute that repeats the same notes a few extra times than necessary.  Sometimes these guys don't know exactly when to stop hanging on to the same musical ideas and switch to something else, because that's the main thing that keeps me interested in prog rock.     Also, there's a couple moments where you can hear some talking, instead of singing, and that's totally cheesy and unacceptable.     These guys were clearly influenced by the likes of Pink Floyd and early King Crimson, without having the amazing songwriting abilities of either band IMO.  I guess if you like \\"Comfortably Numb\\", the Pink Floyd classic, you'll love this album.  But then again, why bother with bands like this when you can hear more talented and influential bands such as Pink Floyd?

B001C4AFP8|4.0|Less pedantic than \\"Lions for Lambs,\\" but more pulpy than \\"Rendition\\" or \\"Stop-Loss,\\" \\"Body of Lies\\" is Hollywood's latest endeavor to bring the war-on-terror to the silver screen.<br /><br />Leonardo DiCaprio plays an undercover CIA operative working in the explosive Middle East under the guiding hand of Russell Crowe, his ruthless, acerbic boss who feeds him instructions straight from his cushy office at Langley Headquarters.  Despite their double billing, DiCaprio and Crowe rarely appear on screen together, making DiCaprio the default star of the picture.  He gives one of his finest performances as a man thoroughly dedicated to the cause he is fighting for but deeply cognizant of the fact that much of what he is required to do in the course of his job will wind up robbing him of a certain percentage of his humanity after all is said and done.  Crowe as the cynical boss and, even more impressively, Mark Strong as a high official in the Jordanian government offer superlative support.<br /><br />As directed by Ridley Scott (from a screenplay by William Monahan based on a novel by David Ignatius), \\"Body of Lies\\" benefits from engaging dialogue, exciting action sequences and razor-sharp editing.  The movie is long (128 minutes) but rarely uninteresting, and DiCaprio makes us care deeply about his character.<br /><br />It may not be the \\"deepest\\" of the war-on-terror movies, but it's certainly one of the most watchable.
B001GQSY5U|5.0|I thought this was a fantastic introduction to the new animated Clone Wars Cartoon.  I thought characters were developed extremely well.  We got to see something from Anikin besides the \\"I'm not understood\\" teenager, whose potential is being wasted.<br /><br />We got to see a Star Wars movie that was not defined by special effects, instead focuses on story and characters.  It also level set expectations for the new series.  Remember folks, the new series is playing on the \\"Cartoon Network\\"...go figure it is aimed at kids.  However, I felt they left plenty for adults without insulting us with sickly infantile characters like Jar-Jar.<br /><br />Ahsoka acted like a teenager, because she was.  Anikin responded in kind because he was not particularly well developed emotionally (remember, this is the guy who turned into the evil leader of the universe...that does not happen to stable people).<br /><br />I have added this movie to my collection so I can see it a couple of times and to show my support for the Clone Wars series.  It will probably not be my most watched movie in my collection (like We Were Soldiers), but my son (12 year old) and I (43 year old) will enjoy watching it together a couple of times and he will probably watch it until the plastic melts...
B000Y7ZHCU|5.0|Loved the concert! I would never have been able to afford to attend her show in Vegas, but the DVD is the next best thing to being there. I would recommend this dvd to any and all that love great music as well as beautiful visuals.    Go Celine and team. You've put a wonderful concert dvd together. Thank You!
B000002OX7|5.0|I will be short on this. I am old enough to have seen The Who five times live, with the original greats and at their peak. Mostly at the Fillmore East in NYC. As much as I loved them as the best live performers I have ever experienced, I appreciate their genius more now. No Fireworks, makeup, no stage props, just the explosion of their energy and talent.   They put the B in Band, as they were truly the sum of their totally unique, individual parts.   Who's Next is simply the Greatest Rock Album ever made by the Greatest Rock Group ever assembled. Listen to every part of this, Moons incredible bass, Entwhistle's Bass, Daltry's singing and song interpretations and the guitar, arrangements, songwriting and lyrics by their creative force, Pete Townshend. Of course Baba O'Reilly and \\"Won't Get Fooled Again are not songs anymore, they have become ANTHEMS !! Check out the reaction of the cops and firefighters at the concert for 9/11 in New York, when the Who are playing. I am an ex New Yorker and it really brought me to tears, I knew what they were feeling as \\"Anthems\\", The Who were playing let them release their energy in some magical moments. Nothing to do with Who's Next, but Ringo's son Zack, the current drummer for The Who is fantastic.     Each of the musicians changed the way their instrument can be played. I can't really say that Moon and Entwhistle was a rhythm section, for sometimes Townshend was the rhythm section, with those power chords of his and their might be a lead Bass or even lead Drums in the song.   There is nothing even close to a weak part of this masterpiece.     The best from the best.    Jon
0132350882|4.0|The book contains much useful advice for professional programmers. A bunch of software authors have contributed the book's chapters.<br /><br />There is one place where I disagree. Where it talks about having commented out code in your source code file. Yes, this often leads to obsolete code, even as commented out code, precisely because as you change various things like variables in the active code, this has no effect on the commented out portions. The book recommends that you simply delete the latter, since you can always retrieve it later via your version control system, which you should certainly be using anyway.<br /><br />But the book's reasoning is flawed. Simply having the commented out code stored in the version control system is of little use. Out of sight, out of mind. How many programmers are actually going to troll thru previous versions of the file looking for that particular code? For one thing, they have to somehow know or suspect that it might exist. If the programmer currently working on the file is not the author of the commented out code, then there is little likelihood that she will even be aware of this. But even if she was the author of the original code, what if she forgets?<br /><br />The book's recommendation is an idealisation. The pragmatic reality is that you should, sparingly, keep commented out code in your source files, precisely because it is there in front of you, retaining mindshare, whenever you edit the file. I say sparingly, because you should only do this for crucial code blocks. How to determine this? Well, that is part of your expert knowledge.
B0000E6XH3|5.0|I don't suppose anybody knows if the 1.33:1 screen aspect ratio is the original production format???  I assume that it is since i can't find it in a widescreen version anywhere.<br /><br />In other news... this movie is saweeeet!  =)
B001GAPC1K|5.0|I can';t say how happy I was when I found out they had cast Robert Downey Jr. for this role.  He was the best choice I think they could have made to play Tony Stark, and the movie benefits greatly from his presence.  I am a big fan of the comic series and was also happy to find that this was one of the better ones made, so far.
0205313426|5.0|Strunk and Whites Elements of style deals with the slippery and vague elements of the English language; turns them around and upside down and then puts them in the right place, never to be forgotten again.<br />Your Strunk and White is a tool, one and a quarter inch thick, five and a quarter inch wide and eight and a quarter inch long or 1.5 x 13.5 x 21 cm. How do you write a date, the one on the calendar, when should you use a colon, the double dotted one, or a comma? Strunk and White will take away your doubts and set you on solid ground. It's even entertaining reading if you have nothing else to do. Highly recommended.
1401201911|5.0|I thought that The Red Son would be this sort of cool elseworld take on Superman and I will get around to it when I feel like it. Then I read it and I wished I had picked it up sooner. It has taken a place on my self reserved for my favorites.<br /><br />I really liked the use of Batman, Green Lantern, Bizarro, and Brainiac in this story as well as the lack of kryptonite. I have always considered it pretty gay that some douche always is taking Superman out with a little green rock. Not here though. I liked how differently every enemy was formed and took on Superman. Batman was my favorite enemy of the state of all time and I think a story line like with Batman like this should be written.<br /><br />The ending for me is what really made this story stand alone. It was clever and something that made me shout, \\"AWESOME!!!\\" then my girlfriend elbowed me for waking her up. Just a well told story. Enjoy.
006051048X|4.0|The CD was an excellent addition to my classroom library.  I was reading the novel with a group of my struggling readers, so to have the audio (read by the author with his English accent!) was a great bonus.  It really helped my students get inside the book and the characters.  The enjoyed hearing the voices of the rats, the mice and other interesting characters in the novel.
B000TJBNFI|4.0|This is one of best movies made from a Stephen King book.  Katy Bates is great (also is great in Deloris Clabourne)and so is James Caan.  Where are all disappointed when a long running series is over, but this is taking it to a whole new level.
B001BPJJ82|5.0|a really beautifully shot movie with a beautiful story. the little girl has an incredible, natural performance, and some of the optical illusions of scenes are dazzling.
143911000X|5.0|This book isn't some quick, half-hearted cash-in for How I Met Your Mother Fans, it's basically Barney Stinson in paperback form. The Bro Code is hilarious. If you're a fan of the show you'll likely hear Neil Patrick Harris' voice in your head as you read the book cover-to-cover. With diagrams, footnotes, and over 150 \\"codes\\" written by the show's writers, this is a can't miss book.

B000002J09|5.0|It's amazing to me how the kids react to the music which is the foundation of their own. The younger generations just don't get it. If you place this music in the context and period which is was created then you may understand the greatness of this record. It still shines today as being innovative and provocative. These guys invented heavy metal. Their would be no mosh pits hadn't it been for Led Zeppelin. Youngsters, keep listening so that your ears may evolve beyond the barrage of marketing tactics of today which have you all in the pockets of capitalists.
B001CLG6RC|5.0|Very fast delivey to Great Britian.  Well packaged and as described.  Many thanks for your custom.
B001GKJ2E8|5.0|I don't watch enough action flicks to compare this to as far as 'depth' is concerned (and I find people looking for 'depth' in action movies about as silly/clueless as these movies are accused of being). But as I understand it, Wanted is based on a comic book (so judge the movie accordingly, please, instead of out of context). Morgan Freeman, Angelina Jolie, and James McAvoy and the rest truly impressed in their respective roles. And Ms. Jolie (or Mrs. Pitt) burnt a hole on the screen with her physicality (clearly she's no damsel-in-distress) and her deep brooding enigmatic charm. Her best action role to date: as Fox she could kick Ms. Lara Croft's sorry 4$$ without breaking a sweat. I saw it twice on the big screen and intend to get the DVD (saying quite a lot since I'm not really an action movie fan).
B001ED7C58|5.0|I think overall the soundtrack is great.  I am happy with my purchase. The only song I can't stand to listen to is \\"Go All The Way\\" by Perry Farrell.  The lyrics are beyond Cheesy making it painful for me to listen to. I DID listen to it all the way through a few times trying to be objective about it but...ooh the cheese!  It has a nice beat but that's all the praise I have for it.  Bella's lullaby is pretty. Not what I expected, but it's still beautiful to listen to.  Now last but not least Rob Pattinson's song...I really like it, the melody is great and he has a good soothing voice.  I just wish I could understand what he is saying.  Is it just me or is everyone else having a problem deciphering it? Maybe I need my ears cleaned!

0670019925|5.0|As many of the dust-jacket blurbs note, in _Deaf Sentence_ David Lodge gives a pitch-perfect description of the frustrations and embarrassments of being hard of hearing.  His look at deafness goes deeper, however, revealing its heavy personal toll on relationships, be it in the simple irritation that chafes from day to day with a spouse, or in the lingering difficulty of attempting to enrich--without the aid of good communication--already distant relationships with grown children or an ailing father.  Lodge's characters and situations are none too fresh--an retired linguistics (read English) professor worries over the academic and sexual interest of a young blonde graduate student--but what he does with them is riveting and, eventually, life affirming.  By turns funny, wry, cynical and touching, _Deaf Sentence_ proves a wonderful read for most anyone, not simply those who know someone who is hearing impaired.
B000MZHW40|3.0|This movie was very well put together for what it is. It is almost a docudrama about present day Africa, exploitation of Africans by each other as much as anyone, and the diamond trade.    I have two problems with the movie. First, it was not entertaining to me. It was a too violent depiction of real life and, overall, it did not reflect much hope. Second, I found Leonardo's character's eventual compassion too little and too late to believe.    This movie was highly recommended to me by several people. I guess it just is not my cup of tea.
0307269191|4.0|For those of us who love Murakami and harbor the desire to get to know the guy, _Running_ is sure to disappoint.  He admits to being cold and distant--not a nice guy after all.  And the mystery of the way he lives his life?  Discipline, schedule, diet, and exercise.  It's not exactly the cool Murakami I expected, but this book is full of inadvertently and reluctantly delivered sage wisdom.  A good read if you run, and an excellent read if you write.
B001EN71DG|1.0|I grew up loving Star Wars, and then when it was FINALLY released on DVD, I was highly disappointed, because the editions were the poorly bastardized versions that Mr. Lucas keeps putting out.    This edition is the same.  If you want a newly styled package, this is the set for you.  Otherwise, BOYCOTT George Lucas and his lust for money, and DO NOT BUY THIS ITEM.      Wait for Lucas Films to remaster (not REDO) the original-original movies, and put them on DVD.  No more revising of history -
B001GKJ2DO|5.0|I also loved this movie and saw it several times. I too wonder sometimes if the critics and I saw the same film. Mamma Mia! made me feel happy, and like other reviewers here, I was bopping along with the music. I've rarely seen such chemistry in a cast, and they truly looked like they were having a ball! (If this cast was faking that, they should all get Oscars.) Pierce Brosnan might not have the greatest singing voice, but his acting was superb. And who knew that Colin Firth could sing so well! But it was Meryl Streep's \\"The Winner Takes It All\\" that gave me goosebumps. My friends and I will all be buying Mamma Mia! when it is released.
0307346617|5.0|At first I was doubtful that a zombie novel would be better than classic fliks.  Man am I surprised, this is the real Zombie $#!T.  I don't think a Zombie movie has ever captured the worldwide effect of a Zombie attack as good as this book.  The story is set in the present depicting real places, real historical moments making it believable.  Makes you wonder what would happen if this really happened.  Great book and hope to find more from the author.  Recommended for any Zombie fan.

0385340990|5.0|Between January 8 and September 17, 1946 (the period of Juliet Ashton's letters in this delightful book) I came home from months of World War II combat suffering what I recognized years later as a mild form of PTSD. After some down time, GI Bill enrollment at the University of Denver, a far-away, improbable choice, set my life on a course that changed it forever. It was due to a chance encounter in a drugstore. Here, Juliet Ashton, a London writer seeking a new project, finds it on the island of Guernsey, through a letter from a resident who implausibly came across her name on the flyleaf of a book. These seemingly small, random events so often rule our lives.<br /><br />Fiction merged with reality when I picked up this book from my wife's reading table and started perusing its timeline and relevance to my own experience. After a few pages I was captured. It was due in part to the beautiful writing exemplified in the letters. But more than that it was Juliet Ashton. I was again in postwar England and madly, if virtually, in love. Only the best fiction can do that. Juliet is smart, giddy, serious, bubbly, bookish, witty, outgoing, introspective, teasing, seeking, longing, flirtatious, and precisely focused. It is doubtful if such a near-perfect woman actually exists. But that matters little when good fiction makes us laugh and cry and tune our senses to the joys of life and what truly matters.<br /><br />When Juliet goes to Guernsey to write a book about the German occupation and meets the characters of the literary and potato peel society, itself formed by a quirky random event, we go with her. Through the letters she writes and receives we meet the worldly publisher with whom she is half in love but cannot marry because of an irrevocable impediment. We get to know her best friend and confidant from childhood, meet the imprudent American who both fascinates and repels her, and the many characters on Guernsey who give the story its gist and charm. And we are embedded in her soul as she schemes and plots her own life while going through the process of constructing a novel and finding its proper center. That turns out to be a tragic love story between a German officer and a spirited English girl much like Juliet. In this sense it is a book about writing and its enticing agonies and ecstasies.<br /><br />Sadly, though, the book has a flaw. Near the end it departs from its letters format and hastens the plot through something called detection notes of one of the literary club members. That abruptly changes the mood. From then on the story seems cut off prematurely (or perhaps I just never wanted it to end) when it might have proceeded more slowly through the grace of the letters form. This is a minor quibble but it illustrates an important point: It is too bad that the age of letter writing has given way to the immediate urgencies of email and text messaging. Time, distance, and reflective thought are essential ingredients of good writing, particularly that which reaches into the lavish depths of the mind, heart, and soul. Letters, of the old-fashioned kind, provided that. The great charm of this book is that for a few hours we can revel in it again.s she schemes and plots her own life while going through the process of constructing a novel and finding its proper center.

B001BKXUOQ|5.0|It's been way too long since the last Slipknot album. This one is no disappointment, there are a few kind of slow songs that remind me of Stonesour but the heavy songs are sick. A must have.
B00138KJY0|5.0|I think with all of the negative stuff with Michael (As One reviewer put it) We forgot how talented he really is. But with all the hype of today's music, we simply forgot the ingredients for a classic album. When A song has a minimum of 6 tracks that everyone can love, that album is deemed great. And this album does Just that. The funny part is sometimes you will be listening to the radio and hear a song and find out \\"Wow, that was on Off The Wall?\\" The Album had the perfect blend of Song writers, producers, and talented people behind it. No ego's no issues just pure music. When You ever get that into a recording studio, you will get another \\"Off The Wall\\" This album should go down as one of the Best Albums Period\\"

B001AIRUP4|5.0|This is one of mine and my wifes favorite movies, so we were glad to see it released on bluray. The video quality is very good. We were amazed that we were able to see details and quality that are nearly invisible on the dvd version. I would highly recommend this one to everyone!
B000YDAYHC|5.0|Great boots.  They look good, esp. with jeans.  They are considerably lighter than most Timberland boots----the sole is thinner and the interior doesn't have the usual thick lining.  But the quality is still there and they are very comfortable.    Timberlands always run big on me, so I buy a half size smaller than my true size.
0385340990|4.0|This book is witty and engaging and I realize how lucky I am that these evil times have never come close to my home. The letter to letter dialog is a clever way to telling the narrative and makes me miss the fun I used to get at the mailbox. Who writes letters anymore when you can email? Definitely worth a read.
B00187MXNQ|4.0|Yes, William up above maybe hit it spot on about there possibly not being a market in the US for this. It is more like the Brit orchestrated psych in '66 to '68, as heard on comps now like Chocolate Soup For Diabetics that feature bands such as Tintern Alley or the Insane Times compilation. Brit stuff did not sound much like American. I didn't care for most of it I've heard, but I do appreciate these guys and the authentic sound they've reconstructed.
0684823454|5.0|This is a fascinating account of Churchill's life up to about 1904, written around 1930.  Even if you are not interested in Churchill (hard for me to imaging if you are reading this review) just the perspective into the late Victorian era is worth the price of admission.  It was a totally different world.
B000AP04OM|4.0|This was a brand new movie & was fun to watch. It was worth every penny!
B000GLKLCK|5.0|I have listened to the dozen cds in this set multiple times and keep coming back to them. I have also read the other reviewers of this set and agree with all of the super positive ones. Mozart fans -This is the one to buy.
B000UNYJXQ|5.0|Have been a fan of Michael Moore for a long time.  This is one of his best works.  We have a serious health care problem in America and he brings out the ugly truth in a humorous and thoughtful way. As one of the most developed countries in the world we should be ashamed we do not have universal health care.
0515127485|5.0|I saw the film which was made from this book last evening.  It was good, and I enjoyed it.  However, I have to say it was a bit disappointing in that it didn't have the emotional snap that the writing of Robert Harris does.<br /><br />See the film if you like, but be sure to read the book.  It is another Harris masterpiece of intrigue and mystery as are his \\"Fatherland\\" and \\"Enigma\\".  Wonderful stories woven around fairly recent historical events and characters.  Great writing and reading; you won't be able to put it down.
B001GKJ2FW|5.0|I loved this film.  The ultimate \\"chick flick\\"! I actually saw it twice in the theater.  It is a great movie to see with your girlfriends or your mom.  It's one of those movies that just begs to be shared.  You end the movie just feeling happy and the music of Abba is, of course, catchy.  Meryl Streep was amazing and blew me away.  I had no idea she could sing like that.  Not all the actors could sing well, but it didn't take away from the movie for me.
B000085RTX|5.0|Amazing album, amazing band. One of the best American metal bands that most people don't know!!!
0930289234|5.0|The characters are remarkable, the story lines are unforgettable, the artwork and images are iconic and the overwhelming message that is so relivent even today is something that will be burned into your mind long after you read it. I like picking it up every once in a while and rereading certain pages. Its inspiring.
B0016Q2D5M|3.0|Journey to the Center of the Earth is a good action flick for the family but otherwise this film is pretty average. Brendan Fraser always plays the smart but dimwitted guy, his facial expressions say it all. Josh Hutcherson is a great younger actor, he actually carries this movie instead of Fraser. The action and special effects are excellent but the storyline is rather mundane, it's a mixed bag for me.
B0006Z2KYI|5.0|I came to this film late, mostly as a curiosity having watched the Mel Brooks remake many times.<br /><br />Boy am I glad I finally caught this.  This film provides a rare window on the early days of the war, as seen by a Western Europe equally perplexed and disgusted by the rise of Nazism.  In the hands of a brilliant director, and a motivated cast, this film transcends its moment and enters the realm of high art.<br /><br />I could go on about the sets, the intricate comic plot that grows increasingly absurd, the luminous Carol Lombard and her amazing gowns, the always funny Jack Benny hamming it and serving as the butt of many jokes, the great character actors populating the cast as real and fake Nazis, or even an early fine performance by Robert Stack, but I'll simply urge you to see this film and see for yourself.<br /><br />Given the trajectory of the war, both for Poles, Jews, and even for many Germans, this film was prescient and really is one of a kind.
B0013ND30W|5.0|I have always loved this movie and was so excited for it to come out on Blu-Ray.  Kids can really run down a movie by watching it over an over again so I am glad I won't have that problem with this disc.  It's such a great movie.
B000HEWEDK|5.0|Forbidden Planet was always a science fiction favorite of mine due to it's outlandish setting, great acting, great sets, great characters, excellent science fiction and human element.  It's pretty much everything good science fiction should be but too seldom actually achieves: intellectually stimulating, frightening, sexy, bold in story and look, fantastic, etc.  This 2006 remastering is stunningly beautiful even on a standard DVD.  Someone kept or found an excellent print or negative which is very fortunate.<br /><br />So in this Forbidden Planet DVD we have arguably the most significant science fiction film of the surrounding decades beautifully restored to probably better than it's ever been seen in a theater.  Kudos to the makers and restorers of this classic.<br /><br />For those who haven't seen Forbidden Planet, it's been likened to Shakespeare's Tempest set in space, but it has interesting plot twists of its own.  This film significantly influenced every movie or television series set on a spaceship, particularly Star Trek which followed about a decade later.<br /><br />The extras include deleted scenes which were rightfully deleted.  Those scenes edited out, the theatrical release is much tighter, if one can forgive the ugly jump cuts that result.<br /><br />I highly recommend this science fiction classic, especially for the wonderful remastering.
B000H6SXMY|5.0|I am very happy with the product and it will remain as one of my best purchases. It comes in a beautiful cover and with good documentation.    To bring it in Kuwait, I had to pay additional 19$ to the courier company, as handling charges for Customs (Ministry of Interior).    Cheers.
B001ECQ6YW|4.0|Po is a panda who works at his family's noodle shop with dreams of doing kung-fu alongside The Furious Five(a legendary five that is comprised of Tigress (Angelina Jolie), Crane (David Cross), Praying Mantis (Seth Rogen), Viper (Lucy Liu) and Monkey (Jackie Chan)). Po is afraid to share his desire with his father who wants him to take over the restaurant when he retires. Everything changes one day when Master Oogway (Randall Duk Kim) has a premonition about Tai Lung (Ian McShane), a former prot&eacute;g&eacute; of his who's gone bad. He fears Tai Lung will escape from prison and come back to the region for revenge. In accordance with prophecy, Oogway stages a ceremony to name a Dragon Warrior to defend the kingdom. He is supposed to pick from among the Furious Five, but error leads to his picking Po. It is left up to Shifu, kung fu master, to teach Po what he needs to defeat Tai Lung but will he be able to in time? That's pretty much what this movie is all about.<br /><br />In my honest opinion, Kung Fu Panda is awesome. It's even more entertaining than any recent CGI movie I've seen on DVD recently. Given, the movie is played a little more seriously with laces of humor throughout, it is definitely a movie the whole family will enjoy.<br /><br />Special Features include: Directors' Commentary, \\"Meet the Cast\\" (13:00)- The cast recording the audio for the film,  \\"Pushing the Boundaries\\" (7:00) - The computer animation and the creation of the characters,  \\"Sound Design\\" (4:00) - The creation of the sound for the film,  Music Video of Cee-Lo singing \\"Kung Fu Fighting\\",  \\"Mr. Ping's Noodle House\\" (4:00) - The Food Network's Alton Brown goes to Mr. Chow's in L.A. to see how they make noodles,  \\"How to Use Chopsticks\\" (3:00) - Instructional video,  \\"Conservation International: Help Save Wild Pandas\\" (3:00) - Jack Black talking about the importance of saving pandas, \\"Dragon Warrior Training Academy\\" - Game played with the remote.<br /><br />All in all, Kung Fu Panda is a movie that the whole family will enjoy watching over and over again. Definitely recommended.oy watching over and over again. Definitely recommended.
0790729628|1.0|99% of the time when I buy a \\"Directors Cut\\", the movie is improved and usually the added footage makes it more enjoyable if you are a big fan of the movie anyway.  This is a completely different movie.  It's funny; the one thing in the original movie that has been copied in countless movies is the narrative \\"feel\\", and this has been removed in the directors cut.  I am going to try to sell this because I will never watch it again.
B00003CXCW|5.0|This is one of those classics that deserves its reputation and then some.  It's one of the best films ever made about Hollywood, and it doesn't have a trace of \\"inside\\" jokes or condenscenion as a lot of films/TV shows about Hollywood do today.  The story starts out in startling fashion as a dead William Holden is narrating from the grave (you see his body in a pool in the famous opening scene, then they flashback).  Holden is a down on his luck screenwriter who stumbles across Norma Desmond (played by Gloria Swanson), a former silent screen star who lives with her trusted butler (played by the great filmmaker Erich von Stroheim).  She has delusions of a comeback, and he assists her by shaping her screenplay about Salome.  Holden finds the script hopelessly self indulgent, but he needs the cash, so he agrees.<br /><br />The film is startling in many ways.  It's a cynical, hard boiled film (close to film noir), but it isn't heartless, as many think it is.  It has some of the greatest lines in movie history, and some startling scenes, such as the opening and the scene where Desmond mistakes Holden for the caretaker who has come to bury her dead monkey (the shot of the monkey is very creepy and unsettling, even today).  It has some of the greatest performances in any film.  Holden is terrific as the screenwriter just trying to survive, Swanson is astounding as Norma Desmond, the still alluring yet terrifying former screen star, and Erich von Stroheim is wonderful as Max, the faithful butler.  The mansion in which Desmond lives looks like it was out of a Von Stroheim film from the 1920's (this may have been intentional), perhaps even emulating Von Stroheim's last film, Queen Kelly (which starred Gloria), as well.  Cecil B. DeMille himself shows up playing himself, and he has some of the best scenes.  He comes across as warm and humanistic, and his sadness feels very real.  One of the most remarkable and poignant scenes in the film is when a gaffer recognizes Norma Desmond, she acknowledges him, and he puts the spotlight on her.  Everyone on the film that DeMille is shooting recognize her, and they flock to her with admiration and love.  It's a beautiful moment, perfectly realised, and it shows while Billy Wilder may have been a cynical [...], he wasn't a complete, heartless [...].<br /><br />The film has hardly dated at all (most of Wilder's work hasn't), and its cynicism, intelligence, and depth still sear the screen like no other film on Hollywood.  This is arguably the best film ever made about Tinseltown.  There have been many films on Hollywood (Altman's The Player is one of the best examples, but sometimes that's a bit too much inside), but this one remains the best.he acknowledges him, and he puts the spotlight on her.  Everyone on the film that DeMille is shooting recognize her, and they flock to her with admiration and love.  It's a beautiful moment, perfectly realised, and it shows while Billy Wilder may have been a cynical [...], he wasn't a complete, heartless [...].      The film has hardly dated at all (most of Wilder's work hasn't), and its cynicism, intelligence, and depth still sear the screen like no other film on Hollywood.  This is arguably the best film ever made about Tinseltown.  There have been many films on Hollywood (Altman's The Player is one of the best examples, but sometimes that's a bit too much inside), but this one remains the best.
1591841992|4.0|Business diagrams are too often complex, difficult to understand and even harder to explain. The Back of the Napkin contains instruction and useful examples of how to get your message across simply and effectively.    As a Business Process and Management Reporting Consultant, I have been recommending this book this year to the business modelers that I train. Business people love to \\"show their stuff\\" by displaying complicated process models and business diagrams, sometimes spending as long as an hour explaining what it means.    BIG MISTAKE!!! If you can't get people to understand your model or picture in the first glance or two, your point will lose impact and you could miss getting your message across.     Almost every page contains simple diagrams to bring each and every point across to the reader. I would have given this book 5 stars, except the author tried to create a methodology and acronym SQVID that missed the mark by being too complex. Also, the \\"how to\\" example could have been better - and given the author an opportunity to really showcase his methodology's effectiveness.     Read this book - and after you finish, read \\"Make it Stick.\\" These two books together will help you become more effective with business communications.
0307386171|5.0|I finished this beautiful story in one afternoon.  I have read several of Ian McEwan's books and have loved every single one.  He has this uncanny knack of drawing you into every agonizing situation, causing you to feel exactly what the character is feeling.  Much like Atonement, the last few pages make your stomach turn and a lump gather in your throat.  Ian McEwan is writing genius personified, proven again in this wonderful novel.
B00006DEF9|5.0|Singin' In The Rain is one of those rare films where everything works: casting, music, sets script and costumes. The two disc package by Turner Entertainment helps the viewer to see and understand the place of the musical in American film history.    The story of Don Lockwood (Gene Kelly), Cosmo Brown (Donald O'Conner) and  Kathy Selden (Debbie Reynolds) is familiar to most viewers. The inside look at Hollywood in the time of the transition from silent film to talkies has been covered in other places but nowhere is it as effective as it was in this 1952 film.    The Special Edition Package contains a weath of material that has been restored completely. The film is in spectacular Technicolor and looks even better than it did when it played on the screen. There is a commentary with nine participants hosted by Debbie Reynolds that covers just about all aspects of the production process. A feature called Rell Sound provides clips from films that were critical to the sound to talkie transition. A branching feature on Inspirations for the film gives three segments of hidden footage relating to specific scenes. The first disc is rounded out with the original trailer and some cast and awards information.    The bulk of the special features are on disc two. The disc starts with the feature length Musical Glorious Musicals: The Arthur Freed Unit at MGM. This feature highlights the life and work of the famed producer. A second feature What A Glorious Feeling is a 35 minute retrospective coving the making of the film and is hosted by Debbie Reynolds. There is an extended selection of excerpts of the Freed-Brown musical numbers taken from their original films. This is a wealth of material that puts the songs from the film in perspective. The final section of the disc gives us the original MGM Orchestra scoring sessions for just about all of the music in the film.    This is a well put together package that is a joy to watch. It is essential viewing for any fan of the MGM musicalperiod.
1869505301|2.0|I have been traveling around New Zealand for 5 months and a friend and I took this book with us on a road trip around the South Island. It was a sore disappointment.     The directions in the book are horribly vague, sometimes to the point of nonsensical. Using \\"a repaired fence\\" is a poor idea of a landmark, as 4 years out after the publication of the guide the fence is no longer there. Be prepared for very unclear directions that refer to such movable items as \\"park benches\\" and \\"lone bathrooms\\" or \\"a fallen log\\" (in the woods? who would have imagined!)     Additionally, I was really startled to discover that only by comparing this book to the earlier version did some information become clear. There are bits of information in each that are not synthesized across both, so only by stopping into a bookstore briefly to consult the earlier guide did we discover that several of the sites we had intended to visit were not accessible to the public -- handy information to include in the second guide.    This guide requires a LOT of legwork by the reader. (Perhaps only by the GPS coordinates do the directions become clear, I didn't try.) After doing a lot of independent research and consulting several maps and local tourist information sites did we finally find a majority of the sites. Very very poor organization and information. While this book and its predecessor are the only detailed guides published for those searching the Lord of the Rings sites, they still require close study and a lot of external work.      Above all, what the book is lacking is clear direction and a good editor. The organization is very confused so that stories of being on the set are mixed with recommendations for non-LotR related tours and good wineries for lunch breaks, on top of the sub-par directions. While this gave a great sense of the author's enjoyment of the research process, it really doesn't add to clarifying the purpose of the book as a Location Guidebook.      A poor book with very little method to its madness: it's haphazard, ambiguous, and ultimately frustrating to put to use. I HIGHLY recommend that no one rely on this book as their sole guide to finding locations.     (I also find it underhanded and shady that the author reviewed his own book on Amazon. Given that the information in his head didn't translate wholly to the page, a five-star review might only be applicable from the same.)

0783229526|5.0|Fear and Loathing in Las Vegas, a Terry Gilliam film, is an adaptation of Hunter Thompson's classic autobiographical account about his experience covering a motorcycle race in Nevada in the early 1970's.  The late Thompson's book has become one of the most widely read cult classics in literature and Gilliam stays true to form with his contribution to it, creating a near literal, cinematic translation.  Gilliam lent his adept directorial skills to other memorable films as well, such as The Fisher King, Twelve Monkeys, and Brazil.  Johnny Depp, in one of his most humorous performances, depicts Thompson's alter ego, journalist Raoul Duke.  Duke is dispatched to southern Nevada to cover a motorcycle race in the desert, taking with him an unbalanced lawyer named Dr. Gonzo, who's portrayed by Benicio Del Toro.  The two amble in and around Las Vegas for a couple of days, while consuming massive quantities of drugs and alcohol.  The film encompasses a number of interesting distinctions between the ideologies of the 1960's and the excesses of the 1970's.   It was Andy Warhol who said, \\"In the 60's, everybody got interested in everybody else.  Everybody was equal suddenly-dubutantes and chauffeurs, waitresses, and governors.\\"  Ironically, the 70's were a rupudiation of all that, beginning the very first year of the decade, when four college students were brutally killed by National Guardsmen in the state of Ohio.  Perhaps sensing his own death in 1968, Robert F. Kennedy once said, \\"Progress is a nice word.  But change is its motivator.  And change has its enemies.\\"  More than anything else, Fear and Loathing stands as a tribute to the eccentric, yet brilliant writing of Hunter Thompson.    May he rest in peace!!

0385340990|5.0|This book will be required reading for my 3 sons who were all born in Guernsey some 30 plus years ago.  It should also be required for most citizens of the U.K. who still have no idea that Guernsey was occupied by Germany during World War 2.<br />It is a very enjoyable book.
B00127RAJY|4.0|I use the 30 Day Shred DVD when I either don't have time to do a full workout, or if I can't get to the gym. I think it is a very effective workout. There are 3 Levels to the DVD and each one is about 18 mins of actual exercise, with a brief warm up and cool down peroid. I only did level 1 once, because it is not as intense as levels 2 and 3. The DVD is great beacuse it incorporates strenghth moves that are familiar with cardio that gets your heart pumping in new and different ways.   For beginners, or those unfamiliar with typical weightlifting moves, I reccommend you watch the DVD first to get a good idea of the different moves and the proper form. Overall it is a great addition to my collection, and to my workout routine!
1591841666|4.0|This review was written by my 7th-grade daughter:<br /><br />The Dip is a little book about when to quit and when to stick. It tells you how to persevere through obstacles in jobs, new things you want to try, or things you're trying like a band you want to start. The Dip is a temporary setback that you will have to wade through like thick syrup.<br /><br />People quit things they want they want to do because the cost may seem too high. People don't have a lot of time and don't want to take a lot of risks. In school teachers tell kids that once a problem gets too hard they should move on to the next one. The low handing fruit is there to be taken; no sense wasting time climbing the tree. The Dip is the long stretch between beginners luck and real accomplishment.<br /><br />I recommend The Dip to people that have lost faith and believe that what they are trying to do is too hard because either their boss, coach, or someone else is not the kindest person to them, or when their environment is not the nicest. I believe that this book will give you great advice on how to live through dips and any rough path you have to get to before achieving your goal.
B00004RFFS|5.0|When it was reported in the media that Tom Cruise was to play the lead part of Lestat, the legendary vampire, in Anne Rice's \\"Interview with the Vampire\\", the author herself was dead set against casting the famous movie star as her lead character.  However after seeing the completed version of the film, Rice revised her opinion of Cruise and pronounced the performance \\"brilliant\\".  This role, keep in mind, was passed over originally by Daniel Day Lewis and Jeremy Irons and in retrospect, they would've been too old to play the ever youthful Lestat so I think Cruise was an excellent choice.  Also excellent are Brad Pitt as the doomed Louis and a very young Kirsten Dunst as the little girl who never ages.  Neil Jordan, coming off his recent hit, \\"The Crying Game\\", also delivered with an involving psychological horror film of the first caliber. I am now renting this film in Blu-ray and will comment on its quality which is in debate by some of the customers here.  Nevertheless, Blu-ray or standard, this is a film worth seeing if you're a fan of the book or an Anne Rice.  I think Cruise is an under-rated actor who has also given brilliant performances in \\"Born on the 4th of July\\" and \\"Magnolia\\" but because of his good looks is often ignored (The Cary Grant fate!!) as Michael Caine has stated in an interview.  Let's hope he doesn't do too many action films and goes for the jugular in his future films!!

0446579939|5.0|As I read Nicholas Sparks' newest novel THE LUCKY ONE, I, as usual, found myself drawn into the characters, the love story and the conflict. As I neared the last 70 pages, I thought, this could be one of the best novels I'v read, not just from Sparks, but from anybody. Sparks had set up everything perfectly, but could he create a satisfying ending?<br /><br />For reasons that will be explained later in the novel, Logan Thibault decides to walk from Colorado to Hamtpon, North Carolina with his German Shepard, Zeus. He is on a journey to find a woman in a photo. While serving in Iraq, Logan found the photo half buried in the sand. Unable to find the owner of the picture, Logan kept it. And through three tours of duty, he survived many brushes with death. He didn't want to admit it, but he believed the picture may have been why he survived.<br /><br />Beth is a single mom. Her ex-husband Keith is a jerk who is dissapointed that their son Ben isn't the athletic adventurer type. Logan shows up in Hamton and begins working at the dog kennel where Beth lives and helps out her grandma. This is a Sparks novel, so of course you're going to see a romance develop. But there is a lot more. All the characters have secrets, and the revealing of the secrets has the potential to do a lot of harm. A highlight for me was the relationship between Ben and Logan.<br /><br />So, did the ending of THE LUCKY ONE uphold the promise of the beginning? I believe it did and I highly recommend this novel. Sparks is on record saying he writes \\"love stories\\" and not romances, meaning readers aren't always guaranteed a happy, tidy ending. This novel has more of suspense element than other Sparks novels, stemming from the fact that the conflict comes from the immature, irrational Keith Clayton. The conflict in this book is notable in that it doesn't come from a natural disaster or a sickness, but from the characters.<br /><br />This is one Sparks book I'd love to see made into a movie.
B000002N25|5.0|Great CD but cut 13 & 14 were flawed.  Too bad because I really liked \\"Done with Bonaparte\\"
B001GAPC1K|4.0|This is a decent movie. I like the plot. I haven't had a chance to check out all the extra BD-Live features yet, but the movie itself is just like Spiderman, Batman, Hulk, Transformers etc so if you are into those movies, you'll like this one too.
B001GKJ2DO|5.0|Mamma Mia! opened on July 10th in the Philippines which was more than a week ahead of its US release on July 18th. It ran for almost 3 months in theaters here in Manila where a hit movie would probably last up to three (3) weeks and a dud would just play for a few days. I saw this film almost 20 times in different theaters around Manila and saw how people from all ages - the teens to the older generation - enjoyed the film. Maybe it was the music, maybe it was the acting and the singing, maybe it was the lush setting in Greece. It was all of these. The producers were able to weave a wonderful story of love lost and found amidst an impending wedding set in a remote Greek island with the timeless tunes of ABBA. What really helped in the appreciation of ABBA's music was the familiar arrangements which Benny and Bjorn did not change but even enhanced a bit. The familiarity really struck a nostalgic chord especially with the generation who grew up with ABBA's music. The showstopper of course was Dancing Queen played in the middle of the film where Donna and the Dynamos start singing in the room and go out into the streets and are joined by the village women in an anthem of woman empowerment. Even the finale is wonderful where they sing Dancing Queen as a trio with Waterloo as the fitting ending song where the Dynamos are joined by the men and the young couple Sophie and Sky. Believe it or not, in the Philippines, people never stay for the credits and in fact automatically head for the exit when a movie or a concert finishes (it's a given - they have no appreciation for credits and would rather be ahead of the rest in getting out of the venue) but with Mamma Mia! people really stayed to see Dancing Queen again and until Waterloo was over - and some stayed until the final notes of Thank You for the Music. I was aghast to read that critics bashed Mamma Mia! But this is plain amusing to most of the people who appreciated this wonderful film. Critics and bashers can say all the negative things they want but the people have spoken with it's resounding commercial success - Mamma Mia's soundtrack hit No. 1 on the Billboard Top 200 Albums and has been certified platinum (no ABBA album ever hit the Top 10 in the US). Mamma Mia! the movie has grossed almost $144 MM at the US box-office to make it the 4th biggest grossing musical of all time in the US (behind Grease, Chicago and The Sound of Music). Mamma Mia! the movie did even better in the UK because it has grossed 67 MM pounds and is the second biggest film of all time in the UK behind Titanic which grossed 69 MM pounds. Not bad indeed! Bravo to the cast! Meryl Streep proved in this film that she can do absolutely anything! America's finest actress is poised for a double win at the Golden Globes in 2009 -Best Actress in a Musical / Comedy for Mamma Mia! (her brilliant singing in Winner Takes it All alone can make her win the Globe) and Best Actress in a Drama for Doubt. A fitting reward for a truly great actress! The upcoming DVD deserves all the attention it can get. The perfect Christmas gift. Cheers!!!
B00005JPO1|5.0|This movie is pretty decent and exciting. It is because after many years of waiting, it finally returns and doesn't bring disappointment. For the story, it is like the usual series so it is okay. For the acting, they are all performing well especially Harrison Ford as Henry \\"Indiana\\" Jones Jr. For the direction, they are quite on track and make sense. For the visuals, it is very good. Compare to this film to others, it is better than the other series in the franchise because it is the most exciting one. Overall, this movie is so good.<br /><br />The DVD: This edition of this DVD is so good and complete because it provides the \\"behind the scene\\" and also the very important trailers.  I loved it.
0375826726|4.0|This book was quite entertaining, although some parts were a bit boring and \\"hard\\" to read.
B0014I4KIK|5.0|I have listened to this CD repeatedly since receiving it.  It has a wonderful folksy, old-soul sound to it!  I bought it after seeing the Mercy video on tv one weekend.  I was pleasantly surprised by the rest of the CD.  I look forward to other releases from her.  I honestly had no idea of what to expect when I bought this CD and wasn't let down by a one-hit production!  I love the song Mercy, but would have a hard time picking my favorite song on the CD!
0810995212|5.0|I've been searching for years for good Leyendecker work as reference. This book seems to have a nearly comprehensive collection of his professional work. Almost every page has nice color reproductions of his work. Only drawbacks, the book is not large and some of the artwork is sized down quite a bit on the pages. But as a whole this book is fantastic for it's collection of Leyendecker's beautiful work.
B000XTLUW0|5.0|I ordered this thinking that I would enjoy watching one of the best live bands preforming live. I was astounded. Muse is my favorite band and they are ten times better live on this DVD. If you like Muse at all then you will absolutly love this. There is a lot of varity in the song choices so you will never feel bored.
B000BLI4PG|4.0|...you know what would really have rocked???    One little sound clip -   \\"clinkclinkclinkclink Warriors Come Out And Plaaaaay  clinkclinkclinkclink Warriors Come out and PLAAAAEEEEEEAAAAYYYY\\"    That would have rocked.....
B0007YMUZW|4.0|Great double disc album!  There's a nice balance of slow stuff and rockin' stuff, all good.  It has a pretty classic Ryan Adams sound- edgy alt-country with a really well produced \\"live recording\\" sort of feel.  Not at all like the \\"Rock 'n Roll\\" album, not as happy sounding as \\"Gold,\\" a little more up-beat than \\"Heartbreaker,\\"  it may be somewhere between \\"Jacksonville City Nights\\" and \\"29.\\"  Truly one of my favorite albums currently.
B000GCFO0I|4.0|I beg to differ with Amazon.com's review. While far from a perfect film, the imaginative visuals and the atmosphere of Silent Hill make it a thoroughly terrifying viewing experience. Though the plot is abstract the premise is simple enough, and some indiscretions in narrative are forgivable since this is a film dealing with the supernatural. My only complaint with the story was the utterly superfluous subplot involving Rose's husband, which did nothing for the film but break up the momentum and suspense of the main storyline.     I would venture that most horror buffs aren't looking for literary excellence but rather a good scare and an original idea in a genre that's become quite saturated with mediocre films. Silent Hill offers enough frightening visuals, a gentle foray into social commentary on the dangers of organized religion, and above average dialog, which earns it a respectable place in the horror catalog.
B001CD6FKS|4.0|I know some people don't think of it as such a great movie, but I LOVED it.  I think all of the actors did a really good job and played Speed Racer to be what it should have been.  And it looks Great in Blu Ray
1428166556|5.0|One of those books that can change the way you see the world and (as usual for such books) it does so with humor, clear unpretentious language and examples. As another reviewer already said, the point of the book could have been stated in a couple of lines, but then we'd miss the great writing and more importantly, the internalization of what Taleb is talking about.<br /><br />Some of my favorite parts:<br /><br />* Turkey Problem (Induction): For 999 days, the turkey is loved and cared for by human beings. Why should it worry or have any doubts. But then on the 1000th day there's a surprise awaiting it. The title illustrates this point too. It only takes one contradiction, one knife, one black swan to prove wrong an infinity of verifications.<br /><br />* Extremistan vs. Mundanistan: In a stadium full of people, one person, even the tallest in the world, won't offset the average height by very much. Same with age, or with weight, or caloric intake. These qualities are of Mundanistan. However, with things like money (ie. Bill Gates enters the stadium) one person can outweigh the entire group. Things like net worth are from Extremistan. Our prediction models are based on Mundanistan, however many of the things that can impact us most are from Extremistan (ie. impact of disease, medicine, wars, weather) and hence our prediction models don't work.<br /><br />* Ludic Fallacy (seeing the map as the terrain) via Brooklyn Tony and the actuary. This is my favorite part of the book!<br /><br />Thought experiment at a bar (this isn't an exact quote, sounded much better in the book):<br />Taleb: I tossed a fair coin 99 times and got heads each time. What are my odds of heads on the next toss?<br />Dr. John (the actuary): 50/50.<br />Tony: At least 99 to 1.<br />John: But why? The previous tosses have nothing to do with the next one.<br />Tony: You're either full of crap or a pure sucker to buy that fifty percent business. The coin's gotta be loaded.<br /><br />I love it!
0143113100|5.0|Predating Sharon Begley's groundbreaking book [[ASIN:0345479890 Train Your Mind, Change Your Brain: How a New Science Reveals Our Extraordinary Potential to Transform Ourselves]] by a few months, Doidge approaches the new brain science from the perspective of topical studies and personal stories.  A practicing psychiatrist, he looks at how we can apply the new science to self-image, bad habits and obsessions, acquiring tastes, and even sexual attraction.  What's unique and helpful is his discussion of the dark side of brain change.  The book also serves as a warning that though we can become more flexible, there is a negative side that can result in stubborn habits and disorders.      Doidge does not deal with the new breakthroughs that are happening as a result of physical therapy and work with victims of the Iraqi war.  Just the same, this is a very powerful and illuminating work. It is also a very readable book, not smelling of the ivory tower.
0142000663|4.0|One of my favorite books is East of Eden, I also loved Of Mice & Men.  I'd never read Grapes of Wrath for school, like most people, I figured it was about time.  Having high hopes, I was a little disappointed.  I did not like it nearly as the other Steinbeck's I'd read.  But, still the overall work makes an amazing piece of history, fiction and memorable tale.  Personally, I think it's highly relevent at this period in time with what our country is going through.<br /><br />Mainly, this book was a little tough to keep reading on, as the story didn't immediately grip me.  I was about half way through before I really got into it.  Before I really began to care about the characters and get where this novel was going or what it was trying to convey.  Yet there were times when I'd just sit back and slowly read a page and take in the beauty of what was written.<br /><br />I did give it 4 stars because I think the writing, the story that it tells about the Oklahoma farmers & migrant farmers and the symbolism was phenominal!  To me this book tells the story of our history, one that is important to tell and remember.  There's a reason it won the Pulitzer.
0345472322|5.0|The subtitle stinks. It makes the reader think that the substance of the book is merely a different approach to positive thinking. NOT SO! Instead, this is a great book. Here's why. It answers two very important questions--and it does so from a very solid research basis: why is that some extremely bright people fail to achieve? and why is it that some people who seem only to be ordinary, achieve greatly?     Furthermore, it challenges the deeply and widely held cultural beliefs about human intelligence--the dogma that intelligence (or IQ) is innate and hardwired. Old dogma dies hard. Once concepts are deeply embedded, a superstructure of assumptions and ideas grows around it. Rejecting a dogma means that many ideas are now questionable, and . . . as a result a close read of a book or thoughtful analysis of a new and complex idea is impossible. As an acquaintance of mine said about these ideas: \\"I don't believe it. I can't believe it. Everything I've ever learned about intelligence and achievement would go out the window.\\" He tuned out. It was a losing battle I chose not to fight.     What Carol really needs to say--but you can't do it in a book--is that we have profoundly imbibed a cultural attitude that is so wrongheaded, it impacts everything we think about intelligence and achievement. And the failure to look seriously at these ideas is Nutso!     There's another way to get at the same issue: Why is it that so many Asians do so well in college and in business? Is it that they're Asian? Nahhhh. It's just that they never heard that \\"the cream rises to the top.\\" That wasn't permitted. Instead, it's if you got a B instead of an A on that test, why didn't you work harder? The Asian mindset is profound--and it results in high achievement. The middle class American mindset that you've only got so much ability is deeply held--and often results in mediocre achievement.     After our middle daughter graduated from a top university, she was sitting on the front stoop of ourhome, and a friend who hadn't achieved asked what her father would have done if she hadn't graduated. Without missing a beat, she responded with a smile: \\"He would have murdered me!\\"     That's Carol Dweck's well-researched thesis: Teach your kids and yourself to work smart and keep learning, while you're working hard...and don't stop. It's the key, ultimately, to competitive advantage and American success in a global economy.

B001KVQTXA|5.0|Jazz was never really an interest of mine until a friend introduced this record to me. As a drummer, I was blown away by Dave Weckl. It's not just his technique but how he manages to be part of the band while still standing out. There's a great mix of songs, layered arrangements, and Corea's keyboard work is second to none. Even 20 years later, this CD still brings a smile to my face.
B00000J7SS|5.0|Bitches Brew was the last defining moment where (in my opinion) Miles had spontaneously changed the entire landscape of jazz at his whim. ..  This album single-handedly started the jazz-fusion movement in the 70s.  & that in my opinion is where jazz took a leap of faith and caught up with the 60s thanks to Miles.  Trippy music that played with your mind and body and soul had come to life but not to fruition until this album.  Period.  Thank you for your time and support.
B001DHXT2A|3.0|You know the synopsis, so let's get to the bottom line:  Worth watching once; Extras are worth the viewing; and packaging is professional.  Family friendly, but plenty of violence and shooting...  The beginning and middle are well directed and the story is top-notch... though the film loses splendor toward the second half. CGI is iffy during some scenes toward the end also. Is it worth owning? Sure, if you pre-ordered it.

1401300529|4.0|The Coldest Winter by David Halberstam is not a perfect history of the Korean War.  There were two historical facts missing which I think any credible historian would have to mention.  One is the incident at the Bridge of Tokun Ri where hundreds of civilians were killed by American troops in what is euphenistically known as a \\"friendly fire\\" incident.  The other is the disgraceful conduct of the all-Black 92nd Regiment which was disbanded as \\"unbreliable\\" after they broke ranks and ran to the rear after hearing their first gunshot.  History is a moving target and the first casualty in war is the truth.  Here's a tip.  Go to any library and check out the books of history of the Vietnam War.  If you find no reference to \\"fraggings\\", you know you aren't going to read the whole truth but one that has been sanitized.  Fraggings refers to the murder or attempted murder of U.S. officers or non-coms by their own men.  The weapon of choice was a fragmentation grenade which leaves no fingerprints.  More than 1,000 U.S. officers and non-coms were murdered by their own men during the war with thousands more wounded.  These are estimates.  The U.S. army only kept records for about 18 months in 1970-71 and recorded several hundred fraggings.  And this is just one service branch, not counting the Marines, Navy or Air Force.  Always read history as a moving target and understand that in a war, the first casulty is truth.

B00023B1A8|5.0|I've said it in other reviews about these guys, and I'll say it here, there is NOBODY that sounds like these guys.  You can do all the studio tricks you want, but if you can't pull it off live, you're screwed.  The music may be different from the albums, but the vocals are the same.  These guys sound live how they do in the studio.  What an awesome showing by the boys.  Funniest part is, you fast-forward 15 years to Deja Vu Live, they sound almost as good as they do here.<br />There is not a bad song on this DVD.  This is a great trip down memory lane.  It's only a shame Neil Young wasn't there for this.
B000YXMMAE|1.0|The popularity of Radiohead makes about as much sense to me as the popularity of Coldplay.<br />In my opinion... they are a Talking Heads knock off ( a band that's even WORSE than Radiohead )<br />Coldplay is even Dumber than Radiohead Because they are trying to be like U2!<br />Congrats to all the media's sheep who think these guys are \\"complex\\" and \\"brilliant\\" You're all heroes to me, because I just can't stomach that much crap!
0394716787|5.0|Overall I enjoyed this product. I have been looking for some time for a complete collection of Edgar Allen Poe. Can't beat the price either. This book features all of his stories and poems. The only draw back was that I was really looking for this kind of collection in hard back, and I would have liked a book with notes on his stories. Don't get me wrong though, I am enjoying this book a lot.
B001GZ6QDS|1.0|This has to be the most overrated movie of all-time! I heard about how amazing it was so for the first time in years I finally left my house and actually went to see it- a triumph alone! Let me tell you, this movie was such a disappointment. I hated it. I was close to sleeping throughout the whole film. It was generic, predictable and downright horrendous. If you want true entertainment check out some films by the great director Uwe Boll.

B000002VQQ|1.0|Who still listens to this junk? First, she isn't even hot. Who listens to ugly female singers? Listen to true beauties like Jessica Simpson. Hot = talent. Second, this album is like 1000 years old. It never even got any BET airplay! An artist is only good if they're on BET. Third, this is commerical, generic garbage! It was overproduced, too commercial and Patti's voice was generated through a computer. What you're hearing is basically a machine making this pathetic excuse for \\"music\\". She even tried making a rap song (\\"Redondo Beach\\"). Wow, Patti, give it up. You'll never be as good as 50 Cent. Sorry.

B000P2A24W|5.0|If one of my favourite singers, hard-rocking Chris Daughtry of American Idol fame and one of my other favourite singers, Carrie Underwood, also of American Idol fame made an album it would sound like this! Every song sounds completely different from the other, despite some jealous hater reviews. You wish you could make an album this epic! Every song is played at a virtuoso-level of instrumentals, while Jon Bon Jovi's voice keeps getting better and better. He almost sounds as good as Chad Kroger from Nickleback! I advise you buy this album NOW!!

B000002OX7|1.0|My mom made me leave the house for the first time in years or I would be grounded from World Of Warcraft for a week! Ugh! So I was taking a walk around this old junkyard and was rummaging though a pile of trash and found this album on cassette. I was excited- a new album to listen to! I put it in my Walkman from 1993 and hoped for an awesome album (hopefully as good as \\"St.Anger\\"). What a disappointment! I hated this album! Here's why:<br />1.) All songs sound the same<br />2.) Do they even have a bassist? I sure as heck can't hear the bass.<br />3.) The guitarist was awful<br />4.) The drumming was so simple, all in 4/4<br />5.) The vocals were horrid! He sounded like a dying cat<br />6.) The songs were generic and uncreative<br />Also, they were never on MTV or BET! So that's an automatic fail. Listen to some real music like Bon Jovi, people.

B000002U82|1.0|SNORE. I can't believe some of you dorky stoners trapped in the '70s have the nerve to call this album a \\"masterpiece\\" or \\"one of the best albums of all-time\\"! LOL, MUSIC NERDS! You people can't be serious. They didn't even get any MTV or BET airplay. Therefore, they automatically are horrible. I suggest you listen to a great album like \\"St.Anger\\" by Metallica or \\"Lost Highway\\" by Bon Jovi if you want a taste of what real music should sound like.
B0008ENICU|4.0|We watched this movie in a group of ladies on a ladies weekend.  The younger crowd (under 30) found the movie espeically delightful - not of their usual genre.  They loved the over dramatized dialogue and intrigues.  The older audience enjoyed revisiting a clasic.  The all female cast was handled superbly - you didn't even realize there weren't any men in the production.  The only draw back was that the dialogue is very fast and you have to listen carefully.
B000000W5L|1.0|The Rolling Stones are garbage for old dorky hippies! Don't waste your money on this generic garbage. Listen to some awesome music like 50 Cent, Soulja Boy, Carrie Underwood or Green Day instead. You know why this band sucks? Besides every song sounding the same, they never got any MTV or BET airplay. What gives?!

B00168OINK|5.0|I had not seen this in theaters so the Blu-Ray was my first time viewing this movie.  I liked the trailers and knew that it would look great so I snagged it up and gave it a whirl.  It met and then exceeded my expectations.  They did a wonderful job with everything about this movie.  I've been a long time animation fan and have appreciated what Dreamworks has done with their animated movies, CGI and the handrawn stuff before that.  They have all seemed a little more pop culture like and, while fun to watch once, not really much for repeat viewing.  I can watch Pixar movies over and over again, but never went back to Shrek, Madagascar, Shark Tale or any other Dreamworks movie more than once or twice.<br />Kung Fu Panda is a new level for them though.  It has a good story, comedy, heart, action and style.  I love the look of this movie.  The fight scenes made me feel the same way I do watching live action Jackie Chan or Jet Li movies.  I really got into them.  The character design is stylish without being distracting, but I would have liked to know more about The Furious Five.  I was upset that the DVD came with a 20 minute DVD about them, but it was not included on the Blu-Ray.<br />Bottom line, Dreamworks got it right with this movie and it is worth a buy.  It is a world that I would like to re-visit again.  I already want to watch it again just to see the fight sequences and I hope they make a sequel that is just as good.

1400032717|5.0|A very interestingly-written exploration into an unlikely protagonist, a seemingly mediocre / dark plot, and unusual writing styles.

Not many films can promise that anymore! I've dragged my husband to many movies and he hymned and hawed about sitting through everyone ... this one included. But this was the first time he ever wanted to stay in the theater and watch it again RIGHT AWAY! It doesn't matter if Pierce Brosnan can't sing ... I can't sing either. It didn't stop him and it didn't stop me!<br /><br />This movie is best viewed by people who know when NOT to be serious, love to smile and have an appreciation for a good ABBA song!
B001ED7C58|4.0|I have read the other reviews on here and a great deal of people seem to be giving the soundtrack a low rating based upon their love of the books and how they thought the soundtrack should be.  I will admit, I love the books, and the soundtrack could not be more different that I expected, but that does not make it a bad collection of songs.  THe song has a good mix of pseudo-emo/alternative bands that are this second's \\"IT\\" bands.  Of course they had to include the British band Muse and Linkin Park due mostly in part to Stephenie Myers.  I enjoy the music as a stand alone, not listening to it thinking this is the Twilight soundtrack.  I am curious to see the movie and see how they used the music and if it actually fit or if it seemed like they forced the pop culture music in there.  All in all a good collection of songs.
B001IMJWW6|5.0|Nosferatu should absolutely be respected for it's contribution to, and advancement of, the film industry and particularly horror movies. The film offers special effects that were cutting edge at the time and still maintain some of their power in creating terror and tension. I had reservations about watching Nosferatu. Since I love movies that make good use of sound, the idea of silent film didn't interest me. I had similar prejudices toward the special effects, cinematography, acting, etc. I figured Nosferatu was a classic for purely nostalgic reasons. I mean, how could anybody actually enjoy a movie that could have been shot by a seventeen-year-old with a crappy camera? How naive I was...    Nosferatu is an exercise in brilliant film-making. Murnau's heavy investment on the look of the film pays off. The film is fun to watch. The acting is over the top, which is necessary to avoid constant cuts to dialog cards. The music is great, too. Chilling and expressive without being overbearing.
B0009A40ES|5.0|I went into purchasing this film, feeling a tad uneasy of what I would be viewing. I didn't know whether I'd be seeing a horror movie or a satire and a comedy.     To my utter delight. It was a mixture of all three listed items. It was a horror in all of its fantasmic images, but it was also satirical. I laughed at several parts of the movie and cringed when I knew another death was coming! If you see it, you'll know what I mean. And of course the film is explicit, graphic in its sexual presentation. But that's only to further emphasize how utterly lost and dominant that man has truly become. For instance, he can't even handle the fact that another man 'has' a better business card than him. You can see it each time on his face.    There was another thing that got me. The man is crying out for help, crying out to be heard in all of the insanity that he's either brought on other people, but also, himself.     I've watched this movie once, but I will be watching it again, and again, and again...This coming from someone who vowed never to see it because of its alleged contents! It's a very cool movie.     Fact is, I only got this movie because Christian Bale was in it and I've been collecting his other movies since The Dark Knight.     But the man can act!     Oh! The ending. Well, that's just something that you'll have to sort out for yourself (not giving anything away, grins). But it's definitely something to see (you must rent or buy this movie!).    Again, I hope that this review was informative, coming from someone who really had no intention of viewing this movie at all.     Go out!     Buy it!    And enjoy it!     And then watch it again!    You'll be glad you did!

0618918248|3.0|Let me start by saying that I am currently in the middle of a PhD in evolutionary biology, and I also have a bachelors degree in philosophy - specifically focusing on epistemology, science and religion.    Dawkins' book is enjoyable however there are a number of problems.  Throughout I couldn't help but feel he is an extremely angry man.  He presents a good reason to be angry, but still, something about every sentense felt angry in tone.    Dawkins is not a biblical scholar, nor a philosopher of religion.  I would recommend a book such as Stephen Davies introduction to the philosophy of religion for those that are truely interested in evaluating arguments around the hypothesis of a theistic god.  Davies goes through theistic and athiestic arguments succinctly and in an easy to understand manner.    What this book does is highlight some of the absurdity present in the major theistic religions and texts.  It is often amusing and I do not mean to fully condemn it.  It touches on some of the philosophical arguments, but does not critique them adequately.  Basically I see this book as what would happen if you got an erudite evolutionary biologist with an antipathy to religion to do some reading on the flaws of major organised religion and report back.    If you want a light book looking at religion and its flaws written well, this is for you.

B000J233SK|5.0|Loreena McKennitt is one of the least known Irish folk singers while being one of the best. I've known about her for about 10 years and have several of her cd's. I first heard her while listening to an Irish radio station on the internet and heard her sing \\"The Highwayman\\" which is an epic poem. I was blown away and HAD to have that cd and after hearing the rest of the music on it, have become a big fan. Take a chance and you will not be disappointed.
B001ED7C58|3.0|The CD is ok. The song by Paramore - Decode - is a great song, though little to do with Twilight, in my opinion. The soundtrack doesn't really start getting good until the last 4.  Other than \\"Decode\\", there aren't really any memorable songs. Nothing that stands out. It's oddly arranged, too. All the faced-paced songs are at the beginning and the last 4 songs are slow. Very strange. But, Rob Pattinson's song is really interesting. And odd. I would have never guessed in a thousand years that it was him singning. I was also pretty disappointed with Bella's lullaby. Too easy and not at all like the character. I agree with many others that the perfect Bella's Lullaby should have been a remix of River Flows In You by Yurima. Over all, it's worth having if you're an obsessive Twilight fan like me, but, it's pretty mediocre. My advice, buy it off Itunes, so you can get the extra Rob Pattinson song.
0618001905|5.0|To the extent that the Belgians impinge on the American sense of history at all, they exist in a kind of permanent heroic relief, bravely standing strong against the juggernaut of Kaiser Wilhelm in World War I. Their brave defense of Liege, and the courageous stand of King Albert I when he fought the German onslaught remain as poster-child images of an honorable European nation.<br /><br />Adam Hochschild paints a horrific tale that makes adherents of divine retribution see a just punishment in both world wars for the atrocities committed against Africans in the Belgian Congo. Other readers have faulted the book for its sketchy treatment of the Congo, its myriad tribes, languages, customs, and varied landscape, but as an introduction to the most despotic depradations since the Spanish Conquest, the book is enlightening, riveting, and wrenching.<br /><br />I could not read the chapters consecutively, so terrible is the litany of atrocities perpetrated by the Belgians. This book will take your breath away with its awfulness. It chronicles the pogroms that were enforced on tribes who could not collect their quotas of rubber, and it repeats in awful detail the torture and sadism of colonial rulers who cut off the hands of living children in order to run up false tallies of the dead. Each chapter devolves into a series of calamities more gruesome than the one before, and the only way I got through the book was by taking hourlong breaks in between chapters.<br /><br />This book is an invaluable primer on colonial Belgium in the Congo. It is a continuation of the slave trade practiced hundreds of years before, and reflects the true nature of European attitudes towards Africa during a time when the slave trade had been extinct for more than a century. This is compelling and moving history at its very best.

B00003003R|3.0|Back in '91, I was THE biggest GN'R fan on the face of the earth: I knew all of their lyrics word by word (even though I didn't understand 'em all, they played a huge part in my future mastery of the language), knew every single cymbal crash from their drums, I could sing every single note of their guitar solos. But then, as the original lineup of the band started to slowly but surely erode, so did their impact on me and I started to get interested in other artists by default. Why do I bring this up? 'Cause I think that you should know where I come from and where my head's at now in order to get the full picture of this review.<br /><br />GN'R started as a glamed out, punked up hard rock band from L.A in the mid 80's. But unlike some of the earlier Californian rock bands such as Van Halen, Ratt, Motley Crue and countless others, there was something inherently different to this bunch of slackers: they were a mean, angry, borderline violent group that meant EVERY SINGLE word they said, be it their paranoid delusions (&#34;Out ta get me&#34;), their macho posturing (&#34;It's so Easy&#34;), their struggle with addiction (&#34;Mr Brownstone&#34;) or...their fragility (&#34;Sweet Child o' Mine).<br /><br />They just presented themselves as they were, and because of that, they came across as genuine. Musically though, they were pretty raw: singer W. Axl Rose was an energetic and effective frontman, but he could also be pretty rough around the edges; drummer Steven Adler was far from being a virtuoso, but made up for that with energy to spare; rhythm guitarist Izzy Stradlin was a great songwriter but a somewhat limited player (by his own admission), bassist Duff McKagan was adequate but not stellar, and riffmeister Slash was a diamond in the rough, alternatively mind blowing and lackluster depending of his inebriated state. And yet for all their original shortcomings, one had only to witness a live performance by the band to be sold, such was the overwhelming RN'R vibration that they were able to generate.<br /><br />But then, something happened: they grew up; they evolved. By the time they cut their mammoth &#34;Use Your Illusion&#34; project, they had sacked Adler (a casualty of his overindulgence) in favor of session player Matt Sorum, added keyboards courtesy of one Dizzy Reed and started writing grandiose, sprawling, 9 minute epics. This transition meant that the band, in order to fulfill their higher musical aspirations, had to grow as people and as musicians, push themselves to the limit and shed some of their earlier spontaneity (along with most of their chemical dependencies) in favor of a more calculated, cerebral, musical approach. And to top it all, just 2 months after the release of the &#34;Illusion&#34; records and barely 3 weeks prior to the beginning of the next leg of their tour, Izzy jumps ship and he is quickly replaced by LA bar circuit veteran Gilby Clarke (actually, an old friend of Izzy's from before the time there even was a GN'R...now how's that for irony and/or fate?), whose tangible contribution to the band was very limited, for one reason or another (I don't intend to enter a debate about his musical merits and/or the band's internal politics and workings here).<br /><br />Both of these tangents are captured in after-the-fact release from 1999 &#34;Live Era 87-93&#34; (released 6 years after the last live performance by the band), but unfortunately, the results are less than stellar: indeed, the &#34;before&#34; and &#34;after&#34; sonic pictures herein don't mesh all that well together, as the difference between the two is pretty brutal and can leave the uninitiated quite confused. The record includes no further information as to the sources of these performances other than the purposely vague &#34;recorded across the universe&#34; tag. Many people (critics and fans alike) complain about this issue, arguing that because of this omission, it is &#34;impossible&#34; to know which tracks feature the original five some and which the &#34;Illusion&#34; band.<br /><br />However, those of you with enough interest and a keen ear will find no problem whatsoever: like I said, the difference is brutal! The vast majority of the tracks come from the 2 year-plus &#34;Use your Illusion World Tour&#34;, which is hardly surprising considering that most of these tracks had never been played live before that tour went underway, and the presence of keyboards, horns, synthesizers and backup singers are the easy giveaway (Move to the City, Patience, Don't Cry, November Rain, etc). And then you have a handful of tracks recorded by the original band (My Michelle, Used to Love Her, You're Crazy, Out ta Get me). Granted, there are a couple of tracks that lie in a somewhat &#34;gray area&#34; if you will (It's so Easy, Mr Brownstone), but once again, if you listen closely, you will hear the difference. Let me give you a clue: listen closely to the drums. Listen to the drums on &#34;Estranged&#34;, and then listen to the drums on &#34;My Michelle&#34;, and then listen to the drums on &#34;Nightrain&#34;. You WILL hear the difference, I promise.<br /><br />The song selection is adequate but not great, essentially representing their &#34;Illusion&#34; tour setlist. There are, however, a few suspicious omissions: &#34;Live & Let Die&#34;, &#34;Bad Obsession&#34;, &#34;So Fine&#34;, &#34;Civil War&#34;, &#34;Double Talking Jive&#34; (to name but a few) all got the big thumbs down in favor of extended versions of &#34;November Rain&#34;, &#34;Estranged&#34; and Axl's spotlight number &#34;It's Alright&#34; (notice a trend, here?)<br /><br />Another criticism leveled towards this release is in regards of its sound quality: many argue that the performances have been greatly manipulated and fixed in the studio. Having listened to several bootlegs from the &#34;Use Your Illusion&#34; tour (Paris, Mexico, etc), I have to say that I don't fully agree with this observation: for the most part, the sound of this CD is fairly consistent with what I've heard over the years; there is, however, one aspect of the performances that might have been doctored: the vocals. Indeed, after repeated listening, some of the songs (Nightrain, for instance) sound as if the vocals had been chopped up and spliced together from several different takes, not necessarily studio takes, but several different live takes. And I find it more than a little suspicious that the list of people involved with the production of the album includes so many engineers/sound programmers, including future A Perfect Circle mastermind Billy Howerdel.<br /><br />Many fans feel that they have been shortchanged with the release of a subpar product, and they argue that a release from a single, full show from their bar days would have been the superior choice. I partially agree: see, most people think that &#34;Live Era&#34; is a flawed representation of a great band, while I on the other hand believe that it is a great representation of a flawed band. You can't really argue with the sound quality here, as it is crystal clear, above and beyond any of the bootlegs I've heard. But the problem is not the sound, but rather the performances: the bloated, overindulgent, pretentious performances chockfull of superfluous elements. Don't get me wrong, I don't think there's anything inherently wrong with horn sections, backup singers and/or synths in RN'R, but one thing is the studio environment and a whole different one is the live setting. Take Aerosmith for example: they have used strings and horns from day one on their recordings, but that doesn't mean that when they hit the road they take a big band ensemble with them. They understand the difference between the two environments, but sadly, the guys in GN'R didn't.<br /><br />Personally, I believe that GN'R reached their absolute musical peak during their &#34;Get in the Ring Motherf#cker Tour&#34;, which took place right before the release of the &#34;Illusion&#34; package (don't take my word for it, just go to youtube and see it and HEAR it for yourself), simply because the band reached a new level of musicianship while still retaining a fair amount of reckless rage (granted, most of it was due to intra-band warfare, but still...). Therefore, I think that the selections included in &#34;Live Era&#34; should have been limited to include NOTHING beyond that point. I mean, some of the songs don't even seem to have rhythm guitar at all (Don't Cry, Sweet Child o' Mine, Rocket Queen) with Slash's omnipresent guitar conducting the proceedings, while others (Patience) sound just plain wrong. I personally am a big fan of live albums, but I don't necessarily believe that a great live album HAS to be culled from a single performance. So I think that a much more balanced CD could have been made by a) using as many performances from the original band as possible b) bypassing their horns n' babes phase wholly c) making different song selection. I mean, ALL the songs from Appetite for Destruction should come from shows of that era, wouldn't you agree?<br /><br />Finally, while I do agree that releasing a full, early show from their bar days (such as their shows at the Marquee in London, which were recorded for use as b-sides of their European singles and produced such mythical tracks as their version of AC/DC's &#34;Whole Lotta Rosie&#34;) would undoubtedly blow &#34;Live Era&#34; right off the water, there is the teeny, tiny problem of those shows being relatively short (an hour and 20 minutes or so) in comparison. Rock in Rio '91 comes to mind as well, but they had sound problems and some even say lack of rehearsal time. Oh well...<br /><br />With five stars for sound quality and one star for its musical offering, &#34;Live Era&#34; earns 3 stars for its overall execution. If you're a diehard GN'R fan, you'll probably want to have this while holding your breath waiting for a DEFINITIVE live release from the band. If you're a newcomer, chances are you're going to end up disappointed. At its best, &#34;Live Era&#34; is barely an adequate snapshot of one of the greatest Rn'r of the last 20 years, and at its worst, a sad testament to the powers of a once great band on a downward spiral. The choice is yours...f this CD is fairly consistent with what I've heard over the years; there is, however, one aspect of the performances that might have been doctored: the vocals. Indeed, after repeated listening, some of the songs (Nightrain, for instance) sound as if the vocals had been chopped up and spliced together from several different takes, not necessarily studio takes, but several different live takes. And I find it more than a little suspicious that the list of people involved with the production of the album includes so many engineers/sound programmers, including future A Perfect Circle mastermind Billy Howerdel.<br /><br />Many fans feel that they have been shortchanged with the release of a subpar product, and they argue that a release from a single, full show from their bar days would have been the superior choice.

They understand the difference between the two environments, but sadly, the guys in GN'R didn't.<br /><br />Personally, I believe that GN'R reached their absolute musical peak during their &#34;Get in the Ring Motherf#cker Tour&#34;, which took place right before the release of the &#34;Illusion&#34; package (don't take my word for it, just go to youtube and see it and HEAR it for yourself), simply because the band reached a new level of musicianship while still retaining a fair amount of reckless rage (granted, most of it was due to intra-band warfare, but still...). Therefore, I think that the selections included in &#34;Live Era&#34; should have been limited to include NOTHING beyond that point. I mean, some of the songs don't even seem to have rhythm guitar at all (Don't Cry, Sweet Child o' Mine, Rocket Queen) with Slash's omnipresent guitar conducting the proceedings, while others (Patience) sound just plain wrong. I personally am a big fan of live albums, but I don't necessarily believe that a great live album HAS to be culled from a single performance. So I think that a much more balanced CD could have been made by a) using as many performances from the original band as possible b) bypassing their horns n' babes phase wholly c) making different song selection. I mean, ALL the songs from Appetite for Destruction should come from shows of that era, wouldn't you agree?<br /><br />Finally, while I do agree that releasing a full, early show from their bar days (such as their shows at the Marquee in London, which were recorded for use as b-sides of their European singles and produced such mythical tracks as their version of AC/DC's &#34;Whole Lotta Rosie&#34;) would undoubtedly blow &#34;Live Era&#34; right off the water, there is the teeny, tiny problem of those shows being relatively short (an hour and 20 minutes or so) in comparison. Rock in Rio '91 comes to mind as well, but they had sound problems and some even say lack of rehearsal time. Oh well...<br /><br />With five stars for sound quality and one star for its musical offering, &#34;Live Era&#34; earns 3 stars for its overall execution. If you're a diehard GN'R fan, you'll probably want to have this while holding your breath waiting for a DEFINITIVE live release from the band. If you're a newcomer, chancesare you're going to end up disappointed. At its best, &#34;Live Era&#34; is barely an adequate snapshot of one of the greatest Rn'r of the last 20 years, and at its worst, a sad testament to the powers of a once great band on a downward spiral. The choice is yours...
B001HTSCZI|1.0|First let me start by saying you can avoid this title \\"The Clone Wars\\" ([[ASIN:B001HTSCZI Star Wars: The Clone Wars]]) altogether and instead watch the 2003 series \\"Clone Wars vol 1\\"\\" ([[ASIN:B0006Z2LMO Star Wars - Clone Wars, Vol. 1]]) and \\"Clone Wars vol 1\\"\\" ([[ASIN:B000BCE8Q4 Star Wars - Clone Wars, Vol. 2]]).  Note there is bound to be confusion between the former and latter considering the only difference in title seems to be the work \\"The\\", and this it seems is exactly what Lucas is counting on.  In the remainder of this review I will refer to the work reviewed here as \\"TCW\\", and the superior  2003 series as \\"CW\\".<br /><br />CW was an engaging series of cartoons shown on Cartoon Network.  The writers were given great freedom to work with the characters and universe to produce a work reminiscent of the original Star Wars Movie.  Specifically the stories were clean and straightforward, and the action was intense and well choreographed...in other words CW was fun!  Specifically lacking from CW were drawn out exposition of complicated political sub-plots, and wooden \\"romantic\\" dialogue between Anakin and Padme.  Now contrast this with the current work TCW.  The dialog is wooden, the action is repetitive and boring, and the storytelling is not engaging.  The final death blow for TCW is the introduction of side-kick character Ahsoka Tano whose inanity and banality rivals that of Jar Jar Binks.<br /><br />In summary, stay away from \\"The Clone Wars\\", enjoy the 2003 series \\"Clone Wars\\"
B0011UBDTK|5.0|I've only gotten through a few dvds but if you're a fan, you'll need all of the episodes. The packing is cute and functional. I like the way it sits in it's on book. I'll never get tired of watching them! I can't wait to see the extras!
8590379825|5.0|I think this book is a \\"must have\\" if you are involved in Lua scripting. It covers almost every aspect of Lua programming from basics to advanced topics. Maybe a little of confusion may arise when reading the chapters related to the fundamental topics such as iterators and tables, because the author lifts up the limit going deeper in to the explanation. But I think that this is a merit and not an obstacle, because at every level what the author writes about the topic let you use Lua even if you have not understood the whole topic yet; furthermore the author always points out pros and odds of the examples code.  You can use the book both as a starting guide and as a reference book.
B001F290E4|2.0|First, let me put this in context.  I think Seal has one of the best voices in pop music today.  I love most of his CDs.  This CD, unfortunately, is a complete misfire.  I tried to think about how I could condense the problem in a few statements.  It comes down to 3 things:    1.  The original songs have already been performed at such an extraordinary level of artistic performance by the original artists, that it's going to be tough to out perform them here.     2.  The arrangements are just lackluster and completely boring.  Seal's voice can't fix that problem.  Listening to this CD was like hanging out in the waiting room at the doctor's office.    3.  Seal's interpretation of these songs is so uniteresting and so \\"middle of the road\\", that I found myself switching the display on the time counter on the CD player to see how much longer the track would last.      I really love his voice, but this is incredibly boring.
6304711905|5.0|Love the DVD. My VCR tape finally wore out. I can really understand the words better- much clearer than the tape.   This is a must have in every home if you like a good action packed movie that has serious moments, good laughs and great lines about how to think about life and living in it.  Val Kilmer, Kurt Russell and Sam Elliott at their best.
B000AYEL6U|5.0|Elizabeth Gaskell, who wrote the book in the early 1800s that this movie is based on, is an exciting find for fans of Charles Dickens and Jane Austen. She treats all of her characters with humor and compassion, and this movie is a moving adaptation of her work. Beautiful and historically accurate costuming. This movie is a new favorite.

Besides the fact that the DVD cover is made with a very, very, nice, steel finish, you also get a bonus digital copy of the film that you can download to your I-pod or MP3 player with video capability. The special features appear identical to the regular 2-Disc Special Editions, so get yours now before the leeches put them on Ebay or Amazon for extra $$$$!
B001ED7C58|3.0|i haven't purchased the soundtrack yet but i did listen to all of the clips and read some reviews today. i do agree it seems a little too poppy and upbeat for the type of movie. there should be more dark romantic songs maybe. i'm not quite sure but i haven't completely passed judgement. anyways, i wanted to recommend that you all check out Twilight: The score. it comes out in december i believe, and is all classical. this may satisfy what we had in our minds of appropriate music after reading the books. (i've yet to hear it of course, i was just throwing an idea out there.)
B001GQSY5U|5.0|This movie embodies everything that was once great about the Star Wars universe: Adventure, Action, Serial-Style Drama and Witty Characters.<br /><br />I avoided this movie in the theaters until there was nothing left to see, so I gave it a try and was blown away. The story is great and the fantastic animation really makes the universe more believable.<br /><br />Even the new Padowan isn't annoying, she actually provides mroe than just comic relief or brat-like attitude. I really think the saving grace of this film was leaving out the original cast and bringing in approximal voice actors who do a great job at conveying the emotion and wit while keeping a semblance of the film actors performances.<br /><br />Definitely worth a purchase, get ready for Star Wars the old-fashioned way.
0312427999|5.0|If you thought you knew about America, and it's foreign policy for the past 50 years, wait 'til you read this book.

0450040186|3.0|This book couldve been so much better had a lot of inane detail been left out.  It could be trimmed down to one third of its size and it would flow so much better and be so much scarier.  Okay, so maybe that wouldnt make for an impressive wordy volume, but it would certainly maintain the creepy mood.  Read The Masque of The Red Death by Poe and compare the two stories.  King even refers to Poe's short story in his book a few times.  I wish I could say The Shining was scary, but for me, it wasnt.
B001CLG6RC|1.0|Bought ENIGMA \\"Seven Lives Many Faces\\" (2008) CD and placed the CD into my computer and got an AVG Anti-Virus program warning that it found a Trojan Horse Downloader.Generic8.BGR in the CD's EnigmaStarter.exe. This rating is only about the Capitol Records' part of it, not the artist's.    For the artist's part I'd give it 3 1/2 stars. How many artists can create super hit albums year after year? Not many if at all. Be realistic.

B000PC0U1W|4.0|Wonderful entertaining movie.  Simple political analogies weigh the movie down. I believe in tolerance not forced recognition. Problem is the downtrodden thrive to turn the tables rather then line then up evenly. Fire for fire.  Violence for violence.  Revenge is the function of vendetta.  Ultimately this movie fails in its noble cause but works as a source of entertainment.
B001GKJ2DO|4.0|Let's get this out of the way at the beginning.....I was never really an ABBA fan, from the beginning. I managed to miss every touring company that played LA, though I would have loved to see and hear Judy Kaye as one of the friends in the original Broadway production.  Now there's another incredible actress singer treading the boards.  But I was lucky enough to have seen Meryl Streep sing on stage (her brilliant version of Surabaya Johnny from HAPPY END on Broadway in the late 70's beat Bette Midler's version recorded around that time).  And that teaser at the end of POSTCARDS FROM THE EDGE....c'mon, the woman is a national treasure.<br /><br />So I saw the previews.....take me to that island right away.  Certainly a total rip off of BUONA SERRA, MRS CAMPBELL, but set in Greece.  And a chick flick?  Chicks over 45.....don't forget they are still alive and vibrant.  And Streep, Baranski and Walters lay it on with gusto, joy and lots of fun.  In fact, that's what I liked most about the film: everyone seemed to be having a good time.  And what's the problem with Brosnan's singing?  Does everyone have to sound like Pavarotti?  I think everyone brought a sense of play and fun and romance to a pretty thin script.<br /><br />And what was wrong with the long line dances on piers and patios?  Anyone caught the Rockettes lately?<br /><br />It's a musical aimed at the over 40 set, and I had a terrific time in the Mediterranean sun for a couple of hours.  And I will definitely get the film to re-enjoy it all.  So TAKE THAT all you grinches out there.
0061537934|5.0|I enjoyed this book very much.  Having the dog tell the story made for some interesting interpretations of what was going on.  Very well written!  With an ending that makes you wonder.
B000SMWUPS|5.0|I purchased this organizer to go onto my little Combi stroller.  It is basically an umbrella stroller that folds in thirds into itself.  I bought this thinking that I'd have to take it on and off everytime that I used it, but that would be okay because I wanted something that would hold it's shape better than a hanging bag with a drink pouch.  I was pleasantly surprised that I don't have to remove it, it bends just enough to fold with the stroller, but is still firm enough to hold my pop without swinging and splashing.  Very important for a Cherry Pepsi-aholic!  It also holds keys, cell, pacifier, and sippy cup just perfect!  It's great!

0385340990|5.0|\\"Breathtaking\\" and \\"literally\\" are words overused and frequently misapplied, but I found that THE GUERNSEY LITERARY AND POTATO PEEL PIE SOCIETY literally took my breath away: I was so engrossed that I forgot to breathe.<br /><br />This is a fairly small book, yet it deals with more issues than some encyclopedias.<br /><br />Though I had heard, of course, of the Channel Islands and Jersey and Guernsey, I never knew much about them, nor had I been curious to learn more. That has changed for me.  And I had had no idea that Guernsey had been occupied by the Nazis during World War II, or that its inhabitants had been treated as harshly as those in any small town in France, Belgium and Holland that had fallen in the path of the Germany army.<br /><br />The story is told in the form of a series of letters. I can recall this format being used successfully only twice in the past: In A WOMAN OF INDEPENDENT MEANS as well as in 84, CHARING CROSS ROAD. (In fact, there are a number of similarities between the latter and THE GUERNSEY... SOCIETY. Each book deals, in part, with World War II London and all this implies in terms of rationing and the Blitz, and also with the overlapping worlds of book-publishing and book selling.) The book also contains overtones of that much-loved BBC comedy, THE VICAR OF DIBLEY.<br /><br />The plot begins innocently enough, describing town life on a small British island. Yet with as many layers as a large onion, the obvious surface keeps being peeled back to reveal ever more complicated and disturbing information.<br /><br />To mention all of the many themes addressed, then, would read like a list. Suffice it to say that love and romance are included, but also the worst human depravity in history, the way in which the Nazis treated their victims. Even in this bestiality, however, the authors -- like poor Anne Frank -- were able to see some good and some beauty inherent in the human race.<br /><br />This is a quick book to read, which is a good thing, because I don't imagine that its readers will want to put it down before having finished it.want to put it down before having finished it.
B00192KCQ0|5.0|It comes really fast, well wrapped and really coooooooool. I've never seen this album in this price!! excellent :)
0375826726|4.0|I had no idea that so many people hated this book until I read all these 1-2 star reviews. It wasn't the best of the series, but it was all right.  Many people have complained about the gore. But if Brisingr were made into a movie, it would be so much more bloody. I have seen plenty of bloody movies and read plenty of bloody books, and they were a lot worse. Although it was a bit much at times, it didn't give me nightmares or make me think morbid thoughts.   I was happy to find out that Brom was Eragon's father, not that I hadn't suspected it. Paolini strayed off the path that Star Wars set, and the revelation mostly came as a suprise.  I liked the parts from the dragons point-of-view. It proved their inhuman-ness, in a good way.  Some parts frustrated me though. Roran went from hating killing to slaughtering 200 men in an hour. In the middle, the dwarf politics dragged forever. And nothing happened between Eragon and Arya.  Overall, though, I enjoyed the book and I will buy the fourth one happily.
0375826726|2.0|I, like many others, eagerly awaited what was to be a thrilling tale of magic, dragons, and merciless plajorism of Star Wars and Lord of the Rings.  I even found the book while I was in Budapest, for goodness sake (just to put my devotion in perspective!).    Well, I was totally jazzed when I was almost immediately rewarded with some healthy blood and gore in the course of enemy slashing.  I read on, waiting another thrilling plot development....    700 pages later, I was brutally disappointed.  I like character development as much as the next person, but not when we dispose of insignificant things like, um, THE PLOT, to do it.  Why on Earth Paolini decided that he HAD to have a four book series is beyond me.  The characters were already a tad flat - all Paolini really accomplished in this book was glue a few cliched problems to every character, give them ALL magical immunities, and fail to reward us with some well earned plot arc.    I await the fourth book.  I pray that it has a plot, and Galbatorix doesn't turn out to be a misunderstood, moody sorcerer who lost his mind when trying to provide for the poor.
B000ZK4466|1.0|Eclectic banality for masturbating the ear drums (a compendium of TMV LP's 1,2&3)<br /><br />If you like TMV, you like them up, you like them down. Here's a list of reasons not to be over-enthused about this album, and possibly save yourself 5-15 greenbacks for what otherwise costs a google search and 10mins download time.<br /><br />TRACK SYNOPSIS<br /><br />1. Aberinkula: Cedric's has been converted by the Beegee school of singing, Tetragrammaton is here to stay. The last 3mins are very funky, but it sounds much too similar to Asclepius later on.<br /><br />2. ORL has stated in interviews that ALL their songs follow the basic 'pop' structure: it becomes obvious here to the detriment of the song, since this happens to be one of their strongest longer pieces despite itself, this is unfortunate.<br /><br />3. 1 trick l'via pony that the Mars Volta has become. Sure to become a dance club favorite, great lyrics; the only rhythmically engaging track besides Agadez on the whole album. Again, the rhythm section makes this band now.<br /><br />4. Wax Simalcra. A great single. Makes the rest of the album sound like a B side (it is, in a sense, given the production 'problems' surrounding the album. A cousin of Viscera Eyes in a good sense.<br /><br />5. Goliath. Not \\"influenced\\" by King Crimson, but a very cheap footnote to 21st century Schizoid Man. 1 riff over 8 minutes with solos that do not even merit the name \\"atonal\\"; apparently the Ouija board spirits were also archaic despisers of Jazz and saw it fit to remove any reference to those sections of the said KG tune. The version on \\"Se Bisonte, No Buffalo\\" is much better (and slower for that matter.)<br /><br />6. Tourniquet Man. \\"Let me be . . .\\" This is straight out of the Spinal Tap playbook. Disgusting and boring. Ominous enough to make you giggle.<br /><br />7. Cavalettas. A great 40 sec. or so piano that manages to get its head above the water later in the dozing of into noise 5 minute ending. An overproduced punk piece. Fail.<br /><br />8. Agadez. --The bassist writes his own part. It becomes a more interesting track than any other on the album and goes through the most changes in their live set, also being *ironically* one of Omar's favorites of the album.<br /><br />9. Askepios. Greek/Egyptian god of medicine. It achieves Spinal Tap in a tolerably sinister way that gives out to a poppy breakdown, once again, fueled only by the bassist & drummer, bs guitar interspersed. Again, ominous giggles.<br /><br />10. Ouroborous. Ouroboros. The symbol for eternity, and in Jungian psychology, for narcissism. A sick hybrid of the Claymore section of L'via, parts of Cicatriz sped up, with the general outline and feel of Viscera Eyes though less list-enable given the inertiatic esp/haunt of roulette dares tempo and rhythmic articulation. Interesting but nothing but an amalgam of past tricks. (Some will say \\"Originality has only itself to imitate.\\" Very well.  This is a group that prides itself on drawing on influences and synthesizing; this reviewer leaves that antimony for someone else to gawk and gloss over.)<br /><br />11. Soothsayer. Overproduced piece originally arranged for an acoustic quintet (possibly more). Again, brief moments of insight turned into torpid repetition; pleasantly soporific at best. This is no \\"Kasmir\\" by any stretch of the imagination. 11 minutes.<br /><br />12. See track 6. \\"I've gotaPENthatcan rip the very fabric of time . . .\\" In otherwords, SPINAL TAP. --On, second thought, they stuck to booty wisecracks poking fun at the 13 year old mentality embodied in fanboys and the hip rocking manboys they idolize and imitate; they did not descend to the level of outright D**K jokes.  Haw haw, the joke is on us apparently.<br /><br />*This band's greatest achievements were accomplished with the help of Flea and Rick Rubin's professionalism. If they do not show some restraint and discipline in the upcoming \\"acoustic LP\\" it safe to say that this band is going the way of YES once Chris Squire and Rick Wakemen left, or the Mahavishnu Orchestra once Jan Hammer left. Self-indulgence does not = authenticity or naturalism, but only permissive mediocrity and decadence. The more this band extends itself, the less force they bring to their work; Thomas Prigen is a quantitative injection that cannot make up for the lack of coherent and sustained Thought in the Mars Volta's last two offerings.does not = authenticity or naturalism, but only permissive mediocrity and decadence.

0060555661|5.0|Take a deep breath.  If there was ever a time to sit back and revisit some of Benjamin Graham's sage advice, this is it.  Just this weekend the Wall Street Journal reported that in the ten years ended 12/31/07, the Dow never saw a 9% trading range within a single day.  This year it has happened six times.   What would Graham think of today's volatility?  I wouldn't be so presumptuous to put words into his mouth, but if I had to guess, I think he would assert that there are pockets of opportunity for the enterprising investor who adheres to Graham's three elements of investing.      While not as academic as Security Analysis, The Intelligent Investor still does a remarkable job of explaining fundamental investment analysis concepts:  risk management, valuation, investment versus speculation, margin of safety, and asset allocation, among others.  But most impressive is the fact that the man who taught Warren Buffet about investing manages to discuss highly technical concepts in plain English, while leveraging case studies and unusual market events from the first half of the 20th century to add a sense of realism to theory.  All of this makes the book an enjoyable and instructive read, and you can take the history lesson as an added bonus.        Another invaluable benefit of this edition is Jason Zweig's commentary throughout the book. After every chapter, Zweig presents a 21st century point of view, relating concepts and historical examples in the text to situations faced by today's companies.  Some of the most outrageous examples from current times involve bankrupt and de-listed internet companies, and comments by management, analysts, and members of the financial press that are astonishing in retrospect.  Zweig also does an outstanding job in the footnotes - elaborating on Graham's concepts or explaining dated material in the text that today's reader may not understand - from long forgotten stories of financial scandal to observations about Manhattan architecture.The Intelligent Investor is a must read for anyone thinking of going into finance or currently employed in the industry.  In a market where many asset managers seem to have abandoned basic analysis and sound due diligence in pursuit of a short cut to outsized (and ultimately unsustainable) returns, you might want to ask your advisor if he has read any or Graham's works.  And if the answer is no, perhaps you should find someone who has.
0141439831|4.0|I read Vanity Fair because it was the only English book available and because I had a lot of time on my hands.  Had I been encompassed about by the demands and stresses of everyday life, I would never have made it through this novel.  Its plot unfolds slowly and methodically.  In this way, it is very unlike modern fiction.  Characters are given hundreds of pages filled with everyday encounters to evolve, rather than a short, speedy novel with a plot that races by.  In order to enjoy the pace of the book, it's necessary to take time to read it.  It is not one to be consumed in a few days, though I'm sure it can be.  Rather, let the events unfold in pieces, as they were meant to.    There is a level of social commentary and satire in Makepeace-Thackeray's masterpiece that I have never found in another book.  It takes the entire book to decide who you are rooting for to rise in the hierarchy of Victorian England.  In the end, I decided I was rooting for them all to fail, which gives life to the subtitle of the book: \\"a novel without a hero\\".  There is time to discover the many faults of all the various characters.  Different though they may be, in the end, none of them deserve the status they long for.  And maybe that's the point: status above others is something that no one \\"deserves\\".    Though I admit that this book is slow-paced and not always easy to get through, don't let this discourage you from reading it.  It is an absolute gem of wit and irony.  The two girls it mainly follows, privileged Amelia who has fallen from her financial throne, and spunky Becky, who is willing to claw, connive and marry her way to the top, represent such different philosophies on life.  The book manages to record the lives of some dozen other less important characters as well.  This leads to the illusion of really knowing the lives of Amelia and Becky: their youthful mishaps, life-long acquaintances, and final fates.  Vanity Fair is as intricate a novel as one could hope for, and itis well worth the effort it takes to read it.
B00004XMTJ|5.0|I love this musical, I saw it for the first time when I was 8, now I'm 18 and I still love to watch it! It is exactly how I remember, but much clearer, I would recommend it to previous viewers and to families with young children.
B001GAPC1K|5.0|Ironman lives up to the hype with an excellent updating of the story and quite good character development. There is a humanity brought to the character that makes the story fantastic yet somehow believable...
B00005JPFH|5.0|This movie gets a lot of hate, which it does NOT deserve. Sure it did not live up to the hype, but nothing could ever match the expectations set for this film.    However, it was still very entertaining, it had great special effects, great story, great acting and fits perfectly with the first two.   Everytime I'm sick and stay home from work, I watch all three back to back and love every minute of each film.   There are many comic book films out there that trully deserve a lot of hate, Catwoman for example, but Spidey 3 is not one of them! The people bashing it are simple and narrow minded or like to complain about everything. It is important to keep in mind that Spider-man's main audience is made up of kids under 13, so making the film dark (like the new batman movies) would be stupid. Sure there are many real problems that each character has to face, and some themes are trully grusome, like the murder of Uncle Ben, but at the end, the movie leaves you with a better attitude and improves your day and may be even your entire personality.
1596060832|5.0|Interesting read if you're a fan of Peter Beagle and know the OTHER version of this story.  It's pretty interesting to see how it progressed from this to what he orignally published.
B000BTGY1O|2.0|The movie is a classic, just a bad one. It's been a while since I've seen it, but the other reviews really helped jog my memory. The movie was  shallow and contrived. The main character of a movie should be liked by the audience, but Holly failed to catch my attention or respect. Her unhappiness and lack of self confidence is no excuse for her selfishness. I might have given this move a 3 star if not for the hype. The over the top praise this movie has recieved is unbelievable! I can't help being disappointed in the people who gave it a 5 star. Everyone is entitled to their opinion, but still. I agree with a reviewer who wrote that Breakfast at Tiffany's is so beloved because Audrey Hepburn is in it and because the movie is in color. It's pretty irritating that some people would judge a movie by it's actors and CGI, color, cinematography, etc. Shouldn't the story have some kind of plot or lesson? I guess that I'm just the type of person who likes a movie with a purpose. I don't need symbolism, just some kind of goal in mind. Maybe I need to learn how to enjoy a movie for what it is instead of analyzing everything. Actually, I'm not even sure why I watched it in the first place. Curiosity, I guess, and I felt that I should since I like watching classics. It really wasn't a terrible movie, just disappointing. And also, like another reviewer said, it felt like the beginning of Hollywood's apathetic or \\"whatever-floats-your-boat\\" phase.
B0015FML06|5.0|\\"Under A Blood Red Sky\\" was my introduction to live U2 about 25 years ago.  I had a copy of a copy that was passed around in my circle of friends, we used to actually fight over who was going to get it next and for how long.  Since then I've been a huge U2 fan and will be for life. U2's music (especially live) has inspired me in many ways. U2 is truely one of the most unique bands to have ever played and to still be playing live. I highly recomend this live performance. It is awe inspiring to say the least. Go out and get some U2!
0937381888|5.0|Great book, good price, fast professional service. Getting ready to make some brew. How dry I am.
0761129235|5.0|Great book! Why?<br /><br />1. If you have the time, can be read in one sitting (I'd estimate 1-3 hrs, depending on how fast you read).<br /><br />2. Focuses on how kaizen works at the individual level. The majority of the examples are business-related, and a few examples are included that illustrate how to use kaizen to address personal goals such as addiction or weight loss.<br /><br />3. Clear, brief explanation of the role of the brain and why kaizen works with the brain.<br /><br />4. Good format - each chapter is summarized and includes key points as well as recommendations/instructions.<br /><br />Based on the amount of time required/cost of book, this is a great value. A practical choice for busy people; also serves as a good companion for longer business texts on continuous improvement.
B001DTPZNY|3.0|I liked the movie but it only had about 1 good action scene.  It seemed very scripted and not at all like the old Indiana movies.  Descent movie just wasn't the same for me.

B001GKJ2DO|5.0|I COULD CARE LESS WHAT REVIEWERS THOUGHT OF THIS MOVIE, PUT ASIDE ANY PROBLEMS THEY MAY OR MAY NOT HAVE HAD THIS WAS A FIST CLASS MOVIE FROM THE OPENING SCENE TILL THE ENDING. THE MUSIC, THE DANCING, THE JIVING, MERYL, PIERCE, THE REST OF THE CAST MIX AND MINGLE TOGETHER LIKE THEY ARE HAVING THE TIME OF THEIR LIVES.  COLIN FIRTH IS A TOTAL DREAM BUCKET IN THIS ROLE, HE PLAYS IT TO THE TEE. MY GOSH AFTER SEEING THE MOVIE 8 TIMES YOU FALL IN LOVE WITH PIERCE'S VOICE, IT BECOMES SEXY. MY DAUGHTER AND I HAVE SEEN THIS MOVIE OVER AND OVER AND HAVE BEEN BREATHLESSLY AWAITING THE RELEASE DATE FOR THE DVD. WE AND THE AUDIENCE SING AND DANCE IN OUR SEATS.  WHEN THEY CAME OUT WITH THE SING-ALONG VERSION, WE WERE LIKE SCHOOLGIRLS WITH A CRUSH AND I'M 50. I LOVED THE COURTYARD SCENE BECAUSE THIS IS WHERE THERE START TO SING S.O.S.!!!! IF YOUR A FAN OF THE MUSIC OF ABBA PLEASE TAKE THE TIME AND HAVE THE TIME OF YOUR LIFE.  THIS MOVIE MADE OUR SUMMER OF 08' AWESOME. PLUS WE WERE ABLE TO SEE THE LIVE VERSION IN LAS VEGAS, THAT WAS A BONUS!!!    PJM IN KINGMAN, AZ

B000YXMMAE|5.0|Radiohead is a band who's releases continue to remain solid throughout over a decade of songwriting.  While other bands dwindle in their creativity, they keep it up with every album.  Every song on this album is great.  \\"Nude\\" and \\"Reckoner\\" are two that practically give me a religious experience when I hear them.  To call this album just \\"good\\" would be a devastating understatement and would rob Radiohead of their genius.
B00192KCQ0|5.0|This album exceeds all expectations.  I won't go into detail, but on track 7, around the 5:30 mark, the intensity of the music reaches a new high, imo.  It reminds me of the early Metallica music, only better!  Even if you aren't a big Metallica fan, you'll enjoy the heck out of this album. I sure wish their tour included NC.  Anyone with connections, pull some strings, please. hee.
B001F0VHEM|3.0|I've liked most every album Pink has put out, not every song, but a lot of songs on those albums. I bought the whole CD of Funhouse because I tend to like her songs that never get very popular or get played on radio like 18 Wheeler and Misery from M!ssundaztood or Nobody Knows and Who Knew. Songs that display her strong voice without all the gimmicky touches some of her other songs have. Don't get me wrong, though...I love Don't Let Me Get Me & Just Like A Pill too, just not as much. This CD is no where near as strong as M!ssundastood was but a little less strong than I'm Not Dead. Four songs seem to stand out for me, though I'm sure others will be popular. The songs \\"I Don't Believe You\\", \\"One Foot Wrong\\", \\"Please Don't Leave Me\\" & \\"Mean\\" to me are the best songs on the CD (Tracks 3,4,5 & 9). \\"I Don't Believe You\\" especially captures her vocals in their best light. It's a very strong, emotional, lyrical, melodic ballad. It's old school vocals and melody show her to still have a great voice and nobody's pretender. \\"Mean\\" is another good, strong no non-sense song that shows off her voice. The other two tracks; \\"One Foot Wrong\\", \\"Please Don't Leave Me\\" are a step down from the first two I mentioned, and the rest of the tracks are on one more step down. She still has an amazing voice and can really belt out some good music when she's got the right material, I just wish there was more of that on this CD. Worth getting for $10, though.
B001DDBCUK|5.0|Even if you didn't watch the tv series, you will really enjoy this movie.  The women are still their awesome selves, the clothes are off the charts and then there is The City!  What a great representation this movie gives of NYC.  Just plan to enjoy the movie a lot!
B001EO2UJK|4.0|This past year has been a well-celebrated year for Genesis. With the reunion tour of the trio of Phil Collins, Mike Rutherford and Tony Banks, Genesis really proved that even with time, they still had a lot that was worth celebrating. But, before Phil was the lead, there was Peter Gabriel. Back in the 60's and 70's, Gabriel brought in his clever and imaginative storytelling that gave Genesis their hard-core following that has continued to this day. While Peter hasn't performed with his bandmates in years, many have been anxious about hoping that Genesis returns to its original form. But that could also be said as a new reintroduction to the beginnings of Genesis and Peter Gabriel too on this latest Genesis box set.<br /><br />Genesis 1970-1975 is the final chapter in the trilogy of Genesis boxed sets. While we've seen later records like Duke, Invisible Touch and Trick Of The Tail re-released last year, this collection showcases the groups humble beginnings, with rare footage from Gabriel's influence that shaped him in his later solo triumphs and Genesis too. The box set includes the rare classics albums that finally get re-released to the public, after being out-of-print for so many years, The elusive Lamb Lies Down On Broadway, Nursery Crime, Foxtrot, Selling England By The Pound, and the beginnings with Phil Collins and Steve Hackett on Trespass.<br /><br />The songs have all been restored beautifully, and bring in a fresh and invigorating life to the cult following Genesis had in the early 70's. There are a lot of great songs here that sound better than ever including I Know What I Like (In Your Wardrobe), the dark and dormid Watcher Of The Skies, Back In N.Y.C., the epic storytelling from Supper's Ready, and very rare never-before heard recording of haunting tracks like Twilight Alehouse and live recordings from the BBC and from a live performance in Jackson like Frustration and Manipulation. Still, there are a few disadvantages to the boxed set. One of the biggest is that it doesn't highlight in anyway their original debut album From Genesis To Revelation with original founding member Anthony Phillips. Another disadvantage is that I honestly was hoping for some more interviews with Peter from when he originally fronted Genesis.<br /><br />All in all, Genesis 1970-1975 still is a great buy for original hard-core Genesis fans, but I was honestly hoping for a little bit more. Also, I also am dissapointed that those Peter Gabriel era albums won't be available individually in the record stores until sometime next year. But, for those who can't wait it is worth hearing these deep and dark sonnets all over again. So turn Peter's Lamb on again, and know that Supper is still ready with Genesis 1970-1975.<br /><br />Album Cover: B<br /><br />Songs: B+<br /><br />Price: B-<br /><br />Remastering: A-<br /><br />DVD Extras: B-<br /><br />Overall: Bdoesn't highlight in anyway their original debut album From Genesis To Revelation with original founding member Anthony Phillips.

0930289234|5.0|\\"Watchmen\\" is not only an incredible graphic novel, but also an incredible piece of literary work. The characters are amazingly multi-faceted, and are developed throughout the story with an unparalleled sense of humanity and realism. This is a story about superheroes, yet after reading this you will question what it is to be a hero at all. An obvious amount of care, thought, and dedication was put into this work, and after reading it you will feel as if you have just realized something profound about our human race as a whole. A thought-provoking masterwork. You will never read anything else like \\"Watchmen\\".
B001F290E4|3.0|It has been over a year since Seal came out with his last record, the shallow and dissapointing System. While his personal life has been well celebrated with his marriage to supermodel Heidi Klum, and fatherhood, he has yet to redeliver the status of his bold and soulful voice to that next generation who seems to be more into wannabe acts like Jordin Sparks and American Idol contendors David Cook and David Archletta. Still, he has decided to try something a bit different to get his voice started all over again. But, with his new approach for going back to basics, is this really a worthwhile album, or just another album that dissapoints music listeners everywhere?<br /><br />Seal's first full-length cover album, Soul, brings his distinctive voice into classic R&B and Soul covers from classics from the 50's, 60's and 70's. While there are some covers that work well that bring his style well like A Change Is Gonna Come, his simple rendition of Ben E. King's standard Stand by Me, and the soulful late James Brown on It's A Man's World that bring some chemistry into Seal and these songs, other ones like his cover Of Harold Melvin & The Blue Notes If You Don't Know Me By Now feels more like it is weak and tries to redeliver the splice from when Simply Red did the cover back in 1989, and the cover of Curtis Mayfield's People Get Ready lacks the essence that made Curtis a strength in influencing R&B.<br /><br />All in all, Seal's Soul is not as distinctive to hard core fans as his 90's era brought so much joy from the days he used to swoon people from Kiss From A Rose and Prayer From The Dying. While it is not a complete waste to listen to, it just could've been so much more for Seal to showcase on the album to please his fans, and those who've yet to hear any one of his great songs.<br /><br />Album Cover: B<br /><br />Songs: C 1/2-<br /><br />Price: C<br /><br />Mastering: C+<br /><br />Overall: C
1401216676|5.0|The Killing Joke was a comic spawned shortly after the work of Frank Miller, and is probably the comic that established The Joker as one of the most important fictional villains of the 20th century.  Batman had become a well thought out, complex character in recent years, primarily due to the work of skilled writer Frank Miller.  Batman had been brought into a gritty, modern world of comic books, but I always felt that Miller's The Dark Knight Returns failed to bring the antagonistic Joker into a new light...well it did, but not in the way the character was meant to be.  Alan Moore, with the help of Brian Bolland's stunning artwork helped bring to life what is widely accepted as today's standard for the famous Harlequin of Hate.<br /><br />He's crazy, he kills people simply for his own twisted sense of humor, but always has a very zany, cartoonish attitude, which I felt was lacking in Miller's interpretation, where Joker seemed much too serious in appearance, dialogue, and action.  The Joker presented in this graphic novel truly is a fiendish jester of fate, who for the most part is truly frightening, but never really acts like anything more than a loon.  Bolland's art is very helpful in this aspect, not only bringing the Joker's exaggerated, skeletal body to life, but making it perhaps the most anatomically correct Joker ever seen, while still following the style of the 1970s Joker appearances.<br /><br />The story revolves around the long struggle between Batman and his foe, and their never ending conflict.  Joker, having escaped from Arkham Asylum (again), has decided to prove that one bad day can transform any sane man into a monster, such as himself.  Taking possession of an old carnival he's ready to do whatever it takes to prove his point, with the assistance of a circus freak show.  Meanwhile The Dark Knight questions himself on how this fight will end; coming to the realization that sooner or later one of them would kill the other, unless they tried to reason it out.  A hopeless plan by our hero, but he has to at least try a single time to reason with his arch-nemesis, just so he can say he tried.<br /><br />While Batman leads the hunt for the psychotic clown, Joker decides to prove his theory, kidnapping Commissioner Gordon, and shooting Barbara Gordon (Batgirl) through the spine (she never walks again).  This is one of the most villainous acts in the history of comics; simply because of how pointless the shooting was, considering Barbara wasn't even in the character of Batgirl.  She was just a bystander who Joker decided to use as a tool for his plot.  Everyone is a puppet, or tool in his mind.<br /><br />He does this act all of this while wearing a stereotypical beach-going tourist's attire, complete with a large camera, the only exception being his wide-brimmed, purple hat, which conceal his eyes.  These are the eyes of a madman, and in one of the comic's final pages his eyes are concealed in shadow once again, before they come out and you see him for the hopeless case he truly is.<br /><br />The story sets the stage for the most widely accepted Joker back-story through a series of flashbacks, showing him as a failed comedian with a pregnant wife, and soon winds up assisting criminals, and falling victim to tragedy.  The character is shown to have had one bad day and that is how he ended up as the smiling super villain who has plagued Gotham City for decades.  Of course this back-story isn't necessarily true, being that it comes from flashbacks spawned from Joker's mind, and as he famously states in his confrontation with Batman \\"If I'm going to have a past, I prefer it to be multiple choice!\\"<br /><br />Gordon's capture and torture leads to a fight between these two iconic characters, where Batman tries to see if it is possible to reason with Joker logically, but the villain doesn't even try to lie about what is obviously in store for them.  He can never be reasoned with, and won't stop until he's dead, and Batman refuses to kill him so it's a sick cycle that goes round and round.  In the end of The Killing Joke the roller coaster has only been reset and it will only be a matter of time before Joker is back on the streets, killing again with some new, random scheme which will only make sense to him alone, depending on the mood he's in at the time, or which version of his past he remembers.<br /><br />Alan Moore's story is sick, it's disturbing, and doesn't fail to leave the reader in a state of awe.  The only problem is that by the end you crave for more!  The story practically brings you to the point of begging for a sequel, or expansion which will probably never come.  This is a one-shot story, and should remain that way, or else the original's impact may be lost.  I don't have a single friend who doesn't think The Killing Joke is one of the most twisted, sick, most perfect stories of the comic medium.  It's short, but it delivers a powerful punch!<br /><br />Brian Bolland's art makes this short graphic novel a masterpiece, providing some of the best art ever seen in the characters' long history, only rivaled (in my opinion) by the art of Alex Ross.  Joker really is frightening to look at here, because he doesn't look like a real person in most aspects, but Bolland manages to make this character incredibly believable in appearance, without taking any liberties of changing the body type into something more universal.  The tall, skeletal body of the 1970s comics is preserved for the most part, except for the narrowing of the chin, which improves the look even further (hence why it's universally used in today's comics).<br /><br />Recently I got the hardcover anniversary edition of The Killing Joke, with the artwork being edited by Brian Bolland, and re-colored by Bolland personally the way he intended it to be seen.  I must say that I love the changes to the colors, more so than the cheery, bright colors of the original, which I felt distracted from Bolland's line-art, because the colors were way too traditional comic book, not fitting the intensity of the art.  These colors are dark, gritty, and really captures to mood of the story more effectively than the bright colors of the original release.  I especially love the flashbacks being in black and white, except for concentrating on objects that reflect the color red, which leads up to him taking on the garb of The Red Hood, before his first confrontation, leading to his ultimate disfigurement and insanity.  This is a seriously talented artist and I only wish he was presented with more opportunities to draw these characters.  Batman and Joker look their very best in these images, and I'd be hard pressed to find a comic with better consistency of art quality.<br /><br />The Killing Joke is one, if not THE best story in the history of Batman comics, and rightfully earns my rating of 10/10 stars.e that goes round and round.  In the end of The Killing Joke the roller coaster has only been reset and it will only be a matter of time before Joker is back on the streets, killing again with some new, random scheme which will only make sense to him alone, depending on the mood he's in at the time, or which version of his past he remembers.

044022425X|5.0|Gabaldon's series just keeps getting better and better. I was ENTRALLED with this book. This one had more twists and turns than the previous novels. There was a skull found by Claire that had me wondering \\"Who was it?\\"  This was found out later in the book, the seperation of Brianna and Roger, and the things that happened to him in the hands of the Mohawk.     I do admit that there were slow parts of the book, as in the previous ones but, for me, that is part of the reason that makes these books so appealing...she sets the scenes up, takes the reader to the mid-eighteenth century and makes one envision how North Carolina might have looked during that time. I've been to South Carolina and Charleston and can easitly see without much effort how the town and surrounding countryside might have looked back then.     Gibaldon is quite discriptive so it is just as easy to imagine the scenery with my mind as it was in real life.     Just like Jamie, although not as badly, she puts Roger through the mill as well. He is tested in his love for Brianna. I won't say whether he comes through or not, I'll let any future readers find out for themselves, but I do feel for the poor man.     I am looking forward to starting THE FIERY CROSS now. Drums only left me wanting more. As one reviewer stated, start from the beginning. Even though each book does give you snippets of what occurs in previous books and it's possible to read them alone, it is better if you begin with Outlander and continue from there.
B001E5FYS8|5.0|I was lured into seeing this film by my teenage son, who is a circus acrobat by genetic conviction as surely as Philippe Petit was a high-wire walker and as I am a musician. I would never have entered the theater if I'd known what I'd be seeing. I have a pathologically empathetic response to films. When I was a little kid, I used to shout out warnings to Tweetie Bird when the cat got near. During fight scenes, my whole body twitches and my wife gets nervous for the safety of the unsuspecting head in front of me. I'm a climber in real life. I've been to the summit of Annapurna. But my blood pressure rises and I tremble with acrophobia at Hollywood simulations of climbing. This film Man on Wire took two years off my life, I'm sure. It's that intense, with its coy intersplicing of still photos and super-eight footage of Petit in mid-air and lovely slow talking-head interviews of Petit and his accomplices, years later, clearly establishing that they all survived to tell the tale.<br /><br />Those interviews of middle-aged daredevils, reminiscing about their greatest caper, were as intense for me as the dodgy accomplishment of the adventure. It was literally the end of a love affair with life for all of them, something \\"too hot not to cool down,\\" an overture too overwhelming to be followed by a mere opera. When Petit's boyhood friend broke down in tears at the waning of their friendship, when Petit's wife-the-love-of-his-life felt the reality that his life no longer needed hers, the whole social cost of Petit's obsession moved me also almost to tears. Hey, I might have cried if my heart had slowed down to twice normal. I felt an urge to grab my son and hug or shake him, saying \\"don't let your art be more to you than your life.\\"<br /><br />There's more to this film than a mere victimless heist thriller.
B001E95ZNI|4.0|This was reportedly a labor of love for director Harris and it clearly shows in this intelligent production that has something for everyone, action, humor, great characters. My lady friend(not given to violence in film)enjoyed the costumes and the relationship between Zelwegger and Harris and the questions it presented. I am a fan of good westerns and will be adding this one to the home library when it becomes available.
B001GKJ2DO|5.0|I have now seen this movie 7 (SEVEN) times in the theatre because never before has a movie made me this HAPPY!  I don't think I've seen any other movie that many times even after it appears for free on tv.  Anyone who can't just sit back & enjoy it for the pure entertainment factor it provides, is either a snob or a scrooge.  You will fall in love with Greece, ABBA music, Meryl Streep & most especially for me, Pierce Brosnan.  True, he doesn't have a trained voice, but the charm & sincerity with which he sings & portrays this character supercedes anything else.  I was never a fan before but I am now!  Can't wait until it comes out on dvd so I can watch it as often as I want on my new hd tv!  Now that I think of it, this will make a fabulous Christmas gift for everyone on my list!  Mamma Mia! for everyone!
0142000663|5.0|The second Steinbeck book that I've read as an adult, and probably one of the best books I've ever read.  I had no idea California was so messed up until I read it.  Unlike some modern readers who may complain about the alternating chapters, one dealing with plot and the other with seemingly irrelevant information, I thought that they added a lot to the book and gave it the feeling that there was more to it than just the story of one family.  Everyone needs to read this book.  The movie's also great, and I can't say that either one is better than the other.
B001KPK6Q2|2.0|The singing sounds highly processed, with telltale signs of the \\"auto-tune\\" effect, which, used in excess, makes the singer sound like a robot. To my ear, it sounds as if the producer ran every single song through auto-tune, and that ruins it for me.   I'd love to hear what Taylor Swift really sounds like, without the digital pitch correction.
B001DTPZNY|5.0|Just like old times. When he first shows up in the movie I thought he looked too old for the part. Once he put the hat on it was like seeing an old friend after a long time. Great action.
B00005R2IS|5.0|Mad Max is one of the best post-apocolyptic films of all time, exceeded only by a few films, including it's own sequel (The Road Warrior or Mad Max 2, depending on where you're from). Full of great stunts and plenty of action, this film influences to this day. This vesion includes a few extras which you will enjoy if you are a fan of the series.
B001DU8T6S|4.0|Well, I finally got a copy of the album. Bought the itunes version first cause it contains a couple of bonus tracks (including Runaway). Then I burnt a CD for my car and was really disappointed with the the loss of sound from mp4 compression.    Bought a CD from the store. Much better, though the sound is still a little flat for my taste, particularly the bass.     I listened a few times over the past few days. It is a brilliant album, but it takes a few listens to hear some of the nuances. I have read comments that this is more a Paul Rodgers (PR) album than a Queen album. I suppose you hear what you want to hear. I hear lots of Queen influences. For instance, I could easily imagine Freddie M singing \\"Time To Shine\\" among others.     However, Tracks like Still Burnin' (clever reference to \\"We Will Rock you\\" notwithstanding) are PR gems with pure PR genius. He makes it sound just effortless.    I don't like the Warboys version here, much prefer the live version on PR's DVD/CD's.     \\"Small\\" had a Beatle-esque feel to it. Fabulous lyric! And what a chorus!    \\"We Believe\\" is another track that I can easily \\"hear\\" Freddie M singing. Same with the campy \\"Call Me\\".    \\"Voodoo\\" is jut pure PR magic and my favorite track on the album (well so far anyway). Very tasteful guitar from Brian May, different from his usual power sound.    \\"Some Things That Glitter\\" and \\"C-lebrity\\" are great tracks and sound like real collaborations.    \\"Through The Night\\" evokes memories of Bad Co in it's structure. The chorus sounds a little weak IMHO, but great song anyway.     \\"Say It's Not True\\" released many months ago. Wish PR had sung the whole song or at least more of it.     \\"Surf's Up\\" - this is my least favorite track. Overproduced and noisy. Interesting (and good) piano work here. Disonance is not something I normally hear from PR recordings.    \\"Small - Reprise\\" - lovely - should have been longer!    \\"Runaway\\" - bonus track (Itunes) - Fabulous version, simple but great vocal. Too bad about the m4p compression. Q+PR - put in on the CD. CD buyers should get all the songs.    \\"The Show Must Go On - live\\" - bonus track (Itunes). When PR sings this, it just gives me chills. Same comment about compression and PUT IT ON THE CD!

B00006G8K0|5.0|&#34;Horror of Dracula&#34; may not be a faithful adaptation of Bram Stoker's classic Gothic vampire tale, in fact far from it, but it is a fine take of Stoker's novel.In this version, Jonathan Harker goes to Dracula's castle at the beginning under the guise of a librarian, but he actually knows what Dracula is and his purpose is to destroy him. Unfortunately, he is killed by Dracula and the vampire goes to London to prey upon Harker's fiancee, Lucy Holmwood [yes, they changed the names too], and later on Mina Holmwood, Lucy's sister-in-law. It is left to Van Helsing [Peter Cushing] and Arthur Holmwood [Lucy's brother and Mina's husband] to destroy the monster.<br /><br />Christopher Lee, in his first portrayal of the evil Count Dracula, may not have much screen time, but he makes the most of the limited time he does have. His Count is sensual and evil at the same time - exerting a hypnotic effect upon his female victims that have them eagerly disrobing for the count's pleasure [and fangs:)].<br /><br />Peter Cushing does an amazing job as Dr Van Helsing, vampire hunter and his commanding presence and determination to hunt down and destroy the monster that is Dracula is so credibly done that I was cheering him on all through the movie.<br /><br />The female victims are suitably beautiful and helpless in the face of Dracula's charm and manipulations, and though this movie doesn't exactly scream big budget, I thought the production values were pretty decent - the vivid colors, the sets and scenery all enhanced the movie experience.There is a genuine atmosphere of menace that is effectively conveyed via the creepy score and sets.<br /><br />This is the first horror movie I watched [back on TV when I was ten] and I remember being so absolutely terrified that I slept with a pillow covering my neck for a long time afterwards! Watching it now, the terror effect may be somewhat diminished but my appreciation of the movie and the acting is very much intact. A must-have for fans of Dracula and especially Lee and Cushing.shing.

0689859368|1.0|We got the beautiful collection trunk valued over $100. It's filled with a great variety of expensive paper treatments and gorgeous illustrations (although most of them are black/white). It's definitely impressive as a present until you start reading. So I'm assuming the largest portion of the price is comprised of the cost of the book production.<br />As much as my son (8 y/o) loves the subject-matter of this kind, every time we read, his attention begins to wonder every 2 minutes. The language used in the books is a way too dry and too complicated for kids, filled with pointless descriptions of insignificant things, while major scenes lack in-depth narration. So it seems you're reading a bunch of summaries that could have been linked to each other in a more engaging manner. BORING! We barely finished one chapter a day. Frankly, I was looking forward to the end of the story, so we could jump onto something more exciting than the Spiderwick Chronicles.<br />I'm surprised how many customers have left positive reviews for this  \\"Magic For Dummies.\\" The movie is so much better! Now that my son and I have finished reading, I see why the movie was modified so much - it was ADJUSTED into a consistent story that would be properly digested by the young audience.<br /><br />P.S. Bravo to the graphic designers, illustrator, and the book binding professionals! Great job designing such a visually appealing package for such a useless piece!

B001DHXT20|5.0|Before watching this movie, I had a great number of expectations.  Disappointed that actor Eric Bana wasn't returning; I thought Edward Norton was going to phone in his performance.  This one gets off the ground running.  We get to see our favorite jade jawed hero in action from the first frame.  Oscar winner, William Hurt, was the perfect General Ross.  Obsessed and out of control, he manages to create a bitter rival in Blonski or the Abomination.  Tim Roth's intensity made the movie work outside the realm of comics.  Although he was much unlike his four color counterpart; it worked!<br /><br />Liv Tyler was the perfect actress for Betty Ross.  It appeared the relationship between Banner and Ross had progressed over time.  What I did admire was the tribute to the TV show, with the opening sequence.  It didn't take a set of Cliff Notes to know how Banner transformed into the creature.  The audience was not left wanting.  I would like to know how the writer and director are going to top this one in Hulk 3?  Will they feature the Leader or the Rhino for the nemesis?
B00076RT24|4.0|I admit that The Phantom Menace isn't quite as good as other Star Wars films, but it's still pretty good. I was a little bit disappointed the first time I watched it, but I gave it another chance and realized how good it actually was once you look past the surface of certain characters and races. Everytime I watch it the movie seems to get better because I pick up little things that add to the overall Star Wars Universe. That being said, the main reason I give it only four stars is because after watching the deleted scenes I see what the movie could have been had some of those scenes been left in. If anyone has read the novelization they know how important certain scenes were that were left out of the theatrical release of Episode I. Perhaps George Lucas will release Special Editions of the first three films in the series (Episodes I-III) and include those additional scenes to expand the universe a bit more. If that happens I will definitely be giving the extended version of this film five stars. So this only gets four stars, but seeing and/or buying this DVD is a must if you are a science-fiction fan, and especially if you are even a casual Star Wars fan. For those who dismissed this film before, I say give it another chance. I did and I was glad I gave it another watch.
1591841992|3.0|Debo reconocer que lo revisé en 3 horas (rápido) pues no quiero atarme a una metodología precisa de cómo transmitir mis ideas con esquemas y dibujos. Prefiero crear la mía para mis necesidades. Sin embargo le diría al autor que no intente dar tantos ánimos a quienes dudan de su capacidad de dibujar. ¡Ellos no comprarán su libro en primer lugar! Le apostaría que quienes compran su libro lo hacen por que sienten que sí pueden. No pierda el tiempo y para una siguiente edición (¡¡por favor siga en esta nueva línea de comunicación!!)incluya más ejemplos que son iluminadores y más motivadores que las palabras.  A mi me será útil en mis clases con universitarios (aunque se ríen de los intentos de dibujo de su profesor, lo que no es malo del todo)y para presentar proyectos a personas más creativas, más sentimentales y menos conservadores que los habituales gerentes de empresa.  Vale la pena. Es novedoso y agradable de revisar, pero puede ser muy mejorado.  Gracias DAN ROAM por atreverse.
B0018CMJSU|2.0|Godfather 3 erases all the good that 1&2 give. I have good equipment, but the audio is impossible to understand. It sounds like you are in the subway all the time, even when they clearly are no where near it. It seems like they lay down a track of loud hissing over the whole production. This is the restored version? It's a slap in the face for loyal fans.

It has everything you love about Stargate Atlantis..Makay/Sheppard moments, Team, Action, Epic Music, Funny moments...everything you love about this show.   Highly recommended and enjoyable episode, you will not be disappointed. This episode is why I thoroughly enjoy watching SGA live each Friday night!   After viewing this episode, I just wonder how tptb could decide to move this very entertaining show from weekly TV to a movie....just boggles the mind!
B0015FML06|5.0|If you have seen the tape Version of this then you know what you can expect. Only that this is clearly the better Sound and picture quality. Sure you can see that this is an old recording but the Sound Quality is amazing. This set is for every U2 fan out there a must have.
B0013ND30M|4.0|I must admit, priot to buying this item for my wife and upcoming daughter, I had never seen this movie before.<br /><br />The quality of the movie is insanely amazing.  The visuals and color pallet have been fully restored to a quality that matches animated features currently in production.  Same goes for the sound restoration.<br /><br />But ... the content of the movie was a bit darker than I anticipated.  I think, I may have to wait for my daughter to reach a certain age before she gets to watch this movie.  Having the main villain \\"summon the powers of hell\\" just seemed a little too heavy for a younger audience.<br /><br />But it was a good movie though overall.
B001EOQWEO|5.0|Wall-E, like Cars didn't convince me when I saw the previews.  It was a robot movie.  Robots and CGI go hand in hand and the initial idea seemed to lack the inspiration Pixar had become known for.  But like Cars, the Pixar crew can take what seems to be a dull topic and lace it with excellent storytelling, brilliant chracterization, and this one gets the added bonus of providing social commentary.  That they can do all this and still make it appeal to kids is a feat - one that Pixar has been successful at since their first foray into feature films.    First of all, this is one of Pixar's most visually satisfying features.  It has to be.  The first 30 minutes or so of the film feature one sole character - Wall-E - and his limited dialogue, which is pretty much uttering his name.  He picks up trash from an abandoned Earth.  The ugly setting in and of itself provides exposition.  The earth has been trashed.  Signs on earth show how a corporate giant had a part in the pollution.  Through Wall-E's actions, we discover he is very creative with the trash, collecting little trinkets, even if he's not sure how it's used.  There's a certain bit of emotion he finds in an old recording of \\"Hello Dolly.\\"  In a rarity for Pixar, they marry some little bits of live action.  The movie shifts as Eve, another robot, comes to earth in search of vegetation to see if it's at all inhabitable.    That a movie with so little dialogue has such emotional depths and is so thought provoking says something about the talent at Pixar.  Much has to be credited with the wonderful visual presentation of the film, clearly painting landscapes of earth and of the spaceship where those who evacated earth inhabit, slaves to a lazy consumer culture.  Amazingly, with all the social commentary, the film doesn't talk over kids' heads.  Far beyond being just great artists, the folks at Pixar are also great storytellers. This film harks back to the themes of Finding Nemo and it definitely posesses that film'sheart.    This is probably the first Pixar film that has social overtones.  Indeed the film is indictment on what people are doing to the environment and while some of the imagery is broad and funny (people in the future have become lazy and fat, and there are a lot of sight gags portraying it), it's actually a pretty sad future that is painted here. It's delivered tactfully and while adults will pick on the subtle themes and stabs at pop culture, kids should be able to watch this film and pick up and be encouraged to discuss these films.  In a feat for Disney, this one actually teaches social responsibility.  But aside from that, it's one of Pixars best achievements to date.
B00005JPTK|4.0|In \\"I Am Legend\\" the apocalypse has hit the world, a man-made virus intended for good, intended to cure cancer, but gone horribly awry.  On a planet now populated by hordes of mutated, vampire-like victims of the plague, a surviving military scientist (Will Smith, in his best performance), somehow immune to the disease, works in a fortified house to find a cure, walking the city with his canine companion in search of specimens to test various experimental treatments on, and in search for survivors.      He's set up a radio transmitter that sends out messages on all frequencies urging any other survivors to meet him at a certain time and place to band together, but day after day, year after year, he finds no one there to meet him.  Interspersed with the post-apocalyptic time frame we see frequent flashbacks showing the early days when the 'cure' was going wrong, and global panic was breaking out.  The plague victims are nightmarish creatures, shirking from the sun, ravenous, violent and mindless.  During the nights the doctor barricades himself and his companion inside the house, but the ghastly creatures are out there, always.  It's a bleak world being presented, but done well.  I've noted before that 'bleak' is among the hardest moods to do right in a movie, but I Am Legend does it brilliantly.  Part of it is that the grim mood is punctuated by touches of the idyllic: the abandoned city beginning to look alive again as all this beautiful greenery creeps in, deer bounding about...but there's nothing idyllic or peaceful once you get into the shadows where the creatures dwell.  One of the creatures, in particular, is especially disturbing: he seems much smarter than the others, seems angrier than the others, and the others are starting to follow his lead.        **WARNING: POSSIBLE SEMI-SPOILERS AHEAD***        Eventually, Smith's character does come across another survivor, two actually: a woman and her little boy.  Instead of just relief, tension soon follows.  Smith has by this point become utterly defeated psychologically and spiritually - he no longer believes there's any hope of his finding a way of reversing the mutation, he's lost faith in just about everything, and he reacts with disbelief and almost anger as she claims God guided her to him, and her claims that an entire colony of survivors is out there waiting for them.        Where the movie goes from here I'll refrain from hinting at, but it continues developing.  A lot of what happens in the latter parts are highly interpretative, and fascinating.  The movie does miss a couple of opportunities, and is a bit slow in places, but those minor hindrances are blown away by the overall power of the movie.  Emotional, at times frightening, at times spiritual, boasting great cinematography and great performances from a cast that has some very demanding material, I Am Legend is among the top movies of 2007.  9/10
0743270754|5.0|I'm not a history buff, but I fell in love with this book.

I learned a great deal about Lincoln's presidency, Civil War and the various leaders from that era.  It's a great read!
B001GZ6QDS|5.0|Batman and company have been appearing in live-action adaptations through movies or tv for decades now, but 2005's [[ASIN:B000BUYP4Q Batman Begins (Two-Disc Special Edition)]] was the first (and long-awaited) appearance in live-action of a Batman and a Gotham City that resemble the comic book versions of the modern age.  \\"The Dark Knight\\" carries on this tradition, picking up about a year after \\"Batman Begins\\" with the Bat's war on crime in full swing and Carmine Falcone's once all-encompassing crime empire battered but plowing on.  Two major new forces enter in the form of new District Attorney Harvey Dent (Aaron Eckhart), who's on his own full-speed-ahead crusade to clean up the city, and a madman clown calling himself The Joker (Heath Ledger, of course) who takes on good guys and bad guys alike in malicious glee.  Despite Joker's initial attacks on interests of the crime family, they end up taking him up on his offer for help against Batman because they feel the Bat poses the greater threat to their continued existance.  Joker's tactics wind up pushing Batman, Dent, and the GCPD closer to the edge.  Batman, Dent, and Jim Gordon - the three key figures in the battle to bring the city back from the brink it's been on for years - all wind up having to navigate situations where the line between right and wrong, and how to respond to different threats, isn't all that clear.       Heath Ledger has justifiably gotten tons of praise for his portrayal of the psychotic Joker, and rightfully so - I feel it's equal to his performance in [[ASIN:B00005JOFQ Brokeback Mountain (Widescreen Edition)]] - but the other performers have consequently gotten a little lost in the hype, and not gotten the credit they're do.  \\"The Dark Knight\\" features an outstanding ensemble cast, with Christian Bale making a great Batman, and Gary Oldman (Jim Gordon), Morgan Freeman (Lucius Fox), Michael Caine (Alfred Pennyworth), Maggie Gyllenhaal (replacing Katie Holmes as Rachel Dawes) and Eckhart(Dent) all bringing their characters to life.  This movie gives all the so-called 'supporting' characters, as well as the overall situation in Gotham, and the role of the city itself, important parts in building up the whole.  For a long time, I've felt that pretty much all modern comic book series are in reality ensemble books, with the character in the title (Batman, Superman, Hulk, whoever) being more the flagship character of the cast, instead of totally dominating things.  And \\"The Dark Knight\\" has done things that way too, has let different players and different facets of the story get good sceen time instead of just being the backdrop for Batman Vs. Joker.      Visually, the film is incredible, and captures the comics's look incredibly - a couple of images look just like the photorealistic paintings of Alex Ross in a book like [[ASIN:1401211038 Justice, Vol. 1]].  The action is fantastic and tense.  The look of the city, the design of the Batmobile, everything on this level has been expertly crafted.      As for flaws?  There are very, very few.  Some might argue that the Joker is in some ways different from in the comics - i.e. he wears white face paint instead of actually being a death white, things like that.  I think the thing that mattered was that they really got the character's mindset right was what mattered - he's not, despite his name, supposed to be a 'comedic relief' character, and he's not simply a criminal mastermind with an outlandish costume.  He's a hyperviolent psychopath who's arguably the most totally devoid-of-conscience enemy Batman's ever faced, and this comes across on screen.  The exact specifics of his appearance, etc. have varied over the years, but what's important, whether it's in the comics, the movies or elsewhere, is to get the character's core right.  The way Batman's handled is also excellent, and he's certainly built up more convincingly than in most of the pre-2005 movies, although I did find one glitch - the scene in whichhe thwarts one of the Falcone family's henchmen by seizing the gun barrel and bending it back.  It's very important to remember that Batman does Not have superhuman strenth, nor does his armored costume give him any special 'powers'.  This kind of thing only happened the once so it's no big drawback, but it is something the filmmakers might want to be conscious of so it doesn't get out of hand next time around.      It certainly doesn't take away from the movie being one of the year's best though.  And without giving anything away, the ending only makes one more eager for the next chapter.  A+

B000002AH7|4.0|Miles Davis' 1960 album Sketches Of Spain shows a wide variety of Jazz with a few Spanish sounding instruments, which highly explains the reason for the album's title. The horns on the album are so deep and the Spanish bells throughout the background helps elevate the sound. The tracks that I enjoyed the most are \\"Concierto de Aranjuez (Adagio)\\" and \\"Solea\\", both songs clocking in over 10 minutes. It's great because both songs are built up to their climax deep in the track. It's a great jazz album for those who are interested in the genre, but it falls short of what most consider his best album [[ASIN:B000002ADT Kind of Blue]] (which many, as well as myself hold high regards to). Still a wonderful album, conducted by Gill Evans (you can hear him talking in the background at the end of a few songs), that is a definite for any musical collection. Peace.
B000002JPA|2.0|Purchased this CD about a year ago due to all the great reviews posted on Amazon. I have three Dream Theater CD's, Metropolis Part II, Train of Thought and Change of Seasons. Train of Thought is really good and Metropolis Part II is one of my favorite CD's.       Listened for a few times when I received, and I wasn't very impressed. Pull Me Under, Under a Glass Moon and Another Day have their moments, but overall just wasn't much to grab my attention.       Recently decided to give it another listen to see if I just put it to  the side too quickly. Sometimes it just take more listens for an album to grow on you. After five or six more listens, sad to say I still don't care for this very much.       Oh the guys can really play their instruments, but most of the songs just really fall flat. The operatic screaming of James La Brie makes me cringe ever time I hear it. I find myself dreading some of the chorus just for this reason. Just sounds too 'hair bandesh' in too may parts.        I will keep on enjoying my other DT releases, but this one is not really that good.

There is nothing homosenual about this book, only in the eye of the reader.

It grabs your attention from the very first notes played by world-renown keyboardist Bradley Joseph and drummer Charlie Adams in the song \\"Santorini\\". Every song is highly orchestrated, some upbeat, others soft and mellow, but each one just as jaw-dropping as the last. Shardad Rohani does an amazing job conducting the Royal Philharmonic Concert Orchestra, as well as dueling violins with Karen Briggs in the song \\"Within Attraction\\". All of Yanni's live concerts are wonderful utilizing some of the greatest musicians in the world, but I have to say that this concert is his best and will live on in infamy. Its no wonder why it is the second best-selling concert film of all time. I seriously don't think he can ever top it.

B001GQSY5U|2.0|The visuals were bad and the dialogue was straight out of a Saturday morning cartoon.  Having said all that, the acting was better than the combined efforts of episodes 1-3.    The visuals:  The ships and background images looked alive while the characters themselves looked and moved like they were carved out of wood.  Very cheap.    The dialogue:  Anakin calls his new sidekick \\"Snips\\", and she calls him \\"Skyguy\\"...or something like that.  All of the robots act like out of work comedians dropping dumb jokes all over the place.  I know this movie was really just a setup for the Cartoon Network series, but really!    I really wanted to like this movie, but it fell just short of being mediocre.  As much as I hate to say it, I keep holding out hope, so I'll keep watching them as long as they keep making them.    As a longtime fan of Star Wars, I would like to pose this question to other longtime Star Wars fans:  Is it possible for us to file a class action lawsuit against George Lucas to take the franchise away from him?  I figure there's not much more time before he completely destroys it.  Perhaps we can take Indiana Jones away from him as well.    He can keep Howard the Duck.

0810979772|5.0|This is the series that got my 8 year old son to want to read on his own - that is worth 10 stars to me!  When we purchased this book, I thought he would just skip over the pages where you are asked to write and be done within one evening.  No so, my son did not take his nose out of the book for over two straight hours after purchasing it.  He was dilegntly writing and drawing as well as reading.  I can't wait to sneak a peak and see what he wrote.  To me it is a wonderful keepsake book that I'll keep when he has children of his own and can read all the wonderful adventures and ideas he had at 8 years old.  The author prompts something most books don't, being creative and using your own imagination.  HIGHLY recommend this one!!!

B001ED7C58|4.0|The soundtrack to any work of film is something that all film buffs should have.  In this case though, I think many in the Twilight world have previously created their own interpretations of the film by way of music and created their own soundtracks.  In this sense, listeners may be somewhat disappointed and there are some track, like Perry Farrell's, that don't seem to fit the general tone of the novel or the film, but were added, presumably, because they were written specifically for the film.  Bands like Paramore, Linkin Park, Carter Burwell, and Robert Pattinson himself, contributed some wonderful pieces of original music in which to indulge one's self in the captivating world of Meyer's vampires.      Though this collection of music did nto adhere to my personal soundtrack, I am happy to have it in my collection of works and creations stemming from the original Meyers novel.
B001GQ2TGA|5.0|I absolutely love this CD!  My favorite track is And Winter Came.  Next would be Trains and Winter Rains.  The others are phenomenal as well.  An earlier post stated this CD has a feel of cynical commercialism.  If you go to her web site and listen to her explanation of this CD she states she wanted to do a more modern take on Christmas carols. Now days unfortunately commercialism at Christmas time is just about every where you turn. The only grievance I have with this CD is I miss when in her earlier work she would blend her native Celtic tongue with English and this CD is predominately English.  Other than that I would definitely call this CD a winner!

0790731940|5.0|Just look at this cover and tell me that Jodi Foster is not hot.  If you said she is not hot, you are a liar and blind!!!    Buy this movie and have a Jodi Foster night with it.
B0013XS8A2|5.0|Heard this CD while traveling on tour in the UK.  I was very taken with it, and bought it when I got home.  I can't believe how well it went with the English countryside as we traveled.  Now it causes me to harken back to that trip!  The music, in my opinion, is very beautiful with lots of different instrumentation and voices.  There has to something everyone would love on the album.
B00004T9UF|5.0|This was definatly Em's gratest moment artistically, and even 9 years later it still hits hard, proving that it wasnt just \\"Shock value\\" that made it a hit. Best songs: \\"The Way I Am\\", \\"Kim\\" and \\"Criminal\\"
1596434252|3.0|[[ASIN:1596434252 ABC3D]]    I purchased this popup book for my granddaughter.  Some of the popup letters didn't work properly.  Quality control?  The book its self is rather unique in someways and was motivational.

B0010X8NF0|5.0|Had no problems playing the DVD and it was delivered in an acceptable time frame.
B0013FYTA8|4.0|They clearly sound like Nickleback and this is the first time I ever heard them.They sound related throw in a little puddle of mud and seether.I think of them the same as Nickleback they can make some good stuff but the girly songs like Not Meant To Be if they both didnt make crap like this I'd like them both much more.I understand they both make music for females but that doesn't make it good.I know both bands can make more  meaner stuff instead of these cheesy love songs that make me want to sleep.    By the Way/Crutch has girly lyrics but the songs doesn't sound as girly.It's still not mean enough sounding for me.Bad girlfriend is more the attitude I'm looking for but the song itself is ok.    I'm not fully bashing them I'm giving them 4 stars for their good songs on here.Got it made is cool.If you like Nickleback or Puddle of Mud I would buy this.
B00000K3CM|5.0|This is one of my favorite holiday movies, because it's funny and entertaining and it's not centered around Santa Clause!
B001ECQ6YW|3.0|The underline message makes for a good family movie. But the graphics and art are unimpressive. The main character has great quality art/CGI, like facial expressions. Supporting characters have limited quality art, the rest are poor. With few exceptions, the music and scenes are forgettable. Last, the story seems to run out of steam midway into the movie.
0375826726|4.0|But it is not.  There will be a book 4.  That's ok though, the books are entertaining so I will gladly read another one.  Very entertaining!
0142402532|5.0|I have read this book countless time, and when my copy went missing i just had to buy it again. Dahl his a brilliant writer who whose work cam be adored by people from ages 8 to eighty eight.
1400049628|5.0|Yes, I know the subject area is zombies, and that that's crazy and \\"fictional,\\" but this guide gives good advice for any scenario.  This guide could be applied to any even marginally apocolyptic case, and the information would be just as valid.  Also, if you're not worried about a zombie apocolypse, this book is just a darn good read.
B001EN71DG|1.0|They should have released this on Blu-ray. To have fans wait and wait and wait to get old movies released on high quality media is a bit disgusting really. After all this time they are delaying the release to make folks buy multiple copies of old movies. It just smacks of greed. Very disappointing..
B0016Q2D5M|1.0|I give it 1 star only because I couldn't rate it 0 stars.  The minute I popped it into the DVD player and it started playing, I realized that I had just wasted my money.  Only watched 30 minutes and even that was hard to do.  Started to give me a headache.  Images DO NOT MATCH UP for good 3D.  Save your money for something else.
B000PMG16U|2.0|I don't know anyone who'd say: \\"I don't like the original three Star Wars films.  I only want the prequels.\\"  I would think most everyone would want \\"IV, V, and VI\\", and it makes sense that they are available as their own individual release, because there are alot of people who didn't care for the later \\"I, II, and III\\" prequels.  I bought the complete set because I'm rather a completist.  Besides, I kinda think that Episode III: \\"The Revenge of the Sith\\" is an important introduction to the rise of Darth Vader.<br /><br />What's more, even though Episodes: I, II, and III were the newest films, I think the earlier three (Episodes: IV, V, and VI) look better on film because they don't have all that pasty look of computer graphics.  Compare Jabba The Hut on \\"The Phantom Menace\\" and look at him (it) again on \\"The Return of the Jedi.\\"  In \\"The Return of the Jedi\\", Jabba the Hut looks more realistic.  And especially look at Yoda (done in CGI) in \\"Attack of the Clones\\" and compare him to the skilled puppeteers and make-up of Yoda in \\"The Empire Strikes Back.\\"  Yoda looks better as an actor with make-up than he does as pasty looking CGI.<br /><br />So anyway, again I ask: \\"Who would bother to buy just the prequel?\\"  Would they rather buy the two separate 3 disc sets and pay more than what you would get with the 9 disc Complete Saga?
0596522347|5.0|The book is so packed with practical and pragmatic tips, it's usefull as soon as you open it. Great format to keep browsing through to find inspiration and check how you are doing on your slide deck while you work on it. Thanks for sharing the results of so many years of experience and expertise, Nancy!
B000002LAC|5.0|I love this CD! It's definately one of my all time favorites - a classic.
0307346617|5.0|This amazing read details the beginning, climax, and mop-up of the zombie apocalypse using a series of interviews with everyone from heads of military departments to farmers and industrymen. This book shows the human species' tenacity and undying willpower, but it also shows how thick-headed and corrupt people can really be.    Although the subject matter may not directly relate to many people, the underlying social narrative relates to everyone and everything in our society today.
1416575464|4.0|A lot of reviewers are saying this book skews very young/modern.  I wouldn't quite say that about the rooms in the book, but it's \\"young\\" in the sense that the aesthetic is much less rigid than more traditional looks.    If you're unfamiliar with the magazine, I'd describe the overall look as polished eclectic.  It's not super-casual, and definitely not matched.  For example, there is a fondness for incorporating very traditional, formal pieces or elements (such as molding or antique chairs), but instead of following that particular style with the rest of the furniture and decor, the designers will incorporate a variety of different pieces.      In other words, this is not a look for people who like to buy furniture in sets.  Nor for people who like to adhere faithfully to a particular style.  Unlike another reviewer suggested, I think this is not necessarily about budget as it is just a different perspective.  Of course, eclecticism is helpful or inevitable when you are on a limited budget, but this is by no means a book on thrift, and, unless you really are loyal to following a style, you won't think these rooms are jumbled together.    What I appreciate about this book is that it does try to teach how to accomplish mixing these very different items successfully and avoid the jumbled mess.  They break particular rooms into elements (furniture, upholstery, hardware), and show how they come together.  I also really liked the pages that showed how a designer took her particular inspiration and created a room piece by piece.    My favorite chapter is probably bedrooms.  I think the Domino look is most striking here because, conventionally, bedrooms can go over the top with matching everything (bed in a bag, after all) and throwing pillows on every available surface.  Domino features a lot of contemporary, fresh bedrooms that are beautiful and sumptuous without being fussy or overly feminine.
B000B7BRMM|3.0|This is grown up Christmas music.  I think it's okay.  My husband thinks its great.  I don't think I could listen to it over and over again in a day.  But on occassion during the holidays it makes for nice romantic tree gazing music.<br /><br />She has a nice sultry jazzy style.
B001EN71DG|5.0|Lucas will probably release these on to Blu-Ray DVD's when something better than Blu-Ray comes out.  And then you can buy the new format again and again and again and again and again and so on and so on.<br /><br />Do you think video quality improvement is going to end with Blu-Ray?  I'll bet they are working on something better than Blu-Ray as we speak so that maybe 5 years from now when everyone's replaced their favorite DVD's with Blu-Ray discs, they'll expect us to start replacing our favorite Blu-Ray movies with, yet again, another improved format.<br /><br />See where I'm going with this?  You are probably going to buy Star Wars over and over again til the day you die!  I'll stick with the DVD's that I have.  They all look fine, and there is no reason to buy them again.  That goes for \\"Star Wars\\" as well as my other 600 or so movies that I can barely find time to watch as it is.<br /><br />Getting the best picture of your favorite movies over and over again, year after year, is compulsively expensive and is hardly, realistically, not very necessary.<br /><br />Get a life people!  Get off the couch!
0321525655|5.0|A great compilation of basic and simple ideas about public presentation, yet fundamental ones. You may have read about these concepts already (e.g. Made to Stick, slide:ology), but Garr connects them nicely and the zen concept is not only refreshing, it helps alleviating the stress often assotiated with public speaking.
B0017I1FNK|5.0|I love it.  It's more relaxing than others, so if you want rock and roll this is not for you.
0060920432|5.0|One of my very favorite books.    Written for a popular audience, the author describes the fascinating results of his academic career of researching exactly what makes people happy.        His findings are surprising.  Most people don't know what makes them happy.  For example, most people don't realize that they are happiest at work or why; they believe they would be happier with more leisure time.  I found most facsinating the studies of people who had lost limbs.  The book explains why, although parapalegics would rather still have their limbs, for many, the loss of their limbs actually made them happier.    The ideas presented explain why so many people are unhappy when enjoying historically unprecedented levels of physical comfort.  The book is also uplifting in that it points out that we truly can be happy in any situation.    Although the book does ramble at times, this is one of the best books I have ever read.  I am more than willing to put up with less than perfect writing to gain the remarkable insights that are clearly laid out in the book.  Not surprisingly, the book does not provide a recipe to make you happy.  But it does provide general concepts that can be applied to your particular situation and preferences.
B000CNESU8|4.0|The movie is a prophetic masterpiece. Look around you. Here we are at the height of the information age. Inundated with pseudo reality shows. Biased media spin doctors creating political super-stars and even getting a unqualified junior senator elected President of the US. Might as well been written by Chayesky himself.   As mentioned in an earlier review the digital transfer leads much to be desired. But the films message is so important, even now 30 years later, that you should buy it anyway.
B001B71NOI|5.0|Excellent Work!    This is a very mature work from Trent Reznor getting back to his essential power looking back to the pretty hate machine but now with the progress of technology its better and more sophisticated you can tell, that Mr. Reznor hasn't lost his touch and the way of making new music that will influence another bands and will sound so good live, I can tell by my self that this album sounds great live and I truly recommend it at all.    Thank you Mr. Reznor and NINE INCH NAILS!
B00138H7YK|5.0|I've listened to this album since it was released back in the 70's.  I continue to listen to it regularly.  It never leaves my cd player.  Brings back great memories... with a little bit of rock and  little bit of sort of easy listening.

1416594884|1.0|Only the John Le Carre name carries this totally forgettable intrigue. I'm three quarters of the way through and it has been a struggle to continue. None of the characters interest me except wiht the possible exception of the 'victim' of the story but as his character is never really developed we don't get to know him.     I'm not American so I am not clouded by patriotism. The book is simply not up to the Le Carre name.

B001EXE2ZG|5.0|There are moments in SUNSET BOULEVARD when you literally don't know what you're watching.  High drama?  Acid black comedy?  Bitter surreal cynicism?  All of the above?<br /><br />I have always been blown away by this movie.  The talent and insight it possesses couldn't be done today, making it even more remarkable that it was made in 1950.  (One of the stories I've heard about it was that Director Billy Wilder, hoping to spring this new monster on an unsuspecting Hollywood, lied during production that he was making a delightful musical comedy called HILL OF BEANS.  After the premiere, he was verbally attacked by Hollywood bigwigs in the lobby, to which he replied, \\"F you!\\").<br /><br />Like so many other great classics, SUNSET BOULEVARD just fell into place.  Wilder originally wanted Mae West for Norma Desmond and Montgomery Clift for Joe Gillis (imagine what kind of film that would've been!).  The original opening showed Joe Gillis in the morgue with other talking corpses as he sits up to tell his story.<br /><br />But what you see is what you get.  It's still an amazing movie, stunning in its creativity and artistry.  That great shot in the opening of Joe Gillis floating face down in the Norma's pool as photographers snap photos was done with a chilled pool and a big mirror on the bottom.  The final shot and Norma's lines can still be quoted by the generations of film fans (and Carol Burnett fans!).<br /><br />The character of Joe Gillis would imprint William Holden for the rest of his career, lifting him from just another handsome leading man to an actor who could play characters who had seen too much and lost too much (STALAG 17, THE WILD BUNCH, NETWORK, etc.).<br /><br />Has-beens play has-beens, Cecil B. DeMille plays Cecil B. DeMille, and Jack Webb (Sgt. Joe Friday from TV's \\"Dragnet\\") is nearly unrecognizable as Gillis' pal, Artie Green.<br /><br />Not to be missed.  Ever.
B001F290E4|2.0|I find nothing wrong with covers, when done correctly than can find a nuance in material that the original singer may have missed, maybe that accounts for Dolly Parton's continuing need to fiddle with her own version of \\"I Will Always Love You.\\" But here, Seal has went to some of the top tier artists/songs and decided to just drink from the well instead of taking a bath in it.    I don't know who to blame, I would love to put it all on David Foster who decided to take every bit of grit from the arrangements and from Seal and leave us with what almost borders on lounge singer chic. \\"A Change is Gonna Come\\" has been left empty, from a simplistic reading and lack of push in phrasing. \\"It's a Man's Man's Man's World\\" just comes off in the same vein. The true crime here is Redding's \\"I've Been Lovin' You Too Long,\\" which has been drained of its heartbreaking simplicity.    Seal has a wonderful voice, his last album was a great return to form. But here he just seems to lack that extra sense of something that is needed to drive the material at hand. On the Today Show he mentioned that he had more than forty-five songs to choose from, I wonder what he left on the cutting room floor. Choosing such familiar and iconic songs leaves little room for mere interpretation, he would have had to open them up offer up something new, not just mimicry.

He's the concept artist for big movie hits like Star Wars, War of the Worlds and Terminator just to name a few.<br /><br />In this book are 30 lessons and step-by-step tutorials for creating science fiction art, mainly robots. There are details and tips for using Photoshop.<br /><br />Through these pages, one can see Doug Chiang's process of creating sci-fi concept art. It's always interesting to find out how other artist work, especially one of such high caliber.<br /><br />His work has also appeared in other books like Robota, and The Art of Star Wars: The Revenge of the Sith.<br /><br />(More pictures are available on my blog.

B000F1IQN2|4.0|\\"Israeli terrorist are called `commandos', Arab commandos are called `terrorist'.\\"<br />--George Carlin<br /><br />\\"And it shall come to pass in that day, that I will seek to destroy all the nations that come against Jerusalem.<br />And I will pour upon the house of David, and upon the inhabitants of Jerusalem, the spirit of grace and of supplications: and they shall look upon me whom they have pierced, and they shall mourn for him, as one mourneth for his only son, and shall be in bitterness for him, as one that is in bitterness for his firstborn.\\"<br />--Zechariah 12: 9-10<br /><br />What dose God do with his warriors that defend Israeli? Dose he reward them with great riches and peaces and happiness? Why no! At lest not in Stephen Spielberg's take on Operation Wrath of God, the Israeli respond for the 1972 massacre by the Black September Movement that caused the violent death of eleven Israeli wrestlers.<br /><br />Mossad agent Avner Kaufman is tasked as God's avenging hand, he and four other men systematically take out a series of men believed to have planned the Munich massacre. Like the a stealthy predator these man invoke God's promise to punish those to raise their hand against his chosen land. However has the team moves up the food chain they see that their actions have not in anyway made Israeli safer, it seems that with each of the Munich planner's they kill, another strike is made at Israeli, letter bombs, a man machine gun spraying people at an airport, and even Avner team becomes the target of retaliation.<br /><br />Instead of being reward for his defense of Israeli Avner becomes paranoid, ripping apart his room, looking for traps and sleeping in the closet. He becomes disillusion with his mission and disillusion with Israeli, he sees a never ending cycle of violence that he doesn't want to be a part of.<br /><br />Spielberg graphically illustrates that futility of clandestine counter-terrorism operations, for every man that they killed another comes in their place. The weight on Avner shoulders becomes so great that he even begins to question the legitimacy of the evidence that they are killing the right men. As he walks away from his Mossad handler for the last time in Brooklyn, the Twin Towers can be seen in the background.<br /><br />Ones views on this movie depends on how one views the Israeli-Palestinian conflict. So say the Spielberg is glorifying the \\"Israeli killer\\" and demonizing the \\"Palestinian heroes\\". Other say the exact opposite that Munich is trying to humanize the Palestinians and demonize the Israelis. I think it dose neither; this is a film that says `violence only begets more violence.'in their place.

B000FVE3AC|2.0|When this watch arrived I was very excited. It is big, heavy and seemed very well constructed. I was not put off by the Myota movement, but within the first week I lost several minutes. Next, the face was scratched and apparently it is not mineral so it is not scratch resistant. I would have expected more for the price I paid. I still wear it but I feel it is basically ruined because of the scratch. Would not recommend.
B001FB0WBK|5.0|Tommy is a master guitarist and entertainer. It's always best to see him in person but this DVD is a very good representation of what he does.     The music is wonderful and flawless. But the real joy is simply watching a person do what he was created to do with every bit of energy and exuberance he possesses. Tommy is a force of nature!
B0013ND30W|5.0|Sleeping Beauty in Blu-Ray is well worth the purchase price. I highly recommend it, even if you have a earlier DVD version. The visuals are very sharp and clear. The sound is very good, but because I have a older sound system, I do not want to make any comprehensive comments on that subject.
B001ED7C58|4.0|The Soundtrack has a great variety of songs and I can't wait to see how they'll use the songs in the film.
B001JOIEZ4|2.0|It'd be good to have songs to listen to while you read the Twilight books, or think about scenes that could go with the songs... it doesn't happen with this soundtrack. I was aware that the author of the books was into Muse, Paramore, and other of the bands in this soundtrack... but those songs were not really the best to put in here. Those bands have other songs that could have easily fit into the story line.  I think the movie could've used softer songs, not all these crazy guitars and emo singing... and of course... Bella's Lullaby... IT SOUNDS SCARY instead of beautiful. It's supposed to be a piano piece of course, and well... there's nothing lullaby-ish about it, it sounds more like... a scene is about to tense up with that song, instead of a love song... this is the song that Bella loves and Edward would hum for her to go to sleep... I'm so disappointed by it, the songs fans made up to be the lullaby were way better.    For those looking for a Twilight experience with music, I suggest for you to go to Stephenie Meyer's website and go through the playlists she has for each book, most of the songs go with the scenes and dialogues. Not this soundtrack crap.
B001AJVR5M|5.0|As a 42 year old mother of a big JB fan, I must say I was really impressed.  Not only are the guys great songwriters, but the whole album, especially Lovebug, has great guitar licks.  However, my favorite must be Nick's title song, A Little Bit Longer.  I cried as I listened to the lyrics because my daughter, the big JB fan, is a Type 1 Diabetic.  I remembered how I felt when I heard the news ...  A great production from very talented young men.  I believe they will eventually leave their pop image behind and become known as a great rock band!
1932907009|5.0|As a young college student with a passion for film I have thought many times, \\"Hey!  I can write one of those things!\\"  Well, Blake Snyder is here to help!  From Fade-In to Fade-Out, Save The Cat! is engaging, insightful, and impossible to put down.  Furthermore it's EASY TO UNDERSTAND!  Having no previous knowledge about screenwriting I was able to pick up STC! and, by the book's end, feel empowered and capable of writing a fantastic AND sellable script!  Snyder's book demystifies the craft of screenwriting for us newcomers.  How did they come up with that idea?  How can I make my hero likeable even if he's a \\"bad guy?\\"  What is a logline and why is it so important?  From its 15 point Beat Sheet to the 7 Immutable Laws of Screenplay Physics, Save The Cat! explains all this and tons more in a way that's fresh and brilliant from beginning to end.  Blake Snyder's Save The Cat! may very well be the last book on screenwriting you'll ever need!
B001GQ2TGA|5.0|I was so beyond excited when I heard that Enya had a new cd coming out, and to top it off, a Christmas cd. I bought it today on my lunch hour and enjoyed listening to it at work. She brings peace into all of our crazy, hectic lives with her calming, therapeutic melodies. She has always been my absolute favorite artist. Every song on this cd is wonderful. I have heard the first and last tracks on this cd before; they're on two separate import singles which I own many of. They sounded slightly different; more vocals, and just as gorgeous, if not better. I highly recommend this cd to all of the huge Enya fans out there... perfect for the holidays, or whenever! : )
1400095204|5.0|Nigeria's was created as a country by European powers after World War I, \\"uniting\\" three disparate groups of people:  the Muslim Hausa in the North; Yoruba in the Southwest; and Igbo (or Ibo) in the Southeast.  Nigeria gained its independence from the British Empire in 1960.  Author Chimamandra Ngozi Adichie portrays the conflict that led to the Igbo declaring their independence as Biafra in 1967, and the ensuing war with Nigeria, through the stories of two Igbo sisters, Olanna and Kainene Ozobia, and their families and household members.  The author provides richly detailed descrptions of the land and lives of numerous strata of Nigerian and Biafran society, and the devastation wreaked by the war that resulted in the starvaion of so many Biafrans.  Adichi manages to enlighten the reader on everything from what the people ate to international policies that fed the disaster . . . an excellent work.

I was really shocked on track 11 when I heard an electric guitar, this is a first, so some real different musical flavors in this album.<br /><br />This is not an Enya album that you put on to fall asleep to as there are quite a few more upbeat songs on this album.
0307237699|4.0|I began reading this book at a friend's house and found it so interesting that I immediately purchased it as an audiobook. However, I quickly realized that I preferred the text version. Though much has been made of Mr. Obama's incredible speaking skills (he even won a Grammy for the audiobook), in my opinion, his words are MUCH better on the page. (Which is, perhaps, saying a lot?)     It's also important to know that the audiobook is pretty seriously abridged. Two chapters have been completely eliminated (criminal, considering the book only has 10 chapters), and the remaining chapters have been condensed, eliminating various details and personal anecdotes. After investing 6+ hours, I'd be annoyed to find that the book I experienced wasn't the same book everyone else experienced. How they convinced the author to do this to his own work, I do not know.    Other reviewers have covered the content of the book, so I won't repeat their efforts here, except to say that Mr. Obama shows a clear talent for (and refreshing respect for) thoughtful problem-assessment. Though he offers few concrete solutions to the problems he discusses, that's not a negative, as it is clearly not his intention to do so. (After all, the book is not subtitled \\"How to Reclaim the American Dream.\\") Instead, his essays are presented as substantial food-for-thought (and hopefully fuel for action).     The fact that so many reviewers have complained of the lack of solutions just goes to show how desperately we want them, and how important we think real solutions are. Yet every day, we perpetuate a style of politics and political discourse that doesn't focus on-- or seem able to produce-- real, viable solutions. Mr. Obama's book  reminds us that liberal or conservative, the solutions we hope for are not going to magically come about unless we find a new (or perhaps old?) way to talk about, and achieve, what we want.     The thesis of the book is not so much \\"We need to do this, this and this!!\\" as it is \\"Our problems are real but solvable-- if we can manage to think clearly.\\"

1934997005|5.0|Okay I am a bit embarrassed; how have I gotten to this age without having read this vital book? Well, I am a bit behind on my reading (the stack of books waiting to be read looks almost big enough to ski down), so when I saw this audiobook version of Darwin's classic, I could not resist. The original text (with original title, by the way: the word \\"On\\" later being dropped by Darwin), abridged and read by Professor Richard Dawkins: what could be better? Dawkins presents this material, about which he is quite passionate, and reads it in his always-pleasant, somewhat musical voice. This book--and I know this is cliche--should truly be read by everyone, and this is a very agreeable way to expose oneself to this brilliant material.
0375703764|3.0|Mark Z. Danielewski, the author, does some very complex and interesting things.<br /><br />Much of his book is supposed to be a mock-academic treatise written by a strange, blind man.  The academic text is heavily footnoted, and while some of the footnotes are by the blind man, Danielewski suggests that others were written by a mentally-unstable man, a tattoo-shop employee who found the academic treatise after its blind author died.  Many of these footnotes go on for many pages, are written in a wild, sometimes incomprehensible stream-of-consciousness style, and are meant to detail the tattoo-employee's descent into madness as he becomes increasingly obsessed with the blind man's academic treatise.<br /><br />Are you following this so far?  It's a pretty complex book.  But its authors' oddities don't stop there!<br /><br />At several points in the book, the footnotes go wild, involving incredibly long lists of names, appearing in all sorts of places on the page, and sometimes even appearing as mirror images.  At several other points in the book, only a few lines of text appear per page.  In other parts, text runs diagonally down the page, rather than left to right, or text appears in a clump, or words take up most of a line, etc. etc. etc.<br /><br />I don't feel like I'm giving too much away, here.  You'd notice this much if you just quickly paged through the book.<br /><br />And, amazingly, all of these wild visual variations make complete sense, and coincide very well with the stories being told in the mock-academic treatise.  Sometimes the text's appearance gives the impression of a labyrinth, sometimes it gives the impression of climbing, and so on.<br /><br />Notice, so far, I haven't even given any real idea of the book's story or plot!  The book might be considered a horror;  after all, the academic treatise is (roughly speaking) about a scary house that holds a tremendous labyrinth.  Or it might be considered a love story;  it's about the relationships described by the academic treatise and the tattoo-employee.  Overall, it's a very complex book.  If I said much more, I'd be at risk of giving up too much of its game.<br /><br />So why, if the book is so interesting, did I only give it a three star ranking? It was incredibly difficult to read!  The blind man's academic treatise reads, at times, like a ridiculous but very dry treatise, filled with meaningless citations and fake quotations from scholars.  The tattoo-employee's footnotes are crazy.  Written in a stream-of-consciousness style, they sometimes seem poorly written, and often go off on nearly incomprehensible jags.  Further, in this book, you can't always read the text from left to right, as is typical.  Sometimes you have to read up or down the page.  And that takes effort.<br /><br />In general, all of the author's stylistic, visual, and content-driven oddities were rather distracting.

0345495004|3.0|A rather disappointing book after all the hype.  Too much dwelling on Maymah's emotional torture and not enough on the relationship that drove her to leave a conventional life for that of an outcast.  Too little about Frank and I still am not sure why she loved him since she portrayed him as a completely arrogant and self absorbed creature.  The pain of leaving her children was well documented and finally tedious but the joy of being with Frank was stated but not explored.  Too much minutia on financial matters and then all brushed away as she travels and studies and does as she pleases.  Felt there should have been more at the end about Frank to tie up her influence on his life.
B000R7HY0K|3.0|Quentin Tarantino's \\"Death Proof\\" displays a great exploitation film.<br />Kurt Russell stars as a psychotic, maniacal stunt driver. He enjoys high speed pursuits racking up terror, and delivering his sinister glares. The film is really simple in nature, entertaining enough to view a few times over. Slabbing the 'grindhouse' name in order to authenticate its manor may of hurt its success, but it really is a decent worthwhile film. Movies of this nature are becoming rarer, and many are often utter garbage. Always nice to see a decent one.<br /><br />Character development actually happens, and slow moments are only to further develop characters. The movie though relatively moves swiftly, maintaining the classic cars and chases as its focus. The film seems to come in two parts, my first time viewing it I had no idea of the first half. Overall it has been greeted with much air time on many movie channels, check it out. If you like what you see purchase it!
B0010X745K|5.0|Has all of the supernatural effects a horror movie should have.  Starts out with a stormy front moving in and ends with tragedy.  This movie is by far one of the most original I've seen in awhile.  I would suggest this movie for anyone who likes horror with a sci-fi twist.  Very entertaining and well-constructed movie.
B001C4CI8U|5.0|People are going to compare this show to The X-Files.  While superficially the comparison is reasonable, it fails on the whole premise of what is happening in each Fringe episode.  The emphasis of the X-Files was the paranormal, the emphasis of Fringe is fringe science.  I have only seen 6 episodes (more on that later), but Fringe presents things that are not really not too bizarre to actually be discounted only on their \\"face validity\\".    I actually worked with several DARPA programs between 1999 and 2005 as both an adviser and a principal investigator.  When I first attended a DARPA program meeting I thought I was entering a science fiction convention.  I was totally amazed at what was being funded, and how \\"fringe\\" much of it was (go to the DARPA website and peruse the programs).  In 2002, at a meeting with a DARPA director in an attempt to determine if I wanted to join the agency as a program director I was actually told \\"Next week we are going to demonstrate teleportation\\".  Of course, my jaw dropped and was finally assured that this wasn't Star Trek and that they were ONLY going to teletransport one atom.  But, this is DARPA.    Anyway, Fringe presents DARPAesque things in a rather amusing manner and provides reasonable scientific explanation (obviously set for normal US TV viewer consumption) for what is going on.  Dr. Bishop is the perfect character to pull this off.  Even when I was thinking that this was getting too \\"Outer Limits\\" his jovial explanation made me say \\"why not, maybe?\\"      So, I consider Fringe to be an excellent series and I hope that it continues for at least as long as the X-Files.  My only regret is that I didn't \\"find\\" the series until it was well past episode 10 in real time, and I found it on [...].  My hope is that FOX will find a way to get me caught up in some manner before the end of the season.  Otherwise I will have to resort to buying the DVD collection and hope that I can view the final episodes before the start of the new season.    This show really rates 5 stars.
B001I189MQ|5.0|My friends and I went to see this movie not really expecting it to be as ABSOLUTELY AMAZING as it was. I was just in disbelief. We went on and on about it for weeks......Heath Ledger completely stole the show; the Joker was amazing.
031606792X|4.0|Okay, so some of the logic didn't make sense... like why couldn't Benjamin make walls of fire with his \\"nature gift\\" and just burn up the volturi? And how come Zafrina didn't go ahead and make them blind when the volturi were trying to make bella and the clan blind? If stephanie meyer really wanted to.. she could have had Bella and the crew defeat the stupid volturi and perhaps make Edward and Bella the new Queen and King rulers of the vampires haha lol. im just sayin... why not?? i really do think it would have been an even MORE happily ever after if the Volturi were destroyed... thus avenging Irina... they can't just let that go....?  and i did like the ending when edward was FINALLY able to read Bella's mind, and i thought it was the sweetest thing when she said \\"you see no one has ever loved anyone as much as i love you\\" my favorite line...though the whole thing with bellas talent was kind of lame to read about. the whole \\"weight thing\\" and \\"stretching\\" going on.      LASTLY,Does ANYONE ELSE FIND IT IRONIC THAT BELLA'S TALENT CONTRADICTS HER FORMER HUMAN WEAKNESSES?  Bella was always needing so much protection to stay alive, and now she is supposedly protecting everyone. i know the whole private mind thing stayed with her... but its kind ironic that she was always a total disaster waiting to happen around people, and that human trait of hers has flip flopped. i thought SM said that the human talents were supposed to be strengthened in the vampire world... not reversed...

B000TGJ8CQ|2.0|Philip K. Dick adaptations are a tricky science.  Now and then, you'll get genre classics like Blade Runner, A Scanner Darkly, and to a lesser extent Total Recall.  Other times, you'll get Paycheck.  Next falls somewhere in between, with Nicolas Cage starring as Cris Johnson: a two-bit Vegas magician who can see two minutes into the future.  Using this ability to get by via gambling, Cris soon learns that a government agent (Julianne Moore) is after him to use him to track down terrorists and a stolen weapon, but all Cris has on his mind is a mysterious woman (Jessica Biel) whom he keeps seeing visions of.  Next does get off to a great start with some inventive storytelling that actually manages to echo Dick's \\"The Golden Man\\" story of which the film is based, but it sadly veers into a pretty predictable, glossy action yarn that doesn't suit the talents of the otherwise solid director Lee Tamahori (Die Another Day).  The villains (featuring the talented Thomas Kretschmann) get no depth at all, nor do many of the other characters besides Cris, and the film's ending will just leave you infuriated.  Still, Cage is actually pretty good, and Biel is surprisingly good as well, but neither can manage to save this flick.  All in all, Next is a disappointment in terms of being a fan of Philip K. Dick tales, and as a stand-alone sci-fi/actioner, just doesn't offer enough to keep you interested.
B00000JMOF|4.0|Another of my childhood favorite monsters - Frankenstein's monster.  I have to admit I always thought it was the monster that was Frankenstein back in those days.  I thought this was a better movie than the Mummy with Karloff that I reviewed earlier.  At least in this one the monster was prevalent and there was lots of arms outstreched, slow deliberate strides and that unique grunting that characterized all Frankenstein movies.  In all honesty I enjoyed the movie for the classic it was; however I would recommend \\"Abbott and Costello Meet Frankenstein\\" over this the original. In A&C you got the Wolfman and Dracula thrown in as well!  The blaze of glory reference is in the final scene Frankenstein is torched in a windmill by an angry mob (sort of like Col. Mustard in the conservatory with a candle stick, eh?).  I suspect the movie makers never realized that they would have to revive Frankenstein for the many sequels that followed.
B000002I4W|3.0|Although there is no justification for the one star rating, I must confess I do agree with many of the last reviewers points. It is a show-off album  where Coleman's abrasively self-conscious soloing overshadows much rhythmic, let alone melodic chemistry. It is a prime piece of early free jazz indeed, a subgenre that is not without its divinely morbid spirals into atonal bliss, but also not without its rambling, compositional indulgences. There are plenty of innovative moments on the album to justify a place in the history books for students of the craft, though a classic piece of music that does not necessarily make.

B000051YEG|5.0|Serge Gainsbourg never restrained his sexuality; his sensuality bordered on incestuous and taboo. Not surprising for a man that, on national television, told Whitney Houston he wanted to \\"f--k her.\\"    What is surprising, however, is that he created an album sparking with sensuality that is both subdued and tittilating.    Serge Gainsbourg's Histoire de Melody Nelson    Inspired by his encounter with then barely-legal Jane Birkin (who would go on to become his wife), the Frenchman set to create a pseudo-autobiographical album detailing this romance. What Gainsbourg created was a concept album drawing from 18th century classical suites, early funk, and spoken-word lounge, a seemingly mountainous endeavor of varying musical stylings beautifully mended to create a sensational album.    The lyrics, sung in French, added another layer to the recordings.    The words sung, and often times spoken, on Histoire de Melody Nelson enhanced the mood with their shimmering poetic qualities. The words of Gainsbourg rival anything penned by the sensualists Anais Nin or D.H. Lawrence. It is poetry as narrative, deeply profound and always sensual.    In its entirety, the album is a landscape of unbridled lust and its inevitable consummation, perfectly evoked in song and word. It is aural pleasure bordering on dangerous debauchery, which, be it in song or real life, only Gainsbourg knew how to restrain so well by doing nothing of the sort

The moment I realized that they were coming out with the Blu Ray version I promptly sold my DVD version and pre-ordered this set on Amazon. The advantages over the DVD version are as follows<br />1. 1080p full HD quality<br />2. DTS-HD Master Audio<br />3. English Subtitles (the DVD one had only Spanish)<br />4. Tons of extras like PIP commentary, Interactive guides and maps ...<br /><br />For me these were good enough reasons to own this masterpiece !!<br /><br />I have this set today in my hands !! Great packaging ... more or less like the DVD version .. just bit smaller !!<br />Amazing A/V quality !!! Way better than the DVD version of course !!<br /><br />Conclusion: Must have even for a casual enthusiast ... and an absolute must for those hardcore fans !! Go get it !! Can't beat Amazon's price !!
B0014DBZT2|4.0|The Bad Seeds have returned.    Nick Cave has been a busy man as of late. Last year saw him front and release a record with his new band, Grinderman (although it was really an extension of the Bad Seeds), where Cave returned to his guitar roots. The self-titled debut is definitely worth a purchase.    And earlier this year, Cave & the Bad Seeds released Dig, Lazarus, Dig!!!, easily one of the best albums of 2008.    Incorporating many of the elements of Grinderman, Cave has seemingly abandoned the piano for the guitar, freeing him, according to his own admission, to focus more as a rock vocalist. It will be interesting to see which direction Cave & the Bad Seeds take from here.    Dig it yourself.

I find myself drawn in and able to read for hours on end. The notes and articles are engaging, thought provoking, and enlightening. This has become my favorite version of all the study Bibles I have had over my 50+ years, including Scofield, Thompson, MacArthur, Stanley, Hayford, and others.

B001AEF6IQ|5.0|\\"Torchwood\\" is to \\"Doctor Who\\" like \\"The Dark Knight\\" is to \\"Batman;\\" same source material, but different.  Dark, intense and incredibly funny; Torchwood is for adults who like SF with a British/Welsh accent.  Doctor Who can be intense, just not as consistently or deeply as Torchwood.  Yes, there is sex in the series and 95 percent of it is heterosexual.  I've gulped a couple of times at how graphic they sometimes make it, but I figure I'm just not use to it.  The homosexual sex is pretty much limited to intense \\"snogging\\" (kissing.)  There is no \\"gay adgenda\\" in the show, just diverse people doing their diverse thing.  BTW, I'm a 54 y.o., heterosexual, American woman who selfishly wishes John Barrowman was straight and a little older; he's gorgeous and, from what I've seen on the DVDs and his website, is as sweet as he can be. Hooray, Torchwood!
B001ECQ75A|5.0|This is an excellent family film.  If you like kung fu movies or comedies, Kung Fu Panda is the movie for you. This film features good voice work from Jack Black and Dustin Hoffman.  The animation is beautiful. I love the extra features included on this DVD.  There is a feature called Dragon Warrior Academy.  This is a series of  fun games you can play with your remote or mouse.  The goal of these games is to complete these tasks to become the dragon warrior.  There is a commentary with the directors of the movie.  There is also an interesting documentary featuring chef Alton Brown. This feature shows a Chinese chef making noodles.  There is even a feature about how to use chopsticks.  This makes me hungry.  My favorite feature though is the Dreamworks Juke Box on this DVD. I love listening and watching the songs and videos from other Dreamworks movies like Shrek 2 and Bee Movie.  Kung Fu Panda is one of the best family movies of the year.  I love this DVD.

He would have made the movie better and I know a image of him was in the begining but I would like a sequel to this film. It would be called TMNT: The Return of The Shredder. It is so action packed, every time I watch it in bed I fall asleep. I like the part when Donatello is arguing with a customer about a computer service and mistake it for a man (who is actually a woman when he goes \\"sir. Sorry 'Mam'\\"). The parts with Raphel fighting on his bike reminds me of Ghost Rider. So get this film.

B000W8OM5Y|5.0|Critique of Braveheart       Mel Gibson's Braveheart is an epic film that brings to life the struggle of the thirteenth century Scotts. The people of Scotland rallied behind a brave man, William Wallace (Mel Gibson), to try and gain their freedom from the English. The film is filled with combat, strong will, love, and even a little humor. Not only is the story line unforgettable but also the cinematography and details of the movie are impeccable. The acting and scripting are masterful. The special effects utilized in the battle scenes are extremely graphic although very well done. Braveheart won countless awards in 1996, the most prestigious being Best Picture and Best Director at the Oscars. Mel Gibson was not only the leading role in this film, but also the director and the producer. Braveheart is not for those faint of heart yet many would enjoy the energy and excitement of the battlefield because the movie was made skillfully.       Throughout the entire film the cinematography plays an important role. Even at the very beginning when the camera soars over the green hills, the audience begins to appreciate the wondrous land of Scotland. The land is green and untouched by modernity, which is perfect for the setting of the story. Scottish bagpipes play in the background as the camera dips and dives over the vast mountain ranges. All this beauty is one of the reasons why the Scotts fight so vehemently to protect their heritage and homes and freedom.        The camera also plays an important role portraying the characters' emotions. It slows down and zooms into the actors' faces so that the audience is able to see the pain, love, or sadness. Mel Gibson did a wonderful job selecting actors for his movie. The actors he chose are so good that one can truly see the emotions running through their minds in their eyes. The suburb acting is what makes this movie extraordinary. Mel Gibson, in addition to his good looks, does an amazing job as Scottish rebel leader William Wallace.  Not only does he inspire the loyalty of his troops with his speeches, but the audience is motivated as well. Wallace's two chief lieutenants, played by Brendan Gleeson and David O'Hara provide a much needed humorous break to the constant fighting.        Strong actresses play both of the women that capture Wallace's love. Catherine McCormack performs the role of Wallace's wife and true love, Murron. The beautiful Sophie Marceau portrays Princess Isabelle. Both of these characters are women of strong will, especially for the time period. Murron's affection for Wallace is tangible in the genuine way she looks at him and her devotion to marry him in secret. She takes a huge risk by defying the English's barbaric orders to bed a bride on the first night of her union. McCormack does an amazing job showing the sincerity and purity of that love. Their relationship, unfortunately, ends in tragedy, which in turns fuels Wallace's (Gibson) fire for revenge on the English. This event signifies the start of a revolt led by Wallace.       The thirteenth century style of fighting was hand-to-hand combat; as a result, the battle scenes are extremely graphic. One can see limbs and heads chopped off, throats slit, and of course all the blood is included. This movie is not for those who go faint at the sight of blood. However, the special effects are done exceptionally well. Many horses were also used in the battle scenes. Using animals is difficult but it gives the movie a feeling of authenticity. In addition, thousands of extras were used in the battle scenes as well as peasants in the villages. The droves of soldiers are well organized just as a true army would be. As one the English archers send a rain of arrows on the Scottish, which demonstrates the superb directing abilities of Gibson.       I have only a few negative critiques of this film. The first is the length of the movie. The film runs two hours and fifty-nine minutes. The film does a good job keeping the attention of the audience, yet at the end one starts to loose interest. It is one battle too many. One becomes dull to all the gory fighting and it does not stir up the same feelings of suspense that the earlier ones did. However, the film finishes strongly with the scene of Wallace's execution. Wallace courageously screams \\"freedom\\" despite torture and imminent death. Secondly, it is difficult to follow the historical events and players the first time watching Braveheart. There are many different noblemen both Scottish and English to keep track of. This becomes easier with the subsequent viewings.        Braveheart, a memorable film, connects the audience to the struggle of the thirteenth century Scotts for freedom. The leader of the revolt, William Wallace (Gibson), inspires the viewers as well as the discontented Scottish clans to his cause, freedom. This film has strong themes of love, self-determination, and fortitude. The skill of the cinematographers and actors is remarkable and takes this movie to the award-winning level.

068987474X|4.0|This is one of those books that spells out for us what we already know deep down inside: whether or not a guy is truly \\"ours\\".<br /><br />On some level most women do understand this, but some fail to identify this truth and apply it.  They may be in denial, they may find a challenging man irresistible, etc.<br /><br />By the time you are making excuses for a man (he's busy, he's shy, he's afraid of commitment, etc) the embers are already dying and the cause is already lost.<br /><br />I hate to quote a Sex and the City character, but it IS liberating once you understand this concept.  Once you respect that it is the man's \\"job\\" to pursue you, you will rest easy and no longer labor or struggle to make a relationship work.  In short, the relationship shouldn't be \\"work\\" for the woman, and if it is, then something is wrong.<br /><br />I would not call this book ground-breaking, but it is a good primer that sheds light on the male-female dynamic.<br /><br />This is the kind of book that can spell out for you the very thing that you may be failing to articulate for yourself.
0205632645|1.0|how else do you explain the price of this \\"special edition,\\" totally unnecessary and, i would argue, totally against the spirit of the contents of the book (which deserves 5 stars in its original form). this is the publishing world's equivalent of repackaging and re-releasing musical hits of dead musicians in order to cash in on them again and again.
1596680296|3.0|This book is meant for DPNs and not for circular needles. So if you want to learn to use DPNs to knit a sock this is a really nice book! I actually really like the photos and instructions and tips given in the book. They are detailed and for a self-taught beginner knitter like me learning to use DPNs, very nice.     The only issue which I felt was important, which was not really addressed in the book was using the circular needle method to knit socks. With the growing use of circular needs to knit fast and quick in tubes (as well as to get the weight off the knitter's wrists!) I think it's important to show knitters the basics of how to knit at least 1 sock (if not 2 socks) with at least 1 circular needle.  There is only a tiny section (a third of a page) that tells you about the basic idea of using 1 circular needle to knit socks. The rest of the book focuses only on using DPNs. Patterns are also all for DPNS.   That's ok, if a knitter just wants to learn to knit with DPNs. Also, for beginner knitters like me who want to also have a look at how to knit with 1 circular needle, it's almost impossible to \\"convert\\" the knitting patterns by myself to work on circulars, without a lot of trials.    I know that DPNs are sometimes so called the \\"original method.\\" However, i think in this time and age, when one can knit using 1 needle and can knit not just 1 but 2 socks at one time, why only learn to use 4 needles to knit 1 sock?    I understand that there are some knitters who prefer using DPNs and that's ok, but it would also be good to include proper instructions and patterns for the use of circular needles to knit socks. After all, DPNs and Circular needles are the 2 main methods used to knit socks.

The mask alone won't really work if you tried to put it on a shelf with normal DVD's. It's about the width of two normal DVD cases, a little larger. If you keep the clear plastic box it comes with, you could easily display it alongside the rest of your DVD collection. Or, if you so wished, I'm sure you could figure out a way to hang the mask on a wall for display.
B001DDBCV4|4.0|The movie is fun, especially for long-time fans. There are many layers -  it was nice to watch it at home and let it all sink in. I bought the Blu-Ray version of the film - while there's no denying that it looks great, the extras weren't as exciting as touted in the description. There's barely any additional footage - deleted scenes or otherwise and there's still no explanation of Stanford's paltry storyline. Also, no \\"cutting room floor\\" extras of the rumored Aiden storyline. I was expecting a lot more, but still enjoyed the actual film. You aren't missing anything by purchasing the DVD version, as far as I can tell. And you'll save a few bucks!
140120306X|5.0|Not just a comic book, this is, for the most part, the titular Black Dossier.  Not a place for anyone who hasn't read a League book before to start with the series, but a truly exciting follow-up for fans.  Alan Moore mimics everything from Shakespeare to Kerouac in a book that changes styles every few pages and keeps the reader on their toes, to say the least. Definitely my favourite of the three so far, and am looking forward to \\"Century\\" next year.  If you didn't like the back-ups in the last two volumes (Allan and the Sundered Veil & the New Traveller's Almanac) then this may not be your cup of tea.
B000YABYLA|3.0|Juno is the story of a young girl who accidentally becomes pregnant in high school.  Her demeanor is funny, her attitude is positive.    There are charming jokes all the way through, and the teenage girl never ceases to do something shocking.    I however did not like the manner in which she was portrayed in relationship to a male role model in the film.  The couple that has come forward to adopt the unborn child has issues of their own, and Juno, unfortunately, becomes placed in the middle of these problems.    All in all, in the end I was pleased, Juno's boyfriend is my favorite character. The cast chosen for this film was excellent.  I am looking forward to seeing them each individually advance in their movie careers.
B000MR9D5E|4.0|I wish I got it in Blu-Ray. The material is absolutely worth it. I would recommend getting it in Blu-Ray and not miss the very little details. It's beautiful Planet Earth.
B000YABIQ6|5.0|Thoroughly enjoyed this DVD at a great price.  Can't wait for the second season to come out on DVD.
B000KKPN5C|5.0|The SB-400 complements my Nikon D40 and gets great results. Nikon digital cameras automatically control the power output of the SB-400 for great results  every time.  I bought this speedlight  for the ability to use bounce lighting for great photos. The speedlight can be tilted up in various degrees to get the results you want. This product fills my needs and the price is right.
B000DWMN2S|5.0|What a great movie!  The characters are funny and likeable.  The story is so funny and human then takes an incredibly poignant turn.
1416594884|5.0|A top notch story from a master. Intricate plot, fascinating characters, all the twists and turns to keep you guessing, then hoping until the end. I loved it!
B001GQ2TGA|5.0|1. And Winter Came...   In one word: NICE   I'm not a huge fan of AWC. It's a nice song, sure...but it's also Midnight Blue. The vocal additions are a great added effect, but it's the new, full richness that pushes this song up a point for me.  *****5 of 10*****    2. Journey of the Angels   In one word: SOARING   JOTA is the first song in which we get a taste of Eithne's newfound vocal majesty. Her voice has matured to new levels and she can control the tone quality and the richness with the precision of a finely-tuned thermometer. The lyrics are nice and Christmas-y. The way Eithne sings \\"angels\\" is lovely, as well.  ********8 of 10********    3. White Is in the Winter Night   In one word: GLEEFUL   WIITWN is surely the song most likely to put Enya on the radio every year during the holidays. It's upbeat, peppy, and gleeful. Green is in the mistletoe! Red is in the holly! This song gives me powerful, visible chills when it gets to the end. The last lines--\\"Have you heard the choir singing? / Glory! Glory! Glory!\\"--never fail to send a shiver down my spine. A fantastic song overall.  **********10 of 10**********    4. O Come, O Come, Emmanuel   In one word: HAUNTING   I knew OCOCE would be wonderful when I heard the very first clip on the EPK at [...] I am definitely not disappointed! The one word to describe this word is haunting or chilling because of the vocals. Eithne has returned in this song to the eerie quality of past songs like \\"Exile\\" and \\"Evening Falls,\\" and it works perfectly for this song. The random choral vocalizations and \\"Gaude!\\" explosions contribute to the haunting quality of this song and often give me chills. The use of English and Latin together appeals to my linguistic obsession very nicely, as well. One nice, tiny detail in the effects department is the use of the bell on the very last note, which is the release of the last \\"Emmanuel\\" (approximately at 3:22). Brilliant work.  **********10 of 10**********    5. Trains and Winter Rains   In one word: CHANGE   TAWR was the first taste of \\"And Winter Came...\\" that fans got, and I attached to it instantly. The pizzicato in the strings always adds a tasteful effect to Enya's music, and the percussion (particularly the timpani [I believe that's what they are]). The \\"da da da da\\" eighth notes in the background help push the song forward. The chorus, when the tone goes from dark to light, is a great release of the chords that warms me from the inside out. The lyrics fit the music perfectly.  ********8 of 10********    6. Dreams Are More Precious   In one word: NEO-TRADITIONAL   DAMP was one of the first full songs of \\"And Winter Came...\\" that was available. It's a great song that speaks to more traditional carols lyrically (like \\"Adeste, Fideles\\" in my opinion). This is surely the richest song she's ever done. The lines \\"and I'll keep watch for you / until the dawn is breaking through / until the morning wakens you\\" are very poetic and rhythmic.  *******7 of 10*******    7. Last Time by Moonlight   In one word: MOVING   I love LTBM more than any Enya song I've heard (i.e. all of them). The chorus is surely the most brilliant part of the song, but it's all fantastic. It's very reminiscent of WSTHH from the musical accompaniment. Its powerful lyrics provide a mixture of sorrow and hope at the same time, both condemning a relationship (\\"but nothing is forever / not even / the starlight at midnight / not even the moonlight\\") and adding a touch of optimism in the chorus (\\"oooh, remember this / for no-one knows / the way love goes\\"). Definitely my favourite on the album and my favourite Enya song to date.  **********10 of 10**********    8. One Toy Soldier   In one word: CHILDLIKE   OTS really achieves Enya's goal of bringing people back to the simple times of childhood, if only for 3:54. That alone earns this song most of its points, yet there's another aspect that pushes it up even further. The lyrics tell a story sequentially, almost as a fairy tale narrates. A small toy soldier with a broken drum needs his drum fixed, or he can't play in the morning to announce the arrival of Christmas! How can he keep the beat of marching feet with a broken drum? The soldier is deeply distressed about this in his heart, yet by the end of the song, the problem is resolved. Simply delightful!  *********9 of 10*********    9. Stars and Midnight Blue   In one word: ROMANTIC   This is one of the best songs on the album by far. The vocals in SAMB are--without a doubt in my mind--the best Eithne's voice has ever sounded. It's rich, full, and compassionate. It oozes emotion like the icing in a layer cake. The lyrics are a completely different realm of beauty. I have always felt that Roma's lyrics have never quite measured up to her poetry from the two editions of WSTHH. This isn't a bad thing, as it's difficult to make poetry align with a premade melody. Yet these lyrics are moving, passionate, romantic, and poetic. \\"Once you filled my hands with roses / then you gave your heart to me / when a kiss ahd followed this / love was meant to be.\\" \\"You have lost yourself in dreaming / I have lost myself in you / now we lie beneath the sky; / stars and midnight blue.\\" Sheer and utter romantic love. I love it so much, in fact, that it may soon take over the number one overall Enya song spot on my favourites list.  **********10 of 10**********    10. The Spirit of Christmas Past   In one word: MELODIC   The melody in TSOCP is very delightful. Her voice develops yet another quality, and her voice just leaks optimism like air from a tire. The lyrics aren't particularly enchanting, but they match the melody perfectly in compensation. There are still a few lines that are great, though, like \\"So, let the shadows go / and drift away like snow.\\" Beautiful song!  ********8 of 10********    11. My! My! Time Flies!   In one word: HAPPY   You can truly hear Eithne smiling in MMTF. It's a great song with great percussion. The guitar parts are interesting (to say the very least), yet not unappealing. They are very new, however, and very different. The references to past pop culture is a very nice addition in the lyric, akin to OF's \\"with Rob Dickens at the wheel\\" and \\"Ross and his dependencies.\\" The vocals are full of falls and rises similar to glissandos and reverse glissandos. The ending is fantastic.  *******7 of 10*******    12. Oíche Chiúin [Chorale]   In one word: CHOIR   OCC is the way OC should've been done the first time! I enjoy the original version; however, it has been released upwards of eighty times in the US (perhaps an exaggeration, but you get the point), and I am somewhat tired of seeing the original on everything almost as a filler track. This reworking is a brilliant production with full vocals and a true choir-of-one sound.  ******6 of 10******    SUMMARY:    10 stars: WIITWN, OCOCE, LTBM, and SAMB  9 stars: OTS  8 stars: JOTA, TAWR, and TSOCP  7 stars: DAMP and MMTF  6 stars: OCC  5 stars: AWC     THE PHYSICAL ALBUM:   The album is done very tastefully and professionally. It comes shrink-wrapped and with a red sticker on the wrapping. On the sticker is printed: \\"BRAND NEW ALBUM featuring \\"TRAINS AND WINTER RAINS\\" and \\"WHITE IS IN THE WINTER NIGHT / Also features traditional holiday songs, including a new version of \\"SILENT NIGHT (OÍCHE CHIÚIN [CHORALE])\\" / [...]\\" (all in black except for \\"BRAND NEW ALBUM\\" in white) superimposed on the white \\"enya\\" logo. The text breaks to leave room for the \\"enva\\" part of the logo.0   The disc itself is light blue in the US (Crayola would call it robin's-egg-blue or sky blue) with the \\"enya\\" logo in white. \\"And Winter Came...\\" is written right below the logo and to the left, before the \\"y\\" of \\"enya.\\" The back of the album features the track listin in a nice, clear font in dark blue or black.   The booklet has the \\"enya\\" logo in metallic red, which is a delightful touch. The fonts are all clear and crisp. I think the lyrics are written in very dark blue, but it may be black. I'm very, VERY glad to see the lyrics in here. The colours of this release work very well together--a treat that hasn't been seen since ADWR. The pictures are gorgeous and very high quality. My favourite is opposite the last page of lyrics (featuring TSOCP, MMTF, and OCC). It's the image from the Norwegian (IIRC) site of Enya in the purple dress looking up at the camera from a tile floor with flower petals all around. I'm very glad to see the line, \\"Thanks also to all our Moderators, both past and present.\\" It's great to see Enya commending the hard work Nigello and TC do to keep us in line! Also, all three of the Trio's websites [...] are listed.
B000SINT52|5.0|Great movie.  Really brings to the forefront behind the scene politics.  Gets one thinking about issues one would probably never think about.  Moore really does a great job of making people aware.  I've seen only two of his projects but have enjoyed both.
B001GQ2TGA|5.0|I know some said this is Enya's best work up to date -- and they're almost right, in my opinion: I think \\"Watermark\\" will always be my favourite Enya album. That said, \\"And Winter Came...\\" is DEVASTATINGLY GOOD.    \\"And Winter Came\\": I already loved the track when it was called \\"Midnight Blue\\", I love it even more now -- the new vocals turn it into a completely different piece. It's a strong opening song, it really gets you in a wintery, peaceful mood.    \\"Journey of the Angels\\" reminded me of \\"Angeles\\" (from the album \\"Shepherd Moons\\"): great melody, great vocal arrangement, great lyrics. That's the track that reminded me of Enya's earlier days the most -- even though the WHOLE album is more similar to \\"Watermark\\" than to \\"A Day Without Rain\\".    \\"White is in The Winter Night\\" is utterly cheerful and I know I'll find myself singing it on Christmas day.    \\"O Come O Come Emmanuel\\" is haunting, especially the long and loud \\"aah\\" after the first verse. Lovely.    \\"Trains and Winter Rains\\" is an excellent first single, and it's POP at its most refined.    \\"Dreams are More Precious\\" should be released as a single, too: it has big potential. Superb vocal arrangement.    I think \\"Last Time By Moonlight\\" is going to be my favourite song on this album. Perfect melody (one that Mama Cass could sing), excellent arrangement, great vocals, insightful lyrics. The Trio did a great job on this one: it's flawless (not that the other songs are full of flaws, of course -- but this one's particularly appealing to my ears and brain).    \\"One Toy Soldier\\" is a very cute song! Roma Ryan did a great job on this one: the lyrics might sound sorta childish when you first listen to the song, but it quickly grew on me.    \\"Stars And Midnight Blue\\" reminded me of \\"A Moment Lost\\" (from \\"Amarantine\\"), which is a track I like a lot -- but it definitely sounds more mature and better produced.    \\"The Spirit of Christmas Past\\" is going to be my second favourite on the album. Another clever, soothingmelody.    \\"My! My! Time Flies!\\" is another flawless song: it's different from what we've heard up to now, but you can still tell it's Enya, sweet lovely Enya. The lyrics are witty and priceless! Being an Enya fan, I knew the Beatles and B.B. King would be referred to in the song -- but I didn't know Isaac Newton would be, too. Lovely. Oh, and there's a great guitar solo at the end of the song -- something you don't hear very often in an Enya song! I love the ending line: \\"... could be tomorrow but then/ could be 2010.\\"    The new \\"chorale\\" version of \\"Oiche Chiuin\\" is spectacular, luxuriant as the virgin forest, uber-cool. I like it as much as the version they recorded in 1988.    That's all.
0066620996|5.0|Jim Collins and his team of researchers have surveyed over 1,400 companies, systematically analysed  6,000 publicly available articles, and carried out numerous face to face interviews with senior managers. The finding, the single most important factor to the health of a company - Leadership. The author asserted that they purposely steer away from such attribute as there are no shortage of business books paying the same platitude.     Every company vision statement reads like the next one. When did anyone last read a company which doesn't claim its employee is its greatest asset ? Yet, most see it fit to outsource its most critical function - finding the \\"right people\\". If every great company gets it right, there wouldn't be much of a recruitment industry. Recruitment agents will becomes redundant. It is the responsibility of every employee to find the right co-workers. Wait, isn't Google doing exactly that ? Jack Welch, John Chambers, Bill Gates and Warren Buffett have all said their main job was to find the right people. Hire the right people first, then create a position to suit the person. Find passionate people, find people with integrity, find someone who would run the company like he/she owns it, hire this person straight away. This is how the author puts it,    \\"Widen your definition of \\"right people\\" to focus more on the character attributes of the person and less on specialised knowledge. People can learn skills and acquire knowledge, but they can not learn the essential characters traits that make them right for your organisation.\\"    Since the publication of Good to Great it has attracted some criticism, primarily for its selection of what's on the Great company list. Much of the companies have since fallen on hard time, a few short years after its publication. Those views are some what misplaced. Good to Great doesn't give investment advice. It study the companies and the people that runs them, and dismissed a few myths along the way. Great leaders areoften media shy, less worry about management \\"buy in\\" and much prefer hearing the truth, and definitely less charismatic than the media like to portray. A CEO should be working for the good of the company, and less about building his/her own personal profile. The big personality, the management superstar, the hyper arrogant (often misunderstood as self confidence) work against an environment in which employee are encouraged to take calculated risks, and find innovative solutions.
B000HT3PPG|5.0|My boyfriend's been looking for a B&W copy of this in DVD format - and this has both! A nice surprise!
0805079831|1.0|Just a few things off the top of my head I find wrong with this book.      1. Friedman opposed the Vietnam and Iraq Wars.  2. Friedman opposed the IMF's actions in Asia.  3. Friedman visited Argentina 2 years after Pinochet's bloody coup.  4. Pinochet requested help from Friedman economists after his economy was failing and still didn't start reforms for several years.  5. Chinese students gathered at Tiananmen Square to mourn the death of the Secretary General who was a market reformer.    the list goes on and on.  This book was written to be marketed to the left because Naomi Klien new it would sell well, truth be damned.
0142501123|5.0|As a Calif kindergarten teacher and mother of a 3 year old, I love this book.  The story is engaging and witty; I find that I'm the one pulling out the book night after night (which also thrills my little one!).  As a teacher, I love the rhymes (a challenging concept for my students in the first two months of school) and the predictable pattern keeps the children engaged and thinking about what comes next.
B001GKJ2DO|5.0|Watching this movie is like visiting a seaside amusement park with its ferris wheel and whirling carousel-strolling through a gaudy and brightly colored penny arcade-feasting on cotton candy and salt water taffy-walking barefoot on the sand with your own dancing queen.  Thirty years on the songs of ABBA are still delightful and deliciously infectious as ever and elevate this paper-thin wisp of a story. The main thrust of the movie is a young bride-to-be(Sophie) anxious to find out which of her mothers(Donna) three lovers is her dad. Unlike the original show which made it obvious who the dad was, the movie does not settle the question and instead all three potential dads declare each is 1/3 Sophies father.    Meryl Streep playing Donna is wonderful and takes a break from her usual more serious roles and is obviously having a ball.  A new actress named Amanda Seyfried as Sophie is a real find and she is the best singer in the movie.  Unfortunatly one of her songs \\"The Name of the Game\\" was cut from the film and was presumably sung after she has a spat with her husband-to-be,Sky.  The next time you see the pair they are as happy as clams so both the missing song and the missing subsequent making-up scene leaves a gap in the movie. But why complain? The movie is so vibrant and perky and loaded with some of ABBAS' best songs, fun performances, colorful costumes and scenery the lapse is but a breeze in a hurricane of entertainment.    I can't end this without a mention of the much maligned Pierce Brosnan and his attempted homicide of singing.  I think I have solved the problem-he sings through his nose suffering from a headcold.  However I have to give him props for his brave and not bad at all rendition of \\"When All is Said and Done\\"-nose and all.    Very nice movie and if you can't have ABBA at least you have some of their biggest hits delightfully performed.
1416955070|5.0|Cassandra Clare's City of Bones is a riveting story that I couldn't put down, and didn't want to put down! From page one, I was completely ensnared. There was just something in the way Clare set up the opening for us that leaves the air thick with tension, and the reader saying, \\"Okay, something is going to go down.\\" I swear, I can't pinpoint exactly what it was that had me so captivated. This is just one of those books that you either absolutely fall over loving, or you puke your guts out hating. I fell hard.<br /><br />CITY OF BONES begins in a club in New York named Pandemonium. There we meet Clary, short for Clarissa, and her best friend Simon. Clary is witness to a brutal murder, although she seems to be the only one who CAN see this killing out of an entire club packed with sweating dancers. This event is a catalyst that sends her life spiraling into a territory she never knew existed, and she will be surprised to find she is a major part of it. I thought that the pacing of the novel was amazing. It created an action-y atmosphere, while of course throwing romance and teetering friendships into the mix.<br /><br />I know, I've been reduced to a fan girl.<br /><br />Jace was (of course) my favorite character. I'm a total bad boy lover, and Jace's sarcastic wit and humor, as well as all-around badassness just made him irresistible. I actually loved all the characters.<br /><br />Yes, yes I know this is a gushing review, but to be honest, City of Bones is absolutely one of my favorite books. It's one of those books that you don't come by very often, and that you didn't really have any issues with after reading it. Truly, this is a very rare occurrence with me, as I'm a rather large snob when it comes to novels, but I loved CoB.<br /><br />Anyone who picks up CITY OF BONES is in for a thrill ride, jam packed with obstacles and impossibilities galore. Clare creates a delectable tale full of twists and turns that even J.K. Rowling would be envious of. And, seriously, that cover. Yum.that cover. Yum.
0440243661|5.0|Fans of David Morrell, Richard Stark (Donald Westlake), and F. Paul Wilson's brawny thrillers will love Lee Child's laconic loner hero. Featured in ten previous novels, Jack Reacher is a shiftless vagabond who owns nothing and lives nowhere and everywhere. A former military policeman and Army special investigator, he is also a knight-errant of sorts, using his experience, large body, and suppressed violent disposition to right wrongs for people who can't. Like a masterless ronin, he's not \\"in the system,\\" using the names of obscure baseball players as aliases. But in this newest novel, Child throws Reacher a curve, reuniting him with a group of tightly-knit \\"special investigators\\" gathered to find out what happened to their four missing and murdered comrades - and to make someone pay. Reacher's loner personality is tested when he must fit into a team system once again. Watching this quiet, dangerous giant of a man interact with fellow ex-soldiers is almost as interesting as watching the elite unit follow nebulous clues to uncover the reason one of their own was tortured and tossed out of a helicopter. Once hooked, chances are you'll go back for those previous Reacher books featuring this engaging modern judge, jury, and sometime executioner.<br /><br />--W.D. Gagliani, author of Savage Nights
0321344758|4.0|Very useful information, but like many books bogs down a little on the back end.  Other than that, the book practices what it preaches.  I've given my copy to our web design team and plan to see it passed around.
038534273X|2.0|The book is informative in a factual sense but the author's tone is gushing to the point that it's distracting.  This is not an evenhanded chronicle of Google's history - it's a fairly shallow, idealized account of Page, Brin, Schmidt and Google.  The book would be much more interesting if it was balanced.

B001DTPZNY|3.0|I vividly recall seeing the original Raiders on opening night back in 1980 not realizing what a phenomenon it would become. It became a tradition for me to see each of the sequels opening day as well--and when I discovered that Crystal Skull was actually IN production, I remember thinking to myself, \\"I'm going to LOVE this movie no matter WHAT.\\"<br /><br />Unfortunately, reality has a way of making me swallow my words--but I discovered crow ain't so bad once you get past the feathers...the film, on the other hand, left a LOT to be desired. Now first, let me say that aside from the ending, I really enjoyed this movie a LOT. My initial reaction to seeing Harrison all decked out as Indy was a bit of a shock as I thought, \\"Holy CRAP he looks old!\\" But I got over that rather quickly as I became enveloped in the story.<br /><br />I don't CARE how believable the story is, as long as it stays within the Indy-frame of reference of what has gone before and manages to entertain me. For the vast majority of the movie I honestly was on the edge of my seat (as were my 6 & 4 year old sons who count this one of the greatest examples of movie-making in history...). I believe, and I think that I am NOT alone in this, that when it comes to the supernatural that we have come to expect from the Indiana Jones franchise, the success or failure of these movies relies heavily upon the phrase, \\"Less Is More\\". HINTING that aliens exist is one thing, it is another to just force it down our throats. Again, other than the outlandish ending which was about as far from what we have come to expect from the three previous films as you can get, I seriously enjoyed Crystal Skull a LOT.<br /><br />The inclusion of Marion was nothing short of genius if you ask me. It was unfortunate that Sean Connery couldn't be convinced to give Henry Jones Sr. another try, but despite that, the story was thoroughly engaging all the same. The atomic blast at the beginning was stretching it by quite a bit, but I found myself entertained even so. Was it even remotely believable? Of course not, but then again, does anyone really believe the Ark opening scene from Raiders could really happen...? Didn't think so. It's a MOVIE for heavens sake--and yet as I realized that hinting at aliens was not going to be enough for George Lucas this time around, I had a feeling that something was going to go terribly wrong. I was right.<br /><br />I also realize that I am not necessarily in the majority here as MANY Indy fans actually LOVED the ending, some of which were rather surprised at how it all unfolded. I felt that it was telegraphed early on, so it wasn't that much of a surprise for me...all the while I was hoping that it wouldn't happen as I feared it would--and DID.<br /><br />In short, 97% of the movie was awesome...the last 5 minutes left a sour taste in my mouth if for NO other reason than I felt that leaving us wondering more about the so-called alien connection would have been much more in keeping with the history of Indiana Jones rather than the bold approach of pulling back the curtain and showing it to us in vivid color. Am I wrong? I guess that depends on your opinion, and as I like to remind everyone: opinions vary. I suppose that the last few minutes bothered me enough to revoke two stars from my review, even though up to that point I was really having a great time.so. Was it even remotely believable?

B001ED7C58|3.0|I LOVED the books and i actually preordered this but when i got it i was quite disappointed.<br /><br />The songs besides the Collective Soul and the 1 Paramore song pretty much suck. Stephenie Meyer's soundtrack list is much better! All the songs are just so mediocre, there is no good rock no anything. It feels like someone thought they should throw this together at the last minute.<br /><br />Robert Pattinson sounds like he is singing something from another book like maybe another series. It has a bluesy feel that hasn't got anything to do with the movie. The song sucks cause it has NOTHING to do with the books that i can tell. It doesn't even sound like him.<br /><br />I would give this a 2.5 stars but can't so i made it 3.
B00065F86U|5.0|Works great in combination with the MB-D10 to use the same batteries as the D2 / D3 series cameras.  This is the only way to get the maximum per second shutter rate out of your D700 or D300.    Con:  Should have been included in the MB-D10 box
B001DTPZNY|3.0|This film was a good return for Indy. And a great way to bow before the fans and say good buy.
B00003OSU4|5.0|Jazz on a Summer's Day captures a day in time that for me is magic.  Each musician at the top of his or her game, set for all who lived through that era to enjoy again.  Those too young to have known this time will enjoy seeing some of the Jazz legends of the era.  The Newport Jazz Festival was a legendary meeting of the new and the old.    The open car scenes at the beginning and at the end capture the spirit of the times!
B001CD6FKI|4.0|I am glad I did NOT see this in the theater.  Even on DVD it's \\"too much\\" for these old eyes on first viewing. This is a great movie - on hindsight-  as groundbreaking as The Matrix (and rewatch Matrix, if you haven't seen it lately!)    The W Brothers outdid themselves on this one.  Home Run!  But it may take years for them to receive their kudos.  The movie is faithful to the cartoon (I died when Speed jumped the pose in the second big race!  \\"Oh no he didn't!\\"), but it is a New Thing altogether.  It has it's own mythology and rules of physics.  It moves too fast to catch the artistry of the cuts, wipes, 360-degree shots and performances on first viewing.  You've got to see it twice (it makes sense when you understand \\"the rules\\").  The acting is good, story is top notch for type of movie.  I enjoyed seeing Korean pop star, Rain, too.  Unintelligible vocal accents are another reason to view it twice.      I was very satisfied.  I don't often say that!
1843104954|4.0|A very informative and comprehensive text. This book is a great reference for anybody. It's certainly the best book that I've found for grown-up Aspies. Sometimes it seems like everything else that's been written on Asperger's Syndrome is directed towards \\"parents of children with.\\"
B001ILFUDC|5.0|I am so excited that this title is finally being released first time Platinum Edition. This movie is one of Disney's very best. The animation is so beautiful and detailed. The character development is wonderful and the soundtrack is fantastic. It is amazing to think that at the time it was released in the theaters it was a financial failure. Walt wanted to make sure that the quality of the animation and the movie did not suffer, even if it meant losing money on it, which it did. BUT, through the years the obvious magic of this movie captured so many hearts, that eventually it came on top and made movie making history. So here is to all of us that dare to dream and wish upon a star. Pinoke.... you will forever be in my heart!
B00005JPO1|4.0|Let's face it, you can't really top the original.  The first Indy was a unique and inspiring classic that has spawned many many similar films through the years.  As we found out, even sequels of the same character could not top the first.  So let's look at this one on it's own.  Indiana Jones, is a classic character of modern movies and will live on for years and years.  So it's great just to see him again.  They use his age as a kind of tongue-in-cheek joke throughout and they reunite him with and old love and his son.  The story is a little over the top and there are flaws, but, it provides what Indiana Jones movies are supposed to do; action, thrills, laughs and 2 hours of Saturday Morning serial escapism.  No it's not as good as The Lost Ark, but I thought it was fun to go on the Indiana Jones Express again and just have some fun.
B0019FOC5E|5.0|Well sung and lots of fun, this is a CD where most of songs are well worth listening to.  Both my mother-in-law and my teenage daughter enjoy hearing this in the car, so it has multi-generational appeal - that's rare.
B00005JLR8|5.0|Be strong.  Grab a cup of tea and shut down the computer and phone.  Take deep breaths.  Be ready to fall in love, have your heart broken, and fall in love again before the film is over.  I love this movie....<br /><br />With my high school sophomores, I do a unit on the American Dream.  I love to show them the scene from this film (would show them the movie in its entirety, if I could) where Johnny decides to buy the swamp cooler for their sweltering loft apartment.  If you feel no compassion after what transpires, you are an android, not a human.  I love this movie...<br /><br />When my great-grandparents came from Ireland, they settled on a farm in a rural area.  But their dream was the same... the same as it is for many, many Americans:  We just want to live out our passions in peace and freedom.  This film reminds us that we need each other to do so.  I love this movie....
1591841992|2.0|OK, I'll admit it.  I use the white board a lot.  I thought this book would be a quick hit group of hints to make my life/verbiage/ideas more simple and clear.  I found the book full of lists, like I'm going to be doing some free flowing idea presenting at a whiteboard and still remember some arcane 12 point list.  I'd actually would have given it a 1 star rating, but I know there are some people this would be good for, someone possibly who isn't already jumping out of there chair and fighting for the whiteboard.  If this describes you, my suggestion is skip this book.
B001DUJNGS|2.0|Since the first 4 albums each release seems to loose more and more of what made Enigma's music special. I do not know whether it is a case of just not trying hard enough, or trying to morph into the mainstream musical styles. But this album is very weak and I actually found myself getting bored with it (never thought I'd say that about Enigma!).    It almost feels like the orchestral elements got mixed in at the end to fill the content voids, some of the string stabs just sound really out of place and the vocals just seem to get more reverb and echo with each release as if trying to hide the bland vocal elements.    Please, please return to your roots.
B001GQ2TGA|1.0|Got this yesterday. Two songs are rehashes from extra tracks on previous singles - \\"And Winter Came\\" was previously known as Midnight Blue. \\"Oiche Chuin\\" already released a few times. The other songs are twee, and the whole CD has an air of cynical commercialism about it. There's a huge lack of new ideas, lyrical or melody-wise: lots of repeated lyrical references to midnight chimes and chimes of midnight, and midnight blue etc...  Florida...? Oh, is that the place where the clever folks put The W into the White House? Good job!
B0012GN0FI|5.0|Accept has always been a metalhead's metal band.  One of those bands only a true lover of the genre could actually appreciate fully.  The band had produced several classics in the early 80s,beginning with Breaker(1981) and folowed by two of the greatest metal releases of all time:Restless and Wild(1982) and Balls to the Wall(1983).  This live album captures there performance in Osaka,Japan in 1985 in support of the very good,Metal Heart album.  Most of the bands essentials are played live,including practically definitive versions of \\"Princess of the Dawn\\",\\"Son of a Bitc*\\",\\"Dogs on Leads\\" and \\"Breaker\\".  \\"Fast as a Shark\\" is the best track on here,as it showcases one of Udo's most insane vocal performances.  Amazon does not list \\"Balls to the Wall\\" as being part of the setlist,but it is,and it closes the show beautifully.  Full of energy and fun,Accept's \\"Staying a Life\\" is a wonderful,fun trip to the golden age of metal.  A must for the serious metalhead.
B000BHN7D4|5.0|I discovered Anastacia on you tube and fell in love with her music. I love the CD, especially the track \\"I belong to you\\" and \\"everything burns\\". There isn't a song on the CD that I don't like. Why she is not more popular in the US is beyond me.
B000OVLBFS|5.0|These Jesse Stone series are a great vehicle for Tom Selleck, its good to see him back in action - the stories are great, and suit him to a tee. He has that ability to convince the viewer that he is Jesse Stone - very much a tortured soul.  He is very believable in the role.. it seems like it was written for him. I have all three episodes and enjoy watching them very much - keep wanting more.
B000KX0IOA|5.0|I first saw this movie many years ago in theaters, and a few years after that when I bought it for my library. It was on two VHS tapes in those days, and now 1 DVD has the entire movie. I'm sure everyone knows the story of Gandhi, so I won't go into that.    GANDHI is a long movie (more than 3-hours) so this was my third viewing of it (theater, VHS tapes, and now DVD. Each time I see it, I enjoy it more than the last time, perhaps because I am older and can understand his significance better now. How, through non-violent resistance, he achieved independence for his country (India) from the British Empire, and how he influenced not only his country, but the world by his actions.    Now, more than ever, we Americans should see this movie, because Gandhi, perhaps more than anyone else, influence Doctor Martin Luther King Jr and the Civil Rights Movement in this country that has just seen the ultimate achievement of having a black American elected President of the United States.    Ben Kingsley IS Gandhi. There is nothing to say about the acting in this film, because they are so good in their roles that it is like living through his world. In the Collector's Addition there is an entire second DVD of Special Features that is almost as interesting as the movie itself and that is saying something.    If you are not moved by this film, they need to check your heart, because you died sometime ago.
B001DDBCUU|5.0|I have been waiting for this movie to happen for so long and I wasn't disappointed. It was great seeing the girls again and it just made me realise how much I really missed the series. I do hope that there is another movie, but, I think that maybe there won't be one, seeing how they seemed to tie up all the loose ends - except for Samantha. Once again a great movie, long awaited and for all those Sex and the City fans, one not to be missed.
B00005S6K8|5.0|I loved this movie!!! The original of course is the best, but I must say that Harrison Ford still hasn't lost the touch. I love the actors they used and the paris setting make you want to go visit. You should buy this movie. I watch it every week at least 2X!
B00004R99F|5.0|My 3 year old son loves this movie. He first saw it at his daycare, so I had to get it for him. There's music, singing and \\"goofy\\" things going on amidst a good father/son story. The only thing I found a little off-putting is the reference to the \\"electric chair\\" . Try explaining that to your kids. So far, my son hasn't asked...
1594489505|5.0|This is so beautifully written. Absolutely enthralling and you cannot put it down. The two main characters are so well drawn you can actually feel empathy for them at what they have to endure throughout the story. This is in short..one the best books I have ever read.
B00000IQV7|5.0|I don't understand why people panned this one.  Williams was still a clown but rendered a dramatic performance that was second to none.  Not quite as good as the \\"Fisher King\\" but then he didn't have Jeff Bridges to play off of.
B001AX9DT0|5.0|This is an amazing album all around. Ray LaMontagne is a musical genius with an amazing voice and a knack for making amazing songs. This album incorporates sort of a new style into LaMontagne's routine indie style of music. His new fast paced, upbeat songs are a refresher from the norm. (not that we needed one, we like his regular style just as much!) The new songs bring almost a country feel (is it possible?) to LaMontagne's music. This album is not much like his others.  To compare it to musically, I would say it is similar to \\"Raycharles LaMontagne\\" and somewhat different from \\"Till The Sun Turns Black\\" in the type of songs composing the albums.<br /><br />My favorite song on the album is \\"I Still Care For You\\" because it has the same deep, complex, and faraway epic feel as his song \\"Be Here Now.\\"<br /><br />I highly recommend this album to anyone who likes any of LaMontagne's music, I never get tired of him. I am very happy with my purchase of \\"Gossip in the Grain.\\"
B001F0VHEM|5.0|I always believe that any artist delivers the best work of their career whenever in a depressing or emotional state of mind. This obvious rule applies to every artist. Not just singers, fashion designers, or actors. For Madonna she delivered in True Blue. For Nick Lachey he delivered after his divorce in \\"What's Left of Me\\". For Mariah Carey it was Butterfly. No truer words have been spoken and the same rule of thumb applies to this situation. Here we have Pink going through her divorce from a guy she was hardly even married to for a year. Kinda figures they were gonna break up from the beginning because when you have 2 people with that many tattoos you know drama is about to ensue.<br /><br />I always loved R&B Pink & i know she will never be that way again. She has completely gone in the realm of Rock. FUNHOUSE is a stand out up because some of her most personal lyrics are on full display. For me the most stand out track would have to be \\"I Don't Believe You\\". Even if you're not going through a divorce you can find something in your life where this song equates to a pivotal situation or moment when you come of age through a traumatic experience. Pink sings this song in such a haunting way you can feel the kid falling from the swing set. That's how amazing her voice sounds. You can hear her breaking down when she sings.<br /><br />Pick up this album up, it's a winner.
B000AMJG4Y|5.0|Final Fantasy VII Advent Children is the best movie ever made by Square Enix I can't tell you how good it is you have to see for your self best hour in a half of your day no questions asked.
B000G8NY4U|5.0|This Live Concert is just Excellent. Yanni introduces advanced technology on doing this presentation at the Mandeley, not only with music but light effects. Many of the songs were performed on prior albums but they are worthy to listen and watch once more. I recommend it.
B000WGWQG8|5.0|Excellant performances.  I'm so glad I purchased this DVD. I have watched it several times.
B0012BUX0I|5.0|An assumed simple story of an ugly incident between 3 players turns out to reflect the very nature of human beings on how truth can be perceived and can be so differently interpreted by the very same people. Kurosowa brings out the irony of reality and how fleeting it can really be.
0064431622|5.0|The kids in my pre k class really enjoyed this story.  Eric Carle is a terrific writer.  They always ask to read it a second time.
B00000J7RZ|5.0|I have wanted this album since it was released; however, in 1999, I was only 12 and had no money to purchase it. But I am so glad to have it now because it is fabulous! Jennifer Lopez has a great voice and the songs on this CD make you feel good, and they are unforgettable. I really enjoy the singles \\"If You Had My Love\\" and \\"Waiting For Tonight\\" because they remind me of my younger days--great times. This is a great album for everyone!
B001CQONKY|5.0|I have been getting DVD's from Amazon for a while now and I am extremely pleased with their service.
0312427646|5.0|This little book is a joy.  Always witty and amusing, often laugh-out-loud funny; Alan Bennett brilliantly captures the controlled upset that ensues within and without Buckingham Palace when the Queen pursues the joy of reading to the detriment of her usual routines.
B001EO2UJK|5.0|All I have to say is that after hearing the album 1,000 times, now hearing The Lamb in Dolby 5.1 surround is like hearing it fresh.  Sounds I never noticed before jump out.  And the DVD has the stage screens displayed while the album plays.  Very cool.
B0013ND30M|5.0|bought it as a gift for daughter-she loved it!  She collects all the old disney movies& this one being re done was all she needed to hear to want it!! We love disney-fav one is Lady & the Tramp
B000002H92|4.0|I Really Liked It !!! It has some rough edges that are a plus if you like live albumns. Bought it instead of Absolutly Live and got that and more without realizing it.
B001CC7PP8|5.0|I have never forgotten this movie from the first time I saw it in a theater.  The shower scene scared me along with a lot of others there.  At the time I had a Ford like Janet Leigh drove in the movie and would not open the trunk for a couple of weeks.  I have it on tape and just had to add the Special Edition to my DVD collection of Hitchcock movies.  It is one of his best.  The fools that thought they could remake this movie were nuts.  Part of what makes the movie so good is that it is in black and white.  Besides no one can out do the master when it comes to mystery and the way he seemed to know the best actors for the roles.  No one was as good at playing a Psycho as Tony Perkins.
B001GQ2TGA|5.0|First of all, let me say that I typically do not enjoy contemporary \\"Christmas\\" or \\"Winter\\" albums on the whole because I often find that the take on many of the classic carols and hymns are poorly arranged and sung. Also, if there ARE new Christmas songs by the artist, they come of sounding contrived. I am a huge Enya fan, so I am biased, but I genuinely found AWC to be probably the best Winter/Christmas-themed album I've heard. To start off with, there are only two traditional hymns--Oiche Chuin (an Irish version of SILENT NIGHT) and O COME O COME EMMANUEL (an older hymn based on Gregorian chant). Both are performed by Enya with exceptional beauty and skill on this album. Although Enya did perform Oiche Chuin years ago, this new version is is a harmony-based version instead of the single vocal line version of the past and (IMO) is better.<br />Many of the original compositions are heavenly. LAST TIME BY MOONLIGHT is a spectacular piece both melodically and lyrically. ONE TOY SOLDIER is very sweet and child-like (again, the harmonies are amazing). One of the big surprises is MY! MY! TIME FLIES, which is a 70's-inspired pop song with clever lyrics and a ripping electric/blues guitar solo. I really love JOURNEY OF THE ANGELS as well (it has a bit of the Lord of the Rings theme, Aniron).<br />There are various reasons to criticize Enya (my biggest criticism has mostly to do with the use of the same instrumentation over and over), but she consistently writes incredibly melodies and her voice is always a pleasure to hear. This album is as good as any of her last 3 albums, and I think most people will love the feeling it creates at Christmas time...the feeling of peace, happiness (and maybe a bit of reminiscence and melancholy).
B0010X745K|4.0|Synopsis: The '07 release `The Mist' unfolds like a Lovecraftian nightmare come alive in a small rural American community.  Cloaked within a dense, inexplicable mist that engulfs the town lurks a collection of phantasmagorical creatures ranging from what appears to be large, mutated dragonflies and spiders to enormous monstrosities that would answer to such diabolical names as Shoggoth, or Cthulhu if this film had been adapted from a H.P. Lovecraft novel. Though no mention of the nefarious Necronomicon is ever mentioned surely some blasphemous occult conjuring must have been going on in that top secret military base located on the outskirts of town that released these other dimensional beings into our world.<br /><br />David Drayton (Thomas Jane) and his young son are trapped inside a supermarket with a group of terrified town residents and unfortunate travelers with a storefront wall of glass serving as their only protection from the mist and the horrors that await outside. Thoughts and emotions run wild within their precarious refuge. Some escape into denial, some fall into religious hysteria and some contemplate suicide. Only a brave few seem willing to face the truth and plan an escape, or die trying.<br /><br />Critique: `The Mist' is an exciting, harrowing film that firmly held my interest from beginning to end. Christopher Lambert look-a-like Thomas Jane delivers a solid performance as the strong and valiant David Drayton who is forced to not only suppress his own personal fear of the incomprehensible menace outside but deal with the mounting emotional onslaught of those around him. I also enjoyed the performance of Laurie Holden as the level-headed but vulnerable Amanda Dumfries and Marcia Gay Harden as the unstable religious zealot Mrs. Camody. On the negative side I wish they hadn't done the too often repeated alien incubation sequence. It was great in `Alien' but enough is enough. The religious fanaticism subplot was also a little over-the-top for my tastes but it certainly wasn't enough to spoil my enjoyment of the central storyline.<br /><br />When all is said and done it's definitely the Lovecraft inspired monsters in the mist that capture my imagination. I keep seeing in my minds eye those final moments of the film as the valiant few drive through the fog and view all the mayhem and destruction wrought by these creatures. The sounds of their unearthly bellowing and glimpses of unimaginable horror as they move in and out of sight within the thick mist are accentuated by the haunting soundtrack provided by Lisa Gerrard. This is truly an unforgettable image that will stay with the viewer for quite some time.ainly wasn't enough to spoil my enjoyment of the central storyline.

B00168OINK|4.0|Awesome picture and audio quality. The central character rose a bit quickly from zero to hero, but you can't deny the appeal of the detail in the animation and the funny one liners. Loved Mantis-one of my favorite characters! The actors and voices were distinct; the characters seemed to stand on their own, unlike some of the other animated films, where it almost seems like the characters are cartoon versions of the actors. Very cool fight scenes and important message that appeals to parents and kids-strength of character is more important than some \\"secret ingredient\\"-a person directs his/her own course. Thoroughly enjoyed this film!
B00005V9HH|5.0|My money was refunded, the seller sent me an email telling me that he felt that the movie was not of good quality and did not feel comfortable sending it.
B0010KHOS0|5.0|This movie holds a special place in my heart, mainly because I and my family are big Johnny and June Cash fans, but for other reasons as well. As you may well know, it is about Johnny Cash's (Joaquin Phoenix) struggle with drugs, fame, and his affair with June Carter (Reese Witherspoon) over the course of his career. You see the performances, you see the drug action, you even get to hear Reese and Joaquin sing some songs (and they're not bad either). This special addition, however, is for those of us that want more Cash action. It is filled with extras on Johnny Cash's career, his music, the production of the film, all the things you DON'T get on the single disc version, as well as scenes that aren't in the original movie itself (this being the director's cut). That being said, this movie is a fantastic love story, filled with twists and turns, that keeps you seated until the credits. You don't want to miss it!
0783226888|5.0|The Jackal, very well made movie full of suspense and drama. I have watched this movie many times over and never get tired of watching it.   I had this movie on VHS format, I have a DVD recorder, but decided I wanted a good quality version so I bought this through Amazon.  To my delight the DVD that I purchased had deleted scenes, an alternate ending and interviews by some of the big name cast, the director talking about making the movie and a lot more.  One of my favorite scenes was seeing Jack Black blown away by Bruce Willis, \\"Thanks Bruce\\" that guy is just plain annoying.  The Cast includes Bruce Willis, Richard Gere, Diane Venora and the Great Sidney Poiter.  Buy it, watch it, you will enjoy it.  Just one persons opinion.
B0000AQS0F|5.0|The series is great. The DVD's themselves and the boxes look suspiciously cheaply printed and made but the series itself is great. The company I bought it from shipped the set poorly and the case was completely bent up and several DVD's had slipped in their cases and were sliding around loose, a few minor scratches didn't hurt it though.

Please, please, please, publishers, yes, there is a market!!!!
B000002UJQ|5.0|I am a new Radiohead fan.  That's right, it is only recently that I took the Radiohead plunge and it all began with their latest album \\"In Rainbows.\\"  After that, I was hooked.  In order to appease my fix I started purchasing all of their albums on Amazon.com.  OK Computer was not a disappointing follow up, but rather a great discovery.  It is a bit darker than \\"In Rainbows,\\" and the industrial sounds mixed with rock riffs and the brilliance of Thom York's lyrics and vocals, OK Computer was the perfect follow up for me.  I recommend it to anyone who believes in higher conscienceness, or, amazing music infiltrated with substance.  I give it 2 VERY enthusiastic thumbs up.
B0000524CY|5.0|It's difficult to look back on a film \\"classic\\" and try to review it through today's eyes...35 years later.  It's always tempting to say, \\"Those effects were great...for 1973\\" or \\"imagine how that affected an audience...three decades ago.\\"  You almost feel like you have to make excuses for the film.    But I am happy to report that in a very recent, pre-Halloween viewing, THE EXORCIST has withstood the test of time nearly unscathed.  Yes, some of the effects (there are actually fewer than you would expect) are not up to the standards of today.  The clothing is often hilariously tacky.  Technology is primitive.    Yet William Friedkin's classically styled direction of William Peter Blatty's effectively unsettling novel still has the uncanny ability to give us the creeps today.  Often (VERY often) imitated, but not yet equaled, THE EXORCIST is simply brilliant.    If you don't know the story:  young Regan (Linda Blair, before she was the punchline to a lot of cheap jokes) lives in a lovely Washington DC home with her recently divorced movie-actress mother (Ellen Burstyn).  They are a well-to-do little family, with a housekeeper, cook & nanny.  But they are presented as a loving pair.    Soon, though, Regan begins to exhibit strange behavior, including rather vivid tales of her talks with \\"imaginary\\" friends she clearly believes are real.  Her mother begins taking her to doctors and specialists, who at first assume it's just adolescence.  Then Regan's behavior starts getting worse, and frankly, a bit hard to explain.  It's when she starts talking in strange voices and levitating from her bed that all rational explanations begin to go out the window.    I describe this, I admit, in a fairly flippant way.  But it does NOT come across as cheesy or ironic or with a wink.  It's played dead straight, and is presented almost like a medical procedural story.  Something you'd see on a much calmer episode of HOUSE.  Rational people, trying to come up with reasonable explanations, until, chillingly, they are all forced to throw up their hands in despair.  And no one is despairing more than Burstyn, who has seen her daughter cursing in a deep voice, levitating herself and her bed, thrashing in violent seizures, with cuts developing on her face.  Regan also, quite disturbingly, abuses herself with a cross.  Yes, that scene has been made fun of MANY times over the years...but seeing it proves that the original has lost none of its impact.  It is a queasy and startling moment.    Meanwhile, some strange things have been doing on in the local Catholic Churches, and priest/psychologist Father Karras (Jason Miller) is trying explain these happenings, while also dealing with guilt over his elderly (soon to be dead) mother AND his loss of faith.  These scenes also have a matter-of-fact, non-exploitative feeling...as though we're watching a \\"normal\\" drama about a religious man floundering in his duties.    Eventually, mother Burstyn turns to Father Karras for help.  She's convinced her daughter needs an exorcism.  Karras, who not only personally doesn't believe in exorcism but also knows the church is HIGHLY skeptical of them too, agrees reluctantly to visit Regan.  He is horrified by what he sees, but for awhile, he searches for rational explanations too.  Yet, eventually, he must turn to \\"legendary\\" Father Merrin (Max Von Sydow), a priest who has actually performed such a ritual.    ALSO, there has been a mysterious death of a friend of Burstyn's and Detective Kinderman (Lee J. Cobb) is investigating, giving the movie the feel of an old-fashioned detective story.    I've rehashed a lot of the plot, first to remind you of its intricacies (but hopefully not spoiling much) but also to emphasize how much this movie is NOT presented as a horror film.  It is shown as anything but, frankly, for much of its running time.  This serves only to make the horror more effective because it seems so incredibly PLAUSIBLE.  When it's all done, we can look back and realize that the basic sketch of the horrible things that happen isn't too original.  It's the CONTEXT in which they play out that works so well.    In many ways, we come to \\"believe\\" Regan is possessed just as Father Karras does.  He's a doubter who is FORCED to believe, because no other explanation will serve.  The movie is a \\"horror-procedural\\" or a \\"demonic detective story.\\"  It is creepy as hell, too!    By the time this stately paced film reaches its final 20 minute or so, we are pretty much wrung out.  Regan's room has become an ice-cold bastion of evil.  The fear and the chill are palpable to the viewer.  And even though I knew the outcome, I was riveted to the film...stunned that I was still able to be creeped out even on my 4th viewing.  The film is constructed so well and with no hint of irony.  It is dead serious.  Friedkin took, frankly, the exactly correct approach to the material, and it paid off.  The script is first-rate, as well.    Best of all, we've got a cast of fantastic actors playing their juicy roles completely seriously.  Ellen Burstyn occasionally drifts to the hammy side towards the end (as she so often does) but only slightly.  Linda Blair is fearsome effective...even with the help of makeup and the voice of Mercedes McCambridge, she is a striking figure.  Lee J. Cobb was a fantastic actor (the original Willy Loman) and has been sadly missed for many years.  His Det. Kinderman is a small role, but he brings a touch to it that gives the film a whiff of humor.  Max Von Sydow is an imposing figure...he's done many, many great performances since...but his work here is what he'll be most remembered for (at least by American audiences).  Finally, Jason Miller is dead perfect as Father Karras, who to me is the true heart-and-soul of this film.  It is HIS personal journey that most gives this film gravitas.  Miller was a very talented actor and writer.  His performance ranks right up there with other greats of that era of the `70s when Method actors like Pacino and deNiro were making their big marks.  I suspect that had he not been so reluctant to do film work,  he could have been one of the greats as well.    By all means, see THE EXORCIST again.  I believe you'll be as pleasantly surprised as me.  And if by some chance you have NOT seen it...do yourself a favor.  There's a reason this film is deemed a classic...and it is not a \\"stuffy old\\" film that doesn't  hold up today.      I saw the DVD that comes with some restored scenes.  Most of the scenes were not needed (a lot more stuff with Father Merrin wandering around the middle east)...but there were a few brief moments with Von Sydow and Burstyn near the end that were quite good...plus a VERY brief but unforgettable shot of Regan coming down some stairs in a very unconventional way.
B0010X73ZG|5.0|When it comes to scary movies, monsters don't do it for me.  Vampires, werewolves, alien beings--they are all entertaining, but not scary.  People terrify me; human fraility scares the crap out of me.  Which is why \\"The Mist\\" has long been one of my favorite King novellas: sure, it's a monster tale, but the REAL monsters in the story aren't the ones out in the mist--they're the ones inside the store.  In some cases they are obvious; in others, not.<br /><br />When I first saw \\"The Mist,\\" I thought it was a good B-movie, with a classic ending (truly one of the best in horror cinema).  I was disturbed more so than usual, but not absolutely floored.  But I thought about it.  And thought about it.  It's been almost a year since I first saw it; I recently watched it a second time (in black and white this time, btw).  And I was terrified.  The special effects are pretty good, though at times they get in the way of the actors.  Let me stress that--the actors, here, are the true stars, not the special effects.  Thomas Jane is phenomenal; Marcia Gay Harden is chilling.  Frank Darabont does a brilliant job of bringing King's tale to the screen (even King himself has stated he wished he'd thought of this ending).<br /><br />The story, for what it's worth, centers around a group of people trapped inside a convenience store.  Outside the plate-glass windows is...the mist.  The mist and the deadly, flesh-eating creatures that lurk in it.  The real story of the movie, the real meat (and the real scary stuff), is what happens to the people trapped inside the store--how they cope with it, to who and what they turn to for comfort.  This is a film that tackles the topic of what would happen when ordinary citizens encounter something truly alien--not something we're halfway familiar with, but something completely outside our capabilities for rationalization.  What WOULD happen if strange beings appeared from practically nowhere and began eating your loved ones?  How would that affect the human psyche?<br /><br />That's what King's tale tried to explain; Darabont's film follows suit.  It is a haunting, subtle film that will stay with you long after it's over, thanks in part to (what I consider to be, at least) one of the greatest horror movie endings ever.  You should also, if given the chance (which thank God you are, on the two-disc edition), watch the film in black & white.  The effects come off as a little cheesier...but that's half the fun.  Because, with a film this dark and disturbing, we'll take the fun wherever we can find it.That's what King's tale tried to explain; Darabont's film follows suit.

B001GKJ2F2|5.0|I found this to be quite possibly my favorite film of the summer, if not the whole year. While it's obvious that this is meant to be an action film, I found it to have hidden depths and messages that give it the needed umph to surprise it's viewers. It's humor also saved the film. You will come out of this movie feeling motivated and empowered to do something extraordinary with your own life.<br /><br />You find yourself relating to the main character, and chearing him on when he learns to stand up for himself. It's hidden depth comes from the fact that Wesley Gibson(McAvoy) is a man searching for who he really is, his identity, and at the same time searching to understand the man his father was. Most of us can relate to the character's struggles.<br /><br />I love the humor in the midst of all the action, relieving tension, and helping you relate to the band of misfits, who've taken it upon themselves to look after the greater good of mankind.<br /><br />If you don't take the film too seriously, and realize that it is purely (great) fiction, you will come out of this experience having enjoyed yourself immensely. I can't wait!

B001KPK6Q2|5.0|This an awesome album, Fearless was perfect for the first track. Breathe is cool driving song. Makes you want to start new.     Shes beautiful and blessed with a gift. God Bless Taylor Swift...and all of you.    Enjoy the album. She's amazing and this album really shows shes growing in her music.
B001EYGOEM|5.0|Taylor Swift is one talented teen! She had a hand again in every song on her highly anticipated sophomore CD - this time she wrote 7, and co-wrote 6. The first single, \\"Love Story\\" is a good example of how she can combine great lyrics with a catchy beat - and then produce a smash crossover hit. The most remarkable thing about the album is that it is incredibly balanced...and almost every song is so good that it could be released as a radio single. I think it is now safe to say that she is a rising star who will just keep on rising!<br /><br />Taylor opens the album with the strong title track \\"Fearless\\", and ends the album with the powerful theme song of the summer Olympics, \\"Change\\". In the middle is a catchy song that she wrote with John Rich - \\"The Way I Loved You\\" - and an epic tune which is sure to be a smash hit - \\"You Belong With Me\\". \\"Fifteen\\" is her most personal song, a bittersweet gem where she sings about her freshman year and her best friend for the past 5 years, Abigail. \\"White Horse\\" (which has already been featured on Grey's Anatomy) is a well written tearjerker - a heartfelt song that is just waiting to become her next big single. A good example of her more acoustic side is \\"Breathe\\" - a simple song written with Colbie Caillat who also sings background vocals in the song. Taylor's writing seems to have matured and grown in the past 2 years. Take \\"The Best Day\\" for example - which is a completely different but awesome song, which is written about her family. She appeals to a wide audience, and executes this so well here on Fearless.<br /><br />It's incredible how quickly Taylor crossed over and became not only a big country star, but a huge pop star also. It took only her second single - Teardrops On My Guitar - for her to become amazingly popular in mainstream music! Then she continued to release 3 more hits (two of them #1) off her debut album. Talk about a hard act to follow - but I can't see this trend stopping anytime soon with Fearless - this album is a major home run. She isn't the same country artist who sang \\"Tim Mcgraw\\", and I understand that some people will not be happy about that. If there are any flaws here, it would be that many of the songs are pop-country hits which are about the same subject - teens. You can't please everyone, but look for her to just become even bigger and more popular, with more #1's and crossover pop smash hits. Taylor's sophomore CD is very well done...filled with excellent, self-penned, radio-friendly top 40 hits! Overall ~ 9/10 ~lbum is a major home run.

B0001L3LUE|3.0|McNamara is clearly spinning history and running from his ghosts. I once read that he was known for simply making up any 'facts' he needed.    His comment in the film that \\"None  of our allies supported us (in Vietnam)\\" would come as a surprise to South Korea,Thailand,Australia,New Zealand and the Philippines - all of whom had troops in Vietnam.    He claims to have opposed the consensus of military leaders to bomb Cuba during the missile crisis, but then goes along with them for their recommendations of the conduct of the Vietnam war - saying later that he should have spoken up. This is a man who wants to have it both ways - and always be on the right side in the judgment of history - or so he thinks.    His reflections on the bombing of Japan are also somewhat curious. He neglects to mention that the Japanese civilians were warned by the US Air Force to evacuate 26 cities - but their leadership cynically dispersed the wartime industries into the residential areas and kept the civilians there. The Japanese government was to blame for what happened to their civilians - just as they were to blame for war crimes committed by Japanese troops. Taking events out of historical context - as McNamara frequently does - is the mark of someone who is trying to explain away actions at the time in order to conform to current political correctness.    The documentary is technically excellent - but having other voices to contradict McNamara on his many self-serving statements would have added more context and additional depth to the work. But that is solely (and correctly) the editorial judgment of the filmmaker.    All in all - an interesting soliloquy from McNamara, who was a participant in many of the events that have shaped our times.

0385340990|4.0|The year is 1946.  The setting is the British Isles.  Europe is beginning to recover from World War II.  Juliet Ashton, a young London writer, is looking for a subject for her next book.  She falls into a chance correspondence with Dawsey Adams, a farmer on Guernsey, a British island occupied by the Germans during the war.  Through Dawsey, she learns of a wartime literary society on Guernsey, formed hastily by a dozen or so island neighbors as an alibi for breaking curfew.  And through her ensuing correspondence with various members of the society, she learns how they grew fond of literature and of each other, and how they came to care for a four-year-old girl whose parents are missing.  Juliet is drawn to the island and its literary society, initially as a possible subject for her writing, but ultimately because of her affection for the plain, sometimes eccentric, good folk she meets there.<br /><br />The story is told almost entirely through letters, first between Juliet and her Guernsey correspondents, then, after she goes to live on the island for the summer, between Juliet and her publisher and her best friend back in England.  It is an enjoyable and engrossing read.  My only (minor) criticism is that a couple of characters seemed so deliberately caricatured that they yanked me right out of the story and into the presence of the author's apparent biases.  Nevertheless, this story will appeal to lovers of historical fiction, lovers of literature, and lovers of the art of writing, including the disappearing art of letter writing.

B001F290E4|4.0|On his sixth studio album, UK singer Seal follows up his brilliant but under-performing dance album \\"System\\" with \\"Soul\\". The album name is inspired by the fact that it comprises covers of 12 Soul classics.<br /><br />Produced by David Foster, it contains classics like Sam Cooke's \\"A change is gonna come\\", a lightly stomping version of Ann Peebles' \\"I can't stand the rain\\" (though Tina Turner's is still my favourite version), James Brown's \\"It's a man's man's world\\", Ben E. King's \\"Stand by me\\", a sombre reading of Harold Melvin & The Bluenotes' \\"If you don't know me by now\\", and Deniece Williams' breezy almost Jazzy \\"Free\\", to mention a few.<br /><br />My favourites though are the Marvin Gaye-sounding \\"I'm still in love with you\\", and the closing cut \\"People get ready\\" with a gospel-style chorus adding to the fervor of the track. Seal's raspy voice is perfectly suited to these classics even if its never used to soaring effect (like on his \\"Kiss from a rose\\").<br /><br />The song arrangements largely stay true to the originals (with minor tweaks here and there) and I'm sure this will appeal to some fans as well as those unfamiliar with the originals. Hopefully, this CD will introduce these classics to a new generation of music lovers.

Take from the working class and give to the people who haven't earned a dime. How is it considered the american dream? What ever happend to working hard, saving money and lower taxes? Since when can we refuse to work and demand perferd treatment? If we lose sight of our consitution and our rights,that is when men like Barack Obama can write junk and be considerd \\"enlightened\\". You can't take freedom from someone who actually knows the constitution. For those who assume this is racism- shame on you!

But, it was mainly back to the guitar for Eddie Van Halen in this endeavor which makes this one of the best albums produced by the band in the Hagar era.

B0013ND30M|5.0|This is the movie that started me off on a lifetime passion for fantasy tales.  I was in third grade when Disney released this film.  Our school had a good citizenship program where once a month we would be allowed to go with some teachers to the local theater for a matinee.  Usually, they were old black and whites starring talking mules and Our Gang cartoons.  The matinees never quite held the same thrill as that day we were treated to a tale of magical kingdoms with fairies and witches where good conquered evil.  I was instantly hooked and spent hours in the library searching for volumes of fairy tale books.  When my daughter was born, I began collecting Disney videos and now I am starting a new collection of DVDs for my granddaughter.  I hope that she will find them as exciting as I did.  It is much harder to instill that magical experience now when the market is flooded with cheap imitations starring Barbie and smart mouthed zebras.  It says much about the quality of the old Disney films in that they are still able to hold a young child spellbound after 50 years.

0151013837|5.0|By Alex Schnepf                                Life of Pi is well worth the money it costs to purchase this book.  This book has amazing descriptions of gruesome yet mind-numbing animal fights and also it uses great descriptors when talking about Pi's emotional feelings, physical and inner conflicts.              This riveting adventure for this young, Indian, vegetarian boy, Pi, is told in first person. For the most part in this story, Pi is drifting out on the Pacific Ocean with a couple of visitors aboard his vessel (a good size life boat). Those visitors are a zebra, a hyena, an orangutan, and a bloodthirsty Bengal tiger.              Another thing that brought this book to life were the impeccable illustrations done by Tomaslav Torjanac.  They added a great graphic picture to already amazing descriptions by Yann Martel.              All in all, I thought this book was very well written with outstanding descriptions and a real perspective on moral values and life.
B001E7OO2I|3.0|I gave John Legend a big shot with his debut album and actually liked its somewhat spotty but varied sound. Then i heard \\"heaven\\" from his second CD and \\"PDA\\" and was like okay, cool cool. Then it took me a good two or three months to give \\"Green light\\" an actual green light. I was at Best Buy a few weeks ago and they had his live DVD playing on one of the big screens and he actually does pretty good on live shows and I decided to pick up this CD since it was on sale and I couldn't find \\"The Arrival\\" by Kindred the Family Soul. I gave the CD a few listens and i got either a headache or real sleepy halfway through. What looked promising sounded deriative at best. his duet with Brandy was way less than I expected, the CD ran together and at the end of the week, after importing into iTunes, i just picked and choosed what to listen to and even after a few more days, i don't even listen to it and the CD has collected dust pretty much. I don't know where John is going with his but he needs to return back to the ol' word of relatable R&B and stop trying to channel Johnny Mathis and channel more Donny Hathaway.
0307387178|5.0|I'm saddened to see so many people writing with little or no compassion for Chris McCandless, and such a limited effort to understand his quest.     Most of us know what he was running from -- problems at home, a society struggling with issues of materialism and morality. But an understanding of what he was searching for -- inner peace, closeness with nature, a quiet and beautiful place in which to think -- eludes many of us, just as it eluded him.    It could be lovely, could it not? Wild strawberries spilling down the riverbank, red poppies flaming the hills, cobalt mountains loping along the sky, like waves in a gently rolling sea. I am blessed to live in such a place, where I can reflect and write in perfect solitude, and I appreciate the beautiful life I have. I live a little like he did, but without his extraordinary deprivation -- the berries, the bag of rice, no way (as he perceived it at that time) to get out.    Jon Krakauer mined this tragedy for the beauty, the goodness, and the hope that could be found in it -- and this bounty was rich! -- and I applaud his book and his wonderful writing, as I applaud the deeply moving film Sean Penn waited so patiently, for ten years, to create.    I agree with some of the points other reviewers have made -- that the particular venture Chris McCandless chose was ill-advised, that he had not adequately prepared for it, and that his family need not have been abandoned and left in the dark.     But we have all screwed up in our lives and hurt people around us, at least once, have we not? Well, I certainly have.    When other people use poor judgment and make mistakes, it's so easy to judge, to criticize, to close our minds. That's the easy way out, isn't it?    Whether we see Chris McCandless as a crazy kid, or as a courageous and intensely spiritual young man, we do know that he died afraid and alone. For that reason, if for no other, I think we need to reach for all the understanding and compassion we can give.Arlene Sanders  Blue Ridge Mountains, Virginia  [...]
B000FSME1A|5.0|I was pleased with my purchase of the two-disc special collectors edition.  Still great after all these years.
B00006GEXQ|5.0|The concept is simple. An avaricious male pretends that he has a son in order to meet women and yet ends up becoming a parental figure for a young boy. Although this is \\"About a Boy\\" in a nutshell, the Weitz brothers' motion picture deals with the sobering topics of suicide and single parenting while infusing comedy to highlight the importance of relationships. This Oscar nominated film is a piece of entertainment that provides an interesting perspective on the realities of life.            Hugh Grant stars as the shallow Will Lightman in the film adaptation of Nick Hornby's novel About a Boy. An aging London bachelor, Will prides himself on being free of all commitments and believes that all men are islands. Never having worked a day in his life, Will lives comfortably off the royalties of his father's one hit wonder, \\"Santa's Super Sleigh.\\" Self-indulgences like playing pool, watching television, and taking a bath fill up the units of his day. Newcomer Nicholas Hoult delivers a breakout performance as the 12-year-old outsider Marcus who is frequently bullied and does not have any true friends. Marcus is willing to do anything to make his depression prone mother Fiona smile; even commit social suicide. Wearing mustard-colored corduroy pants and a rainbow sweater, Marcus sings \\"Killing Me Softly,\\" Fiona's favorite song, during a school talent show. Engrossed in her own problems, Fiona is clueless about her only son's misery.            The plot is set in motion when Will creates a fictional son named Ned in order to attend SPAT (Single Parents Alone Together) meetings and meet women. The SPAT mothers are the epitome of what Will has been searching for- thirsty for passion, but unready to commit to a relationship again. While dating one of the members, Will meets Marcus at a SPAT picnic. Upon arrival home, Marcus finds Fiona unconscious on the floor after a suicide attempt. She is revived and returns to normal life, but Marcus is never certain that she will still be there by the end of the day. Convinced by Fiona's instability that he needs another parental figure, Marcus sets his mother and Will up on a date, which fails miserably. Despite this, Marcus follows Will and manipulates the bachelor into spending time with him by threatening to expose the secret of Will's invention of Ned. Convinced that caring for another person is the last thing that he wants to do, Will realizes, over the course of the film, that Marcus is the only facet in his life of true value.            American brothers Chris and Paul Weitz managed to produce a heartfelt creation in the course of their third directorial venture. Before \\"About a Boy,\\" the Weitz brothers had only previously directed the poorly reviewed \\"American Pie\\" and \\"Down to Earth.\\" The brothers decided to experiment with the camera to incorporate more artistic shots than they had in their previous spineless works. As Marcus walks towards the camera during one of the scenes, the air is thick and distorted much like the air above a fire. The effect was accomplished by placing a burner underneath the lens and results in making this child appear threatening. Another interesting shot is when Will is shown walking in the opposite direction of everyone else like a fish swimming upstream. His avoidance of all responsibility and rejection of forming relationships makes him unlike the rest of humanity. The use of different color palettes helps the audience to better understand the characters. Will is associated with cool colors like blue and gray. His apartment is sleek and modern but also comes across as being unfriendly and absent of life because it is comprised of these muted tones. Marcus' house incorporates vibrant shades of color giving it a more cluttered and bohemian feel. Filled with material items, Will's flat reflects his shallowness. By the end of the film, the focus shifts from these objects to the people he has formed relationships with as they all gather in his home for Christmas. Novice directors Paul and Chris Weitz managed to fashion Hornby's novel into a genuinely meaningful and heartfelt film.            At the directors' request, Damon Gough, who is better known as the mastermind behind Badly Drawn Boy, agreed to score \\"About a Boy.\\" Scoring this film was an interesting career move for Gough because he had just previously won the United Kingdom's coveted Mercury Prize for his first full-length album, The Hour of Bewilderbeast. The majority of recording artists generally record a follow-up album after their debut, but Damon Gough went in a completely different direction and tried his hands at scoring by writing original music for the Weitz brothers' film instead. Best described as folk-rock music, Badly Drawn Boy's melodic soundtrack harmonizes perfectly with the motion picture. \\"A Minor Incident\\" is heard when Marcus returns from the hospital and finds Fiona's suicide note addressed to him. This is the most moving and harrowing song in the movie because the lyrics function as the letter being read aloud. Damon Gough's music compliments the emotions of the scenes while still managing to stand on its own as a beautiful work of art.            I would highly recommend this film to anyone. Hugh Grant strays from his quintessential role as the charming love interest and is portrayed as a greedy and withdrawn jerk in this movie. His character does not have any relationships because he believes that if people can make you feel better, then they can also hurt you. Marcus shows Will that the risk is worth taking because human connections are what make life worth living.  By the end of the film, Will has finally matured emotionally and realizes the eternal truth that no man is an island. A great movie with a positive message, \\"About a Boy\\" reminds us that authentic affluence is found in relationships.

0743298039|4.0|Unsettling and gothic in its mood, and disturbingly eerie in its setting, Setterfield's The Thirteenth Tale is a homage to the classic gothic Victorian novel. The author establishes a strange atmosphere, one that gets under your skin. One gets the sense that all is not right in Angelfield household, and that there is some startling or bizarre twist that is going to come out and shock or disturb the reader.          The novel is a ghost story in a sense, as each of the main two characters, Margaret Lea and Vida Winter, have untold pasts that come to haunt each in its own way. There are apparitions that seemingly cross Margaret's eyes, but then there are painful memories from the past that, when revealed, are more haunting. When Miss Lea, a biographer, goes to Vida Winter's residence with the opportunity of learning the renown author's life story, she not only opens up the door to the secrets of Winter's life, but her own.          One enjoyable aspect of Setterfield's work is the mysteriousness that rings forth. The author does enough to hold the reader in suspense all the while giving some insight into the background of the Angelfield household. The ominous appearance of Miss Winter's house is depicted early on: \\"Barred shutters blacked out the windows and there was not a single sign of human habitation. Closed in upon itself, the place seemed to shun visitors\\" (37). Miss Winter's failing health seems to add to the dreariness of the setting, and she slowly divulges the bizarre family secrets of Charlie, Isabelle, George Angelfield, Hester, Dr. Maudsley, and the mysterious twins, Adeline and Emmeline. Before everything is over, there will be a fire that sets in motion much tragedy for Miss Winter's family, and mistaken identities will be revealed. The author does enough to keep the wheels in motion, giving you little glimpses here and there so you can try to figure out what will happen next.          While I enjoyed the effort at creating mystery and mood, the overabundance of dysfunction was less-than-appealing. Between insane asylums, incest, murder, deadly fires, affairs, the book goes from Gothic to downright morbid at times. The shocking moments were attempts at furthering the plot and characterization, but come across as a means of gaining cheap \\"shock value\\", tabloid-type popularity.          However, the one hiccup doesn't detract from the over all impact of the book. It is a great novel to read on a cold, winter's night when you are thinking about curling up with a good mystery. I don't think it is quite five star material, but the next best thing.

159102594X|1.0|This book has one of the most stupid sentence I have read in a book . Jezal say in page 68 \\"he couldn't afford to be seen walking.. with a fat girl on his arm. I't could ruin his reputation\\".      As a fat girl I thanks mister Abercrombie ,because I not going to buy the other two books , perhaps if a fat girl like me read his books could ruin his reputation .
0316143472|5.0|I am familiar with several David Sedaris' works and I enjoy his occasional New York column.  Most of which are extremely enjoyable to read (I didn't care for Barrel Fever).  This book contains many short stories from David's life, written in a very relatable and humorous manner.  David's works are some of the easiest reads I've ever encountered, and his candor is really disarming.  Reading his stories makes me feel like I know his family personally, and the writing all the more endearing because of it.<br /><br />Anybody who has ever thought their family was strange should read this book.  People who can appreciate the minor quirks in ourselves and others will appreciate this book.  Folks who enjoy a series of funny stories that will have you eagerly flipping the pages as you cackle with delight should buy this book.

0307269752|5.0|Whenever a book (or movie or television program or cd or anything) gets too much buzz, I tend to be hyper critical and not really fully enjoy it. Maybe I'm negative; maybe it's human nature. But I went from dying to read The Girl With The Dragon Tattoo, after reading about it in Vanity Fair, to feeling a sense of uh-oh...everyone is talking about this book way, way too much.<br /><br />So I was pleasantly surprised that I was able to lose myself in this novel and get fully involved in it. I was also surprised that not only were the characters and the plot fantastic, but I also was really engaged by the setting in a European country where I've never been and frankly know little about.<br /><br />This book had a distinct flavor and yet remained highly readable. The tension was reminiscent of Silence of the Lambs, and I was completely hooked and entertained through to the last pages. Many times, mysteries and thrillers don't know how to resolve themselves, but this book was fully realized.<br /><br />I'm glad there will be two more books by Steig Larsson and sad that he died too young.
B001H5X7KC|5.0|I went and saw this movie in theaters and loved it. It is not for younger kids but for everyone else it is a riot. Downey Jr. does an amazing job in his role. For me Jack Black was one of the best if not the best in this movie playing a heroin addicted actor. To wrap it all up you have Tom Cruise playing a crazy guy.    This is one of the best comedies that I have saw in a long time and I mean the best. I look forward to adding this to my collection the day it comes out and checking out what Unrated parts are added.

B000002HNR|4.0|A long time ago, my friends and I took some acid. It was in the dead of winter, sub-zero temperatures. We were in someone's basement, the air thick with incense and marijuana smoke, black light posters ripping colors through the darkness. Then someone put on \\"Celebration of the Lizard\\" from Absolutely Live. It was the first time I ever heard it.<br /><br />Hearing that \\"song\\" in a room where florescent colors are the only illumination and with a head full of purple haze and Columbian gold was an experience I would not soon forget.<br /><br />Afterward, we walked through the freezing winds and icy ground to the lake. The details of what followed are unimportant; except that we dove headfirst into a misadventure that almost cost us our lives; that spooky, surrealist music and poetry still reverberating through our heads like the voice of a mad spirit. Driving us forward and inspiring us to face death at the hands of the merciless elements. Challenging us to survive.<br /><br />New band claim to be rebellious; yet are little more than petulant children who insist upon poisoning themselves with drugs and alcohol; with no talent or depth of vision to back up their rebellious nature. And certainly Morrison and the boys did plenty of drugs and booze. But while most rock groups play rebel, the Doors were truly dangerous in that they used a unique musical form and poetic incantation inspired by Blake and Nietzsche to deftly manipulate the primal essence of the human psyche. Ask yourself how many can be considered true threats to social order? How many can offer an experience of real adventure, danger; an initiation ritual from which one emerges transformed?<br /><br />This is what's missing in much of today's music.

031606792X|5.0|Ok, so I looove the twilight series. I like the stile of writing, the story, characters and so on. I loved Stephanie Meyer until \\"The Host\\", one of the worst books I have ever read. So when the new Twilight book arrived and after the not so good reviews I was very hesitant to read it. Didn't want to ruin my good opinion of the series.  What a relief - this book is simply great. The pace is fast, the story amazing and the whole new direction is just perfect for the series. Great and very entertaining story. Thank you Stephanie Meyer:))
0061205699|5.0|OK, everyone under the sun has reviewed To Kill A Mockingbird; why do I feel like reviewing it?<br /><br />I just re-read this after reading it once when I was in middle school, many moons ago (I'm in my 40s).  I could not put this book down.  What a superb and satisfying novel.  It's amazing how compelling and universal a tale that Lee spun with just a pretty simple, basic, and down-to-earth set of small town characters.  As noted, I read this when I was in middle school and I remember enjoying it more than almost any other assigned book I had read.  I'm amazed at how great it is, from the perspective of a mature adult with diverse life experiences, much travel, and my own children.  This edition is a nicely turned-out hardback that I borrowed from my Mom.  A nice edition to hold and read.  No typos; just a very few, very minor printing flaws.<br /><br />This novel richly deserves the acclaim, good reviews, and the Pulitzer it won.  I've enjoyed VERY MUCH every Pulitzer Prize winner I've read, both fiction and non-fiction.  They don't give those prizes out for nothing!<br /><br />Highly recommended.  Enjoy.
B0000C6E4D|5.0|Was extremely satisfied with product and the manner in which delivery was handled.  Always satisfied with Amazon.

0765316897|4.0|While The Hero of Ages lacks some of the strong character performances of Mistborn and The Well of Ascension, author Brandon Sanderson redeems the novel with an operatic finale worthy of the series. The novel's strength is the meticulous plot; Sanderson clearly and carefully structured the scope and storyline of the three novels well before he wrote a single word of Mistborn. The plot twists impress me the most. Not only are they shocking, they are supported by the precision of Sanderson's text. This is what I like most about Sanderson: He is as concerned with HOW he writes as much as with WHAT he writes.     I am a little dissatisfied with the good versus evil storyline. Although Sanderson (through his characters) insists that the story is not \\"good versus evil,\\" it feels like it is, namely because Ruin is written as a villain. Much of what he says makes sense, however because he is unsympathetic, it is difficult to identify with him.     Overall, the joy of Sanderson's series has been experiencing and solving the puzzles of the Final Empire. He populates his world with original, mysterious creations--Allomancy, koloss, kandra, etc.--and in The Hero of Ages he ties everything together. The various themes--the importance of religion, the dichotomy of life and death, the grim realities of leadership--also show Sanderson to be a writer of substance and not just style. I eagerly await his next novel, even if it is the end of Robert Jordan's plodding Wheel of Time series.
038533348X|5.0|This is a great introductory book for those who want to try science fiction but don't want to get too deeply into robots and alien visitations. It's just a great yarn, like any classic novel: a story that will hold your interest because it's more fun than your life.
B00005JPS8|5.0|Loved this movie - catch the clever dialogue and the visuals are just wonderful - Robert Downey Jr. was absolutely perfect for this role.
B001ED7C58|4.0|After reading a few of the reviews, sounds like there will be another soundtrack CD coming out after the movie's release.  Looking forward to that.  I'm liking the tracks on this one, and I'm a coming-up-on-60 Gramma.  My grandson is taking bass and lead guitar lessons, and I really loved introducing him to Supermassive Black Hole, my favorite.  He was impressed that I knew who Muse was.  Most of the tracks create tension, which is excellent, but Stephenie made it clear that 'Bella's Lullaby' was something that Edward hummed for Bella in her room as she was going to sleep before really fleshing it out on his piano at the Cullen mansion.  Gotta say that, as a vocalist, this composition is COMPLETELY \\"unhummable\\"!! And not particularly romantic, either.  Now I just have to get to a matinee while the kids are all still in school so I can get a seat to see the movie and which scenes the different tracks are used in.
B001F290E4|2.0|The problem here is David Foster and Seal are not a good mix. This could have been another Michael McDonald covers album. Lackluster and adds nothing new to the songs.
B001GM0GNC|4.0|and I would have just transfered it to cd anyway. I already like the fact that it is in a widescreen release. The 4 stars is for the packaging however 5 stars for the single sided discs. I also do not like double sided discs. I will be back in a couple days to review disk material after I see and hear it.   Ok 11/24/2008 and I finally pulled the first DVD from the case. As with the next reviewer finding the 109 minute concert to be on the first dvd - excellent, and the concert itself? Excellent. The second dvd was actually good, I say that as I am a music guy myself, still I found the main bonus feature to be watchable. This from a SAS person. The photo galleries were great with well chosen background music. If you like the Police, if you like concerts but not the crowds, this DVD is for you. Well, onto the cds. I don't expect any negative findings but will report back.

B001H5X7JS|5.0|\\"Tropic Thunder\\" comes out guns blazing.  Explosions, gunfire, helicopters crashing...seems like another war movie.  That is until you realize that what you are actually watching, is a parody of \\"Platoon\\".  The concept behind \\"Tropic Thunder\\" is interesting and refreshingly original.    Three big name actors and a rapper are in the process of filming \\"Tropic Thunder\\", the real life account of a Vietnam Vet by the name of Four Leaf Tayback (Nick Nolte).  The cast for said movie includes the fart-happy comedian/drug addict Jeff Portnoy (Jack Black), the washed up action star Tugg Speedman (Ben Stiller), the multi talented, multi award winner Kirk Lazarus (Robert Downey Jr.) and the every other word is an expletive rapper Alpa Chino (Brandon T. Jackson).    When their director (Steve Coogan) feels he is dealing with a bunch of prima donnas, a crazy idea is thought up.  Let's drop these actors in a real war zone and film their movie \\"guerilla style.\\"  The actors are then forced to become the soldiers they are portraying and battle real life guerilla soldiers.    \\"Tropic Thunder\\" is straight up, hardcore R-rated comedy.  Will it offend people?  Probably.  But, be objective and you'll laugh hysterically.  There are many funny moments in \\"Tropic Thunder\\" and the performances alone make the film worth watching, especially Downey's.  It's a big budget action/war/comedy that was pulled off extremely well.  If you want some, I highly recommend you go get some.

0143038419|5.0|I've been reading books for a (relatively!)long time and few have affected me as warmly and deeply as this one. Liz Gilbert is so brutally honest about her personal journey through time and space and spiritual reality, it's hard to imagine that not every single reader would not fall madly in love with this amazing piece of literature.     For one thing, Gilbert isn't even a tiny bit shy about revealing her many personal weaknesses and challenges -- and in so doing, effectively inspires ordinary folk into attempting the extraordinary. Not that these are be-all, end-all pursuits for all of us, but before reading this much-celebrated memoir, I never seriously considered visiting India or meditating.     Loved the vibrant, humorous and candid descriptions of the entertaining characters who populated Gilbert's colorful travels through Italy, India and Bali almost as much as her resonating observations about beautiful/imperfect human nature. And all in laymen's terms, too. Come on! When was the last time most of us read something about '\\"evil\\" being the ego's trick to see ourselves as separate beings' and really 'got it'? (speaking for myself, never!)       Those who knock Eat, Love, Pray for being self-indulgent or superficial, must be confusing it with some other book.     Certainly not for everybody, but if you enjoy personal and honest examinations about the pursuit of self and spiritual wholeness, this book's definitely worth checking out.

B001EO2UJK|5.0|This was the box I was most waiting for. My love affair with Genesis started with P.G's incarnation , and although I own (and truly treasure) the other two boxes ; this is the one I have been waiting for!!!    Phenomenal reproductions ! The 5.1 mixes are astonishing , and even just the stereo remixes pleasure the listener with sounds never heard before. And these are recordings I have heard at least 100's of times over the last 35 + years !    The DVD extras are nice. they round out the collection well. But in the grand scheme of things , early PG Genesis was about the musical imagery happening in your mind. For that alone , this box set offers and delivers it all!    Here's hoping Rhino puts out one more with all the Genesis Live discs. \\"Live\\" , \\"Seconds Out\\" , \\"Three Sides Live\\" , \\"The Shorts\\" , and \\"The Longs\\" could all benefit from an upgrade . And what lurks in the vaults from these live releases?????? Maybe time will tell    For now :  Brush back your hair ; I want to get to know your flesh !
1572816112|5.0|I have over 50 Tarot decks and this is the best symbology I have yet to see.  I especially love the Death card with the pregnant mother and her having to exert some gentle force with her foot on the previous child to remind him that going back into the womb is not a possibility.  It really gets to the nature of the Death card being permanent, can't go back, can only go forward change - change with or without our initiation.  I love how most of the characters have more than one layer to their face - it invites you to ask, \\"How deep do you want to go?\\".  The Lunatic Spread is great for getting to the meat of a matter and is an added bonus.  The LWB is adequate but the real prize is the thought provoking scenarios on each of the cards.  Well done!!!!!!

B001GQ2TGA|5.0|I am so happy that Enya put this album out, especially this year when times are so hard. It is beautifully done in that it has both a typical relaxing \\"Enya\\" spa like quality, and then she has added some fun twists to a few other songs for a bit of uplift. This album is great for Christmas, and can be listened to right on into January and February. I like how some artists are doing \\"winter\\" themes this year, so that you can listen to them even if your not Christian. You will not be disappointed in this lovely album.

B001GKJ2DO|5.0|Mamma Mia is, to me, the ultimate feel good movie of the year. I saw it three times this summer, and every time I loved it a little more. The critics seem to have forgotten that this is, in fact, supposed to be a musical. Musicals are NOT meant to be like \\"regular\\" movies.    Meryl Streep's performance was outstanding, hilarious, sweet, fun... and her voice rocks! Pierce Brosnan may not make a career as a singer, but he was wonderful, just as my very favorite actor Colin Firth. But really I loved all the actors and their performances... and Mamma Mia is on my wish list for christmas. ;)
B001EN71CW|4.0|I love this show. Joss Whedon hit a major home run and Fox was too blind to see that they had a hit in the making... at least with fans of science fiction and maybe, had they been a little patient, even more.<br /><br />That said, the lack of the fifth star in my rating is due to cheap packaging. I had previously bought the DVD set as I didn't know if there would be a blu-ray version (still waiting for Torchwood season 2 on blu-ray) and it is quite nice. It's a box set. Each disc has it's own sleeve with a different character on its cover and the all of these are in a box. However the blu-ray is cheap by comparison. A single standard plastic case with all of the discs sandwiched into it.<br /><br />It appears to me that Fox responded to the demand for a blu-ray version of this but only gave as much as it absolutely had to. I do hope the one reviewer is wrong and that the picture quality is better than the DVD set.
0763639184|5.0|My 2-year-old son loves this book. He counts with it, does color recognition and pattern reccognition (spots, stripes, etc.), and the part I especially like--he gives kisses on cue when we come to that page. The illustrations are bright, bold, and charming, and the text is simple enough for him to memorize (aided by the rhyming, of course). I highly recommend it.

0743454537|4.0|The book my Sisters Keeper by Jodie Picolt, is going absolutely going great. There's a girl named Anna and she has everything until one day her parents try to take it away from her Anna older sister has a deadly disease called leukemia and it's basically attacking her kidney which makes me very sad that this had to happen to her in this way. So now they look at Anna for a kidney transplant knowing  that her parents to have child just to protect another that's very stupid and wrong for them to do that. Now that    Anna knows that she being used hat made her upset and not up to deal with the sugery.  She finally had enough strength to get up and get a lawyer to protect herself she said that how      Her parents were using her to get her body parts just for her sister. And I don't believe that's right .I believe that the parents should've had loved their child. Anna parents could've at least made their daughter feel welcome in the family. My suggestion to the author would be why did they make the parents treat Anna like that? Why her Sister did couldn't find somebody else to give her a kidney transplant? I get really annoyed with most of the characters like Anna's parents; they get on my nerves because to me having Anna was a waste of sperm. The parents deserve to go prison for what they have done.     Annas has a great soul and she deserves to live more than anybody and to me I think her parents are being selfish and inconsiderate towards their own daughter I think that Anna should live with a more comfortable family. Anna sister is not feeling well but that doesn't mean that her parents should use Anna sister for her own body parts. I think that it's her organs and she doesn't have to give them up if she doesn't want to.     There's another problem that I have with this book is when poor Anna took her parents to court for them using her just to protect her sister. I believe that she had every right to take her parents to court because that wasn't right I thinkthe parents should accept what's going to happen to their daughter. And they shouldn't take it out on an innocent little girl who honestly deserves to live too.
0375408282|5.0|Bernhard Schlink's THE READER is written so simply and perfectly, that any one of any age, gender, ethnicity, or other can enjoy this book. In order not to spoil a thing, all I will say is that the story surrounds the relationship that forms between a teenage boy and an older woman in mid-20th century Germany. Later in life, when they are brought back together in unlikely circumstances, Schlink examines not only their history, but the very recent history of Nazi Germany in a trial that is difficult to forget.     While I have not read the original German, the translation by Carol Brown Janeway is exquisite. The writing is so simple, and yet the way in which Schlink describes emotion and relationships makes the character's turmoil so complicated. The conclusion of the book is very well done, whether you find it inconclusive or not. The point is not to wrap up every emotional detail into a nice little bow, but instead to leave you with a proper finish, thinking about the 200+ pages you have just (speedily) read.     It is a very quick read that you will not forget due to the depth that somehow arises from such simple words. It pulls at your heartstrings to know the lengths these characters will go to protect themselves. And now that it is being made into a movie, I am certain that the excitement surrounding this book is only bound to increase. As in every case, read this book before you see the movie! I am certain it is going to be very well done, with Kate Winslet and Ralph Fiennes, but I think it will be difficult to completely live up to the perfection of Schlink's writing.     Become the reader yourself and pick up this book. It's just too good to pass up.
0312323867|5.0|An exciting book that you won't want to put down!   By Brittany Dunatov  Tuesday, November 11, 2008    Emily Giffin's bestseller book \\"Something Blue\\" in her series that was released in 2005 is worth reading and keeps you guessing and will make you want to read the next book. This book is fiction and is about how making decision can change your life for better or worse.     The storyline people can relate to because what's goes on in the book can be similar to situations that people experience in their own lives. While Emily giffin was writing this book she found out that she was pregnant with twin boys and used this life experience as material to put in her book as the main character Darcy also finding out that she is going to be a mother expecting two twins' boys. In the book the theme of cheating is used and I think that people can relate to this. In life your girlfriend, boyfriend, or someone can cheat on you that you are close to.    The author `s writing style gives us an idea of Darcy's character as being someone who is funny, upbeat, adventurous, and likes to take risks.     Darcy's description of London makes us feel like we are right there with her experiencing the city. In London the food is slightly different than the food you would eat in the United States. A ham and cheese in London, you would ask for a \\"croquet misters\\" but in America you just call it a regular ham, and cheese sandwich. The English accent is different in London, and their American dollar is not the same as our here. It doesn't look the same and doesn't have the same value. London is known for its beautiful buildings like the Knightsbridge, marble streets, and shopping at Harrods that is like our Macy's in the United States.    Throughout the book Darcy is comparing her relationship she had with Dex and Marcus.  Dex was someone who was caring, would surprise her on her birthday with cinnamon buns and candles, organized, and an all round good guy. Marcus is the total opposite. He is a good-looking guy, messy, doesn't make a lot of money, and has a bad work ethnic.     By the end of the book Darcy learns about her herself. She realizes that if you are not happy in a relationship and the person you are with is not right for you then cheating is not the answer.
B000A7S4B0|5.0|I like all of their albums, but I love this one.  One of my favorite albums from beginning to end by anyone.  The music is very layered and full with great instrumentation from mostly acoustic guitars and piano and harmonica.  Very soulful and smart from first note to the last.
B0015FML06|5.0|This DVD is really well done - no frills, the focus was just on the sight and sound, and the result is excellent. It has a really nice hardcover book format in a thick hard slipcase.  Great booklet. The only disappointment in this particular package is that the CD wasn't expanded.  If you love this music, you only need to decide whether you want this or just the DVD.
0679722610|5.0|Above all of his other books, Red Harvest is the essential Hammett read.  Dark, gritty, thought provoking and even humorous, this book delivers everything you could desire from a classic detective text.  To not enjoy and appreciate this book is to dismiss the genre as a whole.
B0017I1FO4|5.0|This is a great CD. It has a little bit of everything. Shinedown is one of those few bands that can pull anything off. If they were to sing the phone book you could still rock out to it.
159562015X|5.0|If you have not done anything like this before then try this book.  It is really just a quick activity (20min of reading/30min online test/20min post test review) that could change your life direction if you let it.  The concept is simple...you cannot fix your weaknesses so focus on you positives... It gives you some guidance on how to work on the natural talents you have to make you a better person overall.  Great read/activity for anyone!
B001F7MSFW|1.0|I loved the first Hellboy.  My dvd has been played over and over again.  I was really looking forward to seeing Hellboy II.  It arrived today and I couldn't wait to start watching it.  I will NOT finish it.  I think it was horrible and not worth the money paid for the dvd.  All three of us opted to shut it off without finishing it.  Maybe I'm just not watching it right - but in my opinion it does not measure up to what the first one was.  I'll just keep playing the first Hellboy over and over.  Hellboy II will not be played again.
B00188M5TM|5.0|\\"Changeling\\" is my first pick for Picture of the Year for 2008 and while I'm at it, I think Angelina Jolie should go up for Best Actress, too. I admit it, I haven't started the list of Oscar winners until I saw \\"Changeling\\" and I definitely think this film should be on the ballot for more than the Best Picture nod.      In brief, the story is based on a true life account about a single mom in the 1920's  who regretfully leaves her young son Walter home when she goes to work at the telephone company and returns to find he is gone.  She calls the LAPD and is told she must wait 24 hours to file a report.  After all, \\"Most of the kids come back by breakfast,\\" and later in the phone call, \\"by noon.\\"     When she continues to press the LAPD for help, they return a young boy who is circumcised and three inches shorter to her and tell her he's her son.  At that time, their best criminal experts all agree on that and the doctor even says \\"several months of trauma can shrink a kid's spine.\\"     Angelina Jolie plays single mom, Christine Collins.  She's strong, she's earnest, and she doesn't quit.  Unfortunately, in the 1920's those traits can land a woman in a mental institution.     This is not an escape film; however, it's a superlative example of how period pieces should be done.  Everything from the plug-in switchboard, to the fashions is right on.  Clint Eastwood does a superlative job directing and J. Michael Straczynski should be applauded for his work on the story as well.     Rebecca Kyle, November 2008
B001AQR3E4|1.0|I love this movie, but my rating is about \\"blu-ray\\" version.  There is NOTHING about this movie that is \\"hi def\\"  The package states 1080p hi def AND 480p/i standard version.  There is no way in the menus to play different \\"versions\\" and I'm CERTAIN I'm watching a regular 480p standard version of this movie.....    No new audio formats either....    There is NO reason to buy this movie on blu ray!  It's NOT high definition.
B000000ZGO|5.0|I first heard this song as a little girl on my Dad's stereo system and instantly fell in love with the funky groove of the music. Through my adulthood I would occassionally hear it but so much wanted a copy for myself.  I had an \\"old school friend\\" tell me the correct name of the song and album and KNEW I WOULD BEGIN MY MISSION TO LOCATE THE CD.  I DIDN'T HAVE TO LOOK FAR BECAUSE AMAZON OFFERS SUCH A WIDE VARIETY OF MUSIC.  MY FAVORITE SONG ON THE TRACK IS\\"HYPERBOLLICSASQUEALADUSQIC\\" I AM SURE I DID NOT SPELL THIS SONG CORRECTLY BUT THAT IS OK CAUSE I HAVE THE CD NOW
B00006AW2G|5.0|\\"Let It Bleed\\" is no less than the best album The Rolling Stones have ever recorded. Of course, these things are subjective and always open to dispute (even unto myself), but I put this album to play and I am immediately transported back to the future. I can remember exactly where I was and what I was doing when the first, ominous chords that open \\"Gimme Shelter\\" (the album's first song) start to chime through the speakers (or headphones). And yet, each time I listen to this album, it is like I have never heard it before. Like a great novel or film, \\"Let It Bleed\\" never fails to entertain, amaze or inspire. The music is transcendent--its simplicity reveals layers and layers of complexity, both in feeling and musicianship. Recorded during times of turmoil for the band (primarily the failure of founding member and resident decadent, Brian Jones, to show up in the studio even when he did show up in the studio and the realization that in order to survive as a band, they had to get out there and perform live again after a self-imposed two-year layoff), the music nevertheless is focused, urgent and immediate. Jagger and Richards (and Watts and Wyman with help from Mick Taylor, Ry Cooder, Al Kooper and even the beleaguered Mr. Jones) compose, play and sing like their very lives depended on it. The result is a collection of songs that are more like a suite of music--it is an album that one cannot just start and stop at random. It must be played from beginning to end with no pauses. When the last notes of \\"You Can't Always Get What You Want\\" fade away, I am transported, refreshed and ready to face the world without fear. I think to myself: \\"Again?\\" I decide to wait for another day before I play \\"Let It Bleed\\" yet one more time as I savor the aural beauty of this album. As Oscar Wilde once said about cigarettes, the same could be said about \\"Let It Bleed\\": \\"A cigarette is the perfect type of a perfect pleasure.  It is exquisite, and it leaves one unsatisfied.  What more can one want?\\" Hard Knox and Durty Sox, indeed! (And, yes! This Album MUST Be Played LOUD!)
B001F2W4Y2|5.0|This is the Album you have been waiting Tweanty Eight Years for AC/DC Fans!!!  Is It possible that They could out do their multi patinuim album BACK IN BLACK?  They may just have done so, as one listens to this album and all the songs seem to grow on you after eack listen.        They turn back the clocks of time and recapture their old school sound. All that stuff that followers have come to love is here on this album! This is probably in my opinion the best hard rock album of this decade!!    It's Great that Their Back!!!
1416594884|5.0|Great book, full of mystery and action. I highly recommend it to LeCarre's fans. Fast delivery and great price!
0061438294|5.0|Just finished the book this week, and I must say I am quite happy with my purchase! This is a great book that gives a very nice understanding of the limbic part of our brain (A part that reacts without conscious thought) and the reasons behind our body language to understand WHY the brain reacts with these certain resposes in our body language. One of the biggest troubles i'v had with body language is memerising what all the parts mean. But with this understanding of the Limbic brain I can now understand the WHY behind all the parts, and like other reviewers have said, this makes memorising SO MUCH easier as it changed the way I look at Body language.     For anyone really interested in body language, I would recommend you buy this book which will give you a great base understanding of the science behind our body language And then buy the \\"Definitive Book Of Body Language\\" Which in my view is like the \\"encyclopedia\\" of body language, These are the Must reads for Body language in my view. The combination of the two is really a knock out punch for a very good foundation in the understanding of Body Language.
B0018OAPAW|5.0|I'm glad I bought this CD, the quality is great, the songs are awesome and it has the old good sound of The Offspring and a refreshing new touch. I think there's only one song that I don't fully like, but when I play this CD I don't skip any songs and that's what in my opinion makes a great CD!
B0012Q732O|5.0|I just saw the movie. Its a great storyline. But above all, the special effects are amazing, worthy of watching on HD with a booming surround sound. I rented it at one of those vending machines at the supermarket. I wanna watch it in blue ray , once i get my PS3 this week. Enjoy.     Oh, and by the way. I'm sure the actors are getting a lot of heat in these reviews, but they're newcomers. So, you won't get the same tired old faces like cruise, foster or samuel l. jackson...lol. not that there's anything wrong with them but: I'm tired of these m-----f----- snakes!!! lol

B000003C2V|5.0|no Top 10 best death metal albums lists could ever be taken seriously if Human wasn't on it.  Keep that in mind; if you ever see anyone listing the Best death metal albums and this isn't on it, that is how you know that they are a liar, a fraud, and possibly a government operative.  In fact, if I were the one making the list, this would be number 1<br /><br />To the normal it seems grotesque<br />Connected by a bond of flesh<br />Two minds, two hearts, one soul<br />Separating mentally<br />An illusion of privacy<br />Together - they absorb each other's lives<br />As One - they will live and they will die<br />A living hell has begun
B0011NVC9I|4.0|Special effects are decent, any resemblance to the actual story is purely coincidental!  Too bad, as most students SHOULD read originals before watching \\"re-makes.\\"
B001DTPZNY|4.0|Nothing can compare with the original. That's a given. I doubt we'll ever forget the scene where that immense round boulder chases Indy down the cave tunnel.<br /><br />The following Indy movies each tried to top the last in ever escalating special effects. This is, in that respect, is the same. Some great SF sequences and the trademark tongue in cheek humor to make sure no one takes it seriously.<br /><br />Frankly, as I age along with Indy, I'm glad to see him still cracking his whip and making wisecracks. I had a lot of fun watching this even though part of the pleasure was remembering the films that lead up to it.<br /><br />I wasn't thrilled with the choice of \\"Mutt\\" (and did anyone NOT guess who he was going to turn out to be???) but he wasn't bad either. Blanchett was fantastic as always and it was great seeing Karen Allen again.<br /><br />It won't win awards (except, perhaps, for effects) and it won't make cinema history but it's a pleasant way to spent a few hours and a heck of a lot better than most of the flicks being released right now (YUCK!).

B000SM7QUC|5.0|The Heroin Diaries soundtrack is the best damn cd I've heard in years!  I first learned of Sixx AM at the Crue Fest this summer.  Great in concert and the cd takes me back to the live show!  I recommend, recommend, recommend it to anyone who likes to rock.  Terrific lyrics - really listen to the words - it relates to anyone (even if you are not or never were an addict).  A must have for your collection.
B001KQICHG|4.0|After several years of anticaipation, Genesis had returned to the stage last year, in a well-dedicated reunion of the trio of Phil Collins, Mike Rutherford and Tony Banks. But back in the 70's, when Genesis made humble beginnings, Peter Gabriel was the one behind the microphone, delivering storytelling, and showcased a true to life cult following that has been with the group for over 40 years. While last year, their catalog has been throughout the Phil Collins era with the hit albums like Invisible Touch and the innovative Duke, seeing a new light of day and brilliantly restored down to the soul from top to bottom. But, for Peter Gabriel fans of the Genesis era, and those who still adore his solo efforts have wanted to know what his days were like, now can hear them from scratch with this boxed set.<br /><br />Genesis 1970-1975 is the final boxed set of the acclaimed re-releases of the Genesis machine that has withstood the testiments of time. While the Phil Collins era boxed sets 1976-1982, and 1983-1998 are only available on CD and DVD, this is the only one that is also available for downloading to your MP3 Player, as well as CD/DVD. The collection is a hard core buy for Gabriel fans of the early days, and consist of their hit records: the elusive The Lamb Lies Down On Broadway (which you can only right now find on the boxed set), Nursery Cryme, Foxtrot, Selling England By The Pound, and Trespass. The songs have all been remastered beautifully from top to bottom, and bring in a splice for anyone who loved the early days. The collection includes the hits The Lamb Lies Down On Broadway, early day sonnets like The Chamber Of 32 Doors, Back In N.Y.C., the depths of Watcher Of The Skies and the epic drama of the storytelling of Supper's Ready. There are also some great b-sides and live recordings that have seen the light of day here, including the rare recording of Twilight Alehouse, and never-before heard live recordings from Jackson and the BBC on songs like Manipulation, which bring life into the long lost era. Sadly though, there are a few disadvantages with the collection. The first of which is that while the 70's era was highlighted well, the boxed set doesn't showcase their debut album From Genesis To Revelation. So hard core fans, don't get to listen to the making from original founding member Anthony Phillips. The second disadvantage is that with all the wait is that here, you can only get The recordings from The Lamb Lies Down On Broadway here, and not individually anywhere else, but for the extra cost, it is well worth the money.<br /><br />All in all, Genesis 1970-1975 is a great addition to your MP3 Player. This is the only one of the 3 boxed sets available for your MP3 recordings, and at nearly $40 to download from here, it is definitely a great purchase, and for those who want to say to Peter Gabriel that you know what you like in his wardrobe, than it is definitely right here.<br /><br />Songs: B+<br /><br />Price: B<br /><br />Remastering: B+<br /><br />Overall: Bich bring life into the long lost era.

B000058983|4.0|Some people (well, not too many I suppose) have put this album down because of its lack of memorable songs. I can understand that, the songs here don't hold up on their own as classics. But this album isn't about creating a bunch of sing-along tunes. It has to be regarded as a whole to be fully appreciated. FOREVER CHANGES is about creating something (at least back then) unheard of. The songs are often mystical and a bit weird, both in terms of music and lyrics. And the arrangements are sometimes peculiar but in an interesting way.  If you want some easy-listening, then forget this. But if you want something really original that works on other levels than great hooks, then chances are you're going to enjoy this. At least I do.
B0000DYKET|5.0|Wow, these shoes are amazing. I bought them used like three years ago, and they are just about the only thing I have worn since then - much to the chagrin of a couple more fashionable friends. They are comfortable, durable, easy to get on and off...I have had to get them repaired a couple times, but I have put them through hell. Now the sole has worn slick and I'm in the market for a new pair. Exactly like the pair I just had.    Things Keen Newports can do surprisingly well (from personal experience):    * Wading through rivers and streams  * Hiking  * Skateboarding  * Rock Climbing (nice grippy toe)  * Motorcycle riding (again, the rubber toe is leaps and bounds better than most sandals for kicking gears)  * Well, a lot more I'm sure. The only thing they're not great at is jogging. But I bet you knew that already.    For a comfortable, durable, amphibious shoe that will get you through the jungles and the deserts, this is the one.
B000OVLBGC|5.0|In a heartless time under a heartless regime, somehow, someone found a heart, and faced with a dilemma made a decision, that would impact the Lives of Others.<br /><br />It is a rare sign only seen in the best movies, and masterful how this movie builds up, and unwinds, and unwinds even more just as you think its already completely unwound.<br /><br />This story is as intricate as the inner working of a watch, make the slightest wrong adjustment and....<br /><br />So Ulrich Muhe gives an excellent performance as does Sebastian Koch as Dreyman.  Apparently, Muhe was bugged himself when he live in East Germany, and his ex wife sued him for mentioning this in a radio interview.<br /><br />Lives of Others won Best Foreign Language movie at the Oscars.  After watching the movie, I watched some of the earlier scenes over.  At around 8 minutes you see the actresses proclamation on stage, and the words she said set up two later scenes.  See if you can figure it out.<br /><br />If you're like me, and you love this movie, you will most probably also like Blackbook, also starring Sebastian Koch as the male lead.  Directed by Paul Verhoeven, of Basic Instinct and Total Recall fame.  One of the few movies I have bought in addition to watching.  Hope this was helpful.

B001KPK6Q2|4.0|Taylor Swift is what she is:  she's going to sing very sweet, innocent songs about love, life, and whatever else it is that she experiences.  This isn't going to make the jaded and critical among us very happy, since some can't see such innocence and happiness (for lack of a better term) as anything other than naivete.  But if you're not that sort of person, there's a lot to like here.  \\"Fearless\\" is a good opening track and something you'll probably hear on the radio for a while.  The combination of \\"Love Song\\" and \\"White Horse\\" make for a good \\"fairy tale that eventually falls apart\\" story.  \\"You Belong With Me\\" reminds me a lot of Avril Lavigne's \\"Sk8tr Boi\\" in a different genre, and \\"Breathe\\" is a sweet love/breakup song.  I don't find the music to be overly produced, and the album has a good heart.  I wouldn't call it one of the most spectacular albums I've ever heard, but I like Taylor's voice and I seem to be happier after I listen to it, and sometimes that's all you have to ask of your music.  Worth your time.

B001EYGOEM|5.0|First, the songwriting.  I am amazed at Taylor's ability to write from her experiences and her heart.  Teen or adult, you will be able to identify and feel what she's dealing with along with her.  Second, the production is clear and a sonic treat, easy to listen to.  I used to be a radio announcer, and we would say a CD like this has \\"ridearoundability,\\" meaning that you can listen to it in your car, enjoy it, and hardly if ever hit the \\"skip\\" button.  Third, the arrangements are excellent, not formulaic at all.  Each song stands well on its on, yet the \\"flow\\" of the CD is smooth and pretty nigh flawless.  Forth, she continues to improve vocally.  Guess that comes with practice and maturity.  One things for sure:  She has an emotionally nuanced and not-too-twangy voice that draws you into each song.  Best cuts?  \\"Fearless,\\" \\"Fifteen,\\" \\"Love Story\\" (wish they'd release her singing that one with Def Leppard on CMT's \\"Crossroads\\" -- incredible!), \\"Hey Stephen,\\" \\"White Horse,\\" \\"Breathe,\\" \\"You're Not Sorry,\\" \\"The Best Day,\\" and the song she wrote for the Summer Olympics, \\"Change.\\"  Enjoy!  I certainly have, and will!
B000EBD9TY|3.0|\\"A Streetcar Named Desire\\" is a classic portrayal of what both money and alcohol can do.   The movie also reflected on many taboo topics such as homosexuality, domestic violence and rape as well as Blanche's affair with a young man. This movie was way ahead of its time and opened the eyes of its audience as well as movies to come.  Brando's acting was intense, for his emotions kept the entire performance alive.  The acting of Stella and Blanche was good but their characters were much less dramatic then Stanley's, even Blanche's character did not compare for me. The movie has a good plotline but might be lost today because of its out datedness, the music in the background might just put a younger audience to sleep.  The themes are central today and a remake would definitely be a hit among the lazy film viewers of today.
B000001ZS5|4.0|Since hearing and later buying Oxygene and Equinoxe, from Amazon.com incidentally, I've made it my goal to buy at least all of Jean Michel Jarre's most popular albums or, if possible, to hear samples and decide which ones I myself liked enough to want to own. Oxygene was excellent and Equinoxe continued that trend. Following Equinoxe, Jarre put out Les Chants Magnetiques Magnetic Fields in I believe 1981. Though it's very different from either of his two prior albums with some tracks having a much more mechanical sound to them as well as a much more rhythmic element than even Equinoxe, I find Magnetiques to be almost as good as the first two.    Oxygene began with a quiet, delicate track that sort of grew as it progressed. Equinoxe starts out triumphant, tones down for a bit in track 2 and then suddenly springs back to life with track 3. Magnetiques comes out with guns a-blazin', so to speak. Track 1, which has got to be at least fifteen minutes long, remains upbeat throughout until near the end it sort of tones down a bit and what sound like trains start to phase in. Track 2, as others have pointed out, does get bogged down by annoying handclapping sounds, but other than that it's a cool one. Track 3, like part 3 of Oxygene, is little more than a bridge between two and four. I like it, don't get me wrong, but it does still sound like something that might play in an elevator, perhaps while you were waiting for maintenance to get you unstuck from between two floors of the building. Track four is kinda cool, sounding to me like something that might serve well as the theme song to a TV show. Track five is, of course, that damn Rumba. I'm not sure what to think of it. I can't say I don't like it because that would be a lie. It's...interesting. Actually if you want my honest opinion it sounds rather like something that might fit in a Super Mario Brothers game.    All in all, I find Magnetiques to be as good as it's made out to be. I was able to borrow a copy from a friend to listen to and I plan on getting myself a copy just as soon as finances allow. So if you're new to Jarre, I'd definitely recommend this album over much of his newer material.
0974872407|5.0|This is one of the best books I have ever read. It is interesting, the descriptions are vivid, the Spanish version is funny (sorry English speakers, I think you missed the \\"Spanish\\" sense of humor and  expressions all over this book), there was mystery, love, etc. Ruiz Zafon is an excellent story teller. Simply, I loved this book!<br /><br />Este libro es uno de los mejores que me he leido. Este libro es interesante, las descripciones son vividas, y la version en espanol es graciosa (creo que los que leyeron el libro en ingles se perdieron gran parte del sentido del humor espanol y de sus frases tan ocurrentes y por supuesto la belleza de nuestra lengua), tambien hubo misterio, amor, etc. Ruiz Zafon es un excelente narrador. Simplemente me encanto este libro.
B001CW7ZXK|2.0|This rating is for the presentation only, not the film! What do you get for the extra $$$? A box that will sit on your shelf, a softcover booklet with some weak humor, and the movie in a regular snap-case that will find its way into your regular DVD collection(sans oversize box).  What could have they done better? Publish the booklet as a mini- hardcover, included some liner notes/essays,vintage ads or reviews,included the CD soundtrack, a shotglass, postcards or some other kind of merch.   Pretty half-hearted effort.  Save your money and get the regular edition.

If you have no experience at all in guitar constructions, after seeing the many details, you may be somewhat affraid of begining. But this book do is a reference. Congratulations to the author!
B000V86OKG|5.0|This is the best series on TV and the DVD just enhanced the experience.  If you are a fan of the show or have thought about watching it, you should buy both seasons 1 & 2 ASAP and get slicing!
B00005JPS8|5.0|When I saw Ironman for first time I thought, this is a movie any supeheroe fan must own, now that I own it I confirm that, great movie, excellent effects and what can I say about Robert Downey, Jeff Bridges, Wyneth Paltrow and Terrence Howard, they are great actors.
B00005JPO1|5.0|Great to see that Lucas and Spielberg were able to produce another great hit. Nice to see Indy back for his fourth adventure. Great updating to make sure Harrison Ford could still play the part. And can he! Would love to see if they could make a fifth, but I get the feeling this is it for this great franchise.
B00005OCMR|5.0|Tron was a part of my childhood growing up in the 70's and 80's: a science fiction fantasy set in a perceived future where the mainframe computer would become a force to be reckoned with. The brilliant, albeit primitive, merging of photography and digital imagery, combined with the incredible musical score by Wendy Carlos (a deliberate hybrid of orchestral and electronic instrumentation - the soundtrack alone is worth purchasing), made this film a milestone and a must-have for any sci-fi lover.    End of line.
B00125WAWS|5.0|Not what you think it would be.  Great moving movie. Only thing I didn't like was Denzel's hair.
B001DTPZNY|4.0|This movie is by no means the best Indiana Jones movie out there, but it is certainly worthy of being in the franchise.  This movie has a very similar feel to the original trilogy, but it has some differences, too.  Lucas and Spielberg have mentioned that the original movies were made in the style of the old 1930's serials.  They decided to film this one a little more like the 1950's sci-fi \\"B\\" movies.  This works very well in the new movie, which uses the much of the same witty dialogue and over-the-top action sequences that make the Indiana Jones series so unforgettable.  I definitely recommend this movie to any Indy fan.
0743298039|5.0|Early on in Diane Setterfield's 'The Thirteenth Tale', the (fictional) author of the aforementioned 'tale' utters the line I have quoted in the title of this review, \\"When one is nothing, one invents. It fills a void.\\"  Upon reaching the end of this novel, this one line holds greater meaning than initially suspected.    With so many reviews of this book, I am hesitant to provide a plot synopsis (amongst the many), and will focus on what I consider to be the book's strengths and weaknesses.    Strengths: Where to begin? This is a wonderfully atmospheric, well plotted, literary tale with so many parallels to classic literature tales that it's hard for any lover of classic fiction to NOT like....others have called this simply a 'ghost' story, and in ways it is, but it's that and so much more. Setterfield has crafted such a wonderful premise and tale to support it, with so many subplots, that virtually every character mentioned in this novel is of great interest, and has a 'place' in the story that unfolds.    Weaknesses: I only have one criticism of this novel, for which I have not deducted any 'stars' in this review. One thing that typically 'irritates' me as a reader is when someone is recounting a story, giving a narrative, and somehow has details to relate of conversations that they were not privy to, and do not explain how they learned the details. Granted, in this instance, the details were vital to the story, yet I still loathe the 'leap' one must take in order to simply accept that the person narrating the story 'somehow' found out what they are telling of. Whereas Ms. Winter's narrative of her life story is supposed to be the truth, I hesitate to think that she simply invented filler details....perhaps it was an embellishment of what little she DID know to be fact, but it still leaves me feeling a bit 'flat' in reading such things.    That said, this is a wonderful story....a perfect read for crisp fall afternoons when the shadows seem a bit longer and appearsooner in the day. A tale of death and rebirth, being freed by the truth, and the unburdening of the soul, I plan to recommend this novel to fellow readers over and over and over again.
0061478784|5.0|Excellent. I loved fairytales growing up and read all of then reread and reread so many times that I had them memorized. Diane has done the job. Her books are just as delightful and completely enjoyable at 14 or 40. My daughter and I are reading all of her books and I just finished this one last night. I loved it!    I highly recommend her books to anyone who loves a good fairytale. They are better by far than any of the other attempts I have read over the years. and I have read most of them!! I love books and this author is a winner!
B001GQ2TGA|3.0|When she came out with Oiche Chiuin in 1989, I had known a full-blown holiday album was in the future. A few years back, she teased us with her Christmas Secrets EP, which was very delightful. Finally, with \\"And Came Winter,\\" there was tremendous anticipation for something really special. Something that would be played year after year with the likes of Bing Crosby, Nat King Cole, and others. Something truly classic that would endear generations.    This isn't it.    Only three songs are truly worthy, but all in different ways. \\"White is in the Winter Night\\" sounds 'traditional' - joyful, upbeat, a caroling gem. This is the most genuine song on the entire album.    \\"Dreams are More Precious\\" is subdued, gentle, and a great 'tuck-the-kids in' on Christmas Eve song. Very nice.    \\"My! My! Time Flies!\\" is almost completely out of place on the album. I laughed the first go around. But, as she did with \\"The River Sings\\" from \\"Amarantime,\\" where she went a little techno on us - showed us she's got groove. 'Time Flies' goes out on a limb and unto itself, it is a sensational track - but its fit on the CD is questionable. It probably would have been better off as part of a CD single instead.    The rest of the album is either re-workings of previous efforts (the title track and \\"Oiche Chiuin\\"), while the rest are a bit simplistic and no harmonies that should of taken Enya into fresh directions.    The potential for something to be treasured as a holiday staple is really not what AWC turned out to be. She has unbelievable talent and her fan's expectations demand a better effort.
B000Q67876|5.0|this is my favorite movie of all time. it truly is an amazing story that captures and keeps your attention throughout. it is truly a masterpiece. i haven't purchased this particular version of the movie, so i dont know how good the quality is, but if you have any doubts about the quality of the specific disc being sold here i am fairly positive it is excellent quality. but if you do have doubts simply go buy the disc from an actual store, or an online movie store that specifically sells new, unopened movies. fantastic film. i suggest buying this movie, you will love it.
B00003CX5P|5.0|Its time people realize somthing important. When George Lucas sat down to write star wars in the early 1970's he wrote episodes 1-6. Not 4-6, 1-3 but ALL six!!! He couldn't make a movie that long. So he came up with the story from ep 4 because he felt it was the best part for the time. It was the greatest film of all time. He did not expect it to do that well. He was exhausted from working on it, and vowed never to direct again, which is why he did not direct ep 5 and ep 6. However, years went by, and so did the technology (which his company developed!! ILM) which became CG. Now that it existed, he could tell the story he wanted to tell- ep 1-3. BY KNOCKING THIS MOVIE YOU ARE KNOCKING LUCAS HIMSELF!! Its his baby. NOW PLEASE FOR THE LOVE OF GOD, get over Jar-Jar!! I was frankly blown away by the lightsaber scenes in this movie. And the other characters-awesome. For those that think Jar-Jar was stupid what about C3PO and R2-D2 they were comic relief as well.
0385340990|5.0|It's been a while since I have read a book that made me smile, laugh, and not want to put down.

I highly recommend this book.

B00192KCQ0|4.0|Real good album. They play as a coherent group again. SO much better than the last album.
0446604844|5.0|This is an older novel that has lost none of its steam. Their are many twists and turns, but for the most part they retain the plausibility that often goes out the window. Since this is an older book and technology plays such a strong role, there are many things which technologically are out of date. If you look at it as a historical novel, albeit recent, that potential problem area fades rapidly. Highly recommended.
B000ZLFALI|5.0|Julie Taymor has done a remarkable job of capturing the essence of the 60's;  the color is right, the sequence of events is right, the escalation of emotions is right and the music is right.  I was 23 in 1967 and lived on the lower East Side of New York City where most of the scenes in the film takes place.   It all happened the way Taymor describes from the street people, to the draft,  to the Bread and Puppet Theatre marching down Fifth Avenue.  So if you want to experience or relive that moment in time or explain to your children why that moment made such a difference watch this movie.
B001DTPZNY|4.0|This Indiana Jones effort is, in many ways, like Godfather III. It is an excellent movie but somehow seems to fall a bit short of its predecessors. There are some great moments to enjoy, like Shia LeBeouf's entrance looking like a young Marlon Brando on a motorcycle. Very 50's, indeed! If I could put my finger on one thing it would be the story line. The first three films in this series seemed to use a lot more of the globe in their stories. The entry is less diverse. Production values are excellent. It is an excellent film. However, for repeat viewing we will likely favor Raiders of the Last Ark, Last Crusade, Temple of Doom, and Crystal Skull in that order.
0783229526|4.0|The reviewer is right who stated the mainstream doesn't get Gilliam. Bottom line is people will still be talking about this movie 100 years from now when most of the Academy pop favs will be forgotten. I thought I had to clarify what is actually happening and why Depp is in LV to begin with.    \\"The novel Fear and Loathing in Las Vegas accounts for two trips to Las Vegas, Nevada, that Hunter S. Thompson and attorney Oscar Zeta Acosta took in March and April of 1971. He was writing an exposé for Rolling Stone magazine about the killing of Ruben Salazar, the Mexican-American television journalist whom officers of the Los Angeles County Sheriff's Department shot in the head, at close range, with a tear gas grenade during the National Chicano Moratorium March against the Vietnam War in 1970.    A source for the story was the attorney Oscar Zeta Acosta, Esq., a prominent Mexican-American political activist. Thompson told Acosta that Sports Illustrated magazine had offered him a job writing photograph captions for the annual Mint 400 desert race in Las Vegas. Finding it difficult for a brown-skinned Mexican to openly talk with a white reporter in the racially tense atmosphere of Los Angeles, Calif., they decided Las Vegas would be the more comfortable place to discuss the story.\\"

'Accept Yourself',(my very favourite Smiths song) 'Back to the Old House', 'This Night Has Opened My Eyes', 'William It Was Really Nothing', 'Girl Afraid', each and every one a unique, igneous classic. Not a falter, not one second of filler, 'HoH' is magnificently consistent.<br />The Morrissey/Marr symmetric is ablaze, the Rourke/Joyce auxiliary is pyretic. We are talking about rock music which is high up the rungs of the evolutionary ladder, and there isn't much above it. Funny, moving, passionate, and not without it's fair share of dash and glisten, this THRASHES a Cure, New Order, U2, or whoever else were making big noises at the time.<br /><br />Political as hell, with an unholy amount of jocular cynicism, 'HoH' is frighteningly perceptive. Morrissey spoke to a ready and waiting sub-generation, eddying up the fun-factor, while deceiving others into thinking he was moping and depressed.<br /><br />Yes, people actually think his lyrics are depressing; a reassuring thought as 'HoH' once again rips through your speakers.

B00127RAJY|5.0|Great workout with appropriate progressive levels. Variety of exercises is motivating an having persons with beginner skills and advance skills on screen at same time helps with adjusting to personal levels of involvement.    Only disappointment with DVD is being unable to fast forward beyond disclaimers and introductory information.  Having listened/watched the 1st, 2nd, 3rd time, viewer shouldl be able to go to menu, fast forward, skip all intrductory materials and get straight to workout.
0061251305|5.0|As someone who has read dozens of management and leadership books I was curious to see how Tribal Leadership - Leveraging Natural Groups to Build a Thriving Organization would be any different from the others.  I was pleased to find that it is focused on leaders and the building blocks of any company, the workers.  This book describes in detail how to identify where you are in one of five stages.  The authors let you know what each stage looks like, sounds like, the pitfalls of and ways to move forward from each one.  They do so from the basis of extensive research which is laid out at the back if you want to review it.  I found the book to be funny, engaging and useful for any and all workers and levels of management.  This is a must read if you want to improve your efforts in the work place and / or become a better leader to others.

0786852550|4.0|The Amulet of Samarkand (2003) is the first book in Jonathan Stroud's Bartimaeus Trilogy. This trilogy has the unique honor of having been banned in its entirety for the books' presentations of the occult. They also feature magnificent cover art by Melvyn Grant (who also has a ridiculously clever website). For many readers, that would be enticement enough. I didn't know about the book banning, but the cover art and blurb pushed it onto my ever-increasing \\"to read\\" list. A recommendation from a trusted YA librarian pushed it over the top.<br /><br />Nathaniel, one of the novel's main characters, lives in London. Like most large cities, many of London's movers and shakers are to be found in government positions of influence. What most people don't know is that these powerful men and women get up to more than politicking when behind closed doors. They all have power, certainly, but very little (none depending on who you ask) belongs to them. Not permanently at least. Working in obscurity, under strict rules of engagement (with stricter punishments should something go awry), demons are the real power behind London's elite.<br /><br />Nathaniel is six when he is torn away from his birth parents and sent to live with his new master, another magician.<br /><br />As in many fantasy novels, the power of naming plays an important role here. Demons are summoned with the knowledge of their real names. If you know the demon's real name, you can control them. Similarly, if a demon learns the true name of a magician (in this case their given name) the demon has the same level of control. No magician knows their true name in order to avoid just that kind of problem.<br /><br />By the age of eleven, Nathaniel has adjusted to his life as an apprentice and eagerly anticipates two events: the day when he will pick his name as a magician, and the day he will become a great magician, like his idol William Gladstone, remembered by all. Nathaniel does choose his name in due time, but his dream of greatness, is put into serious question when Simon Lovelace, a prestigious magician, publicly humiliates Nathaniel.<br /><br />Enraged, Nathaniel bides his time learning spells and waiting until the day he will be ready to exact revenge. Enter Bartimaeus, the novel's other main character, and a djinni with a fondness for footnotes in his first-person narration. Initially summoned as an instrument of revenge, Nathaniel soon learns that Bartimaeus is not easily contained.<br /><br />When Nathaniel's brilliant revenge becomes murder, espionage and conspiracy djinni and boy strike an uneasy detente to see if both of them can survive the machinations Bartimaeus has set in motion under Nathaniel's orders.<br /><br />The Amulet of Samarkand alternates viewpoints, sometimes being told in witty first-person by Bartimaeus (filled with references to his 5000 year career as a brilliant djinni), other times following Nathaniel in a third-person voice. Combined, the narrations make for an original fantasy that is witty and sharp.<br /><br />More interesting, especially as the trilogy continues, is the dynamic between Nathaniel and Bartimaeus. While the djinni is more entertaining of the two, Nathaniel is often more compelling. Watching him mature from an innocent boy to a calculating magician in his own right, Stroud creates tension as readers are forced to wonder will Nathaniel be a villain or a hero by the end of the story?ream of greatness, is put into serious question when Simon Lovelace, a prestigious magician, publicly humiliates Nathaniel.<br /><br />Enraged, Nathaniel bides his time learning spells and waiting until the day he will be ready to exact revenge.

B001FEA9QU|4.0|I'll be honest and say that I liked about half of these songs, but at least with Amazon MP3, I can select those individual songs (borrowed the CD). Out of the songs I liked, most of them were amazing, while I'll easily forget the other songs.     Under normal listening conditions, I didn't notice it, but with headphones, the cymbals sounds like they were filled with mashed potatoes. Stupid loudness war.
B001GQ2TGA|2.0|Ouch..... This is such a repeat of previous works, it's actually embarrassing. Not only have we heard all of this before, many times over, not just the arrangements and choice of instruments but also the harmonies, rhythms and basic melodies. I so remember how all these ideas were once (on her first three albums) so very fresh and original... And to be honest, they were better done as well, she used to have so much passion and energy in her music, no matter how relaxing the results were.    On the bright side, it does all sound crisp and clear, so if you're in the mood for an even more mainstream, middle of the road, minimized Enya, this may work out just fine for you!    Personally I did enjoy \\"O Come Emmanuel\\" and \\"Last Time By Moonlight\\". Also, the \\"My Time Flies track\\", well, it shows she can still be inventive, finding new musical territory, if only she takes the space for it. That took guts! Had she taken more risks like this one, I'd have been on board for sure. Now, it's one for the archive, and next time I'll research carefully before buying a new Enya album.

B001AX9DT0|3.0|I was looking forward to this album and had a hard time finding it in retail stores- which I thought would be a good sign... but I must admit that since getting it I have not listening to it over and over.

I really liked the first single on this CD You are the Best Thing... but did NOT like Meg White and Hey Me Hey Mama at all...  just disappointed all in all.
0060935464|5.0|... mainly because it is such a good story and so well written. Come to think of it, not much of this book is really about the rape and crime. It is about childhood, growing up and growing prejudice. It is about not only racism but also feminism. Scout, the main character, has such a lovely personality and I really started to like her. It was almost like I knew her and parts of me fell in love with Jem, her brother. I found parts of the slang a bit hard to read and it took a good 100 pages before the story had me that intrigued that I couldn't put it down. Sometimes you read a book and you really do realize why some books last with us and literature forever and why some don't. This book deals with human joy and suffering, ideals and rebels, crime and punishment and of course of race and sad part of the history of the south.    Even though this book was so good (or maybe because this book was so good) I thought it was very tough to get through. I read five pages then I had to just take a breather. But after 100pages I really found it hard to put the book down. I do think, however, that it will benefit from a second reading. Therefore it will not be long until I follow the adventures of Scout and Jem once again.
B0013ND30M|5.0|Disney's classic Sleeping Beauty has been my 15-year-old daughter's favorite movie since she was very young.  Our old VHS tape broke ages ago, and we've been unable to buy a new copy on DVD until now.  In typical Disney style, this movie will be available only for a limited time and then gone again for several years.  If you even think your family might want this movie eventually over the next 10 years, buy it now.<br /><br />Using the same long-term perspective, I almost bought the Blue-Ray version.  However, we don't have a Blue-Ray player yet, and my daughter got this movie as a birthday present to watch now - not eventually.<br /><br />Movie Review:  Among Disney animation movies, Sleeping Beauty is generally acknowledged as having the most dark and sinister of villians.  The evil witch actually become a black fire-breathing dragon for the major fight scene.  Otherwise the film is as much about the prince as the princess, with plenty of comic relief scenes thrown in from their royal fathers and the three good faries.  Clean enjoyable fun for the family, but let the little ones snuggle close the first time they watch it.
1433502410|5.0|I still remember getting my first study Bible. It was many years ago, probably in the late 80's, that my parents gave me the gift of a brand new NIV Study Bible. I used that Bible daily for many years though it was eventually replaced by a New Geneva Study Bible in the NKJV translation and after that by a Reformation Study Bible in the ESV. Today, if you drop by my home in the early morning, you are likely to see me reading from the Literary Study Bible, also in the ESV. On the bookcase in my office I have a copy of the Archaeological Study Bible (NIV), the MacArthur Study Bible (NASB) and The Apologetics Study Bible (HCSB). A visit to a local Christian bookstore will turn up many more and a search of publishers' \\"Coming Soon\\" lists will show more still. Truly there is no lack of study Bibles available to us. And into this crowded field steps a newcomer, the ESV Study Bible.    Though I typically will not review a book until I have read every word, I have had to make an obvious exception for this title. Reading every word of the 20,000 study notes and the more than 50 articles would be a time-consuming task. This Bible's 2,752 pages boast almost 2 million words. This makes it around 700 pages longer than most of the other study Bibles available today. However, I have had access to the complete text for several weeks now and have taken many opportunities to read through parts of the Bible.    The ESV team has done an excellent job of generating excitement for the ESV Study Bible and particularly so among the type of person who tends to read my book reviews. So in this review I will try to cut through the hype and, to the best of my ability, judge this new Bible on its own merits. After all, at $35 or $40 for the hardcover edition (and upwards of $200 for the premium calfskin edition) this Bible is not an insignificant investment.     How to Use a Study Bible  There are some Christians who feel that study Bibles are not ultimately helpful to Christians. After all, wehave been given the Holy Spirit who promises to us that He will help us to know and to apply the Scriptures. While I understand these concerns, I feel that study Bibles can be immensely helpful and especially so to those who do not have extensive reference libraries or extensive theological training. However, these Bibles must be used properly. The biblical text must book-end any study of Scripture. The Introduction to the ESV Study Bible says it well. \\"The best way to use a study Bible, therefore, is always to begin and end with the words of the Bible. We should always begin by reading the Bible's actual words, seeking with our hearts and our minds to understand these words and apply them to our lives. Then, after starting with the words of the Bible itself, we can turn to the study notes and many other study Bible resources for information about the background to the text, for the meaning of puzzling words or phrases, and for connections to other parts of the Bible. Finally, we should return again to the Bible itself, reading it with a new and deeper understanding, asking God to speak through his Word to the situation of our life and to draw us near to himself.\\" We will proceed through this review with the understanding that the notes and maps and articles and cross-references within any study Bible, helpful though they may be, are only supplementary to the words of God.   ESV  It goes without saying that the heart of the ESV Study Bible is the English Standard Version. This is considered by many biblical scholars to be a superior translation of the Bible and it is fast becoming the de facto translation amongst conservative and Reformed Christians. For the purposes of this review I will not defend or criticize the ESV as a translation. However, it bears mention that, while I am not as dogmatic as some when it comes to Bible translations, I do feel that the ESV is the best translation available today. As I understand the issues, it represents the best combination of readability and faithful translation. It is a joy to read and I find it as simple as any translation to memorize. While there are several other excellent English translations available, the ESV is top of the class.   Look & Feel  The ESV Study Bible has launched with eight editions: Hardcover, TruTone Nat Brown, TruTone Classic Black, Black Bonded Leather, Burgundy Bonded Leather, Black Genuine Leather, Burgundy Genuine Leather and Premium Calfskin Leather.   In any edition the ESV Study Bible looks great. It is contemporary in its coloring (white is dominant with orange accents in the hardcover) and in the traiangle which shows up throughout (on the cover, to mark headings, and even as a bullet for lists of information). The rectangle has no deeper significance than a simple design element. In an interesting but effective design decision, the TruTone editions have this triangle stitched to the cover. The leather editions have \\"ESV\\" in large gold letters on the spine with \\"Study Bible,\\" \\"English Standard Version\\" and \\"Crossway\\" in smaller gold type. The TruTone has the same text but with the \\"ESV\\" embossed. The hardcover features black and orange backgrounds on the spine with the text printed over top. The standard ESV guarantee applies to these Bibles, meaning that a customer who discovers manufacturing defects during normal use can return the Bible to have it replaced with one of equal or greater value.    The Bible is made to be durable. It is smyth sewn which is the binding process considered by many to be the best and longest-lasting method. It allows the Bible to lie flat even on page one and on page 2,752 (at least in the TruTone). It is printed on \\"high-opacity, high-quality French Bible paper\\" and in a single-column format with the cross-references in the inside margin. The paper is thin and light but still sturdy. My two year-old put the Bible to the test when she inadvertently stepped on it while it was lying open. The page wrinkled under her heel but did not tear. I also learned from her that chewing gum can be removed from the cover of the TruTone while permanent marker cannot. The fonts are very dark and easy to read with a heavy black serif font for the biblical text and a thin black sans-serif for the notes and cross-references. The page headings are in a bold gray with page numbers in a thin gray. Chapter numbers are a large gray serif font while headings are italicized black sans-serif. The pages display a fair bit of bleed-through where, when you look at a page, you can see the ink showing through from the previous page or two. Most of us are accustomed to this bleed-through in our Bibles. Where it is a bit more apparent and distracting is where it shows through on the maps and illustrations.    One feature that has received much attention in the ESV Study Bible is its use of color. Most study Bibles offer maps and illustrations only in grayscale. The ESV Study Bible, though, offers full-color illustrations and maps. This is quite a nice feature. The splashes of color throughout, including colored highlighting and shading, are unexpected to my eye but very effective. Though the standard glossy maps in the back of the Bible are superior in quality to the ones scattered throughout, even the smaller maps are nicely done and provide important geographical context without having to slip to the Bible's final pages. The illustrations, commissioned specifically for this project, are very well done and nicely supplement the notes.    ESV Study Bible Online  The ESV Study Bible is one of only a couple of study Bibles to offer an extensive online component to accompany the Bible. Included with each Bible is a registration code that will allow the customer to access the ESV Online Study Bible. There they will find the complete text of the Bible along with all of the study notes, articles, maps, and all the other features of the Bible. Unique online features include the ability to create and save personalized online notes; to search and follow interactive links between notes, maps, articles, charts, timelines, illustrations, and cross-references; and to listen to audio recordings of the ESV. It adds interactive features that are only possible in a computer-based environment. While the online component is a useful addition to the Bible (and a free one!), at this time it seems under-developed and I suspect many readers will find that they do not refer to it very often.   Format  Each book of the Bible begins with an extensive introduction. This may include sections dealing with Time, Date and Title; Author; Theme; Key Themes; Purpose, Occasion and Background; Literary Features; Outline; and so on. Particularly important is the History of Salvation Summary which sets each of the books within the context of the wider body of Scripture and hence within the history of salvation. Introductions may also include timelines, maps, and notes on literary features specific to that book. In every case, the reader will receive a thorough explanation as to the book's authorship, purpose and context in God's plan of salvation.   The text notes vary in density but typically comprise about half of each page in the New Testament and perhaps a third in the Old Testament. They focus primarily on explanation and rarely on application. In one handy feature, highlighted notes correspond to primary points in the outline while highlighted verses and headings within the notes correspond to secondary points in the outline.    Scholarship  The ESV Study Bible has been produced by as good a group of scholars as any study Bible. The General Editor is Wayne Grudem, the Theological Editor is J.I. Packer, the Old Testament Editor is C. John Collins and the New Testament Editor is Thomas Schreiner. The study note contributors represent a broad cross-section of reputable Evangelical scholars. The articles included within the Bible have been contributed by some well-known pastors and scholars, including John Piper, David Powlison, Darrell Bock, Leland Ryken, R. Kent Hughes, Daniel Wallace, and many more.   Controversial Theology  One concern people are likely to have when considering a new study Bible concerns the theological perspective offered in the notes. Does this particular study Bible take a Reformed or Arminian position on salvation? A complementarian or egalitarian perspective on gender roles? An amillennial or premillennial position on the end times? I looked through many of the notes seeking what this Bible says on some of the more common controversies: end times, spiritual gifts and soteriology. I found this an interesting comparison with the Reformation Study Bible. It seems to me that the Reformation Study Bible came from a much more narrowly-defined theological position; it was Reformed, it was cessationist, it was amillennial. The ESV Study Bible, on the other hand, offers a wider or less-defined perspective. Where the doctrine is clear and undisputed among Evangelicals, so too are the notes. But where doctrines are controversial and within the area of Christian freedom or disputable matters, the notes tend not to take a firm position, even when the author or editor is firmly in one camp or the other. Whether this is positive or negative may well depend on the individual reader.   To satisfy my curiosity, I opened my NIV Study Bible, Reformation Study Bible, MacArthur Study Bible and ESV Study Bible and compared their notes on several areas of controversial theology--end times, predestination and spiritual gifts. None of these Bibles offered notes that were unbiblical so I was left looking for the differences in perspective. In general I found that the MacArthur Study Bible offered the most defined position. This makes good sense as it represents the position of a single individual. This was followed by the Reformation Study Bible which offers the position of many individuals but each of them drawn from a very consistent theological position. The ESV Study Biblecame next, offering a charitable but open view on most of these issues. The NIV Study Bible seemed almost to shy away from some of the issues. So while it is clear that the ESV Study Bible is not distinctly Reformed in its position, neither is it Arminian. It is not cessationist or continuationist and is neither amillennial nor premillennial. In fact, it seems as if it emulates the parent who tells one of his children to cut the last piece of cake in half and the other to choose the first piece. In many cases a person from one perspective wrote the notes while a person from the other perspective screened them. This ensures the notes maintain both charity and some degree of objectivity in those areas of dispute.    Having looked at the areas of dispute, I would not hesitate to recommend the ESV Study Bible to either new or mature Christians. The matters at the heart of the faith are described and defended while the matters of lesser importance are presented charitably and non-dogmatically.    Conclusion  I suspect that many of the people reading this review will already be owners of at least one study Bible. I feel it is important to affirm that there is nothing innately wrong with the Reformation Study Bible, The New Geneva Study Bible, the MacArthur Study Bible and many of the other similar products. If you are currently using one of these Bibles and are happy with it, there may be fewer compelling reason to rush out and purchase the ESV Study Bible. I have used the Reformation Study Bible and its predecessor for many years with great benefit. I have no doubt that I will continue to refer to it.    With that said, I think the ESV Study Bible is an incredible resource. A long list of endorsers have expressed their excitement for its theological faithfulness, its accessibility, its insight, its scholarship, its practicality and its sheer excellence. I would simply append my name to this list. I agree wholeheartedly with C.J. Mahaney who writes, \\"I can't imagine a greater gift to the body of Christ than the ESV Study Bible. It is a potent combination indeed: the reliability and readability of the ESV translation, supplemented by the best of modern and faithful scholarship, packaged in an accessible and attractive format. A Christian could make no wiser investment for himself, a pastor could recommend no better resource for his congregation.\\" This is a powerful resource and one that can aid any reader of Scripture. It is one I recommend wholeheartedly.
B001C3KCSY|5.0|This song is a plea from someone trapped beyond the past, calling closer.     A trembling and cascading marriage of words and music, truly beautiful are both, and never has a song been more defining as a reminder that there are those who are shaking the bars of invisible prisons and those listening to the rattling who are holding the keys. This is the embodiment of that longing to be free, that unconscious urging in all of us for something unseen, something lost in eternity, lost in a dream, but sung sweetly and heard clearly in this, The Kings of Leon: Closer.       let us out. and bring us closer...    Sin Cerely  ~ D
B000002UAX|5.0|This album is perfect, and it's imperfection makes it that way. If you could only own one album, this is it. It has it all. It's influence is incalculable. Sell everything you own, and just listen to this. Really.
B001F12J3Y|1.0|I just wanted to let everyone know that nicer glasses don't work any better. I purchased a set of nice high quality plastic glasses hoping that this would correct the horrible double image with the cardboard glasses but it did not. The image looks exactly the same so don't waste any more of your money on that idea. It's too bad, this was such a wonderful movie in 3D.
0375826726|2.0|I have to say that the this series is getting worse with every new book.  Every weakness of Eragon gets amplified in Eldest, and amplifed more in Brisingr.  The writing style is boring.  It's too verbose.  The characters just talk too much and unnaturally. If Paolini could write this same book in half the number of pages, it would be excellent.  It's a book that I just could not read for more than an hour or so.  I just had to put it down because the reading was just too boring--too many words (or pages) used for a simple idea.  But the story line is the saving grace and is what kept me coming back every couple of days to see how the story progresses.  And the cycle repeats:  too boring, must put down, then curiosity made me pick it up again some later time.  Sometimes I had to resort to skimming through the pages just to get through the boring part.    In short, 4 stars for plot, 1 star for writing.      And it makes me want to go back and re-read The Lord of the Rings one more time (now that's good writing).
B000FGGE7C|4.0|First time I watched this movie it didnt make a whole lot of sense to me. I gave it another shot and it turned out to be a killer story and movie. Give it a chance and it will grow on you.
B001EYGOEM|3.0|I was very excited to hear this album. I fell in love with her voice and her songwriting on the first album. When I first heard a preview to \\"Change\\" I was disappointed. Then \\"Love Story\\" was released as a single and I had renewed hope for this album. After listening to it a few times, I'm not completely impressed. It feels like the producers were trying to aim her into a more \\"pop\\" act and not allow her to have the same freedom that she had on the last album. Songs such as \\"You're Not Sorry\\", \\"Change\\" and \\"Fearless\\" just really aren't that good. There are a few gems on this album. Such as \\"Fifteen\\", \\"The Best Day\\", \\"Hey Stephen\\" and \\"Love Story\\". For the most part this album is strictly producer throw up, which isn't surprising coming out of Nashville these days. Next time around, I hope she get's her freedom back. The last thing I want is her to become the next \\"crossover\\" act. That's already happened to one of my favorite female artists (Sara Evans). Not Taylor too!!
1932907009|4.0|Save the Cat is a screenwriters guide with claws. Most of the stuff you read in guides has been said before in lots of ways, but Snyder keeps the information fresh. Instead of saying \\"Make your protagonist likeable,\\" Snyder uses the cat metaphor. Show him being nice. The info is presented with humor. It's like having lunch with a script doctor who's an industry insider. You come away feeling able to get back to work saving your own little kittens.
B001GAPC1K|5.0|My husband loved the movie and couldn't wait to own the video of this film.  The price was good and the ordering a no brainer.  Thanks Amazon.
B001DXS4E2|5.0|I am not a fan of the colourization of black and white films, but this one is really terrific in colour and those responsible are to be congratulated.  Thoroughly recommended.
1400032717|4.0|In addition to all the other unusual aspects of this novel, it's also worth noting that it is in some ways a postmodern, self-referential novel. The 15-year-old boy who is the protagonist and the first-person \\"author\\" refers from time to time to the fact that he is writing a novel -- i.e., this novel, and to Siobhan's encouraging words to him regarding his writing project. He demurs that he has no sense of humor so that the book cannot be funny. Of course, the irony is that it is funny in its own self-referential way.<br /><br />I felt that the book trailed off at the end and became less interesting. Still, this is a memorable novel.
031606792X|5.0|I know a lot of people didn't like the 4th book but I personally really enjoyed it. A lot of the reason people didn't like it was because there was a lot of big changes in the book. It's funny that people have been screaming the entire time for Edward to change her already, but when he finally does everyone seemed to have a fit. I don't think a lot of people thought it through what it would actually mean for Bella to be a vampire other than she would get to live forever with Edward. As for everything changing and it wasn't just about their love I think that it needed to change. Think about it if Stephenie Meyer would have wrote 4 books about how Bella would keep being clumsy and having to be helpless compared to other Vampires then would we really want to read it? Change is inevitable. In order for the story to evolve then there had to be some changes. However I don't think that Stephenie could end this amazing world she's created just yet, personally I think that there is a whole lot of story still left to tell, only this time not from Bella's perspective. One of the things that I was really excited about in BD was the fact that Jacob imprinted on Renesme (btw I hate the name but oh well) as soon as I read that I had this overwhelming feeling of hope that Stephenie Meyer HAD to continue with another series with the main focus of it being Jacob and Renesme.   Think about it, while we all deep down wanted Edward and Bella together and not Bella and Jacob you still kinda rooted for Jacob. I personally loved Jacob in the series he had so much raw emotion wheter he was in complete anguish over Bella or he was as happy as a 3 yr old with can of coke. With the whole Jacob and Renesme story there is already conflict readily available from the Twilight series. First we have the fact that she's half vampire half human and he's a werewolf/shapeshifter (whatever you want to call him) Although neither family would attempt anything by hurting J or R there are still many other that don't exactly understand or agree with the relationship. Second, there is already a built in love triangle with the little Amazon boy (can't remember his name) who is also half vampire half human, and who has a great deal of interest in Renesme, and he is definately not going away if she were to continue on with the series. Third the conflict of the fact that the Volturi will continue to check on Renesme periodically and they still have a wounded ego from the last meeting with the Cullens. So with all that said I will be super super disapointed if that story isn't explored further, its just one of those things that you cannot not tell.
0446402389|4.0|I stopped reading this book after the first 80 pages or so because it felt like a million other detective books I have read in the past.  After months of being left on the shelf, and not being able to find something else to read, I decided to give it a second chance and I am so glad I did.  While it is not perfect, and some of the situations the characters are put in are far fetched, the story itself is very engrossing.  The characters are well developed and the history of Stalin's Russia is fascinating.  If you are looking for a fast and easy read, I would recommend this book.
B001GQ2TGA|5.0|It's been a while for a new release from Enya, and this collection with a winter/holiday theme is well worth the wait. It has the smooth, ethereal sound associated with Enya and in general focuses on a holiday theme. Most tracks have a winter/Christmas theme. The only track which does not seem to fit the holiday theme, at least in my view, is \\"My! My! Time Flies!\\" but it's a good track and I suppose does fit a New Year's Theme which would be both winter and holiday.<br /><br />For me, the two tracks which are outstanding would be her version of \\"O Come O Come Emmanuel\\" in both English and Latin and \\"Oiche Chiuin\\" (a Gaelic version of \\"Silent Night\\").\\"O Come O Come\\" has a haunting and beautiful sound to it but also has a sense of the longing the hymn is meant to evoke.  \\"Oiche Chiuin\\" shows that what could arguably be the best Christmas carol of all time has a universal beauty in its simplicity. The original tracks in the collection are similar to other releases: similar in originality, style, and quality. The tracks are a combination of instrumental only and instrumental and vocal and throughout the collection she remains true to her unique sound and stays clear from gimmicks, something easy to do with a Christmas collection.<br /><br />Enya devotees will love this new collection, but my guess is that it will have a crossover appeal as well. I know in my collection of Christmas music is varied--as I'm sure is the case of most people. This beautiful, relaxing winter/holiday collection can either sooth or relax or help a person gear up for the holidays.<br /><br />Enjoy!
B001EYGOEM|5.0|I had been anticipating the release of this album for a while and have not been dissapointed. Taylor Swift is a unique gem in the music world, her song writing ability is top notch along with the fact she also sings and plays guitar, especially when you consider the amount of people that call themselves musicians that can only barely manage the singing part. Taylor swift may not have the best voice or be the most fluid singer but thats what is so great about her, She is special in her own way and not afraid to be.     As far as the songs on the album go, They are all pretty strong. When the first album came out I didnt really like all of the songs on it but once i listened to them more they started to grow on me and I can tell that this is already happening this time around. Of course \\"love story\\" is an instant hit with such catchy lyrics, beat and such a fairytale like story that everyone can relate to wanting themselves. Then there's \\"The best day\\" which i can only imagine brought tears to her mom's eyes when she heard it, a personal story of how close she is to her family.    And of course there is the usual story or two about past relationships gone down the tubes such as \\"forever and always\\" which will inevitably become known to most people as that joe jonas song. The only bad thing about the album is the compression. All the dynamic's of the music have been squashed so much that it just doesnt let the real emotion and the strength's of taylor's beautiful voice to shine through. Most people wont notice this on their ipods and car stereo's but if they didnt try to be like everyone else and getting it as loud as possible it would have taken this album to another level.
B001F12J48|3.0|The red/blue 3-D system used here leaves much to be desired. There's a lot of ghosting (double imaging), particularly through the red filter, and few of the 3D images really \\"pop.\\" All red/blue systems have their problems, but they seems worse on this DVD. Those snow flakes that ought to be so real you can almost catch them on your tongue are a blur. The magenta/blue system used recently on the home 3-D edition of \\"Journey to the Center of the Earth\\" is much better and has much less ghosting. In all, \\"Polar Express 3-D\\" is a disappointment, especially if you saw \\"Polar Express\\" in IMAX 3-D a few years back or in several annual reissues.
0446579939|3.0|I am not one of those raving Nicholas Sparks fans that talk about how his books are the end all and be all of the modern romantic tale. At times, I find his books to be a bit corny and hokey and this one was really no exception. Unlike his earlier novels (The Notebook, Nights in Rodanthe, A Walk to Remember), this book just does not seem to have the same zing. In fact, it's almost more of a zud...lol.<br /><br />The story itself is told through the eyes of three main characters: Elizabeth, Thibault, and Clayton. All the characters are connected in different ways, and their actions with eachother are the true center of the story. At the beginning of the novel, we learn that Thibault is an Iraqi War Veteran, who has walked across the country looking for a woman he has never met. The woman is from a picture that he found half buried in the sand in Kuwait. Thibault views the picture as his \\"lucky charm,\\" saving him from death many times throughout the war.<br /><br />Thibault's first meeting with anyone his new town is with Clayton, a self centered, immature, ANNOYING cop from a famously rich family. It is easy to say that this character continually grated on my nerves. Every chapter that was from his point of view made me a bit queasy and I couldn't wait to finish them. Plus, he treats women as nothing more than sexual objects and that totally turned me off from his character.<br /><br />I don't want to give anymore of the plot away because it will ruin the story for those who want to read it. I'm not saying it was a bad story, it just wasn't Sparks' best and I found it to be a bit far fetched. Who honestly walks from Colorado to the Carolinas with a back pack and a dog? If I were to do it all over again, I would have waited for the MMPB to come out and saved myself some money.
B000GZI6VE|5.0|This is adorable and the laptop really opens and closes! Bought two one for adult and one for child. Cannot comment on the durability or educational value.  Who can resist a Smurf.
B0017IYWEE|5.0|It seems that with every new recording one discovers a new facet of this wonderful artist.  Her voice is gorgeous.  It has a bit more depth and darkish color that your usual coloratura soprano.  She isn't quite a dramatic coloratura soprano,  maybe a coloratura with some Spinto not lyric overtones.  You may well ask yourself why I'm taking the time to explore this unique sound of hers?  WELL!!!  Because of the color and size of her beautiful voice she can do many more roles that the average lyric-coloratura soprano can't. Besides having a great sound and technique, she is also a great vocal actress!  Also, live reviews tell us she is a great actress on stage.  Besides, a wonderful MITRIDATE aria we get an excellent MARTERN ALLER ARTEN.  We also get a rich voiced Countess from FIGARO and Donna Anna's NON MI DIR with stunning coloratura.  I also love her VORREI SPIEGARVI, OH DIO.  I fell in love with this aria because of Beverly Sills' wonderful recording of this aria.  Her coloratura is up there with the best and her interpretive skills right up there also.  Let's hope for many more wonderful recordings, DVDs, and performances from this great artist.<br />  The accompaniments are with LE CERCLE de L'HARMONIE conducted by Jeremie Rhorer.  Most of their work is excellent but maybe a little fast in VORREI SPIEGARVI.  It may take some listeners a few moments to adjust to period instruments for Mozart Operas especially the Flutes.  To my ear they come across a little out of tune.  However that just may be me.  In spite of this do not miss this great CD of great Mozart Arias performed by a new golden age Mozartian.  This Soprano has my highest respect and recommendation.  Try some of her recital CDS especially, the Salzburg Recital on ORFEO and her Mahler Recital.  She is an exceptional recitalist as well as a great singer of Opera!
B001GAPC1K|5.0|I loved the movie at the theatre and love the Blu-Ray version. Amazon's price was cheaper than the dvd version in stores around town. The image quality is awesome and I enjoyed the special features. It is a must have for any movie lovers collection.
B000MR9D5E|5.0|This is our second purchace of this item. We loved it so much we thought our grandchildren should also benefit from it and bought them a copy for christmas. It arrived as ordered.
B0001Z53MY|4.0|Great album and a treat to hear it in High Res surround.  The mixes (or the mastering) aren't as good as the originals but far more dynamic for the Res and surround.  I hope this formats survives the low res movement!
0321334876|5.0|Simply said:  this book is a `must' for any serious user of the language.  Wish I had this book when I was learning C++ (hopefully, more instructors alike would start recommending book like this to their students).  Once you have mastered the basic syntax, this book will give you a boost to your C++ knowledge.     Also recommend getting the sequel ' More Effective C++ ' by the same author and after that, ` Modern C++ Design' by Andrei Alexandrescu.
0061547840|5.0|Great book!  Trump is the ideal example of what America is all about.  Take advantage of your freedoms, and be as successful as you want to be.  He emphasizes taking responsibility for yourself, and not blaming him or her or whatever.  Be passionate about what you do, and strive to be the best at it.  He talks about his tiff with Rosie, and explains how to deal with \\"bullies\\" in your professional life.  One of the many things I love about Trump is that he says to be honest at all costs.  Yea, he is honest in the book too.  Being successful takes a lot of work and determination.  He also talks about a personal hero of mine, \\"Ronald Reagan.\\"  Overall this is a book about capitalism, from the ultimate capitalist.  He has gone from bankrupt, fought back, and came back twice as strong.  The man worked his azz off for what he has.  What this man must pay in taxes is ungodly, and wrong.  So if you want to read a book about how to be successful by YOURSELF, and be an individualist, read this book.  If you are happy plodding around waiting for the government to coddle you, do not bother reading, but buy it anyway because he deserves the kickback.  Somebody has to cover your food stamps.      Trump is a true American hero.
B000J10ERO|5.0|I couldn't find this DVD in Wal-Mart (believe that?), so I went on Amazon and found it for this great price (about $6.00) BRAND NEW! It works great.  I have no complaints at this time.
0446579939|5.0|For years Nicholas Sparks has been happily pumping out love stories on a yearly basis.  His body of work has made him one of the most recognizable authors out there.  The Lucky One is one of his better books in a while and shows just how Nicholas Sparks has grown as a writer.  Fans of his work will enjoy it save for a few slight hitches.<br /><br />The Lucky One focuses on Logan Thibault.  While serving in Iraq he comes across a photo of a beautiful woman.  As soon as that happens his luck begins to change.  In moments where he should've died he lives.  In the poker games he has with his buddies he's suddenly winning.  Things turn in his favor.  His friend comes to the conclusion that the photo must give him luck.  After he's done serving in Iraq, he eventually decides to find this woman.  His search leads him to North Carolina where he meets the woman in the photo.  A woman named Elizabeth.  The love that blossoms isn't without its own little secrets and dangers, however, and Logan and Elizabeth will both discover that.<br /><br />One of the things Nicholas Sparks has been able to do really well is create good characters.  The characters really come into their own and show their personalities.  Sparks does a great job because each chapter is from a different point of view.  This makes it easier to get to know the main characters throughout the novel.  Each chapter begins with a number and the name of the character whose eyes we are seeing through.  This lets the focus really narrow in on character thoughts and motivations.  It brings the characters to life a lot more.<br /><br />The story is also fairly well paced, each and everything falling into place rather well.  If there was anything bothersome about the story it would be the book's final moments.  After such an intense build up the final moments fly by in a flash.  There's nothing wrong with a swift climax.  It's how it all comes together that makes little sense.  The final chapter, and the epilogue might take a reread just to make sure you didn't miss anything.<br /><br />It doesn't stop The Lucky One from being a great read.  It keeps up the momentum for the most part.  While the ending doesn't fall flat, it's hard not to desire a little more after such a strong build up given the actions of the characters throughout.<br /><br />The Lucky One is a good novel with lovable characters and a well paced story.  It is among Sparks best books, even if it isn't one that'll drive you to tears.e sure you didn't miss anything.      It doesn't stop The Lucky One from being a great read.

B001EO2UJK|5.0|I can finally dispose of one of my bootleg DVD's of early 'live' Genesis performances...although the catalog CD catalog was remastered on Atlantic/Atco in the 90's, TRESPASS was only available on import & VERY difficult to obtain..some snafu/licensing deal with MCA made this a tough item to buy...so this new upgrade of TRESPASS is a welcome addition in itself...also wish this box contained the Genesis 'LIVE' lp containing the missing trax not issued on the lp...I'm thrilled to see that they have included the original slides that were projected on the 'Lamb' tour...if you were there 34 years ago, you know what I mean...some fans might have seen this slide presentation in the past few years if they attended a performance of \\"The Musical Box\\"...the Canadian outfit who were fortunate enough to obtain the original slides from PG for their world tours of TLLDOB...my major complaint was not to be offered the CD's in SACD like the import box set...buying the import would not allow me to play the DVD's..PAL vs. NTSC...a great box for early Genesis fans..no doubt...and I highly recommend the detailed 'unofficial' companion book by Robin Platts..Genesis..Behind the Lines..1967-2007...cool early photos on my website....Peter Stupar, San Francisco
B000HGA5PM|3.0|Worth having if you're a fan. Come on! its a live 1980 show, when Rick Wright (RIP) was on his way out!!<br /><br />Sadly the Final Cut followed, which basically killed the band<br /><br />The Wall was the last legitimate Gilmour/Waters collaboration. The Final Cut could easily have been a Waters solo album, barring the odd guitar solo on Fletcher Memorial Home!
B0017ZB8M6|3.0|Katy Perry is a great singer and has the right idea with her songs. However, the musical aspect of the other tunes besides the two radio hits kind of misses the mark. Such a shame for a talented person such as she.
B001AIRUOU|5.0|NBX is a modern classic. It's a great story about Halloween taking over Christmas. The characters are great, there's pathos and comedy and lots of fun for kids 10 and up. This version isn't very different from the laserdisk version which came out years ago. From the commercial I thought there might be some cgi goodies added or the new 3d cgi movie that was shown in theatres two halloweens or so ago. It's great for what it is, but I expected additional extras more than the download copy for Ipods, etc.
B0011HOEY4|4.0|This review is written by Mr. Bradberry's students:                    American gangster        American gangster is based on a true story of a murdering drug pusher and crooked cops.   Frank Lucas was a drug dealer that ship over 1kilo of heroin for Vietnam to the US. While the Vietnam War was still intact. Over a year has pass Frank Lucas was a well know drug dealer around all New York.  His biggest idol was named bumpy. He was a person who ran the Harlem streets and all so another drug dealer. When bumpy dies Lucas want inherits the fresh cut heroin from the Far East to New York City streets than he will become the king pin of all drug dealer.  American Gangster is one of your favorite movies out because it's filled with action, drama. The character that played Frank Lucas in the movie was really (Denzel Washington). Also Richie Roberts a detective was (Russell Crowe). The way that the cops were corrupted was the way he smuggled drugs in New York City and all while the Great Depression was going on. When you watch it you will probably think it's the best movie. Richie Roberts wasn't a corrupted cop like most of the others cops.   Russell Crowe was also in the movie Gladiator, in my opinion this was an awesome movie. Frank Lucas was not well know until he started selling drugs then he got front row seats to a boxing match between Muhammad Ali VS. Joe Frazier. This was suspicious because he Richie Roberts saw that he got better seats than this well know rich guy. Frank Lucas also knows the well know stars, which Richie never thought he would meet or even know. Frank Lucas was \\"The Boss\\", the inventor of the Blue Magic Empire.   The way they put the movie together was amazing, and the story plot comes slowly. Slowly unfolds, while there is less shooting and action than you think there will be.   So American Gangster is a good movie and I suggest you buy it or rent it. It has history, and I recommend you see it either the theatrical version or the un-rated version. One of my favorite movies ever made and should see it.
1416562605|1.0|I read the book in one day and I didn't like it at all. Completely artificial and fake. I thought may be I am the only one who didn't like the book but when I searched the internet, I found many articles criticizing Arvind Adiga. He is no different than Arundhati Roy who thinks that she can interfere in every national issue just because she won booker prize. Ask few literate Indian people and you will know what do they think about Arvind and Arundhati. This article comes from a famous respected journalist and a known blogger from a reputed news channel which is a branch of CNN in India. Here is the article.<br /><br />I must confess or admit that I was wrong! When Aravind Adiga got the Man Booker prize for his White Tiger, I was one of the millions of Kannadigas who felt extremely happy and proud about the remarkable achievement of a fellow 'KannAdiga' at the international literary scene.<br /><br />It was a very proud and emotional moment for the book lovers like me.<br /><br />Aravind Adiga is not the first international writer from Karnataka. In fact two of world's best English writers of the 20th century, Rajarao and R K Narayan are also from Karnataka.<br /><br />Later a literary genius A K Ramanujan held Kannada and Karnataka flag very high in the West.<br /><br />Adiga could be the fourth writer from Karnataka, who has made name in the west with his debut novel.<br /><br />Unlike these great writers from his home state, Adiga just plays to the Western gallery.<br /><br />In his desperation or eagerness to please the white people, he presents nothing new about India to Europe and America.<br /><br />I finished reading White Tiger in just one day.<br /><br />My enthusiasm evaporated quicker than a punctured balloon. One can read it just because it got the Man Booker prize, not because of its literary value or weight.<br /><br />Like the other Booker Indians, Adiga too tries to show a degraded India to the West to market his name and novel.<br /><br />As a US based writer and critic Amitava Kumar writes (The Hindu) \\"for a novel that is supposed to be a portrait of the 'real' India, The White Tiger comes across as curiously inauthentic. Is it a novel from one more outsider, presenting cynical anthropologies to an audience that is not Indian\\".<br /><br />The same thought came to my mind after I put the novel down.<br /><br />Adiga is not different from Rushdie, Roy, Mishra and others who thrive by selling India's negative side to the cynical west.<br /><br />The 321-page novel looks artificial from the very beginning.<br /><br />Adiga who worked as a business journalist with Time magazine in India knows what sells the best in Europe and America.<br /><br />The narrator of the novel Balram Halwai says in one of the opening pages, \\"Mr. Jiabao is on a mission. He wants to know the truth about Bangalore. My blood froze. If anyone knows the truth about Bangalore, it's me.\\"<br /><br />The novel is full of such carefully written words (not spontaneous!). I know Bangalore and Karnataka (may be even India) better than Adiga.<br /><br />But, I can't relate myself to Adiga's Bangalore or India, though he claims that he is telling an authentic story of globalisation.<br /><br />Adiga's hero Balram Halwai tells the story of his fellow, less-privileged poor villagers living in one of the wretched villages on the Bihar - Jharkhand border. One doesn't need to read the entire novel to understand Adiga's shallow and superficial understanding of India.<br /><br />Stop reading on page number 10 or 15 or may be 55. You will surely find on almost every page something that sounds false or artificial.<br /><br />The White Tiger has everything about India that western readers lap up. Look at his description of India's gods and beliefs.<br /><br />\\"I guess, Your Excellency, that I too should start off by kissing some god's arse. Which god's arse, though? There are so many choices. See, the Muslims have one god. The Christians have three gods. And weHindus have 36,000,000 gods. Making a grand total of 36,000,0004 divine arses for me to choose from\\".<br /><br />Nothing unsual. Nothing new in it. Almost every Indian writer who seeks the blessings of Western 'gods' to survive in the dog eat dog world of writers, writes such lines. (Please don't call me a Hindu fanatic!).<br /><br />Like Adiga, I too don't care much about our gods and goddesses.<br /><br />But, Adiga has cleverly packaged our 36 crores gods with India's IT revolution and the head of our mighty neighbour, China to make his novel more attractive and saleable.<br /><br />He knows he can no longer sell just gods. It has to be packaged well with IT, management etc! Adiga must understand that majority of Indians prefer to 'kiss the arses of 36 crore plus local gods'. People like Adiga and his ilk religiously 'licks and kisses the arses' of the white people.<br /><br />Adiga looks very cheap when he tries to present a stereotypical image of Muslims. Read this description.<br /><br />\\"By the way, Mr Premier, have you noticed that all four of the greatest poets in the world are Muslim? And yet all the Muslims you meet are illiterate or covered head to toe in black burkas or looking for buildings to blow up? It's a puzzle, isn't it? If you ever figure these people out, send me an e-mail.\\"<br /><br />I am sure he is not ignorant. But, he knows his western readers don't want to read about enlightened, educated, liberal Muslims from the East.<br /><br />Adiga's protagonist Balram Halwai doesn't want to talk about the success of Muslim entrepreneurs like Azim Premji at the international level or APJ Abdul Kalam, former President of India, a known scientist and an extremely reputed personality all over the world  or famour trio of Khans in bollywood or even other Muslims who own half the shops and buildings on up market MG road and Commercial Streets in Bangalore. Because, good and successful people from the East (be it a Hindu or a Muslim) don't sell in the west!<br /><br />As Amitava Kumar writes, \\"Adiga's villains are utterly cartoonish, like the characters in a bad Bollywood melodrama. However, it was his presentation of ordinary people that I found not only trite but also offensive.\\"<br /><br />His description of villains and feudal class of UP and Bihar is exactly the same as their description in a low budget Hindi or Bhojpuri movie. Even his comments on Bangaloreans (he claims that he knows the city best!) are derogatory and full of sarcasm.<br /><br />Adiga skillfully and cleverly builds his novel, keeping western awards and rewards in his mind. He is pretentious, untrue and artificial in every page.<br /><br />For me, the only small consolation is The White Tiger is a piece of fiction, not a history book like one of his runners up at the Man Booker, viz. Amitava Ghosh's The Sea of Poppies!<br /><br />My dear KannAdiga, if anybody knows Bangalore and India the best, it is people like me, not people like you (I am using your own words!).<br /><br />You people hate everything positive about India. We are tired of stereotypical presentation of India by the 'award centric', 'west obsessed' writers like you.<br /><br />Before reading The White Tiger, I wanted to read Adiga's second novel Between the Assassinations.<br /><br />I am no longer interested in reading one more piece of disappointing text.<br /><br />But, I want to read his articles on India. They are very good! Sadly, he has given up journalism and taken up writing of fiction based on 'facts' and his 'study' of India.<br /><br />I hope, I pray and I believe that one day, during my own lifetime some Indian will write what is good about India or at least what is real about India and will win the Man Booker.<br /><br />May be a Nobel Award.<br /><br />I will wait. Hope will never die. India's time will come.<br /><br />Thanks
B000GG4KTU|5.0|Diana Krall is amazing. Her voice is smooth and sultry, her technical abilities on piano surpass most female jazzers out there, and her groove with the different groups she performs with is always in the pocket. Pick up this album NOW if you haven't!! You won't be disappointed.
B001DTPZNY|2.0|I like most have been a Indy fan from the beginning.  Most of his subsequent films in this series did not hold up to the impact of the first.  However, this last offering is such a disappointment it was hardly worth your time viewing the movie.  Obviously the magic is over!
0375826726|4.0|If you like fantasy, this series is great.  Paolini does a wonderful job continuing the story in Brisingr.  Obviously, if you like the first two, you have to read this one.
B001990LIW|5.0|One of the all time best movies ever.  Joss Whedon is an excellent writer and director.  What really puts this movie above the rest is the number of times you can watch it, this is one of the few movies you can watch over and over again and be satisfied.

B001FBJULI|1.0|The MUSIC on these New Order reissues get a 5/5, easily.  However, there were far too many egregious mistakes made in the creation of the discs themselves to give them a pass.  Only the first discs were re-mastered though they still have some problems, it is the bonus discs that are an absolute mess.    Warner Music/Rhino know about these problems, but there is yet no word on any forthcoming fixes.  So I'd hold off until these issues are addressed.    Noted below are the specific problems with the PC&L reissue:    1, Age of consent  2, We all stand  3, The village  4, 586 (\\"abrupt ending\\", \\"drops the last 4 bass notes\\")  5, Your silent face  6, Ultraviolence  7, Ecstasy  8, Leave me alone    Power, Corruption and Lies - bonus disc:  1, Blue Monday (L/R pans 0:07[sudden], and between 0:19 and 2:24. At 2:24 it pans back again. Unconfirmed whether this is on the original 12 inch)  2, The Beach  3, Confusion - Clicks at 4:04 and 6:00 (Left channel click at 8:06)  4, Thieves like us  5, Lonesome Tonight (clicks at 0:40 and 0:59)  6, Murder - \\"Clicks\\" at 0:35, 1:08, 1:29, 1:43, 2:03, 2:31, 2:43, 2:50, 3:00, 3:19, 3:26  7, Thieves like us (instrumental) (click at 1:03 )  8, Confusion (instrumental)
B001F7MSFM|4.0|Who said that sequels are necessarily worse than the first films?<br /><br />In the case of Hellboy, \\"The Golden Army\\", is far superior film to Del Toro's first Hellboy film.  Steering away from the convoluted plot that marked the first film, Toro took note of the comments he received from fans and clarified the new film and layered the presentation with symbolism, iconic use in scenery and visual allusion.  The result is a product that not only includes philosophic commentary on the human condition (such has characterized the comic books since their inception), and Red's wry sense of humor.<br /><br />Del Toro has infused \\"Golden Army\\" with a life that leaps off the DVD and the big screen (if you saw it there).  Just don't look at the surface however, look for touches like the faeires from Pan's Labrynith in jars at the US Bureau for Paranormal Research.<br /><br />As one good friend of mine said, don't judge the Hellboy films by their name.  Behind the films are a good example of how successful franchises work.  During an interview with Mike Mignola, we discussed the reasons his films are successful and said that good storytelling was integral to any successful film.  This is good storytelling at a variety of levels.  Good vs evil, redemption vs judgement, and other strong themes can be found in these films.  Del Toro is no slouch.<br /><br />The DVD is packed with extras like set visits, a personalized Troll Market, an animated comic book epilogue.  Truly the next best thing to sitting at a comic con jawing with Ron Perlman, Doug Jones, and Selma Blair.<br /><br />Until Red starts selling Avon....beware Hellboy.<br /><br />Tim Lasiuta
B00192KCQ0|5.0|back in 2003 when st. anger came out alot of people thought that metallica was going to come back. there was speculation from the band that they were using ride the lightning as a template for the album, that brought high hopes amongst fans. when i listented to the album and i even wrote a review of it and even gave it 4 stars ( why i did is beyond me). but after listening to the album for a while.. it wasn't at all that great. yeah..they went back to their metallic roots with the heavy riffs and blast beat drumming, but the music wasn't at all tight. it was too repetitive and at times sounded like more of a hardcore band. the production and sound wasn't at all that great and after watching the some kind of monster dvd you can see why st. anger came out the way it did. the band wasn't together....until now    in may of 2003 after the recording of st. anger they hire robert trujillo (suicidal tendencies) in whom has revitalized the band in many ways you can imagine. after going through the loss of cliff burton and then going through a hasty split with jason newstand they needed someone like robert. when i heard back in may of 2007 that rick rubin was going to produce the new album..all but high hopes filled my soul for this band. i just knew right then and there that they were going to come back....and boy did they come back with a vengence! this album is tight from start to finish. nothing but old school thrash metal with a little pinch of the hard rocking metallica we got back in 1991 through 1997. the guitars are loud and distorted and haven't heard james and kirk thrash out like this since 1988. robert trujillo does a great job with the bass duties meanwhile lars ulrich plays the drums very aggressively on this album. you gotta hand it to rick rubin man, if you thought his production did not help..you're dead wrong. go figure..the man produced one of the best metal album of all time (slayer's reign in blood). i had read an interview on metallica on making this album and they said that when the band and rubin sat down to discuss the pre production..rubin had said to go back to the master of puppets days. although many people argue that the sound isn't as good as past releases, it isn't bad. its loud and upfront and coming from me and audio engineer..i think its great. the only complaint i have is that the bass could have sounded a little better. none the less...excellent album. i would compare this album to and justice for all.
0786838655|4.0|Like many of the books I wind up falling in love with, I stumbled upon The Lightning Thief by accident.  I was wandering around Border's and found this gem on a table with signs saying \\"If you liked Harry Potter, then you might like these...\\"  They were right.<br /><br />The concept of the famous gods from ancient mythology still existing and following the path of Western Civilization across the world is genious.  And the demigod characters who star in this new series are wonderful!  I found myself wishing that I was a member of Camp Halfblood and wondering which cabin I'd be a part of myself.  (After careful consideration, I decided I'm clearly a child of Athena.)<br /><br />One other thing that was really exciting for me when reading this novel was the almost complete accuracy surrounding the old Greek myths.  I was a Classics minor in college, so I'm a stickler for detail when it comes to getting those stories right.  Mr. Riordan REALLY succeeded and that's not something I can honestly say I've ever found before.
B001F290E4|1.0|You have to wonder if Seals's newfound supermodel lifestyle, hunkered down with Heidi Klum and a baby, has terminally impacted his ability to produce worthwhile music. His last release, \\"System\\", was a mediocre affair, and this new record continues the nose dive. Seal, bubela, you're supposed to make a covers record when your career is on the wane, like Rod Stewart or Michael McDonald. When all your fans are OLD, don't buy records or see shows anymore, when life puts you alongside them in the middle of the road, afraid to take chances or hear anything new. You DON'T make this kind of record when you're young and still somewhat hip.<br /><br />David Foster is a really bad choice as a producer - this is a guy who makes schmaltzy, overproduced, MOR records. Seal did his best work with Trevor Horn, and the more records he makes without Horn, the more it seems obvious that most of what made Seal cool was Trevor Horn's production.
B00005JKEZ|5.0|As opposed to the profane, dark, cruel anti-heroes of today, Errol Flynn smiles and laughs as he duels with the evil Sir Guy! Witty, humorous, charming and delightful. Action scenes are marvelously choreographed. The colors are brilliant and the action is fun (as opposed to being a showcase for special effects where blood splatters &#34;realistically&#34;). Ah, the good old days!
B0016A2FFG|5.0|Al Green is a singer extraordinaire and, though I was not living when he was in his heyday, I'm glad he released \\"Lay it Down\\", because it sounds a lot like his classics such as \\"Love and Happiness\\" and \\"Let's Stay Together.\\"  \\"Lay it Down\\" has that classic 1970s feel; I can't believe he pulled this off so effectively.  I say this because he sounds exactly how he did in the 60s and 70s! It's simply a wonderful listening experience, namely for the older crowd.  It's hard to believe this album was released in 2008, but it was, and it is easily one of the best albums of '08.<br /><br /> Some of music's most talented artists join Green on this album.  I was pleasantly surprised to hear Anthony Hamilton, John Legend and Corrine Bailey Rae assisting Green on this album.  Each artist did a stupendous job and added flavor to the album.  The song which features Corrine Bailey Rae, \\"Take Your Time\\" is simply magical.  She is the only female guest appearance, and because of that, this track stands out.  She and Green sound beautiful coupled together.  \\"Take Your Time\\" is one of this album's finest moments.  When I first heard the title track, I immediately added it to my iPod because I knew I wanted to hear it again and again.  The title track truly sets the tone for the rest of the album.  Al Green has never sounded better.  Also, the lyrics are clever and the bass is amazing!  \\"No One Like You\\" is another standout with great bass.  Some would argue that many of these songs sound the same, especially production-wise.  For example, \\"No One Like You\\" sounds like \\"Stay With Me\\" (By the Sea.)  Normally I have a problem with songs sounding the same as far as production, but, for some reason, it's alright on this album, maybe because it's such a fine work collectively.<br /><br /> You all need to add this album to your collection.  I see why Al Green was so popular in the 60s and 70s because his music is nothing but the truth!  Relax, take a load off, and let the mellow sounds of Al Green take you away!  5 shining stars!<br /><br />Mikeisha's Top 5<br /><br />1. \\"Lay it Down\\"<br />2. \\"Take Your Time\\"<br />3. \\"No One Like You\\"<br />4. \\"Just for Me\\"<br />5. \\"Too Much\\"e you away!  5 shining stars!

B0013ND30W|3.0|\\"Sleeping Beauty\\" isn't a very warm or emotionally engaging film, and those of us who love it do so because of its extraordinary design artistry (largely due to the participation of artist Eyvind Earle). The film's use of color is central to its artistic integrity, but those who have digitally remastered \\"Sleeping Beauty\\" for this Blu-Ray edition have played havoc with its original palette. Scores of Disney artists labored for years to put \\"Sleeping Beauty\\" on the screen, but a few keyboard-pounding technicians with no obvious artistic credentials have marred its color scheme and spoiled one of its key charms. If all you want is the visual sweep, the sharp clarity, and (heaven help you) the story of \\"Sleeping Beauty,\\" then this version will serve; if you want the carefully chosen colors that bathed the screen in its original Super Technirama 70/Technicolor release, then you'll be sadly disappointed.
0060899190|5.0|What do you get someone that has everything and can get anything? This book. I got it for my sister who buys whatever she wants (within reason of course) and so when she got this book for xmas last year, she couldnt put it down. This year I am following it up with the book's sequel and I know she'll love it!<br /><br />I know some reviews were disappointed because the book was mostly just ones from the web site, but for someone that has never seen the web site... its perfect.
B001ESYAJY|4.0|I'm surprised to see how the soundtrack for Quantum of Solace (QOS) is rated very low by some here at Amazon. For those who have already seen the movie, I'm sure you would have heard how brilliant the score was for QOS during certain scenes in the movie. It deserves better ratings. I have the soundtrack, and after hearing it play on my player, it just brings me back to the scenes from the movie. There are subtle tunes of the James Bond theme in some of the score and that's what I like about the soundtrack this time around which was lacking in the excellent Casino Royale soundtrack. A couple of my favorites score on the soundtrack is Time To Get Out and Night At The Opera.. A must have for those who enjoyed the movie and a must have for James Bond fans, naturally..
1402713185|4.0|My son was 6 when we picked this book up.  We read together as a family in the evening.  I like to introduce him to the classics when I can.  Some of them, like Treasure Island or the Three Muskateers are either too long for him to sit through or too graphic.<br /><br />This is probably for the 9 to 12 year old reading ability.<br />This is an abridged version of Treasure Island, the main part of the story is still there.  Now to someone who may have already read Treasure Island, you may feel the book is missing its heart.<br /><br />To my 6 year old this book was enthralling.  He found the original on my book shelf and moved it into his room for when he gets older.<br /><br />We have a number of the Classic Starts books, I prefer them to some of the other children aimed classics.  There are simple illustrations throughout the book.
B000VBJEFK|5.0|\\"Ratatouille\\" is a masterpiece, plain and simple. Not even the presence of the mouth-foaming half-wit Janeane Garofalo can spoil it, and that's saying something. But the addition of Blu-Ray to the home experience of \\"Ratatouille\\" can only enhance it, and does. I give this disc my highest recommendation.

B000MGUZM0|5.0|Neon Bible, produced by Arcade Fire, resonates with its profound lyrics.  I particularly enjoyed the various musical instruments that accompanied the large band, and how the instruments, such as the pipe organ, contributes to the mood and theme the band is attempting to convey.  The themes expressed in the songs reflect issues that are prevalent in society today, such as the impersonal nature of a materialistic lifestyle and the hypocritical nature of figures in authority.      In a musical environment brimming with shallow and syrupy pop songs, it is incredibly refreshing to hear music that deals with issues that are more important than the typical teen romance.  I can sense that the songs were derived with legitimate emotion and concern for the impending society.  Although the themes are for the most part dark, they strike me as very real, with the metaphors and imagery illustrating messages that everyone involved in societal issues can relate to.    If you are looking for cd produced for merely commercial benefits, then do not purchase or listen to this cd.  This work of art is meant for deep thinkers, who enjoy musical talent accompanied by soulful lyrics.  The unification of this band, which consists of many members led by Win Butler, is striking.  Neon Bible is an indie production that is sure to please music lovers looking to be enlightened and inspired.
0321356683|5.0|Did you realize that enums can implement interfaces? That the simplest safe way to implement a singleton is using an enum? That it's possible to obtain an object reference to a private member using serialization? There are lots of ways to learn the language basics and figure out how to use the libraries. But nowhere do you have such a dense collection of non-obvious, yet important issues that any Java developer ought to be aware of. The book is written from the perspective of someone who creates public APIs, so there is a lot of obsessing over how to prevent users from doing things they shouldn't (intentionally, or not). But even if that's not a big concern for you, it's nevertheless important to be aware of the issues. Having read the first edition a while back, reading the second edition was more that a good refresher -- it's almost a different book. This is in part thanks to Java 5, which has made a lot of the original items (e.g. how create enumerations) obsolete, while introducing the need for a whole new set of items (e.g. regarding the use of generics).
B000W8OM5Y|4.0|Notwithstanding historical inaccuracies (and there are many), this was great entertainment.  I usually watch a DVD at home over the course of 2-3 nights, but I could not turn this one off, and watched the whole thing (nearly 3 hours) in one sitting.  Such a great story and wonderful acting, scenery, etc.
B0000AQS0F|5.0|I'm not really sure why I didn't hear about these Firefly series until this year. I'm kinda upset I didn't get to support this awesome series back when it first came out.<br /><br />After watching the first episode, I instantly fell in love with everything from the characters to the story itself.  I just can't believe this series got cancelled.  I love the cast, every single one of them fit in well and have their own unique roles.  Each episodes have a beginning and an end, leaving you satisfied each and every episode.<br /><br />And finally, it's a sci-fi series for those of us that have grew out of Star Wars genre, but not quite old enough to enjoy Star Strek.  I love the adult humor in Firefly, it's mature and refreshing.  Each episode makes me LOL. I've personally always found Star Wars to be a tad kiddish & cheesey at times, while Star Trek to be a tad slow & boring.  Firefly keeps me interested, laughing, and it has plenty of action.<br /><br />Anyways, I highly recommend this to any sci-fi fans.  I can only hope there will be more in the future, as I've already grown attached to the cast of this series.  Both my g/f and I are sad when we finished the last DVD and realized there are no more.  Please, someone, pick this up and let it keep going.
B001GKJ2E8|3.0|Going into watching this, I was expecting a popcorn movie: nothing deep but fun. I must say, the first half of this movie was as entertaining as I've ever seen Lots of great action, f/x, shots, and dialouge.<br />Once the second half kicks in, it starts to run out of gas. It doesn't offer anything new and it starts to get repetitive. I guess they couldn't keep up the intensity from the first half.<br />Overall, a pretty good movie that could of been better. Worth a rent.<br />On a final note, Angelina Jolie looks rail thin here. Give that woman something to eat.
B000AY807Q|1.0|If Neil had cranked out album's like this throughout his career his name would be linked with lesser singer-songwriters like James Taylor and Jackson Browne instead of Bob Dylan.  I know what you are thinking, \\"But he has done albums like this before!  What about Harvest, Harvest Moon and Silver and Gold?!?!\\".  Sorry, but Prairie Wind is a pale imitation of those albums.    The songwriting is weak and the arrangements are often saccharine and overbearing.  I can honestly say that I enjoy \\"Landing on Water\\", \\"Arc\\" and \\"Are You Passionate?\\" much more than this album.  At least LOW had \\"Hippie Dream\\", Arc took guts and AYP? had a great guitar tone.  Prairie Wind just mocks all the good work Neil did wiith an acoustic guitar.     If you are a collector it is a must but if you like good Neil Young music pass on this one and get the other acoustic albums.
B00005221M|5.0|I never watched this when it came out in the early 90's, but had heard about it.  It was wonderfully done, Daniel Day-Lewis was mesmerizing, and I was struck at how it did not feel the least bit dated.  I did not read the book, so can't compare, but for a movie, this had much \\"edge of your seat\\" action, romance (not overdone or oversexual), and beauty.  And yes, DDL running through the woods makes for some rewinding and replaying!

B001GM28HO|4.0|The first track and single from Lady Gaga's THE FAME demands that we \\"Just Dance\\".  And lest you think the dancing stops at track one, you'd be sorely mistaken.  In fact, THE FAME is one of those rare pop jewels too rarely released by the majors--a pop record that aspires to be nothing but that(it's what Gwen Stefani would sound like doing a whole record of New Wave filtered through an electropop lense instead of the schizophrenic smorgasbord that she continues to cling to). As such, the electropop current running through \\"Just Dance\\" is stamped all over the record; other choice cuts include, but are not limited too, \\"Poker Face\\", \\"Boys Boys Boys\\", and \\"Love Game\\". And the singer wisely stays the dance route for much of the album; the set's one detour into anything-resembling-a-ballad territory, \\"Brown Eyes\\", is really the record's closest thing to a dud track.  Overall, one of the year's most endearing pop efforts.
1416562605|4.0|I came to a conflict when it came time for me to review The White Tiger. It truly is an excellent book, almost bordering on a masterpiece. And just like any masterpiece it is deeply flawed, some of the characters are not fully developed and at times the dialogue is rigid. But the overall narration and tone of this book is jaw-droppingly amazing.     Adiga's narration of a man trying to overcome the class system and social makeups of a society is relatable on any level and that is where the story gets is push from. It's an unsentimental view of India that Adiga paints that sticks with the reader. So many things are thrown at the reader and so many questions of a changing society, religious upheaval, contempt over money/education any numerous other problems that at times  you just have to take a step back and marvel at the utter clarity and precision that Adiga's work has -- not to mention it's his first!    It's a definite read.
1423113497|5.0|I am 50+ and loved these books as much as my 8 yr old niece. Who would've thought a current day preteen could be faced with dealing with ancient Greek mythological gods?!? And to be enthralling reading to boot! This is not at all like Harry Potter; BUT, if you enjoy HP, you'll enjoy Percy Jackson. It helps to be familiar with Greek mythology before reading about Percy; but you can definitely learn as you go without feeling like you are.  Pick it up, start reading and I bet you will not want to stop!
0684865130|5.0|First and foremost, Catch-22 is written in a circular fashion, often ignoring chronological order to aid in the atmosphere of apparent logical irrationality.  Many a reader has been turned away by this lack of sensical ordering.  However strive on, just as a CSI detective starts with only half the picture, as you travel through this book, all becomes clear.    There are two different appeals to reading Catch-22.  The first is the lighthearted satire, mayhaps similar to what many of us have found in the comic strip \\"Beetle Bailey\\".  In fact, you could open this book up randomly to any page and sample the hilarity without embroiling yourself in an immense and thought-provoking novel.      The other path is the hidden meaning which each and every one of the 50 odd characters portrays.  The profound absurdity of war and the needs of the individual versus the needs of society are debated mercilessly.  This book is not truly anti-war as the war itself often seems more of a backdrop to the main story, however Heller strives to emphasize the desires of the individual versus the greater payoff to society .  The main character, Yossarian, desires the end of the WWII but not at the cost of his own life.  The greater enemy of the novel is often not the Germans, but the bureaucracy of the American army or as Yossarian says, \\"The enemy is anybody who's going to get you killed, no matter which side he's on, and that includes Colonel Cathcart. And don't you forget that, because the longer you remember it, the longer you might live.\\"
B000LPQ6DE|5.0|I adored this film.  It brought the book to life and though it did make some changes to Bronte's novel, they were good and reasonable ones.  I loved the acting and the costuming, both were very true to the book. I want to watch it again and again! Truly a classic that's worth buying!!
0811826848|4.0|If you are a Beatles fan who enjoys reading about them (and not just listening) then you have to own this book.  It is the story of the Beatles from their own lips.  Is it the definitive Beatles book?  Well, the Beatles have a vested interest in preserving their legacy so are we getting the true picture?  And Lennon's absence--he's represented as well as possible--slants the overall balance to McCartney. It has more detail than the video anthology which glosses over the break up and many other details. But the Anthology book should be read as one of several crucial Beatles books mentioned in many other reviews. My favorites are the Peter Brown book, Richard DiLello's \\"The Longest Cocktail Party\\" (as much about Apple as the Beatles but a hoot!) and Nicholas Schaffner's \\"Beatles Forever\\", still my favorite after all these years.  The Anthology is not the only Beatles book to own.
B001F290E4|2.0|It's troubling to me that I have to give a Seal cd only 2 stars, and even that is generous. It's Seal's powerful voice that earns the stars, as this cd falls flat in almost every possible way.    I own every Seal cd, and love each of them in their own ways (even the under-performing Human Being and System). This cd, however, is just horrible. It begins with perhaps the only palatable track this disc holds, \\"A Change is Gonna Come.\\" Unlike many of the songs, it at least seems there's a little emotion evoked through this song, and that's probably why it's the first (only?) single to come out of the cd.    Everything else, however, is lackluster. Gone is the heartfelt and soaring melodies that Seal is so well known for. No track bears that \\"Seal\\" stamp, none conveys anything more than a need to get through all the lyrics. You won't feel goosebumps, much less any sort of interest. It's actually painful to play this cd all the way through... trust me, I tried a couple times over, and was more saddened with each play-through.    In all, I am highly, highly disappointed. Given the decent quality of the title track, I thought the whole cd might rise above a typical \\"covers\\" album and afford us Seal's take on some soul classics. Unfortunately, it's all just lifeless performances of some classic numbers.
B001EYGOEM|5.0|Taylor Swift has been one of my favorite artists since her debut with \\"Tim McGraw,\\" but she just keeps getting better! She's really come into her own in this album as she approaches life not just as a teenager but as a young adult. This is an excerpt of a bulletin that Taylor posted on myspace the night before the cd release & i think it really perfectly sums up her album:<br /><br />\\"I've been wanting you to hear these new songs since the very moment of their creation. Every single song has a face attached. They're all about people. Some even mention names. But most importantly, these songs tell my stories.<br /><br />These songs tell the story of my freshmen year of high school, and the day I met Abigail. They tell the story of the guy who apologized over and over again without ever meaning it. The story about saying goodbye to someone when you don't want to, because you can't breathe without them. The story of the boy who never realized he was with the wrong girl, and that the right one was right there in front of him. The story of my childhood, and the moment I realized my mom was the best friend I'll ever have. The memories of running and laughing and having the best days with her.<br /><br />These songs tell stories about fairytale romances, and how sometimes they don't work out the way you dream about when you're a little girl. Because when we're young, we dream about Romeo and Prince Charming-- and we hope he'll ride up on a white horse and rescue us. But sometimes the white horse shows up too late, after the prince has already let you down and left your dreams out in the rain. I never read a fairy tale with that ending. I guess that's the hard part about living in reality.<br /><br />One song tells the story of the underdogs who spent every day dreaming about the day they'd see things change, and the story of the night things finally.... did. And they sang hallelujah. There's the story of the first date that's so magical, you want to dance around the parking lot in the rain. In your best dress. There's the tragic story of the boy who walked away--because he found some other girl to promise forever to. Then there's the love story about how it can all actually work out perfectly and wonderfully. And how love really CAN be everything we dream about. About how someday, we all just might find the one that will kneel to the ground and pull out a ring and say \\"Marry me, Juliet. You never have to be alone. I love you and that's all I really know.\\"<br /><br />And maybe that's wishful thinking. But maybe... that's just being fearless.<br />;)\\"<br /><br />Taylor truly is a gift. Both musically and as a young woman who allows you to see the depths of her heart. She's genuine, she's kind, she's raw, she's grounded, & she truly loves and appreciates her fans. I hope that it's something that she holds onto, but I don't see anything like that changing about her. She's real. It's what makes people love her. It's why her songs sell. She writes from her heart and for so many of us her lyrics mean something. We've been there. I'm a youth leader and mentor teenage girls, and Taylor is one of few girls that are in the Hollywood limelight that I would truly want them to emulate. She's beautiful. I wish her MUCH success with this and future albums. She's a star in my eyes. :)r best dress.

015206396X|3.0|Many of the other reviews did a good job at describing the plot, so I'll refrain from that. Anyway, while I found the premise of the story interesting, and I normally enjoy fantasies with strong female characters, this one was a bit of a disappointment for me. Mainly, I didn't care for the love story or the main character's attitudes. I love romantic stories, and I didn't really care for the heroine's stance on relationships, it kinda ruined my enjoyment of the story and ending. Basically, the main character is determined to never marry or have children. This is because she has been treated poorly by men in her life.<br /><br />However even though she falls in love and meets a man she supposedly trusts, she refuses to even consider marrying him, and the ramifications and future of the type of relationship she wants to continue with this man she loves are never really discussed or considered, especially considering the role and responsibilities of her lover. Maybe a sequel will explain what will happen to them? Either way I had a hard time seeing how her being mistreated by some men meant she could never marry one she happened to love and trust. It just made no sense.
B001GQSY5K|2.0|I like animated films..not just from Disney, even some computer animation films like Toy Story. However when it comes to this animated version of the Clone Wars, I suggest you use the force and pass this dvd by. The animation of this film  reminds me of the WII, Playstation or DS versions of the Force Unleased game. This animation is one step up from Lego Star Wars<br /><br />The action in this film  is filled with action dog fights in space  and battles on the ground with a pencil thin plot of the Jedis saving the kidnapped Jabba the Hut's child.<br /><br />So why else didn't I like it? I love the Cartoon Network's original Clone Wars ( [[ASIN:B0006Z2LMO Star Wars - Clone Wars, Vol. 1]]) that was done a few years ago. This film is a pilot for the new Cartoon Network series. If this film is an example what to expect in the future I would pass on the series.<br /><br />The character interplay is weak at best. Ankin and Ben seems more disrespectful to each other, not like in the movies. Ankin is also saddled with his own Padawan. She seems over cocky like he is..and since she isnt in the live action movies...well you can read the handwritting on animated wall<br /><br />The Vocal talents of Samuel Jackson and Christopher Lee is wasted in this cartoon.<br /><br />So if you are a fan of Star Warsin general, here is another film to add to your collection. I  wont say it is worth no stars, but I wont say it was five star either.. SO Use the FORCE and make the right choice. However after seeing this DVD, my JEDI sense says AVOID young Jedi<br /><br />Bennet Pomerantz AUDIOWORLD

B00064X3FE|4.0|This is a multichannel SACD    My rating is based on how I like the Multichannel mix. On this recording, it's good.    I have this wonderful SACD-player at home. It gives me great pleasure to listen to recordings in all my speakers, the 5 channel mix.     It's hard to find good recordings in Multichannel SACD. I search all over the internet and in shops. In shops they don't select Multichannel SACDs as a particular category. It's much better on the Internet.    The problem is to find the Multichannel SACD and not the Stereo SACDs. There are several Internet shops selling SACDs with no such information, what so ever. So also Amazon.com, Amazon.uk and Amazon.de     Sometimes there are customers giving information on whether the SACD is in Multichannel or not. May be it's just me, but I would very much like to have this information.     Please give information on Multichannel or Stereo for the SACD !!
0765342294|5.0|This is an engrossing story of a young boy who has been selected for training at a space academy. Earth is under threat by aliens. The initial battles in space have not gone well. Earth's only hope is to find and train the leaders who can defeat the aliens in the few years breathing space that has been won before the aliens return. Children are evaluated to see if they have the qualities to be those leaders, and the few that show they are intelligent enough, determined enough, and ruthless enough are sent into space to be trained. The regime is brutal and brutalising, but the main character, Ender Wiggin shows compassion and regret as he is forced to take actions he would rather not. You feel for this small child who has the hopes of humanity riding on his shoulders.
B001GQ2TGA|5.0|I absolutely love this album! And I don't see how anyone can see any \\"commercialism\\" in it.. She writes her own songs, comes up with her own melodies, etc. I guess there always has to be those few people who like to complain all the time though. *shrug* Now to the CD...I especially love the songs, \\"White Is In The Winter Night\\", \\"O Come, O Come, Emmanuel\\", and \\"Trains And Winter Rains\\". Don't get me wrong, these aren't the ONLY songs I like, they are just the ones I find completely original. I have read some reviews where people were complaining about the album's \\"Winter\\" theme. Um, hello, the name of the CD is, \\"And Winter Came\\"...What more did you expect? I find her voice to be haunting in almost ALL the tracks. You can't listen to one song on the CD and not not expect to get cold chills.     Who knows though, maybe I'm crazy and I'm willing to accept anything Enya puts out.     Guess you'll just have to buy it and find out on your own. ;)

0446402389|5.0|Child 44 is surprisingly well done - surprisingly in that it is a first novel, surprisingly that it is a thriller and I suppose I'm not used to the genre being particularly well written.  I highly recommend it, and have sung its praises to many friends and family members.  I would particularly recommend it if you like history/communist studies.  It's good even if you don't, but the basic background I have in USSR-history only added to the reading experience for me.<br />The strongest aspect of Tom Rob Smith's work is the development of the environment of Soviet Russia under Stalin and the tensions between the ideals and the reality.  This work of fiction is very well researched and Smith has an excellent grasp on life in Soviet Russia and the inner workings of the Communist party.  The main character, a KGB war hero, is faced with the deterioration of everything that he has believed in all his life.  This conflict, not the murder mystery itself, is what makes this novel great.<br /><br />As a murder mystery, it has its flaws.  Several readers have already stated their disappointment in the ending.  While I don't share their disappointment, I don't think that the murder mystery itself was particularly well established.  In particular, I don't think the connection between the murder and the murders was well defined.  The murders themselves, the profile of the serial killer (the serial killer as a character is probably Smith's weakest example of character development), and Leo's quest to solve it seems like an afterthought.  In a lot of ways, it seems like Smith got so caught up in Stalinist Russia that he forgot that what he was writing was a murder mystery.  Regardless - Smith's development of a fictional Soviet Russia places his work as a piece of a literature well above most mainstream murder mysteries that you will find.<br /><br />I look forward to his next novel, because I think that the disconnect that I discussed is something that will improve with experience and I have nothing but high expectations for Tom Rob Smith's future work.and I have nothing but high expectations for Tom Rob Smith's future work.
B001DE29SS|5.0|In the hands of director Richard Attenborough, Charlie Chaplin's life story becomes a sweeping and touching drama.  Robert Downey, Jr. gives an unforgettable performance as Chaplin, who rose from the slums of London to become Hollywood's favorite silent movie character, the Tramp.  Along the way, Charlie had to deal with his mother's insanity, his love affairs, marriages, and a paternity scandal, all involving much younger women, and investigation by none other than J. Edgar Hoover.<br /><br />This very entertaining story vividly recreates the beginnings of the movie industry.  The sets and costumes are magnificent, as is the John Barry soundtrack, which features Chaplin's own song, \\"Smile.\\"  Downey gives the performance of a lifetime playing a controversial but ultimately very likeable hero over a span of sixty years.  He oozes charisma.<br /><br />The cast is full of stars but it's all about Downey and he's wonderful.  I've only seen bits of Chaplins' films and didn't expect to like this movie, but I found it fascinating.
B0006Z2KX4|5.0|This movie is absolutely hilarious! I just love Cary Grant and Katherine Hepburn in this film! She has her own unique character in this film, she is a bit ditzy, but head over heels in love with Cary Grant's character. He, however, doesn't feel the same about her, but is reluctant to stay with her because she asks him to, or because she keeps preventing him from leaving! This movie is definitely one of my favorite old black & whites.
B001FBSMW6|3.0|I am sorry but I too am a huge keane fan. I am listening to their B Sides right now as I type this. Who told Keane that 80's synth music was good for them? That it was the right path to take? The first four songs are devoid of the Keane passion and beautiful sounds I have just absolutely grown to love. The rest of the album is a little better and may grow on you but it is still not up to par for Keane. Is this the end? Are there no more \\"Bedshaped\\" quality songs left? H and F is an album you can play from beginning to end without skipping a song. Same with UTIS. Not even close with this album. I know there are some here who say this album is great. In truth, it is not. Keane are as one of the new songs title says \\"better than this\\". I waited two year for this. Hopefully this is something they had to try and will go back to making quality music.Music where you can hear Tom's voice, Tim's piano and Richard's drums clearly and with a sound that is theirs not Bowies.

0307269752|4.0|I loved this book. I just want to give a warning , it is graphic in some parts but just skip those parts and you should be ok. The characters in this book seem so life-like that at any moment they could appear in real life! The crux of the story is Henrik Vanger hires Mikael Bloomkvist to investigate the mysterious disappearance of his niece year ago. Her name was Harriet and she was 16, the odd part is at the time she went missing the island was completely closed off because of a car accident. This leads Bloomkivst into researching the most dysfunctional family in literature! There is also Lisbeth Salander who is a top notch private invetigator with a shady background.  Just when you think the book is finished with the identification of the killer it takes another turn! This is a great book if you like thrillers it is written so that it goes back and forth between characters. It's face paced good time! Except for the graphic violence in SOME parts of the novel I highly reccommend it!
B00026ZG10|4.0|True Lies has long been on the Sid the Elf back-burner. It was on the list of films that must be reviewed at some point, and kind of became an emergency B. It was like the Vinny Testaverde of B, weren't too excited to use it because of the apparent clumsiness involved, but if first and second options failed, you might be ok going with it. Well, we officially went into emergency B mode this week so we went with True Lies. It turns out that we were exactly right, there was a ton of clumsiness to endure, but in the end Sid came out ok. Really, you're never in bad hands with Arnold. If Amazon had his California tourism commercials on DVD, we'd not only review them, we'd give them 5 stars. The point is, we could get a laugh or a hundred out of Arnold saying anything at all. True lies was no exception.<br /><br />In this film, Arnold plays  super terrific secret agent Harry Tasker. Tasker's family believes he is a computer salesman, that he loves the computer business, and that he is an incredibly boring person. His mission is to track down nuclear warheads stolen by an arms smuggler from Kazakhstan. We were blown away when we learned that Borat's country was prominently involved in this film. So Arnold goes to a party at the arms dealer's house where he meets Cassandra from [[ASIN:B00005JH9K Wayne's World 2]]. She is an antique dealer who is using her business as a front to smuggle the warheads for Aziz the leader of a terrorist organization into U.S. and A, greatest country in the world. Once Arnold starts poking around the situation, Aziz decides to follow him. Arnold, of course, is much too smart for this. He leads Aziz into a mall where he procedes to catch him with the front and make Aziz blead inside his chest. Aziz manages to get away on a motorcycle, being chased by Arnold on a horse. A terribly B action sequence ensues and Aziz gets away. Just great B all-around, trust us.<br /><br />Arnold then finds out that his wife, Laurie Strode, is having a kind of affair with a guy named Simon, who is a B version of Lester Diamond. This is the intentional comedy part of the film with Arnold using secret agent methods to track Simon and his wife. Simon pretends to be a spy to get chicks. Harry and his sidekick, Tom Arnold, kidnap Laurie and interigate her through a one-way mirror. They find out that Mrs. Tasker hasn't done anything with Simon Diamond, but that she is bored with Harry and craves adventure. So Harry gives her a fake assignment, which entails her going to a hotel room and getting ready to have a sexy time with a supposed stranger, even though it was really Arnold doing soundboard in the shadows. Anyway, the terrorists bust into the hotel room and take Harry and Helen prisioner. Some of the most ridiculous action sequences ever filmed ensue, including the famous Arnold iso-rowing Jamie Lee Curtis from the limo to the helicopter scene. So he just saved his wife from the terrorists, now they have kidnapped his daughter. Harry's daughter is played by a young Eliza Dushku. In case you were wondering, the ruling on the field is that it is ok to think she's hot here--moving on. She manages to get the arming key for the missles and has Aziz chase her onto the top of a skyscraper. Arnold flies to her in a marine jet and has her jump in. Ok. Aziz manages to jump onto the plane as well, but he is hanging from a missle. So Arnold fires the missle into a helicopter carrying the other terrorists and kills them all. That encapsulates why Sid believes Arnold should be the sole exception to the law stating the president must be born in the U.S. At the end of the film, we see that Arnold and Jamie Lee are now secret agent partners as they go off to a mission together.<br /><br />This film was an action-comedy(both intentional and unintentional), by James Cameron. We liked it, but we also lost interest in the second half of the film. Maybe we just couldn't resist the lure of the Arnold soundboard after listening to him for a solid 45 minutes. Maybe it was only enjoyable after doing a unit in the bushes and making countless \\"Good. Now we are having fun\\" jokes and assesing the parallels of the film with Wayne's World 2 because of Charlton Heston and Tia Carrere. If you're an Arnold fan, it's certainly a must.

Now we are having fun\\" jokes and assesing the parallels of the film with Wayne's World 2 because of Charlton Heston and Tia Carrere. If you're an Arnold fan, it's certainly a must.

B000000W5L|5.0|This is, simply, the greatest Stones album and one of the greatest complete albums of all time, period.  One can draw a direct line from Robert Johnson to the Stones with no apologies.  It takes several listens to fully appreciate the absolute genius but is well worth the time.  I bought my first copy around 1980 on the recommendation of a friend who swore if I didn't like it, he'd buy it back from me.  At first I was not impressed and almost took him up on the offer but over time I came to understand what he saw in it and now without question list this as my all time favorite album.  Boy, am I glad I kept it.  This is NOT a rock and roll album, it is a pure blues album.  Personally I physically cannot sit still while listening to Ventilator Blues.  The herky-Jerky feel and anticipation of the dropped snare shots is classic delta. Buy this album, you will not be disappointed.
B001EO2UJK|5.0|I will try to be brief, since Mr. Kerner's review covers many of the highlights of this fantastic box (although I can't imagine hearing these albums again, with the addition of such fantastic sound, and not giving this set a 5 rating).  Still, hats off to his fine review.  These albums are the holy grail of \\"old Genesis\\" fans (as well as those who appreciate all of the band's incarnations and recordings.    The SOUND is reason, in and of itself, to buy this box.  Even those of us who have heard every note of this music countless times will appreciate the new listening experience afforded by the CD and DVD remixes.    What do you get in addition to all of the albums in finely remastered CD and 5.1 DVD mixes?  Well, substantial live footage (although it's a shame that a full performance of The Lamb is not available, no fault of the band or Rhino, I'm sure), great interviews from the band members, a bonus CD and DVD of material (some that was available on the archive set, some on disc for the first time), and an excellent booklet of notes - although I'd strongly recommend the recent \\"Genesis Chapter & Verse\\" book to any fan.    Bottom line.  Highest of recommendations.
B001GQ2TGA|3.0|This is a good cd if you started out as an Enya fan with Amarantine. She put a few songs that were part of import cds or singles, which is fine if you don't have said cds already (like me). One song was even renamed from a previous recording. This is nothing new as she has done this before. The thing that seems to trouble me with this cd is the continuation of poorly written lyrics. The first 3-4 cds seemed to be so \\"heartfelt\\" but anyone that has followed her since day one can tell that Roma is really trying to make Enya more mainstream. I too miss the little extras such as Enya playing different instruments, in particular traditional irish ones. She seems to have forgotten the Irish music influenece which made her sound so great. The cd is a good one with several enjoyable songs but it won't be a cd that stays in my cd changer for very long.
0307269752|3.0|'The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo' is a well plotted crime thriller that suffers a bit from a sub-par translation from Stieg Larsson's native Swedish.<br /><br />The translation was never so bad that it prevented easy understanding but the book was full of small incidents where a character's thoughts or words didn't seem authentic. Larsson also has a habit of dropping completely unnecessary technical details on the reader. There are times when knowing the exact model of motorcycle or computer adds to a reader's feel for a character but there are times in 'The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo' when Larsson drops in the specific model of cell phone and it interrupts the flow of the novel.<br /><br />Translation and nit-picky writing issues aside, 'The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo' is a pretty good mystery novel. The characters aren't necessarily any deeper than those you would find in a Nelson DeMille novel and the plot is equally improbable. It does, however, manage to weave shady financial power brokers, serial killers, family power squabbles, hackers, outcasts and the publishing industry into an engrossing whole.<br /><br />The ending is a bit weak, but 'The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo' is apparently the first in a series so the ending makes sense. When 'The Girl Who Played with Fire' is released in August of '09, I'll be looking forward to reading it.
015206396X|5.0|I had just heard of this book and thought it sounded interesting so I gave it a shot.  I couldn't put it down once I opened it.  I loved Katsa and I loved her relationship with Po.  The whole book was just great and I think it'll be one I go back to read again!!
B001DU8T6S|5.0|As a long time Queen fan, I resisted the new line up for a long time. Then I got the Queen plus Paul Rodgers live cd as a gift and was so pleasantly surprised that when this new one came out, I had to have it. I was not disappointed! This is NOT Queen with a Freddie replacement. This is a new, different path for these musicians to tread. They do the old stuff with respect and feeling, but this new stuff, I am just so blown away with it, I cannot wait to see what the future brings! In my opinion, the best two songs on this cd are \\"Small\\" and \\"Time to Shine\\". They are beautiful, soulful ballads with heart and spirit. I just love Paul's voice, I have heard it many times in the past, he has been around a very long time, but his voice just fits these songs so perfectly. I get chills from it! Whether you are  are a serious Queen fan or just a fan of really great music, this cd is not to be missed! My hats off to the guys, can't wait to see what they do next!
0385335997|4.0|Escapism, adventure, easy reading, and spicy - good for a long trip or snippet reading when you can steal time.   Recommended for adult women with a healthy sense of imagination.   The romantic aspect appealed to me less than the adventure and historical aspects.  Not particularly well written or profound, rather for busy women who like to read to escape -  this is a great series.  The first book was best, the second slightly feeble, but this, the third, picks up steam and the content is varied and captivating.   I want to visit Scotland now!
B000000OA6|4.0|\\"Innuendo\\" was released in February of 1992. The single \\"These are The Days Of Our Lives\\" was issued ahead of the album to little airplay, while \\"Headlong\\" fared better at rock radio. The video for \\"Days\\" was interesting in that Mercury seemed frail looking and in poor health. In November, Freddie Mercury released a press statement that he was terminally ill with AIDS, and then died within days. As is now well known, Mercury was fighting to complete this album (along with tracks that eventually would become [[ASIN:B000000OE7 Made in Heaven]]) as his last testament.<br /><br />As such, \\"Innuendo\\" is a really solid late Queen album, as good as [[ASIN:B000000OAX A Kind of Magic]] and equal to [[ASIN:B000000OA8 A Day At The Races]]. Mortality was obviously weighing heavily on Mercury and his bandmates, as semi-autobiographical numbers like \\"I'm Going Slightly Mad,\\" Mercury's ode to his cats \\"Delilah,\\" the bittersweet \\"Days\\" and the stately \\"The Show Must Go On\\" all indicate. Brain May's guitar is hotter here than on many of their post-[[ASIN:B000000OAJ Game]], on both \\"Bijou\\" and the epic title track.<br /><br />Queen's pop sense also was in full swing here, with such missed opportunities for singles as \\"All God's Children\\" and \\"I Can't Live With You.\\" Even though Mercury was in failing health, the band's tradition for pomp and grandeur continued with an album launch party occurring on the fabled Queen Mary liner in the US after Hollywood Records signed the band in the US. It's a considerable feat that the band decided to go out at full-throttle, with Mercury delivering some top-notch work. As the album closes, Mercury delivers what could be his finest goodbye.<br /><br />\\"My soul is painted<br />like the wings of butterflies,<br />Fairy tales of yesterday,<br />will grow but never die,<br />I can fly, my friends!<br />The Show must go on!\\"
0575081406|2.0|I think that the book has its merits, but they are lost on with a onslaught of words. I understand charter building, but this book just goes on and on and on. Save your time and buy the First law series. Although if you like a meandering book, go for it.
B000025RHI|5.0|I bought this CD based on the Amazon reviews - and it is now one of my favorites.
