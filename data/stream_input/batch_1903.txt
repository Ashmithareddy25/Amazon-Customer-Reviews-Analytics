B001E75QGG|1.0|There are a lot of horrible sequels in the movie world.<br /><br />Both Matrix follow ups, Major League 2, Ocean's 12, to name just a few of the flops out there....but the Crystal Skulls takes the top prize of the worst sequel ever by a comfortable margin.<br /><br />Spoiler alert....and by alert I mean you should read this now to prevent the injustice of sitting through 2 hours to find out how it ends...<br /><br />Aliens? Seriously? You went with aliens as the mystical force? The first 3 films were deeply rooted in historical references. The 1st and 3rd films were awash in Judeo Christian history. The 2nd was based on the factual Thuggee cult from the 14th to 19th Century in India. Not to mention the Nazis who could be found at every turn, with the films capitalizing on Hitler's well documented obsession with searching for Judeo Christian artifacts. This made the Nazi involvement in searching for the Lost Ark and the Holy Grail 100% believable, with just enough supernatural mysticism (melting faces from looking inside the Ark, healing powers of the Grail, voodoo like powers of the Thuggee cult leader...etc...)<br /><br />But the Soviets seeking out Aliens in South America was just completely made up crap. Also...using a refrigerator to protect yourself from a nuclear bomb 100 yards away? Really? I can accept giant bolders set up as booby traps to protect golden heads in the jungle, but protection from a hydrogen bomb by hiding in a fridge? What idiot thinks up this stuff? Oh yeah...the same mind that gave us Jar Jar Binks.<br /><br />I have the original Jones trilogy in a DVD box set. The box came with a bonus disc that had some lame special features on it. When I got it prior to Crystal Skulls coming out I was excited that one day I could replace that bonus disc in the box set with the Indy 4 disc. Then I saw Indy 4 in the theater. Instantly that bonus disc became the crown jewel of my DVD collection just because it's NOT Indy 4.<br /><br />There is now talk of an Indy 5. This film should feature Lucas, Spielberg, and Ford on screen for 2 hours just apologizing for Indy 4. I'd actually pay movie ticket prices to see that.n Indy 5.

B00742BVW8|1.0|This film is unrelentingly awful!<br /><br />To begin with, the martial arts sequences are pretentious and silly to the point of being unwatchable.  I've been a fan of Chinese martial arts movies since getting hooked on Shaw Brothers films in the mid-1970's, and I understand that some suspension of disbelief is required, but this film is completely over the edge.  Scene after scene of ridiculous flying swordsmen, walking/fighting on water, characters making cow-eyes at each other to express deep emotional soulfulness, and silly fight scenes back dropped by fluttering panels of colored silk.  Of course, because there is zero character development, it's hard to give a damn about any of it, and it all just plays as affected and goofy.<br /><br />More importantly, the central message of this film appears to be that \\"national unity\\" justifies government brutality.  As best as I can make out in this absurd wreck of a film, four assassins start out wanting to overthrow a violent king who has destroyed their homes and families.  One of the assassins (Broken Sword) has a change of heart, because he \\"realizes\\" that only this king can conquer and unify the country.  To convince the Jet Li character also to abandon his quest to kill the king (which he does), Broken Sword uses his gauzy spiritual calligraphy to write two words in the sand:  \\"Our Land.\\"  A better two words would have been \\"Totalitarian Propaganda.\\"<br /><br />The ultimate point of the film is that violent oppression in the service of totalitarian authority -- raining down arrows on schools, the murder of heroes, and, presumably, crushing democracy protesters under tank treads -- are all to be applauded if preformed in the service of a unified central government.  One can't help but think Leni Riefenstahl would approve.<br /><br />Awful, awful, awful!  Spend your time and money elsewhere.

B0071XO8RA|5.0|Wool Omnibus edition was given to me by a friend at a difficult time in my life where it has been hard to focus on reading, so it was an incredible treat to be given the gift of total escape into a story that pulled me through it and I couldn't stop turning pages. It is 5 related stories, but felt more like one big novel, satisfyingly long, and with well fleshed-out characters and plot, plenty of suspense and satisfying plot twists. It deals with important issues of truth and intellectual freedom vs mind control and manipulation. Sci-Fi is not usually my \\"thing\\" but Wool seems to transcend its genre I would absolutely recommend this to anyone. I can't wait to read more in this series!

B005HV6Y5W|5.0|[*One big spoiler*] Malick muses on the music of the spheres, the interplay of forces that created and sustain the universe, and on our place within it.  We see stunning visuals of the universe exploding into existence, of stars and galaxies forming, and of the earth accreting.  Life begins, dinosaurs roam, rule, and are summarily wiped out by a random asteroid.  Quotes from the Book of Job, echoed in a church service, refer to the mystery of why bad things happen while God does nothing to prevent them.  Although there are many theological references and a definite spiritual tone to the film, it could be that the natural forces of the universe are so vast, so unpredictable and so beyond our ability to control that a capricious God the Father is as good a way to conceptualize it as any other.  The dinosaurs didn't philosophize about the random asteroid that caused their destruction, and perhaps neither should we.<br /><br />Now we see the universe represented in microcosm by a family, ruled not by a god, but by a stern and sometimes capricious disciplinarian of a father.  (He demands the title, \\"father,\\" never \\"dad.\\")  The eldest son can't seem to please him.  The father is emotionally distant.  Rules are set that are hard to follow, and harsh punishments are handed out for minor infractions.  The boy acts out, and is headed for delinquency, or worse.  He's jealous of his younger brother, whose musical bent and less rebellious nature attracts less unpleasant attention from the father.  But he loves and feels protective toward his younger sibling, and we get the sense that this relationship manages to get him through the trial of his upbringing, and helps him become a successful adult.<br /><br />We find out at the very start of the film that the younger brother has died, with the story above unfolding in a non-sequential flashback.  At the end, we see a metaphorical reunion of the living and the spirits of the dead on what is perhaps a literal view of the plutonian shore.  With the older brother and other family members (living? dead?) in attendance, the younger brother is consigned back to the universe.<br /><br />Disney called this sort of thing the Circle of Life.  But with Malick, it's more the Trajectory of Life.  Individually, we're born, we live, we mingle with and affect all the others around us, and then we die, returning to where we were before we were born.  There is a kind of consolation in the chaos, and in its relentless inevitability.  How on earth could someone turn metaphysics into a movie?  That's the reason you should see the Tree of Life.

B000687M48|1.0|Short and to the point, the audio disk of this combo set is not mixed well at all.  Amy is \\"buried in the mix\\" (industry talk for you can't hear her over the rest of the band).  In fact, the audience cheers and screaming are frequently more audible than poor Amy.  I hope they fired their sound people after this was released.<br /><br />The only exceptions are the recordings here Amy is accompanied only by (or primarily by) piano/keyboard (such as \\"Breathe No More - Track 8 or \\"My Immortal\\" - Track 9), or sections where the band pauses for her solo riffs.  For those tracks, Amy is audible but the mix is still off (the audience is generally too loud throughout the disk).<br /><br />Naturally, these comments do not apply to the last track (\\"Missing\\") which is a studio recording.  This track is not bad, but not worth purchasing the album solely to add this to your collection.<br /><br />I love Evanescence and am proud to claim the same home town (Little Rock, Arkansas), but this recording does not do them justice.  If you are a fan that does not care about the quality of the recording, or are primarily interested in the DVD, you can change this rating to a 3.5 (yes, I realize that Amazon does not have \\"half\\" stars, but that's all I'm willing to give.
1594487154|5.0|You're somewhere between eighteen and thirty-two years old. Someone told you about Dan Pink and this book. While you can take on one more project much like a bucket of overflowing water can take on one more drop, you have this internal drive to become more effective. Simply put, you are not about to wait eight, twelve or twenty-one years to make a difference in this world.<br /><br />You are wise to check out To Sell is Human and you are about to be happy as that one drop of water who elbowed herself into the bucket when I describe the amount of attention you'll need to gain from Dan's wisdom.<br /><br />The book is divided into three parts. If you can believe there are sleazeball, fast-talking salesman out there; if you believe their methods will not work in this hyper-connected world of ours; and if you believe that when you get real, we really all are in sales, then you can go light on Part I. There is a contingent of people out there who need facts, figures and examples to get their minds around what you and I already know to be. No worries. Dan puts his arm around these folks and gently guides them to understanding.<br /><br />A word of caution: The term sales can stymie you. You ask, \\"I'm a teacher. How can this book help me?\\" I found that if I substitute the notions to be understood and or to understand instead of sales, learning flows. A little secret: This book is really about human relations and helping people.<br /><br />Part Two: How to Be, is based on the concepts of  Attunement, Buoyancy and Clarity.<br />Part Three: What to Do, is based on Pitch, Improvise and Serve.<br /><br />You can either visit Dan's Website or peruse some of the other reviews here to gain a foothold on these concepts - but it's really not necessary.<br /><br />Now, onto you. To this point in history, sales training has mostly been built on techniques, following scripts and coercing others. All mechanical. All very non-human. Dan simply connects traits that most of us have or know that we should have, with the concepts described in Parts Two and Three. He taps into our human side as he helps us understand others, helps us to be understood (get our point across) and helps us to help others.<br /><br />And because these concepts are so human, you'll not have to do a deep dive into learning them. You will simply connect Dan's terminology to stuff that's already inside of you. It will make sense and it will instill hope.<br /><br />I cannot overstate the importance of not getting hung up on the words sell or sales. If you don't, To Sell is Human will help you to become more effective on your way to making a difference in this world.that we should have, with the concepts described in Parts Two and Three.

The last 8 years I have been getting it professionally straightened. My thyroid was going a little hinky and my hair started breaking, so . . . I thought why not try curly. I bought the book, started doing what was suggested, I bought deva products, cut all my hair off and now have a pixie cut and it's curly on top and I really like it. After using No-Poo and One Condition and AnGel, I can't believe that my curls actually look good.

B0076DELIG|5.0|I am an infrequent book reader, and often if a book doesn't pull me in I end up not finishing it.<br />This was my first Michael Connelly novel and I have to say it was a total pleasure.  The characters, story, and pace of the book were pitch perfect.  I love mysteries and police detective work.  You can tell Connelly is a master at this form.<br /><br />I did start off with the first-six-chapters-free version.  I do suggest that for readers wondering if they will like this or not.  It was about the first 1/3 of the book - enough to really pull you in or judge that maybe it's not your cup of tea.

0756405890|4.0|The Name of Wind takes place in a world with magic, heroes and dragons. Rothfuss though has gone to great lengths to make all of that believable. This book came to me with high praise and great promises to live up to. I've had a few books succeed in that attempt but most fall very short.<br /><br />We open the story on an innkeeper who tends his failing inn with an assistant. It's not long before we learn that our innkeeper is actually one of the greatest heroes of the land, a legend in his own time. The Chronicler comes through town and learns of the innkeeper's past and insists on writing the story down. It is through that process that we hear the story from the mouth of the one person who was there through all of it.<br /><br />The story of Kvoth is of a young man who is bright and curious and has a wonderful early life but loses it all. As he seeks to pick up the pieces of his life he faces trials and tribulations that seem believable enough and don't always paint him as the hero. It seems that as he achieves he of his desires he almost immediately jeopardizes that desire for his next wish.<br /><br />The writing style is very easy to read. I don't want to call it simplistic because it conveys powerful images and messages but it will not challenge anyone who reads it. Rothfuss builds and elaborate world with rules that tie it to aspects of our own (conservation of energy, thermodynamics and more) that make the magic system believable and understandable but still leave him the opportunity to surprise us.<br /><br />I have very few complaints about this book. If there was one thing that I wish was conveyed better it would be the hero's all encompassing obsession for some things. Kvoth is a bit Obsessive Compulsive and it plays oddly when he obsesses over something thing and old obsession swings past and derails his current focus by drawing him back in. It can be a bit jarring and hard to follow his motivations at those times.<br /><br />Overall, the book is exceptionally good and I will read the sequel very soon then wait with everyone else for the third and final novel. It's a wait I almost look forward too.

B06XXNYHRQ|4.0|“Dredd” takes place in a post-apocalypse world. The planet has been destroyed by nuclear war and people live in massive cities called blocks. Dredd (Kark Urban) is a judge who serves as every branch of the criminal justice system all rolled into one. Judges patrol the urban landscape on super-fast motorcycles, dispensing swift justice. They are empowered to arrest, convict, sentence, and execute criminals.<br /><br />Dredd is assigned a rookie partner, Anderson (Olivia Thereby), who failed the judge training system, but a nuclear mutation has given her the ability to read minds, a helpful tool in policing and seeing through bad guys’ lies and deceptions.<br /><br />Dispatched by the central authority, the Judges’ target is Ma-Ma (Lena Headey), a ruthless boss bent on expanding her criminal empire through sales of Slo-Mo, a dangerous reality-altering drug. Set over the course of a single day, the film follows Dredd and his psychic rookie partner as they investigate a triple homicide in a skyscraper slum run by sadistic Ma-Ma.<br /><br />“Dredd” revels in choreographed action sequences and killings meted out in assorted, bloody ways. The film never really ponders the morality of instant justice, and there are some lapses in logic in the screenplay. Whatever its shortcomings, “Dredd” is far superior to the awful Sylvester Stallone “Judge Dredd” of 1995. This one is played straight.<br /><br />The character of Judge Dredd was created by writer John Wagner and artist Carlos Ezquerra, and first appeared in “2000 AD” (1977), a weekly science-fiction anthology comic.<br /><br />Though “Dredd” was originally released in 3D, the 4K Ultra HD version is in standard 2D, though visually impressive. The picture is sharp, with vibrant color as well as deep blacks, providing a rich, inky look. Details are amazing. You can see clearly individual shards of shattered glass, detailed features of buildings, gruesome make-up enhancements, dirt, dust and scratches on helmets, and some cool specifics in debris flying around in action sequences. The CGI still looks good, but not as believable as in the theatrical version. In this case, the enhanced 4K detail shows off the computer work a little too much.<br /><br />Bonus extras on the 2-disc 4K Ultra HD/Blu-ray Combo Pack include 7 behind-the-scenes featurettes and the theatrical trailer. A digital HD copy is enclosed.

0316017930|1.0|I was very disappointed in this book. Perhaps \\"disappointed\\" is the wrong word; my suspicions before reading it were that it was probably warmed over science made palatable for the general public and that's pretty much how it turned out, so I guess it met my expectations.<br /><br />His whole premise that \\"outliers\\" are the beneficiaries of the circumstances of their respective environments seemed self-evident, almost tautological. He belittles the concept of \\"self made men\\" and implies that their efforts to attain their unusual levels of success had less to do with those efforts than their lucky circumstances, downplaying the fact that their hard work and extraordinary abilities were certainly as crucial to their success as their good fortune of finding themselves in the right place at the right time. Not everyone born in those lucky circumstances found their way to the top of their professions; perhaps ability and hard work had something to do with it.<br /><br />His first examples in support of his position, the preponderance of outstanding hockey and soccer players born during the months following the cut-off date for eligibility in their respective leagues, were interesting, but unconvincing arguments. In basic terms, he states that the logical beneficiaries of the system set up by the leagues to recruit players (the older, bigger players who received more attention and training) were the same ones who ultimately had the highest levels of success. And his point is..? Seems like the system worked. The true outliers, the few players born on the wrong side of the cutoff that made it to the elite levels, were ignored in Gladwell's analysis. Maybe hard work and ability had something to do with their success, as well.<br /><br />His considerations of Bill Gates and Bill Joy were also unconvincing in support of his thesis. They both had access to computer facilities that were generally unavailable to the vast majority of their contemporaries and took full advantage oftheir lucky circumstances to launch themselves towards incredibly successful careers. If they hadn't been so lucky, they wouldn't have become so successful. Again, what's Gladwell's point again? It seems probable that if Bill Gates and Bill Joy didn't have access to those computers, that someone else would have and we would be talking about two different people who also put in the 10,000 hours of hard work and had the minds that these two had. Of course luck and the circumstances of his world have a lot to do with a person's success. The pertinent point is that those who do succeed in a particular world recognize opportunity and do the work necessary to benefit from it.<br /><br />I could go on in this vein for a while and ignore the general sloppiness of the presentation of the material, but I won't. His facts regarding the Turner/Howard feud were so scrambled and contradictory that the details became irrelevant. Who owned the general store, anyway- the Howards or the Turners? And was it Korean Air or Korean Airlines flight 801 that crashed in Guam? The conflicting facts regarding both of these incidents should have been caught by a copy editor.<br /><br />I did find the second half of the book dealing with cultural legacies to be much more interesting than the first half which dealt with opportunity. His discussion of the possible cultural causes of airline crashes and Asian dominance in math was fascinating and almost redeemed the book. Almost..
B00846REIS|1.0|The book, &#34;Total Recall&#34;, is a sad and boring attempt to copy &#34;Fifty Shades of Grey&#34;. Shame on the author:(
0525953728|3.0|Not much not already in the newspapers. Nothing on policy. Not much about training. Apparently, the SEALs are trained to kill, not capture; at least that's how they act in combat.<br /><br />Felt like best parts were omitted.<br /><br />Writing clear but flat. No inspiration.
B009SQRL4U|3.0|Im picky about we allow to add to our holiday watchlist, however my kids enjoys a dreamworks quality Santa Claus twist of a film. Defintely fun.
B006O3MU96|2.0|It's a good app, but they should make it part of Doodle jump instead of it being seperate. It's one world instead of the multiple in Doodle jump. It's not worth the money.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|This book is very very good. The ending felt like it left you hanging in suspense! It made me want to read the next one right away!
B001LM1456|3.0|Edward Norton is a great actor and does an excellent job as Bruce Banner. Well worth watching, better writing too.
B0019O6IWU|5.0|This was a required reading book for a class.  Very informative.  Easy reading.  Wold be helpful to anyone looking for a better way to communicate.
B008XG1X18|5.0|this is a great app and a fun website that can be addicting for the creative brain.  Lots of fun!
B0092SQ5EG|5.0|My wife loves katy so thats my great excuse to watch this movie. Katy is really good person and this movie shows you why. All fans should watch!
B009UX2YAC|5.0|I love this app, even though it is a lot like temple run. The graphics are good, it lets you turn off the seasonal mode if it annoys you, especially during Christmastime. It has everything you may want from temple run but didn't get, and you don't have to tilt.
B0095XPZBC|5.0|My only criticism is the picture is a bit more grainy in the Second Season Blu-ray.<br />Not to distraction, thank God.<br />I  am on disc 5, and almost want to wait when Season Three is coming out to watch.<br />This is a superb collection.
0446580848|5.0|I pre-ordered this book months in advance and couldn't wait to get it!  He is one of the best writers out there in my opinion.
B0054JZC6E|5.0|great game but gets a little boring great &quot;im bord&quot; game<br />lol im only doing this for the 250 k money
B00AEJM6H2|5.0|Jewels Star is an excellent matching game. I have tried several versions and this the best so far. Would recommend it to anyone who is looking for this type of game.
B0087GF8ZG|4.0|Light output is OK for small spaces, but that's about it.  I would not recommend this for a closet or anything larger than a cabinet.  The auto-off feature is really nice.  When I open my cabinet they come on automatically and turn off when I close it.
B000YMM3CC|5.0|I watched this movie a couple nights ago on my Kindle Fire just to see what my friends hype was about.  I must say,  I thought it was beautiful and worth every penny!!  Ryan Gosling and Rachel Mcadams have great chemistry.  Its really a tear jerker though, so keep a tissue box close :P
B000YHG72E|5.0|After seeing it for free during broadcast this year, my 6 yr old was dying to see it again a few days later.  It was worth the two dollars since we saw it twice during the 48 hr rental period.  Great movie for kids.
8478885196|5.0|Bought this as a gift for my girlfriend, and she loved! She is a true heart fan of Harry Potter, and she wanted to have all the books from the saga.
B00A7ZWUJC|3.0|...because my kids are around all the time and they repeat everything. From what I have heard I suspect I'd give it 4 stars. However, the language restricts ones ability to listen to this in mixed company. It'll have to be my treat when the kids go to bed.
B0052RDHTM|5.0|Absorbing read.  This is just as good as the Pillars of the Earth and I look forward to reading the third installment as soon as it comes out.
B0094BB4TW|5.0|I like having this on my Kindle can see it better than on my phone and easier to get to than my computer.
B004SJ3BCI|5.0|It is really easy for someone my age (68) to learn and play immediately. Very entertaining and love playing it with my Grandsons.
B0051494MU|5.0|One of the great movies of the 80's.  Saw this about 20 years ago, and when I saw it again it was just as good as the first time.  This movie does not age, as many movies do.
8478884955|5.0|Bought this as a gift for my girlfriend in our aniversary, and she loved! She is a true heart fan of Harry Potter, and she wanted to have all the books from the saga.
B009MCRHH6|1.0|Would not download.  Not a good purchase.  I do not recommend.  What more can I say.  Not a good download.
B007FEFLTO|5.0|I loved Pillars of the Earth and this trilogy is just as interesting and absorbing.  I can't wait for the 3rd installment to come out.
0743297334|5.0|Just a book about a few friends hanging out and all the stuff that happens to them. No explosions. No crazy mysteries to solve. No car chases. No bombs to diffuse or world to save. No complex love triangles. It's all really rather mundane. It's basically Seinfeld/Entourage in the 1920s. It's a book about nothing.<br /><br />I love this book because it reminds me of my times with my friends--road trips, bars, clubs, hangovers, girl troubles, lazy summer days, etc. It's not the specific details in the book, but the interactions of the characters that strikes a familiar chord.<br /><br />This book is classic Hemingway: simple, but surprisingly rich and engaging. Like I said, it's a book about nothing, but as you turn that last page, you can't help but feel as though you've been hanging out with them all along. You don't want the road trip to end.
B002MQYOFW|4.0|I thought this book would have been a shallow love story but this book does not shy from the brutal dystopian world that these people are forced to live in
0812982622|4.0|I enjoyed this book although it didn't live up to the publicity.  It is not a love story, and the lack of female characters until near the end lessened my enjoyment.  The plot gets a slow start and almost lost me, but I persevered, and the male protagonist is an<br />interesting character.<br />I probably wouldn't have picked this book on my own; it was a book club selection for me.
B005FPT51K|5.0|This is an amazing product. I have to admit I was dubious after reading so many of the reviews that said this didn't work well, and all I can say is I was amazed at how easy it was to set up. I followed the recommendations from other reviews that said \\"make sure you read the manual\\". I hooked up the monitor to our router box and within 5 minutes it was working!! (and this coming from someone who generally doesn't do well with electronics!!)  The hardest part for me was setting it up so that I can view the video from outside our house. Not only can I check in on my baby (and my dog!!) where-ever I am (work, grocery store etc) but my family overseas can also see baby from Europe - and for my mom, being able to see her first grandchild from thousands of miles away has just made her year!!! Using the app to view on the ipad/iphone really makes it so easy and user friendly. Me and my husband highly recommend this product for anyone who's looking for a video monitor for their baby. You can add multiple cameras and the sound quality is also great!!! Highly highly recommend this! :-)
B0071R43MG|5.0|If you like Joe you'll love this show! Well produced with great picture and sound. CRANK IT UP! Nice work Satch see you soon!<br />CaboKev
B007IXWL2C|5.0|First time in many years I have read and I read all three in a week . Loved all three
B0071XO8RA|5.0|Saw this in my recommendations and after checking out some reviews decided to give it a try.  I was pleasantly surprised! It is a well written story with good characters and an interesting twist on the post apocalypse theme.  The omnibus option was good value as well.
B00A757EFW|4.0|Don't get me wrong...this game is great but the controls aren't the best. It can get a bit frustrating. Other than that the game itself is amazing! Wonderful graphics too. I highly recommend this app. What do you have to loose, its free!<br />You cant go wrong with pac-man!!! :-)
B009LK6JS2|4.0|. Not too challenging. Only four missions which can be best in a few hours.Introductory level flight simulator. Good start but needs more missions.
B000PC6A3E|5.0|I have the DVD copy but wanted to watch it in Blu-Ray. I have to say it looks pretty good!
B005BRS8Z6|1.0|I heard a lot good about this book.<br />But there is one slight problem.<br /><br />You have to be a believer to appreciate this book.<br />I am not a believer.
B0084IG8TM|5.0|The thing was amazing for the amount it was it worked like it was new!! And it was cheap!!!i love the hunger games it is really really good!
B00AIQP9DE|5.0|Totally enjoyed this game. Awesome graphics and cool storyline. I didn't love the mini games but no biggie as you can skip without a long wait. Would love a part two.
B0053O89WY|5.0|Season five does not disappoint!  As always, shopping from Amazon really makes getting disc sets like these a pleasure!  Shipping was fast and the set was in great condition.  Looking forward to Season 6!
B007RTAR64|5.0|Her face, clothing, and weaponry very closely approximate Katniss' gear from the movie. My ten year old daughter loves this doll, and she is not a huge Barbie fan.
B003YL4LYI|5.0|I really enjoyed this book. Martin keeps getting better! If you liked the previous books, this one is a no Brainer
B0042RJWTC|5.0|The show is awesome, bonus features are lacking and I was very disappointed. I thought there might be more info on filming locations, but it seems to be the creator / writer rambling on and.
B008JGSM6G|5.0|this game is so much fun to play. I really enjoy the challenge of the puzzles and I also love that its free![[ASIN:B008JGSM6G Flow Free]]
B007SGLZP8|3.0|It was off-putting that the reader was kept, not in suspense, but ignorant of the protagonist grand scheme for fully a half of the book.
B0094BB4TW|1.0|I read the previous reviews on this app, but I figured they would've fixed this issue by now. Apparently not.
B006LSZECO|4.0|I gasped out loud a few times while reading this. It's t really smart and keeps you guessing, I couldn't put it down
B0085LETCG|5.0|Adam Levine's voice is like no other. The man brings goodness and puts his heart into every single song he songs. Have been a fan since the beginning and always will be.

1934030198|5.0|This is an incredible book. I wish there had been a resource like this back in 1982 when I completed my first sprint triathlon. The introductory chapters are a lot of work to read, but pay off when getting into the meat of the book when developing a plan(s) to prepare for upcoming races. I find myself underlining this, and highlighting that as well as taking notes on thoughts, issues, concepts that I want to refer back to later on in the book. I completed my first triathlon in 2012 after a 26-year break from the sport. &#34;Life&#34; got in the way of committing to this &#34;way of life&#34; that is triathlon and the half-ironman distance that I completed has motivated me to look at training in a different way. Oh yea, I will be turning 60 years old in 2013, and will be back for the half-ironman as well as two other races. I see this book preparing me for the races I am going to compete in, in 2013. I would love to have a coach, but as an age grouper, and not being able to afford a coach, I see this book being pivotal in preparing me. I have looked at many other Triathlon training books, but this is indeed The Bible. Great job to Joe Friel in writing this book. This is a must have for anyone serious about succeeding and having fun training and competing in Triathlons.
B003ODIZL6|3.0|I really want a dictionary on my Kindle Fire. I really enjoy learning the meanings  to words. It was required for me to d this review, but I find that I really do like dictionaries.
B009JBWOU0|5.0|Both Christopher Nolan and Christian Bale seem to nail the &#34;Dark&#34; character. Too bad this is the last of these movies.
B009WO7NQO|1.0|rovio gets better n better the reason why I put 1 star is so u can read this and i like messing with the ratings too ;)  anyway this is its totally worth the money..
B005CRQ4GU|4.0|I read this book in about 2 hours and I liked it a lot! its really funny and even my friends took my kindle to read it and liked it! I really liked diary of a wimpy kid the third wheel. you should read it!!
B00A8ECU24|2.0|not what expected. deleted from kindle.  there is nothing more to say.  will not be purchasing again. thank you for reviewing
B009VB97EY|4.0|This prompted me to take in the Chippendales in Vegas.  Gorgeous men with hot bodies,  what woman could resist this.
B009NXV2RK|4.0|Good enough but not up to the standard one has come to expect.The narrative around some of the characters was not plausabile.Timing of movements of people not believable.
B0091LS07E|3.0|Guess I was not ready for the new Alicia Keys. Girl On Fire was the only song that I enjoyed.
B007MNV5WU|5.0|ok I fix everything anyone complains about that's why I have no problems in any game I love this game so all of you guys go play basketball in the gym instead of getting unsatisfied with a stupid phone sheesh &copy;&reg;
B003XF1XOQ|5.0|this is a great book that keeps you guessing till the very end! defenetly one of the best books i've ever read!
B008N1V11U|1.0|This game is really fun.... yet it takes up so much space. All the games by Gameloft are way to pricey and take up a lot of space. If I could I would rate this 0 stars.
B009NPKTN6|5.0|I rate this movie up there with Grease starring John Travolta and Olivia Newton-John.  Love the songs and story line.  Takes me back to my younger days.
B0076DCT2G|4.0|DeMille never disappoints when  John Corey is the character.  Once again Corey's humor makes The Panther more entertaining than most books of the same genre.
B007VUA7VO|5.0|I love this app. I am extremely happy I chose to get it. It has come in very handy when I need to know how long before I need to plug in my kindle.
B0049P1VHS|5.0|What more can I say then I love this series more than any thing ha best show ever I can't wait for the 3rd season, kept me wanting more on the first episode!! A MUST SEE!!
B003O86FMW|5.0|this book is great! my class and I are reading and every time we stop someone asks id we can keep reading because it keeps you guessing. its a great book!!
B00AECGQF2|1.0|this app is fun but does not work at all don't buy app this app has a lot of trouble and needs fixing this shouldn't even have any stars. not worth buying for $2.99
0374275637|4.0|A mustread to people in need to increase their impact. A wise toolkit to structure the message and to be relevant.
B003TSEEDY|5.0|I have never felt more connected to a book like I have with this one. It was beautiful and deep and it felt like he was with me as my friend. Like I was going back and reading my own letters. I loved this book. It's a great experience.<br />Finishing this book... that's what made me feel infinite.
B008JMKN4Y|5.0|Beautiful Disaster is a great read  - I started and finished the book in 2 days. I fell in love with the characters instantly. I wish I was able to experience this in my younger years. Love, love love the book. Will be reading again down the road and looking forward to reading Walking Disaster.
B003JTHXOK|5.0|I would recommend this book to everyone I know. I couldn't put this book down at all. It just gets your attention from the beginning that it's hard to put done. I would read this book over and over again.
B001AH6ZWY|5.0|I love this movie and jumped on the great price.<br /><br />Very intriguing story filled with great acting. Many of the topics touched on in the movie lead to great discussions as well.
B007IXWKUK|4.0|The second book, although written better than the first book, did not seem to be as riveting. Perhaps, in this book, we already know the main characters well enough that none of the steamy parts seem new or as exciting anymore. The author tries to give it some suspense, but it just wasn't enough for me. For the $10 that I paid for this book, I could've read something with a better plot. I'm actually debating whether I want to throw in more money to get the third book....probably not.
1452110581|5.0|Excellent and hilarious read even if you don't have a cat!  If you do have a cat, you'll find yourself wondering which poem in the book describes your cat.
B008H6GH8I|5.0|We enjoy these 3 packs especially sharing with family and friends. Plenty of packing by the shipper, no scratches or cracks in the case.
B00AAX68HG|5.0|I fell in love with this game right when I got to the front page its just so cute and mo&szlig;t of you are right its like cut the rope I just think its the darn cutest. thing ive ever played none the less seen so stop reading this reveiw who cares what I think go purchase it!!!!!!!!!!
B008JGSM6G|5.0|this game is good for your mind it gets harder each time I LOVE this game if I could put more stars on it I would!!!:)
B008MG1E4A|4.0|It was a great window into mind set and life of the warriors who are on the sharp end of the lance. It's hard to imagine these guys continue to go back for more. Thanks to the authors and publisher for a more or less uncensored account. If it had to be cleared by the Pentagon it would still be in the approval loop.
B007J4T2G8|4.0|Like many other reviews, I found the book written in amateur form. Many mistakes throughout the book. Not very realistic but we need to keep in mind that we are reading fiction, not a biography. The steamy content makes up for it though. The author has come up with some very interesting scenarios. However, at the end, I do wonder how many more more new sexual and sensual scenarios can the author come up with in the next book to keep thing fresh?
B005HSL626|3.0|When I want to play the app it says that fruit slice has stoped working , and angry birds it says the same thing to all the angry bird apps .<br /><br />...............
B00AIQP9DE|5.0|Great game! Really enjoyed it. I play a lot of these type games. It had a good mixture of HO and puzzles to solve.
1609611543|4.0|it covers all the questions I had about gluten and wheat and explains the history and gives lots of detail
B002LFPAUC|5.0|great comedy recdommend to any one that asked z z z z z z z z z z z z
B003XF1XOQ|5.0|Loved the last book. Keeps you wanting to read more..could hardly put it down!! A must read trilogy highly recommend ed.
0811879542|5.0|My son loves books and though he is not old enough to understand the concept of this one yet, the bright colors and interactive style make it fun for him already.  Pages are of good quality, not quite strong enough for 10.5 months though. I probably should have waited, but it is such an awesome book!
B00571F26Y|5.0|Being a healthy eater, I finally understand why my sugar levels are so high. Wheat is already out of my diet
B005KJJ4F8|4.0|Great new take on such a old story, carries you through to the end and leaves  you guessing the whole way through
B005VPRETE|5.0|This is the most delightful Lego Friends set of several purchased for my 7 year old daughter.  Fun is moving the butterflies and lady bugs wherever you wish.  The cat and bird with birdhouse are a plus.  Overall, a very creative design my daughter enjoys, and one I wish I owned when her age.
B000VYX8PE|5.0|My children loved reading and listening to these books, and so did their dad and I. Yes the book has a dark theme,  but the author is wickedly funny, and the children are strong and find inventive ways to foil the bad guys. It teaches lessons about resilience and strength when bad things happen to good people. But mostly it is just hysterically funny.  Everyone wants to know what happens next,  and everyone is laughing. My son loved the covers, and collected all the books. Get the audios too - Tim Curry is simply perfect. Excellent series. If your kids aren't sheltered and don't scare easily, they will love these books. And their parents will too.
B009FZHYKU|5.0|Awesome, so intense, just when you thought things couldn't get more morally ambiguous. Season 3 continues with so many twists, and yes, more people die.
B005CRQ4GU|5.0|My son has read all the other books in the series, he got his kindle for Christmas and this was one of his first purchases. He enjoyed it thoroughly.
0374214913|4.0|I enjoyed the book but it was a little slow getting started for me.  After about the first 100 pages it got more interesting and I wanted to keep reading to find out what was going to happen.
B00992CF6W|5.0|I love this game I liked the original minecraft so I was super excited that I could get it on kindle I still like the original minecraft on the Pc so I can craft my own stuff instead of it doing it for me. but best game ever so you should get it is great for kids they can build what ever they want so go mojang so you should get this app because I had zero problems with it so GET THIS APP!!!!!
B00AMBLXP8|4.0|This is one of those movies that you have to see but seeing it once is enough. So take my advice and just rent it. It's funny in many ways and that's what makes it different .
B00APH111U|5.0|I'm not much of a Jim Carry fan, but this is the best Jim Carry movie Iin my opinion.  Loved it!
0811729117|5.0|Very good read for someone who's a ww2 tank buff like myself. The book was a little slow at first, but picked up and turned into a great read. Head's up the author tends to be biased toward the Nazi cause but who can blame him, he gave up six years of his life for it!
B008HK3XKO|5.0|I really like the cover and it fits perfect.  I would recommend it. Seems to be a very sturdy cover.
B009WJ2XT6|3.0|It is a soundtrack that I understand. With that in mind I was dissapointed overall with album. I'm glad the movie was killer.
B00AFEXRME|4.0|About 20  minutes into the movie, Pilot Whip Whitaker (Washington), a veteran pilot flying a plane that suffers a catastrophic malfunction, first saves the plane through heroic efforts (thus saving hundreds of lives) and then is forced to crash land. This whole scene is HARROWING beyond comprehension.<br />The movie opens with explicit nudity and drug use. Preboarding his flight, Whip is totally loaded. So after the crash, the investigation procedures produce test results showing intoxication and presumed impairment. Thus, the stage is set for a legal and moral battle.<br />There is MUCH drug and alcohol use in this movie. There is nudity but no sex. All the acting is very good. This movie is not for children.<br />BOTTOM LINE, DENZEL WASHINGTON IS A STAR. His ACTING ABILITY is ENORMOUS. That was more than evident with another SPECTACULAR PERFORMANCE. I will give the movie 4 stars, but Mr. Washington's performance is 5 star.<br />This movie is not for everyone. Like I said before, there is NUDITY and EXPLICIT DRUG and ALCOHOL use/abuse.
B00A3NQNUU|4.0|I love it incredibly! The only thing is that you can only link it to a Facebook account, and not just make one. That would be nice but other than that, this is a great time waster machine-thingy
B0085P2Z6E|4.0|Very good HO game. The story line is very simple, maybe to simple. Not many twist or turns. The artwork is solid if not outstanding. The game has a mix of &quot;find the difference&quot; and jigsaw puzzles mixed in with the HO boards. Interface is very simple and straight forward. For 99 cents its a good value and worth spending a few minutes a day playing. I recommend it.
B000PC0SPU|5.0|This was recommended to me in an Information Technology Training Course. This gives a different perspective on how our minds work and how it affects our future. This is very easy to read and has a lot of helpful references and activities at the end of each section. I love technology but the right brain will rule in spite of us!!
B002MQYOFW|5.0|What a easy read!! Always held my attention! I truly enjoyed reading it and can't wait to start the next one and  see what happens!
B004R63MWQ|5.0|Awesome world to imagine!! Really enjoyed it. I hope they find a way to make another. Definitely a great rental.
0385738773|5.0|My 11 year old who felt the Kill order was a bit much really enjoyed this one. He flew through it at his normal breakneck pace!
B0060ZJ7BC|5.0|This was a gift for my niece.  She had it on her wish list and was thrilled to get it.
B00AIQP9DE|5.0|great game kids loved it but demo too short thought about buying it so the kids can play the full version
B002VPE1B6|5.0|Avatar in Blue Ray is a great looking movie.  I really enjoyed it and would recommend it to anyone wanting to see this movie in this format.
B008476HBM|5.0|It was easy to download and read. I like having both physical and electronic copies if I can. It was convenient to read because of accessibility on my phone or tablet. Anywhere I got stuck waiting I could start up the book again. Of course the story is a classic too, read it because its my now fianc&eacute;e's favorite and I was brushing up for ideas before my own proposal!
B004Q7CIFI|5.0|Nice blend of history and time travel. Long but won't be disappointed. For us baby boomers a trip back in time
0385742886|4.0|This was a bit disturbing for my 11 year old. He is a huge reader so for him to say that it must have been.
B004EPZ070|5.0|This was a gift for my niece.  She had it on her wish list and was thrilled to get it.
B0063M22QO|3.0|I haven't gotten to a board I couldn't complete yet....but there are lots more to do.  Just haven't had<br />the time.
B004E547D8|4.0|As movies go, this is a good one, and anything on Blue Ray is ok my my opinion.therefore I guess I can recommend it.
B009YP9L7U|5.0|This was a very good book and the relationship of Megan and Connor was simply amazing I was simply amazed at the progression of Megan and Connor from the agreement to the love I recommend this book to anyone who wants a very good book to not only read but to remember and learn from
B009JTCBLE|4.0|I have been a fan of BCC since I saw Live Over Europe on TV.  Love the old classic rock sound, again!  And thanks to Glenn Hughes, he is a master!  The songs here are very good but I think they would have an even better edge if the other three members did more writing.  Joes' playing here is top notch. I want to say I like listening to his lead playing here more than with his recent solo stuff. Glenn's vocals are great as usual!  Jason is solid and adds a driving force behind the songs.  Hated to read a few days ago that they will likely not be going on tour because of Joe and his management's agreement in the beginning of the band.  His solo work is getting stale in my opinion, good songs but no flight!  I think he would help his career more by giving it a rest and focus more with BCC.

B005ZOBNOI|5.0|A must read!! It will make you take a step back on your own life and take a look around.
B0087IT8FK|5.0|This ones a sleeper. It shows you how stereotypes are broken if you just treat people how you want to be treated. All of us are the same inside. You gotta see this.
B005LAIH4A|4.0|This showed up on a lightening deal and I was able to snag it for 3.99. I am very pleased with my purchase. Thanks for the great deal!
B000KFB4PK|5.0|my granddaughter loved this watch - she is only 8 so it took her awhile to figure it out, but she got it together and has been wearing it.
B005CRQ4GU|5.0|This is the best diary ever that I've read.it  trumps the others I mean well you'll just have to reed it.
B0082Z1CVQ|5.0|I never had the chance to read this book while in my younger years, like most girls do, but at the age of 22 I still feel as if this book can inspire women at any age as they transition through the various phases of womanhood.
B0085P2Z6E|4.0|This game consist of not only hidden objects but matching, puzzles, and find the difference levels. The draw back is the zooming, while you are capable to do it it counts as an attempt and penalizes you for it. Other than that great game.
0060536160|5.0|Grandmother tells her grandson how to recognize a witch, what he should do if he sees one, how he can avoid being taken by a witch. The grandson listens carefully and keeps watch. She almost makes me believe there are witches. The grandson does have an encounter with not one witch but an entire conference room full of them. He is turned into a mouse. He is a clever boy and is able to escape. Instead of being depressed that he is now a mouse, he and grandma hatch a plan to put the witches out of business for good. He is the one with the ideas and Grandma is always amazed at his cleverness and helps him carry out his plan.<br /><br />Another boy was also changed into a mouse. His parents are disgusted by him now that he is a mouse. Grandma is very sad that his parents don't love him just because he's a mouse. But Grandma continues to be loving and considerate. She re arranges the house so her grandson/mouse can be safe and independent. She carries him in her purse when they go out. The adventure with the witches is funny and clever but the real story was in the tenderness between Grandmother and Grandson. As the boy/mouse considers his new reality he asks her how long a mouse would live. She is honest as well as hopeful. A mouse does not live as long as a boy would. But he isn't an ordinary mouse so he will live longer than an ordinary  mouse.<br /><br />I liked Roald Dahl before but this book sealed him as one of my favorite authors.
B007TMON8M|4.0|As an engineer, I really appreciate this thinking man's game. It does actually take a bit of critical thought on how to appropriately build a sufficient structure to complete each goal. Basic understanding of geometry helps. As such, I'd say this game is best suited for 12 and older.<br /><br />My only real complaint is that it doesn't take all too long to zoom through all of the levels, thus decreasing the utility of the app. I've probably put about 5-7 hours into it trying to get on each leaderboard & continuously beat my own score.<br /><br />To the review that brought up some variance using the exact same design over and over with some failing and then immediately passing on repeat---I'm wondering if this game has some background wind, etc, effects that you aren't knowingly exposed to up front.  I've noticed the same deal a few times, and that's the only reason I can figure.<br /><br />All in all, I feel this is a very solid 4 star title and a welcome variance from button mashers and finger dragging games.
B005OCFGTO|5.0|My husband was thrilled when he opened this gift on Christmas. He had been asking for it for quite awhile. It arrived on time and in perfect condition.
B008JMKN4Y|5.0|Good story & characters. Loved the ending. My 17 year old niece is now going to borrow my kindle so she can read it.
B009JBZH54|5.0|Great trilogy. Great value. Everything is much clearer when watching it on a blue ray disc. Better picture and sound quality
B00AMBK0X4|2.0|Mark Wahlberg has stooped pretty low - I love comedy, but this was just strange.  There was way too much emphasis on drug usage.
B009UX2YAC|1.0|subway surfed is the worst game ever.if I could I would sue them.I think that because they take my money to give it to people and they deleted my game!
B0054JZC6E|3.0|It is fun but you have to unlock or buy all the games but 10of them. I still don't have them all.
B00AQ3K8IU|5.0|This book, although written from a teenager's point of view, is very well written and engaging. The characters have some very odd quirks and are very entertaining.<br /><br />I didn't think it could be that great, but I have been misled. There is a reason why this book is really good and it does really set the bar for Mature teenage books.
B00992CF6W|5.0|This game is so cool and EPIC I have been playing it ever since I had it&hellip;&hellip;<br /><br />U SHOULD GET THIS APP NOW AND THAT'S  THAT<br /><br />Have fun playing with it :)<br /><br />GET THIS APP NOW!
B002SS8S7E|4.0|We enjoyed the movie, rented it from Amazon Prime.  My review is in regard to the streaming quality of the rental, which was very poor.  We rent frequently from Amazon Prime and the past 2 rentals have been glitchy and lagging.  Frustrating to watch.
B008P1EWIM|4.0|Does the job well with no frills. The app gives enough data to be useful while staying simple to use and attractive to look at.

B00AQ3K8IU|5.0|I try to only read books that I don't have to *think* with (I just don't have it in me to concentrate, I use reading to wind down and escape lol)  But this book was well beyond that.  It was one of those books that really resonated with me in a way that I needed and didn't even know I needed.  I am sure that I will carry the messages I took from it for a very long time.
B009WO7NQO|5.0|Love the characters and the sounds. I can't pick a favorite character because I love them all with their cool actions.
B0070Y46UY|4.0|I had not seen the movie trailer before reading this book. After reading it, I might not see the movie due to the amount of disturbing animal suffering :/ I'm am still curious to see how they would get around this constant suffering to satisfy movie standards of the US.
B00A0A6F7C|5.0|I always knew Susan Boyle had an incredible voice! The first time I heard her sing, I loved listening to her and knew her star would shine! I liked her previous albums, but Standing Ovation just had me awestruck! I actually love every single song on the album! She covered some of my favorite songs of all time...Over the Rainbow, Memory...both of these songs I have never really liked by anyone other then Barbra Streisand...that is until now! Susan you sound Incredible!!!!<br />I love the duet with Donny Osmond, This is the Moment....it sounds like this was written for you both to sing!!!!!<br />When I heard Out Here On My Own, I had chills! This song has never sounded so beautiful. It was sung with so much emotion and a certain vulnerability...this should be a signature song for Susan!<br />I really love this album! Buy it!!! Listen to the samples!!!! You won't regret it! I love every single song!!!!!!!!<br />Thank you Susan Boyle!!! This is very rare to have such a diverse selection of music and for every song to sound like they are totally your songs!!! Bravo!!!!!
B007IXWL2C|5.0|I have read the whole series and loved them. while this book is similar to the others, i still couldn't put it down
B009WO7NQO|4.0|Beware of the addictive nature of this game. I had to give it a break or let my house cleaning fall completely to the curb. You'll love it if you love Angry Birds.
B0064X7FVE|3.0|don't use it a lot.  Works okay when I need it. My Android supports it very well but do not like some applications.
B00AHSMDQY|3.0|Nice action but not the character I grew up on. If he heard of Bane and knew he had to come up against him, he would've done more thorough research on him and would not have just walked into his hideout and been trapped as easily. I know his first meeting with Bane was not a good one since he got beat pretty bad and he's had a tough time with him but I just don't see it going that way. Also, he and Alfred would never hide anything from each other, no matter what happened. Nor would they split like that. Decent movie but not the hero I know.
B0044CBMVG|5.0|I love bones.That is one of the best tv shows ever.<br />I would recommend it to any one that loves science and crime<br />solving shows.
B00AIQP9DE|1.0|not free.  open a gift now take away.  deceptive practice.  a flat out lie not free only plots to get you to buy
B007IXWKUK|5.0|have read teh whole series.  while each book has some similarities, there are some twists as well.  couldn't put it down
B009WO7NQO|5.0|Angry Birds is really fun to play! The game makes you not want to set it down because you just have to kill those minion pigs!!!!
B009NQKXYK|3.0|A missing piece in Ridley Scott's portfolio is found in Prometheus. As a standalone work, it will be found lacking. As the prologue to an epic story, its place is well understood and should not be judged separately.
B003JTHXOK|5.0|This book is amazing! It is definitely a book that will tug on your heart in all different directions. I can't wait to see the movie.
B004HO6I4M|5.0|we love Rio, we watch it often.<br />I would  recommend this movie to any one that has children<br />or is a kid at heart.
B00AMBLDEE|1.0|I liked the actor, but a mediocre follow on. For me actors were okay, story fell flat. Can't just wreck cars, fire some weapons and call it a movie...oh wait...Skyfall did the same thing!
B003O86FMW|5.0|read the whole series.  like the twists in the storeis. while many say this is a 'teen' book, i would recommend for any age range higher as well
B0094BB4TW|1.0|Really disappointed in Amazon with this one.  For all the technology out there and money spent<br />they cannot get a Facebook App to run properly?  Really???<br />Downloads fine and opens fine, but you get the first 5-10 news feeds then stops loading<br />Hope they find a fix soon, really no need for this happen
B005LAIH4A|5.0|Such a vibrant film. Watched with sons 8&4, and husband too. Great story line executed flows all the way never boring and has fantastic underlying message for anyone who might be even a little concerned where this Earth is headed for their children and their childrens children. Little bit of a tear jerker but completely worth every penny spent. Dr.Seuss would be so proud at the modern make of his original story.Every family should get a copy of this movie.

B0034G4OYK|5.0|I absolutely LOVE this movie!! I think it is the cutest and funniest movie for kids this year. I love Adam Sandler and his movies, but I wasn't exactly sure how it was going to turn out because all his movies are filled with a lot of profanity. I was extremely happy to learn there was none in this movie. The story line was great and both my daughter and I were laughing throughout the entire movie. This is a wonderful movie for all ages. I would definitely recommend this to anyone.
B00910Y1OQ|4.0|i dont usually play many casual games but my wife got this game and we share our amazon account and she had me try it and now im hooked! i find having goals and suprise items makes this more replayable than bejeweled!
B00A77II0U|5.0|Just finished the game.  Excellent story line and images.  Kept me interested the<br /> entire game.  Keep them coming!  One of the best HO games out THERE!
B0063IH60K|5.0|I have several versions of solitaire and find this one to be clear and so far without bugs.  Just got a a Kindle Fire and it looks very nice.
B002XHNMVM|4.0|A smart read about an enormously important topic -- education -- but it goes even further to talk about literally &#34;the meaning of life&#34; and how everyone can find that truth at any age. Must read for teachers and parents.
B005RJ6AIK|5.0|Loved the movie and this CD.  If you enjoy the music of the Islands you will enjoy this CD and the variety..
B00993FEUK|2.0|I took my daughter to see this movie in the theatre. Even though it's rated PG, I didn't think anything of it until I started watching it. Within the first 5 minutes of the movie, my jaw dropped when Norman told his mother he was watching a movie about sex and violence. Then to hear the profanity sprinkled throughout the movie. Granted, it wasn't a lot, but I would have expected better for a movie geared towards kids. My daughter keeps asking me about getting the movie, but I won't buy it. The message that it portrays about not judging people is a good message, but I do not like movies that are geared towards kids and have profanity in it, or references to sex. Also, my daughter likes to watch movies so much that within a day or two she knows every line in that movie. I don't like keeping her from watching her movies, but this is one that I would have to restrict heavily due to the profanity, which is another reason why I will not buy it, no matter how much she asks me.<br /><br />The violence was mild and my daughter wasn't scared, so that was never an issue. There were also some funny parts, but it really could have been made a lot better than it was. I've seen other reviews (not for this movie) that ParaNorman was better than Frankenweenie. I definitely have to disagree, but that is just my opinion. I love Frankenweenie and have already pre-ordered it.
B00913DPW2|2.0|I am a bit perplexed by all of the raving reviews of this game.  I found it to be lovely to look at and easy to navigate, but the puzzles were tedious and annoying(although still beautiful to look at).  There was one good real spooky part(not the ghost!), but other then that, not much in the way of spookiness.  The constant chatter about \\"I need to be careful, I feel a presence\\" was contrived and never felt very scary.  All this to say, I wish I could get my money back on this one.  I far preferred Voodoo Whisperer and Enigmatis to this visually pleasing dud.
B0053O89WY|5.0|The dialogues are excellent and their acting is superb. I can say the same of the other &#34;Big Bang Theory&#34; seasons.
B005G5PPGS|5.0|Michael Lewis captures everything about Billy Beane and other GMs in such a well written novel, it is one of my favorite books ever<br />I encourage everyone to read this book.
B005LAJ16I|5.0|An amazing show! Great storyline and acting. You'll be hooked within 1-2 episodes. Best Show of 2011...by far!!!! Give it a try.
B00886XQO0|4.0|So the 2012 post Christmas sale has the Turtle Beach Tango priced at $199. Yes, 33% off the price they were at just earlier this month! That is a HUGE benefit. Plus they came to my home in 2 days when I chose ground shipping. But this post is about the headsets, not the awesomeness of Amazon.com.<br /><br />I am a proud owner of the Turtle Beach Tango and the Turtle Beach X41 (an older flagship model before the Bluetooth pucks were introduced). I plan to keep this review pretty simple so as to help you avoid getting eye fatigue. lol so here goes...<br /><br />Durability and Weight:<br />I love my X41s. They sound great, fit great, are lightweight - unfortunately that lighter weight gives them a cheap feel - but they are very durable against drops and being sat on. The Tango headsets feel sturdier than the X41, but they also feel a bit heavier. If you are not coming from the older headsets, you won't know the difference - ignorance is bliss. Overall, I believe that these will turn out to be just as durable as the X41s or more.<br /><br />Sound:<br />The sound is improved on the Tango. The bass is a bit tighter, as it should be for the added cost. The Bluetooth dongle works very well. Chat is nice and clear, even when I walk 20 feet away into the kitchen to make a drink between BO2 matches. Here is a big one: No popping or static - something that was all too familiar on the X41 (they only ran on the 2.4GHz frequency). With these, they can run on the 5GHz frequency - your microwave and other household appliances run on 2.4, so they never interfere with the signal on the Tangos. This, for me, is a huge improvement. Even when you get out of range, there is no popping, the sound just blanks out. Sucks when it happens, but let me tell you, its better than loud pops going off in your ear. Also note that out of the box they have a \\"loud sound guard\\" on. They don't go up that loud in order to protect your ears. You can turn this off. You can make other adjustments too. I won't go over them. Do your own research and read the manual when you buy them. Also use Google - it's your friend.<br /><br />*Note that the pair that I received had a defect - the master volume (which is separate from the Bluetooth chat volume - a huge plus!) stopped working a few times in a few days. At $200 (retail $300), they are too expensive to overlook any defects out of the box. I am returning them now for a new pair. I am not taking stars away for that. It happens with every line of products and does not take away from the quality of the product.<br /><br />Size:<br />This is the one area that I am not happy with, and where the Turtle Beach Tango loses a star. The Tangos are a bit bigger than the X41. Both headbands can be extended pretty far, so I have not clue as to why they have made this headset's shortest length larger than they previously did.  They sit almost 2 inches lower than the X41s. The X41s literally had a \\"perfect\\" fit. The ear cushions fully surrounded my ears and sat perfectly with little adjustment. The Tangos sit lower so that the top of the cushion sits on the top of my ear and the bottom of the cushion sits on my earlobe and below my ear. This makes the set feel clunky and heavy on my head. Maybe if you never had the X41, you won't notice or care - you will think they are supposed to be an on-ear cushion possibly. But imho, this is the set's one and only flaw.  I am 31 years old. I am 6 foot 1. I weigh 210lb. I do not have a small head. These Tangos are large on my head - period. I can only imagine that a teenager or kid will have even more discomfort wearing this headset. Case in point - Turtle Beach, why change something if it isn't broken??? Make the headset smaller and equally allow a good range of extension. The way it is now, you could wear a sombrero and extend these things down to your ears. They are too large out of the box on the shortest length setting. I don't wear a sombrero. Minus one star.<br /><br />Conclusion:<br />I likethis set. I love the Bluetooth dongle. I am very irritated by the size of the headset. I will continue to use them even if the new set I ordered feels a little big. You can get used to it, but coming from the X41 does make it harder. For that reason, I will NOT be selling my Turtle Beach X41s. Nothing wrong with having 2 sets of surround sound headsets. Plus the X41s fit on my son's head much better than the Tangos with the headband on the shortest length setting. Chain link them via optical cable, directly from the TV, and you're all set.<br /><br />I hope my review was helpful to you. Thanks for reading, and enjoy your new headset if you get them!
B00AQKEPMI|5.0|My daughter and I absolutely LOVE this movie! I liked the fact that Santa Claus was portrayed differently than how he is usually portrayed in movies. I also liked how all the different characters came together to save the world from the Boogeyman. It had a lot of laughs, which is always good to have in a movie. I loved the story of how Jack Frost came to be who he was. This is a great family movie for all ages to be watched and enjoyed for years to come.
B000SW4DXK|5.0|This movie is a classic. I found a deal and bought three, one for me and two for gifts.  Everyone loved it! Good movies never get old.
B0086700CM|4.0|The only problem I have with this app is that if I slide upwards for jumping it sometimes mistake it as a turn or sliding and vice versa. It gets really annoying whenever you're so close to beating your own high score or something like that. If this could be solved, I will rate it to a five star. Thanks!
B00AQ3K8IU|5.0|I love the how your pulled in and fall in love with the characters. The writing is amazing and once you start u can't put it down. Truly a heart felt book but not one that makes you do the ugly cry just a down right good love story . This author does nothing but produce amazing books!
B005LAII80|5.0|Almost 30 years ago, Judge Dredd inspired one of the best action films of all time: ROBOCOP. This year, he got the movie he has long deserved. DREDD is unbridled white-knuckle intensity and unapologetically violent. It is the purest action movie of the year, recalling what made action classics of the past so damn enjoyable.
B00A7Z8KAU|4.0|this app has all the major functionality found in desktop sketch and paint programs with the added convenience of portability.<br /><br />I initially was skeptical of being able to do any decent detail and color work without the ability to control pressure and precision like a pc program paired with a digital drawing tablet.  But after working with the app for a while I am surprised at how close I can get to pc quality work.<br /><br />I was initially going to purchase a stylus but have actually gotten quite good using just my finger.<br /><br />there are a couple of things I wish the program had or did better.  I miss the ability to draw fitted bezier curves.  the canvas size can't be customized.  changing the brush size and opacity seems to take 1 step too long for such a heavily used function.<br /><br />version reviewed: 2.5.2<br />device used on: kindle fire hd 7
B00A8KJN14|5.0|I am a big fan of Tim Burton and love all the movies of his that I have seen. I took my daughter to see this when it was in the theatre. I don't worry to much about her seeing \\"scary\\" movies because they don't bother her. Although I wasn't surprised, I thought it was interesting that it was made in black and white (even Corpse Bride has some color to it, although not much), but I still liked it. I've never seen the original so I can't compare whether once was better than the other.<br /><br />I've seen some reviews where they noted references to other movies within this one (Coraline, Beetlejuice, etc.). I hadn't noticed, but I wasn't paying attention to that. Besides, why would anyone be surprised. Tim Burton is quirky and has a tendency to do that with some of his movies, so it's really no surprise.<br /><br />I've been waiting for this one to come out because I know that my daughter will love to have it. It is definitely worth it to have as a family movie!
B0087GJ8KM|5.0|\\"This is a book about sales. But it is unlike any book about sales you have read (or ignored) before. That's because selling in all its dimensions--whether pushing Buicks on a car lot or pitching ideas in a meeting--has changed more in the last ten years than it did over the previous hundred.\\" (Daniel Pink, taken from the book)<br /><br />Drew Tewell, author of [[ASIN:B0099K5KKC The Dream Job Program: Get the job you want.]]
B00AKCJB44|5.0|Love it, just love it. It went great with the movie so getting the album just added to my happiness. Woot
B00AHSIQWE|2.0|The dark knight was a definitive film. This follow up was terrible. It dragged. Lacked excitement...luster....glitz like the others. In fact I would say this was less entertaining than the original tv series! And that's bad.
B00AIQP9DE|5.0|A must have game. Worth the time and money. Great graphics and story. Play it over and over again and it still just as fun.
B00062PN6I|5.0|Ordered the first time and it didn't work.  Ordered a replacement with no hassle and it's been working ever since!
B00A7OIXW6|5.0|This looked like it was going to be a cute movie when I saw the previews for it on TV and I was right! One of the best original movies Disney has come out with in a while. It had a lot of funny parts and definitely made you root for the good guys (Wreck-It Ralph and Vanillapea). My daughter loved it and I can't wait for it to come out so that she can watch it at home.
B0047Y0FGY|3.0|Not what I expected, Tina is hilarious but as I am a 23 yr old non mother there are some things I haven't quite experienced to find funny, yet I think my mom would definitely get a kick out of the parenting and generational humor.
B00AIQP9DE|5.0|This is a very fun game. Works well on Kindle Fire. The free part ends about halfway through the game, but the paid game is worth the money spent. I love puzzlers. The game looks great too. I definitely recommend if you like puzzle adventures.
B007SGLZP8|4.0|Pretty good read!  Lots of twists and turns.  Gotcha at its best.  I always enjoy John Grisham.  Never run of the mill.
B007SGLZP8|5.0|Have not read Grisham in a while,  have to say this will bring me back to reading.  exciting, riveting until the very end.
B009S8PEHY|5.0|Rod Stewart has given us a great new sound while keeping with the holiday traditions. I enjoyed this recording and recommended to my friends.
B009UX2YAC|4.0|It is a great deal and a great game.But the description is bad because they say the inspector and his pitbull. That insults pit bulls! Why?  =) = good game.
B008QTVNUI|3.0|Homeland begins with an incredible premise: a US soldiers returns after years of captivity and rumors abound that he has been \\"turned\\" into a terrorist.  It's a great setup and the first few episodes keep you guessing.<br />But as the show gets closer to its end things start to come apart.  I'm trying to avoid spoilers so I will be as vague as possible.  The show does a good job of keeping it's secrets but the big reveal as the end is a disappointment.  Character's actions just aren't justified by the plot and their motivations don't work.  It removals all the emotional weight from the things they do.<br /><br />I also feel that the ending was hamstrung by the desire to make this a recurring series.  It could have been a fantastic 1 season series but the decisions to stretch things out for another year really hurts this show.  The nature of this show called for 1 season, an amazing season, but just one.  Now I feel like I have to watch another year of posturing just to see what should have happened in year 1.<br /><br />After seeing the whole thing I'm not sure it was worth the purchase.  Try to watch it on TV or borrow it from someone.  I own it now but I have little desire to watch it again.
0061537934|5.0|I read alot and this book was recommended to me by my veterinarian. Glad she did. Though the book was sad at times, it was definately for any animal lover who believes that their pet has come back to them in some form or another. FANTASTIC!!!!

1616960922|4.0|The imprisoned Shai attempts to Forge a new soul for a brain damaged Emperor in the stand alone novel \\"The Emperor's Soul\\".  The author creates another marvelous magic realm where an individual with a certain and illegal skill set may imprint or recreate an items history, such as a stuck and abused door may have a symbol placed on it such it will open smoothly and have a gleaming finish.  While it is a fairly quick novel, it provides a satisfying level of entertainment and could be a foundation for future novels or a series.<br /><br />Thank you.
B007SGLZP8|4.0|Great add to my Grisham library.  Doesn't have that classic legal thriller grab you by the throat Grisham start; otherwise classic Grisham, very good and entertaining.
B0095ZMMCK|5.0|Fast paced action - fun read - not as much technology as previous novels.  The romance story line contrived and improbable
B006K1IIHA|5.0|I loved Moffett's work in Couplings, heard he was good in Doctor Who, and got blown away with his Holmes treatments. That was only the basis that they built the best Holmes ever.  The actors are the icing that makes this the most watchable Holmes of all time. I want more and more and more.  Come on Steven get cracking.

B006LSZECO|3.0|I have to say that I gave this book 3 stars, almost exclusively, because I think Flynn is a phenomenal writer.  I happened upon Flynn by accident (looking for a decent `suspense/thriller' type book for an upcoming trip).  She had good reviews, so I downloaded Dark Places.  Dark Places, along with Gone Girl, have such well defined characters, and Flynn's writing style - I am not sure what it is - but, it pulls you into the story and into the characters.  That, to me, is key for any good book.  I looked forward to reading this book, primarily because of Go, the twin sister.  I'm a twin and a big fan of anything with twins...kinda hooky, but, it'll get me every time.<br /><br />Gone Girl was semi-predictable.  The twist everyone speaks/writes of, was anticipated, at least for me.  Maybe not to the degree I had expected, but it was still there.  Regardless, I was hooked on the story line and \\"what would happen\\"...<br /><br />To avoid any spoiler, I will just say that I was disappointed in the end (as I was with Dark Places).  Flynn, and her fluid writing style, kept me reading to find out what happened...it was great...and then, all of a sudden, there was a huge wrap up of the story, and a very strange ending.  An ending that I ultimately had to do a Google search on to see if I missed something.  Apparently, I did not.  Either that - or, Flynn is leaving it open for a sequel.  It is doubtful that I would read any sequel.<br /><br />Disappointed with the end of Gone Girl, disappointed with Dark Places.  I won't read another story to be disappointed.
B004SJ3BCI|5.0|Nice and entertaining. Looks great on my Kindle Fire. There is something really fun and childish in the whole concept and it really appeals to me.

B005HJU7HA|4.0|I started watching BBC's production of &#34;Sherlock&#34; and I realized I had never read the books.  I'm enjoying Sir Conan Doyle's stories very much.
B00AQ3K8IU|5.0|I pretty much fell in love with this story right away! I was intrigued with Holder right from the start and he never disappointed. Sky & Holder's relationship from the beginning was worth reading about. All the twist and turns in the book had be literally biting my nails to see what was coming next. I am usually a good predictor on whats going to happen before it does, but Hopeless totally left me wondering the whole time. You would be crazy not to give this book a try!!!!!
0385472951|3.0|The Partner is Patrick Lanigan, one of five partners from a Gulf Coast law firm, who faked his death and absconded with $90 million.  He left behind a grieving widow, a child, and four angry partners of the former Bogan, Rapley, Vitrano, Havarac and Lanigan law firm, not to mention a client named Benny Aricia, who was also out $60 million - the money Patrick stole less the portion due to the law firm for their representation in the case.<br /><br />Once Patrick is found, many of these people are lining up for their pound of flesh.  The people who found him had tortured him for information about the money, but their gestapo questioning tactics were abruptly halted by United States government authorities, who were informed of his capture almost immediately after it occurred.  There are some questions about how the investigator Jack Stephano finally found his man, but the real questions concern Patrick Lanigan.<br /><br />There are moments of danger in the story.  An accomplice of Lanigan, the beautiful Eva Miranda, becomes the target of Jack Stephano's surveillance, because Stephano's firm suspects that she knows the whereabouts of the missing money.  Her father Paulo, is briefly kidnapped for a while, in order to get to Eva.  The FBI is building a case against Patrick Lanigan, who hires an old friend, Sandy McDermott, to represent him.  Actually, Eva hires Sandy at the request of Patrick.  Lanigan and McDermott work to cut the best deal that they can, and they also try to protect Eva and her father from trouble.<br /><br />By the end of the story, the reader actually feels sorry for Patrick, particularly after the downbeat ending. The reader quickly abandons any sympathy for Trudy, his widow.  It is harder to explain away his disappearance from his daughter, Ashley Nicole, but there is even a reasonable explanation for that.  Nor does one feel sorry for his old law partners, whose lives are in shambles because their firm bet their capital on the outcome of the Aricia case.<br /><br />Most of the details of the real story - how Lannigan bilked his law firm and their client out of $90 million - come while he is in custody.  Since most of the details come when Lannigan appears safe, The Partner isn't the type of page-turning novel that John Grisham is most notable for producing.  The story isn't a bad one, but it's not as compelling as Grisham's other novels of the \\"legal thriller\\" genre.case.<br /><br />Most of the details of the real story - how Lannigan bilked his law firm and their client out of $90 million - come while he is in custody.

B00A0SKFLG|4.0|Good movie, much closer to the PK Dick novel than the original. Farrel and Beckinsale were great, Beil was a little vanilla but overall was a good movie. Closer to hard science fiction than the original, which had more comedy and fluff.
B005VPRETE|5.0|I have always loved playing with Lego as a kid and as an adult too. Love that they have finally come out with ones just for girls - saves me a lot of time when deciding over presents for my nieces :)
B0063GORYU|5.0|I love any solitaire game. Spider is one of the best.  I love that if I get stuck there is a hint button to go to.  I give this game a solid 10.
0312323867|4.0|I absolutely loved this second book. Great strategy to tell the second half of the story through Darcy's perspective. Darcy had transformed to where I was rooting for her to find true love. Realistic and unexpected story of friendship and love. Easy read, and compelling character to make this a quick one for me too.  After finishing I almost think this second one may have been better than the first book.  Great pairing nonetheless.
B009YP9L7U|5.0|This is the first book I've read by this author, and my first Harliquin book and  I thoroughly enjoyed it!  I loved the characters, they were both charming and funny and well developed. I will definitely look for other books by this author!
0345536886|4.0|The topic of The Litigators, John Grisham's legal thriller based in Chicago, involves a mass-tort claim, which he explored in [[ASIN:034553199X The King of Torts]], and, to a lesser degree in a few other novels.  His prior novel looked at mass-torts from the large firms that pursued such legal work, while this novel covers the business from the point of view of a small, local firm.  The frame of reference makes The Litigators similar to the story in [[ASIN:044022165X The Rainmaker]], where a rough-and-tumble urban law office barely getting by stumbles upon a few cases that could make them very wealthy.<br /><br />The southwest side of Chicago is the gritty setting, with its own cast of colorful characters.  The firm is located somewhere west of Comiskey Park and somewhere north of Midway Airport.  The stated location of the firm, at the intersection of Preston, Beech and 38th Street, is one that does not exist.  In trying to capture the grittiness of a city that he feels is essential to the novel, Grisham distracts the reader by not knowing Chicago very well.  He cites a drive from Rogers Park to the Navy Pier in twenty minutes and other impossible trips that cannot be made in the time specified.<br /><br />The primary characters are Wallis Figg, a junior partner is a two-firm ambulance-chasing legal outhouse, and David Zinc, a corporate lawyer once specializing in high-yield, long-term corporate bonds.  Zinc, in a moment of self-introspection at the end of a beer glass, quit his job, citing boredom, malaise, and long-term dissatisfaction, and wrangled his way into the two-lawyer boutique law firm of Finley & Figg.<br /><br />The senior partner of the legal outhouse is Oscar Finley.  Oscar the Grouch, Wally Figg, and their office manager Rochelle Gibson get by, making enough money for a living while keeping the firm afloat.  David Zinc becomes part of the dysfunctional quartet by wielding wreckage from an auto crash to keep a competing lawyer from soliciting the victims.  All four are flawed characters but interesting enough for a reader to care about them.<br /><br />Spurred on by Wally Figg, the firm stakes its hopes for a profitable year on a tort case involving Krayoxx.  Krayoxx is a drug that claims it can help a user lose weight, but some people believe it causes problems with the heart.  Figg hopes to piggyback on the efforts of Zell & Potter, a Florida mass-tort specialist firm that has filed a prominent, similar lawsuit against Varrick Labs, a pharmaceutical behemoth in Montvale, NJ that produces Krayoxx.<br /><br />What seems as a case that will be settled out of court becomes a legal mismatch, when Varrick Labs hires Nadine Karros of Rogan Rothberg to try the case filed by Finley & Figg.  Nadine is straight from the archives of 48 hours: a beautiful, successful prosecuting district attorney with a magnificent courtroom presence.  In another similarity to The Rainmaker, Rogan Rothberg is the old firm of David Zinc, using the David against Goliath angle in the courtroom with a personal touch.<br /><br />The protagonists and villains are not obvious, but they are cleverly-dressed and easy enough to draw the reader into the story.  While Grisham reworked the plot of The Rainmaker even better in this novel, he lost something by choosing a location that he did not know very well.
B007PT3QOQ|4.0|Love this game.  Great sound and graphics.  Very fun and kind of addicting.  The only downfall is that it runs a little slow sometimes.
B003TSEEDY|5.0|In the beginning I was a little sceptical, but as the book went on I fell in love. As you get to know Charlie you realize how intelligent and insightful he was. It was a great and adorable book!
B009WO7NQO|5.0|My kids and I like this game very much.  Like the extra weapons each bird has.<br />My son is hooked
0062124293|5.0|Great read from start to finish.Also great approach to the \\"feminist\\" topics by finding her own personal experiences as the core story with great wit. Had me laughing while also reflecting and relating to my own experiences as a woman. Her writing style made it a good casual read and her commentary on her experiences kept me thoroughly entertained.
B000W7JWUA|5.0|This game is a lot of fun. I bought as a gift for someone and they were super excited to receive. Amazon had the best price. I shopped around online for a month and even Ebay could not compete with the price when you consider shipping. It was shipped well and the game was received in prime condition. This is a great family game. I've heard it described as Risk and Monopoly combined.
B00A11AN6O|3.0|Thanks for the capability.  Now it's a learning curve as I just received my Kindle Fire for Christmas and I haven't tried to use this yet.
0425206211|4.0|Lee Child is awesome. I bought this for my husband. I wanted him to read so he knows that Tom Cruise should not be the one playing  Jack Reacher.
B007MDB548|5.0|Five minutes in and my kids were in love. Secret of the Wings is the best Disney Fairies product yet!<br /><br />The film opens with the fairies preparing for winter season. In her typical fashion, Tinkerbell cannot be help but curious about what life is like in the Winter Woods. This sends her down a path of rule breaking that is Tinkerbell's signature. Throughout the trouble, she learns a big secret... the Secret of the Wings. I am not one to drop spoilers, so I will leave it there.<br /><br />This is an excellent short movie that should appeal to both boys and girls. There is no 'villain', so the story is able to unfold without scaring little ones. Also, the addition of the Pixie Hollow games is a nice addition to the package. Quality on Blu Ray is typical of Disney and looks amazing. Outside of the volume being a bit low, it is hard to complain about the quality.<br /><br />Score another win for the Disney Fairies franchise.
B003ZSJ212|5.0|I bought this for my boyfriend for christmas because he loooooveess star wars. Honestly I have never seen any of the episodes.

B004J4WNL2|5.0|Not that I read all of the books in 2012.... This book was well researched, interesting, and relevant. I loved it.
B004U8VWLE|1.0|In the interest of full disclosure I turned this move off about 3/4s through. I was expecting a thriller and got instead a movie about an extremely insecure ballerina, an obsessive controlling mother, a manipulative &#34;friend&#34; and more catty ballerinas than anymovie desrves to feature. I kept waiting for it all to lead to something resembling a thriller but it never came close. Making it worse, it's one of those movies that asks the viewer to suspend credulity and believe that the characters simply accept  ludicrous happenings without question. This is one heck of a pretentious film hiding behind an &#34;artistic&#34; veil.
B000YHG72E|5.0|Top 5 favorite Christmas movies. Had to order second copy after giving first copy away, so happy to have received it in time for Christmas.

B0014BC3C2|4.0|We enjoyed this movie, especially after a second viewing to better understand the synchronization of the subplot with the main events.  And the bonus documentary opened our eyes even more to a troubling aspect of American terrorist policy and practice that was new for us.
B00005BJ2O|5.0|Everyone has seen a version of this film and heard different versions of the music. This version has beautiful costumes and scenes and I love the vibrancy of the whole film .
B0065CCM76|5.0|Time moves on, but classic rock and roll will never be forgotten. Hearing all these great songs of yesteryear brought back such great feelings I thought I would never relive again. Great Album.
B007HACDLK|5.0|I am a big fan of Vince Flynn's books,and was not disappointed with this one.  In fact, it may be his best yet.  If you're looking for a page turner that you can't put down, this is it.

B000I0RNV6|5.0|All I can say is Wow. What a beautiful film about life and passion . This film is a must.
0810983915|4.0|Greg Heffley is addictive.  As soon as I finish one book, I want to immediately start the next one.  Every time he opens his mouth (or pen), I think \\"Yes!  That's exactly what I was thinking!\\"  (Which probably doesn't say much for my mature sense of humor.)<br /><br />The 'dog days' of the title refers to the dog days of Greg's summer vacation.  Grey wants to spend his summer indoors by the TV but his mom has other plans.  Unfortunately, the family has no money so the annual summer family vacation turns into a 'staycation' at the local pool.<br /><br />My favorite part is when Greg starts going to the country club with his best friend Rowly.  He orders dozens of drinks and food stuffs and charges it all to Rowley's dad...while complaining about the service.  So funny!  To pay off Rowley's dad, Rowley and Greg try and start a lawn service.  Greg isn't much for physical labor so the business doesn't last very long but has some hilarious consequences.  The best graphics are the portrayals of the hairy men when Greg has to walk through the YMCA shower room.  The funniest part is when the family accidentally leaves mom at a gas station.  Greg's brothers and the rest of the family are all back--and all still as strange.  In this family, Greg is the best of the bunch.<br /><br />These books do not have to be read in order so jump in anywhere.  But, whatever you, jump all the way in with a big belly flop.  Greg is a hero to really get behind--he is so very fallible, so very human.  He says things I wish I could and does things I've thought about--but my good sense stopped me.  These books are really best for reluctant teen or adolescent readers, though, so don't let the comics make you think it's a little kids read.
B0076DCT2G|3.0|Have been a fan of Nelson DeMille's books for years.  Was disappointed in this one,  found it tedious to read in spite of what could have been a good plot with well developed characters.
0547884591|5.0|Five Books in One<br />This book isn't just about becoming a good chef. This behemoth of a book is actually 5 books. One of the books - the \\"DOM\\" section - is absolutely about how to face your fears about cooking and does an excellent job in breaking down cooking.<br /><br />The first section \\"META-LEARNING\\" is really about how Tim is able to learn all his crazy skills - essentially networking, asking great questions, breaking things down, building frameworks and then translating from one skill to the next. It has nothing to do with cooking, but it's an excellent (and a little bit exhausting) read.<br /><br />The third section \\"WILD\\" is where this book lost me. It jumped from the super basics of cooking to KILLING your own food in the woods. That was a pretty huge leap for me. And, I'm definitely not ready to see the bloody photos of a deer getting butchered. While this section is very useful and beautifully designed, it's for a completely different audience than the first sections.<br /><br />The fourth section, \\"SCI\\" reminds me a lot of 4-Hour-Body. It's about doing really crazy/cool things with food, but gets really technical. Again, I think this section is for a more advanced audience.<br /><br />The last section \\"PRO\\" is also helpful, but it's just as advanced as SCI. I would recommend splitting this book into 3 books - META LEARNING, DOM, and WILD/SCI/PRO.<br /><br />The Design<br />I really enjoyed reading META and DOM. For one, the design is beautiful. While Tim Ferris is clearly a brilliant learner/communicator, the designers he hired should also get some cred. The layout, photos and organization is a major reason this book is such a pleasure to read.<br /><br />Great cooking framework for Beginners<br />In DOM, the best part of the book, is the frameworks that Tim introduces. I love that he breaks it into \\"Prep\\" and \\"Pickup\\" (the two major steps in cooking).  I also love that he takes photos of all the ingredients in each recipe. I also love that he forcesyou to not be super exact, therefore learning the underlying principles of cooking rather than memorizing a recipe. Lastly, I really love that he kicks things off talking about flavors, and using scrambled eggs as a can't-screw-up way of understanding the flavors of the world.<br /><br />More than Four Hours<br />It will take you at least 4 hours to read the book alone, much less implement it. The \\"4-hour\\" title is an amazing value prop that Tim now needs to use to maintain his brand, but it's not accurate in this case. However, Tim DOES break cooking down into steps that make it way so that you can become a great cook in vastly fewer hours than it may have taken otherwise. I also recommend taking a long nap before tackling this book. It's fun, but it's dense and wandering, and often a little overwhelming. Your brain needs to be in tip-top shape to take it on, but it's worth it.
B00992CF6W|5.0|I play it on MC I love it I watch other people do it like IHasCupquake BrenyBeast I totally recommend this to you
B000JQUKKU|5.0|Very well written story. Would recommend this to everyone. I've enjoyed this author for many years. You will have a great adventure with this story.
B004HX0P2Y|5.0|Bruce Willis is right on in this one. It grabs you quickly and doesn't let go. Morgan Freeman and John Malkovich round out a superb supporting cast, and Richard Dreyfuss plays an awesome bad guy!<br />If I'm correct, this is also the last appearance for Ernest Borgnine! Definitely worth a watch.
B008HT4FUW|5.0|I love this series and this was by far the best value for a blu ray edition of season one and season two.
B007GCY8FS|4.0|Good plot, well developed, enough suspense and drama to keep my interest.  Lee Child is a relatively new author for me, and am enjoying his books so far.
B0071XO8RA|5.0|I bought the omnibus edition - being a fan of the apocalypse/dystopian genres and frankly I was blown away.  I could not put this down.  He weaves a fabulous story and has some great characters.  Some you love, some you hate.  I HUNGER for more.  I want to hear about the conspiracies, the other silos, the end of \\"The Order\\"....<br /><br />I also take my hat off to whoever edited the story.  I didnt see any typos or grammatical errors.  I know that sounds picky....but they do bug me and the extra effort leads me to appreciate the overall work on the story.<br /><br />Bravo.  Cant wait for the next!
B00AMBH70S|3.0|I found myself not really interested in what happened to the central character after watching a little over half the movie.
B007BZM3HK|4.0|LOL!!  Love this song, it keeps playing in my head!!  upbeat...love it.  i want to get it as my ring on my iPhone too!
B003XF1XOQ|5.0|As a general rule, I hate \\"Young Adult\\" novels. I was raised on The Hobbit and Treasure Island, and now count the Yellow Sign, the Discworld series and A Game of Thrones among my favorites. Happy Harry Potter and his gang of loveable butterbeer-guzzling rapscallions didn't do Jack for me, and the entire twilight franchise can burn deep in the fires of the seven hells. Upon hearing of the \\"Hunger Games\\" books, I assumed they would be more of the same drek, but I picked this series up on a whim, and was pleasantly surprised to find that the Hunger Games is not only a good read, but smarter than many \\"regular\\" adult novels out there, with a REAL moral message about the  cost of violence and a razor-sharp satire of modern programming and celebrity culture. While the political and moral bits may be a bit over the head of Hunger Games' younger fans, Katniss is still a positive figure, even with a laundry list of faults.  Overall, I highly recommend this series to anyone who can handle some of the more gruesome bits. Don't pass this one up because of the \\"Team Peeta/Gale types.
0446554995|5.0|Great job L&C! The Pendergast books never disappoint me. He is probably one of the only characters (of all time) that I can trust to not make stupid mistakes all throughout a novel. Two Graves had a little bit of everything in it. Wonderful book!!
B00914JWSW|5.0|Barbra at her finest.  I gave this to my sister as a gift, along with &#34;Hello Gorgeous:  Becoming Barbra Streisand&#34;.  She was beyond thrilled!!!
B00009YOQW|5.0|Our 13 month old received this for Christmas, and it's as good as I hoped it would be. The drum is lovely, wooden with nice paint and a well made stick. She is still a little young for it (Plan Toys says 18 mos is ideal for this toy), but she loves making beats already. The sound is pleasant, so even a child's erratic beating is not annoying. I am so glad she has this and imagine we will enjoy playing with it for many years.
B002VRZEYM|5.0|I was surprised to learn how food is produced in this country and that Kevin's Law still has not passed.  The US Govt/US Dept of Ag must strengthen standards to keep our foods safe or more people will lose friends and family members to contaminated food.  We all should play an active role in this change.

B0052UZIFA|5.0|One of the most fun tower defense genre game ever. The concept is simple but the gameplay is phenomenal. Creative designs, enjoyable tunes and music.
1451695195|5.0|Words cannot express how I feel reading this book. Proof of Heaven answered so many questions I have pondered in my life. This book is needed in the world we live in today. It is a must have and a book that I will read over and over again. I am confident that I will discover something new every time I read it. WOW!
B002PEP4SC|4.0|The book definitely ties into how the tv series I'd done<br /><br />The investigation is great and you can almost feel the sexual tension in a good way
B005ZOBNOI|5.0|Holy God. This book is one of only five books I have ever read that tore my world view asunder.
0073398101|3.0|This book is jam packed with a truck load of information, however it's very rarely explained, and the samples are few and far between, roughly one for every 10 formulae.  Also, the numerical symbology is consistent, however if you forgot what 'theta' represents, you'll be looking for a while to find its reference again.  The appendices are difficult to follow if you're without prior knowledge of how they interact.  The book is very thoroughly researched, but isn't a good platform to understand the subject
B003O86FMW|5.0|Freaking amazing! Couldn't put the book down! I can't wait to read the next one to find out what happens!
B004EBZX6W|4.0|It's not a complicated app. Just read the description and see if this is the app you wish to download. I experienced no bugs or force closes.
B0054JZC6E|4.0|this is an awesome starter game for young kids and adults alike. highly recommend. easy to earn points and unlock other games!
B0070Y46UY|3.0|Boring and really to dull to be fun reading. I think that its a good book for early teens and some what younger kids.
B001U0HBPQ|4.0|It was worth the $5 we paid for it. There is quite a bit of adult content so it definitely deserves the pg13 rating.
B001DUJNGS|4.0|I love having Enya, Enigma, and similar bands playing as background music throughout the day.  The album is different than what you are accustomed to from their first five albums, but this music is still enjoyable.  It's nice to see a band reinvent itself every now and then.
B004LWZWGK|4.0|Really enjoyed this movie in the theater and wanted to add it to collection.  What makes me really like this purchase is that it comes with the digital copy that can be copied to an iPod or iPad for viewing when traveling.
B006OCM0G0|5.0|I love games like this so i really like it<br />it relaxes me after along day at work ,<br />try it
B001DM1VXE|5.0|Though it is a bit different than your typical Hollywood blockbuster, Pi gives you a chance to escape into the world of mathematics and how it is involved in all aspects of life, from nature and the stock market, to religion. Since it is so powerful, there are people interested in using it to their advantage, so of course they will do whatever they can to try and figure out the secrets of math to use to their advantage. Though the film is somewhat cheesy at times, I still love the intensity, the thought processes, and the examples used throughout the story. I've seen it about 20 times and still love to watch it ever year or so... I would highly recommend.
B006LSZECO|3.0|Nothing. That's what. The book was great, started off slow and then really grabs you. I found the back and forth style a little hard to follow at first, but became accustomed quickly. There are excellent twists and it definitely keeps your attention... and then it ends. Just like that, with 1000 loose ends and even more unanswered questions. Like getting seconds from climax and zipping up and walking away.... left much to be desired.
B008RZF1UO|5.0|I recently saw these guys play live in Columbus, Ohio, and they played better than one of my favorite bands, Nightwish.  Kamelot's new singer, Tommy Karevik, has an incredibly powerful voice with range like Freddy Mercury. He also sings with another great band, Seventh Wonder.  If you're a fan of metal music you owe it to yourself to add this album to your collection.  I believe these guys are going to be huge in the future.
B00280LYIC|4.0|In this book Percy Jackson is being hunted down by Gods and creatures who accuse Percy for stealing something he didn't take.

B004ZN9YNC|5.0|I have written on my blog, The Rock Traveler, about the difference between albums that are my very favorites and albums I consider to be the best by any one particular artist, band, or performer. The answer for some when posed this question is rarely the same. Bands like Pink Floyd, Fleetwood Mac, U2, Rush, and Van Halen, with such long, prolific careers and such distinct periods (and even lineups) for example, are even more interesting to discuss, dissect, and consider. Pink Floyd has always had such a strong presence in the world of rock and still have one of the most passionate and dedicated followings in music. It is rare to find any two fans that agree on the best work in their catalog and, of course, there is no right answer.<br /><br />I have always maintained that if you enjoy ANY type of music, the emotions and feelings it creates are more important than what I like versus what you like. Additionally, it has been my experience that some of the most lasting and influential works in music history rarely are the result of ideal circumstances and creative harmony. Fleetwood Mac's [[ASIN:B00AGKHEUI Rumours - Expanded Edition (3XCD)]] and Richard and Linda Thompson's [[ASIN:B000000612 Shoot Out the Lights]] are just two examples of musical masterpieces created as the direct result of bands (and relationships) imploding while the tape is running. The Final Cut, Pink Floyd's final proper album from 1983, features their classic lineup (sans Rick Wright) before the acrimonious departure of Roger Waters. Once cited as one of the most depressing albums in history, I have always strongly disagreed with that assertion. The Final Cut is certainly not Pink Floyd's best album. That distinction is a matter of opinion and will forever be  open for debate. It is, however, MY favorite Pink Floyd album, as its music, message, and subtle brilliance continues to reveal, haunt, and entertain me nearly 30 years after its release. It is certainly a dark and highly emotional work that transcends easy comparisons or classification and it rewards the patient listener; especially on vinyl and through headphones.<br /><br />Most Floyd fans would argue that 1973′s Dark Side of the Moon holds the distinction of the band's best and most popular work. The band members themselves also readily admit that it was a creative high water mark for them and an enjoyable time when each member was \\"on side\\" towards the realization of a shared musical vision. The album spent 741 (nearly 15 years) on the Billboard charts and has sold over 50 million copies worldwide since. It is hard to argue with its success or lasting influence; as it is still an achievement in recorded music that never fails to surprise, impress, and reveal additional layers. In fact, Dark Side, and the follow-ups, 1975′s Wish You Were Here and Animals (from 1977) are a trio of albums of such high quality and creativity and complexity that the band's legacy would have been forever cemented had they never recorded anything else.<br /><br />However, like the song \\"Limelight\\" from the classic 1980 Rush release Moving Pictures, the fame, wealth, and acclaim  that come with an album as popular as Dark Side eventually leads to sad times and ultimately darker material.  \\"Limelight\\", like many Rush songs, manages to convey an entire album's worth of message, cynicism, and drama in just one cut. Ironically, the popularity of the song (and album) caused the very problem it detailed. While Pink Floyd stretched a similar message across two unforgettable album sides on Dark Side, the single \\"Money\\" echoes (pun intended) a similar foreshadowing of the impending success of the band and subsequent (and seemingly inevitable) unraveling of Pink Floyd as a functioning group. This ultimate alienation and demise did not receive proper attention again lyrically or thematically from Roger Waters until the epic 1979 release, [[ASIN:B004ZN9W5M The Wall]].<br /><br />The Final Cut was initially intended to be a coda for the songs and issues raised during the recording of The Wall, and as a further clarification of Waters' anti-war message. It was also to be used as a soundtrack to the 1982 movie version of [[ASIN:B0006ZE7G2 Pink Floyd: The Wall (25th Anniversary Deluxe Edition)]] being directed by Alan Parker and starring (Sir) Bob Geldof of Boomtown Rats. Most fans would agree that the main concepts were muddled and lost in the uneven (yet visually striking) movie version of The Wall, which the band (and Waters in particular) were never fully happy with. So, when the war in the Falkland Islands broke out, Waters' instead rewrote The Final Cut from a movie soundtrack and turned it into a scathing review of modern British politics; focusing on the unfulfilled promises of a new era in England after World War II and the high cost the war ultimately had on him personally. Waters father, Eric Fletcher Waters, for whom the album is dedicated, died in Italy in 1944 as an officer in the British Army and is the ever-present ghost that seems to haunt the entire album. A rare and brilliant short film was produced to coincide with the release of the album and only one video, for the album's lone single \\"Not Now John,\\" was made.<br /><br />Already having one of the most impressive visual components to both the band's distinctive album covers and their legendary light shows, Roger Waters chose to eschew the work of long-time collaborators Storm Thorgerson and Aubrey Powell, founding members of Hipgnosis for this release. Remembered best for their work with groups like Led Zeppelin, AC/DC, Yes, U.F.O., and Peter Gabriel, Hipgnosis also created the now iconic design and photography of the Dark Side of the Moon cover, as well as Animals and Wish You Were Here. Design for the album cover on The Final Cut Waters completed himself this time around using photos taken by his brother in law. The cover is of a simple array of war medals on a black background and the inside gate-fold displays various pictures of poppies, a theme also echoed throughout the album's lyrics. Poppies, inspired by the war poem \\"In Flanders Field\\" by John McCrae, have been used as a common remembrance of those who have lost their lives in the line of duty since WW I.<br /><br />The album was also recorded using the then new and experimental Holophonic recording process to give the album the audio equivalent of a 3-D quality . Holophonics was created by Argentinian inventor, Hugo Zuccarelli, and can best be heard on the album in the transitions from one song to another, which feature voices, sound effects, and background noises similar to those used to link songs on The Wall and Dark Side into a thematic whole. A remastered and repackaged CD was released by EMI in Europe and on Capitol Records in the US in 2004; which includes an extra song, the previously unreleased \\"When the Tigers Broke Free\\" appearing just after \\"One of the Few\\". It is a nice song but does disrupt the flow fans of the album may have become accustomed to. As the album is still best heard in one listen from beginning to end the best songs on the disc hold up well when heard with other cuts or \\"Best Of\\" collections.<br /><br />I encourage anyone who has not heard the album to listen patiently and with no expectations so you can decide for yourself. I consider it to be a lost treasure in their discography and therefore, songs that can still be enjoyed as if they were brand new.  However, please make-up your own mind and keep the debate going.or the songs and issues raised during the recording of The Wall, and as a further clarification of Waters' anti-war message.

B00A9C3RB8|5.0|Meryl Streep does it again. Honestly, I found this movie to be delightful. It would really make anyone that has been in a long-term relationship take a good look at themselves!
B009YP9L7U|5.0|I love the way the story was written. Conner Reed is every woman's dream guy. So sly, sweet thoughtful and caring for his wife so much he would do anything to make her happy and protect her. Love the detail about the way he made love to her, great passion. Thanks for a great read.
B00AA0TJO8|1.0|I doesn't even realize when I want to unlock something, the drawing is soo hard and the game is pretty much plain stupid. Your friend gets eaten then you go through really lame courses then u find them and game over. I finnished the game is twenty minutes.  This game deserves zero stars (that should be an option) IT SUCKS!!!!
B006M4F67A|4.0|I had a little trouble getting started, so I asked my grandchildren for help, which they were more than willing to do.  I have had a computor for several years, but thought I should  update my skills.  Buying a Kindle Fire was my first attempt at this.  I'm enjoying it.  Thankyou.
B00004R99U|4.0|This movie is just as good as the first, in my opinion but the love story changes into a love triangle for a little bit etc. it's worth buying if you have the first one.
B0095P33IW|5.0|It is so much fun seeing the beginning of each of the Marvel Avengers characters and finding Stan Lee.  Enjoy!

B007BFSYMS|1.0|Also crashes when screen is locked in landscape, only app I have that does that.  Just use free version.  Not useful when alarm doesnt work
B0087JTAKW|5.0|To read this book. It is worth every moment, second, hour you spend. As always, ALbom's words inscribe a tale that we are the better for reading.
B000MV9026|5.0|This movie is cute, filled with song, dance and lessons of being true to yourself. I enjoy this movie a lot.
030759565X|5.0|I'm a fan of her blog.  This cookbook does not disappoint.  The cookies I made were fabulous.  Her writing style is like she is in the kitchen with you.
B000FC1MCS|4.0|Several quotes from the book...<br /><br />It has four moods.  Happy, sad, cross and concentrating.  Also, dogs are faithful and the do not tell lies because they can not talk.<br /><br />I can not tell jokes because I do not understand them.<br /><br />If you close your mouth and breathe out loudly through your nose, it can mean that you are relaxed, or that you are bored, or that you are angry, and it all depends on how much air comes out of your nose and what shape your mouth is when you do it and how you are sitting and what you said just before and hundreds of other things which are too complicated to work out in a few seconds.<br /><br />It looked as if there were two very small mice hiding in his nostrils.
B001GXF2YY|5.0|I read this book in just a couple of days (with 3 kids and a busy job) because the plot kept me interested and moving along.  The ending was a bit of a surprise...
B006OCM0G0|3.0|It's not as expected because you have to be a member to do most things. Then the storm8 account is apart of the tasks. No one exactly knows about it and then you don't know who has a storm8 account. Then you have to type in the username. It's pretty complicated. The only reason I bought it was because I like to have my own restaurant and the fact that it was free. But it's not so bad.
B00004U2GH|5.0|I sure can't compliment Johnny any better than millions already have.  This complete concert version is as good as any live album can be at making you feel that you are there.  Great and necessary part of any Cash collection, actually of any collection of great American music.
B004EPZ0AC|5.0|This sequel to Happy feet is just as good as the first if not better, but it's up to you're own taste of movies. I love it.
0316228532|3.0|If you like gritty, real stories that delve into the intricacies of the human mind and soul -- especially the parts we all try to keep hidden -- I think you'll really like this book.<br /><br />If you like your literature to be a little less real, a little more hopeful, if you come in even with a faint hope of Harry Potter magic, this may ruin your childhood.<br /><br />Like most, I came in knowing that this was an adult novel, but I read it because it was Rowling. While I recognized Rowling's voice in every sentence, and that comforted me, the black side of reality beat me over the head. I personally found it a little too real, a little too dark. Of the teenagers that gained major roles in the book, not one had a decent relationship with his/her parents. I liked exactly one adult character (Kay). It bothered me that the older women were all vicious gossips, which seemed a little uncool to me. Besides these small complaints, though, Rowling masterfully creates very complex, compelling characters, and a very compelling story that is not for everyone.
B007MDB6L0|4.0|What can I say?  My daughter likes all of these, but we liked this one much more than &#34;The Great Fairy Rescue&#34;.
B00ADIT8U2|4.0|I played in a few hours.  Did not need significant &quot;helps&quot; to complete.  i think worth the price.  entertaining and a clever plot
B0076DCT2G|5.0|This was a very good read.  I had trouble putting it down.  I would recommend this to anyone who enjoys a good action packed cop spy story.
B000028U0Y|5.0|Up there with the very greatest live albums of all time: Stones Ya Ya's, Allmans Fillmore east, Dead/Greatful Dead, etc, etc, etc.
B004HW7JI8|5.0|Pretty little liars is Awesome! I love this show…if you haven't seen it you're missing out. I have season one and two I plan to keep up with every season and I hope they do a movie too.
B004XJRQUQ|5.0|I love this book way more then the movie because it was so beautiful in its own way I almost cried through the whole book!  I LOVE THIS BOOK I NEVER WANT IT  TO END can't wait to see the movies
B000KUD2G4|5.0|This box is well worth the money. Even with TS (mono) cables, it breaks the ground from input to output. Also, if anyone is interested, I measured the throughput power loss to be only -0.5 dB at 1 kHz, which isn't noticeable at all for my application. Loss in peak-peak voltage is half of that (-0.25 dB)
B008JGSM6G|5.0|Simple concept. Easy to learn. Doesn't get boring. Multiple levels to challenge yourself. Very addictive! Overall fun and entertaining game! O recommend it.
B00AA0TJO8|5.0|This game is so fun. I just wish there werw more levels and more drawing choices-so the fun doesnt have to stop!
B001IBIHQ4|4.0|Don't expect a Band of brothers with palm trees.  It is much more based on 3 individual Marines than a band.  No coverage of MacArthur's Army and Air Corp role in the pacific.  To me, reading the books it is based on (plus Goodbye Darkness, Flags of our fathers, etc.) is probably more enjoyable than the movie but it is still good.
B004XGN8W4|5.0|My son and I love this. It's perfect for travel in hotels or grandma's house. The picture is clear without noticeable lag. The speakers are ok. Good enough but nothing spectacular and it has 2 audio outputs for headphones. It comes with a power cord and the only one input is hdmi. With all the cords and power source of the Xbox, I find I can only fit one cordless controller and a few games. The case is protective but not so much that I would want to drop it or check it in like baggage during a flight. It's more for carrying it around nice and tight. I love the fact that this makes my Xbox 360 portable but remember it does not have a battery back so you will need to plug it in. For 200 bucks it was a good buy for us.
B002Q1YDLI|5.0|Emily Giffin is an amazing author. Her stories are filled with the perfect amount of drama, humour and wonder. Leaving you eager for her next read.
B009VSW15Y|3.0|We purchased this for my kids to play with and to that extent it has been a success.  From a practical standpoint, the absence of an outward facing camera limits the usefulness of this to taking pictures of oneself or being hopeful that you've lined up your target in the frame.  If you want a camera for photos, this is not a great first choice, but if you just want some extra amusement on your tablet this app is fine.  We have not tried Skyping, which may work well with the camera app.
0979019710|5.0|I am half way thru reading The Miracle Morning and I am already so inspired! Simple truths, systematic, easy enough to apply, and support/accountability set your day up for success when so many things in our day set us up for failure. I highly recommend!<br />Belinda Hess
B009VSW15Y|2.0|Ok first off its a good camera it works. But am I the only one who finds it unfair to have your kindle not come with a camera? If you want to have a cheap tablet that comes with a camera seriously just buy an IPad mini.
0316228532|1.0|My children read Harry Potter, loving the series. I thought the author would be writing an uplifting book for adults. Even with chapter one having a death, I imaged characters of a small town collaborating, getting along, learning lessons from one another. Instead, I found a book packed with filthy language, druggies with detailed scenes because of drug use, disgusting sexual images (take the obese man, for example, and what he cannot see), screaming, violence, everyone angry all the time. Why do I want to read a book that leaves me with a headache? What a huge disappointment. Don't bother to read it. Take your precious time and find something that has clean language and is a joy to read.
B008AK8FHM|4.0|I was anxious to read this book because it is written by a man who admittedly was a big skeptic of near death experiences until he had one of his own and his viewpoint, that of a man of science, would provided a different persepective on such events. The book does do that but in some ways it did not include enough detail although that may have been the result of the editing process. I personally do recommend this book.
B0064W652A|5.0|Amazing. One of the best Batman story arcs I've read.  It's up there with Year One and Knightfall. I don't think I've read a Jeph Loeb story I haven't enjoyed.
B009WO7NQO|5.0|If you like the Angry Birds games, this one will not disappoint.  There are some new elements that make it fun and of course the Star Wars theme is teriffic.
B006OCM0G0|5.0|This game is great for kids and adults. Love bakery story too!!!! It's fun because u can cook food at your own restaurant and visit other people's too. Also u can leave them tips. Add shesasexychick
B006ZAZ31U|5.0|This book is absolutely amazing. My fiancé made me go to a Christian book store to find a present for her grandmother and that is where I first saw this book. Don't be turned off that it has a Christian or Jesus element or theme, it is truly amazing and I am a better person for reading this story about this incredible person.
B00ABGEFWC|5.0|this game is grate I could play it all day long it has grate animalls to so cute I injoy it and I'm 11
B009CF7GRY|4.0|It seems like a lot of films from my childhood are being remade these days and Footloose is just another in a long line of them.  I was bored one night and there was nothing else on TV so I gave it shot.  All in all it was an entertaining film.  I thought the beginning started off a little slow but after about 15 minutes it picked up and kept my attention though out the duration.  The film makers did change a few of the more iconic scenes (like playing chicken on tractors) but overall the story was the same.  If you have never seen it or if you aren't to uptight about a few changes to the story then I say give it a shot.
B00AE2J5HI|5.0|Although the film was quite violent, the history orientation provides the reason.  Casting couldn't have been better.  American History I would have paid attention to in school.  Powerful.
B009YP9L7U|3.0|It turned out the way I thought it would. I had some guessing on what might happen and was right most of the time
B008LV8TSU|5.0|I absolutely love this book. It is a brilliant set up and I can't wait to read the next two books in this series.
0446554995|5.0|I have read all of Preston and Child's books. I totally enjoyed it. Certain times I couldn't put it down. There were some things that really got me. They talked about Rockland County, Ramapo and Nanuet. I work there. Also Harriman State Park.<br />I hated it when it ended....Wanted more.
B003JTHXOK|5.0|I loved this book. The details created such vivid images. The suspense and passion kept me on edge and I couldn't put the book down. Amazing love story. Might be my favorite Nicolas Sparks book!
B0083ZRAJS|4.0|I decided to read this book after my son received an illustrated children`s version for Christmas. It was a very good story (much more enjoyable than the movie). I look forward to reading the other books in the series.
B009JBZH54|5.0|I own the DVD's of Batman Begins and The Dark Knight. The Blurays look sooo much better then the DVDs on my HDTV. Its also nice to have some additional content since the DVDs were pretty lacking. The box set is well put together and does not have a cheap feel. I have been waiting to watch the Dark Knight Rises on my home theater setup since the big screen release. Was not disappointed. If you like the Dark Knight trilogy then this is a must own.
B004EPYZZ8|5.0|Her Mom helped me decide what to buy her for her birthday and she was delighted with this -- was shipped on time
B007VT6QSI|5.0|This is a great and worth your money product ;) But if you don't know the songs by heart or just hearing them for the first time you could look them up online and print them type them yourself or if you have a kindle you can purchase a book of the believe lyrics for $2.00 something :) I did. So buy this album.
B001ANSSDC|5.0|Sincere moments and laugh out loud dialog...indeed a book I will never forget and will recommend always.  I am sad it's over.
B001LRJH0U|5.0|Very good movie. I like Viggo Mortenson. The movie is very interesting and well done. I would recommend this movie for western fans.

1594487154|3.0|Years ago, Daniel Pink, got my full attention with his book, A Whole New Mind, that argues for the embracing of the creative in our workplaces, in our education system and in our culture.  As I recall, I read that book in two days.<br /><br />Then came Pink's highly successful book, Drive: The Surprising Truth About What Motivates Us.  Using some of the latest social science research, Pink made the highly complex and heavily researched concept of motivation accessible to the reader by breaking down some commonly held assumptions around motivation and then offering ideas on how to utilize the research findings in our daily lives.  As a trained educator and ardent observer of human behavior, I was already aware of much of what he discussed in this book but found the information useful both professionally and personally. Both of these books were on my recommended reading lists for my students.<br /><br />Daniel Pink's writing style is engaging and highly accessible. At times, he seemingly reads the mind of the reader and offers simple metaphors and typical human activities to illustrate a particular finding or concept.  He presents occasional glimpses into his personal experiences and incorporates just enough humor to make you smile as you read.  His writing is informed by a clear mission and is well-organized, so a reader finishes his books with some textbook-like information written in a pseudo-self help style.<br /><br />When Pink announced the publication of his latest book, To Sell is Human: The Surprising Truth About Moving Others, I was eager to see where he would take us on his latest journey through the world of social science research.  His basic premise is simple: he argues that humans spend considerable energy each day trying to get others to do what we request: purchase, buy in, comply, agree to and even obey.  One professional he interviewed stated it succinctly: \\"Almost everything I do involves persuasion.\\"  Whether you directly sell products, participate in teamwork efforts, attempt to direct the behavior of others or run your own business, you are, in effect, selling or more specifically, moving others to do something.<br /><br />Pink details the repulsion most of us experience with the typical professional sales approach (think used car salesman) and labels it \\"the white-collar equivalent of cleaning toilets - necessary perhaps but unpleasant and even a bit unclean.\\" He reviews the historical protocol for selling and determines that it is officially dead.  The immediate access to information via the Internet has completely altered the balance of power in direct sales exchanges. Consumers know far more and will, in the middle of your sales presentation, look up what you just said on their smart phones.  Pink's book offers strategic advice on how to adapt to the world of the \\"caveat venditor.\\"<br /><br />Overall, the book presents succinct insights and strategies for those who are in the profession of sales.  My initial response to his findings was a tad snarky: the old adage of \\"you catch more flies with honey than vinegar\\" appeared to sum up the notions he presented: if people like you, don't feel threatened, believe that you are listening (rather than waiting to speak) and respond by acknowledging needs and desires...well, it all seems obvious, doesn't it?  But that is what Dan Pink does best: redirects our attention to what seems obvious but not necessarily occuring, supports it with research-based evidence (apparently necessary because in our culture trusting our human instinct and experiences is not enough) and then completes his pitch with storytelling, offering human examples to seal the deal.<br /><br />My disappointment with the book is that he tried too hard to combine the art of selling with the art of persuading.  His attempt to include the areas of education and healthcare were significantly short-changed in this 236 page book.  Some of the concepts he presents could prove effective with surface-level issues in these two complex areas but the influencing of behavior change and human buy-in is worthy of far more examination. Maybe even a new book by the consummate \\"explainer\\" of cultural changes.<br /><br />(Disclosure: I received a free advance copy in exchange for writing a review and helping with promotion of the book.)
B003TSEEDY|5.0|My title might not make sense before reading but the books format, characters and effortless structure made me feel like a personal an  intimate glimpse into their lifes. Unguarded and just bare. Read it in a day and couldnt put it down
B007SGLZP8|5.0|A nice spin for Grishams latest novel. A huge page turner. Once you start you wont beable to put it down.
B009KHDT0C|1.0|I've never seen the older Dark Shadows, so forgive me if I don't &#34;get&#34; this movie, but it was pretty bad. All of the funny lines were used in the movie trailer, so don't expect anything else if you rent it. A lot more could have been done with the plot of this movie; it's a shame they didn't do more with it. Also, there are some major plot holes (which I won't get in to, in case someone wants to watch it), that left me saying &#34;but what about....?&#34; Not worth renting!
B000E6FSPW|5.0|Every song on here is fantastic.One of the main reasons why I loved Rocky IV the movie so much is because of the great songs that it had in it.If you loved the songs from the film...then I highly recommend you buy this CD.
B00AQ3K8IU|5.0|Um, I don't know what to say. Ok, I'll start with the fact that there aren't nearly enough stars available to rate it. Personally, I'd give it at least 76;-) it was the happiest, saddest, funniest, cryeest (cry-ee-est), heart warming, heart breaking thing that I've ever had the pleasure of seeing or reading. Its an honor to say this is the last and most impressing book that I've read this year. Ty for taking your brilliance and imagination and forming into this piece of art. If anyone is on the fence about reading this book, let me push you over it. Your going to way more than live it, trust me. Happy New Tears/Years ( tears was actually a typo at first but I found it to be overly fitting, so it got to stay. Lol)
B003O86FMW|5.0|The book was amazing! Kept me on the edge of my seat the whole time. Can't wait to read the third book.
1600243916|3.0|I&#34;m not received a book. Only CD This CD is excelent good price perfect but i need the book and not come yet
B007PT3QOQ|3.0|It's not really too exciting but it gives you something to do. It's a pretty good game, if you have enough time in your day to keep up with it.
B00AEFVRB2|2.0|Lots of violence, terrible storytelling, horrible characters, and not worth the $3 I spent to rent it.<br /><br />3 more words? THIS MOVIE BLOWS!
B006O6F932|2.0|My 7 year old and 2 year old love it but its only been 5 days and the ladder doesn't stand very well
B005KCGIUY|5.0|MJK simply brings his vocal beauty to Puscifer. This cd is solid on every track, and as a whole. The intro will draw you into this well crafted story of a disc and wont dissapoint any MJK fan.
B003O86FMW|5.0|Couldn't put it down once I started it!  Can't wait to read the next one and see the movie next.
B007BVOEPI|4.0|A gritty, richly detailed historical/timeless fantasy tale...with great character development, locations, special effects, engaging plot line and primo production values. Not for the squeamish as limbs and heads are regularly lopped off...including the head of a central character that I assumed would be spared at the last minute to ensure continuity of his key role. Nope! off it went, leaving us wondering and bummed, (in my case), as he seemed to hold the moral center of the story. I look forward to season two.
B004I744AS|5.0|I HIGHLY RECOMMEND THIS APP TO/FOR ANYBODY! I installed this on my phone after finding out the dictionary I used to have & love was missing a lot of words. After using this app for months, I received a Kindle Fire as an xmas gift, & this app (TheFreeDictionary, by Farlex) was one of the 1st I searched for & installed! I use it every day, multiple times, and even when I don't need a dictionary (I love the Word of the Day & Quote of the Day!) I almost cannot believe this is free, you won't find a better dictionary/thesaurus/etc. app.! Massive appreciation & props to the devs!!!!

1451662432|4.0|The book was received for Christmas and my wife really is enjoying it. I notice it is really a big book, more pages than either of us thought it would be. My wife said she can \\"hear\\" Arnold speaking on every page. Well written and an interesting person. Good Title and can't wait for \\"my turn\\" to read it. I chose a hard cover and it looks great on the coffee table.
B0041KXUGQ|2.0|I've seen the movie before & loved it. looking forward to watching it again!!<br />recevied a blueray DVD /Can't watch it.<br />Do not have  BLUERAY. Disappointed I guess a bad order on my part  :(<br />BJ

B000JRYOPG|5.0|I chose 5 stars because it was riveting, action packed & a very enlightened reflection on the underworld of Jamaica
B00AF6MF9I|4.0|this game serves to pass the time well. goofld break from all the midival versions. well worth looking into. so far 30 min of enjoyment
B003JTHXOK|5.0|Fantastic! Great! Loved how it ended. Can't wait to see the movie. I hope it does the book justice. Awesome
B009ZXT4BY|4.0|The match to light things on fire works well and spreads the fire quickly and easily.  The graphics are only OK with the wolf movement...having the legs move would improve it.
B002BWP49M|5.0|You either love this movie or hate it...  I don't know why someone would buy a movie if they didn't like it, so I only have good things to say about this!  If you saw it originally in the theater, then you know this is the same exact movie.  I only purchase Blu-rays so as to keep the quality and experience as close as possible to the movie theater.
B008XBASVY|5.0|Read this book during one a one-way road trip. Loved it! Encourage social workers, teachers, counselors, and others that work with teens to read this.
B00APUYWYA|3.0|loved being able to stream to my Kindle Fire, the movie however, was not as good as I'd hope.  Wished there had been more singing.
B007ZGBZHE|5.0|Great Pendagrast soory. He solves lots of loose ends. I lived all of this series. This one didn't disappoint me at all. I'll be looking forward to the next one!
B00992CF6W|4.0|Minecraft would get more stars if the price tag weren't so high.  The movement ability within the game are programmed well.
B00AMBH70S|3.0|Good action movie, the ending was kinda abrupt. The movie is very similar to Bourne movie series, nothing really new.
B003WUYRGI|4.0|I didn't like it because it's different from other dictionary and I was very confused I couldn't even tell what it was
B00A3ATW4M|5.0|I must have listened to this CD at least 50 times already.  Wish there had been more songs from the first few episodes of Season 4, but look forward to future CDs.
B005VPRDAY|5.0|My 7 year old granddaughter loves this LEGO set.  The colors are very pretty and &#34;girly&#34; (which she is).  The set keeps her entertained for long periods of time.
B00A757EFW|3.0|The ability to control pac-man isn't as reactive as I'd like.  The graphics are OK--like the original game; nothing fancy.
B00AHSINKO|2.0|We love both Tommy Lee Jones and Meryl Streep, but we were bored throughout this movie.  It never really went anywhere.  We wanted to like it, but it just didn't work.
B00AA0TJO8|5.0|Very cute and original and creative. Thanks for a great game, devs. I like the use of different pencils for different purposes. I think this game is worth buying.
B000VUQ4HW|5.0|What can I say, It's Nosferatu! - Excellent edition - thourourly enjoyed the movie and the special features - will watch over and over.
0399226907|5.0|I bought two of the hungry caterpillar books for grandchildren.  I hope they will like them, because I do.  They are very sturdy and colorful with a simple story that a very young child can follow.
B00AIUUXHC|1.0|\\"Hungry Shark Evolution by Future Games of London Platform: Android\\" Minimum operating system Android 2.3 If this is true, why is it incompatible with my Droid 2, and more importantly, my Samsung Galaxy S3 running Jelly Bean? If it's only compatible with tablets or Kindle Fire, you should spell that out.
B005KR6OBM|1.0|THis is only season 1-4 and Sears is selling seasons 1-5 for $69. Thats almost $15 cheaper and you get the 5th season. This is ridiculous.
B003ZSJ212|5.0|Finally, a nice picture and rumbling surround sound at home. Yes, I purchased the VHS, DVD and now Blu-ray versions of these movies. But, I have been able to hand down the older versions to family or use while traveling, so not a total waste.
B006PHD0RW|5.0|Love this game.  Beware though, it's addicting.  You'll find yourselves baggin groceries into the wee hours of the night.  Enjoy!
B009YP9L7U|5.0|This is obviously a book you need to read for yourself to truly judge it. Some find this story to be boring because of its closer sense of realism.<br />  The characters are attractive, witty, and all in all simple. They go out and do what could happen to anyone. This story is for somone looking for a fun, memorable, quick good time.<br />  If you're looking for a relateable adventure (especially if you're single or wanting to have chilren), then this is the book for you. However if you want somthing exciteable and gets your blood pumping, then this book is most definitely not for you.
B0063IH60K|5.0|If you're looking for a solitary game, thus is definitely the game for you. It keeps the mind active, especially for people who like their own quiet time.
B0094BB4TW|5.0|Its the exact facebook page but simpler! I always  et this app first before any other one!! Never forcloses! Which is perfect!
B005LJKEXS|5.0|This is a well-made active USB extension cable, which I'm using in my home office so I don't have to have our all-in-one printer/scanner/fax next to my desk. The 10 meter length even allowed me to route the cable along some walls, so it's out of the way. The connections are snug as they should be, not overly tight, and the print speed seems to be just as fast as it was when the printer was connected using the shorter original USB cable alone. I'd buy again.
B00AMBLXP8|1.0|could not finish watching, the language was quite repulsive and I'm not a prude!  I wouldn't reccomend this to my worse enemy!

B003JTHXOK|5.0|I can't believe it ended there! I want to know where Alex and Katie go from there! I couldn't put it down....
B00AA0TJO8|4.0|Looks like a great game, but there are definitely calibration problems on my original Kindle Fire. Most of the time it seemed off by about a quarter inch to the left and a little above where I was pressing, making the game pretty much unplayable. Since there's no built in calibration tool then there's not much I can do. Disappointing.<br /><br />Update: On a hunch I decided to reboot to see what happened, and the game now seems to work fine.  I've never had to do this for a newly installed game before, but I can't prove that the game was the problem so I won't fault it.  As long as it continues to work then it seems like a pretty fun and clever game.
B009JBZH54|5.0|Bought this as a christmas present for a friend of mine and couldnt believe the price i got for this awesome blue ray dvd set.
B005WTR4ZI|4.0|Economists have always argued that while technologies displace jobs in the short run, new types of jobs will be invented to employ people in the long term.  While this historical appeal can be somewhat reassuring, it doesn't offer much of a prescription to those entering the labor force in the coming years/decades.  Brynjolfsson & McAfee, in extrapolating on technological trends, attempt to highlight some of the modes of employment that are at risk for disruption.<br /><br />For instance, it's hard not to notice the growing number of self-checkout kiosks in supermarkets and big box stores, suggesting a sinister kiosks:cashier::asteroid:dinosaurs relationship.  One of the bigger surprises is the degree to which high-wage jobs are too at the precipice.  The book provides the example of document review by lawyers--where new digital technologies enable one lawyer to do the work of 500.  And one wonders how Watson (combined with next-gen sequencing, statistical analysis, and better diagnostics+preventative medicine) might similarly shrink the number of doctors (diagnosticians) needed in the medical profession.  The authors then take a step back and delineate the groups who stand to benefit and suffer from these trends, respectively:<br /><br />(1) high-skilled vs. low-skilled workers<br />(2) superstars vs. everyone else<br />(3) capital vs. labor.<br /><br />They point out one of the most troubling repercussions of these trends--the increasing skewness of income distribution, which is a direct result of becoming more productive while employing less.  They also point out that while income redistribution (e.g. progressive taxation) can somewhat ameliorate these problems, it does nothing to address the root causes---the low productivity of the un/underemployed.<br /><br />The authors remedies' for these problems include a hyperspecialized economy, disincentivizing financial work, and harnessing technology and the scientific method to improve education.  I'm not too compelled by these, but I can't present a better vision of the future, so I guess we'll just have to see how it all plays out.
0446547646|4.0|Loved the characters; they fell in love in high school. She was rich and he was poor. They separated because Amanda went off to college and Dawson eventually left his hometown to work in another state on an oil rig. Years later they reunited through Tuck's Will after he dies. I wish the book had a better and different ending, but other then that, it's good.
B003WUYRGI|1.0|Well beacuse it wasn't that great and I just like rating things so yeah it wasn't the best I can tell yeah that but it was kinda neat to read it tho bye
B005LAIIHG|5.0|This film is a marvellous adventure that is not done for little children who will get frightened but for children closer to 77 than to 7 years of age. But it is such a beautiful story that adults might like it too.<br /><br />Frightening like hell not on earth but on the Pacific Ocean. A shipwreck that sinks a cargo boat with only one survivor, a teenager hardly able to use a razor to shave and three animals from his father's zoo, animals that were being taken away to Canada to be sold: a Bengali tiger, a zebra and a hyena. The hyena is ignominious and it attacks the zebra on the lifeboat without even hesitating. The tiger is another story and the teenager is still another novel all by himself.<br /><br />But when you want to survive and you have in you the god that supports you, not a god with a trunk as long as a nose, or vice versa, not a god that dies on the cross for others, not a god that is hermaphrodite according to your capricious desires. Not at all. A god that is powerful in your soul, inspiring in your spirit, supportive in your mind and absolutely logical in your brain. Then you have the force with you and you can stand up against a Bengali tiger and tame it, and you can stamp your feet against the elements and organize your survival and that of \\"your\\" tiger.<br /><br />Then you have the mysterious island of Doctor Moreau, a carnivorous island that is also slightly cannibalistic. It is all sweet and nice in the day time but it turns flesh voracious at night. Can you imagine a tender teenager with no hairs on his face and a Bengali tiger: that's what I would call a meat ravenous predator's delicatessen treat.<br /><br />What is surprising but not so much if you know animals slightly is the tiger's taming. A wild animal will accept in some extreme conditions to be tamed when it feels you are the one who is going to help it survive if it lets you survive. Animals are intelligent and in extreme conditions they know their interest. I was told that many times in Sri Lanka where I used to walk in the jungle. I was told that if on your way a lion, a wild cat or an elephant comes to cross it towards its own destination, don't run, don't scream, don't make any brusque movement. The animal knew you were coming a long time before you ever knew it was there. If you don't block its way, if you do not produce the mammal hormone of fear that stinks like hell, if you look at the animal straight in the eyes and at the most slowly step back without getting your eyes away from its nor turning you back onto it, the animal will not attack you, and in fact most of the time the animal will avoid you and you will never see it though you might walk a few yards away from it.<br /><br />Animals are intelligent and they are not necessarily man's predators, even Bengali tigers.<br /><br />But when the animal will no longer need Pi it will just walk away back into its own animal life without even looking back. A wild animal can be tamed but it will never be the pet of a human being.<br /><br />The second lesson is that the insurance company of the ship does not accept that strange story with a tamed tiger and a carnivorous island, but it accepts quite well the story of four survivors with the odious cook who eats a rat, cuts up a sailor to catch fish, kills the mother of the hero and is killed by the hero himself. That sounds absurd in a way but human beings prefer a gross and totally inhuman story to a marvellous story about a wild animal that accepts to be tamed to survive and then walks away.<br /><br />The last idea or rather warning is that if some of you are secular minded to the point of negating any possible divinity or superior being or even superior force, don't go. This film is not about the gods we know in any religion but about the god that lives in your skull and animates you so strongly that it makes you able to survive in numerous situations without being a monster and using your fellow traveller as bait for sharks. Even if thatfellow traveller is a wild Bengali tiger you have to tame it first. In fact if that god, like Jesus, you have him in your mind, brain, soul, spirit or whatever, dying on the cross becomes like an easy mission that you will not even try to evade or suspend or escape from.<br /><br />Too bad for those who consider any religious or mystic belief is an alienation and a fairy tale for dummies, because I know so many people who are beautiful for others and empathetic for any suffering just because in them they have the gem of that transcendence.<br /><br />Dr Jacques COULARDEAUfellow traveller is a wild Bengali tiger you have to tame it first.

B005S9EK5Y|5.0|I have always loved the music of Les Miserables and when the movie with Liam Neeson came out, I loved it too.  This movie put it all together for me.  It was amazing, wonderful and gut wrenching.  Take your tissues, this should win academy awards for all.

B0086700CM|1.0|I would rate this game higher if it actually worked for the kindle fire. On here once you get to tilt to collect coins it does not tilt so you can play for about 1 minute, then your character dies.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|I loved it. Two thumbs up for this book and I would recommend it to anyone. Can't wait to read more of the series.

The box includes very NICE photos of George. GREAT
B0086700CM|5.0|The best place to play it is in the bathroom bcuz it is quiet and u will only b able to hear the game
B007FJFDXS|4.0|A classic game revisited by the mobile market with modern graphics and several means of control, they manage to keep the game interesting without relying on &#34;rebranding&#34; the game as you progress.  A big plus for me is the lack of in app purchases.<br /><br />While this game would quickly frustrate the under 10 crowd, I readily recommend this game for all other ages.
B00A77II0U|4.0|I really enjoyed this. Very different. I don't usually buy games unless someone tells me good things . I stumbled across it by accident
1594487154|5.0|Arthur Miller created the archetype of the insecure, self-deluded traveling salesman in his Pulitzer-Prize winning play, Death of a Salesman. I have my own Willy Loman story.<br /><br />When I was in high school, I earned extra money by lugging around a sample case of candles and selling door to door. There were, of course, the easy marks; my parents and the next-door neighbors.  Beyond the comfortable confines of my immediate neighborhood, it was a teenager's view of hell - doors slammed, fingers wagging no from behind lace curtains, and the one-hour pitch that led to \\"I'll have to think about it.\\"<br /><br />Like most Americans, I have a rather dim view of salespeople.  In fact, it is usually ranked among the most distrusted professions along with stock traders, politicians, dentists, and lawyers.<br /><br />Which is surprising, because Dan Pink, the author of the new book, To Sell is Human; the Surprising Truth About Moving Others was a lawyer.  Pink, the author of such best sellers as A Whole New Mind and Drive takes a fresh and engaging look at the art and social science of selling.  In fact, his thesis is that in one way or another, we are all salespeople.<br /><br />Pink begins with some provocative statistics - the result of his study with Qualtrics, a research and date analytics company.  The study, What Do You Do At Work?, revealed \\"that people are now spending 40 percent of their time at work engaging in non-sales: selling - persuading, influencing and convincing others in ways that don't involve anyone making a purchase. Across a wide range of professions, we are devoting roughly twenty-four minutes of every hour to moving others.\\"<br /><br />The book makes a compelling argument that \\"we are all in sales now\\" because while the existing data show that 1 in 9 Americans work in sales, the new data reveal so do the other 8 in 9.<br /><br />In all of his books, Pink (Like Malcolm Gladwell) uses behavioral economics and science to illuminate a subject - in many ways, counterintuitive to what many of us believe.<br /><br />For example, he cites a 2008 experiment where researchers simulated a negotiation over the sale of a gas station.  (I assume this was before the great financial meltdown.)<br /><br />\\"Like many real-life negotiations, this one presented what looked like an obstacle: The highest price the buyer would pay was less than the lowest price the seller would accept.  However, the parties had other mutual interests that, if surfaced, could lead to a deal both would accept.\\"<br /><br />Pink continues, \\"One-third of the negotiators were instructed to imagine what the other side was feeling, while one-third was instructed to imagine what the other side was thinking.  (The remaining third, given bland and generic instructions, was the control group.)\\"<br /><br />The result?  The empathizers (feeling) struck many more deals than the control group, But the perspective takers (thinking) did even better: 75% of them managed to fashion a deal that satisfied both sides.<br /><br />The authors of the study, Adam Galinsky, Joe Magee, M. Inesi add Deborah Gruenfeld and another study by William Maddux showed that \\"Empathy...was effective but less so, and was, at times a detriment to both discovering creative solutions and self-interest.\\"<br /><br />Pink also dispels the myth that extroverts make the best salespeople in today's economy and that the \\"Ambivert\\" - someone who is somewhere between an extrovert and an introvert is the rising star in moving people.<br /><br />If you're familiar with the classic Alec Baldwin uber-salesman scene in David Mamet's Glengarry, Glen Ross you'll know that the ABC scribbled on the chalkboard means, \\"Always be closing.\\"  (For movie fans, Mamet wrote that scene for Baldwin and is not in the original play).<br /><br />Pink has rewired and rethought the ABC of the new world of selling and it's Attunement, Buoyancy, and Clarity.  Like his other books, he complements each idea with relevant case studies, strategies and a number of insight exercises.<br /><br />He offers six successors to the standard elevator pitch.  Shows you why problem finding may be a smarter strategy than problem solving, and how skills in improvisation can dramatically improve how to move people.<br /><br />All of which makes To Sell Is Human - a delightfully useful read.  Essentially, Pink is reframing what \\"selling\\" is all about.  We are all salespeople because everyday we are selling ideas, positions, and strategies to other people.  I highly recommend it.<br /><br />I know Dan personally and marvel how there are very few pictures of him without a purple shirt and he doesn't disappoint in To Sell Is Human.  So, I requested a preview copy and bought my own Kindle version as well.<br /><br />I first met him at a book signing at BIF (Business Innovation Factory) and what impressed me is that he didn't simply sign books; he had short, meaningful conversations with everyone.  I think he's a reluctant salesperson.  Dan is more interested in sharing information and ideas than selling you a product or service.<br /><br />And ultimately, that's the foundation of the new age of sales - how to move others, by moving yourself.<br /><br />And for anyone wishing to sell candles door to door, the Pray Hands cylinder candle was a big hit.

B00APUYWYA|5.0|I'd heard this was &#34;like Bridesmaids.&#34;  I don't think I ever drew that comparison while watching &#34;Pitch Perfect,&#34; but it was a very funny, well acted movie with an outstanding ensemble cast.  Anna Kendrick was fabulous.  I'll bet she has a shiny career ahead of her.  But the entire cast was great.  It was just a fun, enjoyable watch.
B008220C38|5.0|Saw this film in theaters and this is where it should always be. But take it as you can--as large a screen as possible however.<br /><br />There was not a single point whereupon I was not 100% engrossed in the film. Even if you know the ending, you cannot help but fall in love with each of the characters as they are portrayed. The choice to make it a stage play of sorts was risky, but worth it--I, the viewer, put more into the film than I would have had he gone a more traditional route.<br /><br />So rich and colorful, passionate, bright, and dizzying--I cannot sing its praises enough. See it!
B0054JZC6E|4.0|This collection of games is the perfect time waster... just enough mindless excellence to pass the time. You will not find a better app for passing time :-)

B008HJGPVO|4.0|I've never seen a stylus with so many tips. This has three of different size. The smallest tip is reversible with the middle sized  one. This brings up the one down side of the stylus. The barrel with smallest tip reverses to a slightly larger one, however when reversed the barrel does not click solidly into into the top. I wouldn't trust the barrel to stay in place. Other than that, this is an excellent stylus. The tips are not as squishy as some cheaper styluses, which makes the stylus feel better when in use.
B0094BB4TW|2.0|This has not worked correctly since I received the kindle-fire.  It scrolls for a couple of pages, then will not scroll anymore, thus severely limiting any facebook time.  The white page suddenly turns blue,then stops going on.  Very disappointing.
B00AQ3K8IU|5.0|I have never loved a book as much as this one.  I could not put it down from the second I started reading it.  This is an ADULT book though.  If you are an adult you will love Sky's story.  I can't wait to read more from this author! Amazing story!  Read the free sample and you'll be hooked just like me.
B007XKEY6Q|5.0|love it - play with my sisters a lot.  can't wait to introduce my friends to it.  We'll have hours of enjoyment!!

B008F9VCC8|5.0|My son wanted the one book, the Maze Runner, and to find all three in one package was great.  The product came in great condition and shipped very fast.  I would recommend this for any young teenager.
B00APUQT7I|5.0|Grandsons, age 8 and 12, and Grandfather REALLY enjoyed it!  Lots of laughs and just enough fright to keep them interested.
1400067820|5.0|Just as I am committed to re-reading Antifragile so too, it would take me several reviews to try to get the full measure of the book and the man Nassim Nicholas Taleb. I try to do him the honor of offering this brief review of his latest labor of love... Antifragile. I have enjoyed Fooled by Randomness, Black Swan and his little book of aphorisms.  Antifragile is Taleb's Summa.<br /><br />Taleb's writing demonstrates the need for our youth to study and benefit from the classics. I dare say many more would study the classics if they read Fat Tony verbally sparing with Socrates. Taleb's respect for the past is another trait  demonstrated throughout Antifragile. So too  his practicing his Greek Orthodox faith shows he is deeply rooted. His  willingness to lock horns with the secular elites reflects his courage.  His appreciation of fasting and dietary laws common to many ancient religions is not only wise but counter cultural to the customs of today.<br /><br />Above all, the man as an independent thinker not only as reflected in his willingness to question prevailing and conventional views but also his willingness to walk away from Wall Street and break the political and financial strings that restrict the independence of those there tells me he practices what he preaches. Such moves makes me to respect not only his writings but more importantly the man behind these books.<br /><br />Finally, Taleb is a man's man who has pals like \\"Fat Tony\\" and works out and invest only with those that have skin in the game. He is a guy I would rather have a glass of Merlot with rather than Jamie Diamond.<br /><br />Now I must return to reread Antifragile to see what I missed in my first read.
B003XF1XOQ|5.0|Best book ever not just this one but all three. I hope they make the movies as good as the books!!!
B0063GORYU|5.0|this game is fun. it is simple yet challenging at the same time. you are always trying to better your score. finish faster and with less moves than the game before.
B008XNZMOU|5.0|Love this album.  The first few songs are such a departure from the &#34;normal&#34; Taylor Swift offerings (and much better than the songs they constantly play on the radio). It's great to see her evolving as an artist.  If you're a TS fan you'll love this album.
B003E8P9G0|4.0|After reading the Percy Jackson books, we tried this new one by Rick Riordan.  It's similar to Percy Jackson in some ways, but just a little darker.  My twelve-year-old daughter can't decide which series she likes better.  The Egyptian gods are alive and well and still working their magic in today's world.  The orphaned twins who are the main characters have a very short time to learn about the gods and how to use their powers so they can save the world.
B009SQRC9E|5.0|Very sweet movie. Great message, positive, and my four year old loves it!! I highly recommend it!  And it's something an adult will enjoy watching.
B004DLPXAO|5.0|I have been a Kindle e-book reader user since 11-2010. I am very happy with my e-books and the function<br />of my e-book Readers. I own two. A Kindle-3 w/keyboard purchased 11-2010, and a Kindle Basic purchased on<br />09/2011. The upgrades have been very easy. I take the small one to my medical appointments at the VA.<br />It helps the waiting pass more easily. I recently purchased a Kindle Fire HD 8.2 for my wife for her birthday.<br />She enjoys it very much ! The Kindle for Android works very well on my old Viewsonic g-Tablet.
0425170349|3.0|I first read Rainbow Six when I was ten or eleven. Then it seemed great. I reread it recently at age 18 to see if I still enjoyed it, and found to my disappointment that it was not the same. My aim in writing this review is to provide the most helpful and completely honest review of this novel that I can. That being said, some background...<br /><br />I am not overly qualified to write a review of this book, as I am not well-versed in the details and minutia of military strategy and equipment. However, I am and have been a Clancy fan for many years, and have read his work widely.<br /><br />The quick and dirty version of this review is as follows: Rainbow 6 represents a significant backslide from the Clancy who wrote the famous Cold War Era books we all love. This is confirmed in most every other 1,2,3, and even some 4 star reviews that I have read. The plot is a mix of relatively unoriginal sub-stories and action scenes woven together into an in-congruent main story. The characters have little depth, as many others confirm, and (heroes and villains alike) demonstrate questionable, if not outright disturbing, mindsets. That being said, the jargon and technical data Clancy is given to producing is intact and interesting (to me), though some have found mistakes (I do not debate their existence, but I did not notice them and I do not feel that they detract from the story).<br /><br />The following paragraphs present more in depth analyses of these problems. They are listed in order of annoyance to me personally, but can be taken in any order and have no intrinsic rank. Next to the title of each are two numbers enclosed in parenthesis, the first of which represent how bad the particular problem is on a scale of 1 to 5. The second number represents how characteristic (1 to 5) that type of problem is to Clancy in general. In this way, Clancy fans can ignore comments with low first numbers and high second numbers, while new-to-the-author types can shy away from Clancy if off-put by high second numbers.<br /><br />REPETITION (5)(3):<br />  Much of this book seems to be recycled, either from other books, or, worse, from earlier pages in Rainbow Six itself. I cannot remember how many times the phrase \\"pure vanilla\\" occurred in the writing, but it was enough for me to notice and be annoyed - i.e. probably too much. The virus plot is also recycled as others have pointed out. Many scenes involving terrorist take-downs are carbon copies of each other. I cannot count the number of times that someone \\"put 3 10mm hollow points\\" through someone else's head, but again, it was too many. Clancy always has some of this, but I have not seen it this bad.<br /><br />DISTURBING IMAGERY (4)(1):<br />  Clancy, in my opinion, has always stayed pretty clean in his writing where violence is concerned. Not so in Rainbow Six. This novel is filled, literally to the 850 page brim, with violent images, gore, blood, and (in my non-military opinion) unwarranted and unnecessary killing (for instance, the team actually kills an unarmed [disarmed] terrorist after a hostage situation has been resolved. He is literally shot in the stomach and spleen, fatally, but not immediately fatally, injured when he poses no threat and could have easily been taken alive. This is a disturbing image, and a breach in the professionalism Clancy tries to associate with the team. There are more examples of unnecessary killing and gore throughout.<br /><br />DIALOGUE AND THOUGHT (4)(3):<br />  Dialogue is not one of Tom's strong suits, and never has been, but it seems just a little weaker in this book. Scenes which are supposed to have emotion and depth of feeling do not. There is no moment in this book (like there is in the sum of all fears) where I fear for the relationship between anybody. In fact, there are no relationships, because the dialogue to create them is so weak. An unfortunate lapse in proper writing - many good opportunities to develop the shallow characters were missed when the words fell flat. Thought process is also weak in this novel - nobody seems to actually think like a human. People spend so much time thinking about how proud they are, and how much they hate terrorists, that they never actually think about wanting to be home, never have fear or worry about making mistakes, never really ( I say really because attempts are made) consider the responsibility that they have. In addition, the villains actually have no thoughts - an unfortunate departure from the Cold War Era villains that filled Clancy's classics.<br /><br />CHARACTERS (4)(2):<br />  Tom Clancy is not Harper Lee, or Steinbeck, or Dickens. There are no characters in any of his books that are as real - as wholly human as Atticus Finch, Tom Joad, or Pip. But there used to be characters that you could get behind: namely Jack Ryan. Like all the other fans, I understand John Patrick Ryan's days are done, and Clancy needs someone else. The shameful part is that he takes two great, round characters (Domingo Chavez and John Clark) from previous Jack Ryan novels and nearly ruins them. Luckily, Clark maintains some depth and can still be appreciated, but Clancy has actually managed to flatten the round character of Chavez - a feat impressive, but in a bad way. No other characters except the oft mentioned Popov really seem to be their at all. Unfortunately, Clancy also makes the characters (good guys in particular) unlikable - they are all egotistical masters of warfare who care little for life and who enjoy slaughter. I understand duty. I understand military ethos. I read a book by Navy SEAK Chris Kyle who hated terrorists and did not pause before shooting armed enemies dead. But even Kyle had a sense that he was ending someone's life, and I doubt he would have had the gall to joke about the hole he put in somebody's head whilst standing over their body. Some things are off limits. But apparently not in R6.<br /><br />GENERALIZATIONS (5)(5):<br />  This is a problem that has always been HUGE in Clancy's work. People are grouped by one shared characteristic, and then assigned whatever beliefs Clancy wants to assign them. For instance (all examples taken from R6) all terrorists are foolish and ideological. Ok. Well what about the terrorists that are religious? Or smart? Or who just don't give a damn and are out and out crazy? Also, all military soldiers are geniuses, incapable of error, against terrorism in a \\"snipe your wife and kids in the stomach and leave them to die\\" kind of way. I am not in the military, but if I was - I would find that generalization very insulting. All British people talk completely different than Americans (true to some degree, but not to this degree). Women are never in the service anywhere!? Every environmentalist is a terrorism-bound crazy. I am not entirely certain how I did not notice all of this in Clancy's writing before, but WOW! I can get past it, but really? Really?<br /><br />CAPTAIN AMERICA (5)(4):<br />  Nothing new here. I love my country. And maybe I will be damned but I think we do have it pretty right here (politics and all) in the United States. But we are not God. And other Countries do exist/are as good. This also applies to the heroes in the book of any nationality. As is usual in Clancy writing in R6 anyone American or \\"good\\" is indestructible, incapable of failure or accident, and in possession of the best technology. Anyone not US affiliated or \\"bad\\" is foolish and incapable - in fact the villains often seem to fall over and destroy themselves with no hero help needed. Annoying and unrealistic. We make mistakes like everyone else.<br /><br />Overall, I repeat my earlier sentiments. This book is fair - and based on a good, albeit VERY fictional, idea - but it suffers from a number of setbacks which impair the writing. Many Clancy novels suffer from these problems, but not to this degree. In fact, in almost every other novel of his it is easy to ignore theses issues completely (even on the third or fourth reread). I feel this is evidence of lazy writing and forced structure. Shameful, and un-Clancy-like.<br /><br />Good writing is often flawed, because all writing is flawed to some degree, but the mark of good writing is its ability to distract you so well with all of the positives that you never notice the negatives. In great writing, the flaws are hidden so well they are often invisible even when you are looking for them. Clancy is not and never was/will be a great writer - by which I mean on level with the true geniuses. But he was always a good one...at least...until this book. Read it once (but get it from the library) if you are a fan. Read The Hunt for Red October (again if you've read it once) if you are just into this genre. Run like hell if the military and endless detail are not for you.<br /><br />I hope this is of some help.
B007SGLZP8|4.0|If you like Grisham you will like this adventure into a world of promises already broken.<br />It is an escape we all dream about at one time or another.
B007PVHMCG|4.0|We got this for our 12-year-old daughter and 14-year-old son, who are Minecraft AND Lego fans.  They loved building the set, and then they put it up on our Lego display shelf because they don't want to lose any of the tiny pieces.  They still play minecraft on the computer and build with Legos.  I think we'd have to buy them another one of these sets before they would add it to the other Legos and play with it.  They are really hoping Lego comes out with more Minecraft sets.
B0045XICB2|1.0|It would help if someone in these movies could actually act. All atmosphere and not explication. The whole series is so bad!!
B000SGRONM|1.0|The stories would start, introduce the characters, a plot, and then stop. No climax or resolution was reached and it was really unsayistfying. Many of the stories seemed pointless. This was definitely not as funny as other reviews make it out to be.
B0054JZC6E|5.0|This app is fun but if you dont like to wait awile for it to download there might be a little problem... it took me about six minutes to download but it is overall a really good game.
B00656C6KK|3.0|It was nice, but there are cds by her that are much better.  Its<br />one of those cd's that you have and do not paly often.
B003XF1XOQ|3.0|If you've already read the first two books in the series, you'll have to read this one to find out what happens.  But we all hated the ending.
B002PQ7JQK|5.0|I'm so glad I ordered this set of TOS, Being able to watch with updated special effects or the original version is very nice; I remember growing up watching the reruns and being so taken with everything I saw. I guess this proves kids are so much more willing to immerse themselves in whatever they see-- as an adult I chuckle at most of the original cgs and costumes. But I still love this show and enjoy nearly every episode (of the first 2 seasons anyway, and even quite a few of season 3). The updated version is a great way for people who have never seen Star Trek to get their feet wet. It's not gonna blow their minds but it will be less jarring in comparison to what we are used to seeing now. If they can get passed that and enjoy the characters and the sometimes amazingly over-the-top stories, they will have a great time!
B0067RQYNW|5.0|Good WPS for free.  Pretty cool.  I like the ability to be able to take my MS Word documents with me and edit them.
B000VYX8PE|5.0|I rated this book five stars because of its phenomenal description and (if you know what I mean) it's horribly sad, yet satisfying story. This is a book I would recommend to anyone who doesn't mind a bad ending. Lemony Snicket is a great author, and this is one of the greatest books I have read. And, may I add that I could not put this book down until I had read the entire thing.
B009H7SCMA|5.0|An excellent read! Steamy romance and biting satire in one well rounded book! Alan Hardy is a master of his craft!
B009JBZH54|4.0|as good as expected are my favorite movies so I like the special features. I feel i paid good for the quality of the product.
B009R5GR1K|5.0|Entertaing and informative app!  I found the components to be interesti<br />ng and challenging and with a friendly user interface.
B005CRQ3NY|5.0|Diary of a wimpy kid is a great series! Jeff Kinney have done it again! Keep writing more books every year!
B005CRQ4GU|4.0|It was short but the ending wasn't that well but besides that it was good I loved the background information
B000FC1CYG|5.0|I enjoyed the story, historical events and mystery. It kept my attention,and didn't want to stop reading.  Interesting story and characters.
B009YP9L7U|3.0|Boy and girl meet in a bar in Las Vegas and spend the night before her cousin's wedding touring the town and getting to know each other. The next morning, she wakes up to find a new wedding band on her finger, the new husband by her side, and  no memory of the night before.  While the bride is praying to the porcelain god, calling her husband by the wrong name, and asking for a lawyer, the groom is determined to convince her to stay married.  Both of the protagonists have been in multiple relationships that have ended badly, both are damaged by their childhoods and the poor examples of their parents and believe that they will never find love. They decide to give the marriage a trial period of three months, so that Connor can prove to Megan that a marriage based on friendship,shared goals, mutual respect and trust will fill all their needs and be the ideal marriage for them both. Nobody will need to fall in love... As all romances go, that particular plan doesn't work out so well. These two vulnerable people have to learn how to love and be loved.<br />A fun read. Heat factor moderate.
B003XF1XOQ|5.0|This is a good finale to the series. They are an easy read and I really enjoyed the ending. Sometimes, I fear that this is what our society will end up looking like someday.
B00AK0X5VQ|5.0|This is a great game.  You need to have some patience to play.  The soundtrack is also quite nice.  This is a great way to while away some time.
0099555352|5.0|I was very pleased with the way Mankell drew my attention in at the very first.  I was hooked.  It was also interesting to note that he referred to the protagonist by both first and last name in every instance until about 2/3 of the way through the book.  Perhaps this is where he felt she was familiar enough to us to drop the formality.  But I loved it!  Every turn was calculated and precise.
B005CRQ4GU|5.0|This book is so funny and awesome hopefully there  is going to be  a next book that will add to the series of this wimpy kid!!
B0054JZC6E|5.0|Very good for passing time. Enjoyed it very much.  Could not stop playing the first day it downloaded. Kids loved it also
B003O86FMW|5.0|Great story and I loved the characters, the plot, the prose and most of all, the imagination it took to write the series.
B009MF5BXK|4.0|Funnier and even more unbelievable (where did that plane come from?) than the first.  Did not disappoint.  Chuck and JCVD were great additions to the already action packed geezer brigade.
B008XBCJ34|3.0|Great movie but the 3-D effect was, at best, marginal. Couldn't tell much difference with the glasses on or off.
B005ZOBNOI|5.0|I cried more than once. Beautifully written. A must read for everyone ages 12 and up. I wish there was more time for Augustus Waters.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|The reason I gave this book a five star rating is because of how it had thrills action and  mixed up romance. I would have to say I loved everything about this book, the best book I've ever read. I would recommend this book to all of my friends and family. In fact my mother is about to read this book. Suzanne Collins you have done the world a favor writing this book.
B000JQU1VS|5.0|Wonderful to have these classic stories at my fingertips. I first met Sherlock as a kid about 8 years old. I am now 60 and still re-reads these every few years.
1400069289|5.0|Full of good info on how habits are formed and how they can be changed.....order copies for several members of my family.
B000KKPN5C|4.0|Provides me the extra boost needed over the built in flash; and the tilt eliminates to shadows behind the subject.
B005COO1X6|5.0|It was a very exciting book. Also, was just long enough for a short story. I have read all most all of his books...must have missed this one.i
B005ZOBNOI|5.0|This book is perfect. This is my second time through and I foresee it becoming my own Imperial Affliction - I'll be reading it for years to come.<br /><br />Thank you, John Green, for writing this book, but I'm not going ask you what happens to the others. What happened to Hazel is good enough for me.
B00AJRQLTI|4.0|Being the fact that I purchased this off amazon for only $5 vs the other places that was charging the regular price of a album ($14.99) I was still a little disappointed. I was expect more out of it. I guess I will just have to wait for another CD to be out so I can truly experience it.  Others may say just purchase the 10, 25th anniversary CD. But something about some actors on film is just something I want to listen to.
B007MDQW3W|3.0|It just was not what I expected...got it as a gift for my daughter and we were both a little underwhelmed.
B00632HWOG|3.0|Yahoo is just an average email carrier. Its biggest problem is that the so called filter for spam and other contentious materail does not do a good job.
B009YP9L7U|4.0|I couldn't put it down - even though I guessed how it would end... Not quite E.L. James, but good enough:)
B00AMBK0X4|3.0|This movie had it's funny moments, after a while it was just plain tired. I'd hoped that it would turn the corner and become funny again, but no such luck.
0553280325|5.0|How can you go wrong with a Ray Bradbury story....I sent this to my 17 year old grandson as an introduction to other fiction.
B005HJWWW8|4.0|May consider using this if you use a high powered headphone like Sony MDR-XB700 Extra Base. This provides a simple solution to a higher power demand with minimal distortion.
B002NZTZ8S|5.0|A simple story wonderfully portrayed.  Joyful for all ages, and will be watched many times.  The animation itself is worth watching, and all 'believers' will enjoy this santa tale.
0545265355|5.0|I got this for my Neice for Christmas and she was so happy when she opened the set. Was exactly like picture.
B000O8OTNC|5.0|Works pretty good. I keep it in my INCH bag. I use a stone here at home but in the field it's perfect. Can handle a variety of blade sizes and shapes, and it's quick and easy. Great for the outdoorsman on the move.
B00AMBLXP8|5.0|Ted is the only movie people ask you if you have seen at the Christmas family get together.  It is not a movie you should see but a movie you should buy.
B005K0HDGE|4.0|Of course, as a Stephen King fan I love his style of writing but like all writers, good, bad or indifferent, there are few surprises for you learn to anticipate what is around the corner.  This is a well written story and very enjoyable reading.
B00969PR18|5.0|This app is really the only map for the kindle fire and I haven't had a single problem with it. Nothing like the other reviews. Running stock KF 1st Gen.
B0094BB4TW|4.0|I'm surprised by the bad reviews. It works fine on my kindle fire.. some of the games that are normally free on Facebook instead take you to the app store and ask you to buy the game. Other than that the app works fine overall
0756404738|3.0|Rothfuss is an amazing story teller but only an average writer.  The fantasy & adventure sequences are so good, that I didn't mind losing the plot every now and then; however, one million unnecessary adverbs abound (smiled coyly - smiled wanly - smiled shyly - teased gently - chided angrily - whispered softly) and the \\"romance\\" sequences are ghastly.  Almost anything between Kvothe and Denna seems like it was written by an unbearably pompous twelve year-old, and I found myself wishing she'd die somehow.  Lastly, does Kvothe have to be Master of Everything?  Best lover, best musician, best magician, nicest person to the downtrodden, smartest, hardest working, etc.  It gets a bit embarrassing to read character after character saying things like, \\"It took me fifteen years of hard practice and yet you're better than me after one hour!!!\\"<br />All that said, I can't wait for the 3rd book.
1401235417|5.0|Before you consider reading this, I should tell you that this book is part of THE NEW 52. &#34;The New 52&#34; is company wide reboot of all DC comics characters. So not only have their comics been restarted at issue one, but some characters have had some changes in their back history as well. But don't worry Bat-Fans; the majority of the dark knight's history has been unaltered (the only change I personally have a problem with is that Barbra Gordon is back as Batgirl, and I'm more of an Oracle fan). That's all I'm going to say about &#34;The New 52,&#34; now to get to the story!<br /><br />We all know that Batman is the protector of Gotham City. He's a guardian that watches it at night, protects the innocent from the scum of its underbelly, and is considered a legend to every citizen in Gotham... or so we thought. Because now, &#34;The New 52&#34; reveals a legend that has existed in Gotham, centuries before the Batman: THE COURT OF OWLS! The Court of Owls is a society that dates back to the founding of Gotham 400 years, and there is little known about them. But what is known is that the court has a firm grip on Gotham from the shadows, and will eliminate those who would threaten their agenda. The Talon, an elite assassin in the garb of an owl, carries out the assassinations. Batman has always believed that the court was just a myth, as he has protected Gotham for years. But the dark knight begins to come across clues of the court's existence, and will eventually have to accept the impossible truth: he does not know the city as much as he once thought he did.<br /><br />Scott Snyder does an astonishing job on the story! He drives deep into the dark knight's psyche, and shows his internal struggle over whether or not the court exists. The reason Batman refuses to believe that the court is real, is because he has always thought that he was the true guardian of Gotham, that he was it's true legend. And to learn that the court is the real power over Gotham is unbearable for him as he still tries to doubt it, and his overconfidence in himself, nearly gets him killed. It's a feat that Snyder handles so well. &#34;Complex Magazine&#34; called Snyder the &#34;defining Batman writer of our generation,&#34; and after reading this, I believe that they might be right. He's not as ultimate as Frank Miller (THE DARK KNIGHT RETURNS, BATMAN: YEAR ONE) and Jeph Loeb (BATMAN: THE LONG HALLOWEEN, BATMAN: HUSH), but he has made his way into the list of my favorite Batman writers. Seriously, it's a fun and shocking read! Plus the artwork is sensational as well! A great start for the dark knight in &#34;The New 52!&#34;l tries to doubt it, and his overconfidence in himself, nearly gets him killed.

B009H7SCMA|5.0|When I began reading Gabriella, I immediately decided to take out a piece of scrap paper and write out the multitude of thoughts that came to mind - quirky, shocking, awe, satire, politically incorrect, daring, extreme, intriguing and many more. Over the course of the novel, I came to appreciate the witty, skillful writing and cunning play on this class-war love story.<br /><br />Falling in love, during a cricket match - who would've thought it? And in the manner that Alan Hardy describes. I must say that I am impressed with his writing styles and the layout of this short novel. It takes a very special kind of storyteller to present a potentially offensive piece in such an artistic manner. Granted, there were times I felt myself blush; however, the symbolism was apparent throughout the novel. In fact, I looked forward to the layering of characters and events during the match. Wonderful piece, Mr. Hardy!
B0054JZC6E|4.0|kind of addicting. the games are short and simple. this makes it easy to pick up where you left off at any time.
1580176941|5.0|Wonderfully written with great easy to follow advice.  The illustrations are absolutely lovely and very inspiring.  No need to buy another cookie decorating book.  Particularly useful with regard to making and use of royal icing.
B008S4YZCO|5.0|This game has it all,tycoon,cuteness,battle! A big 5 stars and a marvelous 2 Thumbs Up! Another great game by Gameloft!
B00000ITOY|5.0|My daughter loves this! The colors are really vibrant and she likes to do different things with the different shapes. I would recommend this.
B003F3NE1Q|5.0|purchased this for my daughter for Christmas. it arrived promptly and I had enough time to mail it to her so that she got it in time.
B00973DDN2|5.0|I was honestly reminded of Bruce Springsteen. I love this album. The songwriting is optimistic without being sappy, and passionate without being cliche. Brandon Flowers delivers it with power, and the synths create a dream-like, wondrous background behind his voice for my ears to revel in. Has this band always been this good?
0385335997|5.0|This series is an excellent read or audio adventure.  Please begin at the first novel/audio in the series and read each in turn.  The books are a marvel of fantasy, characters,love, family, romance, history and adventure.  The series is the best I have ever read and the individual books are part of my all-time favorites.
B004DLPXAO|4.0|It comes up on  my phone well. Had some problems transferring from computer to phone but finally worked. Easy to download from the site.
8862931921|4.0|I will be using this as a journal.  I am super excited about using it!  I love it, and am enjoying using it.  This is the first moleskine that I have ever purchased so I had high expectations.  The only thing that I am really disappointed about is the thinness of the pages.  My pens don't directly bleed through, but I can easily see the writing through the other side of the page.  I will only be writing on one side of the page.
B0070Y46UY|4.0|It took a while to get into this book as the beginning builds who Pi is, his life, and his affinity for religion.  Once in the boat, however, this was an amazing adventure!  Definitely a twist at the end, which only intensifies the story telling epic!
B003JTHXOK|5.0|A must read. I don't usually read Sparks because I find him depressing but this is a fabulous book. I can`t wait for the movie. PLEASE don't let me down.
B00AIQP9DE|4.0|Good game. Mostly easy but not without some challenges. Hidden searches are simple and includes zoom. Worth $2.99 for Kindle version.
B0064T6LV8|5.0|My husband & I love this game! It is so much fun! no dislikes at all!! Would recommend it to anone who likes playing games.
B005ZOBNOI|5.0|This novel is about a teenager and cancer and love and friendship and so much more.  The story is compelling and emotional and at times, humorous.  I will try some of Mr. Green's other novels since I liked this one so much.
B00AA0TJO8|5.0|this was the best app I have ever played I really think you should get this It is worth every penny
B0017SWPXY|5.0|This was a wonderful book full of likeable characters and real life feelings. I am an animal lover to begin with and this book verified my belief that animals know more about our feelings than we realize. I thoroughly enjoyed the book from cover to cover.
B004JZBGWI|5.0|I love the note pad!  My husband & I leave each other little notes everyday & also reminders. I would definately recommend it!!
1250027624|5.0|A wonderful book.  It makes the characters, their surroundings, and the era come alive.  I frequently go back to the book and just look at the pictures.  What a pleasure.
1594487154|5.0|What do we have in common? We are all human, we eat, we breathe, and we sell. I can hear the sharp intake of breath by many of you in my circles of influence.<br /><br />How dare you say, we all sell? Could it possibly be true?<br /><br />Do designers sell? Do engineers sell? Do geeks sell? Do scientists sell? Do professional women sell? Do entrepreneurs sell? Do CEOs sell? Do those involved in creative thinking sell? Isn't selling sleazy by nature? I can see the discomfort upon your professional faces.<br /><br />In Daniel H. Pink's latest book, To Sell Is Human, The Surprising Truth About Moving Others, he demonstrates that we are spending upward of 40 percent of our time on the job to moving others. You are persuading, convincing, and influencing others to give up something in exchange for something you have.<br /><br />Selling has changed more in the last ten years than it did over the previous hundred. Dan Pink provides insight into the underlying assumptions about sales that no longer work because they are an ancient as a manual typewriter and a Rolodex. Daniel H. Pink will open your eyes to an authentic system of moving others to part with resources to accomplish your goals.<br /><br />If you are trying to convince your superiors that your latest project is worthy of funding, then read To Sell Is Human. If you are in a professional role and want that next promotion then read this book.<br /><br />If you are a scientist attempting to secure your next grant, then Dan Pink will provide you with strategies to secure it.<br /><br />If you consider yourself to be in a non-sales position, (I am thinking of my friends who are geeks, engineers, in organizational development, and creatives) then To Sell Is Human was written just for you. You will find the information highly useful to your professional success.<br /><br />For those of you, who are experts in selling, let me assure you that you will learn a much more effective approach to selling when you read To Sell IsHuman. The way we were taught is outmoded because the environment has changed significantly with the prevalence of social media and social networking combined with smart phones.<br /><br />Think about it! If you are spending approximately 24 minutes of every hour attempting to move others to do something for you, then it makes sense to gain access to a strategic tool kit to learn how to move others more effectively.<br /><br />Begin your New Year in the best possible way, read Daniel H. Pink's latest book, To Sell Is Human, and learn the surprising truth about moving others! You will thank him for improving your ability to accomplish your professional goals.<br /><br />I received a copy of the book from the publisher, but the opinions expressed in this review are my own and have not been edited or approved by anyone.
0385751060|5.0|This book came in great shape in time for Xmas.  My son is really enjoying this book which he is reading for school
B00AHSIQWE|4.0|Good movie, good special effects, but did slow down in middle of movie, this made the movie a little too long for my taste, could have been shorter and more action with Bane, did not see him very often, this did not make him out to be the super bad guy I was expecting. But still a good movie to watch
B003JTHXOK|3.0|The book was a typical Nicholas Sparks book, girl finds boy falls in love than tragedy strikes. Overall, it was predictable and safe.
B009KHDT0C|4.0|Dark Shawdows, I loved it..but then I love Tim Burton movies and of course Johnny Depp,  I also loved the parody on Dark Shawdows...I watched it back in the day.
B0085KGHI6|5.0|Thankfully this event and it's subsquent taping/recording occurred prior to the digital/twitter age. Otherwise the insuing riot/stampede that would have occurred would have overshadowed the performance itself. I saw Muddy Waters a couple of years before this event took place, and had seen the Stones previosly as well. It was interesting to see how energetic Muddy was, and how reserved/respectful the Stones were. If you appreciate the Blues and it's influence on the Rock Genre, this performance is a well worthwhile addition to your collection.<br /><br />Aside from the Mick/Muddy duets, Keith & Ron Wood guitar riffs, the additional Chicago Bluesmen (Buddy Guy, Junior Wells, & Lefty Diz) make this one helluva jam! Too bad the CD doesn't include all the material covered on the DVD. Again this is a worthwhile addition to one's collection if no other reason it was a once in a lifetime event. Chicago still buzzes with anticipation of a similar occurrance everytime the Stones come to town.
B002MFX0RQ|5.0|Truly one of the great performances of James Stewart and Josephine Hull. This will have an honored place in my comedy collection of dvd's.
B002QKZLZ6|5.0|does what its made for. Which is holding the bluetooth. No trouble out of it works great. Yeah Come ON
B007EECSFA|5.0|There's very little I can say that hasnt been said in the other reveiws....  It was a beautiful story and a beautifully written story.  And it took all of my will power to not flip to the end to see how it ends, but knowing that if I did so I'd miss 1/2 the important details.  I'll admit, I'm a bit cheap about buying books.  I would always go to the library vs. Barnes and Noble, and even know with a kindle, I tend to gravitate to libray loans or inexpensive books.  Well.. you get what you pay for :)  I know a lot of the cheaper books are self published so you don't have the publisher getting a cut, but you also miss out on the editing a lot of times.  And I just learned that when there's only a smattering of reviews, some might be paid reviews.  The overwhelming number of 4 and 5 store reviews helped validate for me that I was getting a wonderful book, so I have do do my part and reveiw as well.  And it's one of the books I can't waitt to tell other people about when they ask \\"Have you read any good books lately\\"<br /><br />As a side note, I also realized that I tend to reveiw a book based on how much I paid for it.  ie... it might be a 4 star book if I only paid $1.99 for it, but if I'd paid $9.99 I would have had higher expectations.
B007PTJOV0|5.0|peps world is very fun and just like Mario! peps world is very out there!! and your kids will love it!
B004H1V5RU|5.0|Teaches you patience.  Mind bender.  Super fun and challenging.  Highly recommend it to young and old alike as it will intrigue all ages!
B00A1EOBJQ|5.0|Got this a gift for daughter in law and she loves it! Great Christmas gift and it is what she wanted!
B0090EHVMC|4.0|This is a great show with a lot of positive messages for adults and Children. My toddler loves the singing and the fantastic visual effects.
B000PKG7I4|5.0|Did you ever notice that the cd you don't really like too much becomes the one you love the most over time?  This is the case with Amy's \\"Frank\\".  I thought it was a bit too jazzy for me, but lo...  it is by far her best work.  Pure and clean.  Her most uninhibited works.  Simply astounding, her voice takes flight throughout, unmatched by latter recordings.  By far my favorite Amy Winehouse recording.
B00AJRQLTI|1.0|You can keep your highlights. This is just an advertising ploy. Amazon currently has it at $5.00 as a loss leader against the iTunes store. I wouldn't pay any more, in fact I won't pay at all.
B007HACDLK|5.0|His best book yet.  Timely.  Really gives insight into Mitch rapp.  I recommend it to every Vince Flynn reader' wonderfull
B003297I1U|5.0|This truck is huge!  This is our first experience with Bruder trucks and we will be acquiring more. This was bought as a gift for a 5yo boy.  Having never seen this in person we depended on all the reviews.  This truck is highly detailed and realistic.  It is made of plastic but after 5 days has remained intact.  In a lot of reviews people have stated that how their kids have quickly broke these trucks.  We did take time to show our 5yo and 6yo how to operate this crane.  They were very excited and really enjoyed the realism of the crane.  They even had a relative show them the appropriate hand signals to operate the crane and almost refuse to move the crane if you don't use the right hand signals. When fully extended the boom reaches over 60 inches so be prepared to have some room.  Even the older kids and several adults have been caught playing with this.  Hint:  don't force anything.  If something isn't working or moving then you are doing something wrong.  Show your kids how to play with it and you will be rewarded with hours of joy.<br /><br />UPDATE!!!  Just wanted to give a 8 month update. This crane has seen a lot of work from building log homes on dressers to moving large loads like the Bruder Bulldozer or GI Joe Tank.  Our 5 year old still gets tons of enjoyment out of this crane.  So far nothing has been broken off of it.  We still believe that proper instruction on toys have saved a lot of destruction.  This crane is kept inside and all kids love playing with it.
0394818237|5.0|Our kids LOVE the Scarry books.  Tons of pictures, and the stories that go with them are great.  We had these growing up and these make a fantastic addition to a home library.
B0019NB9A2|3.0|Back when this movie was made they never had green sceens. This had a good story line to it. Before Battlestar Galactica this was the first Robbie the Robot was the first and than came Lost In Space....
B00AECGQF2|5.0|I love this games so much I could spend an hour playing!!!  so worth the $3.00!! the animation is so great to!!!
B00A3AUGEW|4.0|I don't watch American Idol so I really had no idea who this guy was until I heard &#34;Home&#34; on the radio. He's got a great sounding voice and plays a mean acoustic guitar. So far my favorite song is &#34;Man on the Moon&#34;. I'd recommend this album to anyone who's into this type of music. I even bought a copy of the CD version for my mother!
B004LWZWGK|2.0|I must admit, I was not one of the fanboys that freaked over how amazing \\"The Dark Knight\\" was.  I loved Heath ledger and that version of The Joker is absolutely one of the most iconic performances of all time, but I thought the film could have EASILY been 20 minutes shorter.  \\"TDKR\\" was even more overblown and overwrought.  I tend to judge a comic book film by how good the villain is, and in this case, Bane sucked.  Comic book villains almost always have some murky \\"plan\\" that they want to exercise and their motivations are almost always very muddled.  So, apparently Bane gets together a group of terrorists to first cut off Gotham from the rest of the world so they can let all the criminals out, trap the cops underground, kill all rich people and ultimately nuke the place?  Umm okay.<br /><br />The saving grace here is Anne Hathaway as Selina Kyle/Catwoman and Joseph Gordon Levitt as good guy John Blake.  I found Batman whiny and annoying through most of this film, when he wasn't flat on his back shrieking in pain.<br /><br />I am of the opinion that a hero needs to \\"Rise\\" and stalk hoity-toity directors like Christopher Nolan.  I call this dastardly foe THE EDITOR who will swoop in and slice extraneous plot developments and entire characters.  THIS FILM WAS TOO LONG.  Any impact it may have had was completely destroyed by the number of times I rolled my eyes and checked my watch.  Sometimes, shorter is better.<br /><br />The way it all wrapped up in the end was kinda neat, with the important people being clued in to the truth and Gotham getting an immortal, infallible hero to worship and the whole John Blake / Robin thing.  But it was almost too little too late.
B00AEJM6H2|4.0|I really enjoy this game in my free time, especially the challenges of the arcade. If you're looking for a fun time try this game.
B006BDHAX0|4.0|got this full version after we tried the free version. has more options and levels than the free one, we play ths alot.
B004G5ZY7E|5.0|Tight, thrilling, tough detective drama. If not already, movies will be made. The man is a great talent and I strongly recommend his work to all.
B00AHSIQWE|2.0|Just didn't convince me. It seemed too \\"movie like\\" and unlike the previous dark knight movies just didn't grab me.
B0086700CM|5.0|It is an excellent app . I never get tired of playing. It helps me to release my stress level.
B0058W74UY|1.0|this thing DOES NOT work with kindle as it says it will.it wont play audio files which is the reason i tried it in the first place. not sure if there is one that works for kidle but i havent stopped looking. kidle only works with some files like youtub and things like that. I need a plyer that will work for online college course files and so far no luck. this is not a good app. In MY opinion
B0086700CM|4.0|My 8 year old grand-daughter loves to play this game.  It is fairly non-violent, thus meeting my standards for her to play it at my house.
B009CPJHY4|4.0|sweet movie that brings a smile to your face. A nice way to see that life continues, changes, but continues
B00AA0TJO8|5.0|I, of course, am no authority.  I keep a lookout on amazon for anything unique and different...like many of you.  Epic is...well...&quot;EPIC&quot;!  Who would have thought we'd be drawing our own doodles and watch them come to life in a well thought out story/game interactive.  If you're looking for something special and have an ounce of childlike creativity, don't talk yourself out of the enjoyment this little app will deliver...
B0064TVQ5E|3.0|got this to try it out and see how well it worked. did fine but lacked all the options and games the full version has, we updated to the full version after a while. if you only play games like this for a few minutes at a time this is a good app, but for serious players you will want the full version.
B006O6F932|1.0|I have purchased my fair share of Mattel products (Barbie;s, Barbie cars, horses, cars, campers) this is by far the WORST Mattel purchase.<br />Sorry Mattel lovers. Flimsy plastic, too many stickers with no direction as to where they go, everything falls over and out of place. My daughter was so excited and as we set it up, I saw her excited turn to frustration as everything broke or fell off.<br />Are you kidding me that I paid $75 for this thing? It's not worth $30...sorry
B00006J3T4|5.0|He's my favorite musician, but, somehow, this CD got past me (it was released in 2002).  It's full of everything we like about him...
B002PEP4U0|5.0|Makes you appreciate what you have an believe that anything is possible. Well worth the read.  A great inspirational book.
B008HK3XKO|3.0|works ok, its a bit high for what its made of but it keeps the kidle protected just fine and the stand seems to work fine too.
B0079R8KXG|3.0|Nice, bright shade of red (which the recipient likes), however the quality of the outer layer of the product looked cheap.  The kindle fire fit well on the inside, and when you adjusted it to make a stand, it stood up well.  If you are looking for a 'nice' looking case for the fire, this is not it.  I'd recommend spending a bit more.  If you're looking for pure protection and don't care about the visual,  then this can work for you.
B003JTHXOK|4.0|Great love story that kept you wondering what was going to happen.  I couldn't put the book down!  You can't go wrong with Nicholas Sparks.
B009FZHYKU|5.0|Best show out there. It keeps you crawling back for more, and never a dull moment in the shows. A++++ rating
B007MNV5WU|3.0|first game we downloaded to our kindle fire, works great but got bored with it after beating it twice. its a great kids game
B002MQYOFW|5.0|The first book was  awesome!! I couldn't put it down!!!<br />I 'read it from cover to cover in 4 days!!
B004LZRSBY|5.0|Great show, great camera work, great sound, great playlist! A real treat for the true fan! The drummer and the back-up keyboard/bass player were a great addition.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|This book is amazing, I could not put it down. I finished it, literally, in 2 days! The suspense, the courage and Peeta! I love him! :D
B004UID2LC|4.0|works well with the kindle, gives use hours of entertainment when there is nothing on tv to watch and plays videos like a champ.
B004LOMB2Q|5.0|I&acute;m so happy.  I&acute;ve been using Evermore on my laptop and  iPhone a long time.  It's been wonderful to have.  It is easy to learn and use.  It has many useful options.  Also, I could type something on my laptop and immediately download it to my iPhone for on the go.  For the holidays, I received a Kindle Fire.  I just downloaded the Evermore app and immediately got an update of all my docs.  How helpful !!!!
B005ZOBNOI|5.0|Unspeakably profound, funny and charming, and impossibly heartbreaking. Green's most powerful book yet.<br /><br />And yes: I did cry. More than once.
B008H6GH8I|5.0|Really good movie. Focused a lot on types of creatures how to fight them and a new way to turn against umbrella corp.
B0064X7FVE|1.0|got this for my kindle but it doesnt work well, the maps are over an hour behind and no way to update them. not good if your tring to track server weather
B000M2O6AQ|5.0|One takes away from this genre what one is searching for - and then some, sometimes. Yeah the story is &#34;unbelievable&#34; (and that's very subjective) - but if you've danced in this field through &#34;new age&#34; books and seminars this movie puts it into action for one to digest. Maybe there's an &#34;ah ha&#34; moment in it for you – so give it try in these trying times – it may help you with the digest and understanding of the issues on your path.
B005SFS4ZU|5.0|I have seen the Phantom several times on Broadway, and this was by far the must superb performance I have ever seen. I don't agree with some of the reviewers who complained about camera angles and shots - I thought they were magnificent. My only disappointment was that they didn't have the chandelier fall. I was a little unimpressed with the portrayal of Raoul, as I thought he came across a bit cocky and not sympathetic to Christine, but his singing was fantastic. Andre was a little weak. But Christine, the Phantom, the costumes, the staging, the sound, magnificent!! This does Blu Ray justice, and with my Bose sound system, I ended by simply saying, \\"WOW!\\"
B007SGLZP8|4.0|I believe I have read every book John Grisham has written...and enjoyed them all.  This was my least favorite.  While it is a good story, it ties together pieces in such a way that they are just not believable.  Once that occurred I began to lose interest, finding it rather easy to leave it for a day or two.  Nonetheless, for ardent Grisham fans it is far better to buy it than wait another year or two for the next, as it remains a good read.
B001XVD2Z0|5.0|It's easy to see why this movie revolutionized the movies. It was fantastic! The action was great and the storyline was completely new and imaginative.
B00992CF6W|5.0|I love this game!!! I just made a 3 story rainbow house! You can build ANYTHING in this game! I totally recommend this game. My sister, brother, and my step brother also love minecraft pocket edition.awesome app.
B0069G5Z9K|5.0|my favorite game in the amazon app store its addictive. this game has a high replay value due to the fact every level is different and there are tons of extras
B004EPYZZ8|5.0|Great message, made all the better for the fact it is based on a true story!  Our two sons love it.
B00AQ3K8IU|5.0|I love that it had suspense and heartache and true love all wrapped up in one :) great book .
B00AQ3K8IU|5.0|Ill just keep this short, I loved this book! Best ive read in a long time. So intense, I laughed, I cried, I \\"lived\\"! Thank you Mrs. Hoover.
B0054JZC6E|3.0|I am having fun so far but most or all of the games are just quick mini games. It's free so not a problem
B00006LLLN|5.0|I could listen to this CD for hours on end and still want to listen to it again.  Their performance together is truly classic Bluegrass in my mind.
B004O4K4SQ|4.0|I enjoy this game, and I used to play Galaga quite a bit. Most of the weapons are not as useful as the standard cannons, but I appreciate the variety they included. If you enjoy Space Invaders and Galaga, more than likely you will enjoy this game.
B0097EWK3A|4.0|This is one great game, however, I am stuck at the old farmhouse because it won't let me pick up the boomerang. Totally bummed! Up to that point it was the best game I have played in along time. It makes you think, but if you still can't get it you have the hint button. Good mix of ho, puzzles and story. Love that it has a zoom for the ho scenes, a must for the kindle fire so the tab doesn't get in the way. Please make more like this one! I am hoping I can get past this problem or I will have to start over and see if I can get it on the next go around, but if this is a glitch please fix because I want to finish! Would have given it a 5 star if I could have finished.
B00340I4KG|5.0|This was a great movie,  I loved the transition with John Travolta and Nicolas Cage.  Very well thought out movie.
B00AHSMDQY|4.0|I rented this film in HD and streamed it through my Roku player.  I ran into a lot of slowness problems early on (probably due to either my Roku player or my internet connection).  After waiting for the Roku to figure out what was going on, it automatically kicked the video into a lower resolution and it played well.<br />Oh by the way, this movie is awesome! :)
B005MSD6QU|4.0|Ilove the way the characters interact with one another and are a real family through thick and thin. It adds a big dimension to the overall show
B007TBZ63Y|5.0|This book was very engaging and action packed! I couldn't put it down. The plot was exciting with a wicked twist. There are plenty of new mythical challenges for the seven to face. I highly recommend this book for fans of action, fantasy, or Rick Riordan's other books.
B008YWY0HK|5.0|Our family LOVES Brave! Amazing idea, great animation, tons of humor, as well as some touching moments. Great job, Disney!
B00AA0TJO8|3.0|I give this game 3 stars for potential. Unfortunately it won't give me the full screen on my Kindle Fire HD. I can only see the \\"fire Pencil\\" which only gives you the option to burn things including yourself up...<br />Rebooted, didn't fix, uninstalled and reloaded, didn't fix... oh well, uninstalled for now, may try later once they fix the Kindle Fire HD issues...
B000QCQ8Y4|4.0|A little different but a lot of we want from reacher. Great read.  Looking forward to the next in the series
B008673ZAQ|4.0|After reading &#34;Bared to you&#34; I thought that it would be a waste of time to read the second book. For some reason I ended up reading the second book, &#34;Reflected in You&#34; and I thought it was actually not bad. Sure, it is pretty much a rip off of Fifty Shades, but isn't that what readers want? I think the story became more developed, there were several twists and turns, and some more of the character's history is revealed. Nice weekend read.
B005LAIISA|5.0|Great addition to my daughter's DVD collection. Very funny and entertaining. Scrat, as alway, steals the show =) Overall, very good sequel.
B000T9OP7G|5.0|I bought this for my husband for christmas, but to my surprise he already had it so I had to return it.  The product was as described and came in a timely fashion.  My husband enjoys the one he already had.
B003UBTX7C|5.0|A riveting story that holds your attention to the end.  Lots of action, lots of suspense.I enjoyed it very much.
B004EPZ07K|5.0|I am trying to figure out why this film is almost universally panned.  I can only assume that the reviews are from those who have no familiarity with the comic series or those who do not get any enjoyment out of classic pulp comic books.  The only problem with Green Lantern is that it probably stuck too close to the comic series and did not drift off into some \\"Hollywood-esque\\" superhero movie.  The fact is, Green Lantern is a \\"cosmic\\" superhero, and to attempt to portray a movie without incorporating that element would serve a huge disservice to the character.  If the film-makers had tried to keep Green lantern \\"down to Earth,\\" it would have gone against the entire grain of the traditional series.  The fact is, it is just too bad that this superhero movie was just too comic-like for too many people.  I guess they should have darkened it up like Nolan's Dark Knight series, and then all the wannabee fans could rave about how \\"cool\\" it was (note: I am not bashing Nolan's 1st or 2nd Batman film [the 3rd was not that good], just he idea that all superhero movies have to be \\"dark\\" or \\"gritty\\" these days to play to the vast movie going audience).  All in all, Green Lantern was a fun film.  The only real drawback was the colossal build-up to a \\"villain\\" that was so easily defeated.  Maybe they can do a better job with that in the next installment.  Having said that, I think the film deserves at least one more in the series, most obviously following up with Sinestro.  Now, that would be a better overall fight.  If you are a classic comic fan, feel free to enjoy this movie and not get taken in by the \\"hater crowd.\\"  I give it 5 stars to attempt to rebalance the rating and get this film where it should be.  Recommended!
B007MDB6L0|5.0|Our whole family agreed that this 4th part of Tinkerbell animated films is the best. The story line is amazing, very touching. Recommend to everybody of any age!
1594487154|5.0|Lamentably, we live in era in which many best-selling authors mail it in. I won't name names, but some of the most renowned authors out there can publishing anything and sell a slew copies, even though their books at sub-par at best.<br /><br />Not this one.<br /><br />Pink's research and writing style make this an incredibly informative, dare I say groundbreaking, text. I'm not big on sales books, but this one is just remarkable.<br /><br />Get it. Read it. And read it again.
B00AMBK0X4|5.0|The concept is executed perfectly...great lines that can be used in everyday situations!  I can't wait for the sequel to come along...
1452101426|5.0|my daughter was very excited to get it. She is studyng animation<br />so it was perfect for her. Perfect Christmas book!
B008Y1YKE4|5.0|One of the best Christmas &#34;action&#34; animated films! Absolutely in love with the characters and how well the story is written and delivered.
B00APUQJLO|1.0|I'll keep this simple. This movie is crap. The writing is God awful. Surrealist non-sense. I hate these kind of movies that are bankrupt of any logic and characters talking in random statements to one another:<br /><br />\\"What is the meaning of it all?\\"<br />\\"I enjoy the meaning\\"<br />\\"What meaning?\\"<br />\\"I didn't sleep last night.\\"<br />\\"I could go for a haircut.\\"<br /><br />And let me guess it's my fault I couldn't make any sense of the \\"deep symbols\\"<br /><br />Give me a break.<br /><br />This movie is such s***. I would prefer a rectal exam without any lube than watching this horses*** again.<br /><br />Save your time and $$$ and pass on this horses***. Christ, 90% of the movie takes place in limo as Robert Pattinson's character blaps on and on about the most non-sensical s***.<br /><br />Seriously...I would take the pass on this if I were you.<br /><br />Did I mention you should take a pass?
B005CRQ4GU|5.0|Love it make a lot of more I love the whole series jeff you are the best rock on man
0811879631|5.0|my daughter was very excited to get it. She is studyng animation<br />so it was perfect for her. Perfect Christmas book!
B00009W0U4|1.0|This plumbs the pits of Hell. Very disturbing. NOT entertainment.<br />Might inspire psychopaths, but the rest of us will be appalled.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|A real page turner. Every time I thought I had this book figured out it went in a different direction.
B004SJ3BCI|3.0|I'm not completely sure it is a game of skill, seems like it doesn't always matter where you aim, it just repeats itself.  A game more for youngsters.  But the price was right,  Thanks !!
B004OR199G|5.0|Great book, not clinical but fun read.  Kris is an example of how our one size fits all medical approach doesn't work.  Whenever you mention alternative medicine to mainstream dr.s they look at you like you have two heads or not a brain in your head.  Kris is an example of self healing in a desperate time.  When one gets to this point you are desperate and it's a pitty that food as medicine is not even an option for treatment much less prevention from mainstream dr.s.  BE YOUR OWN ADVOCATE FOR YOUR HEALTH ! Traditional medicine is necessary but it isn't the only way to prevent and heal.  Food is cheaper than pills too.:)
B00A3AUGEW|5.0|I really enjoy listening to this album. It is a great showcase of his voice and writing abilities a well as some really nice instrumentals. there is only one song on the album I might consider pop but it's definitely not a sell out song. if you watched him on American Idol you won't be disappointed even though the growl is toned down.
B0031Q0XCA|5.0|I can't say much about the movie without issuing a &#34;spoiler alert&#34;, so I won't go into the plot. It is a well-acted, well-crafted, unique tale of a relationship between two very different people. The movie bounces back and forth in the relationship's timeline, making the plot feel like most of us feel when we look back on the progress of our current relationship or try to make sense of an old one. Also, I think I'm in love with Joseph Gordon-Levitt now.
B00A757EFW|4.0|Always loved Pac-Man on the old Atarie system. ( I'm dating myself!!)<br />Still like it.  But I'm not as quick as I used to be.
B007J4T2G8|5.0|It is the perfect story... a lot of sex and so much Rom as nice... I feel that every woman at some point in their life be ed said to read it...
B00AMBLXP8|5.0|Great movie. It was essentially an extended episode of Family Guy, even with a good story! Very glad I saw it.
B00AMBK6J2|2.0|Maybe I'm missing something but I thought this movie was way overhyped. It had a few funny moments but nothing you missed from the previews.
B007U1FEJE|1.0|Some groups, Eagles, Stones, BonJovi,  can still bring it on, and are worth the price.  This was awful, sounded like a few dead cats in the group.  You guys can's get back together without fighting, leave the public out of it!
B003B02O14|3.0|I'd recommend this book to anyone. Great  read. A little different than most Grisham novels, but well done, as usual.
B007SYWFRM|4.0|Fun for kids. Keeps us adults entertained also. Fun to learn animals and families. Recommended tor kids and anyone with time and likes village games.
B005I6EU7U|5.0|I ordered this for my husband for Christmas for his kindle fire. He already had the sleeve but he would have to pull the whole unit out to use it and with that it could still get scratched or dropped. I LOVE THIS! It looks neat, the leather feels nice, and you can keep it in the case at all times to keep it protected. I would definitely recommend this product!
B007SYWFRM|4.0|I mostly like the game but it has been a little glitchy lately since the last update.  For those people that don't want their children to spend real money it clearly States that it is possible and to activate parental controls.
B008JMKN4Y|5.0|Great. An emotional rollercoaster.  Could no  put my kindle  down until I was finished with it.  Cannot wait until walking disaster come  out.
B009O2XY12|4.0|I saw someone playing this game once, and it really looked like fun.  I have enjoyed playing it, but only gave it 4 stars because of two things: 1. It is really easy to accidentally change the color of the bubble you are shooting next without realizing you have done so, and 2. Sometimes the bubble does not shoot in the direction you tell it to go, or quickly fires off a second one without your having meant to do so.  However, still a BUNCH of fun!
B009YP9L7U|2.0|Not enough depth, but was a cute short read over the holidays. They really should not require so many words for a review!!
B0079R8KXG|2.0|Although the case looks nice and is light weight, it really doesn't work well.  First, if you try to use it as a stand it won't stay in position as there are no locking channels like most other stand covers have.  Second, when you use it that way it stresses the stitching and wrinkles the cover.  After a few months of use it has failed. Check other covers made by Marware, many of them get rave reviews.
B0074ALZ7Q|4.0|This book was recommended to me as &#34; The Romantic Novel &#34; to read. And as the Author says in the after word of the book, a reader can see it in two ways, romantic and thought provoking. I am one of the latter. It reminds one, that many years ago, a relationship was not just &#34; red roses and sunshine&#34; . That marrying into a certain social society was harsh. The book had a good twist, good story, was very descriptive and one got feel what the character went through.... Reading the afterword, gives one a better sense of what Daphne Du Maurier was accomplishing with the book.
B008JGSM6G|5.0|This game is one that encourages you to think as you play.  Definitely one I would like to see my kids playing than others.  However, if you tend to get frustrated easily, it may not be for you.  At any rate - if it is a free app - DEFINITELY worth trying!
B008XG1X18|5.0|I am not sur what I did for recipes, crafting ideas, decorations etc., before I discovered Pinterest.  The app makes the site even more user friendly.  Love it!
B0094BB4TW|2.0|Facebook is a good way to keep in touch with friends but the constant &#34;suggestions&#34; are annoying at best. I do not appreciate being constantly bombarded with advertisements and notifications telling me what other people like.
0307592731|5.0|I purchased this for my mother.  I think she was surprised to get it, since she had not mentioned the book.  That being said, she started reading it and is having trouble putting it down!  Glad I followed my gut on this and bought it for her!
B0064TVQ5E|4.0|the real challange is to clear all titles in under 4 minutes . Like the pause feature;<br />would recomend to average Mahjong player
B000OZ0NXA|5.0|I am in the proacess of reading all the Lee Child's &#34;Reacher&#34; series. I like them all. If you like to read mysteries. These are as good as any. .
B003TSEEDY|5.0|I read this book several years ago and loved it and decided to refresh my memory of it before seeing the film adaptation..I enjoyed it just as much the second time and hope that the movie is good too.
B005OCFGTO|5.0|I bought this movie set for my son, per his request.  He has already started the Harry Potter marathon since we got quite a snowstorm here!  The transaction was quick and the price I paid was more than fair!
B00AMBM9MO|2.0|The movie has some very funnt moments, but overall it just isn't very good.  A solid two stars, maybe two and a half.
B000P0J09W|5.0|I am a sucker for older movies, and this was a great buy that I couldnt pass up. Cheap price and the product came very fast! The movie was sealed and not scratched. Could not have got a better deal anywhere else.
B008JMKN4Y|5.0|Was unsure if I would get through this book. I had started it and then just never got back to it. Sooo glad I ha e it a second try. I can't remember the last book I read that made me laugh out loud, cry, and keep me hanging on for more.  Looking forward to \\"Walking Disaster\\"<br />,
0385363141|5.0|My girlfriend is happy, the story begins with sexual situations but develops with other perspectives of the protagonist OK OK
B00AMBLDEE|4.0|Great movie but not as good as the previous Bourne Ultimatum. Starts off slow but eventually builds in intensity. Ending leaves the door open for the next part
B001AGXEAG|5.0|I am a sucker for old movies, and this was a great buy that I couldnt pass up. Cheap price and the product came very fast! The movie was sealed and not scratched. Could not have got a better deal anywhere else.
B008MG1E4A|5.0|A rare and clear look into the life of a very high level performer.  Thanks for inviting us into your world, Mr. Owen.
B00005JO9J|4.0|My girlfriend is happy with the DVD. She likes it and plays all day until your eyes get tired OK
034580404X|2.0|A real 'teenage' male fantasy written by unrealistic female.  Not sure of any male, except<br />Drugged out porn star, would/could accomplish these actions over and over and over
B000002A46|5.0|The CD arrived very quick, and came just as though I bought it from the store. Must be the best holiday CD out, even though it has a few years on it ;)
0896898288|5.0|I have made this quilt. Yes, it is difficult and time consuming. The instructions give clear directions with regard to printing the templates from the included CD. Most printers resize before printing, but this is easy to override. This is not a quilt for a beginner unless they have access to a good support network of seasoned quilters who can guide them through some very advanced techniques. The book alone is beautiful and an interesting conversation starter if you like &#34;coffee table&#34; books.
0385363133|5.0|My girlfriend is happy, the story begins with sexual situations but develops with other perspectives of the protagonist OK OK
B003UAKE9Y|5.0|I love to watch this movie not only around Halloween but all year long! Its a great story with beautiful and artistic stop motion imagery. I suggest watching the video on Youtube called &#34;Coraline: The Biggest Smallest Movie Ever Made&#34; about the making of the movie.
1451695195|3.0|I found it to be an interesting story but I did not care for the back and forth style of writing between time lines.
B003TSEEDY|2.0|This book was okay, but definitely not what I was expecting. It has a good story line but I felt it could have a little more background before the book starts. I really like how the book is written as letters because I felt it added to the story. Everyone has an opinion and I feel you should read it and make your own.
B004XJRQUQ|4.0|I really liked this trilogy...there are a lot of horrible things that happen to such a young girl but the books are well written. I am not sure that it is something the very young should read.
B004MC0FO8|5.0|I love this app and use it very often. Every time i'm in the car or around music, I make sure I have it open in case I hear a song I like! And I LOVE all the options it gives you once you tag a song, such as listen to it, share it, watch the Youtube video, lyrics, tour info, recommendations, discography, ringtones, etc. There isn't one thing they didn't think of!
0345803485|5.0|I know that people say its mommy porn. I love it! I never rad and i was super into this book. COULD NOT put it down!!!!
B00A0SJWQU|4.0|Critical review for this flick was not strongly positive.  I decided to watch it and was not disappointed. The special effects were high quality (IMO) and the story was reasonably coherent. Not sure why it didn't garner stronger support from audiences.  I will watch it again...
B0098VYKSA|3.0|Beautiful movie but not too exciting. You watch just to watch. Good special effects. Beautiful scenes but mostly a dark movie.
0525953728|5.0|I do not write reviews all that often but I felt compelled to write one for this book based on how much I enjoyed reading it.  I am an average speed reader and I was able to read this book over 2 days of on/off reading.  It was hard for me to put the book down; needless to say, it was an easy and enjoyable read.<br /><br />I am a weapons buff myself and I enjoyed how the author included details on the weapons he used on his 'tasks' or deployments and even included some pictures of said weapons.  Little did I know, these SEALs are allowed to pick the appropriate tools to get the job done and I enjoyed learning the selection by the author.<br /><br />If I had to provide one piece of criticism, I would say that less than half of the book is actually devoted to the firsthand account of killing UBL. If you are reading this book for that sole purpose, prepare yourself to wade through a long lead up of the author's career as a SEAL.  However, I found all these details very interesting and enjoyed learning about the career life of an elite SEAL.<br /><br />Buy it. Read it. You will enjoy it.
B008Y1YFNU|5.0|I really like old PaPa Roach stuff, but this is good too. Its kinda tech sounding, but it totally works!
B008JGSM6G|3.0|The game is fun.  But if you kid plays it, there are options to make in-app purchases which did not require a password.  Our daughter was playing and she isn't old enough to read.  So she inadvertently bought '50 coins' or something like that.  Luckily it was only $1.  I've since disabled in-app purchases on my Kindle Fire.
B009HV2JT8|4.0|All in all I like this movie.  It's a fancified retelling of Abraham Lincoln's tale and rise to power.  It has it's moments and pretty awesome action moments.  Watched it with my girl friend and we both enjoyed it.
B0091REZMW|5.0|I'm not sure what it is but I can not stop playing. It's good stuff especially for a free game. The only thing that really frustrates me is how fast your energy depletes vs how long it takes for it replenish. Other than that it's golden. I definitely recommend it if you're into the &quot;found objects&quot; games.
B000VKJ6VS|2.0|Its partially my fault, someone told me that I'd like it, and its just not my style. Not tosay that they're bad, but I am more into Metallica and Shinedown.
0517548232|5.0|Took a Macro class and wanted some basic background info. This book is a must read. If you haven't, purchase it.
B00AMBK6J2|2.0|Cute movie. Had very funny moments. Predictable but then what did I expect about a movie with a talking stuffed animal.
B009YP9L7U|4.0|Gets your attention right from the start.  I didn't want to put it down.  It was a very easy read.
0345803507|5.0|I just did NOT want this book to end! I totally want to hear a book in his perception! So interesting!
B006LSZECO|4.0|If you're looking for an entertaining read with some surprises- Gone Girl fits the bill. Well written and hard to predict this is a great novel describing the twisted relationship of a young married couple. Buy this book- you'll be very entertained.
B005IZLPKQ|5.0|Great movie, good for the entire family. Bought it for my husband as an anniversary present. Product arrived quickly and in good shape.
B005S9EKCW|5.0|This adaptation is simply amazing! I was blown away by the tallent of the actors. The vocal tallents far supassed my expectations. I have seen it twice since it opened and plan on seeing it at least twice more over the next two weeks. The attention to detail is amazing. The characters were believable and the raw emotion expressed through song was outstanding.
0345803493|5.0|I could not read fast enough! I think all three books are equally as good! Each one I just could NOT put down! MORE MORE MORE!!!!
B007TBZ63Y|5.0|I started this series after reading the Percy Jackson and I love the expansion from just the Greek camp to including Romans that was one of the things I found flawed about the Percy Jackson series but now it's all cleared up.  If you enjoy Rick Riordan's other books this one will not disappoint.
B007T2XC7A|5.0|Have been a big fan since the first cd.  This collection does not fail to impress, the voice and styling of Norah's music has always been enjoyable.
B003TSEEDY|5.0|A true coming of age story that will make you think back to when you were that age and all the things you experienced.
B000OONQ9O|5.0|Love this movie. It's one of my cult favorites, just like the Terminator. I can watch this over and over again and never get tired of it!
B007SYWFRM|3.0|Anyone who's played games on FB has played at least a dozen just like this one...<br />Farmville,Farmtown etc. .. they're all the same. This is nothing special, just another way to waste time :)
B004LWZWGK|5.0|This was a great movie. My husband loves it. It's one of his favorites. I love how we can watch it on our computer and our phones.
B003TSEEDY|5.0|It's breathtaking how many life lessons can be crammed into one piece of literature. Despite the fact that high end vocabulary is scarce the lessons and felling Charley emits are as deep as ever.<br /><br />Love this book!<br /><br />Ps, I'm 13!!! B-day soon!!
B008Y2FRFO|4.0|Love it! Great game! Only wish you could get more coins without having to pay for it. Love the prizes, plays just like at a fair.
B005LAII08|5.0|This Five Disc Edition meets all our viewing posibilities. We can now view in 3D, Blueray and on our ipods and ipads. Everywhere we go this movie goes with us. It is an excellent movie as all Disney movies tend to be. A great story with a super message for children and families.
B006LSZECO|3.0|Even though you can guess the outcome it was suspenseful.This book was chosen as a read in our book club.
B007IXWKUK|5.0|Such a good books, has a great story line and is romantic. I can't wait to read the next book
B000VBIGD6|5.0|Love the holiday classics for any age.  Thoroughly enjoyed time and time again.  Gotta love Chevy Chase.  Classics, epic and funny as hell.
B00AMBK0X4|1.0|I think I laughed twice. Not even sure why I watched the whole thing. I guess if you like movies that involve lots of drugs and getting promotions for public indecency then this is your movie but I just wasn't impressed at all.
B0063IH60K|5.0|I can play this game all day from my new kindle that was a christmas gift from my brother 2012
B000JPRPAO|1.0|Amazon download was taking four hours to download. I canceled and downloaded from Apple in minutes. This has happened before with Amazon.<br />Prime free search is slow and or completely stalled
B00005QCVY|1.0|We got just into the movie and it stopped.  Was not able to watch the movie.  The movie must have been a reject.
B001MW0J2Y|5.0|Absolutely amazing. Deep soul touching music. Every single song has intense meaning. For those that do not knoe, if you play Enouhh of Me and One more of Me simultaniously (as they are meant to be played)--the result is mind blowing.
B000002LAC|5.0|Some of the best harmony i've ever heard. Emily lou Harris was so great it brought tears to my eyes and heart.
B009A9EQL6|5.0|For all you pompous airchair idiots out there, if you don't like ballads, click &#34;Next.&#34;  If you are offended that Aerosmith collaborated, then go write your own songs.  Leave Aerosmith alone.  They did a great job on this album and it is enjoyable.<br /><br />And to put things into perspective, when I play the album &#34;Toys In The Attic&#34;, I don't love ALL of the songs.  Do you?
B009ZZDNT6|1.0|There is no indicator as to how to change the hour on the clock.  There should be a way to make this simpler.
B007SGLZP8|5.0|The book was intriguing and very interesting.  I enjoyed the twist in the plot and how the characters carried it out.
B008JGSM6G|5.0|thought it was a kids game and almost didn't download. but once I started playing it I couldn't put it down.  luv it!
B000NYT1M6|3.0|Son really likes it, but everything is plastic and kind of cheap.  I will expect the doors to be ripped off soon.
B007FEFLTO|4.0|Read the first in the trilogy first before this one. You will benefit from the continuity. Even though long, this writer is a wonderful storyteller and you find you do not want it to end.
B0083SBMBM|5.0|once again this is a great movie lots of action great actors this movie falls right into place with all the avenger movies story lines its down side it should only come in full screen .
B001KQZ7I8|5.0|Every human being should read this book. It opened my eyes in an extremely thought provoking way. Highly recommended! Read it, you won't be sorry.
B005LLX582|3.0|Need to watch it again, now that I understand the relationship between the characters.<br />It was very long and confusing.  Exciting at times, boring at others.<br /><br />I want to watch it again to appreciate the deeper spiritual messages in it.
B009SJ3GUK|5.0|American horror story season 1 was much better but asylum was good too. As long as tate/kit/Evan stays I'll watch it till the end!! ;)
B009329ZF2|5.0|great movie lots of action .the only thing i can say is i wish all movies would come only in full screen.
B007URVZJ6|5.0|This book was an invaluable resource in walking me through the process as I prepared to publish my first book. It's a simple and clear resource that anyone will benefit from.
B00AMBK0X4|2.0|Once you get past the basic premis of a teddy bear talking, swearing, smoking, etc., there is not much else to this movie.  You would have to buy into the premis that this could actually happen to enjoy the story.  Poorly written, weak storyline, predictable humor.  Skip it and watch Caddy Shack for the 100th time.  You'll laugh more.
B00AO2P3GA|2.0|Wont let me install it says it has a problem or something. I had to pay for it like everybody else and I would like to play it. please help!
B00A8ECU24|1.0|in order to pass the quests on the game you need to find friends on gameloft. however android has a glitch and the friends don't show up so the game is impossible to beat. plus it never pays out the pink diamonds or they just disappear. therefore you need to spend about $100 of your own money to beat the game
030788743X|5.0|This book really struck a cord with the geek in me.  If you've every wandered around in the strange world of Second Life, you'll see this as the possible future!  Instantly you'll like the characters and the story line.  Suffice it to say, if you like computers, online game play and good old fashioned fun, this book is for you.
B004CEUEWE|3.0|If you like this movie, you'll love Heat.  While I liked this movie, it is a basic rip off of Heat.  It's still woth the view, but Heat is much better.
B00A8ECU24|4.0|Good:<br />To begin, the gameplay is very smooth, and is rarely needed to be force closed. Next, things like expansions, ponies, and new stores are priced well. It doesnt take someone forever to save up for them. Lastly, I like how every four to five days of gameplay, you earn free gems as part of the daily bonus.<br />Bad:<br />I am a huge My Little Pony: Friendship is Magic fan. I noticed (and I may be wrong) that Big Mcintosh's name is spelled Big McIntosh, and DJ Pon-3's cutie mark is morphed slightly so it now looks like cherries instead of an eighth note. My other issue that is probably more important is that I payed $5 for gems, and I never received them. This irritated me very much.<br />Overall, this is a very good game that any brony/pegasister would love.
B0094BB4TW|2.0|I've used the iOS Facebook app for years now, dealing with its misguided attempt at working through html5 and every other little quirk and annoyance that came with it. Finally, it was made into a legitimate app and became infinitely better. Still not perfect by any means, but much better.<br /><br />After using this app on my Kindle Fire for three days, I'm ashamed to admit that I'm pining for that iOS version. Heck, even the old, buggy version would be an improvement on this.<br /><br />The news feed doesn't update properly and constantly switches itself back to &quot;Top Stories&quot; no matter how many times I switch it to &quot;Most Recent.&quot; Viewing a picture gets the app stuck on that picture unless I rapidly tap the back button several times, which in turn reverts the feed to whatever sorting system it seems to like. It also has a tendency to randomly scroll itself back to the top of the news feed, which is a pain if I've scrolled down very far. I haven't yet had the problem that others are reporting, with only being able to see a few items in my feed, but I'm sure it'll pop up eventually.<br /><br />Facebook, fix this. This is absolutely ridiculous. You're a billion dollar company focused on making the world more connected. The least you could do is put out a halfway decent app.
B007IXWL2C|5.0|I was majority suprised that I could not stop reading this series. Great plot behind the obvious. Read all three and wish there were more.
B007FJFDXS|5.0|Great game, but I got it for free. It is a fun and challenging game but looks nice while playing too. ★★★★★
B00AJRQLTI|5.0|I wish the CD included more songs, like &#34;A Little Fall of Rain&#34; and &#34;Lovely Ladies,&#34; but whatvs, its a great album
B007PT3QOQ|1.0|the game is great however latest update put my expanded land and work back into forest.  all that time is now wasted.  I can no longer expand.  fix these and it will be 5 stars
B000QDA7OU|5.0|I seldom watch a movie twice, but this one I've watched probably thirty times over the years, and have been captivated by it each time. Anyone interested in the spiritual life will find much to ponder in this movie, even though the form of Catholicism portrayed has mostly disappeared. Even that is something to ponder. The dialogue is rich and deep, and I pick up a new lesson each time I watch the movie. Fantastic movie! And don't stop there. You gotta kind of wonder what happened to the nun after the movie ended. They say truth is often stranger than fiction, and I found this to be true. I kind of had a difficult time coming to grips with it, but finally I learned much from it, as with the movie. Start by researching the author: Kathryn Hulme.
B000OZ0NXA|5.0|I recently saw the Jack Reacher movie at the theater and became intrigued with the character. When I learned the story was based on a series of novels, I purchased the first one on my Kindle. I couldn't put it down. The story is well-paced, and the characters are well-developed. Best of all, the writing is smooth and intelligent. I am excited to have a long list of Lee Child books to keep me busy over the winter months.
B0099Y2YL6|5.0|The acting, the wonderful wardrobe, the backgrounds in the house, and in the field and surroundings are awesome.  Very well done.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|GET IT NOW it is awesome does not take long to download awesome I love it if u have anything u can get it on just get it
B008GFI3QE|5.0|I just finished watching this most enjoyable Blu-ray Dvd about George Martin.  I am always fascinated watching what famous people have done in their lives.  This was especially interesting for me because he is English.  It starts with his childhood to present day.  He was and still is an most amazing music producer and turns out to be a most amazing pianist too which I never knew. I am glad that he shared his amazing life with us; he worked in the early days of radio and recording; he worked with some amazing and talented artists.  He certainly has had a full life.  Thank you Amazon for carrying this amazing Blu-ray Dvd.
B007VYQ6DS|5.0|I love chimps so it was almost a given that I would love this movie. It isn't an in-your-face loud movie but<br />a thoughtful, reflective portrayal of a chimps life. Sweet.
B009NPK1IO|5.0|When my son said, \\"Mom, I have a new TV series for you to start - 'Gossip Girl'..\\"  I adamantly refused!! The name totally turned me off! Too teeny bopper-ish, I said..lol... I have NEVER been more wrong! The first season had me totally,100%, enthralled! After the 5th episode, I was ADDICTED... No joke...<br />  It had something for EVERYONE - male and female, young and old, alike.. With so many lead characters, one is BOUND to remind you of yourself. And, I guarantee you will relate to MOST plot lines!!<br />  Six seasons..... I finished them in just 3-4 months.. Don't let this one pass you by!!!!!!!!!
B0029XFNA8|5.0|Top 5 movies. Can watch this all year.  Over and over again, week to week to week, month to month,<br />year to year
B009FZFONO|5.0|What can I say? It's the 'Walking Dead'! We have been fans of DD (Norman Reedus) since his Boondock Saints days....this show is great entertainment and highlights the current Zombie craze.
0316776963|5.0|David Sedaris delivers once again. His take on life and the every day happenings in his family<br />are so wildly absurd, yet somehow believable, that you never want his books to end.
B00AMBK0X4|5.0|Great role for Mark Wahlberg and great lines throughout the entire movie. One of the best comedies of the year.
B001E5CH0G|5.0|Daughter loves it. This probably the only Will Ferrell movie I consider watching<br />more tha once. It bring more magic to the season
B00AQF8CJ0|5.0|Very fun addictive game. Very fun addictive game. Very fun addictive game.<br /><br />Very fun addictive game. Very fun addictive game. Thank you.<br /><br />Very
B0063IH60K|5.0|I love this app. It's great for passing time. why pay when you can get this app for free? only one add per game too.
B003JTHXOK|4.0|Although pretty predictable, this was a believable story with rich characters. I do not get into Nicholas Sparks too much but this was a good one.
B0058SNKRY|5.0|OK.  I'm against the idea of crocs.  However, a friend of mine spoke highly of hers for a very specific purpose: Backpacking.  They float, they have a toe, they're light, they're waterproof, all of these things make them great for fording rivers or in camp.  I conceded her point, then continued making fun of her (standard issue) crocs.  However, when the time came for me to replace my trusty tevas, I decided to go with crocs, for the above reasons, and the fact that they're probably about a third of the weight of my old tevas.<br /><br />OMG I'm so glad I did.  I haven't even taken them backpacking yet, but I can definitely say that I love them.  Embarrassingly so.  I even wore them to my grandmother's funeral.
B008JGSM6G|5.0|This game is way too addictive.  I got my first tablet for Christmas, and its all I've been doing since then.
0812993357|5.0|If you want to see how Grace looks at age 72, Google her name and see the picture galleries. With her long mop of flaming red hair, her white face, aquiline nose and  hooded dark eyes, she's a dead ringer for Queen Elizabeth  I. Grace  rules a kingdom, too, that of fashion, but like other reviewers have noted, her  bland biography is missing the beef. The biography is worth the price for its delightful little sketches by Grace herself and the fascinating vintage photographs. Since this reviewer is as physically as far from a fashion model as one can get, I was hoping for something deliciously catty that would reveal the fashion world in all its colors and all its faults, the jealousies, the back-biting the ruthless competition. Nevertheless, I thoroughly enjoyed \\"A Memoir.\\"<br /><br />Grace had an astounding childhood in northern Wales where it was so foggy and cold she had rheumatism as a little girl. Her family lived in an annex of a hotel, running the hotel as a rocky business as the only clients came in August when it was warm enough.<br /><br />Grace left home at age 18 and never looked back. Grace almost sounds that as a model she  emerged from the head of Athena, fully formed, and yet that is almost true. From an early age she had a sense of style, but most important the body to go with it, bust and hips 33, waist 18 and long elegant legs. She will describe her early years as a model somewhat dispassionately, mentioning casually along with many other obscure names the non-obscure Tony Armstrong Jones, who photographed her, the non-obscure Prince of Wales  and the even more non obscure Queen. She confides at one point that Tony was very friendly at first, (call me Tony) but  if you stepped over the line he'd say \\"Snowdon, actually.\\" The reader, if nosy like me, was dying to know what was over the line. I think the laid-back tone and lack of passion in her writing style are what other reviewers in Amazon are criticizing. There is a steady parade of people in her life- the designers, hair stylists, makeup artists  and photographers, many of whom are mentioned in the Memoir and the list becomes less a litany than a bore, to many reviewers.<br /><br />Grace married twice, first to a Chinese. A serious relationship with a Vietnamese lasted five years, Grace got around a great deal. Her first boyfriend was Jewish, and one of her favorite photographic shooting places was in the Caribbean, where the black population looked richly perfect against the tropic sands and seas. No one could ever accuse Grace of being a racist.<br /><br />With her extraordinary talent and the wind at her back, the only way Grace could sail was up. Her tenure as creative director of \\"Vogue\\" launched her into a world wide celebrity. Her sensational appearance in \\"The September Issue\\" made the publicity shy Grace an icon. Nevertheless, I believe Grace has an aversion to blowing her own  horn too loudly. She says \\"I'm no good at famous people.\\" Those critical of her Memoir complain that she only waxes enthusiastic in talking about her many cats.(I love cats, too, and can sympathize). She also says \\"I'm kind of blurry..every time I'm the center of attention.\\" Highly imaginative but down to earth, she refuses to get a face lift. Somehow you get the impression from \\"A Memoir\\" that not only is Grace Coddington  modest, she has a sharp sense of humor and when all is said and done, she is quite lovable.r life- the designers, hair stylists, makeup artists  and photographers, many of whom are mentioned in the Memoir and the list becomes less a litany than a bore, to many reviewers.<br /><br />Grace married twice, first to a Chinese.

B005F9TQ4C|4.0|When this album was released in 1976, the critics didn't know what to amke ofd it, even though stylistically, it wasn't that much different from ``Desire,'' the album that preceded it. His lyrics were sometimes obscure, particularly in ``Changing of the Guard,'' but Dylan built his rock career with obscure lyrics. The horns, which Dylan had rarely used, fit the tunes, most of which chronicle a dissolving romance - his final breakup with his wife probably figures in here. Sometimes, musically, this points toward his gospel phase, although most of the songs don't explicitly address religion, like ``Slow Train Coming.'' Again, the critics attacked him for those themes in his next three albums, but anyone paying attention to ``John Wesley Harding'' and several early songs, shouldn't have been surprised.<br />The critical attacks led me to pass this album by when it came out, and I'm sorry I did. While not a great classic like his mid-60s releases, or the deeply personal ``Blood on the Tracks,'' this is better than such later duds as ``Infidels,'' which the critics praised, or ``Under the Red Sky'' and ``Down in the Groove.'' Check it out.
B007J4T2G8|5.0|Intriguing book. It kept me reading until the end. Could not put it down! I can not wait to read next.
0345803485|3.0|I didn't have any problems with the seller.  The book was mailed promptly, however, the story line was over-rated, and I found the book to be draggy, redundant, and not worth reading.  I actually gave it away after reading 30 pages.
B000JQU1VS|5.0|We got a Kindle for Christmas. This book was a free download. I never read it. Just want to play and see how it worked before I bought any books.
B004GBIE3Y|4.0|I wouldn't say I would willingly watch it again and again and again. But it was cute and good the first time!
B00AA7O22U|4.0|I saw the first movie and it was OK/good.  This one is a whole lot better.  They are still blowing up stuff and kicking butt, they just did a better job at it.  There are a lot of corny one liners but it is still fun to watch.  Jet Li was was not in it for long but did a good job.
B00407PNY2|4.0|This movie was a first for the director in the USA,  No part of the movie was shot in studio.  The mustang stunts were done by Steve McQueen.  The Mustang had a 351 C engine,  the car was one of 4 built for the movie.
B005FUTC86|5.0|Oldie but favorite. My granddaughters love it too. Nice clean movie for kids. Full of interesting and colorful scenes. Love it!
B0015DROBO|5.0|Very captivating novel. The characters and events are pieced together perfectly to hold your attention from beginning to end. It's books like this that make me want to read again.
141659521X|5.0|I always enjoy Vince Flynn novels and have read every one of them.  My only complaint is I have to wait usually two years for a new one to come out.  This one was no disappointment.  I love series where the same character appears and Mitch Rapp is one of my favorite characters.  The action was a mile a minute with a great, unexpected plot twist about halfway through.  It was interesting that Flynn brought memories of Mitch's dead wife Anna and child to the forefront of this novel and how it fit into the plot development.  Read this novel.  You won't be disappointed and will look forward to the next one like me.
B008469DGY|4.0|This is a good game.  I tried the free version and ended up buying it.  Great Graphics!  Good for a quick diversion while waiting on kids sports practice, oil-change, etc.
B007BVT5N4|5.0|Great book. Very inspiring, I suggest this to any belieber(: very easy read and had some good laughs as well(:
B00A8ECU24|5.0|My daughters and I have so much fin with this game. If you are a fan of My Little Pony you'll love this at any age.
0316069434|4.0|I love Michael Connelly and look forward to his books coming out.  I especially like the Harry Bosch ones, but this one wasn't as good as usual.  It was very realistic, perhaps too much so, going through the meticulous and time-consuming procedure police go through getting leads and making an arrest.  It just seemed a bit slow.  The plot was really interesting as was who the bad guys were and I especially liked Harry's interaction with his daughter who was more in the forefront of this novel.
B003YL4KS0|5.0|This book was an amazing eye opener and I loved every minute of it! Every curly girl should read this
B007W8S2MG|5.0|What a great game. I played Persona 3 Portable PSP but this just blows it away in terms of refinement and improvements. This is the best game on the Vita hands down. I am over 40 hours into the game and have just scratched the surface. The plot is interesting, and the soundtrack is exceptional. Highly recommended from a 33 year old gamer who grew up playing MSX, NES, and SNES.
B001NXDIMK|5.0|As I reviewed before, the first, second and third seasons did not have captions. But, it is a great series.
0312997221|5.0|I bought this book as a Christmas gift.  I read it some time ago and loved it.<br />Hopefully the person that I gave it to will enjoy it also.
B008Y2FRFO|5.0|This is a very fun game and it is a much cheaper way to play this game.I can't believe more people don't play this it is really one that I've played daily
B006O3MU96|5.0|I loved the holiday version of doodle jump! I thought it was cute and creative with a different twist on a game I already enjoy. Fun game!!
B004LWZWGA|5.0|The Batman series has not disappointed me. This movie was a little emotional because of Batman's life experiences. It would be nice to have one more that ends upbeat.
B0013FSL3E|5.0|I really love this movie! I never thought I'd like a movie so much about a little robot! Such a cute movie!
B007TK77QE|4.0|It took me a while to start to get the large cast of characters straight, but this then turned into a very gripping (if sad) tale.  Good to see that she can write good books for adults as well as the hugely successful HP series.
B007RRFUHM|1.0|I would like recommend this cd and I'm a big fan of any type music. For example I like Basia and swing out sister and I thought this was on the style of these two artist and I was totally wrong.
B009MF5BXK|5.0|I liked the first Expendables so much that I ordered Expendables 2. I was not disappointed, in fact, I think it was better than the first. I would love to see a 3rd.
B00992CF6W|5.0|this game is definitely worth the $7.00! you get diamonds and gold and in survival you get creepiest and spiders and zombies!
B000V659OU|2.0|This movie was cloying, sentimental, sappy, banal, trite and boring.  Tim Burton's movies all look alike.  And as an Alabamian, the stereotypes of the south were annoying, and at times offensive.  Avoid this turkey.
B001AKJ97O|5.0|Anyone who listened to Adele in 2008 know the true magic of this album. Some days you just need the solace Adele's voice provides.
B0042AEOG0|5.0|I was not familiar with Mariah Carey. When I heard her sing on TV the &#34;All I Want For Christmas&#34; song, I just had to have it. What a great song to dance and sing to. I may have to order another one next year because I have absolutely worn this one out. It's the first time since I was a little girl that I fell in love with an amazing upbeat Christmas song. Thanks Ms. Mariah.
B0087JTAKW|5.0|can not put it down. Great reading, this is a very good book. I think you will like it. Try it
B005LAIHSQ|4.0|Action, action and more action.  Just an exciting movie with a touch of romance and wow an evil stepmother.  What more can you ask.
B007KOMTUI|5.0|I love that episodes through Amazon are so significantly cheaper than iTunes, and can still be played on my iPad. Only downside is that I had to download each episode (which took quite a while) because it doesn't run on WiFi. I knew I should have bought a Kindle Fire... Oh well, too late now!<br /><br />About the show... We love love love Mad Men! We watched the first four seasons on Netflix and just couldn't wait for Season 5 to become available. Don't want to give away too much about the season, but if you're a fan, you won't be disappointed!
B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|Finally watched this series and hooked. I can't wait to see Season 3. Last few minutes of Season 2 final episode made me bawl.
0375851569|5.0|I used to read these stories to my grand children and my children! This is a classic series. Thank you!
B008AK8FHM|4.0|Fairly well written account of a skeptic's visit to the &#34;other side&#34; ... as a neurologist, I loved the combination of science and the divine ... Sometimes very technical, but that was a credible contribution to his observations.  Certainly worth a read -- and it will make you think and think and think.
B005CRQ4GU|5.0|This book is awesome. I picked this book because I like the other books in the series. It's the best book in the series so far.
B000ICM5VW|3.0|So I bought this item thinking I would be able to view it on my HD Bluray player but that Dod not work. Hence, I can't give it the rating it deserves.
1439152802|1.0|I was disappointed with the book. I felt as if I was reading a soap opera! Would not recommend this to anyone.
B008JGSM6G|5.0|I'm not sure if I love this or hate it but I can't leave it alone!  lots and lots of fun.  Games range from easy to hard.
B00AQ3K8IU|5.0|This is one of the best book's I've read. I went through so many emotions it was unbelievable. I didn't think a book could do that. I laughed and almost cried fighting away tears sometimes even clearing the knots forming in my throat.<br />The characters are great and the things the characters do and say have so much meaning love the ending and the twist at the end.<br />It's one of those book you'll find hard to put down!!
B000O179HW|3.0|I was unable to view it on my HD Blueray disc player. So I could not get to view to give this a good rating.
B006VFLIYK|5.0|Very well written.  Great thriller that kept me interested throughout.  Perfect book to read while snuggled in front of a fire during the winter.
B003JTHXOK|5.0|Truly an incredible story that'll make you want to finish as soon as you can. Officially my favorite book now.
B00632HWOG|5.0|I have had tremendous success with Yahoo mail and it is without doubt for me my favorite.  I am able to navigate through the different aspects within the mail system with tremendous ease and any problems I have encountered have resolved easily and proficiently.
B007MNV5WU|5.0|I love playing this game and still play it to this day. My only issue is that the sound effects could have been a little better.
B005BRS8Z6|5.0|I enjoyed this product. It was direct, easy reading, and contained valuable advice. I would recomend this to anyone looking for a self help book.
B007M45PMU|4.0|Bought it by accident  just wanted one song, but happy I did. Turned out good. Would recommend to anyone  thanks
B005LAJ1H2|5.0|I love it, already waiting for the third season... When does it come to the store? Really great tv serie
B004SJ3BCI|5.0|I love playing this game and still play it to this day. My only issue is that it is getting too difficult to pass.
B004SJ3BCI|5.0|Being able to download this to my tablet instantly was great! I'm now starting to understand why this game is so popular...and addicting!
B007SYWFRM|4.0|I like the game but sometimes it randomly shuts down and other times it'll say I'm not connected to the Internet when I am, but other than that I really enjoy playing it.
B007SGLZP8|4.0|I am only halfway through with this book but it intrigues me. I'm trying to figure out how his proposal to the feds will end. Will he get out of prison? At what cost?
B005HSL626|5.0|I love playing this game and still play it to this day. My only issue is that you have to purchase the full version to getmore excitement.
B006GWO5NE|5.0|We had trouble with the charger that came with our Kindle Fire, and sometimes when it seemed to be plugged in, we would come back to find the battery drained. This one plugs in securely, and works like a charm.
B001DCZ4IW|4.0|This story explores the life of an unappreciative teen and a lady who is thankful for each and every minute of life.  It is a roller coaster ride of emotions and after seeing it I had to own a copy.
0525953728|5.0|Thoroughly enjoyed this book. Read it in two days over the holidays. Good to hear his side of the events.
B006MW3V6U|5.0|So involved in the lives of the characters I had to watch it all at once. Sick with a cold so I had an all day Downton Abbey marathon!
B002SR3T10|5.0|A delightful double album set. I especially enljoyed that the live version, including readings, was included. I recommend this set for any Tull fan.
B00APUYWYA|5.0|Literally everyone I know loved this movie including me. Super cute romantic comedy. Anna Kendrick is fantastic and Rebel Wilson steals the show. Such a fun movie.
B00AA7O22U|5.0|I liked the movie, plenty of action some comedy,good seeing action guys from 80's and 90's. Can't wait for number 3....
B007K4Q8S2|5.0|This book is wonderful, and Elizabeth's personality is displayed in her writing.  She is a joy to read, and her explanations and techniques are great!
B008MG1E4A|5.0|Cover to cover awesome! I could not put down the kindle. An<br />Interesting first hand account of a historic operation.
B0084BMUFA|5.0|This is a great classic and its always good to read at Christmas.  I just never grows old. The ghosts of Christmas past, present and future are still hauntingly interesting and relevant.
B00A6PD9I4|4.0|pretty cool movie, good story action,comedy good for both kids and adults, I would recommend it. will watch again.. funny
B00007GZR0|5.0|I love old Rock Hudson movies, and could not find this in stores.  This particular one is an all time favorite!
B008JFC6F0|5.0|Please refer to the title of this review for an accurate, concise review of the album \\"Lonerism\\" by Tame Impala.
B0058YPL66|5.0|love this show. It's been great to watch season one over again and see all the stuff i missed the first time around.  Can't wait for the rest of season two
B008JGSM6G|4.0|I called this &#34;simple fun&#34; in my title line, but have to admit I've gotten stuck on some games. I don't want to use clues (especially since you have to pay for all but the first few); really, I want to know I figured it out for myself. I can feel my brain learning to think in different ways, when I play it. I like the colorful appearance, and the smooth glide as I play it on my Kindle Fire.
B008JGSM6G|5.0|This looks easy but the more you play and the higher you go the tougher it gets.  Really good to use when on the go, waiting at airports etc.
B004UPANAI|5.0|Hey, I thought the movie was real good.  The kids on the other hand said the sound guality was poor.
B0069G5Z9K|5.0|It is so entertaining and once you start to play you cant stop that's how addictive it is and I would recommend this app to any of my friends and family
B009JBZH54|5.0|This was a perfect holiday gift for my batman loving husband. He absolutely loved it and I loved the price.
B00A0SKFLG|2.0|The movie was one endless chase scene. The settings were beautiful; however, the story was weak.  If Jessica Biel wasn't so damn hot I would have rated it a one-star.
B008XBHIEY|5.0|Good old timer movie for the kids while their getting over the flu bug.  But they wonder, &#34;How was this scary?&#34;  Check it out.
B00992CF6W|3.0|I love mine craft but its too much money at seven dollars and its not worth buying if you want to pay that much money for an app then you can go right ahead but if you do your crazy
B005LAJ17M|5.0|This a great show that is well put together and pulls the viewer right.Viewing it on Blu-ray makes it even better.
B004DSX5B6|1.0|This thing is crap the tips break way to easy and the locking things dont hold good. I have almost stabed myself a few times when the blades fly out by themselves
B004JMY312|5.0|Kids really enjoyed this movie.  One has been trying to see the movie all the way through for a while now.  Thanks for provideing good entertainment.
1451673442|5.0|Read it and you do receive the positive attitude you SHOULD have...Up lifting, wonderful, positive, and worthwhile!<br />My life is changing! and so can Yours!!
B009JBZH54|5.0|Great gift for the movie buff.I gave it to my brother-inlaw and he won't stop watching it.<br />The special features for the Dark knight rises are plentiful.
B00338QENI|5.0|John Hopkins and medical practices of the 50's were questionable yet informative.  The persistence of the reporter detailing the life of the Lack family included caring and friendship.
B008D28HYS|5.0|By far the best nonogram app I have found. It is intuitive and fun. Difficulty levels range from fun for my 5 year old to challenging for myself.
B0070Y46UY|4.0|The story is unbelievable. Any person lost at sea has<br />a tale of sorts. This book was well written and a great read.<br />I would caution young readers, there are gross things<br />that happen, and mind images are harsh.
B001F6TXME|5.0|Now that I've used this on numerous occassions, I wonder how I ever got along with out it, this will improve your shots, no doubt.
B009YP9L7U|4.0|Very easy read. Too much alcohol leads to a man, marriage and blurred lines about relationships. Funny, sweet, romantic with a fairy tale ending.
B000I9U9A4|4.0|Beautiful sailing movie, great action, much better acting than I was anticipating, and the script had more depth as well.  Also historically interesting as a picture (though I am sure it was sanitized) of everyday life on a military sailing vessel.  I was wrapped up in the story from beginning to end.  Highly recommended.
B00AIQP9DE|4.0|i really liked it, but way too short for a paid version.would not have bought if i knew it would end so soon.
B000ZNRBK4|5.0|What can you say about a hood: I works , it works , it works--it fits well and stays snuggly in place
B003XF1XOQ|5.0|The perfect ending for a perfect series. I couldn't be more satisfied. I just wish the other boy (don't want to spoil the ending) was more relevant towards the finale.
B00932AA5G|4.0|Though this movie had pretty good reviews, I was skeptical. One more foreign movie with subtitles that was claiming to be funny. But this turned out to surprisingly good.<br /><br />The plot is engaging and the story is actually funny. Don't want to give out any more details and spoil it for you.<br /><br />I think it is worth your time to watch. As another reviewer says, I hope Hollywood doesn't try to remake this!
B004P12SSW|5.0|This movie gets better everytime i watch it. It would never produce an Oscar, but the director made the very best movie from what he had.<br />Christina and Cher, 6 stars<br />Music and dancing, 7 stars<br />There was no nudity, with the exception of a brief shot of a man's butt.  If only it was Chistina or Julianne's butt, I would have given it 10 stars.  However, leaving nudity out was brilliant.<br />It will be a classic movie someday.
B009MO5960|5.0|Retribution was actually a top notch sci-fi action thriller.<br /><br />All the critics giving it one star are doing so because they didn't like the story or because it's not exactly like the video game. If you can hear me rolling my eyes it's because they are tearing out of their sockets.<br /><br />Here's the thing: if this was the first film of the RE series these same fans would have downright pissed themselves in excitement.<br /><br />This film has some interesting new story elements as well as some recycled ones. There are some new characters and some recycled ones. With nearly a dozen faces, I knew the character development would be minimal. That's fine. The main characters have already been well established, so I took this film at face value--as an action romp with fire fights and kick ass fight sequences.<br /><br />As for the basic plot, it turns out the sinister Red Queen program is back and she has overtaken Umbrella's flagship testing facility and is conducting her own experiments.<br /><br />Alice is captured and brought here, meanwhile there is an ongoing rescue mission to get her out.<br /><br />Admittedly, it's a straight forward and easy to follow plot. The rest is window dressing.<br /><br />The action is nonstop, and even though there is little character development this time around, this film is not a drama building piece but a push to the grand finale of the series. It woks like a shot of adrenalin and doesn't let up till the very end.<br /><br />Now to address some of the critics concerns.<br /><br />Those saying Retribution has too many plot holes obviously haven't watched any of the other Resident Evil movies. At least, not with their eyes open. Those saying it lacks the depth of the games aren't wrong, but whenever has a thirty hour game translated well to an hour and a half feature film?<br /><br />That said this is a gorgeous looking film, especially on Bluray 3D. The choreography and action sequences are par to none, and the CG is surprisingly good. It may not have the finish or polish of a film like Avengers, but Retribution's budget being a fraction of other blockbusters, I think the SFX are more than believable.<br /><br />As far as action sci-fi goes, this film is excellent. If you want more character depth and horror filled zombie moments then I recommend you try AMC's The Walking Dead.<br /><br />If you're an action film buff, enjoy sci-fi, and are a Milla Jovovich fan then this film hits the sweet spot.isingly good.

B007BVT5N4|1.0|Ok listen up people,  Justin Bieber is NOT i repeat NOT an idol. He is NOT NOT NOT a god. THE ONLY GOD THEIR IS IS JESUS CHRIST!!! He saved your sins and loves you. he created the whole world. he created the birds of the air and the creatures among the ground. So, what i am trying to say here is that God, Jesus Christ is the ony God. So, instead of picking up this book, pick up a Bible. oh and if Justin Bieber is reading this maybe it will inspire you. someone said that you &#34;never wanted to be famous&#34; yeah right i find that Real hard to believe. SO ONLY JESUS CHRIST IS THE REAL GOD. SO DONT YOU DARE THINK YOU ARE AN IDOL OR A god. YOUR NOT!!!! i have not read the book and i never will but instead pick up a Bible PLEASE!!!
B009O2XY12|5.0|Bubble Mania is an easy and fun game just to pass the time away. I give my full recommendation for this game.
B008ASLK8A|5.0|Didn't care for the 1st one so didn't have high expectations for this movie, but much to our surprise...we loved it!
B003ZSJ212|5.0|I am sympathetic to all of the negative reviews and the tweaks that could have been made to make this a better set.  But at the end of the day, this is a beautiful, simple collection with enough extras for a fan who doesn't want to make studying the Star Wars universe a full time job.  The price is right. The spoof disk is great.  The packaging is attractive and tidy.
B004XECNCW|5.0|No matter how many times I watch it I'm still enjoying it as the first time, that only happens, to my point of view, to classics.<br /><br />Depicts perfectly the african-amercian society of the 80's 90's just like &#34;Blood In Blood Out&#34; would do for &#34;chicano's&#34; society.
B0064X7FVE|5.0|I love having the convenience of The Weather Channel app where ever I go. I can look up other cities of interest and other important weather information. I am really enjoying this app and highly recommend The Weather Channel.
0446580848|1.0|I loved The Charm School, and decided to read all of Nelson DeMille's books. I have read most and loved everyone, until this one. Lot of wasted space and unnecessary words. But the last 2 chapters left me puzzled. How can you be in the far east and shot at every move, unable to get out of that country and then bam, turn the page and you are in the U.S. makes no sense to me at all, I am sorry I wasted my time on it.
B00992CF6W|5.0|Best game ever for kindle fire. I have minecraft for the pc and it is very lagy. This has no lag. I kind of like this better.
B005ZHBA9I|5.0|So happy that they brought Burwell back for the finale.  I love his music and the score fits perfectly with the movie.
B00A77II0U|5.0|I was very entertained with this game. It wasnt too short and although it didnt have zoom ability, objects were easy enough to find or hints available. played on kfhd, would recommend to anyone that likes ho games with mystery.
B007SGLZP8|5.0|John may even exceed Shelton's expertise in weaving a tale; I immensely enjoy his work and only wish he would write faster. (:-)
B000VK99Z6|5.0|The movie starts off a bit slow, but it is hilarious once the action get's going. It's classic English humor. If you like Shaun of the Dead, you'll love this movie equally.
B003JTHXOK|5.0|I read another review which described this book as transformative and I believe it can be if you let it. I'm not one for love stories and yet calling this book a love story isn't entirely accurate. I read it in one sitting and felt something shift inside me. Maybe it will do the same for you or perhaps it won't. Either way it will be worth your time to read it and it will be something that stays with you long after the final page.
B006LSZECO|4.0|Halfway through, this novel changes from mundane to interesting. I can't say that I love the main characters, but I enjoyed the book overall.  Not the average read and definitely one to be discussed.
B00447L4JG|5.0|I was sixteen years old when The Nightmare Before Christmas was first released in 1994. I knew absolutely nothing of what it was about. I'd see full page magazine ads featuring drawings of Jack, Sally, Lock, Shock, Barrel et al. The ads told me nothing. They merely said \\"Meet Jack\\" or \\"Meet Sally\\". What I did know was that it was a vision of Tim Burton, one of my all time favorite directors, and based on those ads alone, there was no way I was not seeing this film. I couldn't wait. Finally it hit theatres, and I was right there opening weekend. The theatre was sparce, it was not drawing large audiences initially. In fact, upon both of my viewings in the theatre, several people actually got up and walked out in the middle of the film. I could not understand this. For as soon as the film opened I'd tears literally streaming down my face in awe. It was the most original, beautiful, and unique vision I'd ever witnessed. I remember being made fun of because I loved the film with my whole heart, while I listened to others call it \\"stupid\\" and \\"boring\\" and other horrible names. Plot wise, it is really very simple. Our main character, Jack, The Pumpkin King of Halloweentown, has grown so tired of the same routine. He feels something is deeply missing in his life. That his life has in fact become meaningless. Upon a deep walk into the unknown forest to ponder these things Jack stumbles upon the door to Christmas Town and literally falls through it by accident. In Christmas Town, Jack (speaking voice by Chris Sarandon, singing voice by Danny Elman) feels joy and happiness. The absence of ghouls and fear perplexes him. It's a feeling of warmth and love, one he wishes to take back with him to Halloweentown. So Jack devises an elaborate scheme to \\"Kidnap The Sandy Claws\\" and take over Christmas. All the denizens of Halloweentown seem excited and eager to be a part of Jack's plan, including The Mayor (voiced by the late Glenn Shadix), Halloween's finest trick-or-treaters -  Lock(voiced by Paul Reubens), Shock (voiced by Catherine O'Hara), and Barrel (voiced by Danny Elfman), and Dr. Finkelstein (voiced by the late William Hickey). The only character who sees imminent danger in Jack's plan is Sally (voiced by Catherine O'Hara), a rag doll created by Dr. Finkelstein. Sally secretly pines for Jack, who fails to notice the open offering of her heart, and genuinely fears for his safety and well being in a plan she knows to be wrong. In essence, Sally's love for Jack makes up the heart of the story and is the glue which ultimately holds it together. The only real character to be feared is Oogie Boogie (voiced by Ken Page), the Boogeyman of Halloweentown, who happens to employ Lock, Shock, and Barrel. The Nightmare Before Christmas is visually stunning and contains likely the best songs I've ever heard in an animated feature. It is filled with beauty and tragedy and deep underlying life lessons. The film gives deeper meaning to all holidays, the reasons they exist, and the importance of celebration. I've always stood by The Nightmare Before Christmas and it remains one of my absolute favorite films of all time. I would caution the parents of very young children, as the film may be too scary for small eyes. The thing that miffs me personally, not that it is undeserving, is how popular the film became over a decade after its original release. For some reason, the film seemed to generate with new audiences and ultimately has become a cult classic. But for the record, I was there in 1994, on opening weekend, and I knew then that it would be one of the greatest cinematic masterpieces I'd ever have privilege to witness. Though I'm certain The Nightmare Before Christmas is enjoyed by children, I label it as an adult film and always have. I highly recommend this edition, which is filled with special features, including Tim Burton's original short film Frankenweenie (1984).
B009HEJXFS|4.0|J travels back in time to help a younger K and change history back. Expect a surprise ending. Otherwise usual MIB theme with comical lines that will make you laugh as is typical with Will Smith.
B008TRUDAS|5.0|OMG!! Go from laughing to crying to anger then crying to laughing again. Love this book!! Can't wait to read the second one! Already bought it so now I'm headed to read more :) BUY THIS BOOK WON'T REGRET IT!!!!
B003O86FMW|5.0|Read it in 2 days; would have been 1 had my kindle not dies on me!! Awesome doesn't even do it justice!
B003XF1XOQ|5.0|Sorry to see it end!  Great book and look forward to seeing more books from this author.  Great detail and imagination.
B005LAIHQS|4.0|I was leery about this movie, but it turned out to very good with a great ending. That's all I'm going to say because I'm afraid I'll give something away.
B0095VPAVE|5.0|as i mentioned in the headline<br /><br />@compare the processing power to the price ?<br /><br />you can do a lot of things with this CPU withing low cost range<br /><br />i love AMD and amazon 2 .^_^
B004ZRV3AU|1.0|I was disappointed in the quality of this item. This item did not meet my expectations. I ended up exchanging for an Armour Bottle Cutter
B0058VW36U|1.0|I just bought the app but it wont install it. I really wanna play it. and I was charged for it
B004VMUS9G|5.0|Its so much better then the standard alarm clock. It can gradually increase the alarm volume. So much better to wake up to that then right at full blast
B005COO1X6|5.0|Book was great, but like most of King's books it has left me wanting, it ends rather abruptly, but still a great read.
B00881VLCE|5.0|I don't like the puzzles that are just squares you move around. These are actual puzzle pieces and much better than those others. And you can download different themes that have more puzzles (a ton of free ones). I absolutely love this app. My kids have enjoyed it too. Especially because you can choose new puzzles and themes. I think this app was very well made. I use it on my kindle and it works perfectly. I don't like that I have to turn my GPS on to play it, but it is still worth 5 stars.
B002UM5BXW|3.0|Fun read...true words about the great but nontraditional and underground world of the restaurant business. Definitely looking forward to the next.
B008XG1X18|5.0|I find ways to improve my everyday just by paging through photos.<br />Eight more words required? Whatever happened to succinct?
B005CRQ4GU|5.0|Really good and l hope u make a 2 part of the book<br />To tell us if Johnny cheddar is at it again or if some one is messing with him  emma petrowicz
B009YP9L7U|5.0|From beginning to end I loved it! I couldn't put it down! A very romantic book an from the start you can feel the connection between the characters.
B008Y2FRFO|5.0|lots of fun! can't. stop playing, even though you have to wait a little while for your coins to build back up.
B006M4RN3U|5.0|Inspired by the hits on the radio I decided to buy the album.  I was not disappointed.  Track after track excellent sounds.
B007IXWKUK|5.0|I  love the fifty shades series! These are books i would read again and again. I deffinately would reccomend these to any woman who likes love stories with a twist!
B003JTHXOK|5.0|Best book I've read in such a long time. Both a tear jerker and a  heart warmer. Not many books can make you laugh, cry, smile and make you feel so much like the character, but this is one sure can.
B0063M22QO|4.0|Very interesting.  I love mahjong games a lot.  They help me to maintain my concentration and to stay focus on specific things.
B001P9EQH8|4.0|I've used this little guy for some time now; primarily with my Toshiba laptop and a pair of Bose Ae2s. Without an extra amp ae2s really lack in base, but with the help of this guy, it really kicks them up a notch.<br /><br />It seems that the amp was designed only for two settings, but there is also a third one.<br /><br />Placing the switch directly in between the two settings gives an extra volume boost, of cource at the cost of the battery life.<br /><br />Overall, a very convenient little guy, use it with just about any mobile device for more richer sound!<br /><br />Hope it helps!
B0095ZMMCK|4.0|If you like Clancy, you'll like Threat Vector. Hendley Associates (formerly Rainbow) saving America once again, and completely off-the-books. High tech while remaining understandable to those of us in the older generation. Intricate storyline tied together nicely by the end. Jack Ryan junior thoroughly likable, characters from previous installments treated well, bad guys utterly detestable and suitably menacing -- as a matter of fact, bad guys almost omniscient. This will certainly help the special ops guys and geeks keep their share do the federal budget regardless of the economy. Only downsides: totally formulaic, with Clancy giving us his customary beaucoup pages of dastardly detail before FINALLY getting to the resolving action. That is why I personally prefer Frederick Forsyth's tighter and tenser writing style. Each to his own tastes, I suppose. Otherwise, a splendid read, satisfying to spy-thriller aficionados and news junkies alike. Thanks again, Mr. Clancy.
B0070Y46UY|4.0|The end was extremely intriguing and kept you hooked, but barely made up for the tedious beginning. However, it was a different, yet interesting  book overall and I recommend it
B005K15XR4|5.0|This is the first album I've purchased from Two Steps From Hell.  Nearly all of the tracks on this album are great.  It's definitely one of my favorite albums of 2012.
B0085KGHI6|5.0|This is not to be missed as The Stones take the stage with their idol, Muddy Waters.  It's just way too much fun watching the interaction between all these amazing performers.
B009WO7NQO|4.0|I really like this game... But I do think angry birds space is a bit better. Overall good graphics, but annoying sounds. Fun gameplay but not as good as space.
B00005BKZJ|5.0|This, one of my most favorite bittersweetly romantic movies, about starting over in a strange new place with strange new people.  Jack Palance and Marianne Sagebrecht are  amazing actors and the most unexpected pair you can imagine. She, a most enigmatic persona that has some people baffled and disturbed, (also wonderful in \\"War of the Roses\\"). Palance, a retired Hollywood set painter is talented, gentlemanly, and instantly enamored...  C.C. Pounder (remember the detective woman series?) is the harried owner of a Western gas/motel that looks like the last place you'd want to land, if visiting the states from Germany, prepared for a luxury vacation.  Some people are really accomplished at making lemonade from lemons, or coffee in this case... There is no other way this can end than the way it does, and I like that.
B000001GRZ|5.0|Baroque music is good for background but at times can get boring. Not so with this performance by Pierre Fournier. He plays the Suites slowly but with much feeling and freshness.
B004SJ3BCI|4.0|Guess I am &#34;too old&#34; but it is habit forming.  I just can't get to the next levels and get frustrated....probably a good thing!
B007PT3QOQ|4.0|Truly a great game for the genre it is and for being a play on Oregon trail. Easy to level up and play. Great fir kids to learn about the western expansion .
B0095G5AFU|5.0|This app is wonderful. Awesome features and a wonderful user interface.To be expected, the pro version does not have ads, which to me, makes it worth it. Exactly what I was looking for and much nicer without ads.
B009FZFONO|5.0|The season is not yet over, but it has been well worth purchasing - if only for the spectacular thrill it's provided to this point (winter finale).<br /><br />The writing is complex with various simultaneous threads. Whether a character should be cheered or hated is not always clear; this is a necessity to add charm in such an interpersonal script.  The omniscient point of view of we observers will cause us to seeth at the mere humanity of stupid choices or gung-ho Berserker-type charges into sure death, but this is what keeps us watching.  We know that &#34;in real life&#34; we'd be prone to making the same mistakes.  ...I can't tell you how many times I've dropped all of my bullets while reloading my pistol and facing a hoard of fast approaching zombies.<br /><br />Makeup.  Please...  This series thrives upon excellent makeup.  It is unbelievable!<br /><br />Scenic seems appropriate to one without a script.  The environment is very much to be what it should be, according to the action and dialogue.  If this seems vague, it's in effort to avoid &#34;spoilers.&#34;<br /><br />Cinematography is well done.  It may be tempting to become to &#34;artsy&#34; with this genre, but sometimes the audience simply wants clarity of communication.  The real seller, here, is the acting and story; the camera resists the spotlight and allows the show to shine by performing their job to perfection.  A resounding applause for the photographers!  One with more ego could ruin the show.<br /><br />There is so much more that needs to be mentioned, but we'll wrap with the actors.  The story is excellent but without the passionate commitment of the actors, any script could fall flat.  Suffice it to say that at one point of the series, my Facebook news feed was flooded- ...flooded with weeping viewers.  I'm not kidding.  The actors really sold this season, so far.<br /><br />This is a good season, Amazon readers.  I would recommend it to viewers who love drama and have a strong stomach for ...a moderate amount of gore (lest we forget, it is a zombie apocalypse)...a moderate amount of gore (lest we forget, it is a zombie apocalypse).
B004ZNARH4|5.0|He loves this set, although the marbles are a bit of a goofy addition...He loves the complete reworked set. Pink Floyd is one of the alltime favorites!
B008MG1E4A|5.0|All the pre-publish hype totally unfounded.  (Note the day after it was released, all the talk stopped...).  Owen goes throught he training requirements, his path and finally the UBL mission.  He speaks for those on-the-ground...the truth.  Highly recommended.
B00AA0TJO8|5.0|I've played Drawn to Life 1 &amp; 2 as well as Scribblenauts 1 &amp; 2 and totally love the level of interactivity of those games so very much but have been disappointed that there are virtually zero games that offer that same style of interactivity until now! This is such a fun game that allows you to play a part in a story like one may have always wanted to growing up reading their picture books. This is funny and masterfully executed. One need not be an artist to enjoy this success of an entertainment media. Bravo developers I commend you!
B002MQYOFW|4.0|Held me in the world of Panem from the very first chapter. I can't wait to see where this adventure / rebellion leads.
B0053TMP24|5.0|This book the son of Neptune was a very good book it carried addition romance and adventure all into one
B004DLPXAO|5.0|No problems with it on my android tablet at this point.  Able to read the books that I have gotten on the Amazon website.
B004ZWKWQQ|5.0|Excellent product.  My son loved it.  He built it within a day.  It all held together well, and was a generous size for the price.
B009KHDT0C|2.0|Such a great cast and amazing potential, but several brilliant people missed the mark. I don't think they could all settle on what the film wanted to be so it was &#34;kinda&#34; several things, never being successful in one direction.
B003O86FMW|5.0|This book was better than book 1. There were lots of things I didn't see coming. Great way  to keep you in suspense.
B0087GJ8KM|5.0|Dan hit another home run.  This book is full of useful insights for all of us.  As an IT professional and a consultant he provides evidence for much of what I felt was true,  mainly that selling is everyone's responsibility.  Too often I see managers that think customer relations is not important and wonder why sales are down.
B00005N6KG|5.0|I bought a pair over the summer then I had to keep looking for them.  My whole family was using them
B009329ZF2|4.0|Four stars for action, videography and music. Predictable but fun! Transformers are present.  Very much like 2009 Star Trek. I love it when the good guys win, especially the Navy!!!
B007ZYABW6|5.0|My sister and I both read this book when we were teenagers many, many years ago. I have remembered so many details from this book. I gave my sister the book this Christmas and am going to order one for myself. For those who say the story is not true, I say phooey. I hope other individuals had the same experiences getting out of the Soviet Union during those trying times.
B008673ZAQ|2.0|I have read both of Sylvia Day's two novels, in this trilogy.  I guarantee you I won't be buying the third book!  Both of these novels were terrible - the writing, the plot, the tempo, etc.  Just plain boring.  I am so sick of characters being so dysfunctional.  So what they have problems - just get on with life.  The Grey novels were much better written.  I also won't be purchasing any of Sylvia Day's other novels - based on this boring read.
B007SGLZP8|4.0|Kindle book at its best.  Grisham is one of my favorite authors -  Read the book at one sitting so simple on computer kindle site.
B007ZGBZHE|5.0|Preston and Child's books are among the best series of novels to appear in several generations.  Pendergast is, without a doubt, today's Sherlock Holmes.
B00AQ3K8IU|5.0|As an avid reader I know what it's like to care about characters in books. I can tell you that I felt like I knew Sky. T h is book was filled with emotion and I can tell you I felt everything that the author was trying to convey. I cannot recommend this book enough. I loved it. It was fast paced yet you had to slow down to process what you were reading. I will definitely choose more books by Colleen Hoover.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|Best book I've read in a long time. Can't wait to go and buy the next one! ! ! !
B0063IH60K|2.0|great reminder of playing solidarite in the days gone by as a child.Nit used to playing electronic games. enjoy alright already
B00991TCOG|5.0|I highly recommend this album.  It's been a long time since I've heard music that moved me like this.  Pop it in and let your imagination go.
0810989956|5.0|My son got this first and loved it so much my daughter wanted one too! She was super excited to find this under the Christmas tree this year!  Fun book that the kids can interact with and have fun reading.
B008133MDK|5.0|Having watched seasons 1 and 2, the only criticism I have is that each season is but a few episodes.  It's otherwise a brilliant modernization of Sherlock Holmes, which makes for brilliant entertainment.
B007PT3QOQ|5.0|I remember playing Oregon trail as a kid. This has much better graphics of course. I just don't like how quickly energy drains and it takes forever to build back up. I don't want to spend actual cash to play more.
B0046B8GEQ|4.0|Our family rented this just recently and could not get over all the subtle nuances of the movie.  The story line is good and keeps moving so the children stayed interested and there was enough entertainment for the adults.  The minions were very funny and throughout the whole movie there were added twists that showed how entertaining and intigueing they could be.  In all, the more we watched it, the more we enjoyed it.  We were all a little dissapointed when it had to go back to the rental store. We decided to purchase it because we found ourselves looking for clips online and watching them.  This movie may not be for everyone...but if you like this sort of entertainment, you will not be dissapointed.
B0070Y46UY|4.0|This, for me, was an incredibly slow story to start. In fact, the short chapters had me worried I downloaded the wrong thing, but once the story got to the life boat and animals I couldn't put it down! It ended pretty dark and a twist I was not expecting. All in all, for someone who usually reads more fantasy/fiction, I definitely recommend this book for someone looking for a wild story!
B007J4T2G8|5.0|I'm so ready to read the next book to the trilogy, but I will say I'm shocked about the ending to this book!
B008XG1X18|5.0|I just downloaded to my new kindle fire HD. Love this app!! Everything has worked fine for me so far.
B0052RDHTM|5.0|The story gave insights of historical events from the perspective of the characters. I loved Ken Follett's, DANGEROUS FORTUNE  also for the same reason.  I have recommended these books to several of my friends.
B00AQ3K8IU|5.0|So I bought the book and I cried some.. then I laughed.. I yelled at the screen.. I even cried some more. This book was amazing. It wasn't just realistic, it was touching and eye opening. Can't believe I had waited so long to read it.
B0034G4P80|5.0|I was really looking forward to this, I had ordered one before from someone else and it didn't work and was not<br />refunded.  This one was perfect.
B008KW43TE|3.0|A unique sound, I thought the writing could go further, the production was very good. He doesn't sound like anyone else, but that might not be a good thing.
B0076DCT2G|5.0|This was a very good book. Always love DeMille's main characters with their witty comments and funny jokes. Definitely one of the better reads I've had in a while.
B007D2XSW0|5.0|I really was impressed. It had everything you could ask for. It really helped me do a lot of things.
B001ANSSDC|5.0|This is a very interesting story of people coping with mental illness.  I found I kept thinking about the story long after I finished reading it.  The story really sticks with you!  Even if you have seen the wonderful movie, read this.  The movie was a great adaptation but it doesn't replace the book.  The details and the motivations of the characters are so much more than the movie could do justice to.
B00AC8ZJPQ|5.0|I don't normally review things on here but this movie\miniseries was fantastic and a great addition to the Halo portfolio. It was a job well done, top marks.
B00APUQH0W|5.0|Great chemistry with the cast. A  real &#34;feel good&#34; film, even if you're not a baseball fan.  Worth the watch!
B008AK8FHM|4.0|Dr. Alexander deals candidly with an intriguing experience of his week in a coma.<br />I wish he would have made comparisons with the teachings of Christianity, since<br />he is an Episcopelian and the book shows that his family's faith was instrumental<br />in his &#34;return&#34;.  Eben, give us a follow-up to your great book, please.
B0089AD8IO|5.0|The visual quality is great and the story line is very entertaining. This is a truly enjoyable return of Doctor Who.
B0081JPTCQ|5.0|This app will really help me for when I take my grandfather to the doctor and need to create notes, or have an OCR album of his medical records.  Instant checklists for to-do lists.  I do wonder if they plan (or already have & I haven't found it yet) a OCRish ability.  Thank you for creating a useful app.  Now I´m off to create albums for all the doctors.
B000JMKQX0|5.0|I've never been into the zombie scene but a close friend recommended I check this out. I ended up loving it and would recommend it to anyone who is into sci fi (I'm assuming every zombie lover has already read it)
B00AHSMDQY|5.0|Can't complain at all.  I thoroughly enjoyed this film.  Full of action, lots of surprises.  Can't go wrong with it.
B009O2XY12|4.0|This Game is so much like some facebook games but it somewhat better if that makes any since.<br />But still a great bubble game.Make it more interesting to use your finger instead of a mouse.
B005K17RU0|4.0|Used the weather forecast to get home from Pittsburgh over the holidays and made it safe and sound.  Give it a shot.
B004WR125O|2.0|Other reviewers have had problems, I have had none. Works as designed. have had 6+ months so far! Purchased 10 August 2012<br />No connection issues or distance problems, router is one floor below and 2 rooms over!<br />Update: Shortly after review, 10 Jan 2013 or so, item started cutting out, giving message that server was unavail. No disruption from other wireless devices in home. Purchased another recommended device from other customer recommendations, cheaper, came with cradle, etc.  Hooked up, took right off, no modification, has been working flawlessly for three weeks.  You may want to consider other alternatives, this item seems to be hit or miss and for us the longevity wasn't worth the initial price.

B009VB97EY|3.0|If you're interested in a &#34;Girls Gone Wild&#34; eye candy film watch on.  No plot, boring characters, but plenty of hot, ripped, sexy bods.

B008FYZIVY|5.0|We hadn't caught any &#34;Downton Abbey&#34; on TV, but bought this DVD set based on the praise the series had received, and the question everybody was asking after the Christmas Special (included in this set): Is John Bates going to hang? How could I resist a cliffhanger like that?<br /><br />At the beginning of season 1, it's 1912 and the prospect of WWI looms. But the denizens of Downton Abbey have other things to worry about. Such as meeting the stranger who will inherit the home out from under the family when the Earl leaves this Earthly plane. There are also tensions below stairs, as when John Bates joins the staff as the Earl's valet, but cannot perform all extra duties expected of him due to his war wound.<br /><br />Spreading over both seasons is Lady Mary's scandal, which starts off hilarious - for the viewer, not for her.<br /><br />Season 2 starts in 1916. England has been at war for a year and a half. In January, 1916, England began forced conscription. In 1918, the Spanish flu began its course, killing 20 to 50 million people worldwide over the next two years. All of these affect Downton Abbey. But the plot line that takes over at the end involves John Bates and his wife. His odious loathsome wife.<br /><br />This is a review of the combined two-season set, [[ASIN:B008FYZIVY Downton Abbey Seasons 1 & 2 Limited Edition Set - Original UK Version]]. Sometimes Masterpiece Theater-worthy series can be too drawn out, too much of little happening for a half hour at a time. But &#34;Downton Abbey&#34; is not one of those. Though there is plentiful character exploration, and there's a huge cast of characters to explore, the plotting is so excellently choreographed that we never got bored. As far as writing and dialogue, I thought &#34;Downton Abbey&#34; to be average for Masterpiece Theater. But as far as interesting characters and gripping plot-lines, this series is top of the line.<br /><br />Everything you've heard about Dame Maggie Smith's character is true. She has many of the best lines in the show. Totally irksome, annoying and maddening. But often the truthsayer, and she sometimes surprises.<br /><br />This 2-disc set has season 1 on the first disc. The second disc has season 2, the 2011 Christmas Special and the Limited Edition boxed set Special Features.<br /><br />Special Features:<br /><br />1.  Fashion and Uniforms (17 minutes) This consists of film clips interspersed with interview snippets with the cast and crew. Most of the people are talking on set, with actors usually in their costumes. Commentators include Rosalind Ebbutt (costume designer), Alistair Bruce (historical advisor), Anne 'Nosh' Oldham (hair & makeup designer), Rob James-Collier (plays Thomas), Hugh Bonneville (the Earl), Dan Stevens (Matthew Crawley), Susannah Buxton (costume designer), Penelope Wilton (Isobel), Jessica Brown Findlay (Sybil), Laura Carmichael (Edith), Michelle Dockery (Mary) and Zoe Boyle (Lavinia).<br />Season 1 takes place in the post-Edwardian era, and the men wear tuxes and the ladies wear lovely beaded gowns over corsets - think Titanic style.<br />The 2nd season starts in the middle of WWI. Before the war, women in trousers were common only in the fishing industry. This is the beginning of the &#34;panting&#34; of women in all walks of life, though it's unlikely that Lady Violet, Dowager Countess, ever resorted to pants.<br />Though what is said in this special is interesting, it lacks depth, and with such a popular show, it's too bad BBC didn't have the funds to present something more comprehensive.<br />2.  Romance in the Time of War (16 minutes) The format is the same as special #1, and apparently filmed at the same time. Many of the speakers in #1 also appear in this special, and there's new people: Julian Fellowes (writer and creator), Iain Glen (Richard Carlisle), Thomas Howes (William), Sophie McShera (Daisy), Lesley Nichol (Mrs. Patmore), Joanne Froggatt (Anna), Brendan Coyle (John Bates), and Phyllis Logan (Mrs. Hughes).<br />It is hard for us to understand, now, how massive a break with the rules it was for Sybil to marry the chauffeur. The reactions seems overblown to us, but this was earthshaking to a family like the Earl's in that time.<br />Zoe Boyle says that her hair took and hour and a half to set up every day. This is in part because she has an added hairpiece, but, still, it gives me an idea of why the ladies of that set couldn't do without a maid.<br />3.  House to Hospital (13 minutes) Commentators include some also appearing in special features #1 and #2, with the addition of: Donal Woods (production designer), Gareth Neame (executive producer), Jim Carter (plays Mr. Carson), Dame Maggie Smith (Countess Violet) and Elizabeth McGovern (Cora).<br />Most of the great houses of England were converted to some sort of wartime use. In real life, the families usually moved out of their mansions during their war-time incarnations. The producers needed the Earl's family to stay at home, of course, so they figured turning Downton into an officers' convalescence home would be more believable than if it had turned into a full-blown hospital.<br />Though Season Two's war scenes are brief, they are in excellent juxtaposition to the trials and tribulations of the people at home. As Elizabeth McGovern says, &#34;You go from these horrific scenes of wartime in the trenches, with men being blown up. Then you cut back to these rather petty domestic battles that are being fought in the home front with every bit the passion and energy and commitment.&#34;<br />4.

B00AJRQLTI|5.0|I was REALLY happy to see that the music store had put this music on. Everytime I put on the music I can picture the movie in my head. I rated it a 5 star because not all music can I picture a very detailed scence from a movie I have only seen once. And also the music would play all the way through. I would recommend this to anyone who loves musicals or to sing because with this everything is amazing!
B005K17RU0|2.0|I did not care for this app due to the lack of instant update.  Each time I check it the time listed was well behind the current time.

146500632X|5.0|This calendar is a must have for any One Direction fan. Its great photography and layout/design make it a winner. This will be a joy to look at for the next twelve months.
B007EDYN36|4.0|Good book. Also try the Ace Feebly book for another perspective. With both, it tells a lot about Kiss nd their dislike of the other two...G & P.
B004XJRQUQ|4.0|Have not read this book yet, working on it.  Bought it because friends told me it's great, hope to start it soon.
B0083GQ2A0|4.0|I watched this with my fiancee'. She thought it was too sad and didn't like it. However, I thought it was a really good movie. It's not Taken, but it's really good. A few cool action scenes when they are running from the wolves and it's heart pounding when you're watching and wondering if they'll be able to escape and make it back to civilization.
B004ZN9UZO|5.0|Animals remastered offers a great increase in sound quality over the previous cd releases. The packaging also includes some neat artwork similar to other Floyd releases. This is a must for any Floyd fan
