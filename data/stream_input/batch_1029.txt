0756405890|4.0|AN EXCELLENT FIRST NOVEL.  WELL TOLD WITH GREAT CHARACTER DEVELOPMENT.  FUN TO READ.  HOPE THE AUTHOR HAS ENOUGH LEFT IN HIM TO QUICKLY CARRY THE STORY FORWARD.
B00005V3Z4|5.0|I bought the Donnie Darko DVD on Amazon about a month ago, and waited approximately two weeks for it! Not too bad. This DVD cost me about a buck, plus shipping, and only had a few scratches here and there, which didn't tamper with the quality of the movie at all. Since ordering this DVD, which was (i think) my first purchase on amazon, I have bought all of my entertainment on amazon. By entertainment, I mean CDs, Movies, Books, etc. Amazon has everything, and I have saved soo much money already.     P.S.- This movie rocks my world. I would recommend it to anyone and everyone! (but preferably the director's cut!)
B00005JMJ4|4.0|Contemplative movie.  Partly about loneliness and feeling out of place.  We experience, through the actors, the real sense of disorientation from being dropped into a strange place with a different culture whilst jetlagged.<br /><br />Not an action movie, and not for the impatient. This is more character driven and setting-location driven rather than plot driven.<br /><br />This is not one of those movies that is consistently upbeat, \\"feel good\\"; but not a total downer either.  It is entirely believable.<br /><br />Interesting scenes of modern Tokyo nightlife and and a glimpse of just some Tokyo lifestyles.

B0010X8NF0|4.0|I found this worth viewing for the beautiful, colorful visuals of India. It appeals to the armchair traveler in me.  For that, I can forgive the significant weaknesses of this movie.  Also, the acting was excellent.<br /><br />The plot seemed inadequate, as if the screenplay and script were thrown together after running out of time to do it right, and also as if the writers were unclear as to what they wanted to say.  Characters were unusual, but annoying, childish, dysfunctional.
1423113381|1.0|I know Rick Riordan can do better than this since he already has with the Percy Jackson series. I won't compare the two, but I will say that excellent children's books do exist, and this is not even close. Ancient Greek mythology and ancient Egyptian culture are probably the two most popular subjects that exist. Most people find them fascinating. I was very excited when I heard about this book and have been waiting to read it for some time. When I found out more about it I was even more excited. A coming of age story with magical powers thrown in on top of the ancient Egyptian theme-awesome. So what went wrong?<br /><br />First, no character development. There are two narrators, a brother and sister, and they don't really have their own personalities. They go through the motions, complete tasks, and have conversations, but there isn't much there personality wise. Sure, one of them dresses in combat boots, and the other one is a bit bookish, but that's all we get. In other books the characters have clear personalities. Examples: Fablehaven, Harry Potter, or even the Percy Jackson series. Each character is distinguishable and unique. That is not the case here, and the book suffers from it. I really think authors need to know that a long drawn out action sequence is just not good enough.<br /><br />Which brings me to the second problem with this book, the plot. There is a bad guy that wants to destroy the world and the main characters have to stop him. Not too deep, but not much different from the general plot in the other books I mentioned. What makes it a problem in this book? The way plot is developed. The characters go where they are told to start the novel. Then, they run into someone that tells them to go see someone else. They go see that person, who then leads them to another person. Get the idea? In the middle of this there will be some danger in the form of a monster or a dangerous location. A book that consists almost entirely of go here do this, go there do that, fight something, go retrieve something, then go talk to this person, is just not good enough. I've played those video games before, they are boring.<br /><br />My third issue is the bad guys. Why is it that children's books never have deep, intelligent, powerful, bad guys? They are always cardboard muahaha style baddies, and The Red Pyramid is no exception. When the bad guy decides to have a long drawn out conversation in the middle of a fight I cringe. The bad guys are just too cheesy in this book, and it's sad. I guess if the main characters have no depth, then their enemies can't be expected to have any either. The super powerful Egyptian entities are no better. They are all eccentric, and some come off as stupid. I don't appreciate powerful beings acting like five year olds. I don't understand why the author chose to portray them that way, it is certainly not funny to me. I guess having Bast constantly reference Friskies is supposed to be funny, but I personally didn't like it.<br /><br />The last issue that I will mention is progression. I like my characters to mature and progress, but again, if they have no personalities, there isn't much to improve upon. The plot was agonizingly slow as well. I was getting tired of the book by the third of fourth person the characters met, and there was at least twenty more to go at that point. If the interactions with these new characters had any effect on the outcome of the book I may have been more interested. Instead, they simply pointed the characters in the direction of the next task.<br /><br />I can't think of a single thing I enjoyed about this book except maybe the beginning before the danger came into play. I really am sick of books where the characters go through the motions and complete task after task. I've read other books where the entire thing feels like one big chase scene, and this is no different. I won't be continuing with this series, and it's a shame because the author could have done so well with the ancient Egpytian theme. Instead, he chose to trivialize everything in a weak attempt at humor that just didn't work for me.e chose to trivialize everything in a weak attempt at humor that just didn't work for me.
B003LAH7MU|4.0|Yes, I've heard these songs too many times to count but I don't get tired of them. Plus orchestra is just fantastic.
B0037QGS0A|5.0|I saw a trailer of this movie on the internet and it was the kind of movie that I like.  It's a story with mystery and turns out in the end with a twist.  It keeps you guessing and wondering the whole way through.  Liam Neeson knows how to pick out movies.  He's always in movies that are like this.
B0002EXH4A|5.0|It's their weakest of the '80s but that doesn't make it bad. It's very diverse ranging from heavy metal to semi-ballads like Mary Jane and In My Darkest Hour which was dedicated to Cliff Burton. Several songs have various tempos and start out at a down tempo then change to a mid tempo and eventually work their way up to a fast pace. It never got the credit it deserved and personally, I like it a lot better than Rust In Peace. SFSGSW is probably their heaviest and rawest album of the '80s, the under production gives it an even harder edge to it. All 8 songs are great but Liar is my absolute favorite.
0307454541|1.0|I really don't get it.  Maybe I'm just an old square who's fussy about language and plot, but I am astonished that this book is being so widely praised.  I can imagine it making a good movie along the lines of \\"Silence of the Lambs,\\" but as a piece of writing and plotting it is strictly amateur hour.  There are so many simple mistakes that a high-school English teacher would put a red check next to: words used twice within a couple of sentences; characters saying the same thing twice, even three times as if saying them for the first time; details \\"revealed\\" when the same detail was revealed two chapters before.  The list goes on.  And the plot?  Yes, there's a plot, one that could have been given full treatment in a book half or less the length of \\"Girl with the Dragon Tattoo.\\"  As I read the endless exposition, I found myself longing for something to happen in the here and now, for some movement forward -- and longing in vain for chapter after chapter.  I was forced to endure characters who not only had nothing to do with the story but added nothing to the interest factor, and a climax rendered completely unsatisfying because the villain turns out to be someone in whom I have been led to have almost zero interest.  Anyway, I know I'm in the minority and wasting my time with this review, but I had to write something in protest to the notion that this lame, repetitive writing and universe of uninteresting characters (not including the core few around whom a pared-down version could have enjoyably revolved) has become the sort of stuff of which a \\"publishing phenomenon\\" is made today.
B0037AGASG|5.0|I bought this for my 5year old daughter and she loves it.  Shipping was prompt.
B002ZG99A4|5.0|\\"The Expendables\\" is great! This is how the story goes: Barney Ross is a man with nothing to lose. Fearless and void of emotion, he is the leader, the sage and the strategist of this tight-knit band of men who live on the fringe. His only attachment is to his pickup truck, his seaplane and his team of loyal modern-day warriors. His is a true cynic who describes what he does as 'removing those hard to get at stains'. The team behind him is made up of Lee Christmas, former SAS and a savant with anything that has a blade; Ying Yang, a master at close-quarter combat; Hale Caesar, who has known Barney for ten years and is a long-barrel weapons specialist; Toll Road, a skilled demolitions expert and considered the intellect of the group; and Gunner Jensen, a combat veteran and an expert in precision sniping who struggles with his own demons. When the mysterious Church offers Barney a job no one else would take, Barney and his team embark on what appears to be a routine mission: overthrow General Gaza, the murderous dictator of the small island country of Vilena and end the years of death and destruction inflicted on its people. On a reconnaissance mission to Vilena, Barney and Christmas meet their contact Sandra, a local freedom-fighter with a dark secret. They also come to learn who their true enemy is: rogue ex-CIA operative James Munroe and his henchman Paine. When things go terribly wrong, Barney and Christmas are forced to leave Sandra behind, essentially giving her a death sentence. Haunted by this failure, Barney convinces the team to return to Vilena to rescue the hostage and finish the job he started. And to perhaps save a soul: his own.    The cast led by Sylvester Stallone (who also directed and co-wrote the screenplay) (as Barney Ross), Jason Statham (as Lee Christmas), Jet Li (as Ying Yang), Dolph Lundgren (as Gunner Jensen), Eric Roberts (as James Munroe), Randy Couture (as Toll Road), Steve Austin (as Paine), Terry Crews (as Hale Caesar) & Mickey Rourke (asTool) is great! The directing by Stallone (who also starred & directed \\"Rocky II-V\\" (1979-1990, also wrote the story & screenplay), \\"Rocky Balboa\\" (2006, also wrote the story & screenplay), also wrote the story & screenplay to \\"Rocky\\" (1976, also starred), \\"Rambo\\" (2008, also wrote the story & screenplay and starred), also wrote the screenplays to \\"First Blood\\" (1982, also starred), \\"Rambo: First Blood Part II\\" (1985, also starred), \\"Rambo III\\" (1988, also wrote the story & starred) & also wrote the screenplay to \\"Cliffhanger\\" (1993, also starred) is great! The story by Dave Callaham (who also did the story & screenplay to \\"Doom\\" (2005) & the screenplay by Callaham & Stallone is great!    The music by Brian Tyler (who also did the music to \\"Rambo\\", he also did the music, recently, to \\"Fast & Furious\\" (2009), \\"Law Abiding Citizen\\" (2009), \\"The Final Destination\\" (2009) & the upcoming \\"Battle: Los Angeles\\" (2011) & \\"The Fast And The Furious 5\\" (2011) is great! The cinematography to Jeffrey L. Kimball (who also did the cinematography to \\"The Specialist\\" (1994, which also starred Stallone & Roberts), \\"Top Gun\\" (1986), \\"Beverly Hills Cop II\\" (1987), \\"Jacob's Ladder\\" (1990), \\"True Romance\\" (1993), \\"Wild Things\\" (1998), \\"Mission: Impossible II\\" (2000), \\"Windtalkers\\" (2002), \\"Star Trek: Nemesis\\" (2002), \\"Paycheck\\" (2003), \\"Be Cool\\" (2005), \\"Glory Road\\" (2006) & \\"Four Christmases\\" (2008) is great! The film editing by Ken Blackwell (who also did the film editing to \\"Friday The 13th\\" (2009) & Paul Harb is great! The casting by Deborah Aquila & Mary Tricia Wood (both of them did the casting to \\"Valentine's Day\\" (2010), \\"Killers\\" (2010) & the upcoming \\"Red Dawn\\" (2010) is great! The production design by Franco-Giacomo Carbone (who also did the production design to \\"Cabin Fever\\" (2002), \\"Wonderland\\" (2003), \\"Hostel\\" (2005, also did the costume design), \\"Bug\\" (2006, also did the art direction), \\"Rocky Balboa\\" & \\"Rambo\\") is great! The art direction by Daniel Flaksman is great! Theset decoration by Robert Gould (who also did the set decoration to \\"Carrie\\" (1976), \\"Cobra\\" (1986, which also starred Stallone, who also wrote the screenplay), \\"Robocop\\" (1987), \\"Total Recall\\" (1990), \\"Die Hard 2: Die Harder\\" (1990), \\"Cliffhanger\\", \\"Demolition Man\\" (1993, which also starred Stallone), \\"Starship Troopers\\" (1997), \\"U-571\\" (2000), \\"Dr. Dolittle 2\\" (2001), \\"Master And Commander: The Far Side Of The World\\" (2003), \\"Cellular\\" (2004, which also starred Statham), \\"Poseidon\\" (2006), \\"Live Free Or Die Hard\\" (2007) & \\"Angels & Demons\\" (2009) is great! The costume design by Lizz Wolf (who also did the costume design to \\"Rambo\\") is great!    This is a great action film that keeps you on the edge of your seat and thinking at the same time. This is another great hit from Stallone. This is one of the best films of the summer and one of the best action films of the year, so far. This is the best cast that an action movie has ever had, so far.

B000002AZ8|5.0|It was a cold week, Thanksgiving, 1994. No file sharing, no downloading, no Britney Spears, no American Idol. The Spice Girls were not even  out yet.  Kurt Cobain had died seven months earlier. But Seattle music still ruled the world. If you are not old enough to remember the 1980s, having to endure hair bands and Micheal Jackson and digital drumming, a absence of pure rock and roll on the charts, it is hard to conceive how cool grunge felt. It was not the 1960s, but here were guys who acted like you, dressed like you, guys you could hang out with, putting out rock and roll records. You really thought in the 1980s this would never happen again--but here it was. As immediate as that turkey defrosting on the counter, that vital fall '94 air.<br /><br />Even if you owned no flannel, even if you had a great job, a college degree, hung out in sophisticated circles, if you had any love for rock as an art form, grunge brought music as you knew it back into the world. It felt SO good. Like not breathing--then getting air back.<br /><br />Not only that. Pearl Jam had released [[ASIN:B0000028UK Vs.]] only a year before. By the 1990s, a band could wait five years before making an album. But out of no place, Pearl Jam released a one off surprise, a  new album that was out just in time for the Thanksgiving weekend. A holiday gift. What a good old fashioned, rock and roll thing to do.<br /><br />Vitalogy, in fact, has a one off feel, one of those albums a band cuts quick, maybe just off the road, when they have ten or twelve songs burning a hole in their pockets and knock them off in a white hot studio week. After the big production of [[ASIN:B0000027RL Ten]] and the anticipation of Vs., Vitalogy felt fresh as a daisy.<br /><br />\\"Spin The Black Circle\\" was the single, and, if you have not figured, is about playing records; Vitalogy came out on vinyl--rare by '94. Listen to this melodic metal, how fast and easy Pearl Jam play it. They sound as though they found the right chords, the right words, the right stars in place on the right night. \\"Spin The Black Circle,\\" is ripped off faster than you can say \\"rock and roll is back.\\"<br /><br />\\"Tremor Christ\\" has a slow burn. Melodic, careful, but still fresh, live sounding. These two tracks are typical of Vitalogy, which is packed with what feel like unplanned experiments, jams, a band after a hot gig who go into a club after hours and just rip the paint off the walls.  \\"Pry To,\\" is almost as funky and live as those old Al Kooper/Mike Bloomfield jams, and \\"Stupidmop\\" is improvise sound collage.<br /><br />Do you believe this was SIXTEEN years ago. Babies I saw when I went to the mall to get this--that's right, we had to leave the house, kiddies,-are making my Starbucks now. We're in a digital mess, too big for anyone to rule like Pearl Jam did JUST before the world got completely connected for good.<br /><br />I don't know if there will ever be a rock album like this, but it is nice to think back, and remember those two great events,<br /><br />Vitalogy, and Thanksgiving.<br /><br />1994e on the right night. \\"Spin The Black Circle,\\" is ripped off faster than you can say \\"rock and roll is back.\\"  \\"Tremor Christ\\" has a slow burn.

0525951652|5.0|Ken Follett's new novel, \\"Fall of Giants\\", is a big boy. It's so big that it could be used as a door stop for a steel door. But I have a feeling that most people reading this review already know it's a big book and don't expect anything less from Ken Follett.<br /><br />\\"Giants\\" is the first in a trilogy about the 20th century. At least I assume it is, because this book is about the run-up to the \\"Great War\\" (WW1) and the four years of war. Follett, as usual, has many characters from Europe and the United States. Most are fictional but some are real. He has the talent to draw these many fictional characters with a deft brush, nuanced-enough to be distinguishable from each other. That's no mean feat, actually; how many novels have you read whose characters just blend into each other and you're never sure about who's who? To help out, though, Follett puts a \\"character page\\" in the front of the book.<br /><br />I can't decide if the reader has to have fundamental knowledge of WW1 to appreciate this book. Follett is a pretty good amateur historian and he's written an excellent \\"historical novel\\". So, I guess it would appeal to, and help teach, readers of any kind. I thought the same thing about his novels about medieval England.<br /><br />Follett follows the fortunes and fates of roughly 10 main characters. All intersect to a certain extent - thwarted lovers, Welsh miners-from-Russia, and diplomats-trying-to-prevent-war - in Follett's pages. I'm looking forward to Follett's next two books in the trilogy to learn what happens to these people as the 20th century unfolds. He's a good writer, as most anyone reading this book would probably agree.
B003I55BIA|5.0|I generally prefer my YA novels to feature urban fantasy settings but after reading the great reviews of this book, I decided to give it a try. Wow! I simply could not put the book down and ended up pulling an all-nighter in order to finish it. And for a mom who values sleep more than just about anything else, that's saying a lot.<br /><br />It doesn't take a rocket scientist to figure out the basic plot points of this story: bad boy meets good girl, falls in love, chaos ensues, and eventually a happy ending materializes. But the fantastic, multifaceted characters, emotional depth, realistic trials and tribulations keep the reader engaged and invested in the story. The writing is top-notch and Elkeles' ability to effortlessly portray characters from various backgrounds and income brackets is impressive. I also liked her treatment of teen sex and drug use -- it exists but it's not glorified and the characters who engage in it are aware of the possible repercussions.<br /><br />But let's not kid ourselves. By far the biggest draw of this novel is the male lead. Alex is truly every girl (and woman's) idea of the perfect bad boy: sexy, smart, funny, impulsive, kind of bad-ass, with a heart of gold. He's not perfect, by any stretch, but his flaws only make him more endearing.<br /><br />So even if this genre isn't your cup of tea or you prefer your male leads to be tall, dark, and dead....give it a try. I think you will be pleasantly surprised. I know I was.

B002L5GQGY|5.0|I saw this on T.V. and had to have it. What I saw on the tube didn't do this DVD justice. Joe Bonamassa is amazing !!!!!!I can't get enough of his playing guitar.He takes you places that you haven't been in a long time. I love Jeff Beck, Eric Clapton and all of the rest of the greats but it's been years since I was so enthralled by someone's ability to play guitar. It is a gift and Joe has learned how to use that gift better than anyone I have heard in a long time ,if ever ! If you really enjoy excellent music that will make you want to first dance and then will make you want to cry, because of the way he sings the blues,then you need to support Joe by purchasing this DVD. By the way, his voice is oh so, so, so sexy I can't say enough about it. You won't be disappointed .

0316067598|5.0|I've always been fascinated by the US Navy SEALs. Iron-men, doing stuff most people couldn't hack. In this case, fighting against Taliban in Afghanistan- a 4-man SEAL team alone in the mountains... (in Norway we have a force that collaborates with the US Navy SEALs, called MARINE JEGERE \\"Navy Hunters/Rangers\\", great guys, really tough...) Luttrell is honest, and gives a rare and unique insight in what it means to be an elite warrior in war against the Taliban. I was was left with humble awe, after reading about the selfless courage of the SEAL team members in the fighting against a large enemy force... Danny, Murphy and Axe and Marcus are true heroes... The bravery of the villagers who helped Luttrell, are moving. I would recommend this book to everybody who wants to learn more about the SEALs, what our forces are up against in Afghanistan and about human courage under the most most extreme conditions. You just's cant put this book down, I read it in 2 days! Great book!
0385339100|4.0|It is about a scumbag that has been caught at his own game, by sadistic people who are even more twisted than he. Back in the u.s , everyone's reeling. But how did they catch him, the man had a ton of plastic surgery and he fled to south america. And how in hell did he face his own death? The story had my heart stopping almost as much as the firm and the girl who played with fire. Which was a good thing for me , cuz I was starting to lose hope  with grisham after reading the bleachers)<br />And the guy narrating the book on cd had a low ominous voice that set the tone for a dark political thriller. Love hearing about the food in new orleans/ mississippi area and the traelouge of south america was wonderful. The only problem I have is he has this problem with repeating stuff over and over and over. It is insulting to a reader when the author has to remind them every 15 pages of what happened. Ok done griping go read the book.
B002S9O0CK|5.0|While the episode seems to start out with a cheesy feel, it's actually quite entertaining. I love that Paris Hilton guest starred as 'herself' but not really herself. Not a fan of her acting, but she did a respectable job.  Ackles and Jensen did an awesome job, as usual, keeping me laughin'!
B003DEMV1Q|1.0|I guess I should have done more homework when purchasing this item.  The album has been edited from the original version.  I didn't see anything stating that before I purchased and I'm very dissapointed at having wasted my money on a product that I now have to go purchase AGAIN to get the un-edited version.
B002NLU0AY|5.0|Yet again, the writers/directors have exceeded awesomeness. They never disappoint!   I actually pre-ordered season5 but ran out of patience for its arrival and had to see this episode.   Ackles and Padelecki provide yet another brilliant performance--and Mark Pellegrino, whom I must say was a genius choice for this role, does an awesome portrayal as Lucifer.   This is the finest perspective I've seen; something I've always personally believed myself... Sympathy for the Devil shows us Lucifer's heart; yes he has one and it's hard not to feel sorry for him.   Future episodes continue into this storyline and keeps us going back for more. I love this show and cannot get enough! 5 stars, all the way!
B002VZC9CY|5.0|I have listened to Natalie Merchant since she was lead vocal with 10,000 Maniacs.  I loved her then and loved when she went solo.  \\"Leave Your Sleep\\" takes her music to the next higher level of artistry.<br /><br />As others have said, these are not children's pieces of music per se, although children will enjoy some of the selections, such as the whimsical \\"Bleezer's Ice Cream\\" and \\"Griselda\\". This was a five-year labor of love for Merchant, I believe so that she could leave it as a lasting treasure for her own daughter.<br /><br />These songs are poems set to music by Merchant.  She meticulously researched each piece of poetry and each poet, wrote wonderful historical notes about each piece and then set them to the music she believed they should be set to.  The CD notes are bound in a gorgeous little book and the whole CD presentation is exceptionally high quality including the paper that was used and the photographs selected.  I buy MP3 downloads for almost all of my music now but in this case I actually bought the CD set (after listening to it from the library).  It is truly a collector's item.<br /><br />The songs/music are varied, some haunting such as \\"If No One Ever Marries Me\\" to toe tapping \\"The Janitor's Boy\\".  I loved every song on both CD's and I can't remember the last time I was able to say that.

The great thing is, they managed to sprinkle in the dramatism of the situation and bring a good amount of personal angst from Sam and Dean.   Be careful whilest taking a sip of your drink, while watching this one. At any moment in time, you'll end up doing a spit-take! Don't skip this one!!

At least providers do the actual work of seeing patients, but let me assure you that there are many people, and not as many docs as you would think, pulling millions of dollars out of the medical insurance pot. So it is also in the pharmaceutical business. These are the \\"suits\\" or the business types who really don't provide much of anything, but have, smelling money as their guide, rooted their way to the money trough and into the control tower. Believe me, the last thing they care about is \\"quality health care.\\" They care about making lots of money. They leave the \\"quality\\" to overly-worked health care providers as they shove the lever from \\"fast\\" to \\"faster\\" with one hand while in the other hand they hold a computer print-out stating production times and profit. \\"If we could only get rid of a few providers and make the others work harder.....\\" or, if we could only reduce the time providers spend with people we could up the numbers of patients seen per day.\\"<br /><br />Moore got it right, but he didn't turn over the last rock.
B002PLAZZM|5.0|Amazing concept! I love how the writers kept us guessing throughout this episode. Excellent all around action and definitely worth watching.
B0036EH3XE|1.0|The writers contradicted every promise they made early on, and somehow despite breaking their own rules, still managed to make the ending as bland as possible. As the the fans guessed from the beginning, the show became too complicated to write a competent ending, so it conveniently turned out that they were all in purgatory. The interesting and mysterious plot that had been building up for several seasons between Ben and Widmore was abandoned for a last-minute, underwhelming battle between two less interesting characters, Jacob and the so-called \\"Man in Black.\\" These two characters should have remained mysterious and minor.<br /><br />The heightened suspense and creative magic that Brian K. Vaughan brought to the show in Season 4 really made for a disappointing contrast when compared against the final season. Nevertheless Lost was an imaginative show that is worth experiencing. Sure, it is slow in places and there are characters who are extraordinarily tiresome, but the overall concept, exciting mysteries, beautiful locations, and a handful of strong performances (Michael Emerson) make it worthwhile.

From the beginning, I had to laugh at this 17 year old kid who swaps lives with Sam.

B002QEJW1Q|5.0|Dean says some things to Sam that would've made me cry if I were Sam... And it's slightly surprising that he doesn't, seeing as he's usually pretty prone to tears.  This episode touches a lot of bases, but I think of all angsty moments, Castiel has taken the brunt.  I definitely recommend this episode--it's imperitive to the series. But then again, most of them ARE--most of them have a little 2 minute-or-so scene, regardless of how off-base the episode as a whole might seem, that has a vital bit of information you NEED TO KNOW.   And I love that about this series...
0307454541|5.0|This review is from: The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo (Millennium Trilogy) (Paperback)<br />After reading so many positive reviews about this book and being attracted to it because it was written by a Swedish author, I decided to see for myself if it was all it was hyped up to be. It was. By the end of the second chapter I was hooked and read through the book in just a couple of days. I read this book on my Kindle and immediately downloaded Stieg Larsson's second book, The Girl Who Played with Fire (Vintage). The book had all the features that I like in a novel, good character development, twists and turns in the plot, and a character who is a computer hacker. (What can I say, I like characters who can get information through devious means.) Lisbeth Salander, the hacker, was my favorite character in the book because she was such a different and fascinating person who we only find out bits and pieces about at a time.<br /><br />After reading this book, I just had to see the movie. It was nice to see what the producers thought the characters would look like but there were so many details of the book that were missing that it was kind of disappointing. The one thing I did like about the movie was that it showed the country and scenes where the story was to have taken place. It's nice, while reading the second book, to have an idea of what the characters could look like.<br /><br />There is a huge cast of characters and at times it was difficult to keep them all straight. I found myself referring back to the family tree that was included at the beginning. The book also mentioned a lot of cities and towns that were unfamiliar to me and it was a little difficult to keep track of them all because they were Swedish names. Looking some of them up on Google Earth helped to put them in context. One word of warning: the story is violent in many parts and people who find graphic details of that type of thing objectionable or upsetting would probably not find this book easy to read.<br /><br />The writing was excellent and I was sorry to learn that Stieg Larsson died soon after signing a contract for this book and his two others. The world lost an amazing author.d.<br /><br />The writing was excellent and I was sorry to learn that Stieg Larsson died soon after signing a contract for this book and his two others.

B003M5AXN4|5.0|Great movie to watch and awesome way to demo 1080P to your friends.  Fast changing images and colors, lots of depth and nice plot done in the Wachowski Brother's style!  Imagination, suspense, action, funny, and intense.  A+++++++++++++++++++++
B001DJ7PR8|4.0|When you are young and on the loose in a foreign country, opportunities arise to explore your sexuality, your values, your morality. Vicky and her friend Cristina do that in this comedy with a couple of dramatic moments. Now that Cruz and Bardem are married, we may see more of their considerable emoting skills together or they may choose to keep their private and professional lives separate. If the latter is the case, you don't want to miss this excellent example of their skill working together. I have no respect for Woody Allen, therefore the 4 Star rating. If I had based the rating on the skill of the actors (all of them, especially Johansson), this film would have been rated a 5. Enjoy
B001OQCV2E|1.0|Yo yo yo!!! It is MC book review again, but now I am here to review a movie.  I WOULD RATHER EAT A BIG BAG OF HAIR THAN WATCH THIS MOVIE AGAIN!!!
B00008972S|5.0|I've just watched \\"West Side Story,\\" first released in 1961. Shooting on this film began almost exactly fifty years ago (at the time of this writing) in NYC on 10 August 1960, so it seemed fitting to view it near that anniversary date. My nephew had expressed interest in seeing the picture, since he had learned one of the songs in music class. And it's been many, many years since I last viewed it, so I thought it a good choice for this weekend.<br /><br />I have to say, I had forgotten just how very good this film is. With a fantastic score and great orchestrations, wonderful choreography, and a story with real emotional pull; all the elements are in place. Now, the bits of the plot that deal with the finer aspects of gang warfare do seem rather quaintly old-fashioned, considering the level of violence that exists in the inner cities today. But then, I don't know that the film was meant to be particularly realistic even when it was shot; it was always a stylised version of reality, rather than a matter-of-fact slice of life.<br /><br />The performances are uniformly good, with Rita Moreno a stand-out. Much could be said about the casting of Natalie Wood, a white girl in a Hispanic role---today it would almost certainly be cast with an actress of the correct ethnicity. However, I think she does do a fine job in the part.<br /><br />Sadly enough, this film seems every bit as topical today---an entire half-century later--- as it did when it was shot. Currently the issues of immigration and racism are hot-button topics in American politics, and are surely going to figure heavily in the upcoming elections.<br /><br />I have the two-DVD \\"special edition\\" of the film, and that is definitely the version to get, until such a time as a Blu-ray is released. The special edition set gives you the widescreen print of the film with a 5.1 surround audio mix, a booklet containing the script and additional information, plus an additional disc containing bonus features.<br /><br />Most interesting of the bonus material is an hour-long documentary detailing the making of the film. The documentary contains a lot of footage shot behind-the-scenes, as well as some footage where you can hear Natalie Wood's own vocals for the musical numbers. Natalie actually recorded all of her own songs, and the film was shot to this playback. But in the end it was decided that her vocals weren't quite strong enough, and Marni Nixon was brought in to dub her singing voice. Marni really was the go-to-gal for musical dubbing for a ten-year period or so: from the mid fifties to the mid sixties she dubbed a number of very famous musicals (including \\"My Fair Lady\\" and \\"The King and I\\"). I have to say, Marni does a great job here; her voice is a good fit for Natalie's speaking voice. But what a difficult job that must have been! Not only did she have to deliver a good vocal performance, she had to exactly match the sync on film that was already shot.<br /><br />So, a definite recommendation from me. This is one of those films that is so much a part of pop culture, and the history of the American theatre, that I think everyone should give it a try at least once. As for how it plays to a modern 12-year-old, well... My nephew Joshua did find it rather long, but did stick it out to the end.<br /><br />Bit of trivia:  The opening of this film was notable at the time for the way it began with long aerial shots of the city, with the camera gradually moving closer and closer to street level as the sounds of city life slowly became audible, before finally focusing in on individual characters at ground level. The film was directed by Robert Wise, who later directed \\"The Sound of Music,\\" and he was very resistant to the idea of using the same technique for the opening of \\"Music;\\" fortunately he eventually changed his mind. It's interesting that, all these years later, it is actually the opening of \\"The Sound of Music\\" that is better remembered and more famous than that of \\"West SideStory.\\"

This is definitely one of those books you can't put down, and are sad to see end...I finished the book yesterday, and part of me is in denial that it's over, looking forward to reading more about Lin's life later this afternoon. I hope this is not the last we hear from Mr. Roberts...
B002ZG99A4|3.0|Don't let my three star review fool you, The Expendables is a fun acton movie and I would give it another half star if I could, but it didn't quite deliver as much as it could have. I don't know why, but to simply put it, some of the toughness felt forced. You have all this top calibur celluloid muscle in need of better material. I know the story and dialogue are suppose to be cheesy and cliche, but Sylvester Stallone couldn't even write anything memorable for the much talked about cameos of Arnold Schwarzenegger and Bruce Willis. I have to admit that the line Stallone says to Arnold as he's leaving is great and easily the best of the movie. Believe it or not, I think a longer version would make it better. There are too many main characters that we learn little to nothing about. I hope we get an extended DVD release in the future.<br /><br />The cast is all about tearing people to shreds using various tools of death and as far as this genre goes, we have the best of the best on display. Stallone is solid, but Jason Statham is the standout. I also liked Mickey Rourke, who is easily the most natural actor of the bunch. Jet Li had a couple of good lines and fight scenes, while Terry Crews uses the most devasting handheld gun on film since the minigun wielded by Jesse Ventura in Predator and Arnold in Terminator 2. I do have to give credit to Dolph Lundgren, who I thought would be horrible, for turning in the scariest performance in the movie.<br /><br />If I were to pick my favorite pure action movies of the summer, I would have to go with Predators first, closely followed by The Expendables. Overall, it's a good throwback to the 80's, with plenty of gore, violence, and a body count way too extreme to ever try and calculate.<br /><br />3 and 1/2 out of 5 stars
B0002Z0EYK|1.0|Please someone should've read the Iliad to Wolfgang Peterson. What I saw instead was beware of Greeks bearing laxatives.  Since there are already 95 one stars reviews already I'll leave it at that. By the way I have read the Iliad and the cast would have been perfectly suited for an accurate rendition of that poem. Too bad!
193413712X|3.0|There is just too much nothing here.  I found the opening so compelling-- George on his deathbed, looking around at the concrete manifestation of the life he has built and contemplating leaving it all behind.  It was so immediate, such awkward, raw, human regret at the inevitable physical leave-taking... such a thing to contemplate, and so plainly presented that I could feel myself step into it, then step out and look around my own life with fresh eyes.  But it has been pretty much downhill from there, no further moments of transcendence IMO.  I'm not done yet, so perhaps there's something coming that makes the slog through Howard's memories worthwhile.  On the positive side, there are moments of very beautiful descriptive language.
B000WGWQG8|5.0|I thoroughly enjoyed the presentation.  It was historically accurate, magnificently produced with costumes, settings,etc.  The portrayal of the historic persons was quite accurate and their language seemed to be true to the spoken word of that day.  Great miniseries!
0061537969|5.0|I had not heard anything about this book before I purchased it.  I am a huge dog lover, so the concept of being told from the dog's point of view intrigued me. It had me hooked from the very first chapter.  It was the type of book that you want to read as fast as you can because it is so very good and you want to know what happens next.  But at the same time you want to read it slowly to savory and immerse yourself in every single scene. It would make me laugh and it would make cry, sometimes at the same time. It was a book that I could not put down. Once I started it, I had to finish it. Nothing got in my way. I believe I ran the whole gammet of emotions reading this book. That being said, I truly believe the last chapter was the most uplifting ending to a book that I had ever read. I highly recommend this book to any dog lover, especially those who have lost their furry best friends.
030745455X|5.0|I am not such a big fan of the thriller genre but this author managed to totally captivate me with the twists and turns involved in  his Millennium trilogy.  I have now finished the 2nd book - TGWPWF - and because of my experience with sequels I am half expecting that the thrills and spills of this book cannot be possibly equalled in the 3rd book.  Irrespective the world has lost a master storyteller when Larsson passed on so unexpectedly.  The UK movie of the first book casting Daniel Craig as the probing journalist, Mikhail is spot on - I reckon Natalie Portman could make a good Salander .... bring on the movies!
0060591714|5.0|This book has an amazing story line. At first it may be a little confusing but eventually, everything comes together. Wonderful!
B000R7I3LY|5.0|Honestly, I'm not sure why I ordered this CD. I heard Love Song on the radio, and wanted it. I don't really like not having a hard copy of my music, so I guess that's why I opted for this whole album. Let me tell you, I'm glad I did.    It took a couple listens, but she quickly grew on me. I now don't often listen to the song which drew me in, and her slower songs are much more powerful. I specifically listen to Between the Lines, City, and Gravity most often. She really has a great voice. You won't find too much clever writing here, but it's still a great album with a good sound.    I'd recommend listening to some of her songs from this album. If you like what you hear, then buy it.
0307474712|2.0|[This review is of the Audible version, narrated by Anna Bentinck. Ms. Bentinck's reading of this work is wonderful. By very slight nuances of voice or pacing, she effectively inhabits the various characters, keeping even long scenes of dialog completely clear as to who was speaking and what they might have been feeling. The narrator's voice also was distinct from the characters', and this all seemed quite effortless and un-\\"acted\\". Kudos.]    This book is lovely in its writing, with many passages of narrative, and especially dialogue, to savor. The language envelops the reader deeply into the story without calling attention to itself, and it was because of the writing that I was pulled to continue with the story, waiting for a payoff that, unfortunately, never came (or rather, came too late to undo the ennui that had set in early and remained for the duration of this dreary book). The organization and structure of the book is, as many others have pointed out, interesting and unusual - checking in on Em and Dex on St. Swithin's Day each year following their initial night together.     However, the story itself is dismal, the characters depressing, the scenes often just excruciating and cringe-making (Dex's scene with his dying mother, e.g.), with the narrative arc sputtering along in stop-and-start fashion along a flat and uninteresting plane, year after year after year. Character development is almost nil. Emma does eventually grow and change, making a life for herself as a waitress, then a teacher, and finally a writer. But Dex simply continues his alcoholic womanizing, riding an endless wave of self-delusion and whining for years until he finally marries Emma, at which time he finally grows up. (Why? How? There was no foreshadowing of growing up for this character.) But only temporarily! As soon as Emma is gone, down goes Dex again, back into his bottle, back under his rock. This time it's because he's grieving. Well, ok.    Fundamental unanswered questions: whydoes Emma even like a poseur like Dex, much less love him, for years on end? Why is Dex, with all his advantages, such an alcoholic, womanizing, self-pitying, boring loser, and why should we care about him? Why does Dex love Emma, who is nice enough and eventually grows out of her own self-righteousness  to become sufficiently accomplished, but is generally dull and not very interesting?     Finally, the payoff limps in, a day late and a dollar short, in the genuinely lovely last scene of the book, which flashes back to continue the story of Em and Dex on their first day following their first night. (This is the first we hear of their having spent the following day together.) Nichols takes time with this scene; finally we see both in a much more sympathetic and endearing light and at long last, we find ourselves wishing them well. Finally we understand why they loved each other all these years. But please: it was their first day after their first night -- why not give it to us right up front, to underwrite the otherwise inexplicable emotion that bound these two together? Why this coy, counterintuitive, backwards structure? We see these characters for hundreds (seems like thousands) of pages mostly at their worst before we finally get to see them as they were when they initially fell in love. A dozen times I wanted to abandon the story on the grounds of boredom and irritation but was kept engaged by the beautiful writing. Why waste such great writing on such a dreary story?     At the end of the day, it's like one of those made-for-tv movies that are just engaging enough to keep you from changing the channel, but when it's over you smack yourself upside the head for having wasted your time and good will.

1400032717|5.0|Although I thought this book was absolutely fantastic, I'm not recommending for those who are not extremely fond of math and logic, like myself.   The main character is essentially a younger  version of Dustin Hoffman's \\"Rainman\\", and all throughout the book he narrates his tale of murder mystery in continuous long and rambling sentences.  Because of his autism, he must mentally note everything he sees and hears in order to comprehend the meaning of events and circumstances around him.  For him, it's putting everything into mathematical terms and it was something, as math and logic junkie, I was really in to.  I truly think the book would give most people a headache, but I was able to find a rhythm in how I read the book that had me completely entranced.from beginning to end  This being the author's debut novel, makes me wonder what other gems he has yet to put pen to paper and share with the world.  Although some reviewers have criticized him for his portrayal of autistic individuals, I felt he did so in a compassionate, sometimes harmlessly amusing way that evoked empathy for all characters involved in the story. There is a heartwarming and innocent aura to the story that is compelling and entertaining to read.
B0034JKZ86|3.0|My nieces made me watch this one by manacling me to the chair.  Just kidding. ;)  Heh. There's some good lines that actually made me laugh a couple of times and the music is fairly good to good if you like musicals.  The villain didn't seem to properly overlap with the heroes though so at times it felt like there were two stories taking place.  Themes of romantic love are rampant.  MY GRADE: B minus (B if you love musicals).

0061373877|5.0|My second Gaiman book on CD - Neverwhere is a very entertaining listen.  My first introduction to Gaiman's work was the movie \\"Stardust\\" based on his book of the same name.  I thoroughly  enjoyed the movie - but then I am a fantasy fan from way back.  My oldest son gave me Gaiman's \\"Anansi Boys\\" in CD for my birthday - I almost didn't listen to it because I read the back description and it sounded a little too \\"fantastic\\" for me - but thankfully I decided to give it a try - and I was not disappointed!  The character development was amazing and the story was very enjoyable.    Neverwhere - read by the author, was just as good!  The character development is again amazing and the story line is very entertaining.  Based on these three works - I am a real Gaiman fan and will be seeking to read, listen, or watch his other available works.    It helps if you have some history of enjoying fantasy works - but if not the character development alone is enough to carry your interest. Read or listen to Neverwhere - you will not be sorry!

B00139XSBA|1.0|Shame on the publisher (Picador/Farrar, Straus and Giroux) for the sloppy production of this ebook. [[ASIN:B00139XSBA The Right Stuff]] To care so little about the quality of their product is an insult to both the author and his readers.  Don't buy the ebook version until the publisher makes it right.<br />The original book, as written by Tom Wolfe, deserves 5 stars.  It's highly entertaining as well as informative.  In this review, I'm only rating the quality of the ebook which has at least five dozen scanning errors, some of which are confusing and make it impossible to figure out what the author intended.  Until the publisher fixes it, spend your money on something else.  There's plenty of quality ebooks available.
0312539525|4.0|I found this piece of \\"historical fiction\\" to very enjoyable and entertaining.  It was hard to put down and I read it fairly quickly.  Archer is a smooth writer who avoids cumbersome prose and knows how to keep the reader's attention.  He mostly sticks to the facts, although there are some liberties and abridgments of history but nothing egregious.  I feel he does George Mallory justice and paints an interesting, yet brief, picture of the early Everest expeditions.  I highly recommend this book as a quick read.  I also recommend Archer's \\"First Among Equals\\" if you enjoy politics.  I may have to pick up some of his other novels since the first two I've read have been enjoyable.

I think it shows an outsider possibly what it is like not only for Bangladeshi immigrant women living in London, but also for the women in Bagladesh.<br /><br />It really makes you appreciate your own life and situation too.  I can't belive this is her first book!  For all of those harsh critics out there; can you do better?  If so, do it!

068817776X|4.0|A co-worker loaned this book to me, thinking I would like to read it. Notice that I didn't say \\"enjoy\\" reading it, because it most certainly isn't the type of book that one enjoys reading. But to say that I was left untouched by it would be a lie. The story of Edith Hahn Beer's life is unbelievable, intriguing, and startling all at the same time.    Edith's saga begins as a Jewish schoolgirl before World War ll, with a childhood in Vienna in an extended family. By 1938, the Nazi influence in Vienna had wrecked havoc on the Jewish people. Edith had been attending the University of Vienna and was one test away from graduating with her law degree, her goal was to be a judge. She was turned away from taking her final exam, told she was no longer welcomed because of her heritage, her bloodline. It wasn't long before Edith was sent to Osterburg to work as a slave laborer on a farm. The time spent here was extremely hard on Edith, yet she met people and learned things that would help her survive in the years yet to come. Upon her return to Vienna, nothing was as it was when she left, her family was gone and there were few friends to help. Yet with the help of a special Christian Aryan friend, Christina Margarethe Denner, Edith was able to secure her identity and leave Vienna as a German.     Thus began Edith's new life as \\"Grete\\", the woman who eventually met and married a Nazi Party Member, Werner Vetter, who became a Nazi officer, and was eventually taken prisoner and served time in Siberia. It was only by forcing herself to forget her family, her heritage, her schooling, and concentrate on being a naive, unschooled, shy \\"German\\" that \\"Grete\\" was able to survive and pass unnoticed amongst her neighbors. Edith had confessed to Werner her true identity but he did not betray her.     I have read other publications and watched shows about the Holocaust, all of which have left me shaken with disbelief, anger, tears - so many emotions. Edith Hahn Beer's saga gave me a new perspective to view the Holocaust from and to wonder if I would have the courage, the tenacity to do what Edith did if placed in a similar position. This is a book that should be read because while it is disturbing, it is also triumphant, and it dares us to remember what happened during those dark years.

He does have one friend that sticks by his side through the good and the bad. This friend is his dog named skip. Its a very good family movie however, the ending is a tear jerker. I have Jack russel so this movie was very touching for me. The bottom line is its a great story. You will laugh and maybe shed some tears. Now go and play with your dog and love him/her.
B003JJA59K|5.0|This movie is certainly done to perfection, but given the nature of the plot, there's no way to make this movie heart-warming or loved. It's bleak and depressing as hell. Like at the end of the book, however, you're given a glimmer of hope so you don't walk away completely dejected.  Viggo Mortensen is fast becoming one of my favorite actors. He doesn't have Johnny Depp looks or an air about him, but he is a superb actor. In this role and every other I've seen him in.  The movie is graphic, gray, and at times terrifying...but the acting, sceenplay, and effects were all still phenomenal. I would watch this movie if you want food for thought and deep-set emotional drama, not if you want something happy and fulfilling.
6305546789|5.0|I Remember I Was 14. And Remembered Seeing The Commercials For It All Week Long, Before The Viewing Expereince That Would FOREVER Change My Take On The Modern Horror Film. When The Movie Finally Began-I Remember The Moustapha Akkad Presents Logo Spilling Across The Screen With The Accompany Of Carpenters Chilling Piano Short Circuiting My Brain. I Just Could Have Never Imagined What I Was Truly In Store For. Now Rounding Out The Fine Age Of 42 My Love For Halloween Has Never Changed.

B0011KQSZ4|5.0|British satire at it's best, Death At A Funeral is a dark comedy full of painful humor. There's not a person in the world who could watch this and not laugh at it.    There really are no words for this brilliant film. Just go watch it. Now. Seriously.
B00009RAJJ|5.0|I've Only Had This CD For 3 Days And I've Gotta Admit There's Alot Of Great Magic Captured Here. Highlights for me- Over & Over, Think About Me, Sara (Yes Folks, It's The Long Version Here.), Sisters Of The Moon, Beautiful Child, And Of Course, Tusk. This Recording In My Opinion Is Perfect Audio-Wise. The Highs are High, And The Lows are Low. Like I Said I've Only Had It for 3 days at this time and although alot of these tracks are a little strange, The Keepers MORE than make up for it. Dive Into Tusk And Explore the magic of an incredible experimental audio wonder....
0061743526|5.0|The book is fine, the service of shipping did not make me happy.  I needed the book for a 5oth birthday.  I was told it would be here by July 22.  It did not, so with further communication I was told since I did super saving shipping that it may take longer.  Why was I told before that I would receive it by July 22?  I had to purchase the book locally for the party.  I returned the book and of course charged shipping for the return.      I have shopped with Amazon before and was pleased.  I will continue to use Amazon, but hope this type of incident will not occur again.    The same situation with the Game of Life, I also had to purchase locally. I returned the game.    Mostly happy customer, not this situation.    Terri Postlethwait
B002VPE1OS|4.0|Very thick screen protector that also offers some anti-glare assistance. Very comparable to name brand offerings from the local stores. But the price is certainly right. You get 3 protectors. They are made well and protect well. They do add a very faint tint to the screen. I suppose this is due to the anti-glare feature. The anti-glare works well in most cases, but I have found that it does not suit well for direct light exposure. It actually made things worse than some of the standard protectors in some direct light conditions. Compared to some standard protectors I've used, it spread the light throughout the screen rather than spotlight areas. Directions are thorough enough. It can take a few times to get it placed correctly, but there are plenty of tricks online to help with that.
044024238X|4.0|This is a fun read, it seemed to start off a little slow for me but once I got to the middle I was eager to see what happens next.  It is cute book and easy read; nice break from reality.
B0036EH3WK|5.0|I've had my favorite tv shows and just never thought another series could live up to my expectations like those from the past but LOST is such an epic series. This complete set is what I've been waiting for and can't wait to see Hurley and Ben as #1 and #2. Hopefully the fake LOST fans complaining about the last season will get a brain. Long live TRUE LOST FANS that love it all.
0061537969|3.0|This is not a book I would have picked up on my own, but I read it for my book club.  I went in with very low expectations, and was pleasantly surprised that I enjoyed it, and totally loved the ending, even though it was pretty silly.  I don't think it was a great book, there were too many things going on at once.  You can have a book told from the point of view of a dog (I would have liked much more of that, what it's like to be a dog, and what the dog thinks about human behavior, and less strange rumination by the dog about reincarnation and movies).  You can have a book about auto racing (although I wouldn't be writing this review, because I would never have read it.)  You can have a book about a man whose wife dies and he battles for custody of their child with her wealthy, horrible parents (although that on it's own would be pretty depressing).  And you could probably combine any TWO of these ideas and have more than enough material to really focus on in more depth.  But why combine all three?  It just didn't completely work for me, but it was a good effort.
B0017HMF6W|5.0|Cary Grant and Alfred Hitchcock's masterpiece  collaboration is well preserved and beautifully remastered in this Blu-ray release.  Highly recommend for your BD library.  The story is pure Hitchcock formula: mistaken identity, being chased by spys and police, and of   course a blond heroine.  Especially enjoy James Mason's cool, evil under-toned role.
B003PIUBZS|5.0|Amazing.  The acting, special effects and especially the creative way the director tells the story of Spartacus has us all hooked.  Much love and good wishes to Andy and his family.  Five stars!
B0025KVLV0|5.0|This isn't the first remastered album by the Beatles that I've purchased, and I know it won't be the last. The sound quality is, in a word, stunning. For those of you who may wondering just how good it is, you won't stop with just one selection.
B001KVZ6FW|3.0|I am a fan of animation, and I think THE INCREDIBLES and MONSTERS,INC and TOY STORY are some of the best story and artwork ever.<br /><br />I was not thrilled with UP, but the odd, creative and totally unique moments make it worthwhile.<br /><br />The beginning is long, slow and depressing... and I almost stopped watching.<br /><br />The following elements won me over eventually:<br /><br />an old, old man trudging endlessly through strange adventures in South America forest and mountains attached via a garden hose to his floating house, which is held aloft by helium balloons.<br /><br />A huge troop of dogs wearing collars with translators that allow us to hear what they are saying. Funniest thing is the Alpha Dog is a doberman and his translator is broken and he sounds like a chipmunk.<br /><br />Even though the dogs are wearing translators they are still dogs and they are constantly distracted by the thought of a squirrel running by.<br /><br />As you can tell, these are way-out weird plot elements. They will not appeal to everyone. I can't believe they appealed to enough people so that this movie was actually made.<br /><br />All in all, it's a satisfying movie... and even makes us weep at one poignant moment.
0380799006|5.0|I knew the authors from another book called \\"How to talk so your children will listen and...\\" and as soon as I heard that the same writers had a book about how to handle having more than one child I knew they were my salvation (I am 7 months pregnant and a little bit worried about how we will  manage with hour 3-year old daughter once the baby is born). I received the book and read it in 3 days... really intersting. I underlined several passages and tips and I know that I will have to browse thorugh it again once I´ve had the baby. If you are about to buy it, just do it. Another thing: have a look at the other titles by the same authors, they are als worth reading.
B001U0HBPG|1.0|I bought this movie b/c I was hoping it would be a unique and meaningful spin on the short story upon which it is based.  It didn't really work b/c you could almost hear the Hollywood execs in the background asking for a hit that would be as successful as \\"Forrest Gump.\\"  All of the story & style elements were there, so you can see how it passed muster with the guys in the back room.<br /><br />1. It is told in a narrative that is identical to the Forrest Gump approach and the main characters have a southern drawl<br />2. It has a \\"Mama\\" figure in it, that pretty much serves the same function as the Sally Field role. She raises her misfit son, loves him unconditionally, says \\"you never know what's comin' after you\\" (aka \\"box of chocolates, never know what you're going to get, etc.) and she dies.<br />3. There is time spent on the seas with a crusty \\"Lieut Dan\\" type of character<br />4. Benjamin writes his love interest all the time from everywhere like FG<br />5. Cate Blanchett character even says \\"I gotta go pee\\" like FG does<br />6. There is no reason why the Cate Blanchett character would be that drawn to BB as the love of her life-- not to mention the notion that she comes across as somebody who is not into guys anyway.<br />7. BB becomes independently wealthy just like FG<br />8. BB voice over tells us what valuable lessons he's learned along his way just like FG<br /><br />BB is to FG what Lady Gaga is to Madonna.<br /><br />Stop the formulas, Hollywood.<br /><br />Or at least make them less obvious.<br /><br />In the end, a rather annoying and depressing movie.  Mostly annoying- unless you have not seen Forrest Gump.
B003F3NDP8|5.0|An excellent comeback from what Season 5 was. Susan and Mike are finally back together (let's hope it stays that way), Angie Bolen and her family are a much needed relief after Dave Williams and his mystery.  They added something unique to the show, but I'm glad they only stayed a season.  Even though the show isnt the same without Edie, it is beginning to be what it was in its early days again, and Season 7 will certainly see a continuation in this trend.
0143118420|5.0|I just finished reading EPL and LOVED it. While I admit that the author does get a little whiney and caught up with her own personal issues, I overlooked those facts by reminding myself that this is a memoir of a thirty-something aged woman on a personal search. Of course, she is going to voice all those feelings. If she didn't we would not get to know the true Elizabeth Gilbert. What really endeared me to the book was the transformation that Elizabeth experienced on her journey. There were so many hidden gems of wisdom in the book. It is a vivid reminder to each of us that we are on a journey as well. I would heartily recommend this book to anyone who enjoys poignant memoirs. Immerse yourself!
B002ZG98J6|2.0|What a disappointment.  After all, the book was terrific and the director is someone who has done 3 of my all time favorite movies (the first 2 Harry Potter, and Adventures in Babysitting).  Too many things were changed or omitted which totally changed the \\"feel\\" of the book.  The movie seemed rushed to cram a lot in, yet too many key topics were left out. First, the Luke-Kronos relationship was left out, which is the main plot of the 5 book series.  Then, the age of the kids were changed from 12 to 17, which blows away the age 16 prophecy part.      The acting was pretty terrible, too.  I would not be so harsh with my review, except that I know Chris Columbus can, and has done so much better.  Perhaps he was trying to avoid the obvious similarities with the Harry Potter series (2 boys and a girl battling a once-destroyed evil from coming back to power...), but in the process, the spirit of the novel was lost.
B002KSPKRS|5.0|My wife bought me this gaming headset for my birthday, and I can honestly say it's improved my game from the start.  I mostly play MW2, the headphones improve your ability to hear footsteps and sense direction of enemy players.  Helped the most in FFA but it's changed my game 100% for the better.  The sound quality is excellent; I haven't had a use for the 'bass boost' but it probably will have a purpose someday.  I have heard of people saying there is a 'static' in the background when using chat: it's minimal and you won't even notice it during the game.  Even when it's quiet you won't really pick it out.  It should not be a reason to avoid this headset.  I was worried about batteries vs. being wired, but the only batteries needed are for the headset itself and they last a good amount of time.  They are comfortable, your ears do NOT sweat (unlike some other headsets) and you have the ability to play for hours, with the volume UP, without bothering anyone.  You will be a better gamer with them, and yes, the wireless and 7.1 surround is worth the extra cash.  Buy these if you want to go positive more often.
B00009AHSO|4.0|Good sound quality and a good coverage of some of the best (most popular) songs of this band.

B003HLM2QO|5.0|Awesome -- if you like Ozzie you will love this.  Modern but still very much Ozzie.  Excellent guitar and voice -- good hard sounding rock.
B003A03RRU|5.0|At first, I was a little hesitant to purchase a complete collection of Sherlock Holmes. I decided the 99 cents were okay to gamble with, so I bought it. What a great find! Not only does this book have an active table of contents to each book, but it also has sub-chapters inside each book. This makes it seem as though you are navigating inside multiple books at once. The layout is crisp and clean, with appropriate spacing. Overall, I would suggest this book to all of my friends as a great way to read from Sir Arthur Conan Doyle's greatest character.
B002UJIY7A|3.0|This movie was like two movies joined together at the hip or something. The first half reminded me of a story in which every time you opened a door a ghost jumped out and said \\"Boo!\\" Eventually it's just not scary anymore. That's the first half.    Instead of a haunted house, this film is set in Hawaii. The scenery is spectacular. The key players are two couples who hike along a remote trail. They learn two newlyweds were brutally murdered just days before in Honolulu (they're on another island, Kauai) and have reason to suspect each other. There's a wicked looking knife, a hatchet, and fleeting glances of figures slipping through the dense tropical vegetation. One character, portrayed by the best actor of the lot, Timothy Olyphant, has a titanium plate in his skull (necessitated by an Iraq war wound, he claims) and likes to tell weird stories. Another character has a combative, menacing air. But the suspense factor hovered around zero. It was all rather mind numbing, although the cinematography was stunning.       Somewhere past the halfway point, however, it all took a sudden turn that completely surprised me. From then on, it was most exciting, although at the end I thought the two halves were not really part of the same whole. And, if only they could have edited out most of that catatonically boring first half.
B003S897U0|5.0|It is not a rehash of songs that all have been done before. There is a sentimental feel to every note and lyric. I feel sorry for the reviewer that can't hear the genuine affection for the songs and the connections those songs have made to their fans. Wow! Just wow! Thank you Crowes. You've more than earned a good long vacation.
B000056VJ7|5.0|my cd was recieved in the shape as advertised & the time promised.  thanks!
B002XMGGK6|4.0|The movie is full of suspense and surprises. I liked it very much - except for the last five minutes. The end is typically American: The »good« one has to win. Except that in my opinion he is NOT the good one. That left a bitter taste.
B00164CLXS|5.0|One of the greatest movies of my childhood.  Seriously, why is this not already being remastered and put on blu ray to share with future generations?!  A great movie intended for all to enjoy, please write the studios an email, write Stephen Spielberg and tell them to get this on Blu-Ray stat!
B002UXRGM0|5.0|Extraordinary photography makes this superb Blu-Ray viewing. Although along the same theme as 'Planet Earth' this one is slightly better, particularly with the close-up HD photography.  Images are stunning & I'm told the same 'Life' narrated by Oprah Winfrey is dull & dry; Richard Attenborough's version is the way to go!!  Easily 5 stars~
B0029LHW4U|5.0|This is one of the best rock albums, period - any year.  If you don't own this album, just go to YouTube and listen to the tracks.  These songs are heavy with a lot of attitude, and require repeat listening to gain real appreciation, which is normal for other great albums.  The focus is on Lane's influence and passing, a true tribute.<br />Did I mention, this is a great album!!
1857885082|5.0|When you are an ex-pat for a long enough time you begin to wonder what it is about you that is so different from everyone around you. Why do I share with delight that the big name-brand purse I'm carrying, and was complimented on, was bought at a discount store and get very odd results? Oh, I'm just being English. Why am I so frightfully horrified when people ask me how much I earn, or how expensive was my car? Oh... I see. I'm just operating under different rules. I've heard, and so far I've seen it to be true among my other English friends, we have trouble assimilating to other countries with the same ease most any other immigrant does. This book will remind you, you're not crazy, you're just English.

0321701763|5.0|Adobe Photoshop CS5 Classroom in a Book comes with a fine DVD-ROM for Windows and Mac OS filled with 2 hours of tutorials, and provides the easiest way to learn Photoshop CS5. The 'classroom' format centers around 14 lessons covering the basics of learning Photoshop and provides tips to become more productive with the program.

0452289963|5.0|Albert Einstein said, \\"No problem can be solved from the same level of consciousness that created it.\\" In A New Earth, Eckhart Tolle describes and puts us in the feel of a shift in consciousness that can solve humanities' problems of intolerance, hatred, violence and competition. If you seek to make this shift yourself, Tolle's books will a valuable resource. Is this shift real? Yes. In my work as a psychiatrist and as a licensed Avatar Master, I see awakenings everyday. Some may be considered small, but none are insignificant. For example, as Tolle guides us to experience the \\"inner body,\\" the mind quiets and senses heighten. This is a calmer yet more alert state of consciousness that will not react from fear but can act with wisdom and compassion. What a gift to yourself and those around you.
B00008BXJG|5.0|First i work like to say to all the people who gave this cd a one star review must have no taste in music whats so ever. This is a great album worth buying. GO OUT AND BUY IT NOW!

B000002JSP|4.0|Led Zeppelin's final studio album fares better than Presence.\\"In Through the Out Door\\" is a great title for an album. The songs have more structure and melody. \\"In the Evening\\" ,\\"Fool in the Rain\\", and \\"All My Love\\" are latter day Zeppelin classics. However, the rest of the album is awash with synthesizers and experimental rollicking songs like \\"South Bound Suarez\\" and \\"Hot Dog\\". These songs are servicable but increase one's yearning for an earlier meatier Led Zeppelin by album's end.
0061191981|4.0|I love Kitchen Nightmares and Hell's Kitchen, mostly for the way Chef Ramsay will give such unadulterated feedback. He doesn't sugar coat what doesn't work.  But, after he has broken through the crap, he shows tremendous compassion in a real way.    In his book, he tells his story, and you will see just what makes him tick.  His broken childhood and family troubles that followed him into adulthood.  His learning under some very harsh chefs in their own right.  His drive to be among the top chef's in the world of serious cooking.    I wouldn't say this book is great literature: he writes it as if he is telling you a story over a couple of pints.  There is a good flow, but sometimes he tends to move about in the flow.  This is not an in-depth look, but a man trying to let you know why he always appears to be in a bad mood.    Overall: if you're a fan of his shows, it s worth the read.
B000002JSJ|3.0|Led Zeppelin are legendary. However, Presence is sub-par for a band of so much talent. Achilles Last Stand is GREAT. The rest of the album lacks power. Presence is the closest thing to a Led Zeppelin \\"Jam\\" album. The musicianship is great but the songs dont gel into classics. Had Led Zeppelin taken another eighteen days to record, Presence might have been a different story.

0375434526|3.0|I can recall when I'd buy a Dan Brown for its challenging, controversial and exciting content and because it was a guaranteed exciting read. I picked this book up as I'd just read something challenging and exciting and beautifully written, Ascension by Stephen Galloway; now I needed an easy, non-taxing, holiday read, something I could whizz through without much thought; this is what Dan Brown had become to me.<br /><br />For those who have read the previous Robert Langdon episodes; 'Angels and Demons' and the cosmically successful 'The Da Vinci Code'; you would immediately recognise the 'symbolically' familiar format that is a Langdon adventure. We have the Indiana Jones of Symbology himself, Robert Langdon; the essential heroine, Katherine Solomon; the insane and fanatically driven bad guy; the mysterious, if at least not religious, organisation; The Freemasons; and a grizzly discovery, all brought together in the capitol of the U.S.A. Washington D.C.<br /><br />All sounding too familiar? It was. However! This book did spark a new interest in me for a previously unknown area of scientific study - Noetics; there are many cool and interesting facts about the Masons; the father's of the new world and the strange D.C. architecture to amaze even the most sceptical mind; at one point I was convinced that Robert Langdon had, at last been terminated from modern literature permanently; and I was completely caught out by an unexpected but possibly obvious plot twist towards the end.<br /><br />The End? Possibly the longest ending since Lord of The Rings: The Fellowship of the Ring. Brown dragged it out longer than Sean Bean's demise in that same film.<br /><br />Come on Dan Brown! Forget Langdon and give us something as fabulous again as, in my opinion, your best book to date, Deception Point. Come on Ritchie Cunningham or whatever your name is - When's that film coming out?<br /><br />Look! The Lost Symbol isn't awful, it's an OK throw-away vacation read full of interesting \\"facts\\" you can get in greater detail on the net or Discovery. Buy it, enjoy it, (I did) but don't expect it to Wow you as did the Da Vinci Code.on the net or Discovery. Buy it, enjoy it, (I did) but don't expect it to Wow you as did the Da Vinci Code.
B000VLOKQI|4.0|Considering all that has been written about The Who by music critics, biographers and pop journalists, there is not much left to say about this forceful, inventive and influential English rock aggregate. Thanks to \\"Amazing Journey\\", however, there are still fresh things to see.<br />  The twin DVDs in this set produced by Nigel Sinclair, Bill Curbishley and Robert Rosenberg include \\"The Story of The Who\\" and \\"Six Quick Ones\\". These documentaries assemble live performances and recording sessions, archival newsreels, television and movie clips, interviews with the principals, their managers, producers, family, friends, and fellow rock musicians (Sting, The Edge, Eddie Vedder, Noel Gallgher, Steve Jones, and others) from 1964 through 2003.<br />  \\"The Story of The Who\\" tracks the band's career from the earliest days of their emergence from among scores of English performers scrambling for attention in the wake of the commercial tsunami known as the \\"British Invasion\\" of 1964, spearheaded by The Beatles' successful penetration of the American marketplace.<br />  The extraordinary thing about this footage is that there is so much of it. That is owed to The Who's first managers, Chris Stamp and Kit Lambert - entertainment industry promoters with no particular ear for pop music - who surveyed the lively London scene in the spring of '64 looking for a promising group to manage and to film in action for a movie. Their selection of The Who - then billing themselves as The High Numbers - for their project proved to be miraculous. Suppose they had picked Herman's Hermits or The Dave Clark Five? They could not have foreseen any more than the band themselves did that The Who would become rock immortals.<br />  The hits started coming immediately. \\"I Can't Explain\\", \\"The Kids Are Alright\\", \\"My Generation\\", \\"Magic Bus\\", \\"Happy Jack\\", and \\"I Can See For Miles\\" were chartbusters in Great Britain and the U.S.A. The documentary cameras continued to roll. The Who recorded an advertising jingle for Coca-Cola , which inspired their first concept album \\"The Who Sell Out\\".<br />  One could isolate The Who's four consecutive studio albums \\"The Who Sell Out\\" (1968), \\"Tommy\\" (1969), \\"Who's Next\\" (1971), and \\"Quadrophenia\\" (1973) to bury in a time capsule with assurance that, when unearthed by archaeologists 2,000 years hence, the vigor, spirit, urges, concerns, and musical vocabulary of the first quarter century of rock 'n roll would be amply represented and potently distilled.<br />  The Who were by no means a seamless ensemble. Musically and temperamentally they were more distinguished by their individuality than by their cohesion. The subtraction of any one of their members, though, would have meant a sundering of the whole, a fact sadly demonstrated in 1978 when rambunctious drummer Keith Moon died shortly after the release of \\"Who Are You?\\", the band's last  hit. Each of the three other band mates ventured solo careers. Roger Daltry struggled to find suitable material for his rugged voice. John Entwhistle harnessed melodic, ostinato-free bass figures with brass sections and his sardonic sense of humor in several albums, but could not sustain commercial viability. Only Pete Townshend possessed sufficient artistry and imagination to craft exciting, affecting songs in his own right.<br />  If there had ever been any doubts, it became clear in later years that The Who had been Pete Townshend's band all along. The tensile strength in Townshend's direct, introspective writing embodied thoughtful vulnerability even as his music summoned thunder. The Who wanted their performances to be seen and felt as much as heard. Their decibel level pressurized eardrums and their stage antics - with the windmill guitar chords, the amplifiers pounded for feedback, and the furious destruction of guitars and drum kits - suggested rage shrugging off restraint.<br />  The band members were notoriously fractious. In their interviews, Daltry and Townshend are candid about their difficulties in working together, as well as their personal weaknesses, creative failures, and affection for intoxicating substances.<br />  \\"Six Quick Ones\\" is designed to be complementary with \\"The Story of The Who.\\" It covers some of the same material, including some of the same interviews and documentary footage. Where the first film presents a chronological history of The Who, the second is organized into six segments (plus bonus material) bringing into focus each of the band's four members, a study of the group's conceptual framework and art school influences, and a recording session that spotlights The Who as constituted in 2003.<br />  All writing about music suffers from being naturally unmusical. Its purpose is typically critical, expository, or promotional. Even if it were cast in lyric poetry with inspired phonemes and complex rhythms, it would still be language, absent melodic pitch, timbre, harmony, and sonic dimension. This review of \\"Amazing Journey\\" can offer only arid sentiment and parched opinion. The DVDs invite the viewer with a thirst for The Who or for the popular music of the '60s and '70s to sip cool draughts straight from the wellspring.es in working together, as well as their personal weaknesses, creative failures, and affection for intoxicating substances.      \\"Six Quick Ones\\" is designed to be complementary with \\"The Story of The Who.\\" It covers some of the same material, including some of the same interviews and documentary footage.

I just got done watching it an hour ago and I can't wait to see it again!
B0011FDVKE|4.0|A steady, quietly but firmly self-confident woman.  Her somewhat thin, reedy, but sure soprano is easy to listen to.  She is a more mainstream version of Kasey Chambers, a quieter sister of Gail Davies, or a more countrified cousin of Dar Williams.  Tunes are attractive; lyrics rarely assert themselves, but never sound generic.  Settings are mainly solid, standard country, never generic.  Strong songs are very strong.  The rest are more innocuous than weak.  Are her strengths enough?  All the chills tell me that this will grow on me.  Stand outs:  tr 3:  Another country.  \\"Love is another country.\\"  Her quiet, soft, heartfelt voice is hopeful, never yearning, as though in a quiet reverie of possibilities.  Lovely.  Chills.  tr 4--Hopes too high.  The easy reediness of her voice again lets us in unobtrusively as the song choogles along quietly.  Lovely.  tr 5--Morning is my destination.  Positive, heartland music in which she asserts more than hopes that \\"morning is my destination.\\"  tr 7--I know what I'm looking for.  As she asserts the next stage of her life quietly, tensions of determination and loss bring chills.  tr 10--Tender branch.  Her reedy voice carries her firmly along a carelessly meandering ¾-time melody in a spare setting.  Tr 11--Mille tendresses.  A quiet, languorous, 2/4-time rumination in French, with discretely churchy piano, organ.

0307454541|5.0|Mikael Blomqvist is a financial reporter who has just been found guilty of libel in his investigation of the Wennerstrom Corporation. His career in ruins, his finances in tatters and with a few months to get his life in order before he goes to jail he is a man adrift.  When he is approached by Henrik Vanger to investigate the disappearance of his niece Harriet 40 years earlier, Blomkvist takes on the project, especially because Vanger promises to give him information that will take down Wennerstrom.<br /><br />Lisabeth Sanders is a multi-pierced, multi tattooed young woman with severe anti-social problems. She works for the Milton Security Company, doing freelance investigations and deep backround checks on people. When she is hired to investigate Blomkvist she is slowly drawn into the Vanger story and soon Mikael and Lisabeth's paths will cross, changing both of their lives forever.<br /><br />The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo is a crime thriller, but it is not formulaic at all. It touches on a number of topics, including the greed of corporations with no regard for consequences, Nazism, sexual mores and abuse.<br /><br />The story is a little slow moving at first, but when the Vanger investigation takes off it moves at a breakneck pace.  Although Larsson is juggling a number of story lines he is able to weave them all together in an involving and satisfying manner.<br /><br />There are a lot of characters in this book but Lisabeth and her story is the one we end up caring most about. This is a woman who is brilliant yet unlikeable, she does not know how to interact with or trust people.  She is tiny yet she can be brutal, giving off a sense of danger lurking just beneath. As her story unfolds we see the vulnerability hidden away, Lisabeth has been treated very poorly by society; she is betrayed and abused by people, mostly men, time and time again.  She also has a black and white sense of wrong and right, her own moral code; Lisbeth has no problems exacting revenge on those she believes most deserving of it. As she tries to learn the boundaries of her friendship with Mikael, we are rooting for her to find her place in the world, hoping against hope that everything will turn out okay for her.<br /><br />The ending of the book, while satisfying to some extent, is very open ended, making one anxious to pick up the next book in the series.serving of it.

B0026IQFS0|5.0|The first in a series of twenty sailing ship sagas set in early 19th century. Characters are well developed and believable. Very authentic, especially the descriptions of the sail- and ship-handling. Kinda like being in a full-immersion foreign language course. Great fun as well as historically instructive.                                                                           Weber

It is based on simple examples that show the language features, getting to reasonably advanced topics such as using a timer and handling images. While this book is aimed at beginners, it's a good place to start for experienced programmers who want a quick overview of the language without wading through wordy explanations of elementary topics.
0670034711|1.0|If you like the inspirational words of Randy Pausch or the political greats, then don't bother picking this one up. I couldn't have been less inspired by reading this book.  I found it self-indulgent, and awkwardly shallow, as the hardships faced by this woman are the typical hardships faced by everyone, and in fact, she leads a somewhat charmed life.  (It read more like a Britney Spears biography would, then anyone of any philosophical import.)  The more I read, the more I felt sorry that I was wasting time with this book and this whiney woman.   After reading other inspirational stories (a la Randy Pausch), this book was just sad.  I can't believe it was a best-seller.  There are places in the book where I laughed, not because it was funny, but because I couldn't believe how self-centered this woman seemed.  To tell you the truth, I got more moved by comedienne Kathy Griffin's biography, which was written as a bit of a gag with realism interspersed, than this realism that just seemed like the ultimate joke to someone shelling out money for this tripe.  I can only hope the movie is better than the book.

B0034G4OU4|3.0|Like anyone who has the slightest interest in seeing this 2010 film, I was seduced by the Travel Channel images in the trailer and the sight of a radiant Julia Roberts in her first full-fledged star vehicle since 2003's [[ASIN:B0001ADAVK Mona Lisa Smile]]. She appears in almost every frame of this 133-minute emotional travelogue, and the introspective story based on Elizabeth Gilbert's 2006 memoir, [[ASIN:0143118420 Eat, Pray, Love: One Woman's Search for Everything Across Italy, India and Indonesia]], needs someone of Roberts' star wattage to give it a recognizable pulse. The challenge faced by director/writer Ryan Murphy ([[ASIN:B0032JTV6U Glee]]) and his co-screenwriter, former actress Jennifer Salt, is how to make something dramatic out of what is essentially an inward quest toward self-fulfillment without turning the whole venture into a mire of clich&eacute;s that passes for dramatic structure. They don't actually succeed, but somehow Roberts' goodwill and infectious manner, missing for most of the decade, overcome much of this obstacle in her sympathetic portrayal of Gilbert.<br /><br />After a brief preface in Bali where Gilbert interviews a prophetic medicine man who forecasts her love life, the plot begins in earnest with Gilbert's emotional meltdown back in New York six months later. Liz (as the character is called in the movie) divorces her flaky husband Stephen who has upended their marriage with plans to go back to school. She rebounds in a passionate affair with David, a younger actor, but recognizes how she again submerges her own identity in the relationship. In order to halt this recurring pattern and find enlightenment toward her true self, Liz decides to take a trip around the world with three destinations in mind - Italy where she eats, India where she prays, and Bali where she falls in love. Her first stop is Rome, where a young Italian tutor teaches her the art of doing nothing. With the help of her new Swedish best friend, this means accepting the ten extra pounds on her frame due to a steady diet of pasta and pizza. Liz then moves on to an Indian ashram where she receives essential spiritual guidance from a tough-talking Texan named Richard.<br /><br />She finally comes back to Bali to reunite with the medicine man and then accidentally meets Felipe, a recently divorced Brazilian who may or may not turn out to be her soul mate. Because Murphy and Salt appear intent on remaining faithful to the book, they attempt to cover too much for a feature-length film. Secondary characters become trivialized, and situations become rushed and pat. Take, for example, Liz's relationship with a healer named Wayan in Bali. So moved is Liz by Wayan's plight, she emails all her previous travel acquaintances to send money in order to buy Wayan and her young daughter a house. Yet, we get very little sense of any meaningful friendship between the characters. That's because the movie fails to capture the deep emptiness of Liz's soul that would drive her to make this life-altering journey. This is what the author did better in the source book, i.e., show the underbelly of Liz's despair through insightful comments and some pithy prose. As the movie stands, it's left to Roberts to flesh out the character's emotions without sounding like a whining, privileged woman of means. It's no small feat.<br /><br />When not providing the sometimes smug narration, Roberts is luminous but not the film's only standout. Even though his character has to provide the hoariest bromides, Richard Jenkins ([[ASIN:B0015OKWKI The Visitor]]) manages to bring fiery heart and gravitas to the Texan who forces Liz to take a hard look at herself. As Felipe, Javier Bardem ([[ASIN:B001DJ7PR8 Vicky Cristina Barcelona]]) has to play the feminist ideal of the modern man and consequently comes across almost too evolved to be honestly compelling. Less impactful turns are provided by Billy Crudup as Stephen (though his scene at Liz's divorce lawyer's office providesa much-needed edge to the story), James Franco rather morose as David, and Viola Davis ([[ASIN:B001PA0FFO Doubt]]) as wisecracking best friend and editor Delia (similar to the role she played in [[ASIN:B0017ANB08 Nights in Rodanthe]]). Robert Richardson provides the rich cinematography that captures the ripeness of each exotic location down to the luscious pasta dishes in Rome. In fact, aficionados of both the Food Network and the Travel Channel will likely rejoice at the visual pleasures in this film. The rest of us will have to make do with Julia in her prime.ory), James Franco rather morose as David, and Viola Davis ([[ASIN:B001PA0FFO Doubt]]) as wisecracking best friend and editor Delia (similar to the role she played in [[ASIN:B0017ANB08 Nights in Rodanthe]]).

B003GEDLW6|5.0|I have been following Pendulum since their first studio release, and I have to say that their albums are getting better & better. In Silico is one of my favorite albums of all-time.  I have been listening to Immersion exclusively for the past few weeks and am really into it - I can't say that I love all the tracks though, as they have incorporated some new voice talent for a few tracks that I wasn't thrilled with.      Overall, this is a worthy studio release and with tracks like \\"The Island\\", they are continuuing to push and grow the DnB genre.  Watercolour, Under The Waves, and Witchcraft are my favorites!
B000AYEL6U|5.0|As of this writing the product information here at Amazon says the aspect ratio is 1.33:1, but that is INCORRECT. I own the DVD and assure you it is 1.78:1 (16:9 anamorphic widescreen).     I tried to submit a change to Amazon, but in their infinite wisdom they rejected it, telling me that their review of \\"authoritative sources\\" concludes that their information is correct. Well, sorry Amazon, but you and your sources are wrong, wrong, wrong. So get a clue.    The program itself is great. Very entertaining. Video quality is fair, not top-notch. I would really like to see a Blu-ray version for this.
B0035RFYT2|5.0|Not quite as large as the Safari wolves, Schleich nevertheless produces a high-quality figurine that's durable enough for playtime and pretty enough for display.  Please note Schleich is fond of making their figures anatomically-correct (this one's a male).  For a more gender-neutral alternative, I recommend the Safari wolves.<br /><br />Other than that, he's perfect.

B0013E5HEG|5.0|Durable, realistic - it's great for play or display!  Schleich's done it again. The eyes are very expressive, the mane has several different colors/highlights the way a natural lion's mane would, and every detail has been perfectly sculpted into place.<br /><br />As always, Schleich items are 100% anatomically correct so parents should make themselves aware of that.<br /><br />Still, he definitely rules my little lion pride.  :)
B001TH8UUA|5.0|I have a 1.5m Monster HDMI cable that I paid over a $100.00 for that is made of the highest quality materials and procedures. I needed a longer cable and didn't want to spend alot of money again on a new one. So I ordered this cable for a fraction of the the cost of a Monster cable and it performs just as good if not better as the Monster cable. You could buy about15 of Amazon's cables for the cost of just one Monster cable. Great job Amazon for a great   product with an unbelivable price.

Finley, newly appointed chief investigator. During their conversation, Finley seems sympathetic while Reacher attempts to convince him of his innocence.<br /><br />A cell phone is found by the body of the dead man. The phone belongs to a man named Paul Hubble and when questioned, Hubble cracks and confesses to the murder. However, Hubble was at a social event when the murder happened and could not be the killer.<br /><br />Reacher uses his skills learned when he was with the Military Police and had been a homicide investigator. He has to figure out what is happening in this small town in Georgia. To do this, he has only two people that he can trust, Capt. Finley and an attractive police officer named Roscoe, with whom he becomes romantically involved.<br /><br />He learns that the scheme has something to do with finance, and, in particular, with counterfeiting. Reacher and his two allies must uncover the scheme and put a stop to the criminals before Sunday because that is when the Coast Guard will relax it's patrolling of the coast.<br /><br />The characters are well portrayed. Reacher and the honest members of the police force are dedicated, brave and determined. The antagonists are arrogant, brutal and truly evil.<br /><br />This is the kind of story that, when finished, the reader can sit back, breathe a sigh and congratulate the author for writing an exceptional novel.

Most recently I've looked up Shandong province (I have a friend there) and Gansu province where all the flooding has occurred.  I can connect to people directly through the pictures.  This book is an important connection to China and the world with stunning and captivating photography and pertinent and insightful commentary.
B003IPC5SO|5.0|Kylie has done it again!  Consistently pleasing pop pleasure.  Kylie should be at the top of the charts with this one.  However, once again in the U.S., Kylie is only heard in the clubs.  Get Out of My Way is a bitchy classic which is a great song to listen to when you're in traffic.  The beautiful, \\"Everything is Beautiful\\" adds balance to the beat heavy disc.  The title track is sassy and instantly hypnotic.  Other hightlights include the lead single \\"All the Lovers\\" and the future dancefloor smash \\"Put Your Hands Up\\" Overall,  Kylie delivers another great CD.  A competent follow up to her last disc X.  If you like great dance music that you can sing along to, Aphrodite is the CD for you.

This man has been through so much in his life and when most people would crumble and not get back up, Dave, breaks through and takes a step higher! And on top of all that, he has the best band in the world! This book has made me have so much more respect for him than I already had. I felt it was a true honor to be able to read his thoughts, trials and tribulations. The only downside to the book is that I would have liked for it to be a bit longer. It seemed that the most recent events in his life were squeezed together in the end and it left me wanting more. Maybe he'll write another book in the future? One could only hope! Great job, Dave! Thank you!
0525951652|4.0|This book (or should I same tome) is a great saga for readers who want a varied cast of characters placed with precision into World War I.  Follett drew sharp class distinctions which fomented the rise of the working class and presented history based on real events.  Through five interconnected Welsh, American, German, Russian and English families, he carries the reader through this historical period with his usual brilliant research.<br /><br />The characters are perfectly placed in their roles:  Billy, the Welsh child who is sent down to the mines at 13 years old, two Russian brothers who, although, separated, are reunited by coincidence, Ethel who is smart and tries to move above her station with disastrous results, the American Dewar who is sensitive to the plight of the peasants and so on.  These somewhat stereotyped characters and the incidents are contrived.  I wanted to read about more atypical characters situated in bizarre incidents. Follett is a great story-teller and the reader should be confident with his accuracy about the events and power plays leading up to WWI.  One must keep in mind, however, that it is an historical novel and many conversations are embellished or created for purpose of the plot<br /><br />Follett certainly provoked a strong dislike for the upper class, particularly the Russians.  I disliked Princess Bea when she was introduced and empathized with the Russian peasants who believed the Tsar loved them as he ordered their hanging. The upper classes are fascinating.  No one can speak until the King (George V) speaks and beating your servants is a good thing. Social justice will prevail ultimately and we are also anxious for a woman's right to vote, but although this is a great page turner (almost 1000 pages!), it is loaded with cliches.  I give Follett an A for history and C+ for characterization.  In hardcover, this book will be very heavy.  It is heavy in pre-publication format; I did not carry it on the train to work!
B002ZG977Y|5.0|My husband & I thoroughly enjoyed this. It is very different from the 'Original' & that this movie has its own merits. I believe that having taken out the romantic interest with the \\"Princess\\" & making it more a \\"Quest\\" of revenge by a rebel \\"Demi-God\\" has made this movie more effective.  This movie has great visual effects, a bit of humour when needed & a cast of characters/actors that go and 'Kick some Titan butt'.

B003INBNXO|5.0|\\"Ip man\\" the best martial art flick since Jet Li's \\"Fist Of Legend\\", not to forget the Tony Jaa films, this Ip Man delivers, as so does Donnie Yen in his best role yet, Yen is a natural as the part of the great Wing Chun master known to his peers as Ip Man.. the stage is set for hard hitting, non-stop action, done so in the old school way with a fast-paced storyline, similar in concept to the classic \\"Chinese Connection\\". It's not hard to tell observing the Wing Chun style, here lies the roots and heritage of the legendary Bruce Lee. A must see film of the genre, \\"Ip Man\\" never lets up, much better than anticipated. The format is 16x9 widescreen, English or the original Mandarin languages are optional, including the making of Ip Man - interviews with Donnie Yen and Sammo Hung. The disc cover advertises Ip Man as \\"the best martial arts film ever\\", I don't know about that, as the loosely-based storyline of \\"Yip Man\\" continuously rolls with the action, it's safe to say, definitely in the top twenty of the genre.

I personally have enjoyed this book because of the descriptions and advice she gives about cooking. We have yet to actually follow an exact recipe in this book; but are planning on making the Boeuf Bourguignon as soon as I can get to the store. I don't know much about French cooking but this book seems to give a pretty good idea of how do it (besides adding copious amounts of butter). Fun book, highly recommend; watch the movie and this book will mean that much more to you!

1439153663|5.0|This book certainly doesn't sugar coat any of the goings-on in the late 1790s.  There is much sadness and death, but the story is so engaging that it is difficult to put down.  I found myself stealing five minutes here and there just to find out what was going to happen next.  Lavinia, the naive indentured servant who is the main focus of the book, is hard not to root for, despite the mistakes she makes along the way.  Although I became frustrated with Belle, the black woman who is required to care for Lavinia, at times, her loyalty and passion for her family was remarkable.  One of the best books I read this summer.

B00000I3JO|5.0|track three, \\"let's go out tonight,\\" came on my iPOD at random, and i thought about how it reminded me of all the pensive-sounding spreingsteen hit's i love, like \\"secret garden,\\" and \\"streets of philadelphia\\" and \\"i'm on fire.\\"  and then my mind switched gears a bit, and i suddenly wished springsteen would pursue that direction in his music more. _hats_ is a collection of sad, atmospheric pop music not unlike the aforementioned springsteen tunes.  some might call it \\"downtempo\\" or whatever, and i agree, just not in the MASSIVE ATTACK sense of the word.  the songs here do use a lot of keyboards- as there ain't much guitar at all- but the music has a more organic feel to it, like the instruments are being played on spot.  paul buchanan's soft croon fits very nicely with the music, and has a quality to it that makes me feel as if these songs were recorded shortly after they were crafted- as if they never had a chance to grow tiresome for the band- because the vulnerability in his voice seems so real and fresh and not forced or overdone.  the music is simple and accessible but not commercial, and good enough to make you just kind of shake your head at a sound you suspect many more people could enjoy if only they could hear it.  this record has a tendency to make me project feelings of loneliness into my surroundings.

I've owned this book for a while now but just, tonight, got around to trying a recipe from it.<br /><br />And I'll be honest, I'm not dinging it because its recipes contain sugar. Or white flour. Or earth balance. Or ener-g. Vegan is not synonymous with \\"health food\\" and I'm perfectly happy with a \\"non-creative\\" recipe once in a while. Sometimes, even a vegan just wants a plain ole chocolate chip cookie.<br /><br />And when that's you - wanting a plain ole chocolate chip cookie - run away from this book. Yes, I purchased it, in large part, because of that gorgeous cover photo. Tonight I made the accompanying recipe. It was a total disaster. I am convinced the cookies in the photos *did not* come from the recipe in the book. I followed the directions. I have a gram scale, even. (I wasn't lying when I said I'm not a novice baker.)<br /><br />The dough was way too wet. The little voice in my head - that apparently belongs to my inner, more-skilled-than-cookbook-authors, baker - was nagging me about the wet dough. I convinced myself that, no, it's fine. Look at that photo. Maybe *my* dough is always too dry. My cookies never look that delicious. And the directions don't say to flatten the dough. They'll be just fine.<br /><br />But, no, just as I suspected, these cookies spread like a plague and came out of the oven thin, crumbly, and oily. They are now in my 'fridge, packed in napkins to absorb some of the excess oil and hopefully render them a little closer to \\"edible\\".<br /><br />It's hard to screw up fat, flour and chocolate. Kudos to this book/recipe for managing to. &lt;/sarcasm>
0670021652|1.0|BORING to the point that you want to throw up!  It's not a sceptic making peace with marriage, it's a paranoid rumbling on and on and on about her chaotic observations and research.  The only reason I actually finished reading it is because I was stock with it during my vacation.  The boredom of the book actually effected my impression of the entire vacation.  That bad! I generally like her writing style, her sense of humor agrees with me. Gilbert is a good writer and a nice person, but obviously obsessed and disturbed with a subject of marriage (like she's the only one who's been divorced or like she fell off the Moon and trying to find out why people pair up) and her book is annoying.  Who in the world ever agreed to publish this?!  Her extensive research would go nicely in about 100 pages including narrative about her boyfriend's and her immigration story, but it probably does not make sense to publish anything under 300 page.  So, she milked her obsession into 300 pages making it virtually impossible to read. It's a shame that her writing talent has to be wasted on works like this!
B00005JLIU|4.0|This movie is quite long, over  two hours and 18 minutes, and for many that could be boring.  On the other hand there are plenty of skits and sarcasm to put a spring to your step and a smile on your face.<br /><br />At first the films seems very proud of itself, with not a lot of plot and mostly just a lot of excuses for Julie Andrews to sing.  As the story plays out, the second half gets more into plot, and even there it is a comedy routine.<br /><br />Playing like a silent film, we have a few title cards representing Julie's thoughts as she thinks about her friends and loves.  And there are loooong intermissions of nothing but music, music, music.  It's time for popcorn and a soda, and then back to the movie.<br /><br />Julie plays Millie Dillmount, who has a plan:  get a job, marry the boss and then live happily ever after.  But she runs into a crazy kid named Jimmy and knows she loves him but must find a man who can take care of her.  Jimmy teaches her the Tapioca -- tap tap.<br /><br />Mary Tyler Moore, not yet the apple of Lou Grant's eye in the popular Mary Tyler Moore Show, plays a shy, naive girl who has checked into the Priscilla Hotel for Single Girls, and is targeted as a victim in a white slavery plot!<br /><br />Even this potential bit of darkness is polished off with style and comedy.  But as I said, this film is quite long.  If you're going to rent it, turn up your TV and at the appropriate intermissions fix yourself some cheese and crackers.<br /><br />You have time.<br /><br />Other Favorite Julie Andrews Films:<br /><br />[[ASIN:B00068NVG6 Rodgers & Hammerstein's Cinderella (1957 Television Production)]]<br />[[ASIN:B000AP04OM The Sound of Music (Two-Disc 40th Anniversary Special Edition)]]<br />[[ASIN:B00003CXD9 Victor/Victoria]]<br />[[ASIN:0788812262 Mary Poppins [VHS]]]

0307474712|5.0|just a delightful read. A structurally bold undertaking, telling a story by visiting the characters the same day every year, but it works surprisingly well.  Now that I finished the book, I find myself missing the characters.
B003A4IFGY|5.0|Always look forward to any type of release from Petty,either solo or with The Hbr's...Never had a negative look at any of his work as Petty always looks to twist his sound.Of course you're not going to like all of it,but always applaude Petty for his exploring and not caring for what critics want.On Mojo,Petty revisits his patented sound.It has the rockers and the slower Petty songs. Pretty much,songs 1-16 are real good.Each offers a different sound and speed.Mojo will go down as a classic and one of my fave Petty albums.If you have been a fan of Petty since the beginning,why stop here??? Get it now and enjoy the classic sound of The One,The only Petty~~~~

B003S897U0|5.0|Perhaps it may be the last album from The Crowes.If it is,it's the best way to go out.On Top!!!!  Pretty much from beg. to end,it is a collection of many of the great songs of The Crowes,done acoustically.If you have been a fan of them from the beginning,this album would be a great addition,perhaps the last in your Crowes collection...Through the years they have given us great albums,with different twists and sounds.None ever disappointed and if you are a true fan,you should feel the same.They picked songs from many of their albums and stripped them down.The Black Crowes do it just right.Acoustic is awesome and the Crowes did it so many times through the years...Go get it now if you haven't yet...Long live The Crowes~~~~An American Legend...
B000068FY0|4.0|A great album then and now.  Listening to the CD brought back too many memories.  What great times those were.  I will say however, that technology is not always a good thing.  The \\"remastered\\" music leaves some to be desired relative to the original vinyl.  Too many high highs and low lows are cut off.  Listening for the simple pleasure of the music in a car or on a small stereo this was satisfying.  Listening to this on a high end stereo system identifies the flaws of digitizing the music.
B002ZG999U|3.0|Barney Ross (Sylvester Stallone) is a man with nothing to lose. Fearless and void of emotion, he is the Leader, the Sage and the Strategist of this tight-knit band of men who live on the fringe. His only attachment is to his pickup truck, his seaplane and his team of loyal modern-day warriors. His is a true cynic who describes what he does as \\"removing those hard to get at stains\\". The team behind him is made up of Lee Christmas (Jason Statham), former SAS and a savant with anything that has a blade; Yin Yang (Jet Li), a master at close-quarter combat; Hale Caesar (Terry Crews), who has known Barney for ten years and is a long-barrel weapons specialist; Toll Road (Randy Couture), a skilled demolitions expert and considered the intellect of the group; and Gunnar Jensen (Dolph Lundgren), a combat veteran and an expert in precision sniping who struggles with his own demons.<br /><br />With the all-star -cast, the expectations are naturally very high, and whether director Sylvester Stallone simply could deliver will remain a subject of debate for a long time. Keeping aside Bruce Willis, Crews or Mickey Rourke (painting guitars and smoking pipe), Jet Li and Dolph Lundgren were expected to have a solo fight scene each.
B002SJIO4A|2.0|This movie has received quite a bit of positive attention, and I must say I'm at a loss to understand.  I've read through the positive reviews here and understand that people like it, but I I'm still not sure why.  I will concede that it is impressively made and that the lead actor does a very good job (although I wouldn't say the same for the rest of the cast).  However, the script is a little weak and filled with questionable character motiviations and plot twists seemingly designed to eke out the maximum amount of gore from the project.  But my main gripe is that when all is done, the film doesn't accomplish anything.    The first 10 minutes of the film sets up a potentially interesting premise.  The following 20 or 30 minutes sets up a plot twist that could have lead to a fascinating follow up.  What happens instead, unfortunately, is a 90 minute shoot-'em-up manhunt that squanders any potential set up by the beginning.  Not only is it disappointing, but it's kind of disgusting to watch.    The violence is both explicit and relentless, and all of it is gratuitous.  The film EASILY could have achieved its aims with only a tenth of the gore.  Pathetic.  And of course it doesn't skim on the grotesque, showing agonizing acts of mayhem and painful biological transition.  If you like movies like \\"Saw\\" or \\"Hostel,\\" you might have a taste for this style of film making, but I avoid such films like the plague.    The way the film chose to portray the alien race was bizarre.  With the exception of one father and his son, it was a race of savages, a bipedal equivalent of ravenous jackals.  (Now that I think of it, the humans in the film weren't portrayed any better.)  As such, it is difficult to know what to make of the situation--are we to pity them because of the oppression they suffer, or are the humans justifiably confining them for their (the humans') own protection?  The film could have served as an analogy to apartheid or anti-immigration sentiment, but without eliciting a shred of empathy for either side, it falls flat in this regard.    So, then, what's with the oft-cited praise that this film is somehow a \\"parable for our times\\"?  A parable?  What's the message, then?  That all living creatures are despicable?  That it's only a matter of time before rival sects destroy one another?  That we have nothing better to do with 90 minutes of our time than to watch exploding heads and acts of mayhem?  Indeed, I implore anyone who applauds this movie to tell what they learned from it.  (There very well could be something that I'm not getting--I really want to know!)    As Eckhart Tolle would say, this is a move made by pain-bodies for pain-bodies.  I'm still a weasel and a wretch, but there must be hope for me, because this movie turned my stomach.    Still, fair is fair.  Two stars for the effort put into it, the lead actor, and the special effects.  Also, this movie was strongly recommended to me by someone whose opinion I respect, so your reaction to this horrifically ugly movie may vary from mine (see what I did there?).

B0037W68F4|4.0|Just gotta say that when I first heard \\"Flash delirium\\" on the radio, my head blew apart !! I couldn't believe that it was the same band that did \\"Electric feel\\"  Then I heard the song \\"Brian Eno\\" and that was it...I had to check this out. Listening to the disc I was surprised at a psychedelic feast. Lots of reverb makes the music float around. Not a fan of all the songs but in my opinion \\"Flash delirium\\" is worth the price of the whole disc! And any band that writes about Brian Eno deserves my  respect. The insert also shows and EMS vcs3 synthesizer like the one Eno played in Roxy music.  Cool stuff....

1601251505|5.0|I aim this review at people wondering whether to go with D&D 4th Edition (4e) or Pathfinder, clicking back and forth between the two on Amazon like I was when deciding which system to run with my friends, all of whom are new to tabletop RPGs. However, there is a caveat to this review, in that I am brand-new to tabletop RPGs and have not yet played 4e. Still, I obsessed(!) about this, read the rulebooks for both editions, and simulated both on my own to the extent that I can. I welcome comments that can flesh out or critique what I am about to say.<br /><br />Twenty-two years ago, when I was ten or so, I obsessively read over the manuals and some early adventures for the Basic Dungeons & Dragons ruleset. However, I never found a group that shared my passion - video games and the Nintendo Entertainment System were occupying most people my age. I was no exception and soon moved on to video and computer games to get the closest I could get to the \\"genuine\\" role-playing experience.<br /><br />Fast forward to the present day, and I am beginning tabletop RPGs for the first time, attracted by the freedom for imagination and the collective experience that they bring.<br /><br />I chose Pathfinder because I was attracted to the attention to \\"realism\\" (to the extent one can say realism exists in an imagined fantasy world - the word I've seen used is \\"verisimilitude\\"). I was turned off by the idea in D&D 4th Edition of critically-wounded characters taking a night's sleep and waking up without a scratch, and the mystical \\"healing surges\\" (which 4e doesn't even attempt to give an in-game justification for) that characters can employ during and between encounters. The disdaining comparisons between 4e and World of Warcraft and other video games, while often over-simplified and overused, does have merit in that 4e is focused on providing a specific gaming experience that, while attractive and highly-enjoyable to those who prefer more of the action, pacing and feel of video games, just wasn't my cup of tea.<br /><br />On the other hand, Pathfinder's (and previously D&D 3.5 Edition's) commitment to \\"realism\\" also added another order of complexity to the gaming system. This was the main reason why I hesitated in running Pathfinder. There was a huge number of options for each character class; the magic spells are not standardized and require the GM to study the spells (in addition to the characters' various powers), with all their mini rulesets, beforehand; some of the \\"stat blocks\\" for the monsters involve some extensive preparation... In particular, I was concerned that the players would be turned off or intimidated by the rules, since none of them I would describe yet as \\"hardcore\\" RPG players.<br /><br />But now, after having run my first session, I can now say the following. I can assure any person who is a committed GM (like myself), that the complexity is not a problem for players. The players only need to know some basics to play in a Pathfinder game - all the rules about flanking, limits on casting spells while adjacent to an opponent, etc., can all be introduced piece-by-piece as they become relevant throughout a given game. Every player is free to spend extra time between gaming sessions to get a copy of the Core Rulebook for themselves if they want to fully customize their character, know what other actions they can take, etc. Also, to the extent I have compared Pathfinder with the system it is based on (D&D 3.5 Edition), Pathfinder has made an effort to avoid unnecessary complexity and has streamlined certain rules. On my own end as the GM, I think I'll get to know the ins and outs of the rules and various spells in due time.<br /><br />Mind you, I had never even PLAYED a tabletop RPG before, and I am saying that the first session I RAN went (relatively!) smoothly. (I ran Crypt of the Everflame, which is a good introductory module for players and GMs.) However, this is not to suggest that learning how to run Pathfinder is easy - it takes quite a bit of preparation. However, if you are enthusiastic about the project to begin with, the process of preparing and looking forward to the experience you can give players should be a source of joy in itself. Also, many of the rules are derived from a \\"real-world logic,\\" and don't pose the challenge of memorizing a set of \\"gamey\\", suspended-in-midair rules from 4th Edition, such as enabling clerics to heal nearby allies by allowing them to \\"spend\\" one of THEIR OWN healing surges for free (unless of course those other players ran out of healing surges for that day), or that magic items can only be sold for 20% their purchasing value, or that wizards can unlock doors only by spending money and waiting 10 minutes... instances in the rules that seem to challenge my own internal effort to \\"keep the world together\\" for my players. (I want to avoid those moments of telling players \\"you can't do that\\" when there is little for me to say to back it up.)<br /><br />On a similar note, the \\"complexity\\" of the character classes was itself a big draw to the players. The sheer number of options for each character class got people's imaginations going. They especially enjoyed the \\"flavor\\" paragraphs that gave a broad, romantic overview of each character class and provided a context for each class's powers. And, of course, the variation among character classes is much wider than in D&D 4th Edition - not only does a Wizard indeed \\"feel\\" much different from a Fighter, but also a Fighter with her background of training in fighting skills (feats) \\"feels\\" different from another front-line bruiser, the Barbarian. And the amount of options WITHIN each character class, especially with the Advanced Player's Guide that has just been released, is thrilling.<br /><br />I have read people who prefer 4th Edition argue that the relatively smaller number of rules in 4e allows \\"more room\\" for roleplaying and imagination, but I honestly don't understand that argument. Any roleplaying system must have a set of rules, a set of confines that provide restrictions, IN ORDER for imagination to flourish. In order to \\"feel\\" like a parallel to our real-world experience, which DOES operate within restrictions, a fantasy world must have its own internally-consistent set of \\"laws.\\" Is this a world I can see myself living in? Then, it's the bending and breaking of the rules (by a wizard using magic, by the scrappy street urchins rising to become heroes of their realm, etc.) that makes fantasy into fantasy. Otherwise, what you have is a blank slate, and if you're a novice GM (like I am), it is a blank slate that will be drawn upon by a novice.<br /><br />The danger of \\"too many\\" rules, is having rules that provide an OBSTACLE to roleplaying. For example, one doesn't want to impose a mythology or an essentialism upon the setting or characters that provide restrictions to players' imagination (4th Edition's description that dwarves \\"revere Moradin\\" and \\"play a dwarf if you want to be tough\\" comes to mind). Of course, no one is bound to stick to everything in a given rule system, and the example I just mentioned can be dismissed and other problems in 4e can be \\"house ruled away.\\" I would just rather not have to do that work as a GM. And some \\"rules\\" and \\"complexity\\" can provide FUEL to imagination: a perusal of Pathfinder's character class descriptions, or spell descriptions, or wacky cursed items, give me inspiration for hundreds of possible traps and storylines.<br /><br />(As an aside, I am not sure I like Pathfinder's \\"skills\\" system - I want to roleplay a negotiation with a player and not involve a roll of the dice. At the same time, I see how that mechanic rewards a player who has chosen to be, say, a rogue who is highly skilled in this area. I'm not quite sure how to deal with that... but the way 4e deals with this is even more mechanical and worse.)<br /><br />So having \\"fewer\\" rules is not automatically better. And to be honest, that is a cop-out: it's the game designers whose job it is to supply the rules, and it's the players who supply the imagination. The question is whether the rules system, which is the responsibility of the game designers, provide starting-off points and inspiration to the imagination.<br /><br />Also, because Pathfinder is easily backward-compatible to the entire D&D 3.5 Edition's line of adventure modules (from WOTC and third-party publishers), there are many excellent adventures that are ready for me to use than there currently are for 4e.<br /><br />My last comment is about Pathfinder's new Advanced Player's Guide, which demonstrates a big reason why I chose Pathfinder over 4e: the business model. D&D's publisher, Wizards of the Coast, has created a product line that requires spending more and more money to stay up-to-date. They have just released \\"Player's Handbook 3,\\" and one who buys the first Player's Handbook simply doesn't have the current game and must buy more recent offerings: they purposely excluded the popular Druid and Monk classes so they could publish them in the 2nd and 3rd Player's Handbooks, respectively. (WOTC, by the way, is credited by some older fans of Magic The Gathering of having \\"broken\\" the game balance, because every new set of cards would include powers that \\"broke\\" strategic considerations from previous cardsets and required every player to buy new cardsets whenever they came out.) In contrast, Pathfinder's Advanced Player's Guide has hundreds of pages of archetypes for the core classes, alternative base classes, alternative racial traits, and more... all of which are optional. And, there is a genuine effort not to break the game balance and force customers to buy this book. (For example, all the optional new class powers are in exchange for class powers from the Core Rulebook.) Sure, they're still double-dipping and making me want to buy their shiny new book, but it's a very well-done book and one that I don't absolutely HAVE to buy.<br /><br />I simply don't get the feeling that Paizo, the publishers of Pathfinder, have sold their souls to Asmodeus. Their origins as being the writers and publishers for Dungeon magazine before they were booted by WOTC mean that, for now, they are relatively gamer-focused as a company. The quality of their Pathfinder Adventure Paths (6-part adventure modules) have given them a well-deserved reputation as being \\"by gamers, for gamers.\\" Oh, and sweeping the Ennies (the \\"Oscars\\" of the RPG world) this month and winning Gold for Best Game (Pathfinder RPG) and Best Publisher ain't bad, either. (Congratulations, Paizo: they're well-deserved.)<br /><br />So that's my two cents if you ask me: go with Pathfinder, and then go to the Paizo/Pathfinder messageboards, where you'll find a very supportive and enthusiastic gaming community you can join. :)rictions, IN ORDER for imagination to flourish.

B0002V7ODI|5.0|There's been quite a few comic book adaptations being done, although that I haven't read any of the comics before watching the movies.  Though that of the ones that I've seen some seem to be alright, good, and some I think are great without having any of the comics to know anything about the stuff prior to watching the movie.  While I have to say that some comic based movies like Spider Man, or even X-Men, I've come to enjoy watching them, then when I went about watching Hellboy, I found another one that I can go about enjoy watching without reading the comic.  I have to say that this movie reminds me of how the Spider Man movies were approached, but this movie feels darker than that of those movies and the writing seems to be just on par with those movies, maybe even better.<br /><br />When it comes to the use of CGI, in movies, there are some that I seen that know how to use it properly while others it don't turn out so good.  With Hellboy, they knew how to make good use of it and turns out rather good in the end.  As for the acting in the movie I felt that each of the actors done everything to give their characters the feel that they are in the comics.  With the 3-Disc set, I like all the special features that have been packed in this set, everything from the trailers & tv spots to even about a 2 ½ hour documentary on how the movie went about from the comics to the big screen.  Seeing that, I never realized how much stuff went about in the making of this movie and know that these movies aren't easy to make.  Overall I give it 5 stars out of 5.
B001D84NKQ|5.0|I saw the movie and was hooked on the song Bankrobber.  Not being a huge Clash fan, I looked at all the different CDs that song was on.  Listened to the clips of the songs on the CD and thought it sounded pretty good.  Turns out I was wrong, it is amazing.  This is a great CD for popping in on a long drive.  I love that it criss-crosses genres as well as entire generations of music.  Its also put in a proper order.  I highly recommend this CD.
B001F7MSFW|4.0|With the release of Hellboy II: The Golden Army, while it seems to be just on par with the first movie though that I don't think that this movie went about outdoing itself like some sequels try to go about doing.  I do have to say that this movie is better than I would think for a sequel to a really good action packed movie such as the first Hellboy movie and I feel that they done good in delivering a good sequel to it.  While the story itself doesn't follow where the first movie left off like some sequels tend to do, though the story is about the humans against elf/magic world at war.  Although it seems like that it was just a story that they told kids, but as it turns out it was as true as the people had said it was.<br /><br />Hellboy better known as `Red' throughout the movies, finds himself along with his friends in the midst of the battle that is about to come about once again and stop the `Prince Nuada' from starting this war once again.  On top of that `Red' and Liz are having a few issues to work out, not only that Abe falls for Princess Nuala, and the worst part is that she's tied in with her brother Nuada, meaning what happens to him happens to her as well.  Everything in this movie seems to be just as good as the first installment of the series, though the CGI was also just as good as the first if not maybe better than the first.  I don't think I really have any complaints towards the movie, that I feel that it could've been a bit better, but not by too much though. Some of the special feature are interesting view on the movie and add to what was brought to the table.  Although I don't like how the 3 Disc Special Edition, the 3rd disc was just a digital copy of the movie.  Overall I give it 4.5 stars out of 5.
B000F8O35U|1.0|I bought this, brand new,  for my niece's birthday. She was so excited, she opened it immediately to watch with all of the kids, but it was unplayable. Turns out there were huge scratches on the back. I e-mailed the seller with this dilemma, and asked of a return policy, and I still have not heard back from them. My first disappointing purchase from amazon.
0525423842|5.0|This is still a great read for an adult. Even though the main character is a teenager in high school,it is well brought off and I enjoyed reading it very much!
030726999X|5.0|The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo was awesome, a story that introduced us to the marvelous Lisbeth Salander.<br />The Girl Who Played with Fire gave us a view of Salanders past life and where she came from and why she is the way she is.<br />The Girl who Kicked the Hornets Nest begins right where the last book leaves off. The story takes off right away and does not disappoint. Larsson delivers so many twists and turns, just like the first 2 books, you can not put this book down.<br />The story is BRILLIANT and ties the first two books together so well that<br /><br />The Girl who Kicked the Hornets Nest focuses mainly on the trial and struggle of Lisbeth Salander.<br />She has been accused of many horrible murders and other disgusting acts.<br />Since she is a victim of corrupt government, proving her innocence will not be an easy task, and she needs lots of intelligent people to help her out. The way the story unfolds and twists is terrific and I highly reccommend reading this book after you read the first two!<br /><br />I would love to have read more stories about Salander and Blomkvist but I am happy I have these 3 to live with. I am satisfied with this being the final book, considering the author is no longer living.
0780785746|4.0|This novel is well written. One could sympathize for the main character. One could really get inside of his head to understand why he was the way he was and why he chose to do what he did. This was a decent book, and I would recommend it, but it was not my favorite.
B0031RAOVY|5.0|The video \\"Hachi:A Dog's Tale\\" is one of the most amazing and heart warming videos  I have seen in a long time. Richard Gere is at his best in this true story about a  man and his dog.  This movie effects viewers in an interesting way. The person I watched the video with  began calling every noble dog he saw, \\"Hachi\\". Very embarrassing but understandable.  Surprise ending for those who think they know how every movie is supposed to end.
B00127RAJY|4.0|20 minutes is 20 minutes.... While I wish there was a few minutes of warm up ... I can do 20 minutes of anything.  Yes, it is challenging and you will get a work out ( well, unless you are one of the super buffs-- quit bragging) and when i feel like quitting i can talk myself into sticking with it.  After 5 days it became much easier--- so just stick with it.
0060849827|5.0|This book is great! I bought it for my husband and he loves it. It really has everything you need to know for survival and great tips for camping. Don't let its small size fool you... There's a lot of great information packed in this little book.
B0035WTE2U|5.0|It's a great compilation of great AC/DC music of all times. A must have in the AC/DC collector's list. The iron man iconography helps to sales, but in this case is innecessary. It only makes sense because the songs are part of the film, but without it the disc would still be an excellent collection of tracks from AC / DC. Is true, it's a new compilation of old songs, but it is a very good selection of classic AC/DC songs, and not so classics like Cold Hearted Man but just as good!    The DVD has great performances, and for me the video of \\"Highway to Hell\\", recorded in Buenos Aires in las December is the perfect example of how all hard rock shows should be !! I was personally in that audience and it was a really striking good concert, and the video is not far behind.     I hope these comments will be helpful. Greetings from Uruguay !
B001NLKT60|5.0|I gave the Girl With The Dragon Tattoo 4 stars because it was a little slow to get started, but not this book.  I was hooked from the first page.  If you liked the first book at all... don't miss the second one.
1439153663|4.0|I have  high praise for this \\"slavery time \\" story.<br /><br />The author has effectively brought forth subjects --often \\"taboo\\" concerning white slavery , children fathered by slave owners ,mixed race slaves ,  slave rape and all of the baggage that goes with it.However in this case it is done with a hand of explanation , a hand of understanding of the situations of those involved ---mostly unwanted involvement.<br /><br />A plus for me is the intelligent and sensitive way this subject matter is handled by Ms. Grissom. Not in the offensive \\"Mandingo \\" method.....not in the \\"Bodice\\" ripper story line........ but in a way so that many people can read and understand exactly what was going on in those days and why !!<br /><br />She has taken great pains to try and  educate  the reader concerning the very complex relationships between slave and owner , black man and white man. White woman and slave woman.<br /><br />I appreciate and understand and acknowledge the style in which she has written this book........and do HIGHLY suggest it for reading...for older teens and up...even old persons will find this to be a very interesting book.<br /><br />I suppose that all books must have a downside somewhere.I would have to really pick to find it in this novel. So with said---let me say---that I would of only wished that the closing chapters were a little more drawn out than what they were.<br /><br />I was left wanting to know more about the characters in this novel --where they went and what they did for the remainder of life ! Thats how the author made you care about these characters.
B003A4IFGY|5.0|Tom Petty and the Heartbreakers continue to amaze. Mojo is their first studio work in years,and is well worth the wait. Petty and the band return to their southern-rock roots, heavily influenced by traditional blues motifs, in a terrific blast from the past made possible only by decades of playing together.<br /><br />I bought the CD before seeing Tom during this summer's tour, wanting to be familiar with the \\"new stuff\\" before I saw him in person. As it turns out, he's giving away free downloads of the CD with the price of the concert ticket (even so, I'm glad I bought the CD).<br /><br />For those of us of an earlier generation - who can recall the British invasion, and understand that it was groups from England which served to introduce white American teenagers to American blues - this CD is a reminder of how American bands took up the task of reinterpreting our own musical heritage, and built upon it.<br /><br />From a production standpoint, the CD is refreshingly \\"under produced\\" and gives the impression of a group of guys standing around some microphones and doing the songs in a single take. It has immediacy and life that are hard to find in other contemporary music.<br /><br />Great CD.
B003PX85GK|4.0|I havent stopped listening to it since i downloaded it a few days ago.  Very solid top to bottom.
B003DO13NS|5.0|Mike Oldfield has been called pretentious, egotistical, and similar uncomplimentary synonyms. I find his efforts unique, transformational, and highly creative.  His work, at its best, is a 20-21st century successor to the classical tradition, especially his long-form works.<br /><br />Hergest Ridge is a terrific example of his extraordinary compositional range, melding together elements of tone-poetry with rock, jazz, and orchestral influences. This is not as iconoclastic as Tubular Bells, and is more similar to Ommadawn in that it demands close attention to appreciate its much more subtle aspects.<br /><br />This particular work might be labled as \\"New Age\\" by some, but don't confuse Hergest Ridge with the background tunes at your local spa. Don't light candles and meditate to this music. Listen closely and appreciate real artistry at work - it's well worth the effort.
B000FGGE68|1.0|NOTE: This review contains a few spoilers<br /><br />I don't know where to begin, since there are so many things wrong in this movie. I'll start by saying what I DID like. There were some decent moments of music, and there were some nice-looking gadgets here and there. And.....that's it. The rest of Ultraviolet is pure trash from beginning to end. Here's why:<br /><br />-The CGI effects in this movie is appallingly bad. During about 90% percent of the time I was watching this movie, I was annoyed at how unrealistic the chase sequences, the buildings (both inside and outside), and the flying bullets looked. You can really tell when and where they used green screens and.<br /><br />-Every single character in this movie is never interesting and never intriguing. The kid character is a bore. The hemophage rebels are weak and completely forgettable. The main villain, a cardboard cutout at best, does not look dangerous in any way (one reason being a terrible casting choice). And finally, the hero named Violet is dull and unconvincing. Even when she feels conflicted, there is no real sense of dilemma that's conveyed onscreen. It seems more like a stupid excuse for plot progression.<br /><br />-Nearly everybody in the film does a horrid job at acting, especially Milla Jovovich as Violet & Sebastien Andrieu as Nerva. The sole exception is William Fichtner as Garth, who looks like he at least put some effort in his performance.<br /><br />-The dialogue is amazing, but in a very bad way. \\"You are all gonna die.\\" I'm sorry, what?<br /><br />-Why are the colors in this movie so bright and disjointed? I think I'm having Batman & Robin flashbacks!<br /><br />-The fight sequences are some of the worst that I have ever seen. It's completely tedious, because the main character (Violet) doesn't get hit even once by a bullet nor a sword. She doesn't even get hurt when she crashes into a high-rise building with her motorcycle. There is no real sense of jeopardy, which really ruins any opportunity to create any suspense. In the end, once you've seen how she deals with literally dozens of soldiers, you'll know exactly how the end fight between the hero and the villain turns out.<br /><br />-There are several plot twists in this film, and NONE of them are shocking. Why? Because by this time, there is absolutely nothing in the story that fascinates me in any way.<br /><br />-One of the most overused and most notorious plot points is used in this movie. I just hate it when characters are brought back from the dead: it's getting old and useless.<br /><br />In conclusion, this movie stinks. I couldn't really enjoy watching this mess. There are so many flaws in this movie that I lost count halfway through. It doesn't even pass as a guilty pleasure; that's how bad this movie is. Hard to believe that this cost about $30 Million to make. It should have been spent somewhere else.<br /><br />Grade: 2/10u've seen how she deals with literally dozens of soldiers, you'll know exactly how the end fight between the hero and the villain turns out.    -There are several plot twists in this film, and NONE of them are shocking.

B002ZG97RE|1.0|I'm so tired of high profile actors turning into political activists.  Make a movie and move on.  No one cares about your left wing propaganda or right wing propaganda ....if there is any right wing propaganda in the movies now days.  Bottom line...Matt you are not too big to fail and no one will bail you out if you do.
0792160347|4.0|This movie has grown on me over the years. The first time I saw it I was a teenager and at that time I really did not understand the movie. Now as an adult I can revele in the greatness of Paul Schrader's character, Julian Kaye. Simply put he is the kind of guy I've always admired. Confident, suave, intelligent and well-dressed. The man of the 1980s!    Some critics like Leonard Maltin have said that the movie is a bit too slow. Yet the slowness of pace allows us to get accustomed to the character and his lifestyle. Julian is a man who seems to have it all. Clothes, women a car a nice apartment. Yet despite all of the success he appears to have he is an extremely lonely man. Michelle Stratton, wife of a prominent politician, enters his life at the right time and they begin a torrid affair. Things get dicey for Julian when he is framed for murder and the story takes off from there.    I highly reccomend this movie and its similarity to later movies such as Light Sleeper (1992) and The Walker (2007) will be evident to any film buff. While I've seen Light Sleeper, I have yet to see The Walker; but I've heard it too is quite good.    American Gigolo, while somewhat dated today (See Julian's Tricks Get In Contact With Him Using 1970's Technology) still holds its own when it comes to dealing with the basic human emotions of love, lust, greed and envy and hatred. Bill Duke's role as Leon was fantastic. his ruthless portrayal of a gay pimp has yet to be matched by any other actor in any similar-themed film. I won't spoil the story for you, but I will say that this is a thoroughly enjoyable Four-Star film.      A. Nathaniel Wallace, Jr.
B002VECM6S|5.0|My wife force-fed me this one over the weekend even though I told her several times that I had no interest in seeing it.  I was pleasantly surprised, however, and was glad for the experience.  Sandra Bullock did a great job in the lead role of an upper middle-class white Memphis suburbanite who is confronted with her own prejudices and challenged to live out the Christian beliefs that she says she holds -- an absolutely charming character, very well portrayed.  What Michael Oher accomplished is nothing short of inspirational.  All he needed was a chance and some encouragement.  His story offers a rare glimpse at a brand of compassionate, race-transcending human decency that would benefit our society enormously if more of us could find it within ourselves to step out of our comfort zones to emulate this example.  I definitely recommend this movie, which is also very family friendly.
0345404475|5.0|I was very pleased with this whole transaction. The book arrived quickly and was as described. I would buy from this seller again. Thanks!
B0002IQNAG|5.0|I'll keep this short. If you like Dawn of the Dead or zombies or even horror films, this should be near the forefront of your collection! Buy it---buy NOW!! Seriously, if every horror film worth its salt was given this kind of attention, the world would be a better place (and I'd be glued to the TV more as well). This special edition D.O.T.D. has multiple versions---each of which have their merit (the European version mainly because you get more GOBLIN in the soundtrack). It is loaded with special features (documentaries, interviews, knick knacks, bric-a-brac, and more). If you want to know virtually all there is to know about D.O.T.D., this is the way to go. It s not very expensive at all and you get your money's worth AND THEN SOME. Truly, next to Argento's 3-disc \\"Suspiria\\" DVD release (in late '01), there's not a better treatment for a great horror film. So I say to you again---BUY IT NOW!!!!

B0039TD7PY|5.0|James Taylor and Carole King have such true and honest voices. I never get tired of listening to them.
B003H3IOLE|5.0|A friend recommended this novel since I enjoy historical fiction.  A Tree Grows in Brooklyn follows the path of a turn of the 20th century family in Brooklyn. Although Ms. Smith wrote the book in the 1940s, its message is timeless. The reader watches as the central character, Francie, grows up determined to have a better life for herself.  Francie is 2nd generation American who comes from a working class neighborhood of Brooklyn.      Francie adores her Irish father who does not have steady work and often comes home drunk.  Her father loves Francie dearly and encourages her to dream and to become a writer.  He even supports her efforts to go to a better school despite the distance the school is from their home.    Francie's mother, Katie, works hard and long as a housekeeper and keeps the family together.  Katie recognizes the value of education and reads to her children from the Bible and Shakespere nightly.  She also encourages their imagination.  When the family moved into a house with a piano, Katie had the children sit with her during lessons so that they all could learn to play since the family could hardly afford lessons for one.      Francie is very close to her brother, one year her junior, who is also pushed to achieve more than what the parents have been able to do.    While money is always tight, the family always has a roof over their heads and usually they have food.  Francie's maternal grandmother and aunts add to the moral fabric and are there to support the family when needed.      There is conflict between having the children work so that the family can survive vs. allowing them to focus on education.  Francie and her brother are able to do both, but the logic that Katie uses when forced to choose was not intuitive, but the right choice.      What I loved about the book is that it showed how the children grew up with very little material things.  Another message is to look at everything around you with the attitude as if it was the first or last time that you have seen such things.  Recognize beauty of which it beholds and you will live a much for fulfilled and hopeful life.   Sure, the children had conflicts with their parents, but in the end, they recognized how important their relationship was with each other and that having money didn't equate to having happiness.  It is a wonderful, timeless, coming of age story that should be required reading for today's youth.
B000TERDES|5.0|Just a couple of points to add, since everything that could be said about this masterpiece has already been said.  The rest of the band does not get the credit it deserves for this album.  You only have to look at Corgan's solo work to figure that out.  James Ida, carried his magical guitar work with him over to Perfect Circle and if you listen to him with that band, you'll hear a great deal of the unforgettable guitar work in Siamese Dream was all James.     The four of them were magic together while making this album and everything about every song feels absolutley perfect.

0307454541|4.0|The great beauty of this book is the immortal character of Lisbeth Salander. One gapes in astonisment. How the hell did Stieg Larsson conjure her up? It seems that Lisbeth Salander is timely, she fits perfectly this 90's new millineum zyber girl-power chick, and still she is utterly complex. It's funny with these kind of creations, like Lisbeth Salander, they take on a life of their own, far overshadowing their creator. So yes, Don Quixote, Chaplin's Tramp, James Bond, and... Lisbeth Salander!
B000AYEL6U|5.0|I have over 300 good films in my library, including many classics and mini-series.  I was not familiar with Elizabeth Gaskell's works, but bought \\"North & South\\" after reading the rave reviews here.  I was not disappointed.  This is one of the best \\"period pieces\\" I have ever seen, and one I'm never tired of watching.  The cast is wonderful, the cinematography is beautifully done, and the mood and atmosphere makes it so realistic.  With such varied tastes, there is rarely a film made that consistently gets 5 star reviews, but this one is worthy of it and much deserved.
B000FC1RCI|5.0|It's been about 15 years since I read this book, and I still remember it as one of my finest reads.
B000I5XDXS|5.0|Okay, I'm an oldie.  I remember when these guys first came out, I bought the LP.  Loved \\"Hold the Line\\", great high school anthem.  Anyway, except for \\"Africa\\" these guys might be unknown to a younger generation, but this concert provides a great introduction.  To someone who was a fan years ago this DVD confirms the reason for liking them.  The sound is exceptional, the colors are really vibrant and sharp, the crowd is energized.  At times you get the feeling the band is playing a small venue, with an almost jazz band impromptu performance on the medley songs, really good stuff.  The guys definitely show their age but the performances do not suffer. English Eyes and White Sister are superb on this Blu-Ray.  Buy this if you enjoyed Toto before, I'm sure you will not be disappointed.
B001GZ6QC4|3.0|This was a solid movie, but way too long. It was as if they kept putting in another scheme for the Joker to pull off...then another...then another. Why? They could have cut 30 minutes from the movie easily.     I have to say that I was expecting much more from Heath. While his performance was certainly solid, it was by no means the oscar winning portrayal I was hoping to see. And for him to have said that the role was so disturbing that it was causing insomnia and a lot of his problems--he clearly had some emotional issues then, because the Joker was actually a lot more tame that I thought he was going to be. All in all a solid movie, but it was too long and over-hyped.
B001GF7WRW|5.0|Great headphones. I really got a deal. Very neutral sound all around (don't expect booming base), but clear and crisp with great mids. Besides isolating most sound (despite being semi-open), they're also really light, have a long chord, a self-adjusting band, and look quite stylish. Get 'em.
B002ZG997C|5.0|I received the DVD the same week I ordered it. It was a brand new copy of the video in the original wrapping. Great service.
B000002O5L|5.0|A quaint example of 80s American heartland rock. Every chord of Mr. Petty's music swoons with a vulnerability that will leave listeners nostalgic for simpler times. A simply lovely LP.
B000MQC9H4|3.0|Cute, typical, predictable romantic comedy.  Enjoyed most of it, Cameron Diaz tends to be a little over the top, but other than that the characters are well played and lovable.  However, it appears the writers had no idea how to end it, so the ending makes absolutely no sense and is just a bunch of people dancing around.
B0007Y08PQ|5.0|This is my favorite Star Trek TNG movie.  It has everything--great special effects, great acting and a very good story line.

B00068ULLY|3.0|When I think about a box set I assume the DVDs come in a different type of packaging so that makes it different from all the other \\"regular\\" boxes. This item was just the two movies in their \\"regular\\" boxes wrapped in plastic. I got dissapointed because I expected something else. The dvds don't even have a different the cover or at least sometihng similar to the image shown above. It would have been the exact same thing as if I had purchased both movies from a store a couple of blocks from my house (even cheaper).

0545123283|5.0|Linger definitely satisfies as the second book in the coveted Wolves Of Mercy Falls series. It follows with the same amount of passion, intensity and gorgeous writing as Shiver, making it a second installment that I absolutely loved.<br /><br />Compared to the first book, Grace and Sam's romance is dropped a few levels. I think it took a backseat to unresolved conflict and the introduction of a new wolf, Cole, who turns out to be more than Sam bargained for. The action is scarce as well, but I didn't mind it all the much. I feel like we got such a large dose of it in the first book, that this is a nice break, since you know the third and final book, Forever, will be crazy intense.<br /><br />Grace's slow transformation practically broke my heart. Her despair but curiosity for the entire ordeal literally seeped off the pages. I don't think I've ever been so emotional about a sequel before, but Maggie did such a beautiful job with progressing the wolf inside of Grace right before our eyes.<br /><br />I wasn't too sure how I was going to feel about the additional POVs of Cole and Isabel, considering I wasn't too crazy about her character in Shiver. But I actually really enjoyed it. Their connection was a fresh break from Sam and Grace's soft romance, but all four of the characters worked really well together.<br /><br />Overall, I loved Linger. Though the romance and action is definitely toned down, this sequel will grab you and keep you hanging until the very, heartbreaking and tear-inducing, end. I definitely recommend this to any fans of the first book!
B001AQT11M|5.0|This movie is a classic from my childhood, and in true Disney form: never a disappointment!
B003CFBQBW|5.0|I bought this CD because i am a huge Twilight/books & movies fan. I have the other two soundtracks and listen to them while I work. This soundtrack however, is something I take with me everywhere. My kids love it, we listen to it in the car. I bring it to work with me and it is on repeat all day long. The best couple of bucks I have ever spent!
0446563048|4.0|\\"I do recommend this book, particularly for the business strategies/techniques Hsieh explains. I was disappointed with the autobiography portion of the book. It seemed to glistening, spotless and carefree. Tony didn't seem to go through any challenges and appeared to lead a very charmed life - no heartbreaking relationships, no bullies - nothing. It came off as unbelievable.<br /><br />As the book turned to the story of Zappos the balance between success and challenges took shape, such as the company's struggle to get funding, last minute negotiations, car crashes and shoes strewn across the highway. That's really compelling and interesting stuff.<br /><br />The biographical part of the book felt like the author was hiding something, or was uncomfortable with sharing the true story of his early life, warts and all. One exception was his adventure climbing Mount Kilimanjaro in Africa.<br /><br />That story was definitely compelling, but it was a mix of the author's life and Zappos overcoming a major challenge. I wonder why the author would even share anything about his background if he wasn't going to be transparent. I would have enjoyed the book just as much, if not more, if he just stuck with the story of building Zappos - from his graduation from Harvard to present day.\\"
B003AO1SVS|4.0|My first and favorite Black Keys album is Rubber Factory.  The raw, bluesy sound is what made me fall in love with their music and the fact that it was just Auerbach and Carney on their guitar and drums made it all the more impressive.  Brothers has a much more polished feel about it than their earlier work but the same great lyrics and fantastic guitar and drums are there along with some added keyboard and bass.  For the people to talk about this album in a way that it seems as if the Keys are selling out is absolutely ridiculous, the music is as great as ever, the only difference is that they can afford a nicer recording studio and are willing to let their music evolve.  Ten Cent Pistol, She's Long Gone, Next Girl, and Howlin' for You are just a few of the great tracks you'll find here and they're right up there with the best of the past ten years or so these guys have been giving us great music.  I for one also love the fact that with this new album is actually getting air time on the radio because even if you hate Brothers, the worst song on here is better than anything Ke$ha puts out.<br /><br />If you don't believe what's being said here why don't you go to a show and watch them play a classic like Set You Free from Thickfreakness and rock just as hard when they follow it up with She's Long Gone from Brothers.  If after that you still think that Brothers is a disgraceful release, I'd like to suggest the band Nickelback because they will surely put out an album that sounds exactly the same as all their others soon enough.
B003QNXPUK|2.0|I got the invisible shield and was excited to use it, however was quite disappointed afterwards. It's grippy on the screen, when i glide my fingertip on the touchscreen it feels like my fingertip is being tugged. Also, you can tell that there is a layer of plastic over your screen and it takes away a bit of the resolution. A lot of dust also cling onto it easily, which is annoying to brush off constantly. On top of all that, it slides and peels off after using it for a while. The only good thing i can say about it is that it gives you a good grip for the back side of your phone. Overall, i wouldn't recommend getting this screen protector. I peeled mine off and stuck on a high-quality Japanese-made screen protector, Momex - it looks and feels like you don't have a protector on your screen, and it does its job well. If i were you, i'd opt for a Japanese-made one.
B002VECM72|1.0|This movie is nothing but white folk patting themselves on the back for helping a \\"poor black kid\\" off the streets.  Never once does the movie give credit to Michael Oher for his amazing accomplishments.
B000000QFV|5.0|In my opinion, \\"TYR\\" is a classic album, Tony Martin has unique vocals and I like his style so much, I can say he is my fav Black Sabbath singer, another thing makes this album so special is \\"Cozy Powell\\" (R.I.P.) as already known back in the days, he used to play drums for Rainbow, Cozy was probably the best drummer in rock history! He is playing from heart in \\"TYR\\" and watch out the drum solo intro at \\"Heaven in Black\\" thats Cozy's classic signature! Well....the man, maybe the most important man behind the Black Sabbath is...Tony Lommi,He is a great guitarist and his style is unique as well as Tony Martin and Cozy Powell. In 1990s, metal was going down the hill,most metal bands were changing their sounds but \\"Black Sabbath\\" protected its sound with this album!,Neil Murray is on the bass and Geoff Nicholls is on the keyboards. As I finish my comment, \\"TYR\\" is a milestone in Black Sabbath's career and deserves attention.
0307474712|5.0|Well, I was convinced by Nick Hornby from his recommendation on the blog.  It is truly a fine piece of work.  While I admit that it tends to follow When Harry Met Sally in some ways, I don't think it really is a true comparison.  It's a lot more serious in tone, even if there's still enough humor to keep it light, but that made it all the more likeable.    What was really impressive was the handling of Dexter's character.  Yes, I've seen some one-starred reviews where they couldn't stand his misery and his laziness.  Having said that, though, he is human and he knows his own misery; therefore we see deep inside many emotions. He thought that he was on top of his game as a TV presenter, but then the tabloids start printing negative reviews before the first episode even airs, and gets heckled by his own audience.  It's tough to get out of the rut he's in, but he does eventually, and learns hope through his daughter.  It was a touching moment for me to read it, even as his whole world is crumbling.    I felt like as Dex and Em's relationship evolved over the twenty years, it was showing a huge part of growing up and maturity occurring on the part of both.  And sometimes that has to happen.  We don't realize how things have changed between when you are forty and when you are twenty, and David Nicholls shows how people change for the better, and that the memories of a love are both bitter and sweet.    I found out that the movie version of this may be released Fall 2011 and will star Anne Hathaway and Jim Sturgess.  Really looking forward to it.  I'm questioning why the movie won't be in an Americanized setting like \\"High Fidelity\\" though, since they do plan to distribute it here.  A transition from UK to an American city might rewrite the story in a different light, and get away from obscure British cultural references (even though I did understand them).  On the other hand, movies like \\"The Commitments\\" and \\"About A Boy\\" still win audiences, so I'm very confident aboutthe adaptation.

0316017922|4.0|So called \\"success-literature\\" is typically infested with charlatans, but Gladwell has produced an outstanding contribution to the general understanding of this subject with \\"Outliers\\". As there are already a plethora of reviews that cater to the this-is-kind-of-what's-in-the-book readers, i'm going to focus more on some of the philosophical irks and pleasures i received from reading this great book.     Gladwell, with understandable vagueness, posits that to build a better world we \\"need to replace the patchwork of lucky breaks and arbitrary advantages that today determine success\\". He essentially says that by removing such arbitrariness we might get \\"twice as many hockey stars\\" (or whatever the career may be). This of course is a logical error. The NHL, for instance, has finite spaces to fill. A \\"flowering of talent\\" achieved through a more efficient scouting system would not all of a sudden give us more hockey stars but it would however raise the level of the ones that were ultimately produced.     And this is the main criticism I have with his theory. There isn't enough on the competition factor intrinsic to human endeavor. If there were a million kids just like Bill Gates with the type of unique access to a computer that he had in 1968, would we have a million Microsofts? Of course not. We would definitely have had greater competition, but in the end, we would most likely be left with at most a handful of surviving companies. The quality of those companies however, all else being equal, would be of sterling standard and have excellent software due to the competition just mentioned. Just like the effect on a pro hockey league it wouldn't mean that the final sample size would be boosted significantly, it would just mean that the quality of that final sample would be greatly increased due to the increased competition during the preceding stages. The old adage still holds true: We can't all be rock stars. Much like an ecology, there is a self-enforcing balance thatprohibits over-exploitation in narrow niches of work and life.     Gladwell concludes by saying that if this or that chance had been extended to others (rather than being arbitrary) how many more would not have a better life?     More, but probably not as many as Gladwell thinks.     If opportunity is made universal, it ceases to be opportunity. Opportunity intrinsically means having the possibility to seize an advantage of some sort. Crucially, a lot of these outlier advantages are not about getting broad universal advantages that everyone in the sample gets, they are about getting advantages over your immediate surroundings in order to get ahead of them. In other words, opportunity is often competitive in nature because it typically depends on position from where you are most likely to get in touch with further opportunities.     With the now staggering amount of people in most societies in the world, this social climbing has become less about climbing over obstacles in front of abundance and more about making sure it's you rather than the next guy who gets subjected to the few but golden opportunities that exist. It's true that success isn't necessarily a zero sum game, but positions of influence can be. Consequently, maneuvering into a favorable position from where you are most likely to come in the way of opportunity will always matter. Getting into these most serendipitous positions will invariably have a competitive game theory aspect to it. It's basically hierarchy management. Nobody successful has become so without having some break or skill in their management of existing hierarchies. Nobody has truly been completely on the outside, trying to punch their way in, and succeeded wildly without being given some form of break outside their control. It just goes to show the importance of the advantages you are given, how they matter in trying to reach the position from which you can take a stab at the big time, provided you come sufficiently prepared.    And regarding that last remark i do come to agreement with Gladwell as he explains, in wonderful writing, just how important such \\"breaks\\" can be. Unlike Gladwell however, I am less convinced of the possibility for meaningful predictability in this area.     In the grander scheme of things regarding success, we have less control than we would like to think, but at least we have some control. If this book teaches us anything it is to know how much lies outside our hands but to prepare ourselves dutifully for those windows of opportunity that arise once or a few times during a lifetime, often having an extremely disproportionate role in our overall success.      The stars and the Bill Gates' of the world are the ones for whom things have lined up incredibly well. For the vast,vast majority however, life is not like that. It is a rough and tumble existence of varying doses of luck and unluck, of opportunity taken and opportunity missed. Very few have the luck, the background, the IQ, the practical intelligence, the support network, the surrounding environment and the timing to make it to wild and complete success without anyone of them proving to be a devastating snag on the way.     Also, one might add, none of those reaching wild success knew exactly what they were doing either. Bill Gates was just a kid who knew he liked computers. Jerry Seinfeld just knew he liked comedy and wanted to do it as much as possible. It just so happens that the surrounding environment and their timing was perfect and the world asked for their services in a big way. I'm sure somewhere there was a kid with a similar passion for toasters who didn't make any millions despite him spending ten thousand hours fiddling with them.     It's not to the individual's credit when the stars line up in the best possible way and neither should one ever expect them to do so. It is rather, most appropriately, to be regarded as a gift.   And on that last note, I once again agree with Gladwell.
B002JVWRAO|5.0|I absolutely love this show!!  I can't wait for the dvd release so i can go back and watch this season all over again from the beginning.  I am a little worried about where they're going to go with it next.  Eric Kripke originally saw this as a five season show and the final episode for this season would have been a perfect series finale.  I'm certainly not going to complain about having more supernatural, I just hope that season 6 holds up to the rest of them.  I really hope they bring back Death!  Could that guy have been any more creepy?

B0031RAOVY|4.0|First there are probably few people visiting Amazon that knew the real \\"hero\\", Hachi, or how he lived day to day in Japan at the time of the original event.  The movie centers around loyalty and that was the beginning and the end... Parker's son indicates that fact and so does Parker's friend, Ken. Attachment and loyalty and relationship with Hachi and \\"one\\" person are the keys to understanding the movie. Indeed, Parker's daughter finally grasps that fact in a key moment of the film and opens the gate... some folks are reading way to much into the film, the events and the responses of some characters. To them, well, there's more to life than the polished Hollywood effort to bring to film a human interest story from 1920's and 30s. If you cry to hard to cannot watch it, well... visit a third world nation and see how they treat their pets.  Given what the film was portraying, given the limits of a film 'about' a non-speaking hero and the time lapse between then and now this film does a fine job of presenting the issue of compassion, loyalty and Hachi.
B001CVCB9O|5.0|From the fertile cross-cultural soil of the American Southwest, John Convertino and Joey Burns have grown this smart, understated symphony, possibly their best album yet.  Fifteen tracks, including three instrumentals, one Spanish-language song, and unbilled appearances by Sam Beam (of Iron & Wine) and Pieta Brown (Greg's daughter).  It carries you like a river, and deposits you cleansed at the far end.    Though this album does little to surprise Calexico fans, the sound seems more spare and muscular than it has in the past.  Most tracks have six to eight musicians and intricate arrangements, but Calexico's appropriation of Latino, rockabilly, and indie rock sound austere, like something heard from a great distance.  I can't help remember all the prophets and artists who felt most at home in the desert.    The lyrics shuffle across images like a hungry kitten, not something to understand so much as to experience.  Ironic juxtapositions and abstract images yield up their secrets only when you listen enough to spot patterns.  \\"Cell phone trees\\" and \\"fractured air\\" resonate more with poets like Emily Dickinson and Wallace Stevens than conventional songwriters.  Think of it as a singalong for smart people.    And the music dances across genres, from Sun Records blues to hot jazz jams to border ballads.  This band refuses to be pinned down, outmaneuvering every attempt to fit them into easy categories.  Sadly, this is probably what keeps them from the mainstream success they so richly deserve, but for listeners who prefer edginess to polish, authenticity to panache, this album feeds a need that pop artists overlook.    Time and again, I wonder why so few artists make music that challenges me, makes me think, and urges me to be a better, brighter person.  I pull out my hair in frustration.  Then, just as I prepare to give up hope, an album like this one jumps out and reminds me that true artists still cut albums full of vision and heart.  Calexico redeems my hope in human art.
0061122416|1.0|This book is quite a painful and tedious read; I only finished it because I had a promise to keep. Great many times I was about to stop, but somehow I was foolishly hoping to get to some glorifying, summarizing final redemption. Not a chance. From its very beginning it feels unfocused, vague, messy, sloppy and lost in its own search for meaning. A journey populated with eclectic characters who do not seem to understand their own purpose yet alone significance, a hero who seems to undergo quantum leaps from his shepherd origin to a treasure finder...Kafka claimed a book should be an axe for the frozen sea within us, but this one hardly qualifies as a straw stalk.

015603283X|4.0|This book was simply a lark to read for me.  All this to-ing and fro-ing in the other reviews about whether this book is for \\"intellectuals\\" or not seems to me deliciously absurd icing on the cake of this very funny book.  It certainly helps to be well-read, but I rather doubt one has to be a card-carrying \\"Intellectual\\" to enjoy this book.<br /><br />So, yes, lots of demonology, literary allusions and word play--some quite subtle, in this mystery/comedy/random caper that the reader doesn't have to understand in toto to fancy the book.  My favourite scene - which had me laughing so hard I was losing my breath - was an example of male impotence compared, in detail, to Napoleon's defeat at Waterloo.<br /><br />But, right, I'm straightening myself up and ceasing to laugh in order to concede that, yes, there are slightly deeper themes here, or one particular deeper theme: The non-reader's creed that Corso remembers Nikon asseverating:<br /><br />\\"Because I'm part of the rest of the world and I'm glad I am.  Films are for everyone, collective, generous, with children cheering when the cavalry arrives.  They're even better on TV: two can watch and comment.  But your books are selfish.  Solitary.  ......... A person who's interested only in books doesn't need other people, and that frightens me.\\"<br /><br />Indeed.  Any inveterate reader will be sadly familiar with this plaint on the lips of a lover about to abscond.  I know I am.
0545123283|3.0|If you've ever read a review or critique on Maggie Stiefvater or her previous books you will recognize and come to expect certain key terms like lyrical, passionate, poetic, creative and talented.  All of these descriptions ring true for Stiefvater and her writing.  After reading and enjoying Shiver I had high expectations for Linger and I was not disappointed.  Stiefvater took the love story between Sam and Grace and if it's even possible made it more dramatic and heart wrenching.  You are constantly rooting for them and crossing your fingers that they will finally get the happy ending that they so greatly deserve.  But rather than stop there (because apparently Stiefvater wanted to torture readers more) we are presented with a new character Cole, and a new connection between he and Isabel.<br /><br />Cole and Isabel are both going through a difficult time and I enjoyed watching them go through that together (not in a mean way or anything).  It was like they recognized something in each other and knew they could lean on one another.  I was a little disappointed that at times in the book we got more information on these two than on Sam and Grace, but at the same time it was like an added bonus.  We got two more characters to root for and care about, and another couple to hope for.  Overall I think Cole and Isabel added to the greatness that is the Wolves of Mercy Falls series, but I know some readers will want nothing but Sam and Grace and who can blame them?<br /><br />I'm not sure I have a favorite when comparing Shiver and Linger but I'm upset that I have to wait a year for Forever to be released, that's just too long.  All in all I think Stiefvater has another success on her hands and an overall fan pleaser.
B001IBIHQ4|1.0|Tom Hanks and Spielberg let down the vets. Too bad Steven Ambrose was not alive to help Hanks and Spielberg interpret WW II in the Pacific. Hanks/Spielberg apparently believe it was their sacred duty to show all the dirty deeds, some real and some probably invented, of the marines in the Pacific. There were some extraordinary acts of valor depicted in the battle scenes, but mostly I got the impression that I was watching a World War II movie through the prism of a 21st century anti-war pseudo intellectual Hollywood elitist. The difference was that Captain Winters and his men were around to provide guidance and direction and realism to the Band of Brother mini-series. The Pacific was based on three different eyewitness memoirs but no living vets. Hugh Ambrose served as a consultant but he lacks the skills or integrity of his father.   This was not a racist war as Hank's so famously announced. It was a brutal war of survival where marines and corpsmen had to make some terrible life or death decisions in defense of America. Band of Brothers was outstanding. The Pacific was well...very disappointing. I'll never buy it.

B0036TGSR6|3.0|It is perhaps because of the fervency with which I was looking forward to this movie that I am now declare disappointment with Ghost Writer.<br /><br />Who would blame me? There are quite a few recommending features: good actors, an interesting mystery and a good director who raises the viewer's interest level right out of the gate: an empty car on a ferry and a body washes up on grey, storming beach!<br /><br />Who? Why? How? These questions are raised but tantalizingly go unanswered as we watch Ewan McGregor's reluctance for taking up a new job, which only heightens the effect: what's going on with ex-British PM Brosnan and why did the ghost writer before McGregor (whose character--McGregor's--interestingly, is never actually named) die under mysterious circumstances and will history be repeated?<br /><br />The wind-swept island setting in which The Ghost (as McGregor is called) ends up is gorgeously somber, enhancing the general foreboding atmosphere as the tale weaves in and out, throwing various clues that leads the viewer seemingly everywhere but at the truth, punctuated by events that effectively shake up the picture. Unfortunately, the truth is where this movie falters.<br /><br />Unlike my wife and much to my dismay, I'm never good at predicting the end of movies, but this one's was particularly easy from about two-thirds of the way in and it's pathetic. Unfortunately, it seems in his zeal to paint UK-US relationships with the master-slave brush, Polanski stumbles over what could have been a truly intense story and grabs this pale reflection instead.<br /><br />Three stars for the gorgeous scenery, the wonderful beach house and the great acting (with the exception of the unfortunate Kim Cattrall).
B002VPE1B6|1.0|This could have easily been a five star movie, great concept except the whole story line seemed to be the director/writer's personal ideology. It was so over reaching in made me sick. The special effects and scenery are great, the techs that did that are the ones to be commended for this movie, James Cameron could have been left behind and they could have got a director/writer who could keep personal ideology to himself, now that would have made a five star movie.      Hollywood, keep your moronic ideology to yourself.      The director obviously believes in mother earth, and globalism, wait let us not forget the buzz word they like to throw around \\"sustainability\\", that may sound good on the surface until you find out who decides how to implement it and find out sustainability means nothing to them, they simply wish to have control over others. It is that type of thinking that requires no thinking. Where in the hell do they think their ability to sustain themselves comes from? They think it is the government and the fact is the government produces zero, it consumes/taxes, people who work and produce products other then entertainment are the ones that put food on their plates.     The good news is this movie shows what is possible with today's special effects and maybe we can get better movies out there using the same technology.
0545123283|4.0|This is the second book in the Wolves of Mercy Falls series by Stiefvater.  The third (and final) book Forever is due out in July 2011.  This was a good follow-up to the first book and fans of the first should find nothing to complain about with this book.<br /><br />In this book we start where we left off in the last book.  Sam is cured, but now Grace is starting to have trouble with fevers and feeling ill.  Isabel (whose brother Jack died while she was trying to cure him in the last book) spends a ton of time with Grace.  Also some new wolves enter into the story; meet Cole St. Claire, a sexy guy with a mysterious past who seems all about causing trouble.<br /><br />I will say off the bat that I thought [[ASIN:0545123275 Shiver]] was creative and easy to read, but slow.  The same holds true for this book.  Stiefvater takes a very creative approach to werewolves and that creativity continues some in this book.  We actually get involved in a bit of science behind the werewolf craziness and I liked that. I kind of missed having the temperatures listed at the beginning of each chapter, but they weren't as important since Sam is cured.  The characters are very likable and complex and the dialogue is easy to read.  There is just something about this book that draws you forward, I think it is mostly the question of Grace's illness and the threat of Cole.<br /><br />I have some of the same complaints with this book that I had with the last book.  It is slow.  Not a ton happens throughout the book.  Like in Shiver, we plod through the character's day to day life and very slowly the plot unfolds.  There actually isn't a ton of plot to unfold, but somehow it still manages to be engaging.  When I finished the book and thought back to what actually happened, really it wasn't all that much.  Somehow Stiefvater makes it work for her though and adds in some beautiful prose that almost makes up for the lack of plot.<br /><br />I also have to mention that I love that this takes place in my home state of Minnesota.  Stiefvater does an excellent job of getting a feel for spring in Minnesota and the excitement that comes with the rising temperature.<br /><br />Overall this was a good continuation of the series.  I found it engaging and easy to read, but still thought it moved a bit slow and wished that the plot was a bit more complex.  I eagerly await the conclusion to the series Forever..

0446679089|5.0|Taut, suspenseful and very entertaining.  Demille creates a clever storyline that rings of a modern day Agatha Christie who-dunnit.<br /><br />The setting:  a quaint Long Island sound village, rich in local history and lore of pirates and buried treasure.  Nearby is Plum Island, home to an animal diseases research facility operated by the Department of Agriculture but rumored to be a front for a top secret governmental site for biological warfare development.<br /><br />The murder:  Tom and Judy Gordon, lead researchers on Plum Island are murdered in broad daylight, at their home on their backyard dock soon after returning home from work aboard their high speed jet boat.  Initially puzzled over the brazen murder, investigators soon learn that an ice chest is missing from their boat and it is speculated that the couple were dealing deadly microbes on the black market.<br /><br />The characters:  protagonist and narrator of the story, NYPD Homicide detective John Corey is convalescing at his uncle's home in the village when he is asked by the local sheriff to consult on the case.  Unfortunately, Corey never met an authority figure he ever liked.  Dry witted, sarcastic and yet boyishly charming, he quickly ingratiates himself with the FBI, the CIA, the State Police and the local sheriff who are all working the case.  However, he knew the Gordon's personally and finds it hard to believe the merchants of death theory. But when it is discovered that the outwardly conservative Gordon's were secretly living well beyond their means, Corey sets out to uncover who the Gordon's really were.  Crossing paths with several possible suspects, all of whom are colorful characters, Corey find himself second guessing everyone while juggling romantic interests with a local research historian and the lead investigator in the case.<br /><br />Plum Island is a fun read full of adventures and plot turns.  Demille artfully crafts a good mystery and melds together a lot of what appears to be well researched material surrounding medical mystery, contagious germs, police procedure and historical information surrounding legendary pirate Captain Kidd.<br /><br />If you like Nelson Demille, this is a must read.

0061245097|5.0|Gah... This was just all kinds of ways good, the question here is why did I leave the delicious and uber sexy Bones sitting on my TBR shelf for so long? I mean I already knew this was going to be great, I figured Cat was going to kick some major butt and I'd heard all kinds of rumours about the infamous chapter 32, So why the wait?? I just don't have an answer. Anyways I loved this second part in the Night Huntress series.<br /><br />So where to begin? How about awesome, exciting, erotic, hilarious, bloody, sigh-worthy, movie-worthy, clever, romantic, thrilling, passionate, vengeful, intense, emotional, surprising, freakin fantastic and ultimately addictive. One Foot In The Grave gave me everything I could possibly want in a paranormal romance and then some.<br /><br />Half Vampire Cat Crawfield is now working for an underground section of the government. She and her team help rid the world of those bad rogue Vampires. You know the ones that use humans as hors d'oeuvres.  When we begin Cat hasn't seen her beloved Bones in 4 years although she's still using everything he taught her, still quick with a dagger and still slaying readers with witty one-liners.<br /><br />One of the great parts of this book is the anticipation the reader feels waiting and wondering when and just how they're going to get back together. And I will admit I was surprised at seeing this softer broken side of Cat that still pined for Bones (who wouldn't) Ultimately their reunion is everything you'd hope for; violent, romantic, hilarious and very sexy. (It also left me craving a Gin) Bones is once more unwavering in his love for Cat, luscious to listen to and retains his title as my ultimate literary boyfriend.<br /><br />With Bones back in her life Cat now has some explaining to do. Like why is he still alive?  There are more pressing issues to deal with though and with her team \\"merely\\" human the only one able to protect her from the master Vampire who's targeted her for assassination is Bones. All Cat's got to do is train and keep her team alive, deal with that pesky hit man, do full contact Pilates with Bone's ex and kill her father. All without losing Bones again in the process.<br /><br /> So as you've guessed I loved this and although I'm not one for the tough action heroines Cat in a brawl with the bodies piling up is just too awesome and that last battle with the 7ft Grendel is something else. My only complaint here would have to be Cat's mother and her continued arguments with Bones which both annoyed and bored me. However we're given a bunch of fabulous new secondary characters to drool over, who I hope to continue getting to know as the series continues. In particular the newly transformed Dave (although I adored the entire team) and a couple of charming new Vamps. And I promise I won't keep Bones on the shelf for another year. Cheersand keep her team alive, deal with that pesky hit man, do full contact Pilates with Bone's ex and kill her father. All without losing Bones again in the process.

B003HLM2QO|4.0|Again, I was fearful of an album without Zakk at guitar, but Ozzy does well at finding guitarist, and the album Scream does well with 29 y.o. Gus G.  Randy Rhodes, Jake E. Lee, Zakk Wylde, Joe Holmes on tour in past, and now Gus G.  Honestly, this album isn't that ground breaking as far as sound or guitarwork. I don't see Gus G. as a wizard or magical as Randy or Zakk in their time with ozzy, but he is an excellent guitarist.  I think the next step will be to see if he goes on to another album or two with ozzy or solo and see what his own work will be.  I think this album at this point could have been played by Zakk or Gus, or any good guitarist in this genre.  The album is similar to black rain in its heaviness and pace of songs, and seems very formulated to the last album. No real ground breaking music. That said, I liked Black Rain and felt it was an excellent return to form for ozzy who had a couple of down albums with his Down to earth, Live at buddakon, and the box set prince of darkness, which just didn't see great.  This album is heavy and will get you banging your head in no time.  Must have for Ozzy fans, but not really shaking up the charts as far as a new fan base or groudbreaking material.
B000PMLFRA|5.0|[...]<br /><br />Not pleased about only having the 1997 \\"Special Edition\\" films on the blu-ray, nor am I excited about the \\"previously unseen footage\\"(considering past additions and changes to the films,) but it's a step in the right direction.<br /><br />We should probably give up all hope that Lucas will alter his films back to their original forms...  His head is too large to imagine that he was in the wrong for changing the films, and essentially changing the character that we all fell in love with, the devious cold-blooded-killer Han Solo.<br /><br />At any rate, it's finally happening.  Now we can only hope the price won't be above [...].

B0021L8V0M|4.0|Director Philip Noyce and star Angelina Jolie, the pair who gave us a thriller \\"The Bone Collector\\" back in 1999, team up again for \\"Salt,\\" action thriller about Evelyn Salt, a CIA agent on the run, accused of being a Russian spy. To make my review short and not to spoil anything about the film, I can only say is that the fast-paced and action-packed thriller, penned by Kurt Wimmer (\\"The Recruit\\"), keeps you guessing until the end, though you may notice lots of plot holes when you leave the theater, or even before.    This is not to say the film is bad. \\"Salt\\" delivers goods with Angelina Jolie as the titular character, who remains a mystery from the very start (the film begins with a sequence set in North Korea, slightly reminiscent of one James Bond film). In fact some parts of the film remind us of James Bond or Jason Bourne films, but Jolie lends energy (if not credibility) to the convoluted storyline, which looks sometimes dated with the heroine's back story and these inevitable \\"villains.\\" Or maybe we should call it old-fashioned.    \\"Salt\\" is mindless fun with lots of actions. The action set-pieces including chases and shoot-outs are all well-done though some of them stretch credibility to the point where Salt looks almost superhuman (never afraid of ricocheting bullets). But Bond and Bourne are also superhuman, so why not Evelyn Salt?

B0036EH3XE|4.0|I've discovered by reading these threads that there is an innate sense of disappointment and abandonment from the fans, both new and old, regarding the last three seasons of LOST.  Like any film or tv show, or piece of artwork that makes the watcher question their own sense of being and self worth, LOST isn't going to be for everyone.  If you're looking to shut your brain down for a while, go watch an actionflick.  LOST is a journey and for those of us who still enjoy the show, even after it is gone, it will remain one.  I don't regret watching over 100 hours of TV at their original times every week.  I don't regret it because I enjoyed the anticipation of finding out what happened next.  Of course questions were left unanswered, people.  Do you really think we ever get all the answers to life?  I found myself crying like a baby during the last episode because I had grown up with these characters for 6 seasons.    Truly, that is something that a lot of people who are just discovering LOST are having issues with.  The immediate gratification of knowing what happens the next week within seconds makes us lose a little bit of that anticipation that comes with a show like this.  Do I think Season 6 was a little weak?  Yes I do.  But do I think that it was a colossal waste of time, like every person with a 1 star comment does?  Of course not.  Season 6 is a perfect bookend to Season 1, and it goes without saying that you need need need to purchase the entire series to appreciate it.  LOST is one of those shows that you need to watch from beginning to end, without any outside bias.    As a quick comment to those haters of the show, I'd like to point out a few things.  1. Guys, LOST was made to raise questions, not give you the answers up front.  You need to earn those.  If you haters complain about how the writers were \\"con-men\\" then congratulations, you've just been conned.  I felt that it was worth it.  2. I'll admit, some questions weren't answered.  Sure, there are some pieces of the puzzle (Ben and Whitmore) that weren't really answered.  Sure, there are some points that got thrown on the side of the road, but be adults and deal with it.  Brush them off and move on.  3. No guys, they were not dead for the entire series.  Anyone who thinks that definitely didn't watch the show or \\"get it\\".  4.  By \\"get it\\" I mean actually emotionally invest in the show.  If you were watching this show for answers, instead of watching it to simply enjoy the journey, then you've missed the point.      All in all: Season 6 as a whole.    4 STARS  PROS: The ending, of course.  One of the best ensemble casts of all time.  Bizarre timeline switcheroos.  Seeing some old friends.  Hurley one liners.    CONS: This season doesn't hold up on its own.  You need to see the entire series to appreciate it.      Comment away.

0307454541|5.0|After so many reviews, positive and negative, what can I add? A different point of view. I think it's important to read a few 5-star and 1-star reviews, noting the difference in perception styles.<br /><br />If you, in general, tend to be analytical and patient, sifting and weighing alternative interpretations, accustomed to complexity but not loving it for its own sake, I think you'll love this novel for its near-real-time nuanced observations and speculations. Since my life path has taken me through academic, investigative, journalistic and business-executive roles, I fit in this first category because I think it reflects real life in the analytical, investigative world where one must become aware of perhaps dozens of potential paths of pursuit, avoiding settling too soon on enticing but mistaken ones. In the real world, in other words, one cannot simply \\"get to the point\\" because one doesn't yet know what the point will be, who the \\"bad guy\\" will be. This novel braves the potentially risky (with some readers) path of thinking out, rethinking, comparing and contrasting, mulling and chewing, speculating, lots of potentially fruitful paths, or simply interesting ones, trying not to leave stones unturned while doing the time-consuming footwork that real-world investigators of all sorts (even or maybe especially medical investigators) routinely do. I think this aspect of the novel is what most consistently frustrates and even pisses off the one-star reviewers, and since I'm not an inherently patient kind of guy myself I really do understand their frustration. But again, real-world and real-time investigation demands lots of this kind of slogging through piles of documents and lots of dead-end interviews, etc., toward eventual progress. This process Larsson handles outstandingly, even astonishingly, well.<br /><br />If, on the other hand, you tend toward impatience with multi-faceted examination and analysis, deliberate weighing and testing of alternatives, you may well find this novel somewhat tedious, as do the 1-star reviewers you'll see here. In short, this is not Dan Brown or Robert Parker or Agatha Christie or even Sara Paretski, all excellent in their own styles. This is, instead, the real world wherein investigative reporters get up in the morning and examine numerous people and potential leads before deciding which ones will bear fruit.<br /><br />If you have patience for real-life investigation and multi-faceted characters that require time in various contexts in order to reveal their complex selves, if you enjoy a complex tale interwoven in fascinating ways, never rhetorically presented (which can be erroneously interpreted as \\"not well written\\" -- this novel has no literary flourishes), then I can hardly recommend this novel highly enough.el somewhat tedious, as do the 1-star reviewers you'll see here.

Due to the fact that it's the 75th anniversary of the Hunger Games this Hunger Games is different from the others.  All who have been in the Hunger Games and won are back in for the drawing.  Katniss is the only female from District twelve so she has no choice but to participate in the games.  Back at home things are bad, too.  Many of the districts are rebelling against Panem.

It was ok and scary up until the point that they showed the monster or thing and then it became cheesy. i mean wow DONT NOT I REPEAT DO NOT WATCH THIS HORRIBLE MOVIE. Seems like it was written and directed by a [...] 12yr old. Some parts are disturbing at best. but it was very very predictable and insanely cheesy. I got angry really angry watching this movie the sister was a bitch and the old black woman should have died. The acting was amateur hour. Horrible acting 101. i really wish i could get the 2 hours back that i spent watching this movie.  DONT  NOT  WATCH  THIS  CHEESY  STUPID  MOVIE.  Im embarrassed to have even watched it and write about it but i feel the general public should know how bad its is and to destroy every copy you see. if you like this movie then your even more [...] up in the head than the people who made it! it deserves 0 stars but thats not an option.

B001G8NW6Y|5.0|Sure, a few of the specific examples cited 60+ years ago are no longer relevant today, but the basic lessons are absolutely and permanently valid and need more than ever to be understood by at least a majority of the voting public.    The sad fact is that Americans can go through the entire public school system and \\"higher education\\" without learning the first thing about economic science (while getting bombarded with self-serving economic propaganda).  Thus public gullibility to the fallacies cited by Hazlitt seems no less pervasive now than back then, while the resultant cancerous growth of government economic meddling has only increased.    Here's a revolutionary fantasy:  Make this book a required study by all high school students.  Imagine what that would do for the kinds of politicians who get elected in the future.    BTW, you can get the nice hard-cover edition at less cost directly from the Mises Institute.

1597801585|5.0|This science fiction novel, set in the not too distant future, has as its backdrop an environmentally ravaged, highly dystopian Thailand.  In this future, biogenetics have run wild, unleashing a plague of viruses and biological scourges, leading to worldwide famine and a breakdown in societies.  Carbon based fuels have run their course and energy is largely based upon power generated by human beings and beasts of burden (for example, treadle powered computers).<br /><br />In this world, generators and distributors of nourishment hold all the power (calorie companies).  Biogenetics is key to developing new food strains that are resistant to the many plagues that have destroyed most of the known crop sources.<br /><br />This novel bears a striking resemblance to Ian Macdonald's River of Gods, though I found this to be quite a bit easier and more enjoyable to follow.  Both feature a dystopian society set in a third world environment (Macdonald in India).  Where River of Gods foresaw a society rich in technology, particularly in the area of bioengineered life forms, the society in The Windup Girl has virtually collapsed.  Any technology found in this novel is in the bioengineering needed to ensure an adequate and safe food supply.<br /><br />As power sources have largely disappeared, and nourishment is dangerously scarce, the balance between the energy necessary to physically produce power, and the energy available from the scarce food supply is the key to survival.  As a result, the calorie is largely the measure of wealth and power.<br /><br />The characters in the novel are rich and well developed.  The \\"calorie company\\" agent, the windup girl (an archaic, cr&egrave;che grown life form), the yellow card man (Chinese refugee), the Dung King (think Master Blaster from Thunderdome) all play pivotal roles within the framework of the story.  Particularly interesting is the tension and conflict present between the Thai kingdom's ministries of Environment and Trade.  In the face of worldwide epidemics and famine, the Environmental ministry (the white shirts) held absolute sway and were rabid and uncompromising in their isolation and protection of the Thai sovereignty.  Now, however, international trade has reemerged and the moneyed interests have begun to reopen the borders to immigration and the import of potentially dangerous goods and food stuffs.<br /><br />This is a fantastic novel.  It is highly original in its vision of what environmental degradation and unrestricted bio-engineering could bring in the near future, without being overly \\"preachy\\" or pedantic.  It simply provides the resulting landscape, peoples it with fascinating characters and tells an engaging story.  Highly recommended.amine, the Environmental ministry (the white shirts) held absolute sway and were rabid and uncompromising in their isolation and protection of the Thai sovereignty.

B0025KVLTM|5.0|Sgt. Pepper's Lonely Hearts Club Band is truly a masterpiece, a seminal piece of work that, after forty-three years, has lost none of its magic. As a native of Liverpool, England, I can honestly say that the only way this album could have been improved upon was if a revamped version of the majestic Penny Lane/Strawberry Fields (both of which capture with amazing accuracy the vibe of these places in Liverpool, and that only true Scousers, as the Beatles were, could articulate) had been included. Sgt. Pepper's Lonely Hearts Club Band illustrates succinctly the geniuses and visionaries the Beatles were. Definitely the greatest album of all time.
B003LXM1RS|5.0|It's been four long years since the Scissor Sisters released \\"Ta Dah,\\" and they certainly have been missed. Apparently they were working on an album for 18 months, but then decided to scrap it, feeling it wasn't up to snuff. However, the four year wait has certainly proved to be worth it. \\"Night Work\\" is their best album so far. It's darker, yet more energetic than their first two albums. They bring a dark sexiness to this album which is exciting and very interesting. There is a definite gay sensibility to the album, more so than on \\"Tah Dah.\\"  What I mean by that is, so much of the album celebrates gay male sexuality. I won't reprint the lyrics here, just listen for yourself. That's just another thing I love about it. The decision to work with Stuart Price, who co-produced Madonna's stellar 2005 album \\"Confessions On A Dance Floor,\\" was an inspired choice. The album is a real winner.    And then there's the album cover. It's very um...\\"cheeky.\\" I feel that the album cover is the perfect cherry on top of a terrific record. This album is definitely worth the price, buy it!    1. Night Work: A great song to kick off the album. I love this song, it's fantastic. (5/5)    2. Whole New Way: I love the fun and sexiness of this song. It's great. (5/5)    3. Fire With Fire: This is the first single. It's not really my favorite song, but it is very good. Jake Shears is in top vocal form here. (4.5/5)    4. Any Which Way: Another really fun song. How could I not love a song that contains the lyric: \\"I'm gonna find me a man the right shade of bottle tan, a man that smells like cocoa butter and cash.\\" Ana Matronic's delivery of that lyric is especially fun. (5/5)    5. Harder You Get: This song is nice and somewhat explicit, if you really listen to it. I love it. (5/5)    6. Running Out: This is a good song, not my favorite though. (4/5)    7. Something Like This: Good song, with a really nice beat. Not bad. (4/5)    8. Skin This Cat: A nice sexy song, and Ana Matronic once again nails the vocals. (5/5)    9. Skin Tight: I really like this song, it's really well done. (4.5/5)    10. Sex And Violence: I love this song, it fantastic. (5/5)    11. Nightlife: Another song that's very good, but not a favorite of mine. (4/5)    12. Invisible Light: I freaking love this song! Jake Shears' vocals are simply fantastic, and this is just such a fun dance song. Also, the choice to have Sir Ian McKellan do the vocals for the spoken part of the song was genius. It really ups the fun, gay campiness quality of the song. I can't help it, I love it! (5/5)    Overall: 4.66/5
B003ELOQCK|5.0|I was at the concert just before this at Sam Boyd Stadium in Las Vegas. U2 is wonderful live, and this brought back some of that excitement for me. I do agree with other reviews that some of the camera work is so quick you barely have time to focus before it jumps to the next scene. As the shows continues, it does seem to improve though. I sat and watched this grinning like an idiot, singing away with Bono and the Edge. And the stage is really something to be seen- you just cannot describe it to someone. The shots from above the stadium really show how impressive it is- but be ready to hit the pause button, it is another quick shot. It took me ten years to get tickets, and so I want to be able to re-live this concert until the next time.

0399156577|2.0|That is the true mystery! Does she even write her books anymore, or does she have the same plot outline plugged into her computer and have ghost writers fill in the blanks? At least James Patterson gives credit to his \\"partners\\". I have read all of Roberts' books and can truly say this is one of the worst. The main characters were completely unlikeable. Fiona is whiny and demandingly independent to the point of stupidity. Simon is just plain hateful and abusive. The relationship is troubling. The sex borders on violent and the lovers push, shove and use abusive language towards each other.I am used to a certain amount of profanity from Roberts but she set a new record with this one. Much of the dialouge consists of the f-word. Even the dogs use it. The only reson this book get a two star from me is because of the dogs. They are much more entertaining and interesting than the people.  I recently read that Roberts' book sales are down and that she no longer appears on the Forbes list of the year's top earning authors. Considering how dissapointing her last few books have been, this comes as no surprise.
B002VECM6S|5.0|This is an excellent film with a message needed for today. We do not need collective government programs to help anybody. We need what this film portrays. Christians living for God and caring for their neighbours. The person God places in your path to help. Whatever it takes! That is what a real Christian does. NOT the Government. So stop complaining and get out of your comfort zone and sacrifice for someone else. Believe me it is what we are alive for in this present age.

After finishing this book I booked a flight to Haiti, found myself a Voodoo priestesses and placed a hex on you, your agent, and your publisher! Prepare yourself; I suspect you'll be experiencing some otherworldly discomfort shortly.     This was fluffy, incoherent nonsense that I will use only when I have a desire to puke. I'm ashamed of everyone here who gave this book more than two stars. If there weren't so many of you I would have added you all to the hex.
0439023483|5.0|Suzanne Collins has created a world inside of The Hunger Games that may soon not be too far from our own...at least in terms of choice of entertainment. Like a previous reader has mentioned, this story is very brutal, but very engaging. The reader sees the world through Katniss Everdeen's eyes-- for better, or for worse-- and struggles along with her in the Games. Throughout all the brutality, though, I was captured by Katniss' awakening from lone survivor to rebel with a cause.     Of course, the end of the book was not satisfying because I hungered for more, and the entire book brought on questions. What really happened in the rebellion so long ago? What will happen to the victors of the Games, etc.    I think that if you purchase this book, you won't be disappointed.
B002RVZV9U|4.0|It Might Get Loud is an interesting mish mash of three different generations of guitarists and what inspired them.  Jimmy Page (Led Zeppelin), The Edge (U2), and Jack White (The White Stripes, The Raconteurs) take you on a trip down memory lane and explain their approach to guitar playing, along with some interesting stories of what influenced them as kids.  It's a good documentary as a whole, but there are times when it seems a bit self-indulgent.<br /><br />I guess the main point of the documentary is how guitar playing has evolved over the decades and how it's still relevant today.  It would seem that Jimmy represented the 60's and 70's, while The Edge represented the 80's and 90's.  I assume Jack White represented the 00's and whatever is to come.  What is very clear is the passion these three men have for the art form.  Through archival footage and interviews we get to see these guys in ways most probably haven't seen before.  I was intrigued by some of the old TV footage of Jimmy Page when he was in his early teens.  It was really interesting watching these three guys jam together and sort of get off on each others riffs.  I particularly enjoyed the trio's rendition of \\"The Weight.\\"<br /><br />There are times, however, when the film feels a bit disjointed.  The structure of the film is rather arbitrary, jumping from one guitarist's story to another's and then back again.  Most of the film is these guys just talking about what they like.  They do play occasionally, but I found that those segments were cut too short.  Some of the archival footage is of them playing live, and just when they get really rockin' they cut to more interviews.  What a bunch of teases.<br /><br />Self-indulgence aside, if you like documentaries about music you will likely find something to enjoy in It Might Get Loud.  The blu-ray version of the film looks and sounds excellent.
0596805888|5.0|Cooking is chemistry. With maybe a little physics thrown in on the side. You know, temperature control, stuff like that.    You may think you don't like to cook. Too boring, too restrictive, you have to follow the recipe - or else. If so, this book is for you. It answer questions that most cook books don't think about asking. And if you have any curiosity about why recipes turn out like they do, and are interested in experimenting, using a knowledge of chemistry and physics to improve your dishes, this is a great book. It includes interviews with fellow geeks who explain why and how they prepare favorite dishes, including one with the publisher, Tim O'Reilly. Each interview adds something to the final mix.    Although there is some organization to the book, like most cook books, it can be opened to any page, and you'll likely find something interesting to peruse. It is not put together as a textbook on cooking, more as a smorgasbord. Some of the more basic elements of cooking are covered in the early chapters, but the science is available in side bars and short essays throughout the book.    Other reviews have listed the books table of contents, I won't repeat them. Suffice it to say, if you enjoy experimenting, using the scientific method in your cooking, if your curiosity isn't satisfied by just following a recipe time after time, if you like to know the \\"why\\" as well as \\"how,\\" you'll enjoy this book. Would also make a great gift for that nerdy son/daughter newly living on their own. Highly recommended.
6305161992|5.0|I have never been a fan of Dolph Lundgren, in fact the only movie i have seen him in that i really enjoyed his performance was Universal Soldier. Anyways Lundgren was a little bit enjoyable in this movie. He seems to always walk around with this \\"i big bad and no one can take me down\\" attitude. But he seem to work great with Brandon Lee. Now i Love Brandon Lee huge fan of his and honestly Lee was the reason i got this movie. I loved the way that Lee played the wise-ass cop he pulls that off to good and he gaves so funny moments to the film. i enjoyed this movie and i think that if you are a Lundgren fan or a Brandon Lee fan then you will enjoy this movie. or if you are a fan a action movies, mainly the late '80s early '90s action movies then you would enjoy it as well.<br />I just wish the dvd had some special features

B000059XUP|2.0|I love the first Crow starring THE LATE GREAT BRANDON LEE that movie was beyond amazing, i have seen the 3rd crow Nah on that one, and i couldnt even finsh the crow wicked prayer. and i couldnt remember watching this crow (now i know why because it's not meant to be remember) but since i couldnt remember it i got it. if i could go back in time and do it again i would not buy it. the movie style wasnt right, the crow makeup looked stupid (maybe it's just b/c the actor couldn't pull it off). the cast was crappy. the story was along the line of the first crow the only diff it was a son and father not lovers. the good thing about this is that after the crow city of angels i was able to grab my crow dvd starring the late great brandon lee and watched it. the look, coustumes, style, cast, acting of the first movie was beyond amazing while in this one NO along with 3 and 4 NO.   my advice stick to the oringnal and best and only crow (at least for me) The Crow starring brandon lee. the sequals can't hold anything to it this movie falls down down down below the crow not even near the same class of the crow.
B00006690G|5.0|While `Recovery' may be his comeback (and it's quite a comeback), `The Eminem Show' is clearly the last `great' album Eminem dropped.  From thought provoking yet playful lyrics to slick beats that lace his determined delivery, this album has rarely a dull moment.  Sure, it contains one of his single worst songs (`Drips'), but it also contains a slew of his best.<br /><br />The album opens with a string of strength, starting with `White America'.  The song is targeted at, but not limited to, the political embarrassments that surrounded our country around the time the album was dropped.  With a fiery delivery that shows true passion for his themes, Eminem defies the stigma that surrounds the genre and shows that he has logical teeth behind his words (he's shown that before, but it's always nice to be reminded).  `Business' follows with a funky beat that gives Eminem a nice backdrop for his clownish lyrics.  It's not the best track on the album, and it's certainly not the best of Eminem's playful tracks, but it kind of gets everything right.  `Cleanin' Out My Closet' brings us back to a more serious place, delivering one of Eminem's best tracks to date.  Eminem takes us back to his childhood and uncovers more about his turbulent relationship with his mother.  The picture he paints is grim, yet it is lathered with pure style.  `Square Dance' jumps back to a more playful tone (yet it certainly retains a more serious edge with its lyrical content) and it does so flawlessly.  This one has always been one of my favorites on the album.  The beat is sick and the rhymes are tightly structured around the infectious beat.<br /><br />And then you have `Soldier', which is like one of the best rap songs of the decade.  The track is perfect, containing one of the best beats on the album and the way Eminem struts his swagger, slinging verbal assaults like it was dirt in your eye; it just all screams authentic angst which helps sell this as one of the more poignant tracks on the album.  The anger here is perfectly situated to elevate the track into something so dark it feels raw and real.  Unlike the times when Eminem tries to make his murderistic (yes I made that word up for this review) rampages seem playful or humorous, Eminem shrugs humor to the side and delivers something unlike him yet completely comfortable.<br /><br />He's far more than just a one-trick pony.<br /><br />Reminiscent of his previous releases, there is that one track that became his first single and gathered him boatloads of attention once again; this time it was `Without Me'.  The track is hilarious and fun and certainly in line with `The Real Slim Shady' and `My Name Is'.  I actually prefer `Superman', which is a hilarious parody of all those ridiculously perverse love songs that circulate the airwaves.<br /><br />The later half of the album contains a few tracks that really deserve to be singled out.  `Sing for the Moment' is one of Eminem's better tracks to use samples.  The Aerosmith sampling is perfectly suited for the song and it elevates Eminem's message.  `When the Music Stops' is insanely fierce from start to finish.  `Till I Collapse' is also very strong, and Nate Dogg's chorus lines give the song an almost vintage feel.  I love his voice and the way he lends a touch of class to every track he inhabits.  `My Dad's Gone Crazy' is a great way to close out the album.  Having Hallie on the track seems a tad odd, especially when you consider the things he says in this song, but it's a playful song that is slathered with humor, so don't take this track too seriously.<br /><br />It's just fun.<br /><br />`Say Goodbye to Hollywood' and `Hallie's Song' have their moments, but they don't quite get it completely.  Still, they are nice additions and don't feel like filler here.  In fact, the only track I didn't really care for (outside of the abomination that was `Drips') was `Say What U Say', Eminem's collaboration with Dr. Dre.  It just lacks the real spark that comes fromShady's music.  It felt like a rejected Dre track, not a refurbished Eminem track.<br /><br />Alas, the album as a whole is close to genius.  He proves here that despite his vulgar use of words deemed inappropriate, he cannot be defined by his controversial take on life.  By toning himself down here, Eminem shows us that there is a great deal of talent behind those offensive slurs, developing an album reflective of where he was in his rise to fame.  I love that he is back in the game, and I can't wait to see where he goes now.  If he can top this album then we'll be looking at one of the greatest rappers to ever set foot in the game, but then again, I think he's already achieved that title.ot a refurbished Eminem track.

B00006FDCD|5.0|I love this movie. Tim Curry really brought Pennywise the Clown to life, he had everything: he was scary and funny. The young actors the played the kids were all great the brought they characters to life and did they adult actors well. they cast the story and everything in this movie was perfect. if you are afraid of clowns then this movie is something that you dont need to watch. stephen king fans this movie is great. this movie while not all like the book does the book justice. i love this movie and i think that lots of people would enjoy this movie.

This is definitely a must have for any fan of ATLA b/c it gives you lots of background information about the series such as how did the creators created character like Toph, how did they come up with the awesome sword fighting scene, the beautiful landscape for each nation, etc...    I read this book five times already and still find new things each time that I open the book!

I actually liked Cusack the best in this film..showed the better part of his acting capabilities, but was not a great choice for Freeman who didn't really fit well with this the movie.  Idea of film was good but the writing an production lacked hugely which is why the film only got 3 stars from me.  Would recommend this film to be watched only via rental.
1433502399|5.0|I have only one negative thing to say about this bible - the print and especially the copious footnotes which are integral to the reading experience - is very very small.  I guess the book would be huge or have to be in multiple volumes to accomodate a larger font.  That one complaint stated, I love this bible and find it to be very illuminating.  I have only ready 3 books of it so far, but the contextual footnotes explain everything in what appears to be an independent and fair way.  There are so many sentences that I would have not understood but after reading these footnotes (which are on the same page as the original text) I understand it better.  I highly recommend this and if I could only have one bible this would be it.

0393072231|5.0|You didn't have to be smart to see that the American residential real estate market was going to crash. Every time my real estate adviser would tell me her latest horror story, I would say, \\"I could make a lot of money if I could figure out how to short this.\\"    And, of course, if I could get the timing pretty close. But I wasn't smart enough. \\"The Big Short\\" is about seven men who were smart enough, although it wasn't easy.    The first to spot the opportunity, according to Michael Lewis, was Mike Burry, a lone wolf whose attack turned out to be subprime in two ways:     First, he used default insurance, but he did not realize that he didn't have to troll the lowest tranches of the BBB loans to lock in profits when the crash came, so he overpaid for his bet. Second, he told his Scion Capital investors it would take two years (the time needed to allow the teaser rates on the lousy loans to reset) to cash in, and so many were unwilling to wait that long that nearly half bailed out, forcing him to sell his good bets before they were quite ripe.    At FrontPoint, Steve Eisman had the benefit of advice from his partners, more capital and made a much bigger score.    At Cornwall Capital, Charlie Ledley, Jamie Mai and Ben Hockett pursued a different analysis, came to the same conclusions and also scored big.    Lewis almost doesn't mention John Paulson, who got the most publicity for leading his fund to a huge profit, although since \\"The Big Short\\" came out in January, news has appeared that Paulson made his money the old-fashioned way: He cheated, by picking loans certain to tank and then having his unindicted co-conspirator, Goldman Sachs, sell them without mentioning that the idea was to lose money. Some people say that's OK on Wall Street, but usually people don't make investments with the intention of losing their money.    Lewis barely mentions Paulson, although a passing reference suggests, ambiguously, that he was aware that Paulson was selling downer cattle. Ifhe knew and didn't reveal it, he scooped himself.    The funny thing is, Paulson didn't have to cheat. As Lewis repeats over and over, the problem for the bears was not to identify the bad bonds - all of them were bad - but to find suckers to cover their bets.    The first sucker was AIG Financial Products, but the morons there eventually caught on. Not in time to prevent the world's biggest insurance company from failing, but at least to quit taking on more ticking bombs. Not to worry, though. Over at Morgan Stanley, a star trader named Howie Hubler came in late, but not too late to bet $16 billion of his company's money that the bonds were good.     Hubler lost (at least) $9 billion, the biggest loss in the history of financial trades and was punished by . . . oh, wait, he wasn't punished. He retired with several tens of millions of dollars.    We hear a lot of blather from the advocates of unregulated markets about risks and rewards, but that isn't how the market works. It does not punish the dopes. And this market was unregulated, no matter what you may have heard. Lewis never has to mention the Community Reinvestment Act or Rep. Barney Frank, although he has bad things to say about the Securities and Exchange Commission (under the control at the time of people who did not believe in regulation) and the ratings agencies, Moody's and Standard & Poor.    Much is made by the bears who talked to Lewis (who did not include Paulson) about how stupid the raters were, but there is no evidence here that they were any stupider than the hotshots at the big investment banks. On the very credible evidence presented here (and corroborated elsewhere), it is obvious that the chance of finding an intelligent person in the financial markets was less than one in a million. Some people made more money and some less, but the correlation between money (and esteem) and brains was negative 1.0.    At the end of the book, Lewis ruminates about morality, money and regulation. He is a wonderful storyteller but not so good a moralist. Anyhow,  it isn't necessary to reinvent the wheel. The Glass-Steagall Act prevented the sort of crash we endured in 2008 for 60 years, the longest period in the history of markets without a crash. (The previous longest was 22 years.)    Glass-Steagall was a dead letter by the time it was repealed in 1999. It should have been amended to cover the new types of financial instruments - the ones that Lewis made his reputation on with the book \\"Liar's Poker\\" -- but it wasn't.
B003A9OVS0|3.0|Gorillaz often pen some classic tunes, but those on Plastic Beach are tucked away on what turns out to be a bloated record. With too many 'Feat.' appearances and no real flow to the album, treasures like 'On Melancholy Hill' and 'Superfast Jellyfish' are somewhat lost in the mire.<br /><br />As a release to add a few new cuts to your 'Best of Gorillaz' playlist, this album serves some purpose. Unfortunately getting through the whole outing is more of a chore than it should be, making the case for those that argue in favour of regular singles releases in place of full records. Though I'm not one of those people, LP's like Plastic Beach make a convincing case for the prosecution.

B003X73QA8|4.0|Although The Suburbs has some pedestrian moments, it's a grower and the highs ultimately win out.<br /><br />Beautiful moments such as Rococo, Half Light II, and City With No Children overshadow the songs that warrant less attention, weaving a reflection on the album title that encourages more digging. Once you're in, the lyrics are often poignantly moving, keeping the return value high.<br /><br />Their third album lacks the overall coherence of debut Funeral, as well as its immediate rush of adrenaline, but there's more than enough to push it in front of Neon Bible as a recommended purchase.
B000BW7QWW|5.0|If you liked Firefly you may love this movie or you may not love this movie.  I loved Firefly and I loved this movie.  My recommendation, watch Firefly first and then watch the movie.  My husband was a Firefly fan and I was skeptical because I'm not a huge sci-fi lover, but both Firefly and Serenity were awesome!  Great story!  Really artistic! Great characters! Great acting!  I really loved both! Again, buy Firefly first and watch the series...then by Serenity.  You'll be glad you did!
0399156577|3.0|I have read most all of Nora Roberts, but this book was a little too long and too much of everyday normalcy. When I read, I like something to take my mind from everyday life. The story line was good. I just felt that she had to put all the dog training and Fiona's personal life to fill the pages. I still enjoyed the book, just my opinion that it could have been condensed. I will read her books again, because they are usualy very entertaining.
B000PDYVVG|4.0|I found this book to be a breath of fresh air.  There are so many women out there that just get married and have kids because it is what society expects from them or what they have been taught will make them happy.  The truth is every girl should be taught that there are many roads to happiness.  All girls should learn how to love, trust and respect themselves which are the basic three steps to becoming a woman.  Finally, the only person we can control and change is ourselves so if we are not happy we have the right to do something about it.  Overall these are the three messages I think this book is really trying to transmit.    It is important to point out that it's never too late to learn to love, trust and respect yourself. It is never too late to take control of your life and change. Finally, you don't have to go to Italy, India and Bali to do it.

B0017YWG2S|5.0|Tom Jobim and Elis Regina must have had a great time recording this. On the first and most famous track, \\"Aquras De Marco,\\" you can here Elis breaking up laughing and it takes her a few lines to regain her stance. It works, setting the intimate tone for this album<br /><br />After hearing Jobim's 1960s A&M albums like [[ASIN:B000002G6J Wave]], with scant vocals and heavy orchestration, the contrast here is a treat. Jobim sings--it gives you the feeling you are right next to him, not listening to the arrangements of composer--and overall, these tracks feature a small band; establish an immediacy albums like Wave don't.<br /><br />Not everything is light as a feather: listen to the dark strings on \\"Carcovado.\\" But a lot of the tracks maintain a breezy small group nuance that make this album so endearing. Either way, Regina's voice is perfect. You can here the passion in the music, in how Jobim arranges around her soft, pristine vocal lines.<br /><br />Tom and Elis have a little party. Come.

This is like a magnificent cross between Dave Carter / Tracy Grammer, U2 and, as somebody noted above, Fleet Foxes. Oddly enough the foot stomping seems eclectic rather than backwoods. Keep it up lads. Keep it as real as this one. And thank you.

0385528752|3.0|Switch. A book about how to change things when change is hard. Chip Heath & Dan Heath have tried to give a direction on how change can be brought about.<br /><br />Most of us would agree that change is difficult. It's a human tendency to avoid change as much as possible - be it as small as tweaking the way you communicate or bring about a change in some process or policy or when you get married and go to a new home. However, it's also true that change is inevitable. Chip & Dan have give three main points to follow - Direct the Rider, Motivate the Elephant, & Shape the Path. Rider is our rational mind & Elephant is our feelings. Chip & Dan have explained how by directing the rational mind, motivating a person to change and finally, shaping a path can bring about change. They also give in multiple examples of how people brought about a change by following the above steps.<br /><br />How helpful? Well, yes it did tell me what can be done to bring about change. In this way it was definitely helpful. However, it'll be only after I apply these points in real life can I say whether it's helpful in real life too.<br /><br />Rating = 3/5

B003OF3R0S|5.0|Not being a fan of the first album - my experience of Avenged only comes from Waking the Fallen onwards.   However, even from the metalcore sound from which they originated, they have explored music far more than bands do today.   Far, far away from any mainstream or stereotype, Avenged are unique and present music that contains blending music and lyrics that don't just address death or violence - as a metal band they have visited politics, religion, war and the deeper sides of emotions.     So, it is on this base of experience that they release Nightmare.   Most albums have one or two exceptional songs, and the rest average - this album is completely consistent with amazingly high quality material. Listened to from front to back, it develops smoothly and at no point does anything seem out of place. At some points it is an absolute rock behemoth, at others an acoustic emotional song, and goes on to abstract feelings about life.   The band commented that they evaluated every note to make sure the record was perfect, and it is clearly the best work the band has done. Fully living up to expectations, the record is indescribable in its greatness. Shadows & company have lyrically expanded a distinct length since the last record, and the overall sound of the record is one of maturity and a reflective look on life.   Obviously, this has in part been due to the death of the Rev, but it has given the band a purpose and a desire to make this record in his memory.     To conclude - the album beyond an 'essential part of your collection!'   The music connects with the mind on a higher level and is an essential part of your emotional experience
B000U1ZV8K|1.0|High speed car chases in city traffic, without regard to innocent civilians.  Spectacular wrecks with passengers walking away without a scratch or so much as a limp.  Multiple explosions, one of which blows a toilet into the street, without its occupant.  Ugly fights that barely leave a scratch on the participants.  Wholesale slaughter by gunfire.  That about sums it up.  There's nothing remotely entertaining to a rational viewer.    And I can't watch Mel Gibson without remembering his anti-Jewish rants or his threats to a girlfriend, as reported in the media.  I sat through two of the films, and I can't take another.

B001OQCV2E|5.0|The movie and acting were awesome. Special effects were almost beyond belief and surpassed even the mighty Spielberg's best efforts. The ending was not well thought out and I found it hard to swallow that people not familiar with the arc's construction within seconds of their death would have taken the time to fix the ramp and thusly saved thousands of living beings out of their feelings of humanity.  The rest of the movie was well worth watching. You will become a fan of this movie once you have seen it..
B001GZ6QEC|1.0|I truly hated this movie. It has no soul. It revels in violence and the most gut-wrenching cruelty without offering a single ray of hope. What is the point? Heath Ledger's performance as the Joker is superb - but it is easy to see how it could leave a person deeply disturbed. I have no problem with violent movies - Tarantino, Peckinpah, no problem. But those directors' movies, despite their extremes of violence, still have some sort of human center. The Dark Knight doesn't.
B000MRAAJM|3.0|I live in U.S. but I bought this Blu-ray set from Amazon.co.uk and paid less than $30 including shipping. So it was a better deal. From what I read in the reviews, there are two BBC Blu-ray versions, both were narrated by David Attenborough. One version contains four discs. The other contains five discs. The version I bought from Amazon.co.uk contains five discs. The last disc includes two topics: Desert Lion and Snow Leopard. Each is about 40 minutes or so.  However, both BBC Blu-ray versions are missing the behind scene/special features included in the DVD version. This is a big disappointment.  What's more, this series was shot with a lower grade HD specification - 1080i (also known as 720p) instead of 1080p.  1080p was mistakenly printed on the covers of earlier boxes but this error was later fixed. All the boxes now have the correct format (1080i) listed. Whoever said that 1080i (720p) is visually undetectable compared to 1080p either has eye problem or is using a small TV.  On a 40\\" or larger TV, 720i is noticeably grainier than 1080p.  Compare \\"Planet Earth\\" with the new BBC series \\"Life\\" which was shot in 1080p, the difference is quite obvious.    Overall, this BBC production is fantastic, like many of the other series they did. If I am rating the DVD version (which I also own), I will give it five stars. But for the Blu-ray version, I have to cut it by two stars for its missing the special features and using the lower grade HD format.
B003INBOEM|3.0|The HD quality of this blu-ray is not nearly as good as many other current blu-rays. It is very grainy and the blacks are not as dark as they should be. Still a fantastic movie, but this blu-ray version is not as good as I hoped it would be.

It gives the impression that the whole idea of this book has been based on a planned and calculated project, for it comes across like it could have been an arrangement with the publisher: In general, it is no secret that most Americans go to Italy for food, to India in search for spiritual enlightenment, and to Bali for love affairs; Nothing mysterious and deep about that.    However, portraying a planned designer book project as a series of unanticipated and blessed events and fortunate experiences with serendipitous people?? The impression that this book gives is so not inspiring. One can only reflects how unoriginal and convenient for a journalist it must have been to take off for one year and divide the time almost proportionately in these places to write a premeditated script.   Sometimes I feel that we Americans are so gullible and such an amazingly profitable target for book publishers!!    Sincerely,    Veracity, Washington, D.C.

B0000AQS0F|3.0|I bought this mainly because so many people seemed to like it, and because Nathan Fillion is in it, whom I love in the tv show \\"Castle\\".  Firefly is a good show, but I am not a devoted fan like many of those who have given reviews.  I really think they take all the character study stuff too far.  It is a show, period, and I do not think it is any where as good as Buffy or Bab 5. My lower rating is very probably due to the fact that I do not like Westerns.  Not in clothes, books, tv, movies or music.  Westerns leave me cold, and this is all about westerns.  I had hoped the Sci-fi side would be the most dominate, but it is really not.  Even the costuming is heavily western.  So, while it is an interesting show, if you don't like westerns, you will probably not be able to call it great.  As far as I'm concerned, this is just another western that uses a space ship in place of a wagon.  Disappointing.  It gets the middle rating of 3 stars because the characters are fun, if not as deep as some reviews would lead you to believe.  :)  If you are not a Westerns fan, approach with caution.
193413712X|4.0|I quite honestly can't say why I give this book 4 stars. I'm not a book reviewer, all I am is somebody who reads a lot for enjoyment. I read all sorts of genres, almost all fiction. When I stop and think about it this book really had a mundane story line, but the use of the English language just captivated me.  My litmus test for all works of art, be it sculpture, paintings, or books, is whether or not I took enjoyment from it. This book passes that test even though I can't say why.
0470601787|5.0|I`ve been a David Sibbet fan for many years. You are hereby forewarned that what follows is hopelessly biased. That said, brotherly love only goes so far. If this book were crap, I`d find a way to say so. But blessedly, and predictably, this book is way off scale in the other direction.     This is a fully useful manual of David's years of facilitation creativity in a form that is immediately accessible. If you are looking for a set of tools to make an insanely great improvement in your thinking and meeting chops, here you are. If you want some philosophical food for thought about understanding, perception, communication, design, teamwork and awareness, just keep reading. If you want to get beyond the dreary clutches of way too many powerpoint bullets, or you want to do something with a projected image that transcends PP, David's got a practice for you. If you really believe you can't draw, David will gently disabuse you of that notion and have you making intelligent marks in the first few pages.     Get a pad of paper and some pens and get reading and doodling. Then watch what happens at the first meeting you go to. After the first thirty pages of getting inspired, I tried some graphic notes on my iPad at the last film festival board meeting. Had a lot of fun, kept me awake, and then at the end the secretary asked to include them with her scribblings. Next week I take on a meeting of my own to facilitate and I'm trying the iPad trick on a projector, mixed with some pre prepared drawings as well. If nothing else, and there is much else, David delivers a dose of high flying courage to us shy people. David is one of the most courageous guys I know. And it comes through the pages nicely.     David and his book get five stars. It's always a privilege to spend time with him in whatever form. Please don't miss this chance.
0307474712|3.0|An easy read, good for summer. As has been noted the novel follows 2 people through 20 years on the same day - July 15th - each year. Emma develops well as a character, Dexter does not. Parts were trite and tedious, particularly Dexter's drug use and downward spiral, neither of which is given much thought or explanation; a convenient plot device, especially towards the end of the book where it just doesn't work. While I didn't necessarily want or think that the book should have had the perverbial happy ending, the ending it does have is trite and not particularly satisfactory. It's as if the author had nothing else for the characters to do or say to each other, or perhaps just got tired of the characters and couldn't figure out how to end, and so dispatches with one of them. I wanted to like Dex and Em, I wanted to be sympathetic and empathetic. In the end, neither could elicit the sentiment. The writing is charming, the diaglog witty and sharp, I just wish the characters and the book could have been a little more satisfying.
0307454541|2.0|I don't get all the hype over this book. I keep putting it down, it bores me so much. I stopped reading it & already read another more interesting book. Very disappointing.

B003LCIJZ2|5.0|I received this product in excellent condition and in an efficient amount of time. I purchased this item because Lady GaGa had not released this in the U.S.A yet and I wanted the album. I did not have to pay a high price and I received it before anyone else in America was even able to Pre-order yet. I was very happy with this purchase.
B003T6GVWI|5.0|This is my current favorite music.  Amazing. Simply beautiful, full of love, and most importantly FUN!
B003O85W3A|3.0|So, this album is definitely not terrible, but I prefer the previous ones. After a few listens it's just not growing on me. There are quite a few stand out songs, but after \\"Empty Room\\" (which is a great track) it seems to take a turn for the worst and hits the low point at \\"Month of May\\" (what an awful song). The album does go back up, however, and has a pretty strong finish. I'd still recommend it, I just expected a bit more from them!
B003J27WFW|5.0|What a fun documentary on that fun, solid, progressive, three piece, superb band known as RUSH. I was just a teen when RUSH was starting to break out here in Cleveland. They were sort of known as Cleveland's own. It was fun to recall the old days, and see the new days. They way they handled Neal's loss of his daughter then his wife seemed appropriate. It gave the fan just enough information without being intrusive.     The dinner a the hunter lodge was the perfect way to end the show.
1417058935|4.0|In TOPAZ (1969), Hitchcock spotters will have an easy time catching his wheelchair at the airport cameo. Special mention to Roscoe Lee Browne, who's excellent in a small but pivotal role during the NYC segment.<br /><br />This Cold War drama begins with a defection to the U.S. of high-ranking KGBer Boris Kusenov (Per-Axel Arosenius) and his revelation to debriefers of unnamed French spy 'Topaz' who's been supplying NATO secrets to the Russians. American CIA agent Michael Nordstrom (John Forsythe) asks his French counterpart currently stationed in D.C., Andre Devereaux (Frederick Stafford), for assistance in learning what exactly is contained in a secret Cuba/USSR agreement.<br /><br />Devereaux, who has strong ties to Fidel Castro's government as well as Resistance connections there, travels first to Harlem and then Cuba, even as Russian nukes are being shipped to that island. These medium range missiles and their Soviet operators quickly bring on the Oct.'62 Cuban Missile Crisis. Everywhere Andre goes during these perilous days, those close to him meet tragic fates. He himself pays a steep price for what's discovered, both personally and professionally.<br /><br />The only fault (if any) of this interesting adaptation of the Leon Uris espionage thriller is one of rhythm. The film goes on for an inordinately long time and when you expect a finale it takes another turn, a last bit of business that ends as unexpectedly as it begins. This jarring conclusion is followed by a cheesy montage of story highlights that flash over Maurice Jarr&eacute;'s music track. It's doubtful many in theaters stayed to see them.
B003X73QA8|5.0|Confronting the ever-impending threat of death, Arcade Fire  has never lacked angst or even outright anger in its music.  &#34;Funeral&#34; is a very literal reaction by the band after experiencing the deaths of relatives while recording.  &#34;Neon Bible&#34; apocalyptically outlined an emergent generation's fears of demise of their nation or greater society. With their latest release The Suburbs, the trend continues with an equally yet more localized destruction, this time focusing on crumbling pockets of isolated community.  But rather than another version of accepting death, The Suburbs is more a declaration of war on dual fronts.  On the one hand, it is a not very subtle declaration against certain waning generational forces, namely the baby-boomer generation (as my wife will strenuously assert, I must add).  Songs like &#34;City With No Children&#34; describe the anger against millionaires rotting in their decaying private prisons, &#34;Sprawl&#34; visualizing endless mountains of illuminated shopping malls, where we are urged to &#34;quit our pretentious things and just punch the clock&#34;, the insignificance of buildings built in the 70s that crumble without anyone caring, or worse, even noticing.  A double edged sword, the album is also a declaration of war on our internal forces.  Generation X has now grown up, and has to face not only the excess of the boomers but perhaps the lack of our willingness to overcome the boredom of the suburbs and mature beyond ourselves. Indeed, in the title track, Win Butler sings of a desperation to avoid something worse than death, not only growing old but having a family as a &#34;grown up&#34;.  Furthermore, the songs touch upon a future unable to be prepared for: losing friends to adulthood, remembering the glory and perfection of our wasted time in youth, realizing it may have been better to remain a kid on a bus longing to be free than to be an adult and dealing with the all-encompassing sprawl. It has a definite `80snostalgia but with a 21st century gut-wrenching epiphany of excess.  Musically, this is the tightest release yet by Arcade Fire. The vocals from Win Butler seem a little more constrained than Neon Bible, perhaps to rest his voice, but also to follow the psychological tension of the album.  Regine Chassagne has expanded her backup singing and really perfects the vulnerability in Sprawl II.  Admittedly, this is less Americana than previous albums, as the effervescent violin and volatile percussion is distinctly muted, nevertheless achieving its suburban atmosphere. There are too many excellent songs to list, but my favorites include &#34;Wasted Hours&#34;, &#34;We Used to Wait&#34;, &#34;Modern Man&#34; and the title track.  The Suburbs is a really powerful album, a quietly desperate Brian De Palma suburban gunfight erupting within indiscriminate cul-de-sacs across the country, perhaps right now in your neighborhood.
B002ZG983M|5.0|I saw the previews for this and thought it looked INCREDIBLY stupid.  I didn't see it in the theater and didn't even want to rent it but my husband forced me to because it received such positive reviews.  I've seen it at least 6 times now - GREAT movie.  The director truly is amazing - he took what could have easily been a dumb, cheesy movie and made something hilarious, action-packed and emotional.      Word of warning - this is not a kids movie.  It's violent and disturbing - think ruthless mobsters, a knife-wielding 11-year old girl and a bazooka among other treats.  It's unpredictable, the story surprised me constantly and to top it off the soundtrack is awesome.    Picture a mix between Wanted, Sin City and Superbad - over-the-top action, shocking violence and geeky humor - watch it.
B001GCUO5W|3.0|[warning: spoiler alert]    This movie is the complete opposite of the movie Coma, made back in 1978.    And yes, this movie is disturbing, just like the movie Coma.  In a way, it is what the sales agent would tell you, \\"they are doing the sales, caring for you and for your own good.  If you think they have other plans, you are thinking too much.\\"  Oh well, these days, I find it closer to the version of that instead of the version in the movie Shutter Island.    Yes, and in fact you do need the rust proof under your car for $2500, and $800 for the stain proof for your seats.  And they sell you the extended warranty really to hope you have the best product experience, that's why they are pushing it so hard.    It is like other popular events these days too: they give you a bowl of something that tastes good -- it is not real taste -- it is MSG.  They give you something that taste sweet.  It is not sugar, it is High Fructose Corn Syrup, something that the body cannot register as food.  They tell you to recycle the paper, and at the same time they use all those recycled paper at a lower cost to send you all the junk mails they want to.  More and more, I can't tell the meat is really chicken or pork.  I think they have a way to produce meat at high speed and they don't care as long as the profit is good.
B001IYCMNA|5.0|I have deployed many of these devices to both small businesses and to residences looking for a stable, reliable, Wireless-N solution that provided better range than the standard consumer-grade devices, and can attest to the fact that these work very well for those purposes. Even though it does not support 5GHz, the range/speed of it's operation in the 2.4GHz band far exceeds that of it's Linksys consumer grade devices, like the WAP610 (whose performance incidentally is abysmal).    At the currently discounted price-point of less than half of what they retailed originally for, they make perfect sense for residences that may have previously balked at the high price. Big thumbs up.

B0028MBKVG|5.0|Interesting and useful. I used to run no more than two three times a month due to joint pain I would feel for days after running.

B003L20IE2|5.0|I was just looking for a way to kill some time today and saw that most critics gave Scott Pilgrim Vs. The World positive reviews. I expected nothing more than mild entertainment, like my mindset when seeing The Expendables, but I left the theater with a surprise thought in my head. I have seen 28 movies in theaters so far this year, but the one I just walked out of is my second favorite, behind only Inception. I didn't expect that at all. It probably helped that the audience I saw it with was very vocal in the laugh department and that's always a plus when watching a comedy. I can't remember the last time I laughed as much at the movies. The dialogue and editing are very clever, but it's all the visual gags that take it beyond anything I've ever seen. Whether it's all the video game related music and concepts, or the Seinfeld theme, followed by a scene with a laugh track coming out of nowhere, it never stops thinking of new ways to make you smile in awe of it. To make a great thing even better, it also pulls off the action element and a minor romantic angle for the ladies. The fight scenes are creative and unique, and they even found room to throw in a few original rock tunes.<br /><br />I'm not the biggest Michael Cera fan, mainly because he's always acts the same, though I do admit that nobody can play a dork like him. His timing and delivery is excellent and he even had me believing in Michael Cera the action star by the end. This is easily my favorite role of his. Mary Elizabeth Winstead was another bit of perfect casting. She even managed to look good in all three of her crazy hair colors. Kieran Culkin got more than his share of laughs as Cera's gay roommate. All of the other supporting players (Chris Evans, Brandon Routh, Anna Kendrick and Jason Schwartzman being some of the big names) from top to bottom were amazing, without a single weak link.<br /><br />Writer/Director, Edgar Wright, of Shaun of the Dead and Hot Fuzz fame, got nearly everything right with this mini-masterpiece. You don't have to be a gamer to enjoy it, but it will sure make you appreciate it that much more. I guess I'm gonna have to make some room in my Blu-ray collection for this baby.rpiece.

B001PB3RU8|5.0|Wait, I lied. There are words. Beautiful is one. Ethereal is another.<br /><br />Basically, Florence and the Machine captures every basic, raw emotion a person has and spins into something spectacular and catching and soulful. I can see her rising above and beyond all of today's Pop Princesses and Punk Princes and staying there for a good long time. I can see this CD in my CD player for years and years, feeding it to my children and my grandchildren. Bought this CD at the tail end of February, and it's all I've been listening to since. There isn't a bad song on here. Although, I'm not hugely fond of Kiss with a Fist. To me, it's filler. It doesn't blend with the exquisite intricacy of the other songs. Florence's desire to blanket us with her music, to make us feel unbelievable, like running really really fast with our eyes closed, is truth. My heart is never empty when Lungs is in the background.<br /><br />Excellence. I WANT MORE!

0307454541|1.0|Hearing the hype around this book I decided to give it a chance figuring it was something special. Boy was I wrong. More than 50% of the book consists of just a round about gesture following the two main characters through life as they each go through a transitional period. The point was utterly lost on me and I could not even get far enough to figure out how they come to connect. Unfortunately the author did not weave a tale that kept me reading and ultimately took to long to get to the point of the story, that is the apparent murder mystery.<br /><br />The entire book felt like it was just a setup for another book down the line, which to me felt like a wasted printing of words.

B002HWBS96|5.0|holy molly. It is a very difficult opera. I couldn't help myself to think 'how could those singers remembers every words syndicate with actings? I mean in movies you get 'cut' by couple of mins max. But in this marathon opera they have to remember it all once and has to be perfect. For me, I think it is incredible task.<br /><br />The most beautiful part of this opera as many would be agree with me, is, the trio at the end. The very first time that I heard it was at Opera of Ozark by three beautiful singers. One of them were patient enough to even explained to me about what the meaning of this aria. That was the only time I heard it until now, years past. The melody is actually resembling the melody from a rather familiar vocal piece called 'the four last songs', also by Strauss (R). To me, it was almost symbolizes of his romanticism. Make sure you pay attention for this trio if you were first time to watch this opera like I do.<br /><br />You know what. I think the stage sets with mirrors didn't really bother me that much. In fact, it rather effective, though the transition between scenes were probably not very smooth. I found (maybe I am wrong), the European stage are more up to 'new' taste, trying varies forms to make up the stage. The Anna Netrebko's La Traviata stage sets was merely nothing but a huge 'clock'. But, I sort of feel maybe the stage director were trying NOT disturb the performance, they might just want you to really concentrate on the drama and the performance rather 'attracted' by the fancy beautiful stage. What do you think? Also, simple shape and figures can sometimes be very effective on visual expressions. There are lot of contemporary arts are like this way.<br /><br />I also think the singer who did \\"Baron Orchs' was amazing. His low register and voice overall are very comfortable to my voice. As other said Damrau and Koch were less impressive than Fleming, even the camera men were agree by giving her the most shots. But, Damrau and Koch are doing nothing wrong to my ear.<br /><br />Of course, Fleming were the center of this show and I am sure she gets the most of the money. She was very good on acting and her singing was perfect to me. (small talk) at the beginning of the opera when Fleming appeared, I was thinking she mostly had her hair done and possible a push-up bra from Victoria's Secretory.<br /><br />The Munchner Philharmoniker did a fantastic job. I listened very carefully about their playing in this opera. For people who doesn't know, I have to say the reason. This is not a opera orchestra, most piece they playing in a concert are around half an hour (symphonies). And this 211 mins, it is a huge challenge for them. Normally, there is probably only one orchestra doing opera and symphony together on regular basis - which is Wiener Philharmoniker. For Munchner Phil, a symphony orchestra, playing so well for this complicate opera, I give them two thumbs up. I also had saw a musician who I known personally since I was a child, also playing in this opera. I am very proud of him and very jealous at the same time.<br /><br />Maestro Thielemann, he is JUST right about any music of Richard Strauss. If you like his conducting, you may also want to hear his recording of 'Ein Heldenleben' with Wiener Philharnoiker. The best version of it so far, in my opinion. [...]o my ear.

There's four songs that I keep listening to, like an addiction, everytime I need to snap out of a 'snarky' or 'droopy' mood.  That's not to say that all the songs aren't ear-worthy, but these four get the blood flowing and the heat rising! The 'Drumming Song' is my fave this week. The lyrics in the chorus are infectious!  'Hurricane Drunk' was my favorite last week. 'Howl' is always my go-to song when I feel like imploding.  'Rabbit Heart' was the first song I heard that hooked me to this CD for life.  The lyrics throughout are fantastical and at times compelling. The tribal beats used with her Celtic-sounding voice is an intense combo that will keep me a big fan for a long time to come!

B002ZG99CC|5.0|The Karate Kid (2010) is a remake of the 1984 Ralph Macchio/Pat Morita classic. For some reason (probably marketing-related), the producers decided to keep the name \\"Karate Kid\\" instead of altering it to the more appropriate \\"Kung Fu Kid\\", a name fans have been calling it on the interwebs. For martial arts purists, \\"The Karate Kid\\" is inaccurate, because this movie is about kung fu, not karate. In China, this film is presented under the more accurate name \\"Kung Fu Dream\\". To avoid confusion, I will refer to this version as \\"Kung Fu Kid\\" in this review.<br /><br />The Karate Kid was made during the 80's, at the height of Japan's economic dominance. With China's rapidly growing influence and prominence in world affairs, it is only natural that more and more films these days are about China. Though the names and places are changed, the film sticks very closely to the original Karate Kid story arc. This is both good and bad. Fans of the original will be pleased that the 2010 version is so faithful in spirit and tone to the source material. But because of this, we get very few surprises with the main story progression. If you've seen the 1984 Karate Kid, you'll know how this film ends. However, I did not mind this at all. I enjoyed Kung Fu Kid tremendously and found all the changes and similarities refreshing after having seen so many awful attempts at \\"East meets West\\" kung fu films and bad remakes. This is a heartwarming family-friendly movie about love and friendship that seems to have been done with loving care and devotion on all sides. It also provides us a rare glimpse into daily Chinese urban life that, outside of films made by Chinese filmmakers, Americans rarely get to see. Much of the film is shot in cin&eacute;ma v&eacute;rit&eacute; style. If you don't like the shaky camera look, you might be annoyed.<br /><br />Story: Again, we have a single mom raising a boy. She moves a great distance in search of better job opportunities. Here, instead of moving from Raseda, NJ to LA, it's a bigger leap from Detroit to Beijing. In the original, Daniel is a high-schooler. Here, he is Dre, a middle school student (played by 12 year old Jaden Smith). The change is important. Maybe it's to market the film better to younger audiences, but it introduces a new dynamic to the film and changes the story quite a lot. He is still terrorized by bullies, but a 12-year old's problems and concerns are a lot different than a 16 year old's. Jackie Chan plays the part of Dre's teacher perfectly, Mr. Han. He is friend, surrogate father, and teacher, just as Mr. Miyagi was. Again, we have a man grieving from a deep personal tragedy and profound loss. I found that this was handled very well in the story and the change in details perfectly incorporated into the story.<br /><br />All the iconic Karate Kid moments are here, including the famous chopstick fly-catching bit. I won't spoil the surprise, but you'll laugh when you see it. We are also treated to a fantastic fight scene between Mr. Han and the bullies, showcasing Jackie Chan's signature comical kung fu choreography. As mentioned earlier, we get to see a part of Chinese life that is rare to see in American-made films. We see some fantastically intimate scenes of daily Chinese life and schooling in Beijing, a city that is both ancient and super modern at the same time. In the background of the famed Beijing Aquatic Center (Watercube) and Olympic Stadium (Bird's Nest), we have centuries-old traditional Chinese houses. We also see some of China's magnificent natural landscape as well as visit a Buddhist monastery where monks practice kung fu. The style of kung fu and philosophy show in the film is taichi chuan. This is never explicitly spoken, though the numerous depictions of the taichi symbol (yin-yang) appear throughout the film.<br /><br />The finale is all flash and rock n' roll, complete with an AC/DC and Red Hot Chili Peppers soundtrack, animated scoreboard graphics, fast cuts, and outrageously impossible kung fu/pro-wrestling moves for 13 year olds, like somersaults, leg lariats, and backflip kicks. This aspect of the movie I objected to. The producers just turned the ending into a video game. One kid even has hair like ([[ASIN:B002D4ERLE Street Fighter IV Action Figure Guile]]) and does a pre-fight touchup of his coif.<br /><br />To sum up, I was worried about this remake, but after having seen it, my fears were misplaced. The film is very enjoyable and wholesome and it is clear that the filmmakers have a lot of respect for the source material, the acting, as well the art of kung fu. There are many small changes made to bring this story into China and the 21st Century, but all of them done very well and naturally. It is an homage to the original and stands up as its own film. Highly recommended.ear olds, like somersaults, leg lariats, and backflip kicks. This aspect of the movie I objected to. The producers just turned the ending into a video game.

B00003CXBK|5.0|When buying this dvd, I wanted to spend under $20, but finally have my favorite Miyazaki movie. When it shipped, very fast I might add, I checked for any errors or scratches. The dvd played perfectly. No problems whatsoever. I highly recommend this store! I'm definitely going to return for any future movies.
B002ZG97RY|2.0|Green Zone is an arrogant, self-indulgent political thriller that doesn't thrill, since you already know the story before it even takes place. Green Zone doesn't add anything new to the debate and doesn't really care to. Call it wish-fulfillment, or call it a misguided attempt at a compelling political thriller sprinkled with action, but Green Zone doesn't succeed in much of anything.<br /><br />First off, I actually agree with what the film is trying to say. My disagreement is not on a political level. Quite the opposite, the film actually makes some good points on why the WMD mishap happened. Granted, you have to work in the subtext, but when Matt Damon is shut down by his Superior's because of his rank, and because of the lack of questioning and oversight in the military, that's one of the real-world reasons. Greengrass also adds a lot of great detail to the film about the experience of the early days of the war in general, such as the mood of the citizens, the various looting, etc. It's the Clark Poundstone I didn't really care for in the least bit. Granted, you have to condense real people into a central person, but Poundstone is simply a one-note character there to be evil. But Matt Damon doesn't really have a personality either, as he is simply a vehicle for the events around him, and very little beyond that. Thus, since the writing is mostly terrible and everything else is middling, it's Greengrass' direction that makes it at least somewhat interesting. I like the way he uses the shaky-cam, I like the way he presents the movie, with the exception of dialogue scenes.<br /><br />But getting back to the Iraq War aspect of it, it all feels like water under the bridge since there is very little perspective to the movie. It took a good ten years for good Vietnam War movies to start coming out, and it took that long because the films had perspective. Greengrass thought of the idea in 2004 for the film barely a year after it happened. There's no way you can have prospective on it. There's no way you can look at the events without emotion or bias. The thing about the Bourne movies is that even though they were dealing with current issues, the fiction of it felt distant enough to give it a little prospective.<br /><br />Thus, Green Zone feels kind of like Bourne placed into the real world, and the resulting mash-up is sort of a trainwreck. Bourne dialogue now sounds stupid/poorly written. Bourne characters now feel needlessly one-note. Even the roguish Matt Damon character doesn't translate well into the real world. As a result, while Green Zone does some interesting things, it's not nearly enough to keep you engaged in the movie.There's no way you can look at the events without emotion or bias.

B0034G4OU4|3.0|Based on the bestselling \\"memoir\\" (air quotes because of the $200,000 advance her publisher gave her to essentially travel for a year and then write a book about it; I question the authenticity then of much of what she pens - characters, vignettes, anecdotes, and all) of the same name, by Elizabeth Gilbert, the movie is far more palatable, to my taste, if only because of the pretty pictures of the moving places where the book was set and the movie filmed - Rome, somewhere in India, and Bali.<br /><br />If you hated the book, as I did (full disclosure: I ate up Eat in Rome, but the slog through the ashram in India was too much - I found myself Praying for it to end or get better, neither of which came to pass, so I simply gave up and said to hell with this piece o' Oprah-touted crapola), I think the movie is still worth your while for the well-shot scenery. Though the over-acting and bumper-sticker speak is often hard to stomach.<br /><br />Watch it with the sound off and you just might Love it!

Using MySQL as an example is also very convenient.<br /><br />Overall, great book and if you wish to improve on structures of your queries - buy it.

B003O85W3A|4.0|Two days ago I got this CD and I must say that I felt in love with it right away. Aracde fire's new album was one of the few this year that I've been waiting for. Of course, this is no way near \\"Neon bible\\" (2007) and its gothic-indie dark sound which was the reason why I felt in love with this band. I mean, \\"The Suburbs\\" doesn't posses those magnificent moments nor the big arrangements found in its predecessor but the intention from the band that I got as soon as I listened to the whole album was not to do that again. Instead, Arcade fire put all its money in this \\"weird\\" mainstream sound a la \\"Echo and the bunnymen\\" and by moments maybe flirting with \\"Joy division\\" style.<br /><br />\\"The suburbs\\" (the first single and track of the record) is a weird, catchy tune played by a band setting up a pop record on their own terms. \\"Ready to start\\" is the first move the band made here to sound \\"easier and more loose\\" for the listeners' benefit if they had any problems with their previous records. \\"Modern man\\" is a great song... very catchy and fun to listen to (for some reason R.E.M. comes to my mind with this song). \\"Rococo\\" on the other hand isn't exactly one of my favorites but still has this weird vibe that Arcade fire got me used to after \\"NB\\". \\"Empty room\\" seemed to be co-written with a Radiohead member back in 1995 (in the whole \\"The Bends\\" era). Weird, catchy arrangements pointing to total hysteria when actually is just turns out to be another pop number (loved the string sample at the very beginning). \\"City with no children\\" is the first song that might feel the hardcore fan of the band pretty uncomfortable considering that this track sounds like anything U2 could do in their big shows. \\"Half light I\\" is pretty cool (darky and somehow freindly to listen to... very 70's vibe on this one with the organ and the strings) and then \\"Half light II (no celebration)\\" comes back to picks up where \\"city with...\\" left... another pop song a la U2. I must say that \\"Suburban war\\" is one of the strongest songs in the record if you ask me. More indie rock is going on here and less synths around the track. From this point on and for the next following four songs the record seems to be stuck in a hole. The songs \\"Month of may\\", \\"Wasted hours\\", \\"Deep blue\\" and \\"We used to wait\\" don't really offer anything interesting to listen to... a little punk going on here and there, some piano samples and some acoustic guitars now and then make this part of the record a little boring. I'm not saying that the songs are bad 'cause actually they're not. It's just that these tracks don't seem to be in the same level as the first ones were. To me they're just a bridge you have to cross before arriving to another great part of these \\"Suburbs\\". Once you're on the other side \\"Sprawl I\\" will be waiting for you with another dark vibe like \\"Half light I\\" did. And then, \\"Sprawl II (mountains beyond mountains)\\" comes. The poppiest song on the record. A very 80's sound with bunch of synth samplers going on and a beat that you might want to dance with as well. I liked this song a lot but is not exactly what I could expect from a band like Arcade fire. Finally, \\"The suburbs (continued)\\" is just a pointless reprise track from the first one if you ask me to finish the record.<br /><br />To sum up, this record is great but as a huge fan that I was with \\"Neon bible\\" I was expecting the band to dare more and to try something \\"more challenging\\" for them in order to put their music skills to work. To be more explicit, when Radiohead released \\"Ok computer\\" (1997) I expected the same from them after that record and what I received three years later was one of the weirdest record I have ever listened to \\"KID A\\" (2000) and from that moment on they went up hill ever since. Arcade fire can do something WAY more consistant and precious that the.. well, let's just call \\"the suburbs\\" a comfortable record.of the strongest songs in the record if you ask me.

B0017HMF6W|5.0|Now this is the classic thriller and I think that because of this adventure they started the James Bond series.  I have always enjoyed this movie but the thing about it was I was worried that it would not be much different on Blu-ray.  Boy was I wrong I don't know how they got the classic copy of this film but even though it was made in the 50s the picture is excellent and it almost looks like 3D.  I cannot tell you how nice this version is you have to see it for yourself.  I hope you have a large enough screen to enjoy this.
B003NFM3JU|5.0|I really love this story and am especially a fan of Robert Zemeckis and his work. I find it hard to believe that some people were turned off by A Christmas Carol, but everyone is entitled to their opinion. I found there to be equal amounts of adults and children in the theater when I went to see this film. Couples ranging from late teens to middle age were there and laughing along with the kids. It was a lot of fun and I plan to purchase the Blu Ray when it's available. I was a fan of The Polar Express and I'm a sucker for motion capture animation. I'll rank this movie along with the Polar Express as one of my top classic Christmas movies. [[ASIN:B000AGTPUK The Polar Express (Widescreen Edition)]]
B0029O08WA|3.0|Don't get me wrong. It's still an awesome soundtrack. I just think that Twilight was way better. It just seems like they didn't work as hard at choosing the songs that would go into the movie this time around. But at least Muse is on there again.
B0017JKEL8|5.0|I'll just chime in with what everyone else is saying: this is great television.     The writing is astounding. The acting is excellent. There is little of the overacting and cliches that plague most modern television. The \\"Kodak carousel\\" scene is one of the great scenes in all of television.    Unfortunately, the series dropped off sharply after the first season and started to accrete cliches, although it still had moments of wonder.    The blu-ray looks very good and I strongly advise it over the DVD. The textures from the 1960s are interesting to see, for one thing, and the characters, because they do not overact, require close scrutiny.
B003CFBQBW|2.0|Well, clearly this is the worst of the bunch. Maybe it's just because I need to see the movie again. I barely remember any of those songs. Maybe I would have a much better review if I did. :)
B0036TGSR6|5.0|It was so much fun to watch a true mystery thriller movie, rather than endless high tech, car chases and violence.<br /><br />With Director Roman Polanski, it took me back to his 1974 classic \\"Chinatown\\" where he not only directed, but had a cameo part roughing up private eye Jack Nicholson.<br /><br />Here we move up to near current events, with a Tony Blair type person trying to set the record straight re the Iraq war, rendition, torture, etc.  Come to think of it, these concerns are still with us. But the Blair person in the movie hopes for a new biography to clear his name.<br /><br />A ghost writer comes in to try and polish the work of a previous ghost writer who ran into severe difficulties. He gets a month to polish the draft, then a new deadline of two weeks<br />This would be a very tough job for any writer, but add some romance and almost daily challenges and turns.<br /><br />Pierce Brosnan plays the Blair role, and I told my wife I thought he did a great job.<br />She remained focused on Polanski's legal problems, which is a good point. But can't we just look at his recent work with this movie and let the legal system work its wonders?<br /><br />I think you will enjoy this movie, especially if you are a mystery fan. We just do not get many movie mysteries like this. I hope Hollywood and the Independents come out with many more.
B001ED7C58|4.0|I think this is my favorite of the three soundtracks. I can't seem to stop listening to it. Muse is the greatest band and am very pleased that they are included in all three soundtracks. Rob Pattinson is not bad either. Extremely mellow song, but easy to listen to. Just wish they could have picked a more current Collective Soul song.
0061714372|3.0|Let me state up front that I am a lifelong Megadeth fan, as well as a Dave Mustaine fan.  I was completely looking forward to reading this book, and did so in one day (considering that I rarely make it to Chapter 2 of ANY book these days, that's nothing short of a miracle).  In fact, just learning of this book's release helped me rediscover the band and their music in a way that I haven't in years.  My review of this book is intended to be as dispassionate as possible.<br /><br />If I had to summarize this book in one word, that word would be \\"sanitized\\".  Dave tells his story very non-objectively, and in several instances, certain events feel glossed over, with details that would embarrass Dave or paint him as the bad guy seemingly omitted, or possibly altered.  I didn't gather Dave accepting any personal responsibility for some of his past mistakes (a classic behavioral trait for an addict).<br /><br />Ironically, the one thing that has motivated Dave's musical career is the same thing that has held him back personally, and that is his ousting from Metallica in 1983.  As evidenced by this book, he has still not let that incident go, despite his forming and sustaining a heavy metal monster beloved by millions ever since.  The writing of this book ebbs and flows from Dave's trademark (and sometimes forced) abrasive humor to introspection of his time here on earth and back again.  Different sides of Dave's personality are definitely on display here, for better or for worse.  Maybe that alone is evidence that Dave is finally coming to terms with the life that he's lived.  I, for one, wish him peace (not to mention health).<br /><br />One thing that really surprised me is how image-conscious Mustaine is when it comes to his band.  He always struck me as someone who didn't care what someone looked like, so long as they played the right notes and walked in lockstep.  If anything, what I came away with was the sense that Dave is very seriously considering hanging it up for good.  He expressed regret over missing his son Justus grow up, and doesn't want to miss out on his daughter Electra doing the same.  That's a pretty powerful motivation, and if that's what Dave is using to contemplate bringing Megadeth to an end, then nobody can fault him for that.<br /><br />Reading this book didn't make me any less of a fan of Dave or Megadeth.  If anything, it has reignited my love for the band and their music.  But I would caution those interested in reading this book that it is more a portrait of Dave Mustaine the man, than of Megadeth the band.  I hope that he'll pick up the pen again one day to delve deeper into the history of the band itself.  Other than a few road stories (I'll never enjoy A1 Steak Sauce again...thanks, Dave), the tales told within 'Mustaine' are common knowledge to most fans of the band.  This is a quick, easy read, as well as a very good book...but it's not a great book.  I consider this book an appetizer; I look forward to the main course.ssed regret over missing his son Justus grow up, and doesn't want to miss out on his daughter Electra doing the same.

0783226063|1.0|See subject... GREAT, iconic book, but bad film adaptation of same. One of director David Lynch's few disappointing works.  In his defense, Dune is nearly unfilmable, at least as a single movie.      To dwell on this vast disappointment at all is very painful to me, so I'll just say it sucks and move on.     Except to say, the ending... god. It is SO inexcusable and indefensible... a complete and utter slap in the face to any fan of the books. It RAINS?  \\"And now Muad'dib will bring love.\\" Oh geez, straight Hollywooded-up BS. No other way to say it- F***  that.    It doesn't even make logical sense, either. I really hope that part was the studio's idea, and not Lynch's.    (To the ppl voting this review down, sorry, but if you'd read the book, you'd know that the movie blew chunks, and is not even within shouting distance of the standard of the book(s). And I say this as someone who LOVES both the book and most of David Lynch's work in general. They were two great tastes that somehow didn't taste great together.)

B0036EH3XE|2.0|I watched lost from the very beginning. I followed the show the way I had never followed any tv show before. I never missed an episode and would even buy the dvd seasons as soon as they came out. I really felt like it was a new and fresh show. Over the years I became concerned because it seemed like the writers were creating more mysteries and questions than they could possibly answer or explain adequately. I still stayed loyal because I would hear them talk about how they had many parts of the show planned from the beginning and I loved the characters and mystery of the show so much that I kept watching. I cannot believe how much they ruined the entire show in the 6th season. Looking back on all of it now you can tell that they were flying by the seat of their pants the whole time. It's not that they left just a few questions unanswered they left dozens of questions and mysteries unanswered and the questions they did answer they did it in a sloppy and forced way. I wish that I could complete my dvd collection and recommend the show to others but I cannot do that. I felt like I should warn people before they become too invested in the show because you will most likely be very disappointed.
B001OQCV2E|3.0|The first 1 1/2 hours of this disaster movie is a trite Hollywood compendium of \\"Deep Impact\\", \\"Armageddon\\" and \\"The Day After Tomorrow.\\"  Then it actually gets good.  So if you can hold on, the last hour is worth it, in my opinion.    In Deep Impact & Armageddon, the world is going to end from a comet impact.  In the Day after Tomorrow it's Global Warming.  In \\"2012\\" it's a massive neutrino eruption from the Sun that heats the core and loosens the crust.  The triteness is thick for a while:  you got the intrepid geo-scientist from \\"Tomorrow,\\" the governmental conspiracy and Washington focus from \\"Deep Impact,\\" the cracks and tsunamis from \\"Deep Impact,\\" the world-wide scope from \\"Independence Day,\\" the super-hero Dad from \\"Tomorrow,\\"  and the modern-day \\"Noah's Ark\\" from \\"When World's Collide.\\"  All with some twists:  In 2012, it's the Chinese who make the arks (I guess the US is too refined to make any huge manufacturing products any more!) The first part of the movie is filled with lots of destruction and ridiculous escapes from massive earthquakes.  (Sure, if there's a huge earthquake, just get in your car and drive like a maniac!  THAT's how to escape it!)    The good part comes when we get to know the characters, and they're getting onto the massive arks, and there's some real drama when you wonder who is going to live and who is going to die.  It's still a bit melodramatic though.  The Black Geologist PhD (doesn't everyone know one?) saves the world, by overruling the entire chain-of-command on his ark (and getting all the good Euros to vote down the selfish Donald Rumsfeld type). Also the Super-Duper-Divorced-Dad wins his son's and ex-wife's affection back from the doomed Stepfather (don't you ever wonder why Divorced Dads are so often heros in Hollywood movies?  Probably a lot of directors are divorced!)    Still, it's worth a few bucks for entertainment and some good effects.
0451228731|2.0|This story starts out like a murder mystery, slowly becomes a sort of interesting Michael Crichton novel but soon begins to bloat into a vast world wide conspiracy that not only overwhelms the reader but the writer himself who doesn't quite seem to know how to land this massive airbus of a plot on a runway as small as a dirt road. Where writers patiently build their characters, this book seems to jump from one extremely shallow character to another, much like the daemon process that seems to traverse an ether space and jump from computer to computer - undying, relentless and, frankly, unbelievable. You can write an AI program that parses RSS feeds, screen-scrapes news and maybe even initiates a voice over ip call to randomly selected individuals. But this daemon thingy is far beyond that - it's like the spirit in the exorcist - it possesses people, picks on their psychological weaknesses and manipulates them into doing its bidding. What exactly is its bidding? Its not entirely clear, but world domination appears to be one of them. Can this possibly happen in the near future in reality? On a small scale possibly, but at the scale depicted in the story, the plot degenerates into utter silliness and incredulity.<br />The book is gripping in small parts, but the parts don't come together for the whole to be impressive by any stretch. While the explicit language in an Updike novel blends in, the unwarranted scenes and language just stuck out like a sore thumb.<br /><br />-------------<br />Was watching the 1998 X-Files episode 'Kill Switch' and could not help but notice many similarities. The ear splitting sound Mulder encounters by the shed; the daemon that controls satellites and goes beyond consciousness in cyberspace.
0316044938|1.0|The beginning of the book is horrendous--a horrible attack on a 14 year old girl.  The rest of the book plods on slowly as she watches the events of her family and friend's lives unfold.  While there is a wonderful message--appreciate everything in life and appreciate the gift of living, the story just plods along slowly.  I wouldn't recommend this book to anyone.

B0029LHX1W|3.0|Tom Rob Smith's CHILD 44 has an A+ start and C- ending. The first two hundred pages are riviting as he details the insanity that was Stalinist Russia. Constant fear, inhumane coldheartedness and brutal viciousness dominant each and every life, something that protagonist Leo Demidov never considers, which makes his fall even more riviting when the tables are turned and his world is crushed. Smith sets the stage beautifully, and for half the novel I was amazed, but then he resorts to movie of the week tricks to resolve the story. Without giving away the plotline, to say that the ending is improbable is an understatement. And yet, Smith shows real talent and my hope is that his future novels will both start and end well.

B000U7169M|2.0|Your standard \\"non-believer shown the power of god neener-neener-neener\\" story, likewise packed with religious pandering.    The film attempts not one but two twist endings, neither one particularly plausible or impressive.    I do like the imagery of a savage, vengeful god slaughtering the unbelievers though...simply because it's honest. That's the god of the bible, and I appreciate the accuracy of the depiction.
B003HARV3Y|4.0|Movie arrived in good condition and was in fine working order.
B002ZG983M|4.0|This movie is awesome, it was one of very few comic based movies to stay as true to the source material as possible. Sure there were some exceptions but they didnt leave out any important detail whether it be Hit-Girl violant and gory attacks or sub plots. Nicholas Cage does a great job playing Big-Daddy. In interviews he based his acting method in the movie with Adam West who played Batman (there are similarities in look between the two) from the 70s tv show.    Now dont expect this to be a teen action movie about a nerdy high schooler who becomes a super hero. Its rated R for a very good reason. I wont get into details but I would just saw some scenes arent for the faint of heart. So parents dont have your little kids watching this because it looks like a Spider-Man like movie.    Now the only reason I didnt give this a perfect score is simple. Not enough special features.    Special features:  -Commentary with the director  -A documentary on the making of the comic  -Storyboard art (no video just looking at them)  -Movie trailers    I would have liked to see maybe behind the scenes, a second commentary with the cast, maybe the auditions, an interview with Mark Miller (created it) and some others.    Usually comic movies have ton of features since there is a lot to talk about but this dvd falls short on great. Sure the documentary was very interesting to watch but they should have had more.

0316067598|1.0|In his excellent book \\"The New American Militarism\\", Col. Andrew  Bacevich U.S. Army, (ret.) cites a 2003 poll among military personal that reveals two thirds of those surveyed feel they are morally superior to the American populace at large.  He quotes retired admiral Stanley Arthur expressing concern that \\"...more and more, enlisted as well as officers are beginning to feel that they are special, better than the society they serve.\\"   Perhaps this helps explain author Marcus Luttrell's patronizing tone in his account of a Navy SEALs' ill-fated mission to kill a Taliban leader in Afghanistan.  It is fortunate SEALS are in such terrific physical condition lest Luttrell risk breaking his arm in this protracted patting of his own back.    After allowing as how he is not a \\"political person\\", he lectures us on a variety of subjects;  from the naivety and wrongheadedness of the military's Rules of Engagement designed to minimize civilian causalities, to the \\"squeaking and squealing\\" liberals who do not have the clarity of thought to see The One Truth; i.e., the world as he sees it, to the bold, visionary leadership of George W. Bush.    Luttrell describes at length the training and weeding out process involved in SEAL training. Repeatedly we hear of the physical, intellectual, emotional and, yes, moral qualities needed to be a Navy SEAL. Only the best of the best are selected.  To be sure, the resilience, dedication, and commitment of a SEAL are something only a few possess.  Luttrell is proud to the point of arrogance to have achieved this rarified status.  SEAL training does not give one particular insight to geo-politics, as his sophomoric evaluation of our invasion of Iraq illustrates.  Nor, apparently, does it prepare one for a thoughtful, critical analysis of one's own inclinations and sentiments.  How else to explain the contradictions and non-sequeters.   He seems oblivious to the hubris that led to this disastrous mission.  To be sure, he and his comrades fought valiantly.  But how ill-advised was it for his commanders, SEAL commanders, to send only four fighters to confront an experienced, motivated, well equipped fighting force operating on its own turf that was known to outnumber the SEALS at least twenty or thirty to one?  The subsequent rescue mission ended disastrously as well with an even greater loss of life.   It completely escapes him that for all their training, equipment, planning, and supreme confidence, the fact is the SEALS were soundly beaten on the field of battle.  He notes that civilians are always killed in wars and that avoiding civilian causalities is inconvenient to those conducting the war.  Rather than acknowledge that this is but one of the reasons why war is horrible and is to be avoided except when absolutely necessary, he seems to use it as a rationale to abandon efforts to minimize the death of non-combatants; hence, civilians are expendable.  General Douglas Petraus who literally wrote the book on anti-insurgency says the number one rule is to shoot as few bullets as possible and avoid alienating the population at all costs.  An insurgency cannot live without support from civilians and there is no surer way to turn civilians into insurgents then to kill their family and friends.   Luttrell seems utterly oblivious to this.  After his fellow SEALS are killed by enemy fighters, Luttrell is sheltered by locals, given food, water, medical attention, and protected from the Taliban.  These villagers risk terrible reprisal from the Taliban for their defiance.   Yet apparently, he would cavalierly sacrifice civilians, such as those to whom he owes his life, in the name of expediently accomplishing the \\"mission\\".    When the body of one his comrades was found, it was discovered that he had been shot in the face at close range.  Luttrell bristles at this barbarism, proclaiming that no one had better mention the Geneva Convention lest he bubble over with righteous indignation.  But Luttrell has no moralcompunctions with his mission's objective to search the countryside, find a particular Taliban leader, and kill him from a distance with a high powered rifle - head shot, presumably, the sniper's shot of choice.  There are many books relating battlefield experiences that are gripping, heartbreaking and humble.   The message of heroics speaks for itself.  Lutrell has learned how to write a book (or more accurately have it ghost written for him).  I can't help but wonder if he's ever read one.

B002K0WBXW|1.0|When will Hollywood stop putting out these awful rom-coms? Probably when Sandra Bullock stops playing herself.  The script of this film is dire; the actors often appear embarassed delivering their lines. The plot is thin and predictable. The comedy is nothing original or even that funny. If Sandra Bullock's acting ability is deserving of an Academy Award, then it makes a farce of the whole process. Yes, I've seen The Blind Side and she's the same in that...Sandra Bullock.

B0036TGSR6|2.0|What happened to Roman Polanski? If this film had been made by anyone else, they would have said it was a bomb. I was so disappointed by the lack of tension and the preponderance of cliches in this film. Pierce Brosnan was good as a Tony Blair-like Prime Minister, but Ewan McGregor gets my vote as one of the most bland and colorless movie stars out there. Kim Cattrell's character didn't make much sense. I didn't care for any of the characters and the denouement was interesting but the ending just fell flat to me (like McGregor's body). Some parts of the film dragged on to the point where I was falling asleep (Ewan talks. Brosnan talks. They talk some more. Then more talk.) Was Polanski too worried about his upcoming trial in the U.S. to make a good, suspenseful thriller? I felt he was uncommonly restrained in what should have been a nail-biting thriller. Oh well...I guess even great directors have bad days.
0385340990|5.0|I enjoyed reading this book so much, that I thought a friend of mine, whose birthday was coming up, would also enjoy the book.  He was born in England and is a writer.  I'm sure he was aware of the story behind this book, so he would enjoy it that much more.
B001HN69B8|2.0|I found the concepts and ideas behind \\"The Imaginarium of Doctor Parnassus\\" interesting, and I found the film itself visually intriguing.  However, the execution of the story is downright sloppy, and it was made more so by the untimely loss of Heath Ledger.  I am hoping this disaster fades from memory quickly.
B0015DROBO|4.0|Somehow I came across Stieg Larsson's books on Amazon and decided to buy all three . . . and I'm glad I did.  I just finished The Girl With The Dragon Tattoo and found that it was one of those rare books that you can describe with the old clich&eacute;' \\"I couldn't put it down.\\"  You first met the two main characters Mikael Blomkvist and Lizabeth Salander and I felt I was looking at a relationship between Bogart's Phillip Marlowe and Ellen Page's Juno with a dark side (in fact I think Ellen Page would make the perfect Salendar in the impending movie with Daniel Craig.)<br />Although the story was packed with characters to the point it was difficult for me to keep up with all of them, (but I'm getting old so forgive me), the multiple stories kept my interest piqued to the point I was going to bed long after my normal bedtime.  There were parts of the story that seemed to drag on a little too long, but just when I felt boredom start to creep in, off the tale went in a different direction and grabbed my attention again.<br />Salendar was a great character and I'm glad to see in the 2nd book, The Girl Who Played With Fire, she continues to remain in Larsson's story.  Not a young lady one would want to date, her many conflicting personalities makes you love her anyway and want the best for her.  Dragon was a great read and won't disappoint those who like `who done it' mysteries.

B0000009RX|4.0|After the band's mis-hit second album \\"Absolutely free\\", they return to the ambience and accessibility of their debut album \\"Freak out!\\"...and surpassing it in the process. This album is listenable, engaging and experimental but accessible in a poppy way, to an extent. Themes of alienation and the culture divide are elegantly constructed (in contrast to their smugness in covering this ground on \\"Absolutely free\\"). Musically, there is a combination of 'British invasion' kind of influences and what Captain Beefheart would do soon after with \\"Trout mask replica\\". Fortunately for Zappa, he constructs his own experimental explorations in a more accessible way than Beefheart...\\"Trout mask replica\\" is so solipsistic that it disappears inside it's own alimentary canal. Will have to check what year my cd was released...don't think it is the remastered version, though it shares the cover art of the album I'm linking to here.      Best songs on first listen \\"(.)\\":      Mom & dad - a genteel, melancholy tune...perhaps with a touch of The Velvet Underground to it. Tribal sounding drums on the right hand side. Keyboard and lead guitar feature. Not the first song on the album to deal with police brutality. A nice, pleasant song...bumped up my opinion of it on second listen from \\"[.]\\".    Absolutely free - \\"[.]\\" piano intro then becomes relatively poppy with military style drumming. Features harmonies and later a harpsichord, I think. Good stereo balance to the song. Sound a bit foggy, a la Blue Cheer's debut album...that is, heavy and dull sound. Atypical for this album.    Let's make the water turn black - features piano, acoustic guitar and dual vocals. Catchy harmonies and melodies.       Next best songs on second listen \\">[.]\\":      The idiot bastard son - comes across as a sort of Beatles meets Captain Beefheart...kind of a demented \\"She's leaving home\\" (off of The Beatles' \\"Sgt.Pepper\\" album). Features bass guitar, acoustic guitar, later on electric guitar bobs up, keyboard and some studio chit-chat included in the mix.    Lonely little girl - keyboard on this track has a George Harrison/Beatles \\"While my guitar gently weeps\\" vibe to it. Also seem to detect a Herman's Hermits vibe to the song too. Intro has acoustic and electric guitar. Strumming, multi-vocals and brass instruments appear.    Mother people - has piano and harmonies. Lead guitar. I like the drumming in this track. Perhaps the archetypal Frank Zappa here...he tries to get into the conformist mind...you get a symptom here of mutual incomprehension of this \\"other\\". \\"Mum & dad\\" also veers into this thematic territory.      The rest:      Are you hung up? - experimenta - talking voices and weird effects utilised, but that's ok. Bit of a time capsule too, this song...has a lot of 1960s lingo. Sensual at times to the ear.    Who needs the peace corp? - lead guitar on acoustic. Drums on the right hand side. Like the drum tone. Sometimes brassy. Not sure, but this may be the first time you hear the word \\"shote\\" in mainstream music. Like the lyric \\"Every town must have a place where hippies meet\\".    Concentration moon - drums on right hand side. Multi-vocals/harmonies.  More social critique here, revisiting the opening track's themes (\\"Are you hung up?\\"). Like the lyric \\"Hair growing out of every hole in me\\".    Telephone conversation - 0:48 seconds long. Intriguing telephone conversation...I'm curious to know if it was for real or if the subject matter covered was true. Wikipedia lists this as an additional track for the cd release...not on the original LP in other words, I think.    Bow tie daddy - 0:33. An English style song from the first half of last century, I think...have in mind songs like \\"Mad dogs and Englishmen\\"...that kind of vibe. Wikipedia lists the original LP version of this song being almost three times longer than the cd version...there are some discrepancies like that.     Harry, you're a beast - piano intro. Has a Herman's Hermits vibe to it, perhaps. Features acoustic guitar, harmonies and a xylophone or some such instrument, I think. Outro has backwards playing material. More lyrics against conformist people...I like the line \\"You're phony on top, you're phony underneath\\".     What's the ugliest part of your body? - 1950s style do-wop, which is cute. Later there's some John Lennon-esque vocals, perhaps. Run time is 1:03. Lyrics have a sting in the tail...a nice twist from what the title hints at.     Flower punk - starts as a sort of \\"Hey Joe\\" parody with Bart Simpson singing, it seems! Vocals get a bit more chipmunk like later. Then it seems Beavis and Butthead have some words of wisdom too! Has a cheesy sounding keyboard. You hear two distinct voices in each channel.     Hot poop - 0:26. Soothing, sensual male voice features. You hear a backwards voice too.    Nasal retentive calliope music - screechy electronic noises kick off this instrumental - um, well words do feature in this track, but it's not a song as such - which then ends with a surf music vibe as far as the beat and guitar sounds go.    Take your clothes off - multi-vocals here, including a female singer, I presume. Harmonies. A cutesy, poppy track. You can see which side of the culture divide is on when the lyric \\"We know that hair ain't where it's at\\" is sung. Acoustic and electric guitars are catchy, but it's mostly acoustic guitar here.    What's the ugliest part of your body? (reprise) - 1:02. Like the first version of this song here, but becomes chaotic at the end, unlike the first time around.     The chrome plated megaphone of destiny - 6:25. Experimental track. Synthesiser plays then you hear some cursory sounding piano playing, demented cackling and plucking of guitar strings. Maybe this is a kind of an alternative jazz track or something. The word \\"arbitrary\\" is used in this song, like it was some kind of catch-phrase. There was a mockumentary series here in Australia called \\"Summer Heights High\\" where one of the school girl characters usedthe phrase \\"random\\". I can attest that that catch-phrase actually had some pull...you hear people use that here every now and again. Typical Frank Zappa...even his catch-phrases didn't take on!      Recommendations:      Mothers Of Invention - Freak out! In the same league as this album and similarly catchy.    Captain Beefheart and The Magic Band - Trout mask replica. Not a fan of this album, but if a major objection for anyone who finds Zappa's albums to commercial (so to speak), then this album is a 'take no prisoners' approach...they don't seem to care at all if anyone likes the album apart from themselves!

B00005NB8J|5.0|What an excellent beginning to the Stargate: SG-1 and Stargate: Atlantis series.  The replacement of key characters is forgiveable because they work so well together in the series.  This movie is as entertaining a story as storytelling can get.  My wife made the comment that this movie gets better every time she watches it, and I have to agree.  We've only ever watched the extended cut so I can't speak to the theatrical version except to say that I certainly wouldn't want to watch a chopped version of this movie.  I've read some of the one star reviews of Stargate and all I can say is that naysayers need to just stay away from Science Fiction altogether.  -kd5-

B002ZG983M|2.0|It seems the supporters of this movie are legion here at Amazon, but I don't have any problems taking the less popular opinion.  My husband and I were at the supermarket when a family full of kids in front of us rented this film out.  I would be terrified if my 9 and 11 yr old ever got to see this film.<br /><br />The combination of irrational music with inappropriate images probably began with Kubrick's Clockwork Orange.  Tarantino supercharged it and made it \\"cool\\" for girls to go around hacking people up and chopping limbs off - something that were it done by men, would be criticized as gratuitous violence.  \\"Kick Ass\\" is just an inevitable progression, from women being violent, to young girls being violent.  If this is all just entertainment with no real-life consequences, then how is it you now see young school girls today kicking and punching each other on youtube without a moment's hesitation?  When boys do it, it's already reprehensible, but I suppose it's socially acceptable given their history of violence and cultural conditioning.  However, girl's have traditionally provided an alternative...a place to go, a peaceful choice, when you want to opt out of violence.  If every girl started imitating what boys do, then there is no longer an option: violence is THE only answer.<br /><br />I suppose this is- or eventually will be - what it will mean to be a \\"modern\\" girl. Did anyone even notice Rasuls's girlfriend getting violently impaled against a door with two knives by the 11 year old girl?  What did the girlfriend do that deserved that kind of \\"justice?\\"  And I still don't understand why so many men find it sexy and cool for girls to do exactly what other men do.  Imagine if a male superhero (say Superman, or Batman came into the enermy's lair and stabbed the enemy's girlfriend to death.  People would react a different way)<br /><br />If you just want entertainment, then as an adult, this movie may entertain you.  But the subversiveness of packaging it as a kid's flick shows that Hollywood will stop at nothing to make a quick buck.

0385339585|5.0|I picked up this book from a coworker who practically forced me to take it from her telling me how good it was.  I was just going to read a few pages to say I'd attempted it and then return it to her.  I started reading it just before bed one night and didn't put it down until 1am, by which time I'd read 1/3 of the way through.  It is that good!  I challenge anyone to try and read the first 3-4 pages and put it down.<br /><br />  That said, I see there are a number of haters on here who gave it 1 star, probably because it portrays Christians in a positive light.  Either that, or they don't like the anti-materialist message.  I just loved the juxtaposition between the wealthy, greedy heirs and the simple missionary, who was the only content person in the story.<br /><br />  This is a great story, I recommend it 100%.  Many say this in jest, but I can truly say of this story that it changed my life.  Well done!

0143118420|3.0|Eat, Pray, Love is about discovering self, even if a monumentally self-absorbed self. For real contrast, try reading {[ASIN:0609809547 Tales of a Female Nomad: Living at Large in the World]] by Rita Golden Gelman. As Gelman said in an email recently, \\"The books are similar in that they're both about women, recently divorced, who take off on a search. Elizabeth Gilbert's one-year search for herself was primarily a search for her identity, an internal search. The fifteen years that I write about in TOAFN were about my search...mostly external...to learn about and participate in other cultures. My search was, and still is, for our common humanity. Our age difference probably had a lot to do with why we were exploring in such different ways....she was 34 when she started and I was 48. I knew who I was...but I did have to strip away some layers that had built up over the years...and I did explore my spirituality, especially in Bali.\\"    I liked Eat, Pray, Love. I *loved* Tales of a Female Nomad. This is a woman who knows how to make lemonade from lemons! Give it a whirl. It's addictive.

B002L3RVCY|5.0|I have recently watched Season One of The Clone Wars on DVD while, at the same time, reading The Official Episode Guide to see if I missed anything while I was watching. The DVDs are wonderful, and it has been great fun to watch the episodes again after seeing them originally on TV. Each episode includes a featurette showing director Dave Filoni and other key members of the production team talking about the development of the episode. All were very interesting. Also, a few of the episodes are presented as director's cuts, so they show some footage we have not seen before. Great fun. The package also includes a booklet showing drawings and pictures.<br /><br />The Official Episode Guide is also very useful. Each episode is covered separately with a synopsis, pictures, background information, and lists of the cast, characters, weapons, and vehicles. I found the book to be helpful if you read about each episode after watching them on the DVD.<br /><br />Then there is the Character Encyclopedia for Clone Wars. The book covers more than 200 characters and gives you a description, statistics, a picture, and specific background information for each. The characters are listed in alphabetical order so you can always look up a particular one you might be interested in. As is true with most Clone Wars items, the book has a great look to it.<br /><br />I am pleased that The Clone Wars series has been successful enough to spawn all of the books and the DVDs that have been issued. The quality of the packaging has been excellent, and I am optimistic that we have a great deal more to look forward to.
B0031Y9DCS|5.0|I first read Bob Mason's Chickenhawk over 20 years ago when I was a graduating high school senior getting ready to begin my first year of Army ROTC at college.    You won't find many books with the level of detail and smooth readability like this one. Mason has a way of breaking complex, technical aspects of flying helicopters to the layman, and when you read other Vietnam memoirs, you discover that there aren't many with the depth of thought, quick pace and white-knuckle action of this classic.    I'm not an aviator, so I can't relate to the story like the pilots who read the book can, but as a career soldier and combat arms officer, I find this to be a valuable addition to any professional military library, not only for the fascinating perspective Mason provides on the Vietnam War, but also for the experiences he had returning from the combat zone and the difficulties he had coping with PTSD and the various unseen wounds he received from the relentless action.    Mason's writing puts you in the left seat of the UH-1 he flew during myriad missions combat and otherwise...and the tales he relates range from heartbreaking to hilarious.     This would have made a tremendous movie...a shame one was never made about his exploits with the Air Cav and later the \\"Prospectors\\" where the events ranged from the strange to the surreal.     If you have an interest in army aviation, the Vietnam War or are simply a military history enthusiast and you've not read this book, then do yourself a favor and pick it up.

B003A4IFGY|5.0|Yes, everyone! It's no reason to cry - this album is great, enjoyable to listen. There are very little or no gaps between tracks - they nicely flow into each other. This album is different from other Tom Petty's album. If I want to compare I think Mojo is better than 'Highway Companion' and just as good as 'Wildflowers.' My comments on the songs are as follows:<br /><br />'Jefferson Jericho Blues' - great opener, however, harmonica a bit annoying<br />'First Flash Of Freedom' - good song, but unnecessarily long<br />'Running Man's Bible' - very strong, one of the higlights<br />'The Trip To Pirate's Cove' - compelling, excellent lyrics<br />'Candy' - another masterpiece<br />'No Reason To Cry' - highlight!<br />'I Should Have Known It' - It rocks!<br />'US 41' - sounds like a Fleetwood Mac song - not a drawback<br />'Takin' My Time' - sounds like 'Joe'<br />'Let Yourself Go' - just a filler<br />'Don't Pull Me Over' - reggae, masterpiece<br />'Lover's Touch' - filler no.2<br />'High In The Morning' - another strong song backed by a great story<br />'Something Good Coming' - my favourite on the album, sounds like 'Southern Accents'<br />'Good Enough' - it's more than good enough

1932100660|5.0|Eighteen months ago I started on a 'food combining' diet to help with some really nasty digestive issues I had going on.  I immediately improved and that kept me on the diet...I love to feel good!  Now I have read and re-read \\"The China Study\\". I have marked all over the text and in the margins.  I realize that the reason I feel so good is because the food combining emphasizes fruits, veggies, grains, and seeds and minimizes meat and dairy.  Of course, the boxed stuff (in the center of the store) is out, but I never could see why you would eat that.  So now I am going vegan.  It will be gradual but I know it will be tasty and I am going to feel even better.  I mean, my posture has improved, my stamina is greater, my outlook is better, my weight is normal, my BMI is normal, my blood cholesterol is great, my blood pressure has gone down to normal.  I really feel sorry for people who are still eating hashed browns covered in a pool of melted cheese.  What are they thinking?!?!?  They say, \\"Oh, but it's soooo good.\\"  Of course it is...what's not to like?  But is it worth it?  I just bought 10 copies of this book.  I am going to give one to our library.  It is my Christmas gift this year.  I am sending one to everyone I can think of.  I wouldn't be surprised if I buy a hundred or more before it is over.  And I am reading all the related material too.  Thanks Dr. Campbell!  You have answered my prayers!  Now how do we get the word out to the rest of the country...the world?  We don't need health CARE reform, we need health INFORMATION reform.  The American people are smart.  If they have the info they need, they can make good choices and they can kiss those meds and procedures good-bye.
B001FB5634|5.0|I just rented this movie, have already watched it twice, and wow, what a powerfully emotionally moving movie it is, akin to \\"Eli\\", and actually I wondered if there was some sort of relationship with \\"Eli\\", cause Robert Duvall's charactor is named Eli.  Well anyway, this is a good turorial on good people versus bad people, and I suspect we all have encountered folks who would turn outrageously bad given no laws to restrain them, the sometimes so called \\"successful\\" folks, the supposed \\"winners\\" of society who are absolved of guilt if they turn out an old lady or family out onto winter streets if they are even a couple days late on the rent, cause hey, if its about money, anything goes it seems.  Only interesting point is most of those types of folks have no survival skills if they don't have money to purchase things, they either won't be in a post apocalyptic survival scenario, or they will take the easy route of cannibalism.    Eventually I would like to add this movie to my library, I mean, why wouldn't anyone, because of the excellent acting in the movie from every actor/actress, I mean, if a movie can almost drive you to tears, that is truly a movie experience, and I was similarly moved with \\"Eli\\".  I'll have to wait till it comes down in price, just like Eli.      Now, cannabalism is something that humans have been known to do throughout history, the chinese had a famine in the 1960's and it happened in its most rural hardest hit areas, along with it having been accepted throughout history in chinese culture where they could trade their children off to be eaten for food or eat them theirselves(I am referencing the book \\"Maneaters\\", a good reference for this type of thing, but they reference cannibals as predators in that book, it always seems children or women are snatched by cannibals.  Cannibalism happened in the Ukraine in the 1930's when Stalin had their crops destroyed to suppress opposition to communism.  I wouldn't want to be a cannibal, with all the modern diseases, to even include deadly brain diseases, not even cooking human flesh for more than five minutes at 140 degrees fahrenheit would get rid of that K-Jacobs brain disease(otherwise known as mad cow disease).    Some confusing points of the movie, like who was that man who shot arrows, was it the one they had just encountered(trying not to give spoilers).  Also, radiation, from fallout, I am sure it had to be bad but one really can't tell.
B001LF347E|4.0|I watched Merlin on American TV, not the BBC America channel.  Loved it.  Looked for it to be available on DVD.  Found it was only available in European format.  Waited some more.  Finally it was available.  Asked for it for my birthday. Got it. 5 DVDs.  Funny.  I didn't remember season one being that long.  It wasn't.    Discs 1 & 3 begin with LONG ads for (1) Robin Hood and (3) Dr. Who.  I'm used to ads on American movies, but it's always possible to skip them by going to the menu or some such.  No way here.  You CANNOT skip the ads.  I did mute the sound.  I might have to watch them, but I don't have to listen to them.  Only 3 episodes on discs 1,2,and 3. There are 4 episodes on disc 4 and NO episodes on disc 5.  I loved the series.  I love it still, and, even knowing what I do about British marketing bs, I'll still buy season 2 when it's available.  But I don't appreciate   \\"2 entertain\\"s (more like \\"2 ANNOY\\"s) blatent attempt to lure customers with the ad  \\"5 DVDs\\" when 13 episodes plus \\"special features\\" would be on either 3, or no more than 4 DVDs had the series been an American one.

1439181780|3.0|There are parts of this book which are definitely inspiring. It certainly makes you feel uplifted and creates a positive attitude, so that you feel stronger and more equipped to face the difficulties in your life. Rhonda Byrne helpfully reminds us that we have much more power than we think, and shows us how easy it can be to change ourselves and our lives for the better. However, The Secret benefitted from the input of a host of other authors, whereas here Rhonda Byrne tends to become a little repetitive. After a few chapters you feel you're reading the same thing expressed in slightly different ways. Also, there isn't a great deal of psychological insight - some of the advice on how to harness the power is rather simplistic. So the book is certainly helpful as a feel-good fix, but all in all it seems a little superificial, compared to other more serious books on spiritual awakening such as the Power of Now or How to Live in the Here and Now.
1439153663|5.0|I loved this book and can't wait for the next one.  I don't care if it's a sequel or not. As long as Grissom keeps writing the same way,  I'll be sure to be reading her books.
B000E1ZBGS|1.0|Friends of mine -- all of whom know my great love for the novel -- insisted I see this film, in spite of my firmly stated desire not to do so.  I finally caved this weekend.  Big mistake.  This movie bears only a vague similarity of character names and basic plotline to Austen's novel.<br /><br />Visually, the film was more than a disappointment, it was a calamity.  The characters looked greasy, unkempt, and dirt poor.  I thought \\"Am I watching Cold Comfort Farm? Are there pigs in the drawing room?  What IS this? And would someone please, PLEASE comb their hair!\\"  Costumes, sets, everything was far more suitable to a steampunk version of a Bronte mashup than a Regency period piece.<br /><br />In terms of character, one of the things everyone said to me was \\"OMG, it captures the passion underlying the novel!  You must see it!  Flail, flail, flail!\\"  Well, actually, no, it didn't -- if throbbing passion actually underlies Pride and Prejudice (which I've never noticed it to do).  I thought Darcy and Elizabeth had little to no chemistry.  She seemed peevish the entire film, and he simply looked confused and indecisive.  No less baffled was Donald Southerland -- whom I hugely admire and respect -- in his turn as Mr. Bennet: a sad, defeated, broken man...definitely not something I'd ever read in the novel.  Georgiana, to my shock, was actually pert. PERT. I was speechless.<br /><br />Judi Dench, god bless her, was in a completely different film.  I really wanted to see that film.  Badly.  Unfortunately, I wasn't watching it.<br /><br />I won't comment much on the dialogue, as I know cramming a huge novel into two hours is a fairly impossible task, but to actually have Charlotte Lucas say \\"Don't judge me, Lizzie, don't you dare judge me!\\", or Elizabeth blurt, \\"Mr. Darcy, what are you doing here!\\" when she sees him at Rosings is so far beyond the pale, that the palings aren't even in sight any longer.<br /><br />Perhaps I was missing the director's, the actors', the designers', and the writers' point in this film, but all I felt I was missing was \\"Pride and Prejudice.\\"<br /><br />In a word: dreadful., but all I felt I was missing was \\"Pride and Prejudice.\\"    In a word: dreadful.
B0000069CT|5.0|Bruch's \\"other\\" works for violin and orchestra are currently rather well served on disc, and deservedly so - while none of them quite challenges the famous first concerto for sparkle and easy flow of compelling melodies, all the works here are at least very attractive and well worth getting to know. Importantly, Salvatore Accardo is a violinist of the first rank and plays with a warmly shimmering tone, beautiful phrasing and impeccable technique - even his rendition of the first concerto must rank among the very best on disc, and he is excellently accompanied by the sensitive, rich and full-bodied tone of the Leipzig Gewandhaus Orchestra under Kurt Masur. The sound quality is spacious and well-defined as well. The drawback of this set, if there is one, must be that it fails to include all of Bruch's works for violin and orchestra, such as the Romanze op.42, the Adagio appassionato op.57, the In Memoriam op.65 and the Konzertst&uuml;ck op. 84. The reason is obvious, however - the two discs here clicks in at 78:46 and 78:26, respectively, so there would hardly have been room for another work (besides, these works appear on the companion disc containing Bruch's symphonies).<br /><br />Some words on the less familiar pieces are in order, I guess (the first concerto and the gorgeous Scottish Fantasy are sufficiently well-known to most readers I suspect). The second concerto is darker and more dramatically intense than the first. It contains some stirring details and interesting orchestration, but is on the whole less compelling than its predecessor - the melodic material is, while interesting enough, never on the level of no.1. The third is richly lyrical with a wonderful first movement (containing some fabulous writing for the soloist) and a hugely attractive tarantella finale; only the middle movement is a little heavy going. The Serenade op.75 is, at 40 minutes in duration, the most extensive work here, but is hardly as formally concentrated as the concertos. It is another melodically compelling work, the material is only intermittently in danger of outstaying its welcome. All in all, though, this is an excellent set that should appeal to any lover of romantic music; strongly recommended.
B002ZG98ZA|1.0|This is the worst movie I've ever seen in my life.  No plot, bad acting, no plot, full of fashion mistakes and menopausal mishaps....oh, and no plot.  Let me sum up this movie:  Talking, talking, talking, Middle East, talking, talking, New York, and more pointless talking.  Complete trash.

B001P9EQH8|3.0|If you need your MP3 player to go up to 11 then this is the perfect companion! I recently got a motorcycle and some helmet headphones but my MP3 player was just too quiet. I got the FiiO E5 and it did increase the volume but not as much as I was expecting. I still use it but I might have gone with the E3 knowing now what I know since it is half the price and uses a AAA. The batt in the E5 lasts a long time, but once it is out you need to get to a computer with a USB to charge it, where as my MP3 player is a AAA and all i need to do is swap it out, and the E3 is AAA as well.    I tried to use it when plugging the MP3 player into my car system but for some reason it actually REDUCED the volume... that was weird and I am still puzzled with this, and since the MAJOR reason why I bought it was to make it so I didnt need to crank the stereo (so when I go back to CD it doesnt blow the speakers) it made me sad.    It is smaller than the E3 and has a clip which makes it pretty convenient, but after a while I just stuck everything in a bag anyway so that doesnt make much of a difference now.    I am not unhappy with the purchase and it is a good product, I just feel the E3 would have been a better fit with how I use it.

B002ZG997C|3.0|This is a movie made in the spirit of other movies not the spirit of reality. That's OK. Its entertaining because it indulges in well proven tropes. So kick back, put your brain in neutral and enjoy.<br /><br />The very first thing on screen is the cat. Most of the reviewers refer to it as a feral cat. In fact it's a purebred sphynx cat. This is a hairless breed that has a lot of health problems. It certainly couldn't survive in the wild today much less in the chilly post apocalyptic future. But that's OK. It immediately signals to the audience that this is just a fantasy.<br /><br />Denzel is of course an old man. In real life he's in his late fifties and he looks it. Before modern medicine the life expectancy was about thirty six. In a post apocalyptic world old men like him would have a hard time just staying alive. One little scratch could lead to a terminal infection. But it's OK. It is possible for an occasional old man to survive, if he was careful.<br /><br />But of course Denzel isn't careful. He has a tendency to find himself surrounded by groups of armed men intent on his destruction. He seems incapable of recognizing danger soon enough so as to avoid a face to face confrontation. But it's OK, Denzel is a great swordsman and pistolero and archer etc...<br /><br />In movies samurai style sword fighting is the most effective. In reality of course the Samurai were never successful in battle against anyone other than a Samurai and the Samurai sword was a lousy sword. But it's OK, Samurai style sword fighting may not be effective but it is certainly cinematic.<br /><br />Later Denzel is surrounded once again by adversaries - this time with guns. Then Denzel eschews his sword and pulls out his pistol and shotgun. You might wonder why in his previous encounters he had endangered himself by fighting masses of armed men in close quarters when he could have shot them from a distance. Saving ammo? But it's OK, not only can no bad guy cut him with a sword, ax or chain saw, no one can hit him with a bullet either. Ray Stevenson the top bad guy fighter who shoots apparently without regard to scarce ammunition can't seem to hit Denzel in the back from twenty feet - twice.<br /><br />Later yet Denzel shoots two baddies with his bow. You might think that he finally has decided to save ammunition, but no. He doesn't bother to retrieve his arrows but leaves them in the bodies for Gary Oldman to discover shortly. But it's OK, his bow is a ridiculously weak one. Even the small young woman tagging along can destring it with one hand.<br /><br />Next Denzel and the girl meet the cannibals (all such movies have cannibals). You might wonder why like Clint Eastwood in The Unforgiven someone doesn't just raise pigs. Not sure about that but like almost every other such movie the amazingly lethal action star wanders around in the desert and sooner or later meets some cannibals. But it's OK, Gary Oldman shows up and shoots the cannibals saving Denzel the trouble. Gary arrives with four Mad Max style DIY tanks. His most powerful weapon is somehow a Civil War vintage Gatling Gun - for which he apparently has plenty of ammunition.<br /><br />It's more than a little odd that there in this dystopian future everyone is armed with old weapons. Denzel has a WWII vintage canteen. Although he talks a lot about water both he and the girl seem to be able to hike across the desert for days sustained only on the one quart capacity of this canteen. Neat trick. But it's OK they also have WWII vintage grenades which somehow are incredibly powerful yet never endanger the thrower with shrapnel.<br /><br />The whole Bible trope was better done in \\"A Canticle for Liebowitz\\". Indeed the critics seem to be divided between those who think this movie is anti-Christian and those think it's a fundamentalist religious rant. But it's OK the book thingee is obviously just a McGuffin - as Hitchcock once explained - an arbitrary device that motivates the action. It's nice it it makes some sense in the plot but not that's not really neccesary.
B00192KCQ0|3.0|Metallica makes another failed attempt to reclaim their long lost place in metal history as the world's top metal band,and in the process, sells out for a second time in their careers... this time,to themselves.I get the feeling that for this album they were doing metal just because it was trendy again,not because it's what they wanted to do.I Really did like this album a lot when it was first released,but it has turned out to be a reverse-grower for me,and i realized that the only reason i cared for it at all was nostalgia..the lyrics are juvenile,insipid and weak,james hetfield's voice is long shot,lars..well it's lars- basic novice drumming at best.Generic metal songs that are way too long, poorly pasted together with pro-tools..in this regard death magnetic is closer to st.anger take-two than many metallica fans would care to admit.I guess i was just expecting more being an original old-school metallica fan(since the 'puppets days)..three stars for \\"all nightmare long\\" though..great song,so is \\"that was just your life\\".the rest..meh,which is how i see the rest of the album..mediocre at best ,no more,no less.that's four less than stellar studio albums in a row now,metallica,no more money from me!!!these guys used to be great,WHAT THE HELL HAPPENED???!!!Did i mention the production SUCKS!!!??Oh well,maybe next time..(been saying that for 20 years now about this band!)
B002RWKSII|5.0|There are many great things about this album, but one of the best Brian Wilson doesn't treat these great American songs with piety it's clear that he loves and respects the Gershwin legacy, but he's not intimidated by it, and he's certainly not afraid to \\"reimagine\\" this material through the filter of his own sun-kissed, lysergic sensibilities.<br /><br />Some highlights: \\"I Got Rhythm\\" sounds like a long-lost Beach Boys cut.  \\"Someone to Watch over Me,\\" with its sonic echoes of Wilson's classic \\"Caroline, no,\\" joins the very top echelon of this Gershwin standard's multitudinous recordings (hello, Frank Sinatra!).  \\"It Ain't Necessarily So\\" indicates that Brian listens to Tom Waits; he puts something of a snarl into the already acidic lyrics.  The instrumental \\"I Got Plenty o' Nuttin'\\" just puts a big grin on one's face, especially once that bass harmonica kicks in.  And \\"The Like in I Love You,\\" one of the album's two Wilson-completed Gershwin fragments shows Brian still at the top of his composing and arranging game -- he remains one of the best in American history.<br /><br />My only quibble with the album is its brevity.  Wilson leaves us wanting more, as any entertainer should, but I would like to have heard a more fully worked-out \\"Rhapsody in Blue,\\" perhaps with him on the piano parts and his band singing his brilliantly-arranged (acapella on the album) choral part.<br /><br />Brian Wilson fans are going to love this; George Gershwin fans are going to love this; aficionados of well-crafted pop music in general, and of the Great American Songbook in particular, are going to love this.<br /><br />Album of the Year?  A little too early to tell, perhaps, but...

0375507256|5.0|In a summer when the Stern Librarian started but could not finish novels by Faulkner, Flaubert, Michener or even Justin Cronin, I began to wonder if I was through with Circulation and should just go to law school.  Then I gulped down Cloud Atlas and redonned my robes as a vestal in the temple of the novel.  Even though it was published several years ago, and takes place in times remote from our own, I constantly felt this book mirroring and commenting on the world around me: when I listened to developments about North Korea in news, made a furtive visit to the Golden Arches, or spoke to a senior citizen Patron.  The narrative structure is ingeniously compelling, and the use of several genres in the same novel is sort of like having your favorite food cooked in six different ways by a great chef.  While some characters draw more admirers among readers than others, you can't help but debate who is \\"real\\" or fictional, or which ones share the same soul (or beauty mark).  It's so much fun that you almost don't realize until afterwards that Mitchell has written the greatest novel about economics of our time.  I know that the favorite character of most people is Frobisher, but I like the fabricant Somni, and will never forget her ascension brought about by library books, nor her malaise when she realizes that true exaltation comes not from literature but from experience and love.  The Stern Librarian vacationed in Hawaii this summer (don't worry, jealous Patrons, it was not my honeymoon) and this brought a special, personal piquancy to the crucial role of Hawaii in the novel.  The Stern Librarian (just one of the Matryoshka dolls in my nest of identities...)
B000A88EVE|2.0|Having read the book before seeing the movie, I was incredibly disappointed. The film completely over-sexualizes everything, completely changing the point of the story. It's pretty obvious in the book that the main theme of the novel is alienation. A big part of manifesting this theme was the fact that Thomas Newton was basically asexual. Betty Jo (whose name is inexplicably changed to Mary-Lou in the film) is clearly interested in Newton, but he is completely apathetic to her advances. By making a (very, very) prominent sexual relationship between Newton and Mary-Lou, Nicolas Roeg is making the concept of isolation less important. It's the exact same case with Dr. Nathan Bryce; in the novel, Bryce is a disenchanted, middle-aged college professor who sees movies by himself and wears tweed suits. In Roeg's film, Bryce is a disenchanted, young college professor who has rape-fantasy sex with his attractive female students. Once again, Roeg trades Tevis' theme for sex. Roeg also alters the ending. Here's a SPOILER ALERT. In the novel, Newton's eyes are X-Rayed even though he tries to tell the doctor he can see X-Rays. The doctor ignores him, and Newton is blinded. Later, when Bryce finds the blind, partly drunk Newton sitting in a bar, Newton offers him a large sum of money-- which he accepts. In the film, Newton's eyes are X-Rayed and he tries to stop the doctor. The doctor does it anyway and we see Newton's pain, but for some reason he is not blinded. When Bryce meets Newton in what looks like a rooftop cafe, he is neither blind nor intoxicated. And most importantly, Bryce doesn't want his money.  If you haven't read Walter Tevis' novel, you may love this movie. Maybe if you've read it you might love it as well. But don't expect it to be as heart-wrenching. Don't even expect it to follow the plot.
B003NHRIVQ|3.0|The Last Song marks Miley Cyrus' first foray outside the Hannah Montana role and it is a good first step for this new star. However for those who have read the book will this adaptation of the book a little dissapointing. The heroine Ronnie progresses from an angry teenager to a strong caregiving person in the book something this movie has totally ignored. Instead the mushy love affair between Ronnie and Will is placed as the main theme of the movie.<br /><br />The main theme of the book is about forgiveness and again this is not clearly focused in the movie.<br />The producers could have focused on Ronnie being the caretaker to her ailing father and mentor to her brother which was the main focus at the end of the book. If this was incorporated into the script, Miley's first adult role would really be a great breakout role (something like Kristen Stewart in Into The Wild), but alas the producers prefer to focus on the mushy love affair to attract the post Hannah crowd.<br /><br />No explaination was given on why Ronnie is so angry with her dad (which could have been shown as a flashback and effectively giving an emotional presence to the movie) and Marcus was totally written off the movie. Kelly Preston was really wasted in this movie. So sad.<br /><br />The Last Song could have been a breakout role to Miley Cyrus something like A Walk To Remember to Mandy Moore. Alas, this movie ends up as another Saturday Afternoon Matinee.
B003TZ9EGO|2.0|Lady Gaga just does it better! There was not a single remix that was better and only Bad Romance came close to Lady Gaga's performance. If you really want the best performance, buy the original albums or wait for a greatest hits album from the Lady herself.
0060557818|3.0|I picked up Neverwhere after reading and enjoying Good Omens. I must say, though-after all the acclaim that Gaiman has received as a fantasy writer-that I expected a lot more.     Gaiman's London Below is an interesting and original setting for a novel. It isn't easy to create a new fantasy 'verse, and I particularly enjoyed the rules that governed London Below's interactions with London Above. Or the few rules that Gaiman bothered to explain to us, that is. It is ambitious. That's about as much as I can say for this novel.    The characterizations were nonexistent. Door doesn't even rise to the level of a cliche-that would require at least the shadow of a personality. She never manages to become more than just a few bland words in typeface. She had no voice. Instead she was so generic that I could never imagine what she might say next, yet was never actually surprised at anything she said or did.  I still have no idea who she is or who Gaiman intended her to be as a character. I can only imagine that Gaiman meant her to come off as somewhat sympathetic, what with her tragic past and all, but she is so completely lacking in the human element that I was more irritated with her than anything for taking up so much hyper-generic screen time. And another character, Hunter, is a bland and stereotyped as her name. The protagonist himself is only marginally more realistic. I felt when reading this novel that I had no one to connect to, and I never began to care for the characters or their quest.    Gaiman's biggest failing is that he tried to do too much and spread himself too thin. In this case, less really would have been more. It would have been better if he had focused his energies on one or two well fleshed out protagonists, rather than create a menagerie of extraneous cardboard cut-outs. The same can be said of the world he created-it would have made for a more compelling novel if he had shown us perhaps a little less of London Below and focused instead on fleshing out that bit as much as possible. Instead the glimpses he shows us never really scratch the surface of his deep underground world. We are shown a market, or a bridge, or a train and then whisked away again to some other aspect of the underground without ever getting any understanding of the inner workings, or the culture, or the significance of that we've just seen.    All in all, I found this novel to be lacking and ultimately forgettable. I guess you can say that one of the positive sides of it is that it leaves a lot up to the readers' imagination, and a lot of readers seem to not mind or even enjoy that aspect of the novel. Still, in my opinion Neil Gaiman's vagueness hinders his attempt to build a believable fantasy world, or an adventure the reader can be drawn in to.
0007202075|5.0|This version, as read by David Suchet, was amazing. He does all the voices with expertise and I greatly enjoyed the rendition. It sounds more like a radio drama than a simple reading.
1400052173|5.0|Should be required reading in every high school biology class.  Should be required reading in every high school English class.  Should be required reading in every high school social studies class.      The best book that I've read in a long time.  This will stick with me forever.    There is so much to learn from this story.    Read it.

B002RWKSII|5.0|Another triumph from Brian Wilson!  Listening to this collection, I can almost see Ira and George Gershwin in my mind's eye on the beach in California with surfboards under their arms.    From the opening intro (Rhapsody in Blue), through to its terrific reprise, the listener is treated to creative arrangement of Gershwin tunes that only Brian can apply!    Thanks, Brian!    Most strongly recommended!
B000002I6T|5.0|This album is the summary of the whole hippy-alternative-folk-rock-psychedelic era that appened in '60's: not only bacause of the beautiful music, but because there were all the main figures of the time: Jorma Kaukonen, Jerry Garcia, Grace Slick, Jack Cassady, Neil Young, Graham Nash, Joni Mitchell, and many others.<br />There isn't a highlight: all songs are truly beautiful, but my personal favourite is \\"Tamalpais High (At About 3)\\", with those psichedelic vocals, but most of all, the GREAT GUITAR SOLOS BY JORMA KAUKONEN, MY FAVOURITE GUITAR WORKOUT!<br /> A must have CD. BUY IT!!!
B003IPC5UC|5.0|This cd was received amazinly fast. I would def. order from this co. again A++++
B00028U6B8|4.0|Infact this album explains us the situation that Jefferson Airplane was living in the 1969 period: infact on traks like \\"GOOD SHEPERD\\" you can see that the Jack Casady-Jorma Kaukonen combo was increasingly removing from Jefferson Airplane politic mission, and the fact that Marty Balin not writes any song, makes we think that he was not very interested on making music with them.<br /> And of course this album mixes a lot of Jefferson Starship sound on albums like \\"BLOWS AGANISTS THE EMPIRE\\" or \\"SUNFIGHTER\\" and Hot Tuna sound on albums like \\"BURGERS\\"<br /> Anyway, I love this album because when I went to see a Jorma Kaukonen's show, here in Italy, he signed up it!
B00006WKY9|5.0|too me the best metal is like this melodic and well written. Songs like 'he's a woman , she's a man'  and 'sails of charon'  just stand the test of time and their clarity and power remains sharp. And of course klaus can just wail on vocals and he does here so completely.  The scorps by this point had come along way from their initial release 'lonesome crow' and it's good follow up 'fly to the rainbow'  , the classic 'virgin killer' and 'in trance' and shown the world that this band was one of the best metal bands out there and it still rings true.  I only wish that they'd play some of this stuff live.  I saw them in okc with msg and they didn't and I will see them again 8/17 in denver , co. But this chapter in their career deserves to be remembered also because the roth era was one of great songs and powerhouse songs that are well structered and very melodic.  The extra tracks help but I am still waiting for the band to release their two german sung songs they did from this period. both were covers of the sweet the songs were 'fox on the run' and 'action'. Sung in german they remain unavailable on cd anywhere.  They could have been good bonus tracks on this one too.  Anyways may melodic metal (not hair metal that is a stupid term) return to rule the metal scene. thrash and doom are tiresome.  And this one remains at the top of the seventies output in quality metal.
1441866868|4.0|This is a review for the audio book version, so I am going to break it down into three parts:  Writing, Performance, and Technical.<br /><br />First, the story.  The Windup Girl is a great post-apocalyptic novel about a world where genetic manipulation has backfired into plagues that have almost wiped out the human race and much of the natural world.  Bacigalupi has painstakingly created a vocabulary for this culture with words that sound realistic and technical like Sibiscosis, ivory beetle, gene-rippers, kink-spring and so-on.  This adds a rich texture to the story that makes you feel like you're there.  The characters are multi-layered.  Heroes become villains.  Villains become heroes.  He does a very good job and giving each character distinctive qualities that go beyond looks and mannerisms--we feel their motivations.  Having heard the book, I now want to read it so that I can see the spellings of the names and the terms.  Overall a great companion to other books in the genre.  If you like Dune, Oryx and Crake, and 1984, you will likely love this book.<br /><br />Second, the performance.  Jonathan Davis is GENIUS.  He was so good that I have a difficult time distinguishing if the book was actually that good, or if it was his performance that brought the characters so much to life.  Every character had it's own voice that varied just slightly from his normal speaking voice.  They were unique, but not annoying.  His pronunciation was clear, and his timing was perfect for drawing out suspense.  His dialogue had the cadence of a real conversation.  If I could give the performance section of this audio book 6 stars I would.  It is worth buying the book just to listen to Davis read.<br /><br />Finally the technical.  The authoring of this CD collection is bizarre.  There are 16 discs with at total if 1,584 tracks.  Importing it into iTunes is a nightmare, and then keeping track of where you are is just plain weird.  Chapter breaks can be found in the middle of tracks.  Chapter 2 starts in the middle of track 97.  Chapter 3 starts in the middle of track 59.  The discs end in the middle of chapters with an annoying voice that says, \\"This is the end of disc number...please continue listening on disc number...\\".  Every other audio book that I've heard has the tracks broken up by chapter.<br /><br />A piece of advice, so that you don't end up with 1,584 individual tracks:  When importing into iTunes, follow these instructions:<br />Stick the disc in your computer<br />When asked if you would like to import, click \\"no\\"<br />Select all the tracks on the disc<br />Go to \\"Advanced\\" in the menu bar<br />Select \\"Join CD tracks\\"<br />Then click import CD.<br /><br />In this way you will only end up with 16 hour long tracks.  The chapter breaks will still be lost in the middle, but your library will stay more organized.<br /><br />Overall, a great story, and a great performance.  Definitely worth a listen if you don't mind the weird technical presentation.he middle of track 97.  Chapter 3 starts in the middle of track 59.

B003EV6DBM|4.0|Though I've only seen two of the last three episodes of this Fifth Series (the last episode 'disappeared' from my download queue before I could watch it), I was oddly pleased and impressed -- it was quite enjoyable, even more 'serious' somehow, tho' the new Doc appears goofier and the plots were goofy, as always. But somehow Matt Smith, who is a terrific actor, injected some gravitas into the Doctor, while looking and acting, well, pretty goofy. Hard to explain, but it seemed like there's a more serious person in charge, everyone is taking the wackiness more seriously, and there's a new, more grown-up feeling to the whole thing. Which is a good thing. I recommended to two friends that they take another try at the series, which they had previously rejected as too childish. There's a difference between enjoyable goofy and puerile, and this new series appears to fall on the right side of the line. Congrats to the new guys!
B003F3NDOE|5.0|\\"UGLY BETTY\\", a series that captured the attention of millions of viewers with its heartwarming and hilarious storyline and it helps that the series is an adaptation of the popular Colombian telenovela \\"Betty la fea\\" by Fernando Gaitan. The series revolved around Betty Suarez (America Ferrera, \\"The Sisterhood of the Traveling Pants\\" films, \\"Lords of Dogtown\\"), a woman with a kind heart and is always giving. The problem is that she is not fashionable, known for her thick hair, eyebrows and big glasses and braces.  And now the series which won Emmy, Golden Globe and Peabody Awards bids its final farewell with its fourth and final season.<br /><br />In Season 1, audiences got to see how the unfashionable Betty got a job at the high fashion publication Mode Magazine and work as an assistant for Daniel Meade (Eric Mabius, \\"The L World\\", \\"The O.C.\\", \\"Eyes\\")., the Editor-in-Chief. Despite her looks and how badly she is treated at the workplace, Daniel sees the kindness in her heart and she manages to reach out to him and help him through his troubles.<br /><br />The stories tend to focus on various storylines that revolve around Betty's world. Betty lives with her father, Ignacio Suarez (Tony Plana, \\"24', \\"Commander-in-Chief\\") who happens to be a God believing man and very protective over his family. Her sister Hilda (Ana Ortiz, \\"Boston Legal\\", \\"Batman: Gotchic Knight\\") who moves back at home with her son Justin (Mark Indelicato). They are a strong Latino family with Betty more proper, while her sister is more street smarts.<br /><br />At Mode Magazine, there is a bit of strife as behind-the-scenes Wilhelmina Slater (Vanessa Williams, \\"Hannah Montana: The Movie\\", \\"Boom Town\\", \\"South Beach\\") tries to find ways she can move up and own Mode Magazine and in Season 1, she goes after Daniel's father Brandon Meade (Alan Dale, \\"The O.C.\\", \\"LOST\\") and has an affair with him. Wilhelmina trusts her loyal assistant Marc St. James (Michael Urie) to do her dirty work. Meanwhile, Marc and receptionist Amanda Tanen (Becki Newton, \\"American Dreams\\") are like two peas in a pod as they gossip about those who work for Mode Magazine, constantly make fun of Betty but yet despite their trash talking, they somehow also end up getting closer to Betty. As for Betty, she can always depend on her friend and Mode Magazine costume designer Christina McKinney (Ashley Jensen, \\"Extras\\" and \\"Eleventh Hour\\") to go, if times are tough at work.<br /><br />In Season Two, Wilhelmina was doing anything she can to own Mode Magazine but her goal to marry Brandon Meade doesn't go quite well but she manages to have sex with him and gets pregnant right before he dies. Meanwhile we are introduced to Daniel's brother Alex turned woman named Alexis (Rebecca Romjin, \\"X-Men\\" films, \\"Pepper Dennis\\") who is like another rival to Daniel and we also meet his mother who just escaped prison, Claire Meade (Judith Light, \\"Who's the Boss\\"). Meanwhile, two men - Henry and Gio vie for Betty's affection and one asks her hand in marriage.<br /><br />In Season Three, we see Betty taking a more proactive approach in her job and trying to rise in the ranks of Mode but things get a bit crazy when her high school rival Kimmie (played by Lindsay Lohan) enters her life once again and takes part in the Young Editors Training Program (YETI). Meanwhile, Hilda's salon is doing well but the city shuts it down, meanwhile Cliff and Marc become closer and eventually want to marry or will they? As for Daniel and Wilhelmina, the two must work together in ensuring that Mode Magazine becomes profitable.<br /><br />In Season Four, Betty has now risen in her career at Mode Magazine and has become features editor.  But similar to how she had to prove herself as an assistant, now Betty must prove that she deserves to be a features editor despite many challenges including a jealous Marc who was also up for the job.<br /><br />Daniel is trying to deal with his wife's death and joins a support group which may be a cult.Meanwhile, Hilda must make a difficult decision in her relationship with Archie, especially when her old boyfriend Bobby enters her life.  Justin must deal with the prejudice he faces in high school and most of all, trying to find out about how to deal with his homosexuality and keeping it private or making it public.  Wilhelmina gets hooked into a coverup when her daughter Miko has returned and is accused of murder, while trying to deal with the disappearance of Connor.  And Claire wants to find the son that she had given up for adoption.<br /><br />\\"Ugly Betty - The Complete Fourth and Final Season\\" features 20 episodes on four discs.<br /><br />VIDEO & AUDIO:<br /><br />\\"UGLY BETTY\\" is presented in Widescreen (1:78:1) and is enhanced for 16×9 televisions. Production for \\"UGLY BETY\\" is quite slick and for a drama series, picture quality is along the same lines as abc studio's other DVD releases. Which is pretty good and compression artifacts and low light noise is not as visible.<br /><br />As for audio, \\"UGLY BETTY\\" is presented in Dolby Digital 5.1 Surround Sound. The series is front and center channel driven. Dialogue is clear, music is clear and overall, not a series to expect a lot of sound effects on your surround channels but for the most part, dialogue is understandable.<br /><br />Subtitles are in English SDH, French and Spanish.<br /><br />SPECIAL FEATURES:<br /><br />\\"Ugly Betty - The Complete Fourth and Final Season\\" includes the following special features:<br /><br />DISC 1:<br /><br />  * Deleted Scenes - Two deleted scenes which include \\"Connor Checked Out\\" and \\"Steam Room\\".<br /><br />DISC 2:<br /><br />  * Deleted Scenes - Three deleted scenes which include \\"I'm Available\\", \\"What is Level 5?\\" and \\"Breathe\\".<br /><br />DISC 3:<br /><br />  * Mode After Hours - Featuring the following Marc and Amanda \\"Mode After Hours\\" segments: Stress-Orcism (3:35), Role-Playing (3:26), Queenseeker (5:16) and Harassment of a Sexual Nature (3:39).<br />  * Deleted Scene - Featuring two deleted scenes: \\"Elevator Chatter\\" and \\"Male Models\\".<br /><br />DISC 4:<br /><br />  * Betty Goes Bahamas - (8:30) Behind-the-scenes of what the cast did during their stay in the Bahamas.

But most importantly, it's that ray of sunshine the series had brought to millions of viewers each week.<br /><br />Having watched the series since it first began, I've looked at \\"Ugly Betty\\" as a series that was not only well-written and well-cast but also a series that was important as it revolved around a Latino family and truthfully, there have not been many drama/comedy series on television featuring a lead character that is Latino but also a female, so in many ways, the series sure made its mark in American pop culture and it's a shame that the series was canceled (and several years earlier, the sitcom \\"The George Lopez\\" show which broke new ground was also canceled).<br /><br />\\"Ugly Betty\\" has been a wonderful series and although the ratings may have tapered off (as did other ABC drama series such as \\"Desperate Housewives\\" and my other favorite series now ended, \\"Lost\\"), this fourth season continued the drama, the fun that the show was known for.  I felt that this fourth season finally broke new ground for Betty as we have seen her advance in her new career and we finally see the braces come off, but what the writers were able to do is focus on the supporting characters.<br /><br />The fourth season dealt with Daniel's healing process after the death of his wife, we see Hilda dating a politician but then seeing how life had affected her after a one night stand with an ex-boyfriend, for years we have seen Justin grow in the series but wondered how the writers would handle his \\"coming out\\" and we watched the continued power struggle between Wilhelmina and Claire Meade.  As important as the series for Betty fans, the writers gave viewers the opportunity to watch each character grow and in some sense, every character was like family.

B002ZG9846|5.0|I don't get out to the theater much, so when I saw the positive reviews for the film adaptation of Kick Ass back in April of 2010 I decided to give the [[ASIN:0785134352 graphic novel]] a try. First of all, it was a fun, very quick read, because it was heavy on the \\"graphic\\" and light on the \\"novel\\". Lot's of well-drawn, \\"graphic\\", colorful images with blood spurting everywhere (as well as other bodily fluids).<br /><br />Now it's very rare that I say what I am about to say and many of the book's fans, Mark Millar fans and just plain old folks that disagree will call me blasphemous, but....The movie adaptation of Kick Ass is better than the comic book; um, I mean book; er, I mean graphic novel. Oh sure, the movie takes some liberties over what was originally drawn out in print. In my opinion a good movie adaptation of a book needs only to be as good as or better than the original author's ideas, and Director Matthew Vaughn pulled this off flawlessly.<br /><br />Don't get me wrong; the original story is mostly intact. Vaughn just takes the over the top, crazy-violent, captivating story of a teenager that dares to live out his dream of being a superhero to a new level in the film version. The story is very well written and flows superbly. Meet Dave Lizewski whose favorite pass-time is, you guessed it, comic books. Specifically, comic books with superheroes. And this kid's fantasy is, you guessed it, to be a superhero. So what do you think he does? (Okay, I'll stop saying \\"you guessed it\\" now.) He puts on a costume, calls himself Kick Ass, and he goes out looking for trouble. And he finds it.<br /><br />He also finds out that he's not alone in his fantasy world of kids gone superhero. Enter Hit Girl played by Chloe Moretz. Moretz's performance is a big part of what took Kick Ass from a 4-Star movie to a 5-Star movie for me. Moretz is no wimpy kid, and the girl she is in [[ASIN:B002ZG97G0 Diary of a Wimpy Kid]] is nowhere to be found in Kick Ass. She slices, dices and she does it with a smile. Okay, yes, it sounds morbidly disturbed to praise an 11 year old for chopping up bad guys with such a seemingly pleasurable disposition. But, man, that one scene where she chops, then looks over at Kick Ass with that little girl, new front teeth smile as if to say, \\"check me out, wasn't that cool,\\" only to repeat the same action a few more times unflappably just won me over.<br /><br />And the rest of the cast turn in A-List performances as well. Not just Aaron Johnson who plays Lizewski/Kick Ass, but the whole doggone cast...including Nicolas Cage as Big Daddy. Cage ain't no [[ASIN:B000OVLBIU Ghost Rider]] in this movie; he's a quirky, washed up cop that's out for revenge against a mobster who framed him in a former life, and Cage plays the role perfectly. While the character of Big Daddy is a bit different from the tough guy character in the book, it takes nothing from the story and I think that only a preservationist could disagree.<br /><br />Like I said earlier, the story is deliberately over the top and even pretty believable up until some of our heroes start to develop super strength in some situations...perhaps not super strength, but maybe super-resilient powers is a better way to put it. But the great acting, directing and flawless execution of every scene made up for any of the silliness that wasn't designed to be silly.<br /><br />This one goes on my shelf right next to some of my other favorite cult classic movies. If you're already a fan too and you haven't heard, there's a Kick Ass 2 planned for 2012, but I'd predict that topping the original will be about as successful as topping...well...you try to name a cult classic sequel that has ever outdone itself.

B003F3NDOO|4.0|In 2009, Bill Lawrence (co-creator of \\"Scrubs\\" and \\"Spin City\\") and Kevin Biegel thought about a TV series that revolved around single people in their 40's getting back on the dating scene and for Lawrence, said he was also inspired by his wife, actress Christa Miller (who also stars on the show \\"Cougar town\\", \\"Scrubs\\" and \\"The Drew Carry Show\\") and her life when she walked out of the shower, went in front of the mirror and flashed it.  By that action alone plus their ideas of featuring a 40-year-old trying to get back into the dating scene, the idea of \\"Cougar Town\\" was born.<br /><br />\\"Cougar Town\\" is a sexual comedy sitcom which revolves around Jules Cobb (played by Courteney Cox, \\"Friends\\", \\"Dirt\\", \\"Scrubs\\"), a 40-year-old divorcee who is a single mother raising her teenage son Travis (played by Dan Byrd, \\"Aliens in America\\", \\"Heroes\\") and also is successfully business owner who owns her own estate business.  Having been divorced for eight months, Jules now wants to have fun and enjoy life like a single woman would.  No strings tied, no relationships, just to have fun and most of all, having some sexual freedom in her life.<br /><br />But of course, she's learning quickly that entering in the dating game (and not wanting a relationship) at age 40 is not too easy, especially if your eyes are in younger men.<br /><br />Fortunately for Jules, she has a support system which includes her next door neighbor and best friend Ellie Torres (played by Christa Miller).  Ellie inspires Jules because she is married and has managed to make her marriage work.  Ellis is also a voice of reason and a friend she grew up with and since both Jules and Ellie tend to do everything together.  Ellie is married to Andy (played by Ian Gomez, \\"Rita Rocks\\"), who is a man that loves to eat, tries to be a good husband but also has lazy tendencies as well.  Together both Ellie and Andy are new parents and raising a baby and do all they can to keep their marriage happy and functioning.<br /><br />When Jules is not hanging out with Ellie, she hangs out with her young, promiscuous (and not-so-smart) assistant named Laurie (played by Busy Phillips, \\"Terminator: The Sarah Connor Chronicles\\", \\"Made of Honor\\").  Laurie is all about hooking up with men, having fun and despite not being a great assistant, Jules enjoys her company because she is part of the young single scene and hopes her assistant can take her to areas where she can meet younger men.<br /><br />And because Jules has friendships with both Ellie and Laurie and both woman are quite the opposite from each other, these ladies don't really get along but for Jules sake, they manage to hang out together for their good friend.<br /><br />Meanwhile, Jules is still close with her ex-husband Bobby (played by Brian Van Holt, \\"John from Cincinnati\\", \\"Threshold\\") who loves to party, drink beer, play golf, and is a custodian at his son's school and lives on a boat parked in a driveway.  Despite Bobby knowing why the reason he got divorced with his wife is because of his issues with infidelity, he does care for his ex-wife and wants to have some sort of relationship with Travis.<br /><br />Another man in Jules life is a man named Grayson Ellis (played by Josh Hopkins, \\"Private Practice\\"), a 40-something bar owner, who lives across the street.  Grayson irks Jules because young women constantly come out of his home (and Jules is jealous that its easier for older men to get back into the dating game compared to herself, an older woman).  But both because of their initial rivalry, Jules wants to be friends with Grayson and encourage him to join the neighborhood activities within the neighbors living in the cul-de-sac.<br /><br />Throughout the season, we get to see each of these people who are close to Jules, end up being close friends and are there for each other in times of need.<br /><br />\\"Cougar Town - The Complete First Season\\" features a total of 24 episodes presented on three DVD's.<br /><br />VIDEO:<br /><br />\\"Cougar Town - The Complete First Season\\" is presented in Widescreen (1:78:1) - Enhance for 16×9 Televisions.  For a DVD series, picture quality is good and with a lot of the series shot outdoors and inside with a lot of lighting, the series looks pretty good on DVD.  There are compression artifacts as expected from a DVD release but it's not that bad.  So far, \\"Cougar Town - The Complete Series\\" is a good looking TV series on DVD and fans of the show should be happy with its picture quality on DVD.<br /><br />It's important to note that Amazon has a listing for a \\"Cougar Town\\" Blu-ray release and if that is the case, I can imagine that this series would look fantastic on Blu, especially since the series has a lot of outdoor scenes.  Definitely a series that has the potential to show off quite a bit of detail and vibrant colors on HD.<br /><br />AUDIO & SUBTITLES:<br /><br />\\"Cougar Town - The Complete First Season\\" is presented in Dolby Digital 5.1 Surround Sound.  The series is primarily dialogue driven with occasional music and is primarily front and center channel driven.

To watch these cougars fawning over high school boys and watching Jules, a 40-year-old woman going to nightclubs where younger people frolic and then hanging out with students and playing beer pong was something I just had no interest in.  But I stuck with the series and sure enough, things got better.<br /><br />As the first few episodes did focus on the \\"cougar\\" aspect of older women going after young men, the series began to be more about relationships and friendships.  The series literally became much more fun to watch and easily a series that will appeal to both men and women.  I enjoyed how the series started to include more storylines that revolve around the people closer to her.  For example, her son Travis is constantly being embarrassed by Jules and his father Bobby and friends.  But he's a graduating teen who wants to lose his virginity and it's interesting to see how he goes about that and also tries to take advice from his father, his neighbor Andy and Laurie.<br /><br />Meanwhile, the Torres family are hilarious to watch.  Ellie and Andy have a fun relationship, especially how they plan their daily lives with each other.  May it be taking care of a child to planningtheir sexual nights.  But of course, as Ellie is a big support for Jules, Andy on the other hand is like the comedic character as he tries to be the confident man who knows about women in front of Travis and also becomes the follower when it comes to him hanging out with Bobby and Grayson.<br /><br />Meanwhile Grayson is the guy who loves to be with younger women but suddenly finds himself interested in Jules and Bobby, the ex-husband who is loud and obnoxious but also starting to noticed the woman he lost because of his infidelity problem.<br /><br />And then you have Laurie, your stereotypical blonde floozy who is just a promiscuous woman who just doesn't care.  She just loves to have fun and there's no stopping her.<br /><br />Also, this is role that suits Courteney Cox quite well.  As she was an actress that absolutely shined on \\"Friends\\", it's great to see her in a sitcom that is just fun to watch and also to see her character evolve. It's quite hilarious and you just have to love the hand \\"guns\\" and her \\"bing\\" chest bumps.  And as I enjoyed watching Courteney Cox, it was also great to see Christa Miller (who I absolutely enjoyed on \\"The Drew Carey Show\\" and \\"Scrubs\\") in the supportive role as Jules best friend.  Both Cox and Miller have great chemistry (as best friends) and to see both sitcom veterans together on one show is pretty awesome!<br /><br />Another element that I enjoyed with \\"Cougar Town\\" is the guest appearances.  It was cool to see Sheryl Crow play the wine client Sara who starts dating Grayson and also to see \\"Friends\\" star Lisa Kudrow playing the mean doctor and dating Jules ex-husband Bobby.  And now, hopefully we will see an appearance by another \\"Friends\\" alum on the show... Jennifer Aniston anyone?  Or even one of the male \\"Friends\\" characters.<br /><br />Overall, \\"Cougar Town\\" is a series with a colorful cast and I found myself enjoying the episodes more when they focused on everyone as a collective rather than always focusing on Jules.  And the fact that you have series creator and writer Bill Lawrence involved in the series, you do get that \\"Scrubs\\" adult humor type of feel when watching \\"Cougar Town\\".  Also, I liked how the series is contained within 30-minute episodes, it's easier to follow and much more easier to take in.<br /><br />The DVD release for \\"Cougar Town - The Complete First Season\\" is definitely enjoyable DVD release and you get all 24-episodes and a good number of special features.  So, fans of the series should not be disappointed.<br /><br />I admit that \\"Cougar Town\\" was much better than I expected and it's a comedy series that definitely caught my attention and will more than likely star watching it when the second season comes back on air.  For now, if you are curious about this series or are looking for a fun and hilarious adult-humored series on DVD, definitely give \\"Cougar Town - The Complete First Season\\" a try!the music of \\"My Sexuality\\".      * Ask Barb - The Ultimate Cougar Barbara \\"Barb\\" Coman (played by Carolyn Hennesy) answers questions in regards to being a cougar.

B000066744|4.0|An excellent and gripping tale with plenty for all - as someone else said, this really slipped under the radar.  A must see - for me, a most have.
B003Q7B78S|4.0|A genderbending film that pays its respect to Virgina Woolf's original work.  Sensually witty and highly enjoyable!<br /><br />English author, essayist, publisher Virginia Woolf, was a key figure in modernist literature.  As a woman who was inspired by avante garde which influenced her original work, she was a woman who was not only intellectual but a woman who was an individual that walked the beat of her own drum.  From being married to a man and having an affair with aristocrat and English author/poet Vita Sackville-West.<br /><br />In 1928, Virginia Woolf wrote a semi-biographical novel based on the life of Vita titled \\"Orlando\\".  One of Woolf's most accessible novels and eventually a novel that would receive its film adaptation in 2008 courtesy of writer/director Sally Potter (\\"The Tango Lesson\\", \\"The London Story\\", \\"The Gold Diggers\\").  The film would go on to receive a 1992 Academy Award nomination for Costume Design and Production Design.<br /><br />VIDEO:<br /><br />\\"Orlando\\" is presented in 1:85:1 anamorphic widescreen.  For a 1992 film, the latest DVD release for \\"Orlando\\" is not a huge improvement over its 1999 DVD release.  I know one of the problems that some people had with the original release was the amount of spotting and that the colors look a bit muted.<br /><br />I personally haven't seen the 1999 DVD release but with this 2010 DVD release, colors such as reds, browns and blacks are more pronounced.  There are some parts where colors do look muted and some areas looking a bit faded.  But I would imagine it's due to the film stock used around that time.  The film does manage to contain a god amount of grain but also has its share of low-light noise.  I did see some occasional dust while viewing but it was not plentiful.  Also, because there are a good number of lengthy special features included with the film on one DVD, I imagine that there would have to be some compromising in terms of picture quality.<br /><br />But as for the difference between the two DVD releases when it comes to picture quality, although I haven't seen the 1993 DVD, with DVD authoring having changed so much in the last decade that I feel confident that this 2010 DVD release of \\"Orlando\\" is much better than the previous DVD release nearly eleven years ago.<br /><br />I will say that with Sony Pictures Classics usually doing simultaneous releases for Blu-ray and DVD, I am surprised that \\"Orlando\\" is only being given a DVD release, because this is one film I would have loved to see an HD upgrade.<br /><br />AUDIO:<br /><br />\\"Orlando\\" is presented in English Dolby Surround.  The film is primarily center and front channel driven and for the most part, is mostly all dialogue.  There is a scene in which Orlando goes through a field where bombs are exploding and that is probably the major extent of action-based sequences.  But for the most part, dialogue is clear and the music and ambiance sounds do come clear through the front channels but I don't really recall the surround channels or LFE being utilized all that much.<br /><br />Subtitles are in English and English SDH.<br /><br />SPECIAL FEATURES:<br /><br />\\"Orlando\\" comes with the following special features:<br /><br />  * Select Scenes Commentary with Director Sally Potter - (10:17) Writer/Director Sally Potter does commentary for select scenes from the film.  The audio commentary is more like an interview with Sally Potter who explains why she made \\"Orlando\\" into a film.<br />  * Orlando Goes to Russia - (32:57) A documentary featuring Sally Potter going to Russia to film the 1610 time period for \\"Orlando\\".  This featurette is a video diary of producer Christopher Sheppard documenting Sally Potter and producers wanting to film in Russia and how the negotiations took place during the time of when Russia had just allowed film companies to start filming in their country and the two years of research and rounds of negotiations in trying to get parts of the film shot in Russia and the challenges the film crew had in trying to get the film shot in Russia.<br />  * Orlando in Uzbekistan - (51:53) A featurette about shooting in Uzbekistan and the challenges that arose during the filming in Uzbekistan and the expectancy of any Western company coming into the country to shoot a film is loaded with a lot of money and thus, people abandoning the country and wanting to renegotiate for more money from the producers and thus halting the film production.<br />  * Jimmy Was An Angel - (8:03) A featurette about a singer Jimmy Sommerville (of Bronski Beat and the Communards) who played an angel in the film \\"Orlando\\" and a behind-the-scenes look at the filming of that scene.<br />  * Venice Film Festival Press Conference - (23:08) Featuring the press conference that took place after the screening of \\"Orlando\\" at the \\"Venice International Film Festival 1992'.<br />  * An Interview with Sally Potter - (13:21) Featuring an interview with Sally Potter at the \\"Venice International Film Festival 1992'.  Potter talks about why she chose to do an adaptation of Virginia Woolf's \\"Orlando\\".<br />  * Theatrical Trailer - (1:16) The original theatrical trailer for the film.<br /><br />JUDGMENT CALL:<br /><br />Passion.  Immortality.  The chance to experience life differently and how the experience is everchanging.<br /><br />Virginia Woolf's \\"Orlando\\", a semi-biographical novel based on Vita Sackville-West, the woman that Woolf was intimate with, is truly a unique cinema experience and an interesting look at the treatment of women and their position in society during that era.<br /><br />Although written in a way in which many people at the time were unaware that this book was a semi-biography, I tend to look at this film (as based on the novel) as a story that is quite liberating.  And similar to how Orlando is shown through different time periods, I often wonder how people have perceived Woolf's most accessible novel during the various decades, especially the changes in how women are treated in business, politics and society but also to see how people perceived the character of Orlando and having had to experience life as a man and a woman and thus reading a book that does deal with sexual tendencies.<br /><br />I believe that Woolf who wrote the story in 1928 as a love letter to Vita broke new boundaries as a modernist but also in crafting a story that is fiction/non-fiction and writing without any constraints.<br /><br />All this is quite intriguing and to see how the very passionate writer/director Sally Potter giving great care in the adaptation of the novel and being persistent in trying to capture that feel and look by traveling to different countries and doing the necessary research in several years and making it happen.  Again, I haven't read the original book but having read reviews of people who have and feeling that Woolf did a remarkable job in her screenplay should show you how dedicated Potter and her producers were in bringing \\"Orlando\\" to life.<br /><br />Let me first tell you how remarkable actress Tilda Swinton was in this film.  To play an androgynous man and later a woman who experiences a lifetime of changes due to her immortality but to keep this straight face on and yet able to quickly deliver these humorous one-liners and seeing her react to the various characters around her was quite entertaining.  Billy Zane did a great job playing Shelmerdine and although short roles, Quentin Crisp as Queen Ellizabeth I and Jimmy Sommerville as an angel were well-done and brought a not-so-serious but subtle yet farcical feel to the overall film.<br /><br />As previously mentioned, I didn't own the 1999 DVD of \\"Orlando\\" but for those who have been wanting this film on DVD, you get a good number of special features included.  I definitely respected Sally Potters determination in making this film after watching these featurettes and knowing the challenges she and the producers had faced in filming in Russia and Uzbekistan.  Thereis a good amount of lengthy features included, the 2010 special edition DVD release has over 2 hours of never-before-seen extra footage (comparing to the 1999 DVD release, I see that four special features were included in the 1999 release but have a shorter duration than what is presented in the 2010 version).<br /><br />Overall, \\"Orlando\\" was an enjoyable film and I can see how anyone watching this film would see the incredible potential of actress Tilda Swinton.  Many have criticized the actress of her role as a man as unbelievable.  But my focus was not on the portrayal of man but the evolution of a person who has been both man and woman and trying to adjust to the changes that Orlando must face in a variety of time periods to the person's own immortality.<br /><br />The film captures your attention due to the detail that went into the costume and production design but its the witty one liners that come out of Orlando's mouth that I found humorous.  But it's the political satire of the film that I find most intriguing and Sally Potter did a great job in capturing that in her film.  \\"Orlando\\" is a film that is entertaining, humorous and truly captivating.  Definitely recommended.as a man and a woman and thus reading a book that does deal with sexual tendencies.    I believe that Woolf who wrote the story in 1928 as a love letter to Vita broke new boundaries as a modernist but also in crafting a story that is fiction/non-fiction and writing without any constraints.    All this is quite intriguing and to see how the very passionate writer/director Sally Potter giving great care in the adaptation of the novel and being persistent in trying to capture that feel and look by traveling to different countries and doing the necessary research in several years and making it happen.

B003NHRIUW|3.0|When it comes to Nicholas Sparks films, many can expect a romantic film that will literally have the audience laughing, crying and for the most part content with what they have seen.<br /><br />From films such as \\"A Walk to Remember\\", \\"The Notebook\\", \\"Nights in Rodanthe\\" and earlier this year with \\"Dear John\\", Sparks returns with \\"The Last Song\\" but interestingly enough, instead of a novel adaptation, Sparks wrote the screenplay for the film in which a novel was created right after the film was done.<br /><br />\\"The Last Song\\" is directed by well-known TV director Julie Anne Robinson (\\"Grey's Anatomy\\", \\"Weeds\\", \\"Samantha Who?\\") in her first theatrical directorial debut and the film would be known for bringing Miley Cyrus and current beau Liam Hemsworth together.  The film became a major box office success with a budget at $20 million and bringing in over $88 million.<br /><br />VIDEO:<br /><br />\\"The Last Song\\" is featured in 1080p High Definition Widescren (2:35:1).  Picture quality is good as their is a fine grain that can be seen on the overall print.  There are a lot of daytime scenes showcasing the colors of the blue beach and brown sand as well as the details of the foliage around the beach house and certain scenes in which colors such as reds and ambers really pop.  Night scenes feature dark blacks and for the most part, I didn't notice any edge enhancement, artifacting or DNR.<br /><br />AUDIO & SUBTITLES:<br /><br />\\"The Last Song\\" is featured in English 5.1 DTS-HD MA (48 kHz/24-bit) and a French language track.  The film is primarily dialogue driven and comes clear through the center channel while music and other sound effects can be heard through the front channels.  I didn't notice too much use of the surround channels during the film.  Possibly with crowd ambiance but really, this film is dialogue driven.  You do hear music once in awhile as Ronnie and Will are singing Maroon 5 or hearing Miley Cyrus' \\"When I Look At You\\" song.  But for the most part, this film is dialogue-driven.<br /><br />Subtitles are presented in English SDH, Spanish and French.<br /><br />SPECIAL FEATURES:<br /><br />\\"The Last Song\\" comes with the following special features in high definition, English 2.0 and subtitles in English SDH, Spanish and French:<br /><br />  * Alternate Opening Sequence: The Church Fire (With optional commentary by  director) - (2:55) A Blu-ray exclusive and the sequences is a more lengthy scene of the actual church fire which was trimmed down from three minutes to a few seconds.<br />  * Deleted Scenes (With optional commentary by director) - (7:09) A Blu-ray exclusive featuring five deleted scenes which include: Ronnie At The Piano, Steve & Ronnie At The Beach, Hospital Montage, Vegan Cookies, Juggling On The Pier.  There are certain key scenes which I felt that the director didn't trim out of the film.  Especially the first deleted scene.<br />  * Audio Commentary- A Blu-ray exclusive audio commentary with Director Julie Anne Robinson and Co-Producer Jennifer Gibgot.  Director Julie Ann Robinson sets up the scene of the film and the decisions that were made for the film.

The DVD is featured in English Dolby Digital 5.1 Surround Sound and a French language track, Widescreen (2:40:1) - Enhanced for 16×9 Televisions and is subtitled in English SDH, French and Spanish.<br /><br />JUDGMENT CALL:<br /><br />\\"The Last Song\\" is definitely a Nicholas Sparks film that captures the drama, the happiness of a relationship and the heartwrenching emotions that one can come to expect.  But one thing that \\"The Last Song\\" unfortunately doesn't have compared to his previous films is a strong dramatic actress.<br /><br />Before I get into Miley Cyrus, let me say that there talent who do make this film quite worthwhile. Greg Kinnear does a fantastic job playing the father, Steve and does a great job of not just the caring father but once the viewer learns about his secret and see how it changes him.  Just the overall transformation of Kinnear's character is impressive and for the most part, one of the his best performances that I have seen from the actor.<br /><br />I also have to say that the young actor Bobby Coleman who plays the young brother Jonah, also did a great job.  Some children are unable to capture the emotion of happiness and sadness and Coleman's performance as a happy and adventurous child is very good but when the story calls for him to be in the lowest of lows and most vulnerable, Coleman does a fantastic job!<br /><br />Although Kelly Preston is in the film, her role as Miley's mother is quite short but at least she is able to provide the stability for Ronnie toward the end of the film (and to think that the director originally cut that scene out from until Preston intervened).<br /><br />But what many people are wondering about this film is Miley Cyrus. Can she pull of a dramatic role?<br /><br />We've seen her play the sad Hannah Montana last year in \\"Hannah Montana: The Movie\\" and for those who have children or are familiar with her popular teen TV show, we know that she has been playing primarily comedic roles that don't require too much emotion.  The good is that her character Ronnie is a girl who seems displaced in Georgia, a young woman who has so much resentment towards her father and for the most part, Cyrus is able to capture Ronnie's emotions at that beginning first half of the film quite well.  To play a teenage girl who is stand-offish, rebellious and distant, she was able to pull it off.<br /><br />But then, during the second half, this is where the problems begin to happen.  Like many Sparks' films, his films are demanding on the actress.  And for the most part, the actresses on those films literally take command and their heartfelt scenes are dramatic and believable.<br /><br />As Mandy Moore did with \\"A Walk to Remember\\", Rachel McAdams did with \\"The Notebook\\" and Amanda Seyfried with \\"Dear John\\", Cyrus is not at that level as an actress.  What may work on her \\"Hannah Montana\\" TV shows or her film (which she did have an emotional scene) seems good for \\"Hannah Montana\\", but for \\"The Last Song\\", the emotions during those heartwrenching scenes don't seem as natural and free-flowing and comes off more like a staged execution of emotional display when the director yelled \\"action\\".<br /><br />As for Australian actor Liam Hemsworth, he did an OK job with the character of Will Blakelee but similar to Cyrus, where his experience is primarily TV-based, the more emotional scenes tend to escape him but at the same time, scenes of where he primarily plays the hunky guy around Ronnie and the flirtatious dialogue worked well.  And I will give both Cyrus and Hemsworth credit in that their onscreen chemistry worked well and it's good to hear that their chemistry extended to offscreen as well.<br /><br />\\"The Last Song\\" is a good film but it's a film that is marred by its pacing.  The execution of Nicholas Sparks' \\"Dear John\\", another film that deals with a short summer between a couple shows how a timeline plays a crucial part in the film.

B001N1DPDE|5.0|This is a very sturdy knife with a very thick blade.  Comes decently sharp, but I sharpened it even further.  I have not had a chance to do a lot with it yet, but so far I really like it.  Please note, I believe in using a knife like a knife and not a hammer or a pry bar.  If you need a hammer or a pry bar, use a hammer or a pry bar and don't be surprised if you damage your knife if you use it incorrectly.
014241543X|5.0|My thoughts: Even though tragedy strikes, If I Stay is not a novel about death but about life.     The story unfolds in two parallel levels: the present where Mia is in the hospital after the accident and the past, where through little snippets of flashbacks we get glimpses of Mia's life and memories. All the small, seemingly ordinary moments of her life, but which are truly the ones that one remembers when looking back on their life: the family barbeques, goofing around with her little brother, her first date and kiss and how she became best friends with Kim.    Gayle Forman's writing flows naturally and Mia's reminiscing has you turning the pages while losing all notion of the outside world and time.     One of the highlights of the novel are the strong characterizations: even the supporting characters leap off the page and the reader will remember even those minor characters who only made one chapter appearances (like Kerry and his unforgettable funeral memory).    The novel is narrated by Mia, who is a very serious young girl, more mature than her 17 years would let one presume. She is quiet but intense, focused and dedicated, loyal and genuine. She feels a bit out of place in her family as she has dark hair and eyes while her mom, dad and brother are all fair in colouring, they like rock and punk music while she is a classical music lover; but despite this sense of sticking out she deeply loves her family and feels best while with them. All the family scenes are fun and moving: the quiet affection and love shines through and it is clear this family has a great time even when doing mundane things.    Mia's parents are \\"cool parents\\": her dad was a musician and songwriter in a band until Mia's little brother was born and her mom was a rebel music fan/hippy, but even since they became \\"grown up parents\\", they kept this young, rebel, cool side of them and are still young at heart. All the light, funny banters in the car, at dinner, in the garden give a sense of this family better than any lengthy description could.    What I loved was how in spite of the shortness of the novel, If I Stay managed to show all the different facets of Mia's life: her life with her family, her grandparents, her best friend Kim, her boyfriend Adam and then of course with her great love: music. Mia's relationship to all these sides of her life was presented and laid out and the reader got a picture of what made Mia Mia. And I loved how these different facets of her life got equal importance and \\"screen time\\", that her friendship with Kim was not downplayed to leave more room for the love story with Adam, but rather how these different sides of her life were all interwoven.    I cannot highlight one part of the novel I liked better than the other, because Mia's love story with Adam was beautiful and touching, her friendship with Kim was funny and cute and her relationship with her parents and her little brother was heartwarming.     If I Stay is a wonderfully written and structured novel. All the flashbacks are meaningful and important, they have a role to support the present and show the reason behind Mia's indecision, feelings and doubts.    Verdict: If I Stay is a novel about choices, about decisions, about love. Because it is love that will ultimately sway the balance and make Mia decide either way. If I Stay is a moving and deep novel, and through the sad and heartbreaking loss of Mia it will still manage to make you feel alive and happy.    I absolutely loved If I Stay. It was a wonderful, emotional read, one I would definitely recommend for everyone. (It was also exciting to read that Gayle had no idea how If I Stay would end when writing the novel, that adds more to the thrill of the story.)    So imagine how happy I was when I saw that Gayle Forman is planning the sequel! Here is what she had to say about it: \\"It's called WHERE SHE WENT. It takes place a little more than three years later and it's told from Adam's point of view. And that's all I'm saying. It will come out in the spring of 2011 from Dutton.\\"    Plot: 8/10  Characters: 9/10  Ending: 8/10  Writing: 9/10  Cover: 10/10
B003AJKPL2|5.0|I never even realized this type of product existed until a couple of months ago when a friend brought one to a party!  I immediately ordered this one from Amazon and put it to the test.  This product is great.  It is very easy to use and it holds the cherry nicely for you so you don't have a mess.  I'd easily recommend this to anyone.

B001GCUNYO|3.0|Liam Neeson's characterization of a highly trained black ops operative desperate to retrieve his kidnapped daughter who is for sale as a sex slave is excellent.  He portrayed a wide range of emotions in the film and did them all well and is especially good as a father competing with his daughter's rich stepfather for her affections.  When he assumes his black ops persona, he has a subtle way of making you believe that he would tear your face off if necessary and move on impassively.  But two words kept popping into my head during every one of the film's action scenes:  JACK BAUER.  It's all there: the automatic weapon fire that always misses our hero until the obligatory non-fatal shoulder wound at the film's climax; the pistol fire the hero uses that NEVER misses; the impossible odds our hero always overcomes; the flaunting of every rule in the book and getting away with it; dozens upon dozens of bad guys dying by his hand, etc.  Taken is a well crafted thriller and Neeson is very good in his roll.  Had it been the first film of its genre I had seen, I would have boosted the rating.  By now, it's old hat.
0321687299|4.0|Great intro to HTML5. If you are new to web design, this isn't the book for you. But, if you want more than just a cursory introduction to HTML5, with good examples and plenty of links to further info on the web, this book is for you. Previous reviews cover the details quite well. Content is a solid 4 stars, bordering on 5.    My complaint is with the printing. As noted, it's horrible. I've looked at three copies of this book now, from three different sources. All have matte surfaces that haven't been applied well--they peel off and/or smear off if they get just a little wet. Interior color is brown and orange, but the difference between the two colors is so subtle that it's hard to tell them apart unless you view in plenty of light. This is bad because there are times the color of the text is used to indicate changes from one code example to another. Registration for the \\"color\\" printing is horribly off. More than half the color text is blurry. And again, this affects the code examples throughout the book.    In short, production values ruin what is otherwise a terrific HTML5 primer.
B001RIY4WE|5.0|I bought the skynet BD to replace the copyright 2000 T2 Ultimate Edition DVD I had . I can't imagine this film looking any better than this. It's a bit dated now from its 91 release and that's most noticeable in the vehicles IMO. The movie is an action classic though. The liquid metal terminator was high tech for its time. I chose to watch the 156 minute extended special edition, there were a couple scenes I didn't remember from before. Great movie @ a friendly price (thanks amazon). I want a \\"mini\\" gun now :)
B003JTHESA|5.0|Really dig the new Maiden.  It's not as catchy or immediately likeable as some of their other material, but opens up and is very rewarding after a few listens.    The acoustic intros are still here, but they are better integrated with the songs this time.  Thankfully the stupid repeated choruses are gone save for the title track.  Bruce sounds good to me.  Lyrics are well done.  Production is a bit muddy, and is really my only complaint.    Maiden really can't win when they release new stuff.  If it's all fast rockers they look like fools for abandoning their current style.  If it's all long songs folks cry out bemoaning it as being \\"boring\\".  Thankfully The Final Frontier is a good mix of the two.    Best of the reunion era material by far.  Up the Irons!

B000063UR1|5.0|SILENT RUNNING is a wonderfully quiet, calm sci-fi adventure in space. Bruce Dern is perfect as the conscience of the film, seemingly the only man left w/ a heart. Earth is in ruin, and Dern's character, along w/ three cohorts, is aboard the deep-space bio-dome, Valley Forge. With no forests remaining on earth, the Valley Forge carries the final greenery. Of course, something goes wrong, the mission is aborted, and the huge bio-domes are to be detonated. Dern disagrees, and takes lethal action to avoid the inevitable. SILENT RUNNING has that 70s \\"vibe\\" found in other films like IDAHO TRANSFER, 2001: A SPACE ODDYSEY, etc., a mood / atmosphere that exists only in that decade. Highly recommended...

0316067938|1.0|*Warning  possible spoliers*    The crazy thing for me is how much i just wanted to read this book despretly feeling like the twilight saga was just a normal peice of life. an for the time being i might have been what you called a regular twilight junkie. The only problem was when i got to this book all the entertainment had stopped an boring was taking its name. It was not knock me out broing, but rediculaous to the point you feel like there is no reason to read it.  Bella's hard-headed-ness just got ten times worse. Stephanie Meyer terribliy eneded the saga with more doors opened than closed to want to end something. She also turned Bella into someone that no one would want to be around-or relate too except older peopele- how she turned on jacob like it was no tommorrow. How she was over protective not metioning she just turned eighteen in reality to be acting like a 45 year woman. The baby was just the best worse instalment anyone could have made in a book. The fact that it makes it cool for older men to seek after children **Cough...cough...jacob**. Nothing was more worse than Edwards arupt change in behavior toward the whole chaging bella into a vamp thing...its like over night he's cool with it. Also i beleive that Bella and Edward were too obsessed with each other to have a child in the picture. Sometimes when Bella brought Nessie up then Edaward would just throw in any old comment rewarding Bella...really if you want to be an adult so bad then realize when you have a kid tht is your life an that was just passed off like it was such a fun thing to be a teenage mom and dad.  Also bella throwing away her life so quickly was dumb and dagerous. Being with a guy for etenity can change your mind on the way he/she really is.  Bella's mood swings only struck out a few of mine tht i had to force myself to finsh only to find out two guys want the heart of a child...  So i recommened never to even start the saga because when you read this book you will feel as if you wasted time and got a little to excited over something so dull and absurd.

0375507256|5.0|I am dumbstruck with love for this novel. In a way, \\"Cloud Atlas\\" may have ruined recreational reading for me, because it feels as if I have been reading the same books over and over and have finally struck upon something completely new and daring. And where will I find more of this kind of writing? Obviously I plan to consume everything David Mitchell has ever written. The structure of \\"Cloud Atlas\\" is of six nested novellas, each interrupted midway to proceed with the next, and each character in some way consuming the previous narrative - it is like candy for the mind. Exploring the take-home themes, that stronger groups enslave and unleash cruelty upon weaker ones, is tough going, but the final sentences brim with so much hope for mankind (or am I being naive? Was it a naieve hope?), I finished this book and pressed it to my lips for a kiss. Magnificent.
B003JTHETY|1.0|EVER FELT like you Can't Take Anymore (ANYMORE!) of Maiden's same old?     I'm sick of Bruce's inflections at the end of a lyric like in El Dorado, as in how he sings:     TEARS!   FEARS!   DEATH!   TOLD!   GOLD!     It's only marginally less irritating than Anton Maiden's works of art.     I'm tired of his whiny thin voice and operatic style. It's so difficult to hear him gasping Mooother of Mercy, then without pause go for the next line. Reminds me of the mouthful chorus for Montesegur. And he's not the only problem, just perhaps the most instantly noticable. The intro of Mercy is recycled from the intro of No More Lies. Here we go again...     I'm not against the new, precisely the opposite. All of it belongs to the past. That also goes for Dickinson's ponderous poetic quiet style of singing in Coming Home, and other places. Here's the old 'I'm only a soldier' schtick again.     Biggest overall album flaw: Lacks freshness as all the post-reunion material has. This is what the loyalist misses out on. They only note the fact that the melodies are new and haven't been done by Maiden before (that's because it is a new album), and admittedly there is more of a looser, less structured, what some might call \\"progressive\\" style. But all the Maiden trademarks that we heard a thousand times are here and makes me instantly tired and weary as the ancient mariner. It's just a few \\"new\\" ideas squeezed in with the old, a lot like new wine in old bottles. People have been playing the same 'progressive' ideas since the 70s and especially since the prog metal craze amongst naive listeners mostly in their teens/early twenties took off in the aftermath of Dream Theater.     A good example as any (or is that many) of Maiden sticking to the tired and true/old: The Alchemist - There are the hummable gallops (dum-de-de-dum, dum-de-de-dum), with Nicko plodding along, coupled with Bruce's strained old man howls, and a lame dual guitar riff. And still the 'true fan' will wet their knickerswith the glee of a five year old that's been allowed to stay up late.     Isle of Avalon ... somebody decided to be \\"progressive\\" again. Which means more barely recycled riffs, even recreating the break from SSOASS at the 5:46 mark...resulting in a directionless mish-mash than should have been forgotten during the writing stage.     I heard half the album upto this point in one go then took a break to hear some good music, my senses were just crying out for something tasteful. I thought it would be a good idea to inject some positivity to this review too, by reviewing that other music I heard, so here's a quick review of Killers:     KILLERS: You can't criticise this album really! Awesome line-up, with a vocalist who doesn't lose his breath and yet keep singing. A drummer who had groove and ideas that had feel and no repetition. Purgatory, Genghis Khan, Killers, Innocent Exile, Twilight Zone, Prodigal Son, this can't be beat!!!     Now back to Final Frontier. This band really might have a slight chance if they got Blaze back. The singing is a major drag on the band. Actually I think they need to fire Nicko, and Adrian too. Harris should take a back seat and stick to focussing on live performances. Murray might regain his inspiration if he had other good song writers to work with.     Halfway through Starblind I started fast forwarding. This was too predictable, too ughh... the whole B-side... DO YOU HONESTLY NOT SEE HOW OLD THIS IS??     For the poor musically starved people, the bare minimum of variation has become a masterwork. I'm reminded of a certain president promising change and fooling a good many.     Do I have to explain how wrong the fans and reviews have it? According to Rock Sound, the album is \\"an essay on death, war, adventure and the human condition\\" and says that it \\"might sound alien at first.\\" Ofcourse not a single IM album going back to the 80s has not had these major themes, (The previous album and X Factor were almost all about war) but the moe rons will insist that this is all somehow fresh.     MASS GULLIBILITY.     Accept it, Maiden IS OLD.     I though Dance of Death and AMOLAD were horrible but this is going too far. The bad songs are now 7 minutes average, one after the other!     Find yourself something new to listen to and salvage what's left of your taste if you can.     If anyone is planning on telling me that this needs a couple of listens before you can understand its complexity, I will say only this: GROW UP. You're only fooling yourself, telling yourself that this rehashed mess is challenging anyone but yourselves.
B002RWKSII|5.0|Brian Wilson and his band do a good job covering Gershwin song standards. I don't know every Gershwin tune, but I enjoy listening to this music. \\"Rhapsody In Blue\\" is one of Gershwin's most well known song, but Brian devotes just one minute in the beginning and a few seconds at the end.  This track should be much longer.  Still, I think Brian establishes a reverence for the music of the Gershwin's with this track.  I love the ah ah ah's on this first track.  This song makes me forget my troubles for a minute and a half.  My favorite track is actually the new tune on here entitled \\"The Like In I Love You.\\"  This song is very romantic and pretty. It is written by Brian's band mate Scott Bennett. Scott plays piano on many of these tracks too.  Every band member is so talented.  \\"I Got Plenty O' Nothing is another gem here. Paul Mertens plays the harmonica on this track. He gives this song a upbeat quality that I love.  Paul also plays the saxophone on the track \\"I Got Rhythm\\". This song gets my feet moving Brett Simons provides such a smooth relaxing bass sound with his instrument on the tune \\"Aint Necessarily So\\".  \\"They Can't Take That Away For Me\\". is a song that I can picture myself singing with my buddies.  This song makes me feel good.  Brian captures a sentiment of wistful longing with his vocals on the track \\"Someone To Watch Over Me\\". \\"I've Got A Crush On You\\" is a pretty song with a retro Beach Boy feel with Brian's vocals.  Darian Sahanaja lends his talents on the piano on this tune. Probyn Gregory shines playing the acoustic guitar on this song \\"S'Wonderful\\". I am swept away by Probyn's playing.  He compliments  Brian's vocals so well on this song. \\"Love Is Here To Stay\\" is a sweet love song about being in love with someone special\\"  Brian does not have a sensual voice to deliver \\"Summertime\\" like I am accustomed to hearing, but he does possess a soothing voice to put my mind at ease.  I love this new music by Brian Wilson.
B001TKKAJG|2.0|It could be that since I have never owned either the vinyl or standard CD versions of this I have nothing to compare it to.  It is obvious this is an older recording, the sound as one person says is flat and dull.  I had to go and look at the cover again to confirm this was an SACD.  I have older music produced on SACD format that sounds wonderful.  This does not.It sounds like it was recorded on cheap equipment in a basement.  Oh, wait, it was.

0446569895|3.0|I have to start by saying I love Ozzy, I always have. I have seen him countless times live, I own every studio and live album he ever put out with Black Sabbath and solo, you might say I have been a fanatic for years. Which might explain why this book bored me so much. I am familiar with every story in the book and have seen/heard them countless times either in print in magazines or in interviews done by the Ozzman on the radio.<br /><br />There were a few moments where I did find myself laughing out loud which is why I am giving this book 3 stars as opposed to 2.<br />If you are new to the world of Ozzy Osbourne then this book is a great place to learn about the history of Ozzy Osbourne but on the flip side if you are a 35+ years fan like myself of Black Sabbath and Ozzy you've probably already seen or heard all that this book has to say.<br /><br />Plus it's written with an extremely British flair, you might want to get an American English to British dictionary if you are unfamiliar with the Brits slang terms.<br /><br />Love ya Ozzy and I hope you live another 60 years, just stick to music from now on.
B003JTHESA|1.0|How many other words can describe this album, and in fact, every Iron Maiden album since 1995, with the possible exception of Brave New World?  Iron Maiden has now made the same album five times in a row, a dense, plodding 70+ minute record of \\"songs\\" that chug on mindlessly for eight minutes.  There is no cohesion to the songs, no real purpose in mind, other than to fill the album up with noise.  The album almost entirely lacks memorable riffs, solos, and lyrics. This may actually be the first Maiden album to date that lacks even one truly great song; even Virtual XI had The Clansman.  This album has nada, yet will undoubtedly get an average 4 or 5-star rating on here from the undiscriminating, tasteless Iron Maiden sheep, of which there are many.    With the exception of the first two tracks and The Alchemist, which sounds like a remake of Public Enema Number One and one of the band's worst songs in recent memory, nearly every song on The Final Frontier starts off with a one to two-minute soft opening with Bruce mumbling.  It then goes into the chugging verse, a chorus, and a long instrumental section.  It then goes back into a verse and a chorus, and ends with a repeat of the soft intro.  Completely predictable and routine, just like A Matter of Life and Death.  The album's best song is The Talisman, which at least has a good chorus and decent rhthym, even though it's a rehash of Lord of Light.  Most of the other songs aren't worth getting into, although the title track is at least halfway acceptable.    Doesn't Steve Harris realize that if a record isn't properly mixed and mastered that it makes the music tough to listen to and get into?  Thank God he didn't have as much control over the 80s Maiden albums, which were produced by Martin Birch.  Iron Maiden today is in serious need of a producer who will direct them and hone their skills and make albums that are memorable and fun to listen to.  For a band with three guitarists to create an album this bland and uninspired is inexcusable.  When 75% of the album sounds exactly alike you know there's a serious lack of direction in the band.  Iron Maiden needs to do what Judas Priest did in 1990 and make its own Painkiller, an album of fast, catchy, powerful rockers.  Ater fifteen years of the same boring rubbish it's time for a return to what originally worked.
B0000DD7LC|4.0|Alicia Keys created quite a stir the entire summer before her debut album [[ASIN:B00005JXS6 Songs in a Minor]] hit the record racks with one of the most intense promotional campaigns to have come around since Bruce Springsteen in the early 70's. That album,which looked to blend Alicia's mixture of European classical music and American jazz-funk with hip-hop beats wound up being a bit hyped and it's hit \\"Fallin\\" became a bit overplayed and it would've been almost easy for Keys to wind up less hip and more hype,if readers here will forgive that lousy slogan. A couple years later Alicia came back with her second album which would make her or break her as the serious musician/singer/songwriter that she always was. This time the promotion was more genuine  and she wasn't as caught up in the \\"I'm going to save R&B music\\" kind of manifesto that accompanied her first album. She was therefore more free to be herself and the result is an album that in basic terms cut back on some of the heavier hip-hop beats and consentrating on her ability to craft music like a fine knit sweater. The tapestry she comes up with here is built a lot more around her piano based chord progressions and her flexible vocal stylings. Overall it's a very musicianly album that doesn't have the emmediate commercial appeal you might expect but even on one of it's most powerful and popular songs \\"You Don't Know My Name\\",her second big hit actually the music has a finely arranged retro soul flavor with some some beautiful,avante garde jazz styled high piano chordings that give the song it's hook. I liked the fact she reached outside the pop ideom for the hook on this song-it also matches her high pitched,passionate coos on the refrains. The same flavor crosses over into the spirited medley of \\"If I Were Your Woman/Walk On By\\",\\"If I Ain't Got You\\" and the title song. The final song \\"Nobody Not Really\\" has one of the most intricately chorded piano part since Stevie Wonder's \\"I Gotta Have A Song\\" so basically this consists of emaculately produced and arranged,midtempo jazzy soul/funk tunes with some expressive vocal changes and personalized lyrical themes. On the songs that do feature something more of a hip-hop flavor such as \\"Karma\\" you have a great song with a very stiff rhythm and that kind of keeps it from being a complete masterpiece. But overall it's actually one of the closest places Alicia has come to a consistantly fully realized album and expressess her artistry for what it was rather than as something that has too much of a deliberate intention behind it.otta Have A Song\\" so basically this consists of emaculately produced and arranged,midtempo jazzy soul/funk tunes with some expressive vocal changes and personalized lyrical themes.

B003FK8V7G|4.0|The latest from The Gaslight Anthem, \\"American Slang\\" (SideOneDummy Records), is set for release in the U.S. and Canada on June 15th, and around the world that same week. Produced by Ted Hutt (who produced the band's acclaimed second album, \\"The '59 Sound\\", \\"American Slang\\" heralds a dramatic leap forward for The Gaslight Anthem.    The Gaslight Anthem is Brian Fallon (vocals/rhythm guitar), Alex Rosamilia (guitar), Ben Horowitz (drums) and Alex Levine (bass). This band from New Brunswick, New Jersey have built a solid fan base already and are poised to breakout worldwide with \\"American Slang\\".    \\"American Slang\\" wastes no time reaching into your heart and grabbing your attention. The first three tunes, which include the title track, \\"Stay Lucky\\", and \\"Bring It On\\", are modern rock perfection with big chorus hooks, compelling lyrics, and driving instrumentation. Fallon's voice has just enough scratch and howl to be convincing as a rock and roll purist, but not so much that he would scare pop rock fans away - think Bruce Springsteen if he were a punk rocker. The band's punk influence is clearly evident in the punchy guitars, Fallon's occasional snarl, and the band's emo-styled harmonies, but I would not call them a punk band. \\"American Slang\\" is straight-up modern rock for the smart music fan. Additional highlights on the record include the driving anthem \\"Orphans\\", the insightful \\"Old Haunts\\", and \\"The Spirit Of Jazz\\".    Gaslight Anthem has burned the midnight oil on this one - their music is alive and kicking, boisterous yet reflective. The band's contagious energy simply bursts out of their music. The first single off the album, the title track \\"American Slang,\\" is currently streaming on the band's Facebook and MySpace pages.    Best tracks: 1, 2, 3, 6, 8, 9  Bill's Music Forum review
B000093BDX|3.0|This is just a compilation of songs, and as such it doesn't have the feeling of flow that original albums have.
B0039SFKSW|3.0|The reunited supergroup Asia (Geoffrey Downes, Steve Howe, Carl Palmer, and John Wetton) is back with its follow up to the excellent \\"Phoenix\\" (2008). I am a huge fan of their big 80s hits like \\"Heat Of The Moment\\", \\"Only Time Will Tell\\", and \\"Don't Cry\\" and thought that \\"Phoenix\\" was a respectable comeback. In my opinion, Asia works best when they temper their prog rock with catchy hooks and radio-friendly songwriting. Unfortunately, this is not the case on their latest, \\"Omega\\".    This is not to say that \\"Omega\\" is a a total dud, but in general it is pretty dull and unengaging. What saves the record are cuts like the arena ready opener, \\"Finger On The Trigger\\", which has just about everything a casual fan of Asia would desire. \\"I'm Still The Same\\" is another pop rocker that drills into the mind a lot faster than the other songs on \\"Omega\\". There are some additional tracks near the end that (subtly)recall their 80s hey day, with \\"I Believe\\" being one of the best uptempo tunes on the record. The CD closes with a decent ballad called \\"Don't Wanna Lose You Now\\".    As always, the musicianship and production is top notch, and Asia's lyrics remain more cerebral than your average AOR band. Too bad the songs on \\"Omega\\" are not as strong as the players.

B002BSHXJA|5.0|This box set, while it can be pricey, is definitely worth it. I spent days going back and forth between this and the stereo box and really this box completely trumps the other one. Mono was how these albums were intended. (Of course the last three albums, Yellow Submarine, Abbey Road, and Let it Be, are not included because it was originally done in stereo.) Still the way the CDs are packaged is exactly the way they were done in the vinyl LPs (except smaller). Very cute, indeed. It brings you back to the good ol' 60s and 70s. ONE THING TO BE WARY OF: BOOT LEG COPIES. Really a lot of these boxes can be scams. I was lucky. A good safety measure is that if this box is going for anything $100 it's probably a boot leg, especially if it's from a \\"just launched\\" seller. I would look for a good used box (which is what I have) if you really want to save some money. :D Happy shopping!
B00284BMBM|3.0|Chris Daughtry is now feeling the other side of the double-edge sword of having a phenomenally successful debut album. The former American Idol contestant was subject to one of the biggest injustices in the history of the show by being voted off far too early in the competition several years ago. Perhaps a blessing in disguise, he went on to make one of the biggest selling records in recent times, gracing radio with plenty of melodic hard rock goodness. He is his own hard act to follow.    To help with the sophomore effort, Daughtry has enlisted the songwriting talents of Nickelback's Chad Kroeger, Brian Howes, Mitch Allen, and more. The disc begins with the in your face guitars and the soaring, badass vocals we all expect from Daughtry. After this fierce reminder that he is still a force to be reckoned with, he glides right into the more radio-friendly \\"No Surprise\\", following this up with three more pop-based rockers, \\"Everytime You Turn Around\\" (a personal favorite), \\"Life After You\\", and \\"What I Meant To Say\\". After this, the songs are OK, rarely leaving the ballad or mid-tempo pace, and not matching the quality we've heard on the debut. The latter half of the CD is very ballad heavy and grows tiresome, not helped by duds like the country-flavored \\"Tennessee Line\\".    Another complaint is that the record seems to be on a mission to impress with the guitars and bombastic production rather than the voice. Daughtry has an amazing voice, but it is a shame to hear it take so few chances and to persistently get buried in the excessively loud guitars. Lyrically, we're also on ho-hum ground: unimaginative and straight-forward, but at least not silly.    The record is solid, but Daughtry is just running in place. In short, the title of the first single pretty much sums up the record as a whole: no surprise. I hope he comes back with a vengenace on the third release to give us the record we know he has the potential to deliver.    Best tracks: 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 8  Bill's Music Forum review
B003EYVXTG|5.0|I could feel the chill in my theatre seat! Great performances abound in this stark, realistic, and visually captivating tale of rural poverty and addiction. I was moved by the courage of Rhee, and the unspoken codes of family and honor proudly displayed despite a truly devasting environment. I can't wait for the soundtrack!  Great job!  More please!
B0002S947K|5.0|Amazing CD! I bought it to listen to Trouble and fell in love with Jolene and Burn!!! This is a rare CD that I love every single song!
B00005LELD|4.0|After purchasing a Nikon D90, my first lens was the 50mm f/1.8 prime.  I had planned to put a filter on the lens, as protection for the lens.  However, upon viewing the lens, it didn't make sense to put a filter on it, so I purchased this hood instead.    The glass of the 50mm lens is about 1.5\\" in diameter (a bit bigger than a quarter), and is recessed behind the rim of the lens about 1.5\\" or 2\\" (I'm guessing).  So the lens glass is much smaller than the size of the filter (perhaps 25% of the filter size), and recessed, which adds protection.  As such, it didn't make sense to me to go from a 1.5\\" diameter piece of glass to a 3\\" diameter of glass (ie filter) which would also be on the very front of the lens, and not recessed.  I tested my theory outside shooting into the sun, attempting to get the worst lens flare possible.  Even with a high quality B+W multi-coated UV filter (about a $50 filter), I still got a noticeable amount of increased flare, compared to shooting without the filter.  So I decided not to use a filter on this particular lens.    But I still had a weird feeling like I'm not protecting my lens, so I tried this hood.    The hood is a thick, flexible rubber, which collapses and extends manually.  When collapsed, it is about 1/2 inch thick.  When extended, it is about three inches deep.  When extended, the rubber is pretty soft, so with very little pressure, you can fold/bend it.  As such, I'm not sure if it would really protect the lens much.  However, if I were to drop the lens on its face (without the hood), I could imagine the filter ring cracking, but the glass being fine.  With the hood screwed onto the filter ring, perhaps it would soften the blow and protect it.  I guess I was expecting the hood material to be firm or at least, firmer than it is.  Regardless, I plan to leave it on the camera since I went to the trouble of ordering it.  Also, the ring part that screws onto the end of your lens where a filter would go, is metal.  It is the onlypart of the hood that is metal; the rest is the flexible rubber.    I still need to test the hood for what it is really designed to do - block excess light from entering the lens.  I will update my review when I do.    Also, on a silly note, my 50mm prime looks really tiny on my D90 when I have the enormous SB-900 on top of the camera.  This hood will at least make the appearance of the camera more balanced until I get a bigger lens!
B0034G4OU4|5.0|I was hesitant to see the film, knowing how Hollywood can take a good book and ruin it.  I was also dismayed at the choice of Julia Roberts as Liz Gilbert.  Having read the book, I had a hard time imagining Roberts portraying the very intelligent, honest, and sincerely soul-searching Gilbert.  I can think of a number of finer actresses who would have been more convincing and perhaps contributed to a better film.    However, it seems that the fault is not all with Roberts.  I think the director must have played a major role in diminishing the book.  Still, we have to thank him for bringing it to life.  It is, by the way, visually gorgeous.     One of the major faults of the script is the way it didn't adequately show the depths of Gilbert's despair in the beginning.   It  actually portrayed her husband as a pleasant-enough guy which is contrary to the message in the book. The film almost makes it seem that she's leaving him just because he doesn't want to go to Aruba with her.  No wonder so many people who haven't read the book slam this character as empty, spoiled, whiney and selfish.  As another reviewer mentioned, it is her acute despair that propells her to make her amazing journey.    About half way through the film, I overcame my dislike of Roberts.  It was, coincidently, in the India segment, about the time Gilbert began to face her own problems and discovered a new depth in herself.  Roberts rose to the occasion and showed the new maturity beautifully.  The scene where she offers her \\"gift\\" to the newlywed Indian girl is quite moving.    Richard Jenkins is fun as the Texan she meets at the Ashram, although I did find his \\"confession\\" scene a little over-the-top.  James Franco as the actor didn't really impress me either...maybe because he mumbled most of his lines, preferring a lot of loopy facial expressions to portray his ardor.    The actors in Bali were good, especially the fellow who played the wise man.  He is almost worth the price of admission.  I agree with another reviewer that the interaction between Gilbert and Wayan, the medicine woman, was given short shrift.  But the importance of the Bali sequence was that this was where she found \\"love.\\"  Bardem plays the charming Brazlian entrepreneur who overcomes her fear of love beautifully.  He's a little shaggy but that doesn't detract from his immense charm. He's perfect for the part--seems truly to be a man who is worth her attention, as opposed to the two she left behind.    I thought the Amazon review was excellent except for the conclusion that the story was more escape than spiritual.  To me, this came across as a remarkable tale of a genuine spiritual voyage.  The fact that it has a happy ending shows that she did the hard work, faced her own inner demons and came out a better, happier person, more willing to love and to be loved. Doing this intense inner work is not self-indulgent or escapist; it's very hard and I commend Gilbert and anyone who endeavors to undertake it. It is hardly escapist.  I can only guess that people who haven't done this kind of inner jouney have no inkling of what they're missing.  Too bad...I hope this film helps some of them to wake up!    Despite the flaws of the film, I give it five stars for it's theme.
B003YOWU1Q|5.0|Great album! Can't wait to give the whole album, \\"God Willing and the Creek Don't Rise\\", the vast number of plays that all my other  Ray LaMontagne albums have gotten. Ray always grows on you with time-the best test of an amazing artist! Loved the free download \\"Summer.\\" which has already had countless plays.
B003YOWU1Q|5.0|A genuinely haunting and hypnotic journey.  The lyrics tell stories perfectly matched to the unique voice and subtle instruments.  Don't be fooled by the peaceful appearance - these are genuine stories of loss, desire and heartbreak.  The interplay of the steel guitar is the unifying thread throughout.  Maybe not the genius of \\"Nashville Skyline\\", but reminiscent.  A highly recommended interlude.  Don't cheat yourself by trying to pick individual songs - buy the whole disc.
B0013FNC38|5.0|Here are some of my favorites on this album!      I'm yours-an appealing commercial favorite, the lyrics are very sweet and can be sung along to easily.    Lucky-Duet is sung w/ Colbie Caillat, about being in love with your best friend.       Love For a Child-about a child's point of view of their parents divorce. Innocent, touching, could make you cry.    Details In The Fabric-helped me through a tough time. I was on my way to my doctors w/ my son, (who needed an EEG because he had a seizure)when his song came on and the lyrics \\"hold your own, know your name, go your own way..........everything...will be fine\\" played and helped me get through my day. Duet is w/ James Morrison.    If It Kills Me-I first heard this song on \\"So You Think You Can Dance\\" its a wonderful tribute of finding a way of telling your best friend that you're in love with them when they have no idea.    I love that Jason Mraz has a pure voice, his songs always have a good message, and he seems very laid back. :)
0596805888|3.0|I think that 'Cooking for Geeks: Real Science, Great Hacks, and Good Food' is a niche book and the audience is very, very small.  Having said that, I really don't know why the book was made.  The content is neat, it's a cookbook that goes beyond cooking and tells you more about the hows and whys of the foods you are making from the nerds themselves.  The problem is that most of the 'geeks' I have met couldn't care less about all the details and most aren't really interested in cooking in the first place.  Most people would rather have 1 of 2 things: go pick something up that is quick or a recipe that has a few lines of HOW to do things, not discovering the right temperatures to cook chocolate at (as an example).<br /><br />If you love to cook and you are an engineer, then you might like this book.  I myself would rather just have the recipe and save the documentary on food to another medium.<br /><br />***
0307346609|5.0|This book is a must read if you are into Zombies. It lays out a great linear time line for the Zombie situation and how it developed.   If you are into Zombies but don't have this book, then you are missing a great experience.
0545123283|4.0|I loved the first book to this series so much so I couldn't wait for this book to come out. But unfortunately this one lack something that the first book had. It was still a interesting read just not as good as the first.

Well done Max Brooks!!
0307594777|5.0|I got through these three books in about a week, and that was taking it slowly. As I'm sure others have said, when I finally finished the third book, I really felt that this is a series which should just keep going and going - regrettably impossible, of course.    The character of Salander gets the lion's share of attention, and she is a fantastic literary creation, but we shouldn't overlook the other great characters in the books, not least of course \\"Kalle\\" Blomkvist, a freewheeling journalist obsessed with his work, his classy (and married) sex-buddy and fellow journalist Berger, the horrifyingly screwed-up Martin Vanger...even Salander's fellow hackers, who are essentially bit parts, are interesting.    The stories are wonderful and really draw the reader in. There is no inconsistency, everything flows. Not once did I go \\"huh?\\". Of course there is some artistic license going on -  while it is improbable that Salander could get the better of her brother (a 6'6 giant with no pain receptors!), the way she finally does him in is very neat. You could literally say that she nailed him...    Another hugely impressive thing about these books is how they work their political and social messages into the plot yet never once come across as preachy. Thought-provoking for certain, but never didactic. I'm sure that they resonate a little more with Swedish readers, but even if you don't know the second thing about Sweden or its history, these books can be read as mystery-thrillers of the highest possible quality.    Larsson's untimely death robbed the world of a great talent, but at the same time he went out with the mother of all literary bangs, and we are lucky that he gave us this absolutely superb trilogy.
B0026P3G12|5.0|I love every song on this CD! Susan Boyle has an amazing voice. The title song is probably the most recognized since she totally blew away Simon Cowell when she sang the first note of it.  But my favorite is Wild Horses, with its haunting melody and words. Not being a big fan of the Rolling Stones, I was not familiar with this song prior to listening to the CD so I will always associate it with Susan Boyle and I don't think anyone could do it better. I also really like \\"Who I Was Born To Be\\". The collection of songs is quite eclectic, from spiritual to rock and roll, and she handles them all beautifully. It is somewhat difficult to understand some of the words - must be her accent - but the lyrics for each song are included along with some of her thoughts about each one. I'm looking forward to her next CD.
B003JTHESA|5.0|NOTE: This review is of the vinyl, so that's why I mention some of the vinyl stuff.<br /><br />Some of the reviewers on this website sadden me. After 3 spins of the album on vinyl today, I'd really confirmed it to myself that this album is the very reason that Maiden never get old. Then I came on here and looked at the reviews, and was blown away at some of the reviewers. One mentioned that \\"The Alchemist\\" is a remake of \\"Public Enema #1\\", and stuff. Others call the songs too long, or too complex, or that it doesn't sound like Maiden. Or that it's repetitive.<br /><br />To me, that's ridiculous. For starters, all the songs on here are different, they feel like a symphony. An album is a symphony and a single track is a movement. By the time we reach \\"When The Wild Wind Blows\\", I feel like I have reached the top of a huge mountain, it is that beautiful. I'll give people the benefit of the doubt seeing as this album isn't for everyone. But I do beg of you guys, PLEASE GIVE THIS ALBUM SOME TIME!!!! Just listen to it more and more, and the more you listen, more things will pop out at you. I was rather meh about \\"Starblind\\" when I first heard it, now I totally love it and call it one of Maiden's best.<br /><br />Now let's cut that out and get straight to the point: This album is totally amazing. Like I said, it will take some time to grow on you, but when it does, it will be your drug of choice.<br /><br />To start the album off, we have a two part, 8 minute opener. I know, that sounds odd. Two parts??? Eight minutes??? Huh??? Shouldn't we be getting a 4-5 minute opener that will be a concert opener?? OK let me do some convincing: It begins with a totally sci-fi and heavy bass riff that will blow you away. STILL not convinced yet? What about the fact that after that kick-arse bass riff, we get some tribal drums, heavy and punchy guitar riffs, and some surreal vocals??? Yeah I know, it sounds awesome, doesn't it??? Well hear it for yourself. This is THE perfect way to start an album. It is by far the best Maiden opener to date since The Wicker Man. In case I haven't told you, it's the first part and it's callled \\"Satellite 15\\". Then, the second part is a catchy tune in the tradition of old Maiden, \\"The Final Frontier\\". \\"I'm stranded in space, I'm lost without trace, I haven't a chance of getting away!!!\\" sings Bruce with his ever-so-stellar voice. The song has a catchy and singalongable chorus and some awesome guitar work including an especially great solo from Mr. Dave Murray!<br /><br />Most of you have already heard \\"El Dorado\\" about 5000 times now since you downloaded it for free on June 9th, and believe me, even having listened to it with the whole album, I'm STILL not tired of it!!! It has a very cynical and satirical lyric about the recession, and as someone who almost got laid off because of the recession, I found this track to be one of Maiden's best. That said, thankfully this track isn't indicative of the rest of the album because what follows is proof of Maiden's getting better with age. \\"Mother of Mercy\\" is a BNW-meets-The Longest Day kind of track, and is lyrically reminiscent of \\"Afraid to Shoot Strangers\\". The song is absolutely beautiful, the lyrics are just stunningly powerful and devastating, and musically the song is just brilliant. The part on \\"I'm a soldier of waaaarrrr!!!!\\" has some of Maiden's best riffing. Then of course comes \\"Coming Home\\", and we all know the words \\"Iron Maiden\\" and \\"Ballad\\" don't sit well with a lot of people. But thankfully this song doesn't disappoint and is a song that kind of sounds like Solo Bruce in a way. But that's not a bad thing- this song is beautiful and painful, with some great riffs and lyrics about when you come home from far away places, you're sad to leave but at the same time just happy you're home.<br /><br />Fans of old school Maiden will definitely dig the 80s-esque song \\"The Alchemist\\". Don't be fooled, fans of solo Bruce. This song has nothing to do with the Bruce solo track. It's the shortest track on the album at 4:29 long, and contains some punchy riffs and great vocals, where Bruce adheres to his rough style in some parts. After that comes Isle of Avalon, with it's eastern-tinged intro which features some wind blowing, and makes you imagine an Eastern desert with the wind blowing and sand blowing over the dunes. There is tons of suspense in the intro with Bruce's stellar vocals and Nicko's hi-hat beat and pedaling (a la Dream of Mirrors). \\"I can hear you, can't you hear me? I can feel you, can't you feel me?\\" sings Bruce as the song kicks into some full-tilt heavy metal. \\"Starblind\\" comes next, a hypnotic and beautiful, proggy track. With a great chorus (\\"Starblind, with sun! The stars are one!\\"), beautiful vocals from Bruce, and some great solos, the song really has a hypnotic, otherworldly feel.<br /><br />Best of all is \\"The Talisman\\", a song that starts off chilled out and acoustic but has a somewhat disturbing suspenseful buildup, as Bruce's brooding low singing and lyrics manage to create the image of leaving on a ship. Then the metal kicks in, and is catchy as ever!!! The lyrics are about a ship in the middle of a storm, and are just fantastic. Nicko also graces us with some of his trademark pedal galloping, and the \\"Westward the tide...\\" part just makes me wanna sing along every time I hear it. I kid you not this song is on the level of Hallowed, and I hate making such bold statements like that, because Hallowed, for me, is unbeatable! \\"The Man Who Would be King\\" is just beautiful. After a soft intro, Maiden give us a great track full of surprises and a great chorus (\\"Destiny, no good hide away, Penance now, will be his only way...\\"). The best part is the Dream Theateresque turn it takes in the middle, and Dave's solo is just  plain pleasure for the ear. Last but not least is a song that brings out some tears every time I hear it, \\"When the Wild Wind Blows\\". It's 11 minutes long but it goes by so quickly, it feels like only 6. Based on the film of the same name about a Nuclear fallout and very adventurous, this song manages to paint a picture of an old couple trying to survive this dreadful event. The solos are great, and as the song ends, a final gust of wind is heard, bringing a devastating and powerful end to a great album.<br /><br />OK, so the review's not over yet. I'm sorry if I'm going on for way too long, but the album is so great that a short review doesn't do it justice. This album is just beautiful in every sense of the word, and definitely is an acquired taste. Like I said, this album is like a fine wine, it gets better with age. I had the pleasure of seeing Maiden for the second time this year, and with a setlist focusing mainly on new material, it was brilliant. They played El Dorado live and it especially sounds great live. Bruce also mentioned that the album must get to #1 on the US charts, so let's try to make that happen, people, as I am absolutely certain it will, seeing as at HMV today, the album was flying off the shelves!<br /><br />About the vinyl. I got it today with the Mission Editionj (I'll admit I got that for the bonus stuff). The vinyl is on picture (DUN! DUN! DUUUUUUUNNNN!!!!!!), and thankfully sounds great! I was skeptical about it being PD since PDs are crap (We all know how bad AMOLAD sounded on PD), but thankfully it sounds fantastic. There's some gorgeous pictures including a super cool photo of the band illuminated by blue light from behind, and the sleeves have great space artwork along with a photo of the crosskeys, and the Eddie on the FF tour poster. Overall worth the $40 I spent!<br /><br />So to close this LOOONG review, if you can appreciate the fact that Maiden aren't crowd pleasers any more, that they've changed in the period of time they've been around and that they won't make Powerslave or Brave New World anymore, you will enjoy this album just as much as I did. It's a fantastic album, and thankfully it isn't really the \\"FINAL\\"frontier as the title may suggest. I'll close this review with three more words:<br /><br />UP THE IRONS!Nuclear fallout and very adventurous, this song manages to paint a picture of an old couple trying to survive this dreadful event. The solos are great, and as the song ends, a final gust of wind is heard, bringing a devastating and powerful end to a great album.    OK, so the review's not over yet. I'm sorry if I'm going on for way too long, but the album is so great that a short review doesn't do it justice. This album is just beautiful in every sense of the word, and definitely is an acquired taste. Like I said, this album is like a fine wine, it gets better with age. I had the pleasure of seeing Maiden for the second time this year, and with a setlist focusing mainly on new material, it was brilliant. They played El Dorado live and it especially sounds great live. Bruce also mentioned that the album must get to #1 on the US charts, so let's try to make that happen, people, as I am absolutely certain it will, seeing as at HMV today, the album was flying off the shelves!      About the vinyl. I got it today with the Mission Editionj (I'll admit I got that for the bonus stuff). The vinyl is on picture (DUN! DUN! DUUUUUUUNNNN!!!!!!), and thankfully sounds great! I was skeptical about it being PD since PDs are crap (We all know how bad AMOLAD sounded on PD), but thankfully it sounds fantastic. There's some gorgeous pictures including a super cool photo of the band illuminated by blue light from behind, and the sleeves have great space artwork along with a photo of the crosskeys, and the Eddie on the FF tour poster. Overall worth the $40 I spent!    So to close this LOOONG review, if you can appreciate the fact that Maiden aren't crowd pleasers any more, that they've changed in the period of time they've been around and that they won't make Powerslave or Brave New World anymore, you will enjoy this album just as much as I did. It's a fantastic album, and thankfully it isn't really the \\"FINAL\\" frontier as the title may suggest. I'll close this review with three more words:    UP THE IRONS!
B002BWP4A6|5.0|Stunningly beautiful, shot in the exquisite black and white, with the faces of the characters looking like the old pictures from the beginning of the 20th century, The White Ribbon has the longer title in German, Das wei&szlig;e Band, Eine deutsche Kindergeschichte -The White Ribbon - A German Children's Tale. The longer title gives quite a good idea behind the mystery of the troubling, disturbing, and shocking events in the film that did not have an explanation by the end of the film and left some viewers confused and unsatisfied. I think that the film is very clear and if approached with the open mind and readiness to accept the subtle details in the storytelling and implication, the open end will not disappoint. Anybody who is familiar with the work of Michael Haneke knows very well that he does not make pure mystery/thrillers even though his movies have a lot of mysteries and often very dark secrets By his own admissions, he uses the mystery in the White Ribbon to show the origins of the extremism of all epochs, and what could have been the beginning of the darkest times in the history of the country. Looking at the life of one small picturesque village in the northern Germany just on the brink of the World War 1, Haneke explores the malice, envy, apathy, hatred, and brutality that envelop the village like a web, and lead to the outbursts of evil that goes unpunished and will bring the larger evil in the future. While watching the film, I kept thinking how much it brings to mind the films of another master of grim and sad yet compelling and thought provoking pictures, Ingmar Bergman. Two of his films remind The White Ribbon especially. One, The Winter Light, a tragic and thought-provoking film about a village priest (Gunnar Bjornstrand) who can't give much comfort and hope to those who need them as he feels none for himself. Another - Fanny and Alexander, the story told from the point of view of two children, a brother and a sister whose lives changed tragically after their widowed mother married a local bishop, seemingly a charming and caring man. What would have happened to Fanny and Alexander, what kind of persons would they have become or would they have survived had they not had a big dysfunctional but loving family who saved them from the abusive, cruel hypocritical stepfather, Bishop Edvard Vergerus?<br /><br />Like Bergman, Michael Haneke does not make the horror films but the computer generated monsters are simply a joke comparing to the real monsters of hatred and evil that found a place to hide and grow in the souls and minds of the characters in his latest film. It is a serious, disturbing, and thought-provoking film. With all its darkness and pessimism, the film has sweet, touching and even humorous moments. They have to do with the only love story in the film and come to think of it, the only love story in all Haneke's films I've seen, between the film's narrator, the local school teacher and the 17 years old Eva, the nanny for the children of the baron, the most powerful man in village.<br /><br />One of the critics said that The White Ribbon is the film that will haunt the viewers for days and will be seen, discussed and thought of for the decades to come. I completely agree with that, and I feel I can watch it again and again. Yes, it is that good.r their widowed mother married a local bishop, seemingly a charming and caring man.

B003JTHETY|5.0|Some of the reviewers on this website sadden me. After 3 spins of the album on vinyl today, I'd really confirmed it to myself that this album is the very reason that Maiden never get old. Then I came on here and looked at the reviews, and was blown away at some of the reviewers. One mentioned that \\"The Alchemist\\" is a remake of \\"Public Enema #1\\", and stuff. Others call the songs too long, or too complex, or that it doesn't sound like Maiden. Or that it's repetitive.<br /><br />To me, that's ridiculous. For starters, all the songs on here are different, they feel like a symphony. An album is a symphony and a single track is a movement. By the time we reach \\"When The Wild Wind Blows\\", I feel like I have reached the top of a huge mountain, it is that beautiful. I'll give people the benefit of the doubt seeing as this album isn't for everyone. But I do beg of you guys, PLEASE GIVE THIS ALBUM SOME TIME!!!! Just listen to it more and more, and the more you listen, more things will pop out at you. I was rather meh about \\"Starblind\\" when I first heard it, now I totally love it and call it one of Maiden's best.<br /><br />Now let's cut that out and get straight to the point: This album is totally amazing. Like I said, it will take some time to grow on you, but when it does, it will be your drug of choice.<br /><br />To start the album off, we have a two part, 8 minute opener. I know, that sounds odd. Two parts??? Eight minutes??? Huh??? Shouldn't we be getting a 4-5 minute opener that will be a concert opener?? OK let me do some convincing: It begins with a totally sci-fi and heavy bass riff that will blow you away. STILL not convinced yet? What about the fact that after that kick-arse bass riff, we get some tribal drums, heavy and punchy guitar riffs, and some surreal vocals??? Yeah I know, it sounds awesome, doesn't it??? Well hear it for yourself. This is THE perfect way to start an album. It is by far the best Maiden opener to date since The Wicker Man. In case I haven't told you, it's the first part and it's callled \\"Satellite 15\\". Then, the second part is a catchy tune in the tradition of old Maiden, \\"The Final Frontier\\". \\"I'm stranded in space, I'm lost without trace, I haven't a chance of getting away!!!\\" sings Bruce with his ever-so-stellar voice. The song has a catchy and singalongable chorus and some awesome guitar work including an especially great solo from Mr. Dave Murray!<br /><br />Most of you have already heard \\"El Dorado\\" about 5000 times now since you downloaded it for free on June 9th, and believe me, even having listened to it with the whole album, I'm STILL not tired of it!!! It has a very cynical and satirical lyric about the recession, and as someone who almost got laid off because of the recession, I found this track to be one of Maiden's best. That said, thankfully this track isn't indicative of the rest of the album because what follows is proof of Maiden's getting better with age. \\"Mother of Mercy\\" is a BNW-meets-The Longest Day kind of track, and is lyrically reminiscent of \\"Afraid to Shoot Strangers\\". The song is absolutely beautiful, the lyrics are just stunningly powerful and devastating, and musically the song is just brilliant. The part on \\"I'm a soldier of waaaarrrr!!!!\\" has some of Maiden's best riffing. Then of course comes \\"Coming Home\\", and we all know the words \\"Iron Maiden\\" and \\"Ballad\\" don't sit well with a lot of people. But thankfully this song doesn't disappoint and is a song that kind of sounds like Solo Bruce in a way. But that's not a bad thing- this song is beautiful and painful, with some great riffs and lyrics about when you come home from far away places, you're sad to leave but at the same time just happy you're home.<br /><br />Fans of old school Maiden will definitely dig the 80s-esque song \\"The Alchemist\\". Don't be fooled, fans of solo Bruce. This song has nothing to do with the Bruce solo track. It's the shortest track on the album at 4:29 long, and contains some punchy riffs andgreat vocals, where Bruce adheres to his rough style in some parts. After that comes Isle of Avalon, with it's eastern-tinged intro which features some wind blowing, and makes you imagine an Eastern desert with the wind blowing and sand blowing over the dunes. There is tons of suspense in the intro with Bruce's stellar vocals and Nicko's hi-hat beat and pedaling (a la Dream of Mirrors). \\"I can hear you, can't you hear me? I can feel you, can't you feel me?\\" sings Bruce as the song kicks into some full-tilt heavy metal. \\"Starblind\\" comes next, a hypnotic and beautiful, proggy track. With a great chorus (\\"Starblind, with sun! The stars are one!\\"), beautiful vocals from Bruce, and some great solos, the song really has a hypnotic, otherworldly feel.<br /><br />Best of all is \\"The Talisman\\", a song that starts off chilled out and acoustic but has a somewhat disturbing suspenseful buildup, as Bruce's brooding low singing and lyrics manage to create the image of leaving on a ship. Then the metal kicks in, and is catchy as ever!!! The lyrics are about a ship in the middle of a storm, and are just fantastic. Nicko also graces us with some of his trademark pedal galloping, and the \\"Westward the tide...\\" part just makes me wanna sing along every time I hear it. I kid you not this song is on the level of Hallowed, and I hate making such bold statements like that, because Hallowed, for me, is unbeatable! \\"The Man Who Would be King\\" is just beautiful. After a soft intro, Maiden give us a great track full of surprises and a great chorus (\\"Destiny, no good hide away, Penance now, will be his only way...\\"). The best part is the Dream Theateresque turn it takes in the middle, and Dave's solo is just  plain pleasure for the ear. Last but not least is a song that brings out some tears every time I hear it, \\"When the Wild Wind Blows\\". It's 11 minutes long but it goes by so quickly, it feels like only 6. Based on the film of the same name about a Nuclear fallout and very adventurous, this song manages to paint a picture of an old couple trying to survive this dreadful event. The solos are great, and as the song ends, a final gust of wind is heard, bringing a devastating and powerful end to a great album.<br /><br />OK, so the review's not over yet. I'm sorry if I'm going on for way too long, but the album is so great that a short review doesn't do it justice. This album is just beautiful in every sense of the word, and definitely is an acquired taste. Like I said, this album is like a fine wine, it gets better with age. I had the pleasure of seeing Maiden for the second time this year, and with a setlist focusing mainly on new material, it was brilliant. They played El Dorado live and it especially sounds great live. Bruce also mentioned that the album must get to #1 on the US charts, so let's try to make that happen, people, as I am absolutely certain it will, seeing as at HMV today, the album was flying off the shelves!<br /><br />I'm really disappointed with this so-called \\"Mission edition\\" though. I accessed the bonus content that can be found online (just put your CD in and go \\"[...]\\") and TBH there isn't much. The interviews, while intriguing, are very short and shallow. I was really expecting a lot more, as well as the game is just lame. I spent an hour on one level, it really is that lame.<br /><br />So to close this LOOONG review, if you can appreciate the fact that Maiden aren't crowd pleasers any more, that they've changed in the period of time they've been around and that they won't make Powerslave or Brave New World anymore, you will enjoy this album just as much as I did.

B003G88WTO|5.0|This may not be the most accessible album of the year, but it is one of the best. It's a complex dance album that isn't really for casual listening. Seeing this band makes it even better since there are sounds that are easier to appreciate in sight than in sound. Don't steal that.
B003A4IFGY|3.0|All Tom Petty's work is, of course, good but the hype over this newly released MOJO was not deserved.  Good but not great--
0684853523|5.0|Stephen King reveals the soul behind the man in this clearly written, pithy autobiographical effort to give the reader valuable tips on writing.  There is no pretense, just solid morsels of the author's own way of thinking about writing.  Many of them are treasures that deserve to be mentally stowed away and put into practice when aspiring (or long-time)writers take up the pen.
B0036EH3X4|1.0|The show was great as I was hooked onto it for six years.  The reason movies like Sixth Sense or others were watched over and over was they made you wondered how did you miss the clues the first time you watched the movie.      Lost was an insult on the face of all the audience and we all know no answers were given and the show ended abruptly.  So, I would not buy Lost final season Iam happy with 1 to 5 seassons
055357342X|4.0|I love the A Song of Ice and Fire series...each book keeps you hanging and it has rather good and fast plot.  I was never much into fantasy but this series has undoubtedly grasped my attention...pure entertainment
B0036EH3WK|3.0|This is not a review this is a question. I would like to know one thing. I don't want to know about the characters or the island or if the 6th season was the worst of all the seasons. I just want to know if it was a good show. I haven't seen the show before and i was thinking of buying this boxset so if someone could answer me if it was a good show thats it nothing else. Thank You- 3 Stars because I don't know if I hate it or if I love it.
B001MEJY8W|5.0|(Basic) story: a young girl is imprisoned and tortured somewhere underground. She unexpectedly escapes. Placed in a specialized institution later on, she grows up troubled but relates to another girl, the two of them forming a solid, mutually supportive tandem which quickly focuses on retrieving the family of kidnappers and taking matters in their own hands. What none of them could imagine, though, is that by getting too close to fire, they could get burnt...<br /><br />In Martyrs, horror and shock don't come primarily from blood, although there is some, or first-degree violence but from the fact that, like Inside, the movie dares attacking what's normally off limits, in this case innocence, the thirst for revenge, love, womanhood, religion and more.<br /><br />Also, the theme's simplicity enables the film-makers to focus and avoid the dispersion of the narrative: it's about torture as a way to reach a \\"higher plane\\" of human consciousness, the rationalizing of torture (by some) as a justifiable means to a (superior, mystic) end with complete disregard for human free will.<br /><br />On top of it, the theme benefits from a flabbergasting final twist. For most of its duration, the movie looks very much like a colder, less gory, more intimate version of Hostel... until something turns it upside down, revealing the disturbing aim of the whole horror and giving it a totally unexpected, mad-like-hell, that-can't-be-true, \\"higher plane\\" conclusion.<br /><br />Finally, the theme is supported by impeccable acting and filming that together shade a powerful and clinical light onto the movie, conveying a desperate sense of isolation: cold colours, cold characters dressed in dark clothes, cold materials such as shiny (marble?) floors, concrete walls, steel, glass... there's no warmth and no hope here except when the camera occasionally depicts naked human bodies.<br /><br />In short, a very powerful, jaw-dropping, eye-opening horror movie and another top-notch proof that good ideas, creativity and risk-taking, which are -and have ALWAYS been- at the core of all forms of arts will always get the upper hand on big bucks, brainless, risk-adverse creation.are -and have ALWAYS been- at the core of all forms of arts will always get the upper hand on big bucks, brainless, risk-adverse creation.
B000PDYVVG|2.0|In spite of its popularity--which can be attributed to it's brilliant cover--this book fails to deliver. And it's unfortunate that it manages to reinforce many negative stereotypes about women and the superficial \\"chick lit\\" they are expected to like. Gilbert explains such criticism as sexist--people don't like her book because it's about a woman. I doubt it would be the object of such criticism if it were a substantial book about a woman's journey. At times this book does show real potential for depth; in the end, however, it is more of a fun beach read than a serious book about spiritual transformation. And this is the disappointment--Rather than applying what she learns on her journey to any larger scope of meaning, Gilbert's focus remains always and only on herself. Also, the stark contrast between her own class privilege and many of the people she meets in India and Indonesia is disturbing, and her failure to acknowledge, never mind provide the slightest bit of critical commentary about, such glaring inequalities is inexcusable. As one reader has written elsewhere, the book in itself is not so awful; what's problematic is the incredible popularity it's received and what this says about the depth, or rather shallowness, of our culture.

B00008RH3L|3.0|I could not understand about half the wordy script here, though the outline of the plot becomes more or less clear after awhile. This is probably one of those films that benefits from multiple viewings, but who has time for that? I still have no idea exactly what the role of John Turturro was supposed to be. In one of the extras, someone says they thought this was a comedy when they first read it, and I can see why. Both the rival crime bosses are almost cartoonish in their anger. The look of certain scenes veers towards the exaggerated look of a cartoon at times, too. In fairness, I did get through this in one sitting, which is rare. I wouldn't call it the best gangster flick ever made, as some say. It is far from that. It is very hard to understand. Still, you will want to see if you agree or if you join the majority who think this was some kind of brilliant inspiration. Not me.
B002MXA7TC|5.0|This CD is truly great, hauntingly beautiful lyrics and music, and the title, Conditions conveys all the emotions of the heart, soul, and the \\"moments of love.\\" The lead singer, Dougie Mandagi has the voice of an angel, the intensity of a tiger and he  also writes, plays the guitar and drums, and all the members of The Temper Trap are extremely talented, like U2 The Temper Trap really enjoy touring and creating together. Anyone that truly loves music written and performed by the actual band and not overly done in the studio will love this CD and will want to see this Austrialian Band perform live. After getting this CD, if they are not performing live near you check them out on youtube.

B003JTHETY|5.0|Although there are a few curveballs thrown our way by Iron Maiden on \\"The Final Frontier,\\" it would be extremely inaccurate to call this newest masterpiece a shocking departure.  Perhaps if you tuned out after \\"Powerslave\\" you might be slightly taken aback by this album, but if you've been plugged into what Maiden has been doing, particulary since the band became a six-piece, you won't be alarmed by any of the progressive turns the band takes here.    Opener \\"Satellite 15...The Final Frontier\\" is a good indicator of what's to come, sounding like a heavier version of something from Pink Floyd's \\"The Wall\\" before settling into that good old thumping groove that we've come to expect from the new millenium Maiden openers.  \\"El Dorado\\" is likewise a mid-paced anthem made for the arena show, and \\"The Alchemist\\" is razor-sharp and heavy.  Songs like \\"Isle of Avalon\\" and \\"The Man Who Would Be King\\" take the album in more progressive turns, complete with right-turn time signature switches and densely layered guitar breaks.  \\"When the Wild Wind Blows\\" and \\"The Talisman\\" are epic narratives that are full of catchy melodies and dynamic shifts that keep them from ever falling into predictability.      Honestly, there isn't one bad track here, but there are also few moments of the kind of immediate, in-your-face metal romps that litter the older Maiden albums.  But you know what?  Maybe that's not such a bad thing.  Iron Maiden has been there, done that, bought the t-shirt.  They completely mastered that style on albums like \\"Piece of Mind\\" and \\"Powerslave.\\"  To continue in that vein would only highlight how thoroughly they'd already explored that style, and inevitably it would invite unkind comparisons.  This direction, this progressive exploration of what's possible in the milieu that Maiden is largely responsible for creating in the first place, is exciting for fans like me.  That said, I can understand why some fans may feel like jumping ship.  If there was ever a clear signthat Maiden was done writing punchy, direct fist-pumpers like \\"The Trooper\\" and \\"Can I Play With Madness,\\" this new album is it (although, really, the preceding three were as well). Yes, these songs are long, with big intros.  If you have such a short attention span that you can't stand a ten minute song, I can recommend some excellent albums by Motorhead, the Ramones, or Torche.  But this is Maiden, it's always been overblown and dramatic to some extent.  And \\"The Final Frontier\\" is a big, overwrought, sweeping, panoramic blockbuster of a metal album.  This is Iron Maiden in the 21st century, all glorious, excessive thunder, operatic light and shade. One can only wonder how the next one will sound (and despite the title, 'Arry assures us this is not the end).    Again, Kevin Shirley's production is uncluttered and warm, although not as much as those classic Martin Birch jobs (and yeah, I do wonder how Birch would record the three guitar line-up). Threre are a few keyboards this time, and Shirley's mix keeps them firmly in their roles as embellishments rather than main attractions. Melvyn Grant's comic book style art is fantastic.  In the end, it's a new Iron Maiden album, and if you call yourself a true metalhead, you should at least take it for a spin.

B002ZG999U|1.0|All these \\"positive\\" reviews are pure hype, and the movie is tripe.     The RAMBO remake was phenomenal; but Excrementals is simply boring. It's all stuff you've seen a million times before, and not cleverly done. Some rich bankers must have funded this, Cousin Hymie gets a script credit; the other Hollywood elites stuff their pockets with millions of $$$ while they laugh in our faces.    Yet another McMovie - loud, obnoxious, overloaded with constant smash-bang-flash that's become the new normal - high priced numbing distraction. Do these elites have any clue how dull this gets? You don't need constant thundering music for EVERY scene - but that's a typical Hwood way of covering ineptitude. Smother everything in noise.    Caveat: I had to endure nearly a half hour of previews (including the impendingly inept GREEN HORNET that screams disaster) - ALL the music is the same. ALL the editing, the flash-crash is the same; just a wall of noise.    Don't waste your $ on these elite bozos.

B003LXM1RS|5.0|I don't remember the last time I listen to a more sexually charged album!  I think it was in 1992 with Madonna's Erotica.  This LP is not for the average-middle class-hetero-Joe.  It's driven, dirty, sexy and more.  I don't understand why they released \\"Fire with Fire\\" first.  It's not the stronger single of the album.    It is produced by Stuart Price, the one who gave us \\"Confessions on a dancefloor\\" few years ago.  It goes electronica-pop-kitsh-80's but there is substance.  It did remind me a lot of the 80's groove.  They have this Bee Gees feeling, ELO sometimes, even Franky goes to Hollywood!    The album opens with \\"Night Work\\", an upbeat song.  \\"Whole new way\\" sounds like \\"I want your sex\\" from Georges Michael.  I'm sure the songs would mix together.  Stand out song : \\"Any which way\\"... wow, it's groove sooooo much! We feel the urge of having sex on a dancefloor.  One of my favorite and the videoclip is awesome.  Remember : \\"Coco butter cash\\"!!!  \\"Harder they get\\" is a mix between Donna Summer and Queen in the 80's.  Love that song!    \\"Running out\\" is really good too with the 80's guitar.  It has a feel of \\"The cars\\".  \\"Something like this\\" is also 80's but more electro. It reminds me of Depeche Mode and Human League.  \\"Skin this cat\\" is the slowest song of the album and it is sing by the gorgeous Ana Matronic.    From \\"Skin thight\\", the rest of the album is like a ready to dance sound track like Madonna's \\"Confessions\\".  \\"Sex and violence\\" seems to be stolen from Bronsky Beat discotheque but it's good! \\"Night life\\" is also a fun song with the base of Pat Benatar.  And the last song, one of my favorite is \\"Invisible light\\" a clear hommage to \\"Franky goes to Hollywood\\"  Relax.    It's one of the fresh album of 2010 and I can't wait to see them live in Montreal (August 29).    If you want to groove in a sexy and sexual way, this album is for you.  And it's cleary for me ;-)    Love the Scissor Sisters and JAKE is the sexiest singer of them all!
B000OXHRRC|1.0|We watched this because the summary sounded interesting and we generally like Russell Crowe, but we only continued watching it because we paid for it.  I figured a movie set in Provence would be interesting at least for the scenery.  There weren't even very many shots of that.  The premise for a good movie was there, and the actors were accomplished, but whoever wrote their lines did a lousy job, it was just boring, and never really went anywhere.  And I found the crudeness to be very unnecessary.  Would never recommend it for any reason.
B0006B29Z2|5.0|To me the best Iron Maiden era is the 1980's in general, I'm a huge fan of the band just as you should be (since you're looking at this product) and I always loved the rawer sound of the early years. Another thing worth mentioning is that I really enjoyed the Paul Di'Anno era of the band and the two albums Paul put out with Maiden back in the early 80's. Don't get me wrong I love just about anything Iron Maiden but I feel those earlier years capture the band at its best, there's something really special about that era for me. Having an entire two discs DVD focusing on those early years is a treat to me, there are some excellent live concerts with both Bruce Dickinson and Paul Di'Anno, a documentary on the early years, a TV documentary on the band, 5 of the band's videos and photo galleries that include tour guides, t-shirts, posters and more from the era. Oh and the years covered in \\"The History of Iron Maiden Part 1: The Early Days\\" are 1980-1983 but in the centerpiece documentary they go way back in the mid 1970's when Steve Harris was just a young man full of ambition ready to bring his band's brand of rock' n 'roll to the world. Plus it has a fairly even representation of both the Di'Anno and Dickinson eras (Dickinson's gets a little more).<br /><br />Here's exactly what you get:<br /><br />Disc One<br /><br />-Live At The Rainbow 1981, 30 minutes, the band's first concert video (and one of the first concert videos, the sound is incredible for the time it was recorded)<br /><br />-Beast Over Hammersmith 1982, 45 minutes, reconstructed footage and never before seen footage<br /><br />-Live In Dortmund 1983, 45 minutes, rare, (the sound of this show is somehow not that great)<br /><br />Disc Two<br /><br />-The Early Days documentary, 90 minutes. The centerpiece of this DVD, goes into details and interviews just about everyone who ever had something to do with Maiden, if you're a hardcore fan this is fascinating.<br /><br />-20th Century Box 1981, 20 minutes, rare television documentary of the band. This one has an interesting take on rock/metal music in general at the time and the various names ex: heavy metal. This documentary is really interesting and it's great to see the band at this time doing what they were doing and all the buzz and energy that was surrounding it.<br /><br />-Live At The Ruskin, rare home movie footage directly from the band's archives.<br /><br />-5 videos : Women In Uniform, Run To The Hills, The Number of The Beast, The Trooper and Flight of Icarus.<br /><br />-Photo Galleries of tour programs, listings and other extras.<br /><br />The Early Days Part 1 is a great look at the band's early years, the concerts and documentaries are really something to watch and own if you're a hardcore fan of the band or if you know someone who is. As the title suggests there is a part 2 to The Early Days and it can be found in the Live After Death DVD, it continues exactly where this one left off in 1983 and although I don't find it as good and less comprehensive than the first one it has some great concert footage and some cool interviews to watch. The History of Iron Maiden Part 1: The Early Days is worth every penny and has a lot to offer. 5 stars.take on rock/metal music in general at the time and the various names ex: heavy metal.

0765350386|2.0|If you started a drinking game while reading the Mistborn Trilogy and had to take a shot every time a character awkwardly started a sentence with the two words \\"But..well...\\" or every time a character began their train of thought with the word \\"Interesting...\\" you'd die of alcohol poisoning before you'd read five chapters.<br /><br />Other than that, these books are totally readable, were written by someone with a terrific imagination who does battle scenes almost as well as anyone in the business. If you don't mind that he also incorporates a fairly heavy dose of Mormon inspired religious overtones, especially towards the end of the series (something I didn't realize until the last book) then I'd recommend reading them.
B003JTHESA|4.0|There it is the new Iron Maiden album, \\"The Final Frontier\\"! As huge of an Iron Maiden fan that I am I will not be too quick to say that it's an instant classic or the best Iron Maiden album ever, that's just not me and let's try to stay objective here for a second. If you know Maiden you should already have a good idea of what to expect, especially if you've heard their last three albums Brave New World (2000), Dance of Death (2003) and A Matter of Life and Death (2006). It doesn't sound all that different from the sound of the albums Iron Maiden put out in the 00's decade and you know what? It's not necessarily a bad thing because the music is still good, creative and the music itself is different and it seems most fans are still enjoying the band today. At this point I'm just thrilled that one of my favorite bands continues to release music of this quality today. It seems as if Maiden's music seems to get more complex (and it was always that way) as they go by, I think this one is an example of that. They keep doing what they do and want because they want to and they don't care for radio airplay, they have some of the most dedicated fans in the world (see Flight 666 DVD).<br /><br />Of course the songs on TFF are long ones (the shortest one being 4:29), however for the casual listener a long song by the band may seem too long, after all not everyone likes 10+ minutes songs you know? Some people think those type of long songs are boring and perhaps pretentious, I think it shows incredible musical ability and willingness to bring the fans creative music but everyone has a different take on this.<br /><br />I will comment on a few songs on The Final Frontier and leave the extended song-by-song analysis to other reviewers. The album opens with Satellite 15...The Final Frontier and it's a great song to open the album, it does a good job in setting the tone of the album! El Dorado was the first song released from the album and it's an excellent song, definitely not the best on TFF but a very good one, some fans have said it sounds a little like Barracuda and I can hear it too. Catchy chorus. Mother of Mercy is a great rocker, one of the shorter songs of the album. Coming Home sounds like anything from the past three albums to me as vague as it sounds, slower and more melodic Maiden. I really like The Alchemist, it's the shortest song here but sometimes the best of things come in small packages, it sounds like it could be on one of Bruce's solo albums. I love the slow and melodic intro to The Man Who Would Be King, great song, I don't know what else to say.The closing song When The Wind Blows is an amazing 11 minutes masterpiece, perhaps the best song of the album, terrific track. Those 10 songs prove that Maiden can still make wonderful music and with each listen I get more and more into the album.<br /><br />I've seen the band in Toronto on their last tour and they were excellent as always. The band put more focus on the reunion albums from the 00's, I was impressed that they did that and I was a little worried at first seeing how everyone loves the classic. However I heard no one complain, in fact most fans knew every word to every song and no one seemed disappointed that they played more of the new material. Iron Maiden is doing what they want and is an example for aspiring musicians out there.<br /><br />Steve Harris has already confirmed that The Final Frontier will NOT be the band's last album; I know some fans were wondering because the title of the album has the word final in it. The Final Frontier should be taken for what it is, a truly very, very good album, I'm really satisfied and Maiden has not let me down! I have to give the album 4 stars, close to a 5, very good album solid all the way through. I know that if you're a fan of the band and their reunion recordings you will enjoy TFF, at least I hope! Iron Maiden don't have to record new music, they could just tour and play the classics over and over but they choose not to do that and give their fans new music, it's pretty amazing especially when you consider that some bands play the classic over and over. The band sounds solid and I think that Bruce Dickinson still has it; the man is in his fifties now give him a break! What's left to say? Enjoy the album and up the irons!<br /><br />P.S.- I can't hide it, I was a little disappointed with the \\"Mission Edition\\" of The Final Frontier, that's the version I wanted to buy but after seeing what it offered more than the standard edition I decided it wasn't enough, plus I just wasn't a fan of the tin foil type of case. The Mission Edition doesn't have any bonus tracks or a DVD, what it does have however is web contents. It's not all that important but I just think you should know what you're buying, I'm not arguing which version you should buy I'm just a fan (probably like you) who decided to stick the regular CD release.<br /><br />P.P.S- Am I the only one who isn't a big fan of the album cover? I like it now but it doesn't look much like Eddie now does it? I only wish they brought Derek Riggs back to paint Eddie.ns new music, it's pretty amazing especially when you consider that some bands play the classic over and over.

B0036T31YY|5.0|This movie forced me to stretch my mind; I've been thinking about it for days. The movie opened up a world of possibilities in my imagination.
B00275EGWY|1.0|The movie was great if you're looking for an action flick.  Kathryn Bigelow did a great job with her budget and the location was pretty spot on as to the look and feel of really being overseas in Iraq.    However my biggest problem was it being lauded as true experience of Iraq.  I feel like the Academy members were nearly strong armed to vote for this film as in \\"If we don't vote for this, it'll look like we don't support the troops.\\"  This film is a far, far cry from a true experience in Iraq.  15 minutes into the first scene, I was ready to turn the film off because it simply wouldn't have happened.  The insurgent with the cell phone detonator would have never had a chance to set off the bomb.  Throughout the film, what really would have happened overseas is eschewed in favor of hollywodizing the experience.  Again, this wouldn't have been a bad thing at all as many military focused films will do this.  However this is touted as a very accurate depiction of troops overseas and it falls very, very short.  Ultimately, it is just another action film dressed up in military fatigues so it would win awards
0891419063|4.0|I enjoyed this book, as it is informative and graphic. Covers a lot of ground. The author's affinity for hyperbole is irritating, leading me to think he wrote with a thesaurus in one hand and a dictionary of obscure references in the other. There are words in this tome that I have never seen or heard.

B001SS3JS8|5.0|This is the story of two families, the Hartes and the Golds, whose lives were intertwined by the close proximity of their homes. James and Gus(Augusta) Harte were already living in the small town of Bainbridge, New Hampshire when Melanie and Michael Gold moved into the house next door.Gus Harte was a warm and decisive woman, very outgoing in manner, and it was mostly through her efforts that the strong friendship between the two families developed.This friendship was suddenly shattered by a tragic event that occurred between their two teen age children, Chris Harte and Emily Gold,who had known each other literally from birth and had gone from a brother-sister relationship to a more serious one of young love.    Jodi Picoult is one of my favorite authors. She has a deep insight into human relationships. Her characterizations are real and her plots believable.In this book she shows that parents sometimes have such strong expectations for their children they overlook or fail  to see the more obvious indications of what is actually occurring in their children's lives. The reader of this book quickly finds involvement in the plot and perhaps a hint of what might have or could have happened in his/her own life.Alma Winters, Author Once Upon a Time Tales
0765322889|2.0|With most fantasy books there is a \\"learning curve\\" where the reader has to find out about the world so they can follow the plot and characters. In this book, that takes 250 pages. If I hadn't been on vacation with nothing else to read, I never would have made it that far. It gets interesting after page 250, but it's still confusing and I never cared about the characters. Erikson has created an extensive plot with tons of characters but in this book he lacks the skill to weave them all together into a coherent and engaging narrative. Hopefully he pulls it off in the next book in this series. I hate to see all that potential go to waste.
B003JTHETY|5.0|i got this cd by pawning off items that i hardly used anymore (buying this cd wasn't my only priority, getting gas was first, and cigarettes were next) and it was well worth pawning off the junk i had laying around. the only cd i have of maidens \\"newer\\" stuff is a matter of life and death, and that was a good cd, but this cd here blows that one out of the water. i really didnt need to get the limited edition tin can version, but i got it anyways because the packaging was cool (plus it is a \\"limited edition\\" which means there are gonna be tons of them around not being sold). im only disappointed that i missed seeing maiden in dc on the 20th of last month. i hope they come through again next year, cause i would love to hear these songs live. my favorite songs have to be so far:  mother of mercy  the alchemist  coming home  satellite 15  starblind  and el dorado    the rest of the songs are good, but the ones i listed i like the best.
1439181780|4.0|I have been a fan of \\"power of mind\\" material for years.  I have read dozens of books on the subject, from classics like Think and Grow Rich, which I've read several times, to newer and relatively unknown books on the subject, such as [[ASIN:1608420027 The Rich Switch - The Simple 3-Step System to Turn on Instant Wealth Using the Law of Attraction]], which I just found out about and finished yesterday.      In short, I feel I have a lot of perspective on the subject and hope this perspective will make this review helpful. :)    The main question people seem to be asking is, \\"Is The Power as good as the Secret?\\"  The answer to that is, \\"Maybe.\\"  It may be that missing link that really puts everything together for you.  Or maybe not!   Regardless, it's a good book and worth buying, in my opinion.     I think the Secret was great because it simplified the Law of Attraction.  The book, and especially the movie, did a nice job of breaking everything down into an easy-to-understand concept.  Unfortunately, that was also its downfall.      As The Secret became more and more popular, people who hadn't read the material that it was based on took everything the book said at face value.  That's why so many people say that The Secret is too materialistic or that it resulted in a lot of self-absorbed people.  In many ways, it was only half the story.    I feel The Power does a good job of fixing this situation by showing the true power of the Law of Attraction, which isn't getting a new car, or bike for the kid, or anything to do with money.  The true power of the Law of Attraction, in my opinion, is about making big changes in the way people live their lives and control their own destinies.  In fact, a better title for this book would have been The EmPOWERment, because that's really what it's about.    So what's in the book?    The format is very similar to the Secret.   Here are some examples:    - What is the Power?  - The Power of Feelings  - Feeling is Creation  - Keys to Power  - The Power and Money  - The Power and Relationships  - The Power and Health  - The Power and You  - The Power and Life    The Best Part - Each section has a nice list of bullet points called \\"Points of Power.\\"  This is a great way to review the section and take what Rhonda Byrne talks about from theory into action.     The Worst Part - I really feel the book would have benefited by having additional authors.  The Power has thoughts of other people, but mostly just short quotes.      Rhonda Byrne is ok at explaining everything, but it's always nice to hear other people give their takes.  There are a lot of ways to approach what she is talking about and different explanations would have been helpful.      Because The Power contains just her perspective, I feel this book, while ok, is missing some of the \\"magic\\" that the Secret had.  For that, I'm knocking off a star.    Who will benefit from this book?    I think anybody who loved the Secret will like this one.  People looking to improve their current relationships, or attract new relationships.  People looking to make peace with money and bring more of it into their lives.  People looking to take control of their health.  People who want to live their best life possible.  Entrepreneurs and others who want to change the world.    It's a good book!
B003A4IFGY|5.0|A great album that gets better each time I listen. The music is mature, bluesy and rockin' -- and Mike Campbell shows what makes him a true guitar god. To quote another reviewer: \\"Play it loud, play it often...\\"
B002NXSRX4|4.0|This movie isn't nearly as bad as most people are saying.  The movie isn't meant to be a serious action movie.  It's based on an 80's cartoon series.  The acting is mostly terrible, so if this kind of thing bothers you, then the movie may not be for you.  But if you like campy one-liners and impossible situations then you may enjoy this.  Just watch it in the right spirit and this is a fun movie.    On blu-ray, the picture quality is phenomenal!  Everything is super crisp and colorful.  Sound quality is also very nice.  I watched the DVD version of this movie before buying the blu-ray and the difference is HUGE!
B003S897U0|5.0|An opportunity to hear some new perspectives on older songs that you know and love!

B002DKF582|4.0|Remastered version of this ENO classic, but not gatefold version which I thought I had purchased? No bonus tracks either, but the sound is very good. One of the things that make this a classic is the make-up of the studio band as we all know. A must have for ENO fans.
0307474712|5.0|It took me a while to finally pick up ONE DAY.  For some reason I was worried it would be a bit too contrived, too cute for its own good.  Suffice it to say, my assumption was proven wrong by year two, 1989.  This was savored.  Put down at appropriate moments -- chapter breaks -- because I just couldn't let it end.  Then, once it did end, I sat on the beach and just gazed at the waves.  Sad -- SO SAD -- to say goodbye to these well-developed, beautifully flawed characters, characters who constantly reflected the humanity I see every day.  Sure, I laughed out-loud numerous times, but in the end, ONE DAY left me pensive, even melancholy. Of course, such an emotional wallop is the hallmark of great literature!    On a final note:  DO NOT READ TOO MANY AMAZON REVIEWS -- especially the negative ones -- AS THEY ARE LOADED WITH SPOILERS.  This is not a book to have spoiled.
0470601787|5.0|Some of us listen better with a pen or pencil in our hands. A lot of us probably got chastised for this in school -- I certainly did. If you're like me, inside this book you'll find not only a whole support group for your doodling habits, but an explanation for why drawing while listening (or watching someone draw while listening) actually makes it easier to follow a conversation and to retain what was said. It's also a wonderful introduction to the field of visual practice.<br /><br />Visual Meetings is written in a clear, concise style. It explains how to facilitate meetings and engage groups in a whole new way. If you are already a facilitator, this book will take you the rest of the way to start doing it visually. If you are a beginning facilitator, there are lots of tips to help you grow more confident and skilled. And if you're thinking \\"but I can't draw,\\" don't worry! You can do everything in this book too. Step-by-step descriptions tell you how to do everything from developing a basic visual vocabulary, to hanging large sheets of paper, to managing groups of all sizes and kinds. It's a great resource for practicing visual facilitators, too. I recommend it very highly.
B003JTHESA|5.0|First off let me say I have been an Iron Maiden fan since 1979 and I've been to almost every tour ( including this years ). Iron Maiden never really disappoint me although the Blaze era did ( but that's my opinion )I'm a Bruce fanboy!<br /><br />Now to the new album. I love the way it starts off with the tribal sounding drums, not your same run of the mill intros like Maiden has done on countless albums \\"Bravo\\"<br />I'm not going to review every song, but my highlights are as follows:<br />Mother of Mercy<br />Isle of Avalon<br />Starblind ( Love this one very 70's prog sounding)<br />Satellite 15<br />The Talisman<br />The Alchemist<br />El Dorado<br /><br />The other songs are good, but they just haven't stood out to me yet, this is a long album and will take a few listens to grow on you. I've had the album for 2 weeks now. I like it it more than Dance of Death, but less than Brave New World if that makes sense to you all.<br /><br />I know there will be people with their own opinions on this a \\"slow\\" album at times and Maiden use the same formula, but how many bands do?<br /><br />anyway I am enjoying the new album and hope Maiden continue touring and making music for yrs to come!<br /><br />Up The Irons !

0307454541|5.0|I think I have found the perfect combination of literary genre in Stieg Larsson's novel The Girl With The Dragon Tattoo.  At the very least I have found the perfect combination for me.  Judging from its popularity, however, I would say that I'm not the only one who is devouring the first of a trilogy of mystery novels.  The mystery is clear:  What happened to Harriet Vanger?  Was she murdered, kidnapped or did she just plain run away from a complicated and difficult family? In addition to these questions and almost right beside them is a thorough characterization of almost every person in the story.  So much effort did Mr. Larsson devote to making the reader get to know his people that they almost become the story.  Either way, the book is a damned good read.  I can't wait to start reading The Girl Who Played With Fire, book number two of the trilogy and the next to the last book the author completed before he died.
030726999X|2.0|It is hard for me to be critical of Stieg Larsson after I was so taken by the first two \\"The Girl\\" books, but this is disappointing.  Mr. Larsson devotes so much space to a boring explanation of the Swedish intelligence community, while keeping his most compelling character lying in a hospital bed.  There is no action except about 20% through and at the end.  This novel does not keep you turning pages and following the twists and turns and unexpected happenings like the first two.

B003JTHESA|5.0|The Final Frontier is an amazing album.  It's very complex, and it'll take a few listens before you really get it, but even on the first listen the songs stand out.  If you didn't like their last album(A Matter of Life and Death) that much, rest assured that this is a lot better. The rhythms are overall higher tempo and more complex. There are a bunch of really good choruses(mother of mercy and starblind keep getting stuck in my head), and the songs tend to use a bunch of different riffs to keep things fresh. The songs feel a lot shorter than they actually are(another massive improvement from AMOLAD)    Suggestion: Don't try to listen to this album all at once, it's too much to take in.      Notable songs:ALL OF THEM.  The first 2(The Final Frontier and El Dorado) are the simplest on the album and in some ways the worst(but still great).  Isle of Avalon is particularly hard to get into.    The last song, Where The Wild Wind Blows, is incredible.  It's not too aggressive, and is actually fairly appropriate even for people who are new to metal.  It's filled with epic riffs and the guitar solo quality is top-notch.    The vocal melodies are notably great here.
030726999X|5.0|All three of Steig's books were great reading.  I enjoyed the story.  Closing the last book was like taking a good friend to the airport at the end of a fabulous visit.  I am sad that the author is dead and cannot share more of his writing with me.
1595141715|5.0|I wont go into the description of the book too much. Basically the novel is about a girl who records 13 reasons why she is choosing to end her life. She sends these tapes to the 13 people who contributed greatly to her deciding to end her life.   So many people are screaming in protest over the book saying that it is horrible that Hannah should not be more accountable for her own actions. The thing that these people don't recognize about suicide is that it is not usually the ones who have horrible home lives that end up committing suicide. The young people who are far more likely to commit suicide are those who are basically alienated and treated like crap by their peers. Your peers are the people who make you feel like you're accepted into the world, like you're good enough to be around and included, like you're worthy of their time and like your efforts are worth it.   The entire premise of this book isn't just the specific events but the fact that when something piles so heavily on someone there often times seems to be no escape. I am a psychologist and I work with teens all of the time and the ones that have the hardest time with mental illness are the ones who are alienated and unwelcome with their peers. They feel like they never stand a chance of being seen as normal, part of the group, and worthy of friendship.  I don't think that Hannah blames it 100% on the 13 people at all. I think she is simply pointing out that having, metaphorically speaking, 12 people basically strip you of everything you need in life, love, safety, respect, etc how can a person keep their own idea of who they really are in tact?   This book is about making people aware of the long term consequences of their actions. For those of you who don't recognize that Hannah took responsibility for her actions please read the book again because she does. She's simply saying that they lead her to the point in which she felt she had to make the choice.
B003JTHETY|3.0|This album is very good i know all the maiden fans will like, if you like the direction from brave new world to a matter of.. this album is for you.  The sound of the album is like the cover a improve in a new direction to the future of progressive music with a little of old maiden stuff.i was looking for more speed like aces high and other like seven son of. and for me is a little late down in that way of making that classic heavy metal. to finish bruce dickinson has lost the good old way he used to sing from the era number of. to fear of the dark, now he sing the same way from the beginning to end  he used to change the way of singing in every new album back in the days, but he still has the range and he deliver anyway also is in his 50 now so with that in mind is in good shape. iron maiden has a new record old fan o new fan buy it, is good and you definitely will enjoy it  up the iron.
0061537969|4.0|Not my usual choice for a book, but recommended by a friend so I read it. Loved how the story is written from a dog's point of view-what a great idea! It gave me a whole new perspective when I interact with my own dogs now! Wonder what they're feeling and thinking! I can't say that I loved the references to race car driving, but I get the necessary analogies and understand their significance in the story. I cried at the end (always a good sign that the book hit you in the right place), but I'm a weinie when it comes to animal stories. I did notice some timeline errors as I finished the book, but nothing that distracted from the story. Not something I would have picked up on my own, but definitely glad it was recommended. Enjoyed every minute.
0345477618|5.0|Love Star Wars? Want to know everything about how the movie came to be made? Buy this book.<br /><br />A must-own book for any Star Wars fan, period.
140191716X|5.0|When I received my book of Daily Guidance from your angels I was astonished by the beauty of the book, its cover, colors, elegance and better of all, its incredible and precious messages that have filled my life with colors.  This book exceded my expectations.  I definitely recommend it!!
B003JTHESA|5.0|Worth the 4 year wait. Definately a good album!!! Is it 80's Maiden? No. Do most fans want to hear The Number of the Beast Act #41? No. It's time to stop comparing newer Maiden to 80's. Since 95, this ISN'T, nor will it ever be, the same band again.     1st 5 tracks are really good rocking songs. Mother of Mercy, Coming Home & The Alchemist are very good! The song Sat 15...Final Frontier is bipolar & El Dorado is decent. 2nd half of the album, things get longer & trippier. Some say Progressive and some say not. WHO CARES! The music is inspired but slower paced. This doesn't make it bad, it means it's different! Maiden are so talented, I love hearing them jam out on this album. Every song on the 2nd half has the traditional post 2000 Maiden intro but, the songs really break out into a late 70's infused rock jam. At times, it doesn't even sound like them.     The guitars REALLY shine on this record(especially Adrian) as does Nikko on drums. One of his best performances! Bruce is getting up in age and he comes over a lil strained at times. But, he is in his early 50's! It's the best post reunion album imo and I would even take this ahead of Somewhere in Time. Enjoy the listen, it's a ride!
B003ITZBVI|5.0|To put it simply, the story hear is much better than the one that was in the comics.   No Superboy BS. No unraveling reality. Just a good gritty, violent, Batman story.  I voted for Jason to die back in the 80's. I hated him as Robin, but I LOVE him as the Red Hood.
B003JTHESA|5.0|At the first listen or two, you'd think to yourself, I hate this album, but then you will get a grip of this album and how deep it is.<br />Songs like Coming home and When The Wild Wind Blows is my top 2.<br />The other songs like the Talisman and Isle of Avalon are kinda new to Iron Maiden fans but are still solid and Bruce's voice is a great as we expect him to be.<br /><br />Give it time and believe me you will love it.
B003QCCS36|5.0|Ray's vocals shine once again as he releases his 4th studio album, and I'll be honest it doesn't disappoint. The production is toned down on this album compared to Gossip which had a lot going on to me. The sound/song writing is more similar to LaMontagne's first two albums in my opinion. Highlights include:    \\"This Love is Over\\": hauntingly beautiful and reminds us how much emotion Ray can put into his vocals    \\"God Willin'\\": one of the best on the album, production is awesome songwriting props for this one    \\"For the Summer\\": probably my second favorite, sentimental and just all around great    \\"Rock 'N Roll & the Radio\\": my favorite off the album, Ray sings to your soul in this fabulously written song with a passionate performance. One of my favorite songs of his ever.    All in all this CD has not helped me rank LaMontagne's albums being now I cannot choose my favorite out of this one and his first two. Fantastic album, a leap up from Gossip in my opinion which I didn't love and probably going to be one of the best of the year for me!
B003JTHETY|5.0|'Nuff said. I like the direction Maiden has been going since Brave New World, and The Final Frontier, aside from being a tight, interesting, progressive album, is no doubt just a transition album to something greater. From hoping to hear Satellite 15...The Final Frontier live to the goosebumps of When the Wild Wind Blows...just simply a great experience that gets better with each listening. I really hope they play this entire album live, because it would be amazing.     As a closure, all the professional reviews are spot on. If you like what they say, you'll like the album.
B000OPPBEQ|4.0|I love these movies and thought it'd be nice to treat myself to the blu-ray collection, seeing as my old box set of regular dvds had become hopelessly scattered and misplaced. I got this on sale for about [...] bucks during black friday week last year, and was quite pleased with that. The box itself looks great, all shiny and with holographic green matrix code all over it. The video quality is wonderful, and the sound is simply amazing (not to mention the hours of commentary and bonus features).    My only problem with it is this JUST has blu-ray disks in it. Yes, I did order a blu-ray collection, I understand that. But how much are regular digital copies? A couple bucks? Just throw them in there. I can't take these over my friends houses, hell I can't even watch them in my room, only the tv in my living room has a blu-ray player hooked up to it. This would have been 5 stars if digital copies had been included.
0786886811|5.0|In every kitchen there are essential staples that allow you to create really great food and without which no kitchen would be complete.    This book is one of those staples. Every recipe sounds delicious but unlike some books, this one actually delivers every time.    Because this is the sort of book that you can rely on without fear of disappointment, and because of the quality of writing and the recipes themselves, I highly recommend it and I have bought it as presents for friends who all agree.    I keep coming back to the carrot cake muffins and the chocolate brownies recipes again and again-they're absolutely divine! People say to me they're the best they've ever tasted. Try them for yourself and see.
B002ZG983M|5.0|Make no mistake, this is on kick-ass movie. I never go to the theater, always buy used DVD copies, but after watching the previews I couldn't hold back any longer and bought it New at full price. It was worth every penny. Kick-ass 2 Balls to the Wall will be in theaters in 2012, not since the end of Kill Bill vol 1 have I anticipated a sequel more than this.
0316548189|5.0|Nelson Mandella \\"writes\\", unlike some so called authors who fill pages up to make readers think there is some substance...  After watching the movie Invictus, I was compelled to find out more about this man's influence in the destruction of Apartheid in So. Africa.  Wow! Would you edure as much as he and come out of prison after so many years as HE? I respect Nelson even more.
B002ZG9788|3.0|Tis movie, truth be told, wasn't all that bad.  It's really cool looking on blu-ray in the secenes with the gods in their throne room. Let's be honest here though, would anyone really want to see this movie if it were a scene by scene remake.  I mean the one thing I hated about the remake of Halloween, other than it sucked, was the last 30 mins.  Trust me that was actually the best part of that whole movie. But why in the world would I want to see the same movie I've seen before, just 30 years later.  I believe most of the people who hate these kinds of movie hate it because it's nothing like the original.  Honestly, if it were like the original than why would you want to watch it.  I loved the original when I was a kid, it was my favorite movie.  I for one actually like the fact that even some of the parts were the same, that it was told a little different. I agree with somone else who made a comment abotuh Worthington. I mean where in the world did this guy come from.  He had a big part in Terminator, and he's in every movie now.  I remember someone else who just came out of no where, and that was Hugh Jackman. Where has that guy gone to.  Like I said I liked the improved look of all the monsters. I thought they were neat looking, but if you ae looked for the exact same movie as 30 years ago, you are looking in the wrong place.  Just take the movie for what it's worth.  I personally hate all the remake crap, but this movie wasn't all that bad. Just compare it to Death Proof.
0307473708|3.0|I watched Seasons 1-3 of Dexter before reading this book. Big mistake.     This first book is nearly identical to the first season of Dexter (with a few minor changes [i.e. some people die that remain alive in the show] ). I found it to be incredibly boring since I basically already knew what was going to happen.     If you've already watched the first season on Showtime, you won't miss anything by skipping this book and going right into Dearly Devoted Dexter. I'm glad I continued on with the book series, as they get much more interesting after this first book (and the series on TV doesn't follow it at all).
B003JTHESA|5.0|Maiden is back again!!  The only thing is, they never left.  I've never known a band that has been around for 30+ years to only get better with time, but Maiden defies all odds.  They did it again.  For the most part all of Maiden's peers from the 80's can't even come close to what they were able to do back then, but thanks to Steve Harris's work ethic and the rest of the band of course, Maiden puts out as solid of an album as ever. The Final Frontier is no exception.  Pick this bad boy up!  You get your money's worth
B000F3T7R4|4.0|This album was quite an eye opener when Geffen finally made it available on CD about a decade after its original release on vinyl. `Trouble' was the first official full length outing for a band previous known as David Coverdale's Whitesnake. Though they would drop the singer's name from the band's moniker there was no doubt who was the leader and driving force of this British supergroup. However during the first five years or so, the band's lineup was remarkably steady compared with the later hair metal configurations. The music was also much closer to the rhythm and blues of Coverdale's musical upbringing then the glamfests from 1987 on to the present.  I have always preferred this version of Whitesnake to the MTV/Tawny Kitean era and I thought David seemed to filling not only Deep Purple's void but Free and Bad Company's as well.  The title track and \\"Love to Keep You Warm\\" could have been early Paul Rodgers belters as they carry a similar vibe. \\"Take Me with You\\", \\"Nighthawk\\" and \\"Don't Mess with Me\\" are clearly from the school of Deep Purple which makes even more sense as by the time of `Trouble''s gestation, Jon Lord was tickling the ivories (Ian Paice would join two LP's later). If you became a fan during the \\"Still of the Night\\" era, `Trouble' may not be for you but if you love Coverdale's voice and his work with Purple, then get it.
1439181780|2.0|This book is like one of those poor and uninspiring sequels that follow successful films. After watching it you feel you've been cheated out of the money you paid for the cinema ticket. I had the same bad taste left in my mouth from this book. It's full of half baked psychology and rehashed ideas from the first book.  If you're looking for pukka help you'd better get a professional book and if you're just after light entertainment then go for that but not for a book that pretends to be both but is neither.    Books I enjoyed recently are [[ASIN:1449597300 Queen Sheba's Ring]], [[ASIN:1449594565 The Drum]] and [[ASIN:144956268X The Life of Apollonius of Tyana]].
0393072231|3.0|I found The Big Short to be slightly below par when compared to Liar's Poker, Moneyball, and The Blindside.      Lewis does a great job, as usual, in explaining the complex financial instruments involved in this story and their consequences to financial markets.  However, in this book he seems to explain the same instrument several times to fill pages.    The book focuses on a few \\"small\\" investors and hedge funds that saw the subprime crash coming a made bets against the subprime mortgage market. Lewis makes this book relatable to the average Joe by finding underdog characters in this mess and telling their stories. The book also explains the steps that the larger hedge funds and investment banks made to make this problem worse and their incompetence during these transactions.      Lewis makes his feeling on these banks very clear. Lewis possesses amazing transparency on the interworkings of several banks but had gotten little or no information of the interworkings of others, notably Goldman Sachs.  Lewis seems to take it easy on banks he had inside info about but he is very harsh to banks that left him in the dark.    There is also a chapter that contains the story of a lunch Lewis recently had with Jon Gutfreund, Lewis's villain in the book Liar's Poker.  This portion of the book is great and will be enjoyed by anyone who has read Liar's poker.    Overall I would recommend reading this book to anyone who wants to have a better understanding of the credit crisis and its root causes.  However, if you are expecting Lewis at his best you will be disappointed.

B003JTHESA|1.0|This band that has co-opted the Iron Maiden name should cease and desist immediately. This is a boring,tedious, non Maiden sounding album. Just because a song is 11 minutes long or a disc is over an hour does not make it a masterpiece. If they recorded Bruce on the toilet for 76 minutes I fear many of you would say the same thing... \\"groundbreaking, original stuff\\". These three minute preludes into the same slow to midtempo 8 minute plus songs are an absolute embarrassment. It is quite evident since their last lame effort that the original ideas are gone, the musicianship is not on par with quality Maiden discs  and as someone earlier posted, it doesnt even sound like Maiden. This is a sorry, worn out, faded representation of what once was a great band.   All you have to do is listen to Dance of Death from a few years ago and then this steaming pile and you tell me with a straight face that this is their best work ever or some other fanboy nonsense. We all know this is terrible, uninspired, prog rock garbage that should be in the discount bin right about... now. It is hard for some  to accept that this band is bereft of ideas and needs to hang it up immediately.  Lets all hope this is indeed the final frontier so as to not further stain the once unquestioned legacy of a once great, groundbreaking band.
B001GKJ2E8|5.0|An accounting manager, who finds his life extemely boring and without any purpose, encounters a gang of assassins who recruited him to execute a series of assassinations ending with the mission of assassinating Kross, their ultimate nemesis. The training he receives is so good and hard that makes him a great assassin in no time, and when he finally meets Kross he realizes the ultimate truth about his destiny and purpose!    The story is great with a wonderful twist in the end!    The direction is breath taking.
0385504225|1.0|As a text book relating historical events about the Masons or depicting the symbolism incorporated into the  construction of many of the buildings and memorials in Washington D.C., the book had some merit. The plot,   however,was very weak and the ending was beyond disappointing. Dan Brown needs to lighten up on the various   symbols and codes that have dominated his most famous books, and make certain that he has created a cohesive  plot which he can develop, before he starts another book. He really is a good writer, but this book was mostly  a 500 page waste of time.
B001KEHAI0|2.0|Movie skipped during playing. Really disappointed. This is my husband's favorite movie and we were really looking forward to watching it.
1400052173|4.0|I really enjoyed this book.  I guess what made it enjoyable is the depth to which the author went to get it right.  Her tenacity and honest relationships with the family members absolutely struck me.
0425188809|5.0|Like some of the others comments also stated, this book can be highly addictive. After I red this one I just needed to read more from Koontz. I've probably red dozens after this one.<br /><br />This book is on of the best fiction works I've ever had to pleasure to read. I really felt like was in the middle of the story and I could just feel the way Travis was experiencing this story. Also the ending was just great.<br /><br />Highly recommended to those of you who want to read an exciting book by a master writer. I can't remember another book that gave me so much pleasure while reading it in my free time.
0321344758|5.0|That pretty much sums it up.     The chapters are very well organized. Though this book covers a lot of material, it is done in a logical and concise manner. His points are reinforced through great examples that pick apart what is good and bad, or can be improved upon.     And it made me laugh while I learned. This guy certainly must be top dog in web design if his book is any indication.
0439023483|5.0|At first I was reluctant to read \\"The Hunger Games\\", a novel about a futuristic world where life as we know it does not exist and a sadistic, controlling Capitol governs the 12 districts of Panem, the country that makes up what was once known as North America. But since I like to be in the know and the final book in the trilogy is getting a ton of buzz, my curiosity got the better of me. Once I started, I didn't stop reading until I finished it.     Katniss Everdeen lives in District 12, where her fellow citizens mine coal as their contribution to the Capitol. Katniss, only sixteen years old, lives with her younger sister, Prim, and her mother, a woman who has not recovered from the mine explosion that killed her husband a few years ago. By hunting in the woods with her friend, Gale, and trading to the local merchants, she keeps her family alive and well-fed. The book opens with Katniss attending the reaping, an annual event where two children (one boy, one girl) between the ages of 12 and 18 are chosen to represent their district in \\"The Hunger Games\\". The event pits 24 tributes against each other in an elaborately constructed arena and the games only end when one child is left standing. The games are consequence for previous rebellions and a harsh reminder to the districts that the Capitol is in charge. If they act out, they will become as nonexistent as District 13.    At the reaping, Katniss volunteers herself in place of her younger sister who is chosen to participate. Katniss travels to the Capitol with her fellow nominee, Peeta Mellark, a boy with an unusual connection to her past. Coming from a poverty stricken district, Katniss encounters a strange way of life at the Capitol and although she has grown up watching The Hunger Games on television, participating opens her world to the savage practices of those who rule over Panem.     The action and events in \\"The Hunger Games\\" are disgusting, tense, and sad beyond belief, but that's a testament to the author'stalent as a writer. Even though the future world of Panem is devoid of many things we live with today, it still contains the loving bonds people create with one another, even under the most dire circumstances imaginable. Suzanne Collins deserves every ounce of praise she has received for the book and I thank her for creating a strong, sensible, brave, and fascinating character in Katniss Everdeen.
B003JTHESA|3.0|[[VIDEOID:moSKMO42MWU2VL]]Listen: [...]<br /><br />On their fifteenth studio album, Iron Maiden has refined the progressive elements they relied on with 2006's A Matter of Life and Death. Many of the intros and instrumental passages are drawn out, but they add more to the songs than they take away. My biggest issue with the album is Bruce's voice. It's really the only part of the band that shows any age. He can't hit the highs like he used to. And though the strain is only apparent on a handful of tracks, the spots where it does show up are ruined. Examples include bits of \\"Mother of Mercy\\" and \\"Starblind.\\" There are even points where Bruce runs himself breathless by writing more lyrics than he can chew.<br /><br />All that aside, the songwriting is still catchy and detailed. The production could certainly be better, but there's still a love of exploration and adventure in this band's songwriting; plus, Maiden is easily the best-looking when it comes to their contemporaries. I'd rather listen to this 40 times before I listen to a new Ozzy album once, that's for sure.<br /><br />The band is still kicking and still relevant.
B0035V35PI|5.0|The bottom line is, if you like sword play, throwing stars and all that stuff, buy this movie.  You will not be disappointed.  The special effects, awesome and that's why I give it 5 stars.

1416589473|5.0|I have been an avid Guild Wars fan since the Prophecies beta days.  When I heard that this book was in the works, I knew I had to pre-order it.  From start to finish, this is a fun adventure that remains faithful to the lore of the video games.  While it's definitely a page turner, some parts did feel glossed over and begged for more detail.  The plot progressed naturally, but the end did wrap up rather quickly (not necessarily a bad thing).  Perhaps there will be a sequel...?  Overall, the authors did a great job breathing life into the new world (I loved the map and timeline at the beginning), and the character development was everything I expected it to be.  It was very exciting to see the direction GW2 is taking.  Can't wait for more!
1439181780|5.0|I am reading the Power and I can tell you that this book is about L O V E ! In The Power, Rhonda Byrne talks about the power of love. She goes beyond positive thinking and explains how our feelings influence our capacity to attract what we want. The main point of this book is about the power of love and its effect upon the creation process.    This looks like a simple book, but as you go through and read it you will notice this book's idea is to stretch your mind into new levels of attraction of the things you do want.     Rhonda has put a great deal of love into this book. You can feel the love she has put into it as you dig deeper into it.     I don't usually write reviews, however I am writing this review to offer Rhonda Byrne my deepest gratitude for her putting together her first book called The Secret - as I apply the processes taught in The Secret into my life I see the positive results and my life has changed for the better in so many levels!    The Power does not present readers with a to-do list or a recipe that tells you how to get from point A to point B and how to reach your life goals, but if you are willing to tap into the power of love and use it to change your life, then The Power it is the book for you.    The Power comes in a book format that at first sight may look like as if it's designed for the female public alone, but it isn't.     I think the message within The Power comes in a time when I need to feel grateful and let the love show much more for the good and important things that I already have in my life!    The greatest idea I have grasped from The Power is that I have to stretch my mind a lot more to get the things I want in life, and I thank Rhonda Byrne for her teachings!    Another reviewer wrote that people in other parts of the world won't be able to change their lives. In fact, different parts of the world have different challenges. Other countries may not have a lot of resources and opportunities, but then again a powerful messagewithin The Power is a challenge to its readers to give out love. Rhonda tells in this book about times when she had barely anything and she would still give out what she had.     We can make a positive difference. We can share the L O V E we have in our hearts by acting in kindness!

0307271862|3.0|I just finished reading this book. Mankell is one of my favorite authors, so I was thrilled when I won this book on GLUE. As a thriller, it is not a mystery to the end, rather you know the who pretty early on in the book. It is more the why, based in history and political context that is the basis for the mystery. I loved reading the very interesting fictional view of today's China and what they might be up to. Reminding me of the history of China and American relations in the context of a good mystery was much more interesting than my history teacher ever was. Was it my favorite Mankell mystery? No it wasn't. But it was still an enjoyable read for anyone that likes historically based fiction with political intrigue.

B001LF4ARC|3.0|Overall this book is not written too well with a lot of repetitions and badly organized chapters. I had a hard time reaching any conclusion after each chapter which did have a sensational title, but the content did not follow the context. Also most of the stories were picked up from newspapers and interviews of Steve Jobs's and the writer kept quoting from the same two or three interviews throughout the book. It seemed that he had not done any major research into the company or personally interviewed any of its executives to truly capture the inspirational leadership qualities of Steve Jobs.    On a more positive note, I did enjoy reading or should I say re-reading, the stories of how he came back to apple and took control of company by creating a culture of excellence and greatly reducing the product line-up to be simple and high quality.
B002VECLVO|5.0|This was simply a beautiful love story.  It addresses the grief and despair of the loss of a loved one.  It has nothing to do with  homosexual or straight.  It is just a love story.  Acting superb.  Highly recommend.
B003JTHESA|4.0|A very good album and, I'd say, it has so much music in it! Probably needs a few listens to fully appreciate it. May be it's not as powerful as 'the matter...' but still it's Maiden and it says it all
B003GDYN24|4.0|I ventured myself into new territory with kelis, just word of mouth, but the record is amazing, cutting edge and so far from Beyoncé that's great to know some R&B stars have real artistic vision.  A Capella is a perfect song!
0756405890|5.0|Rarely have I read a fantasy novel as of late that moved me with intensity.  This one did.  Its not the plot (although I assure you it does leave me with questions and wanting more) It is the writing.  Its not the style per se, or the words, or anything any particular.  It is it's earnestness.  I feel the passion that Kvothe uses to tell his story to Chronicler.  I buy it, it doesn't feel like a gimic, or a cliche.  I feel like a kid listening to war story being told passionately by my grandfather.  I feel the passion as he talks about Denna, and I feel the sorry when he talks about loss.  Making me feel emotions while reading is no mean feat but he does it.  When I read this book I felt emotionally drained.  Not because this because was so overly emotional, but because I felt those emotions rather than just reading about someone feeling them.
0393072231|4.0|I thought the book in general was \\"sensational\\" and gave an exciting and fast paced view of the financial industry. I had heard about the credit default swaps and how the became the financial instruments of \\"mass\\" destruction, but reading the insider's scoop was a learning experience. Few people in the world had the nerves to go against the crowd and put their money where their mouth was. His approach to follow the lives of four very different money managers who staked almost everything they had on this one bet was an excellent idea. It not only gave budding money managers an insight into how they can bet but also how they can penetrate the system to get what the want. The very fact that these people had to go out there and actually \\"invent\\" these credit default swaps shows that there is still room for innovation and extra-ordinary gain in the financial industry.     I was surprised that some of the smartest people in the country were acting so stupidly. How can you take triple-B tranches, break them up and now call them triple-A tranches after mixing in some pretty stuff. Its like putting lipstick on a pig. It all goes to show that you cannot trust anybody - even the rating agencies! For decades people have relied on their numbers and their notes, however they can no longer be taken at face value. One must combine common sense with available literature and analysis to form a picture and invest accordingly.     Lewis's writing style always aggrandizes the current situation and gives the reader a \\"humanistic\\" view of the events that were happening. I am sure at some points he exaggerated the emotions and at others downplayed them - all in all it was a page turner. I read the whole book in one sitting, granted I was on a 15 hour flight with nothing better to do.

0756405890|2.0|Someone told me to try this now I can't stop. It's amazing!    But really, this book is fun but not great. The hero is a super smart super dude, who is good at everything, and tries to save the ladies from tough spots, while putting down bullies. Nerd wish fulfillment, but better written than most. The world building and magic system was kind of fun, so I'll pick up the sequel.

B002ZG977Y|2.0|It seems to be that lately we have been inundated with a rash of movies that are perfectly content with being decent, but not great. Particularly this year I was left the movie theatre feeling that I was entertained, but that what I saw was just missing something. Maybe movie makers don't really want to take chances anymore, and they like to retread the same old formulas out there because they are safe. They would rather a movie be safely average and make money than take chances on greatness and have a bomb. I don't know that I really fault them for this logic. Great movies don't always equal more money, or even any money at all. Greatness in film is often not appreciated by the masses and the benign blockbuster film with good advertising generally is. In fact a couple of movie insiders from the Scene Unseen Movie review podcast often have said that the key to making money with a movie actually has nothing to do with its quality, only the quality of its advertising. This movie has that sort of thing going for it to a certain degree. They advertised the fooey out of this thing. Lots of epic shots of monsters and of Liam Neeson saying \\"Release the Kraken.\\" This movie was going to make a decent amount of bank just because of the advertising campaign, and recoup a lot of its making costs. Once again I can't really fault the movie companies for this, it does make them money. However, I really don't like it when the advertising is the best part of the film, and when the trailers give a false impression as to the plot of the movie. (in this film its who the primary antagonist is) On the whole I didn't leave the theatre feeling that I hadn't enjoyed my time, I found the film enjoyable enough, and I didn't feel like it was wasted. Its not a bad movie and I wouldn't tell people that they shouldn't see it if they like this type of film. But it was a decidedly average film, not great and the question I keep asking myself is with this wealth of source material how can you not make a great film? I mean seriously this is a remake of an already pretty darn good film, so they can only go up from there right? This film does a few things right. The period people (although no more accurate than any other movie) felt right. I bought into the fact that these were an ancient people. The costumes looked really good, with the exception of Zeus' light can't quite focus on you armor, which just looked silly and cheesy. Sam Worthington, although not exceptional, gave a far better turn than he did in Avatar, and his performance was solid. Ralph Fiennes was as freaky and scary as he always is in these roles, and frankly I think the movie could have benefitted from more of his. Liam Neeson was fine, but he wasn't really given all that much to do. Zeus was actually far less epic and frequent in the film that the trailers would have you believe. Once again, not Neeson's fault, and he wasn't bad, aside from his terrible armor, he just wasn't given much to do. The movie did a few things badly that really detracted from the film. Firstly, I immediately got popped out with believability with Sam Worthington in this role. I know he was a demi-God, and physically stronger and all of that, but young Perseus has a conversation with his adopted father when he was, at the oldest ten. Then it pops up 12 years later, and it shows Worthington. I leaned over to my friend that was watching the movie with me and said \\"Huh, 22 years old and he already has crows feet.\\" He responded, \\"hard life man.\\" Its just really hard to buy him as a 20 year old kid. Even a 20 year old demi-god kid. My question is, why pop up the 12 years later subtext at all? It had no bearing to the plot, its not like it wasn't obvious this was sometime in the future, why do it? All it did was make people go huh, that 20 year old looks 35. But that's just a personal peeve of mine, and I am sure that wouldn't annoy most people. Other than that this movie had real problems in production, not so much in the acting and story. It looked like the shot the film with actually 8mm retro color film. Sometimes that's not a bad look, but in this film it kind of made things look washed out, with a lack of vibrancy. Everything kind of looked gray scale and it was not pleasing at all. The monsters looked a little to cartoony for the gravity of the situation, and for you old school gamers the Kraken totally looked like one of the Weapon's bosses from Final Fantasy 7, or even Bahamut from Advent Children. If you haven't seen the original go and see that one instead of this one, it's a better movie, but this one is still entertaining enough despite its flaws, so if this type of movie interests you, then by all means go out and see it. If you love the original, you will probably be disappointed, but if not, you will just have a couple hours of mindless action entertainment.

B00127RAJY|3.0|I like this workout for days when I only have time for a very short workout; however I definitely have WAY better workouts in my (large) collection.  I like Banish Fat, Boost Metabolism, or No More Trouble Zones way better. I  think the suggested rotation for this workout is to do it mostly every day until you feel you can progress??  What about not overusing muscle groups by working them back to back?  Most fitness professionals advise resting in between working the same muscle groups.  Level one is not challenging for me at all, so I tend to do only level 2 or 3.  (I consider myself low advanced, particulary with cardio, more advanced with strength.)  She uses very light weights throughout; I keep several sets nearby so I can switch as needed because using 3 pounds or 5 pounds for the duration just doesn't cut it for me.  I do like Jillian and find her to be pretty positive and encouraging.  This does have a place in my collection, it's just not one I reach for often.
B00003CXZ4|4.0|Mostly Christopher Nolan gets pub for being the man behind Batman Begins and The Dark Knight, but with the popularity of Inception people, are starting to get a handle on the dark twisty directing style that is really his bread and butter. Also, seeing as I am actually unsure yet as to whether I will pay to go see Inception, I decided to temper that by retro reviewing this one.     Memento was not the first movie he directed, but it is the movie that really put him on the map and was his first movie to actually have a cast and a budget. (even though it was a small one) He made some smart casting decisions by casting the always great Guy Pierce as Lenny and surrounding him with a cast of solid supportive character actors. Oddly, he snagged two of the cast from the previous years Sci/Fi smash the Matrix. Carrie-Ann Moss and Joe Pantoliano both had major roles in that movie, and are the two major supporting actors in Memento. They both give excellent performances. Also, you can see a cameo by Jorja Fox in this film as Lenny's wife when she is shown in the flashback scenes. She is more commonly recognized in her role on CSI as Sara Sidle. The acting will not be a disappointment in this film which is important since this is primarily a character and dialogue driven film. Guy Pierce particularly sells this film with his continually ability to make the fact his characters memories keep disappearing believable. The acting however, is not what makes this movie distinctive as a Christopher Nolan vehicle.    What Christopher Nolan loves to do, and does well, is winding a plot that makes it difficult to separate the reality from the fiction. He is striving for more than just a simple plot hook with a twist at the end. He is trying to craft a movie that makes the audience completely engage with the characters, yet been completely in the dark about what is real and what isn't. A Nolan film is unmistakeable in its artistic value. Its dark gritty, and his style is very distinct. Its hard to describe but you know it when you see it and by all accounts Inception might be his opus when it comes to this style and reality bending. But this all started with Memento, which deals with something nearly as fragmentary and illusory as dreams, memory. If you are a lover of the movie Inception, then you owe it to yourself to watch the movie that started Nolan on this path, and if you have seen it then you should go re-watch it, Memento is truly a great movie.
0375842209|4.0|Most wartime stories tell of soldiers.  The Book Thief tells of how children, families and individual civilians struggle to survive war. Despite a grim beginning (the death of a six-year-old boy) and the use of Death as a narrator, The Book Thief ultimately focuses less on loss and more on the gift of human connection.<br /><br />It describes ordinary human beings coping with extraordinary times. Some do so with generosity, others with an eye to personal gain. Whether deserving or not, the privations and bombs of war fall on them all. Some survive. Some don't.<br /><br />The lucky ones are those who have managed to steal a piece of each other's hearts.
B000E1ZBH2|5.0|I've seen different versions of Pride and Prejudice, including the versions with Laurence Olivier and Colin Firth.  None come close to this version.  Even though story had to be condensed to fit the runtime of the movie, the integrity of the story remains.  Keira Knightly is powerful as Elizabeth and Matthew Macfadyen IS the ultimate Darcy.  Donald Sutherland, Judi Dench and Tom Hollander as Mr. Collins are also masterful. The musical score outstanding!  This is a must see!  This is an update.  I don't know how I managed to leave out Brenda Blethyn as Mrs. Bennett.  She was wonderful.
B002ZG98Z0|2.0|As much as I loved the tv show, I was disappointed with both movies.  This one was a little bit better than the first one.  I get so tired of hearing wealthywomen whine that they never have enough of \\"Me time\\" - oh give me a break!  Why get married and have kids if all you want is our own time?  I was happy to see that they sent them overseas to the Middle East.  The scenes from the Middle East were great however, I was a little offended with their sterotypical views on anything Middle Eastern and the view that the Middle Eastern women were \\"happy\\" being housewives and mothers.  However, at least this movie was a little broad minded with Charlotte (who in the first movie refused to drink the water in Mexico, even though they were in a 5 star resort).
B002RWKSII|5.0|Just picked this up at lunchtime and popped it into the CD player on the way back to work. After the first medley I found I was smiling and teary-eyed at the same time. This is one of Brian's best - it has a little bit of everything in terms of musical style. You can hear little references to Pet Sounds, Smile, and even California Girls. His singing really stands out in particular - almost jazzy this time around, and more soulful. His band is at its best. This was ever so carefully and lovingly put together - I will be living with it for the next few weeks.    So if you're wondering whether to buy this one, don't hesitate. I've been buying Brian Wilson records since I was in 7th grade. Sure, he's had a few clunkers, but this one is a GEM. Brian RULES!!!

B001OQCV6A|5.0|This is a wonderful movie,  we have watched it at least 10 times since getting it from Amazon.  Highly recommended.
0143118420|1.0|I read the first few pages and couldn't take it anymore.  What a superficial, silly, self absorbed, needy woman.  I am a single woman in my late '30's and if I ever find the right guy and get married, I am pretty sure that I would not expect him to fullfill my emotional needs.  What is with these wealthy women who seemingly have everything on the ourside but cannot find self fullfillment?!  It is disturbing to me that these same women, who after a few years of dating, become desperate and marry in their '20's to the first guy who comes along only to find that their marriage isn't was it is supposed to be?!  I feel like shaking these women and telling them that THEY are the ones who wanted to get married, THEY are the ones who wanted to have kids and THEY are the ones who are trying to find a \\"balance\\" in their lives.  If their needs aren't being met, then that is THEIR problem, not their husbands.  If Ms. Gilbert isn't being fulfilled at home or at her job (and who is by the way? - I don't think anyone is always fullfilled at home or at their work), why not join a gym, take a walk, go to a book store for some down time, volunteer, mix with people who are less fortunate than herself rather than get divorced, have an affair and then realize that she has to \\"find herself\\" in order to be happy?  The woman is so neurotic about being single - she claims she \\"doesn't want to be married anymore\\" but then jumps into an affair and when that (not surprisingly) doesn't work out, goes to Italy where she wants an Italian hunk to kiss her only to end up getting married again to some guy she met in Indonesia.  Where is the \\"self discovery\\" in that?  I doubt she really has learned anything from her publisher-paid \\"journey\\".  I wish these publishers would stop publishing these silly stories that make all women look stupid and indecisive.  Not to be mean or visicous, I think a more relatable \\"journey\\", especially in these tough economic times, would have been if Ms. Gilbert lost her job and had to struggle to make ends meet or some sort of life changing event that would have made her realize that she is not going to be a \\"cute\\" blond, wealthy woman forever.  I think most readers would have embraced that book.
B003JTHESA|4.0|Dear people,   I won´t be bothering you with ultra long specialized, technique, expert type of review.  As all of us know, Iron Maiden have been delivering albums for 30 years now. And I can say that they have ALWAYS delivered, maybe with the little exception of Virtual XI.  This is a complex album, lots of music, so it is quite hard to just conclude it is their best, their worst, or anything else, within the first day of release. The only thing I would recommend, is to give it some listens, and if you are a real Iron Maiden fan, you will realize that the spice is still there, a little different, a little the same... But Iron Maiden always deliver!!!!

B003JTHETY|4.0|Iron Maiden's The Final Frontier is out today. Honestly first listen I was underwhelmed. By about the third listen I began to love this album overall. There is much speculation that this could be their last album. Obviously the title could be a sign. These guys are pushing 50s and 60s I believe. Which leads me to a couple of observations on the new album.    The pace of their albums continues to slow down. Dance of Death was a true return to form from the 80s imo. I was a little disappointed with A Matter of Life and Death (which I grew to love) as the album did not carry on the blistering paced momentum that Maiden gained with Dance. In every respect I'd say Final Frontier continues the trend of slowing down. This is a more mellow, introspective, even spiritual Iron Maiden. The pace of the album is almost consistent through the entire album. For the most part slow melodic introductions building to mid-tempo, melodic choruses.    Is this bad? In my opinion not at all. Maiden is just different. Sold out? Not even close. Lyrically Final Frontier is fantastic. Again revisiting the theme of war as MoLaD did. There is a definite environmental theme running through this album, specifically on Isle of Avalon (one of my favorite tracks). Most of all, this album is somewhat 'We're all doomed' heavy. There is a sadness and almost surrender to what is coming, what we have brought upon ourselves in the songwriting. 'A Wild Wind in the Willows' closes the album and is to say the least not an uplifting song.    Is this album an end of a 30+ year career? I hope not. After a few listens the moments of brilliance start to come through. Lyrically and theme-wise this album is timely with all that's going on in the world. As a guitar player, there are some 'Wow' moments. Some 'jazz fusion what the hell is that doing on a Maiden album' moments that are really cool. I really like the metal 'Portal' deluxe packaging.    I have a feeling many won't like this album. It is different, but atit's core this is still a Maiden album through and through. Experimental Maiden is better than no Maiden at all.    Up THE IRONS!    Standouts for me:    Mother of Mercy  Isle of Avalon  The Talisman  The Man Who Would Be King  Where the Wild Wind Blows
6305907145|2.0|If you could have transported this cast to the 1983 screenplay (or just redone it with this cast) you would have had a film in the same league with A&E's Pride and Prejudice. The notable exception would have been for O'connor to have copied Sylvestra Le Touzel's shy and humble Fanny. And for Lindsay Duncan to have copied Angela Pleasence's sleepy Lady Bertram instead of the director's choice of making her a drug addict. And of course the last (and perhaps worst problem) is that instead of telling Jane's Mansfield, the writer Roszema turns it in her political soap box with the political correct condemnation of slavery and also finishing out turning Fanny into a Jane wannabe writer... Maybe her dream (and failure), but not Fanny's (or Jane's for that matter).
B003EYVXXW|4.0|Beautifully shot, with absolutely stunning visual sequences, terrific performances, and sets that are just breathtaking. The storyline, of which there are several from which scholars may choose, is one that in every possible instance condemns the Alexandrian Christians of the time. There's no settled agreement on exactly what was done and by whom in this historical episode -- although most modern scholars agree that Cyril was unfairly impugned by a later writer who not only wasn't there, but was unfriendly to Christianity generally and Cyril in particular. Indeed the events themselves may not have occurred, at least as we see them here. (A scene in which Cyril rehearses some of the weakest possible modern arguments against women priests, for example, is laughable.) But people believe what they need to believe. For those inclined against historical Christianity, the storyline will be reassuring. For those interested in knowing more about Cyril and his thoughtful contributions to theology, there is nothing to see in this film. But for those simply curious to see how 4th century Alexandria may have looked, Agora is a true blessing.

0446563048|1.0|This book has little content of value, but at least it's badly written.  The writing style is Junior High level at best. The author seems only interested in telling his own story, with an excruciating amount of needless detail to meaningless trivia.  If there are any useful lessons, I sure as heck couldn't find them. The \\"advice\\" sections were embarrassingly shallow and generic. I'm just happy the book was a gift: I would feel robbed if I had paid money for it.

1594488843|1.0|The main rationale of the book is something fully know by an average psychologist and by a good economist. I do not suggest that psychologists are smarter than economists but, in their field of knowledge, all of this could be commonsense while an economist could see these contents a little bit further from his domain.<br /><br />External motivators kill internal motivation. Agreed. That is a problem not only for the corporate world. It is too the real killer of the learning drive in any educational system. What else?<br /><br />Once established this principle, Pink devotes a good part of the book to illuminate it with supposedly atonishing examples of reactions opposed to folk psychology.<br /><br />The principle was good and not self-evident for many people. By the way, years ago another writer (Alfie Kohn) wrote \\"Punished by Rewards\\" where he commented exactly the same principle. The problem is that, to be valuable, the book needs to go one or two steps beyond. Instead of it, Pink remains in the field of examples and his practical solution is very far from being practical and from being a solution at all.<br /><br />Many of the \\"atonishing\\" examples used by Pink could be easily explained if we remember that there are three types of rewards: Moral, Social and Economic. The trick is that there is an interaction among them and this interaction could work in different ways.<br /><br />For instance, a low economic reward for blood donors removes the social reward (self-image as generous) and, surprisingly for Pink, decreases donations since people prefer keeping the self-image. Imagine, by the other side, a football or NBA player: Salary is not only a way to survive; it is a proof of social position and we could not say that, since salary is not the real motivation, we can decrease it. In this case, the example should work in an opposite way to the blood donors example. Does it look easy? It's because it is really easy.<br /><br />Why Pink does not explain something as easy as that, able to explain ALL the supposed contradictions in the book, instead of writing example after example without offering a general solution? Instead, Pink offers a \\"little principle\\" to explain every example instead of going to a general law. By the way, the best explanation I have found about the types of rewards and the consequences is in the book \\"Freakonomics\\", writen by an economist. This is the step beyond that this book should have done to be really valuable.contradictions in the book, instead of writing example after example without offering a general solution?

030726999X|5.0|One of the biggest mysteries in Stieg Larsson's \\"Millennium\\" trilogy (perhaps the only one which won't be revealed by the end of this doorstopper of a concluding part) is just what it is about the series that made it such a runaway success in the first place.<br /><br />There is, of course, the \\"unpublished manuscript of dead author\\" angle - call it the [[ASIN:0802130208 John Kennedy Toole]] factor - which guarantees no following swarm of copycats. All the same, the first 200 pages of the opening novel, [[ASIN:1847245455 The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo]] (a tattoo which, by the way, scarcely rates a mention in nearly 2000 following pages of text) is so leaden, slow and complicated that it is remarkable that this Zeppelin of a series ever gets off the ground.<br /><br />To be sure, it is difficult to see how else Larsson could have introduced such a complex and labyrinthine scenario. If, like I did, you thought Sweden was a well meaning, well-adjusted, fresh, healthy, happy and therefore fundamentally dull place (I can say this: I'm from New Zealand), then career crime journalist Larsson has a shock for you: Lisbeth Salander's Sweden is a dark, gothic, misogynistic, corrupt and morally bankrupt den of murder, rape and industrial espionage. And they drink lots of coffee. Yet it *still* comes across as a place you'd quite like to visit.<br /><br />And that, I think, is it. No-one's ever written a thriller about Sweden before. Almost no-one has even been there (but we've all heard stories of racey saunas, abundant shagging, lightless days, darkless nights and £20 pints of beer) and Larsson's major gift is populating and characterising this foreign country, while all the time writing in a way that - even in translation - is undeniably Swedish.<br /><br />That is to say, a little meandering, a bit right-on in its political agenda and quaintly parochial in the incidental details it records of the various goings on.<br /><br />Some of these details - such as a painstaking attention to street-level detail in the many characters' many excursions - and amusingly unpronounceable names they are, too - both lend the air of authenticity to proceedings and facilitate the business prospects of would-be tour guides.<br /><br />Others just add a sense of otherworldliness. The most notable is Larsson's utter fixation with coffee. The entire ambition and reach of the plot can be charted round the caffeine consumption of his characters. On almost every page (of 2000 odd) coffee is brewed, poured or consumed: it is drunk for breakfast, at lunch and at dinner. At morning and afternoon tea. Before love-making and afterward. In espresso, cappuccino, latte, filter and by drip. In thermos and in cafeti&egrave;re. It is ordered, requested and declined. Characters argue about whose turn it is to pour. They refill their flasks of coffee, they wash out their thermoses after drinking coffee. They leave them in the sink or on the sideboard. There is an extraordinary level of detail about coffee, to the point where, if it weren't presented so poker-faced, you'd surmise it was some sort of running joke. It's very Swedish, in any case.<br /><br />Larsson's plotting is undeniably impressive and becomes more ambitious as the series develops, to the point where, in the last instalment, the scope of the conspiracy is almost [[ASIN:0099537826 Ellroy]]esque:  by the end there are at least four different factions spying on each other for various purposes and thirty or more meaningful characters, most with long, complicated and strikingly similar names - to hold in contemplation.<br /><br />While Larsson's prose is nothing like as economical or stylish as James Ellroy's - way too much coffee for that - The Girl Who Kicked The Hornet's Nest gallops along in a way that few 750 page books I can think of do, and therefore this, and the Millennium series in general, come as a well recommended read which justifies the runaway publishing phenomenon that so puzzled me at the outset of this review.<br /><br />I suppose I've answered my own question, therefore.<br /><br />Olly Buxtontherefore.

0399156577|2.0|I read all Nora Robert's books, and this one was fine, but not particularly great.  I didn't love the extensive dog training stuff (really, I feel like I could go out and get a dog  and use Nora's book as my training manual).  I wasn't that impressed with the bad guy/serial killer returns plot, but it was ok.  There were some funny moments, but not enough to warrant buying a hard copy book.  I found myself skimming through big chunks of the book (mostly dog related stuff) to get  back to the story between Fiona and Simon.
0061876747|3.0|3.5 stars really. I liked Adam Kindred, but I could never believe the two major events underlying the story (I won't spoil by explaining). Nevertheless, the subtle humor and great gallery of people makes this more than worth it. The end might annoy some readers, to me it felt 'right'.
B003JTHESA|4.0|Maiden worked on this CD for basically four years, so any reviewer who listens to it a couple of times before they beat it down isn't doing it or themselves any justice. It took me many listens to really get into AMOLAD and now I consider it one of their better albums (not one weak song in the bunch).<br />Now I know everybody always says that they've been Maiden fans since day one and that makes them some kind of expert on the band. Not quite for me, but how about since I first heard Killers back in 81. They lost me for a little while with No Prayer and the Blaze CD's but since then their music and penmanship have been fantastic. Is Maiden the same band as they were back then...of course not, who is? They have changed and matured musically. This is not your typical metal, you know...verse, chorus, verse, chorus, solo, chorus, fade out. The lyrics on this CD are fantastic and deserve a good reading, especially if you do some research on the subject matter.<br />Just give this CD a fair shot and you will enjoy it, definitely worth the purchase.
1849162743|5.0|Brilliant conclusion to the series.  I haven't been this engaged in fiction since Stephen King's books of the 80's.  I struggled through Dragon Tattoo.  Thankfully, the film cut out uninteresting details.  This is a rare case when I thought the film was better than the book.  I didn't bother reading Played with Fire and saw the movie instead.  I had to know what happened next, so I dove into Hornet's Nest.  I cannot recall the last time I read a 700+ page paperback.  Totally worthwhile.  Lisbeth is my hero.
B003QNXPUK|1.0|Applied exactly as instructed and was able to apply securely with no bubbles.  Looked great and let set for overnight for 12 hours; did not touch the shield while setting.  Two days later the film i pulled the phone out of my pocket (it was the only thing in that pocket) and the film on the back was half peeled off with pocket lint under it.  Could not salvage to reapply.  The shield does not stick as advertised and I would not recommend this to anyone.
B003JTHESA|4.0|I don't agree with the previous reviewer saying that Maiden is \\"solid as ever\\", or \\"has never left\\". Let's face it, while the first 10 years of their career are legendary, the quality of the Iron Maiden albums over the past 20 years has been pretty uneven, with some individual gems hidden between many drab, uninspired attempts at being 'epic' and/or 'up-to-date'.  And after seeing the ugly sleeve design and hearing the dreary 5 minute intro to the album, I feared very much that The Final Frontier would be more of the same. But then it improves. And then gets quite good.<br />In fact, this is the first album in years where the good songs dominate the poor ones. The classic galopping sound is back in full force and there are plenty of great melodies and song structures. 'Coming Home', 'The Alchemist' and 'Starblind' are instantly likeable, and none of these songs would be out of place on an album like, let's say, Powerslave. 'The Talisman' is also quite ok. Yes it is long, but it sounds more like a song (think 'The Longest Day') and less like a boring cut 'n paste track (think 'Brighter than a Thousand Suns'). 'Mother of Mercy' and the title track are mostly fine but suffer from a poor chorus. Only the cheesy folk or pop tune that opens and closes \\"Where the Wild Wind Blows\\" really ehr.. blows. I read somewhere that the melody is a rip-off from 'Make it Real' by the Scorpions, but that song is way better. In short, finally there is a Maiden album again that one might consider buying in its entirety, instead of cherrypicking a few songs. Up the Irons!
B002F6FQGK|5.0|It's very sad to say that I honestly don't remember the last time I've actually loved an album from beginning to end! Does that say more about me or the actual lackluster state of music today? I'm gonna say...not me. Within 2 days I knew every song word-4-word. This album is addictive! Speaking of...DEFINITELY check out her version of \\"Addicted to love\\" (AMAZING). Now, while I love every song, I really really do, there are of course a few that taste just a little sweeter than the others:    Dog Days Are Over: Play this on a Sunday morning, full blast. Church is no longer needed.    Howl: Beautiful. Honest. You have to HOWL.    Girl With One Eye: I don't know who this girl is, but I am dam glad I'm not her.     Drumming Song: \\"I swear that you should hear it, it makes such an almighty sound.\\"     Between Two Lungs: Sweet, in an organ focused kinda way. :)    Cosmic Love: Breathtaking! This is my wedding song. A beautiful tale of consuming love, I got it.     Blinding: Where was this song when I was 17!!     This album is worth every cent! It's one of those that are hard to define and explain. You just have to hear it for yourself. You won't regret it.
B001NXDSLQ|5.0|I'm sure many of you would like to see some of the extra footage on the box set and I am one of them. But in the meantime, this will do. I recommend this one to the people who can't afford to just go and buy one of those ultra-rare \\"got-it-all\\" type boxes on a whim! This was a Christmas present from one of my favorite co-workers and much appreciated at that. Ok, enough of the personal chatter and on with the review.    It all begins with the Warner Bros. logo aflame to the feedback of Jimi Hendrix (whose performance we'll save for the end) and a cheerful tavern owner nearby the grounds who just witnessed some of the fans who helped bolster his business for the weekend. You get to see the setting up of the festival (no small task). Richie Havens was the 1st live performer (his set was 3 hours long but only \\"Handsome Johnny\\" and \\"Freedom\\" survived the film), though his songs aren't the 1st you'll hear in the movie. Extra footage includes Janis Joplin, Canned Heat and Jefferson Airplane (I always thought until this footage was released Grace's \\"Morning, people!\\" was from \\"Volunteers\\"). Joan Baez sings \\"Joe Hill\\" and \\"Swing Low Sweet Chariot.\\" Footage includes a rainstorm and a mudbath to follow (careful- you may catch yourself joining in on the \\"Whoa-oh-oh, whoa-oh!\\" chorus), Chip Monck's announcement that it's a free concert (after a few freeloaders break the fence), yoga, a few disgruntled neighbors, breakfast in bed (with gravelly voice Wavy Gravy doing the announcement), taking a bath in the lake, kids calling their parents and of course, the benediction of Max Yasgur who generously loaned his farm out. The Who perform Tommy (yet all we see and hear is \\"See Me Feel Me,\\" \\"Summertime Blues\\" and Pete's guitar destruction finale, Joe Cocker passionately sings (and screams) \\"With A Little Help From My Friends.\\" Ten Years After sings \\"I'm Going Home\\" (it's fun to watch the bass player exhort the audience to clap their hands and the drummer looks amused, not to mention Alvin Lee's untimely gathering of the gifted watermelon). One of Santana's 1st performances ever is stellar (Carlos looks very young), Country Joe McDonald sings the acoustic \\"Fixin' To Die\\" (complete with the bouncing ball for singalong purposes) and the electric (with his band the Fish) \\"Rock And Soul Music\\" (this song was supposedly written for the festival) and Arlo Guthrie sings \\"Comin' Into Los Angeles.\\" John Sebastian forgets the words to \\"Younger Generation\\" (he wasn't exactly a happy camper at this time), Sly and the Family Stone perform an amazing rendition of \\"Let Me Take You Higher\\" and \\"Music Lover\\" (Sly exhorts the audience to sing \\"Higher\\" and hold up the quintessential peace sign). Sha Na Na (the 2nd to last performers) play one of the 1st ever gigs (many have said this wasn't their favorite, but like it or not, it probably helped them get their own TV show a few years later), Crosby, Stills, Nash and Young perform the 2nd time ever live. And of course, Jimi Hendrix wraps up the concert with \\"Voodoo Chile,\\" \\"The Star Spangled Banner,\\" \\"Purple Haze\\" and \\"Villanova Junction.\\"     If you haven't seen this movie ever, see this version (I must add, you can hear a piano during \\"I'm Going Home\\" in the mix). Peace out!
030726999X|5.0|I couldn't wait to start reading Hornet's nest and I was not disappointed.  I truly could not put this book down.  This trilogy had me hooked from the very beginning.  Excellent twists and turns and the ending was very satisfying.  I only wish the author was still around to continue writing more stories.  He was truly gifted.
1400052173|4.0|I went to a book reading/signing and really enjoyed what the author had to say, so I bought the book.  It was a little academic for me, but once I go into it, I really found the story fascinating.  I heard Oprah & HBO were going to make it into a miniseries.  I hope so- it's a story that needs to be told!
B00003CXB4|5.0|Love the movie, my little girl had lost the first one we got for her, so getting this ASAP was remarkable.
B0013TPV0Q|3.0|The writing was funny.  The essays were light and well written.  It was a very enjoyable read, my first from David Sedaris.<br /><br />So why only three stars?  Essayists publishing their works in books in this day of blogs is a little outdated.  I know a few bloggers who write just as well, with just as much humor and interest, and I read them for free and moments after they post them.  I'm not disparaging Mr. Sedaris in saying this, but I wish I would have spent my money on an experience I couldn't have gotten online for free.
B003N5VOUO|5.0|This movie is very different from SRK's past films. There are no big dance numbers and the issue at hand is more than just a love triangle. This movie has a depth that I have not come to expect in commercial hindi films and to those few that are not intent on purchasing this for the sole reason of the onscreen SRK and Kajol chemistry, you should purchase it for the laughs and the moments that will choke you up. This movie is exceptional and I am more than proud to add it to my arsenal of filmi DVDs, and everyone should see this movie at least once so you can widen your perspective.
B0039UTDA6|4.0|I don't have an axe to grind over the narration - all I can say is my 5 year old son loves this series and repeats phrases that he hears the narrator say. He asks to watch it again and again. The narration is written to draw the viewer into the drama of what they are seeing, and though they are sometimes \\"dumbed down\\" or made into cutesey allegories with small words even children can understand, this actually works quite well for young children. The few times I have sat down with him, it's been entertaining viewing for me too. Though I can understand that serious naturalists should perhaps look elsewhere, the visuals are stunning and overall make for a good way to introduce my kids to the wonders of the natural world. My son watches this before bedtime for 30 minutes and he always has a lot to say about what he saw.

0061998494|5.0|I am a big fan of the Late Late Show with Craig Ferguson, so I had been trying to find both his books (the other one is \\"Between the Bridge and the River\\") for quite a while at my local library. Finally I just bought them on Amazon.     I started reading the other book, which is a novel, first, and didn't know what to expect with this one, because the other one was a bit dark and had a lot of graphic scenes. So, here goes:     American on Purpose is Craig's autobiography, and it is on a par with his public persona, to a large degree. Ferguson touches on his childhood in Scotland, his adolescence & early adulthood in the UK and America, all three of his marriages, and his alcoholism. He explores the causes, roots, effects, etc. of his alcoholism and how it affected his life and relationships, while doing a bit of name dropping and eventually getting to the part of his life where he moved to America and lived happily ever after. Well, so far, at least.     If you are a fan of Craig's, this is a fascinating and entertaining book.     If you are not a fan of Craig's, this is a fascinating and entertaining book.     Actually, the second statement might not be true, but you'd have to read the book to find out.     Anyhow, I enjoyed it, it was a good read in spite of all the name dropping and kilts. :-)
0688014291|4.0|First published in the early 1980s, this thin book is a classic of the business world. The book is a business parable of sorts, a fictional tale of a young man who wants to learn everything he can about how to be an effective manager.<br /><br />In the course of his travels, he hears of a manager of a company in a nearby town who has the reputation of being both effective and admired. The young man arranges a meeting with this manager and is surprised to hear him describe himself as a \\"one minute manager\\". Rather than explain himself immediately, the manager encourages the young man to talk with other employees and learn about the techniques that he uses.<br /><br />Essentially, this book covers three areas on interpersonal and organizational skills: Goal setting, praising, and reprimanding. It is not so much a book about the mechanical tasks of managing, but rather a set of lessons in interpersonal relationships and the psychology of job performance.<br /><br />Starting with the premise that employees who feel valued will be more productive, the book describes simple techniques to encourage productive behavior and to correct deficiencies.<br /><br />Although the central theme of the book constitutes program of management style, there is plenty here that a prospective manager could come away with, even if they did not choose to embrace the entire One Minute Manager program.<br /><br />Even if you never plan to become a \\"one minute manager\\", this is a good book on interpersonal relations in the workplace and beyond.
B002ZG983M|4.0|at first i didn't want to watch this because i thought it would be cheesy...but it wasn't.  it was actually pretty good due to the fact that it wasn't a typical superhero movie.  the colors, graphics, costumes, characters and the comic like way is fantastic.<br /><br />i def. recommend this movie to all..maybe not so much kids because it can be a little bloody.
1423113381|5.0|My 9 year old son was thrilled when he got an Amazon gift card. The first thing on his list was this new book from Rick Riordan.  He is enjoying the book and all the action in the story.  He is already talking about getting the second book in the series.  For a boy who is full of activity himself this book is a big hit.
B001DJLCRC|5.0|I did not start watching AMC's \\"Breaking Bad\\" until after the second season had already aired. Having played catch-up and seen Seasons 1-3 in their entirety, I do not hesitate when I tell people that this is simply the best show on television right now, bar none.     But most people spend these reviews talking about how great the series is, so I'll skip the warm-and-fuzzies and talk directly about the Season 1 DVD set that you are probably trying to decide whether to buy or not. Here's my recommendation: Buy it.    First off, the box and cases. The box art is terrific, with the iconic Walt-White-in-tightie-whities stuck right onto the front. The box (which doesn't take up more than 3/4 an inch of shelf space, if even that) contains two plastic disc cases -- the first holds Episodes 1-6, and the second holds Episode 7 along with the Bonus Features. While I would avoid getting the box (which is something in between paper and cardboard) wet, the plastic cases hold up pretty well... I've dropped them several times and they've never so much as cracked on me.    The picture quality is terrific. AMC is known for shooting their scripted television almost cinematically, so if you're a full-screen fanatic, get the heck out of here because widescreen is the only way to watch these. Blu-Ray babies: Sorry, the colors don't necessarily pop, but this isn't the kind of show that necessarily would benefit from that anyway.    And finally, the bonus features. Audio commentaries are attached to both the pilot episode and Episode 6 (\\"Crazy Handful of Nothin'\\"), and feature showrunner Vince Gilligan, along with cast and occasionally crew. Most of the time, it can be pretty entertaining. The second disc has a Making Of feature for those of you who like that sort of thing; the real meat of the behind-the-scenes, though, comes from their 'Inside Breaking Bad' video compilation, in which each video is dedicated to a different aspect of the show (one video deals with Bryan Cranston shaving his head for the role, while another deals with the aforementioned tightie-whities). Also on the disc is a photo gallery and a segment of AMC's interview program called \\"Shootout,\\" when Cranston, Gilligan, and producer Mark Johnson appeared to promote the show. And last but certainly not least, the Bonus Features include screen tests of actors Aaron Paul, Anna Gunn, Betsy Brandt, and Dean Norris; really cool stuff if, again, you are into that sort of thing.    Overall, a terrific box set for the show's first season, cut short by the writers' strike a few years ago. Season 2's boxset is even better, and I recommend that as soon as you buy this set, you hop on over and buy that one as well.     I hope this review was informative, and I hope you enjoy the show as much as I did.    The picture
B003L20IDS|3.0|As a 46 year old male, I know that I am not the target audience for SCOTT PILGRIM VS. THE WORLD.  But I am a voracious consumer of movies and feel that my tastes are pretty eclectic and that I'm open to just about anything (cinematically speaking).  I'm also a fan of Michael Cera, even though I've said before that I'm a little tired of him presenting the same character over and over.      So, with all that said, I am sorry to conclude that despite the seemingly universal love of this film, I am NOT a fan of SCOTT PILGRIM.  There are many elements that are actually quite enjoyable, but at the heart of the story (which is supposed to be an epic romance) there is no heart.    Scott Pilgrim is a bit of a loser.  He plays bass in a band that hopes to do well in a local Battle of the Bands...but also apparently hasn't ever really had a gig before.  He's in his 20s but dating a 17 year-old high school girl.  He rooms with Wallace (Keiran Culkin) in a true hovel of an apartment..and is about to be evicted.  And he's played by Michael Cera, the master of the smart but super insecure and lovelorn loser.      One night at a party, Pilgrim spies Ramona Flowers (Mary Elizabeth Winstead) from across the room.  She's got brightly colored hair, wears lots of layers of black clothing and is clearly out of Scott's league.  But he tricks her into a first date, and there are sparks and a relationship ensues.  But Ramona is a girl with baggage.  Baggage that can literally come back to bite Scott.      Ramona has seven ex-lovers (going all the way back to eighth grade), and it turns out that Scott must wage more-or-less mortal combat with each of these super-heroic exes.  This is all presented in the manner of a video game, with points being racked up and Scott and his opponents executing Mortal Combat -type moves.  This structure is the primary conceit of the film...and for me, it only worked sporadically.  The fight scenes have a sameness about them.  The cleverness with which they areexecuted diffuses any opportunity for tension or drama...and we never for one second doubt that Scott will triumph.      But I'd have mostly overlooked this if I had cared one bit about the relationship between Scott and Ramona.  First of all, he's already dating the 17-year-old Knives Chau (Ellen Wong)...and she's a delightful girl, so the whole time, we're left feeling bad for her rather than good for Scott.  But more than this, Michael Cera has become a virtual caricature of his persona.  He first introduced himself to the world in the excellent, dare I say classic, ARRESTED DEVELOPMENT.  Then he rose to general stardom with his refreshing work in SUPERBAD.  And then each subsequent performance was essentially a riff on the exact same character, and each time, the power of that character to amuse was diminished.  Now Cera, with his doughy face and lack of a chin, is utterly and completely unbelievable as a person who could make sparks fly across a crowded room.  When Ramona has a deeper voice than her boyfriend, it's also very hard to take him seriously when he's crushing opponents played by the likes of Chris Evans (FANTASTIC FOUR).       The film has a cast full of charming young ladies.  Alison Pil, Anna Kendrick, Ellen Wong, etc.  In fact, Pil (who plays the drummer in Scott's band) is the most dynamic performer in the film.  Her freckled face, short red hair and unflinching ferocity are compelling, and I wanted to see more of her and less of folks like Culkin, who is seems to be the \\"token gay friend\\" of Pilgrim.  He's wan and pale and hedonistic in a low key way.  Even the usually fun Jason Schwartzman (as the ultimate ex boyfriend) is phoning in his work, as though he doesn't quite understand what it's all about.  He's also the closest thing to an adult in the film.  I might be remembering this incorrectly, but I don't think there are any adults in the film at all...it's a world populated entirely by teens and twenty-somethings.  That's perfectly fine, but it adds another layer of removal from reality that the film really doesn't need.  It's as though the creators don't want us to actually care about anyone in the film, but would rather we were simply enamored of the visual style and off-beat story.    I know this is based on a graphic novel, but while setting the film in snow-swept Toronto makes for some nice comic book visuals...it adds yet another layer of chill on any emotion the film might generate.      I laughed a decent amount, and I wouldn't say that I actively hated SCOTT PILGRIM VS. THE WORLD...but for a film that expended so much energy and was so clearly in love with itself, I found it to be a deep disappointment.  I imagine it will enjoy a long life with a small but very devoted group of fans...and most of its viewers will forget it very soon after seeing it.
B003JTHESA|5.0|When I listened to the pre-releases of El Dorado and the FF video, I was a bit worried. Now that the full album is out, no more worries: this is a solid album that will generate repetead enjoyment with every new listen. Even the said two songs sound much better in the context of the whole album, which is why it's important to play it in its entirety and not just once.
0688014291|5.0|The time management techniques outlined in this book have become part of my daily routine for many years.  They have bought me hundreds of extra work hours, solidified information and increased my effectiveness as a manager and as an individual.

0061537969|5.0|I really loved this book, and have since recommended it to so many friends and family.  A brilliant story from a dog's perspective.

B003QCCS36|5.0|\\"God willin' & the creek don't rise\\" is Ray Lamontagne's fourth album. It continues in the Folky Alt Country vein of its predecessor \\"Gossip in the grain\\" but largely without the psychedelic flourishes of that album but this time with a few friends comprising The Pariah Dogs.<br /><br />The album comprises 10 tracks and opens with the retro Funk \\"Repo man\\" which wouldn't sound out of place on a James Brown album. The Country ballad \\"New York City's killing me\\" is wistful while the title track cranks up the melancholic factor even more.<br /><br />Other standouts are the acoustic \\"Are we really through\\", the denser \\"For the summer\\", the more rocking Blues of \\"The devil's in the jukebox\\", and my favourite, the tremulous heartfelt acoustic \\"This love is over\\" perfectly showcasing his grainy croon as he sings in a vulnerable whisper.  Truly spectacular!
0312370849|5.0|I really liked this story.  I cannot attest to the facts, but the story itself was captivating and depressing, all at the same time.  A really good read.
B001AQTWF2|5.0|I've just finish having my personal 'Whitney Houston Festival' and challenge anyone to sit down and listen to Whitney's \\"I look to You\\" and compare vocals from \\"Just Whitney\\" album and tell me if there's any difference at all.    There's absolutely no difference in her vocal power, her vocal gymnastics. Although I love Whitney's ballards, her peppy \\"So Emotional\\", \\"I just want to Dance with Somebody\\", let's face it; Whitney Houston has grown up. WE ALL HAVE GROWN UP.     Some people STILL only want to see Whitney in a long glamorous evening dress,the fan blowing & a full choir in the background.       But, since I have GROWN UP with Whitney, I want music that speaks to me right now. As a female, her songs are like a little chart of what a lot of us have gone thru. But now, it's grown up love. Grown Up Love as in \\"I'll Call You Tonight\\".      For those of you still loving to hear \\"You Give Good Love\\", then simply listen to \\"Worth It\\" & tell me if you think she has lost her vocal 'innocence', I think not!     For those of you still want that seamless vocal command of octave change like in 'I have Nothing\\"; then listen at the end of \\"A Song for You\\".     And for those of you who still want a \\"Dance with Somebody\\" song, don't worry. \\"For the Lovers\\" should soothe your soul and alleve all fears. Whitney's back and she so good it is like she's \\"Never Been Gone Before\\" !
0307454541|4.0|I thought this was a great read.  I am a very fast reader, and always seem to get through books twice as fast as most of my friends.  For that reason alone I really liked this book, as the characters and story are very complex.  I continually had to keep checking the character list, in order to see who was who.  I really liked that about the book, and enjoyed how complex the story was.  You could tell this story took a lot of thought and planning. I read the 2nd one in the series already and am waiting for the 3rd to come out in paperback so that I can buy it!

B002EWD0I6|5.0|I loved this series of shows.  My whole family got into them and we've watched them over and over.  What I like the most is what they teach, good values and morals, and they are funny, witty, sad, and real.
0757302661|4.0|I took a class at the hospital on hypnobirthing, using this book, with my first son.  Using the CD's and reading the book, was really helpful for me in pregnancy.  I felt much more connected with my child, the relaxation tapes were great (and put me right to sleep), and I felt like I gained confidence and skills for a non-medicated labor.  I liked the emphasis in the book on learning to trust my intuition for labor, and releasing the fear associated with childbirth.  However, were it not for the class which gave additional tips and techniques to use during labor, I think I would have been a bit lost in the labor itself.  As for labor itself, I had a quick labor, especially for a first baby.   I had back labor, so it was not pain free,as described.  However, I felt able to relax between contractions and continued to feel deeply connected to my baby during the labor.  Hypnobirthing was not as I expected exactly, but I did feel it was really positive, continuing into postpartum. After my son was born, I continued to listen to the relaxation tapes, when I was trying to sleep at off times, and needed extra help falling asleep.  I also appreciated all the prep work on trusting my intuition and the deep connection I believe hypnobirthing helped me develop with my son.  I am pregnant with my second, and will be trying a more comprehensive Hypnobirthing course (which is also MUCH more expensive).  If you are considering this, I would encourage you to take a class in addition to the book, or work with a Doula or Midwife who will support you integrating the techniques into your birth.
0671646788|3.0|This was a decent book, I bought it because it was recommended in the 4 Hour Work Week. It's pretty dated, and it gets a bit tedious. It would be worth skimming though, it does have some decent ideas.

B002RWKSII|3.0|The upper tier of the Great American Songbook acquaints itself with island breezes, doo-wop arrangements and SoCal-friendly harmonies as one of America's foremost singer/songwriters pays tribute to one of his idols on \\"Brian Wilson Reimagines Gershwin.\\"<br /><br />Both Wilson and George Gershwin are titans among contributors to American pop culture, making this album noteworthy and significant by mere fact of its having been made. Luckily for listeners it goes beyond predictability. Staying true to the title, Wilson sings and arranges the selections in almost exclusively unorthodox fashion.<br /><br />It is better to see an artist try something new and fail than hit all the \\"right\\" notes with no texture or originality. This makes the unremarkable moments largely forgivable.<br /><br />Wilson is in fine, fluid, large voice throughout. He sounds infinitely inspired on \\"I Loves You Porgy\\", and with a full orchestra to back him the results are sublime. He adds Beach Boys pep to \\"I Got Rhythm\\" as well as \\"They Can't Take That Away From Me,\\" gifting the album with an earnest, playful atmosphere. \\"Love Is Here to Stay\\" and \\"Someone to Watch Over Me\\" are gorgeously executed as well - it is hard to miss with a great singer and a great song.<br /><br />Other selections lag. \\"It Ain't Necessarily So\\" is too heavy, with the orchestra overblown and more upfront in the mix than Wilson's vocal, which is overloud in its own right. He may still have the chops at 68 to project loudly and forcefully, but it is not always necessary to do so. \\"S' Wonderful,\\" one of Gershwin's most languid, adorable songs, suffers likewise, lapsing into a wash of sound, saved only by an affecting flute solo.<br /><br />The most notable recordings are \\"The Like In I Love You\\" and \\"Nothing But Love,\\" songs that went uncompleted until Wilson finished them. The former is a slice of good old American pop with lush production, durable melody and sweet-as-candy vocals, while the latter glides by on an interesting blend of horns and guitars.<br /><br />At under 40 minutes, it should be noted, the album seem pretty skimpy for the digital era.<br /><br />The overblown production throughout is unfortunate since it is the kind of trickery used to disguise a thinning or non-existent voice, but Wilson's is in fine form, so the results are very loud and often at odds. Still, the album underscores Gershwin's timelessness while still remaining experimental and very much a Brian Wilson record - a fine accomplishment.er 40 minutes, it should be noted, the album seem pretty skimpy for the digital era.

0307454541|5.0|This was an easy and smooth process. I got the book fast.<br />The book overall is GREAT. I'm not 100% done with it yet. I took me a few chapters to get into it but i pushed through and i'm glad it did.
B003JTHESA|5.0|We have waited 4 years for this album to come out and it was worth the wait! This is a fantastic album filled with great songs and unexpected time changes. I have to admit that the first time I heard it, I honestly didn't like it. Had no idea what to think of it so I just played it again and it didn't seem as bad as before. So I played it again and again and it just gets better every time you listen to it. Half of the album has slow intros   but they're great! They have decided to not do outros which makes the songs even better! That was my only complaint about A Matter Of Life And Death, the outros, and now that's fixed. Another improvement is that the choruses are no longer repetitive! This album isn't their best but it's one hell of an album! All you have to do is give it some time to sink in.
0385504225|1.0|For those of you planning to read THE LOST SYMBOL, you may proceed. Yet, I must warn you that there's nothing special about it at all. I must say it's quite disappointing. Even THE DA VINCI CODE and ANGELS ANDS DEMONS are far better read than this \\"wild-goose chase\\" of a novel. I mean I was eagerly waiting for this book to be released just so I could see it to be as intriguing as TDVC if not as exciting as A&D. But it was not.<br /><br />It's as if the book is not just dull and disappointing but Brown had to \\"add insult to the injury\\" by implicating the concept of God in the last few chapters of the book. I'm not the kind who's easily offended nor was I affected by any of his previous works in \\"TDVC\\" and \\"A&D\\" where he involved paradigm shifts in religious matters (for I knew the arguments were nothing more but fictitious creations). Yet, for THE LOST SYMBOL, Brown had stepped over the threshold.<br /><br />On the whole, the book felt like a B-movie thriller (if it even qualifies as a thriller at all) where everything seemed rushed. It's as if he's rushing for a publishing dateline that he had to come up with lame conspiracies to supersede his previous Langdon's series.<br /><br />* * SPOILERS * *<br />Indeed, the Masonic Pyramid described in the novel was indeed a literal map but it's all there in the first place - The Washington Monument. And the winding staircase that leads to the Ancient Mysteries is actually within the obelisk itself. Geez! Talk about a lame story. And yeah, I do agree with National Post's review on the Mal'akh character in that he did remind me so much of Francis Dollarhyde from Thomas Harris' THE RED DRAGON.<br /><br />Like I said, Dan Brown only set off a wild-goose chase with this work of his. So if you think about reading this one, don't bother.

B001TH8UUA|5.0|I purchased a 15ft Mediabridge cable along with this 9.8ft Amazon cable (Amazon branded, outsourced in China, no doubt, as are all HDMI cables). One for my PS3/BD player and one for my Xbox 360. Both are cheap and both work perfectly. The Amazon cable's coating feels slightly flimsier than that of the Mediabridge cable but otherwise works just the same.    When it comes to digital signals, you will either get:  1. A perfect picture and audio, or  2. Bad picture and audio.    In other words, there is no \\"improving levels of quality\\" between the two states above. We are brought up with the idea that increasing levels of quality are possible by purchasing better cables. This may hold true for analog devices but, in the digital age, all video and analog signals are rendered into 1s and 0s. A picture, for example, is rendered as a continuous stream of 010101100010 (think Morse code); your HDTV picks them up and assigns appropriate colors to appropriate pixels accordingly. Everything is in cold hard science; no art is involved. Your cable will either be capable of transmitting the signals, or it will fail. There is good and there is bad, there is no \\"poor\\".    There is no reason to pay ridiculous amount for a HDMI cable. I would recommend paying a couple of dollars for brandless cables except that with them you do run a risk of getting a faulty cable. Amazon offers an exchange policy for people who want some sense of security. On second though, you might as well purchase half a dozen brandless HDMI cable: you end up paying less if only *one* of them works than if you have purchased one of those \\"monsters\\".

B003L20IDS|5.0|I really enjoyed this movie. It's been a while since I have enjoyed a movies in theaters this much.<br /><br />Scott Pilgrim is your average 20-something lay about. He lives with his roommate Wallace in Toronto and is dating a chinese high school girl named Knives Chow (whom he is dating because a painful breakup he had a year ago). So all is normal in Scott's life until he starts having these weird dreams about a girl with short hair, which isn't so distressing as we're all prone to dreams. But when he sees this girl in the library and discovers that she's real, he begins obsessing over her and can't stop thinking about her. He sees her again at a party and discovers that she works as a delivery girl for amazon, so goes home to order a package. When she delivers it he asks her if she would consider going out on a date with him, and she concedes. When he gets home he receives a mysterious letter that he disregards. Scott is in a band and they are entered in a battle of the bands. When they go up to play their set, the band is interrupted by an attack from a guy who wants to fight Scott. He informs Scott that if he wants to date Ramona Flowers, the mysterious girl, he will first have to defeat her 7 evil exes, of which he is the first.<br /><br />The movie was presented like it was a video game. There were video game sound effects, special effects that mimicked video game special effects, after he would defeat the exes they would explode into money (when you play a video game you can sometimes loot a boss for money) and at the end of the movie they copied an arcade game they played earlier in the film. Making this movie hugely relatable and enjoyable to anyone who plays video/ computer/ electronic games.<br /><br />I initially thought Michael Cera was to wimpy to play Scott, as he was way more hyper-active and hilariously spastic in the comic, but he did a pretty good job. There were a lot of small details that you'd have to re-watch the movie to catch (I've only seen it once so I'm sure there are lots that I've missed) but for example when he walks into the club for the final battle there are two people talking about the comic book and the movie. I sense a cult classic.ere are lots that I've missed) but for example when he walks into the club for the final battle there are two people talking about the comic book and the movie.

1439153663|5.0|Once I finish a book, I know immediately whether or not my review is going to be up to snuff. Usually, if I dislike a book, then I have no worries because I love writing a review about a book I hated. However, it is much more difficult to write a review about a book you loved, especially if you tend to skip summarizing the book as I do. So, when I finished The Kitchen House, I already knew, \\"Yeah, this review is going to be difficult to write and it may suck\\". So, I'm just forewarning everyone about what may happen.<br /><br />I absolutely loved and adored The Kitchen House. From page one I was enraptured with Lavinia's and Belle's similar, yet at the same time, distinct worlds. Usually, when a book has two narrators, I get this extreme sense of frustration because right when I'm getting into one narrators' story, it automatically shifts to the next narrator and I get mental whiplash. The Kitchen House didn't have this problem at all. The transition between the chapters was done in such a smooth way that had it just been Lavinia narrating the whole book, it wouldn't have made as much of an impact as it did. The descriptions in this book were also mesmerizing. I felt like I was right there in that plantation with Lavinia, Belle, Mama, Papa, etc. It was just so rich in writing that it was such a pleasure to read.<br /><br />So, I absolutely adored The Kitchen House. It was an amazing, captivating, tear-jerking (I was sobbing through the last twenty or so pages; literally sobbing) read. It was so great that I really can't eloquently express my thoughts on it because this is just one of those books you just HAVE TO READ in order to understand why I loved it so. Any words I write will just seem crappy in comparison. But really, read this absolutely great, amazing, novel.
B002RWKSII|5.0|I would have to say this album is Brian Wilson's Nice 'n' Easy.  It feels uncannily smooth and cool, like a perfect summer evening - and for all my wondering whether the blending of Wilson's California style of sunshine pop and Gershwin's Tin Pan Alley east coast sensibilities would prove an uneasy marriage melted away.  It's been well documented that Brian has been a long time fan of Gershwin's \\"Rhapsody In Blue\\" and how he wanted one day to do a vocal-only version of the concert staple, and here, bucket-list-like, Brian bows into the album with the fulfillment of that wish.  Brian's love of these melodies, and hit suitability to them is a happy shock - although it shouldn't be - Gershwin-style songs fill Brian's oeuvre, although you'd have to be familiar with their respective canons to realize it: the soaring melodicism and melancholy of \\"Summertime\\" is echoed in the wistfulness of \\"Caroline, No\\"; the cheeky socio-double-entendres present in \\"I Got Plenty O' Nuttin'\\" is taken to its modern-day extreme in Brian's \\"Busy Doin' Nothin'\\"; and the resilient note found in \\"They Can't Take That Away From Me\\" can be found in \\"I Just Wasn't Made For These Times.\\"  But this album succeeds in more than sympathetic compatablility - Brian sounds completely immersed in these songs - he's never sounded this invested in his singing - not even in his earliest recordings - he interprets these songs in what sounds like deeply personal ways, alternately sly, wistful, and smiling - from the silky Bacharach-flavored bossa-nova found on \\"S' Wonderful\\" to the call-and-response party of \\"They Can't Take That Away From Me\\" to the Beach Boys bass-line groove found on \\"I Got Rhythm\\" - this album is absolutely wall-to-wall fantastic. As for the two Wilson/Gershin \\"collaborations\\" - \\"The Like In I Love You\\" and \\"Nothing But Love\\" - although they're not on par with the classic songs that surround them, they're wonderfully realized, and it's impossible to tell where Gershwin's contributions end and Brian's begin.  For those who've witnessed the blossoming of Brian's soul since the completion of SMiLE, open your ears again - Brian Wilson Reimagines Gershwin is one of his all-time best.

B003FSTN5C|5.0|Academy Award winner Linda Hunt really makes the show different than NCIS (or any other investigation type show).

B0031OCY2E|5.0|Please help me understand how the portrayal of a mental ill individual in a great film about corporate greed is boring, challenging, or not entertaining to watch.  It goes to show how ignorant we continue to be about mental health issues.    As someone who has destroyed his career several times from suffering with bipolar and schizophrenia, this film gives you a very accurate portrayal of our condition.  The corn and polar bear scenes while entertaining to some and boring to others is very much how our brains work.  Dragging our spouses into our messes is what we do, it is part of the disease.  WE CAN NOT CONTROL ourselves, it is not something we can control like alcohol.    The film was very entertaining, well thought out and a great representation of corporate greed and manic depressive issues.
B003JTHETY|5.0|a track-by-track review.     1. \\"Satellite 15... The Final Frontier\\" (Smith, Harris)   Contrary to what you might have been led to believe by the official video, this song is actually 8:40 minutes long, half of it being a very, very, very unusual intro for Iron Maiden -- 4:40 minutes of an eerie piece of futuristic, space-like, void-feeling material, slow-paced but at the same time emanating disturbing melodies before those known hard-rock chords can soar. From then on it's the same thing you hear on the band's official video.     2. \\"El Dorado\\" (Smith, Harris, Dickinson)   Not much to say. GOOD SONG BUT I'm just very glad that it's probably the worst song on the album.     3. \\"Mother of Mercy\\" (Smith, Harris)   Rather slow-paced, not a rapid, furious & heavy-rhythm'ed as I had thought it would be before listening to it. It's a tune I actually wouldn't picture Iron Maiden coming up with. It's very Maiden in its simplicity, but at the same time the melody itself is not usual in terms of what we've witnessed in the past 15 years. Which is, I must say, something that pervades the entire album, this tendency to venture into the unexplored.     4. \\"Coming Home\\" (Smith, Harris, Dickinson)   Wow, a balad. But this sounds very much like a Bruce Dickinson ballad, rather than an Iron Maiden one. Think \\"Tyranny of Souls\\" (the album), though (not \\"Accident of Birth\\"). Very catchy chorus, and a very nice melody throughout. I'm thinking the band will be playing this one live.   5. \\"The Alchemist\\" (Gers, Harris, Dickinson)   Truly, this has nothing to do with Bruce's homonymous song. Not quite unlike what's Maiden's done since 2000, however. This one's more forward than the previous tracks (Satellite 15 excepted), with a nice chorus too, mainly because of the guitar trio coming up with those harmonic combinations that completely fill out the background. There's also some modulation thrown in, which you don't see a lot in Maiden. I personally enjoy the guitar melody on the bridgeand chorus for this song. Solo exclusively by Janick, followed by the 3 guitars. Falls back to the chorus and the song ends (very similar to the \\"Coming Home\\" approach).     6. \\"Isle of Avalon\\" (Smith, Harris)   If it weren't for the bass right in the beginning, you wouldn't guess this is a Maiden tune, even though it is somehow in synch with what the band's been doing since Kevin Shirley took up the production seat with the boys. Mysterious-like melody, but fast-paced intro, which holds on for a good 2 and a half minutes before it finally picks up at around 2:50, with an interesting vigor. It falls again to a certain mystery-ridden melody right after, before a short Dave Murray solo kicks in at around 3:40, followed by some solid rhythm-base session, and then by Adrian playing a little with what seem to be synthetizers (you may hear some Somewhere in Time-like material at this point, even though the song itself is far from that). You gotta think in terms of epic-like material, in the same line as Alexander the Great, Seventh Son of a Seventh Son and Sign of the Cross. It's 9 minutes long, and it's one of those songs where you'll pay closer attention to the lyrics while some interesting tune plays in the background (and not the other way around). The chorus is very nice, however, and brings the melody forward.     7. \\"Starblind\\" (Smith, Harris, Dickinson)   I thought it would be another slow song, but then some distortion guitars kick in, gladly. The main part of the song (not the bridge or chorus) is a very solid crescendo, whih sounds very amazing to me, and they build just the right amount of expectation. Bridge's very good too, and you know you got something good on your hands. It's hard to correctly describe this song. It's not fast, but it's not exactly slow-paced either. It's a very interesting tune, really, with a few unexpected twist and turns, and sometimes some of its distortion guitar levels sound as though they had nothing but a Fender-like sound to it,as if they had only had said Fender amp to provide heaviness (this goes mainly for Adrian or Janick). Adrian seems to have used synthetizers for his soloes, however -- with some mean reverb on them. Bruce does very well here, singing a solid tune with variations, going from low to high-pitched notes in the same sentence. There's some modulation present here, too. All in all it's a good song, and you may feel hooked even though it's almost 8-minutes long.     8. \\"The Talisman\\" (Gers, Harris)   Beautiful beginning. The production and general feel very closely resemble what you hear in \\"The Legacy\\" (A Matter if Life and Death's last track). This actually perdures for 2:20 minutes until some power rhythm guitars kick in with more solid, heavy riffs making the bed where Bruce seems to comfortably lie in. Very forward tune, which I thought somewhat lacking at times, because it's a long album, and some of the tunes (like \\"Mother of Mercy\\" and \\"Coming Home\\" being put together, one after the other) sort of gives you the feeling that things are somewhat slow for a while. Also, much like \\"Dance of Death\\" and \\"A Matter of Life and Death\\", this album is filled with little, slow acoustic intros that tend to make you feel like there isn't much punch or drive to it. \\"The Talisman\\" can show a lot of raw power, however, which is always a good thing when it comes to Maiden. Nice vocal melodies at around 5 minutes into the song, with great soloes right after. They remind me some of the material on \\"Fear is the Key\\", probably because of the vibrato unit/tremolo bar being used. Good song.     9. \\"The Man Who Would Be King\\" (Dave Murray, Harris)   Again slow intro. But nice follow-up, with solid bass chords underlying the guitar melody -- which, to be honest, remind me a lot of \\"Out of the Silent Planet\\". The drums come in, in a crescendo, and then we got some heavy, forward-sounding riffs and Bruce's vocal lines (which now remind me somewhat of \\"The Thin Line Between Love and Hate\\"). All in all this is a tune of its own, truly. As you reach 4 minutes, you will be listening to some really (really!) different material. I'm betting you could never guess this to be Iron Maiden. Very unlike what's been done in 30 years of history. You'll understand what I mean when you listen to this. At around 6 minutes, when Bruce sings again, his vocal lines remind me of Dance of Death's \\"Wildest Dreams\\". This song's 8-and-a-half minutes long, and it does feel long (unlike other, longer Iron Maiden tunes, I must say).     10. \\"When the Wild Wind Blows\\"   Last -- and longest -- song on the album. As usual, a slow-paced intro, but gladly, off the top of my head, it doesn't remind me of any other Maiden song. It's as if it wants to, but it doesn't. Beautiful tune, really, and great change of pace at around 3:40. Adrian comes in with a solo at 4:46, followed by Dave, and both melodies are tremendously beautiful. This is possibly the song with most potential on the whole album, and I'm very pleased to say that even though it's 11:01 minutes long, ranking as the 3rd longest Iron Maiden song

As usual, a slow-paced intro, but gladly, off the top of my head, it doesn't remind me of any other Maiden song. It's as if it wants to, but it doesn't. Beautiful tune, really, and great change of pace at around 3:40. Adrian comes in with a solo at 4:46, followed by Dave, and both melodies are tremendously beautiful. This is possibly the song with most potential on the whole album, and I'm very pleased to say that even though it's 11:01 minutes long, ranking as the 3rd longest Iron Maiden song
0470449748|5.0|I feel that the Official GMAT Review is a necessary study guide when preparing for the GMAT. If you are going to get anything out of this book, try to understand how the test takers think in designing the questions and answers. I would also complement this book with other study material to get more detailed explanations and practice. I felt that the answer explanations for some of the problem solving questions can be too time consuming if you do the work the way they do it. Instead, I would study the math examples from the Kaplan or Ace the GMAT to find easier ways of doing the math problems.     I strongly recommend that you download the two practice prep tests from the GMAT website [...]  The scores you get on these two tests will be very similar to what you get on the actual GMAT. In fact, the score that I got on the second prep test was identical to the score that I got on the actual GMAT. Practice these prep tests over and over so you get an idea of how to pace yourself and what types of questions to expect. Try doing the entire prep test including the essay sections just like you are taking the actual GMAT. The GMAT is a long test and you might find yourself losing stamina towards the end. So practice the full prep tests until you feel comfortable doing the entire test. You may also want to switch out the two essays from each prep test with essays from the Official Guide. Although the math and verbal questions can change (especially when you start to get higher scores), the two essays questions remained the same. I only wish they had more prep tests to practice with.
B0036TGSR6|4.0|This movie has the same feel as the high-tension \\"Torn Curtain,\\" the classic Hitchcock thriller starring Paul Newman and Julie Andrews. Like that earlier film, this one plummets a civilian into international intrigue where he is left to shift for himself. He has to use all his ingenuity and wiles to evade the conspiracy that he feels taking shape around him. He senses danger at every turn, but since he isn't sure what door it's coming in through, he can't be sure which door to leave by.     There are major stars in this film who play their parts brilliantly. Tom Wilkinson is chilling in his portrayal of civilized menace. Pierce Brosnan does a wonderful job as the ex-Prime Minister whose hearty manner increasingly seems to be a mask he wears to hide ruthlessness.     The only problem is - the stakes in this game are hardly high enough to warrant all the characters' sinister maneuvering. In \\"Torn Curtain,\\" Newman and Andrews were up against the concerted forces of the deadly Cold War competition. Secrets about new atomic weapons were at stake. Here the forces being arrayed against Ewan McGregor's character are motivated by a desire to either make or break the ex-Prime Minister's reputation. One faction is working to make a cause celebre of his orders to have four suspected terrorists water-boarded in order to force them to reveal their connections. The opposing faction is working to cover-up this ugly aspect of his regime in order to protect his place in history and his Party's chances in the next round of elections.    Ordering the torture of detainees is certainly reprehensible, but it's hardly the stuff of international intrigue. As McGregor makes his way through this contrived danger and tries to ghost write an autobiography for the ex-Prime Minister that is neither a fluff piece nor unintentionally incriminating - he does begin to find that the over-shadowing conspiracy has a root system larger than the single issue of the treatment of detainees. But this largerissue turns out to supply an even less convincing reason for murderous plotting. This international game of poker with nothing convincing at stake then devolves into a completely trumped up exercise.    Without Nazis or KGB, or without directly invoking terrorist infiltration - modern political thrillers have a hard time conjuring up realistic threats. So this movie is a snow globe, a shining example of acting, dialogue, and cinematography, all encasing a harmless miniature of motive. But if you can just imagine those bygone blocs and inject some sense of the threat they posed into this plot, you can enjoy the craft of this film.    Plus, it has an authentically inventive, poignant ending.
1439181780|2.0|I loved the Secret and couldn't wait for this book's release.  I went on the Secret's website and was able to see The Power's table of contents, read the Forward and part of chapter one.  There was also a video trailer for The Power.  After reviewing all of that, I decided to pass.  It looked like an extension of the Secret - without introducing any new principles like \\"The Law of Attraction.\\"  I agree with the customer review that pointed towards Eckhart Tolle's work.
1601251831|5.0|When Dungeons and Dragons 4.0 came out, my friends and I were disappointed in its simplicity and basic natured role-playing. We were die-hard 3.5 fans and 4.0 was nothing like what we loved. When I found out about Pathfinder, I immediately fell in love with it. As if its beautiful artwork was not enough, Pathfinder takes everything that 3.5 was and makes it BETTER! The monsters contained in this book is just plain LEGIT! A half-fiend minotaur? A half-dragon basilisk? Move over 4.0, 3.5 THRIVES!!!
0143118420|4.0|Tell me that the ennui and despair that author Liz Gilbert describes in her memoir \\"Eat, Pray, Love: One Woman's Search for Everything Across Italy, India and Indonesia,\\" hasn't been experienced at least once by any modern man/woman in the Western world attempting to juggle and succeed at rearing a family, sustaining a fulfilling marriage and pursuing personal dreams while maintaining a solid sense of self identity.  It goes with the territory of growth.  Mindful people question the phases and stages of their lives whether or not they work well in the context of how we or other people see and measure us.  If the comfortable sense of flow that leads to a feeling of contentment in what we do and what we decide to create and accomplish does not exist, we invariably sink into the bog of the failure mindset that necessitates the various forms of high and low level anesthesia (drugs, alcohol, over-eating, shopping, self-indulgence--whatever stifles the pain) and we struggle to make sense of what and who we are as individuals and as a global population.  As a paid writer, Gilbert lucks out; she gets to vent her spleen in exotic locations and turn her outpourings into a book while grounding her wellbeing with the smell of pizza, incense and durian.  Procuring the backing of the Oprah moneymaking machine to promote her personal quest rockets her off into the stratosphere of turning profits that rivals the hyper-speed of Star Trek tribble-breeding.  That's amore, nirvana and Bali Ha'i all mixed into one.<br /><br />Other reviewers label Gilbert as the ultimate narcissist--a whining American who has it all and feels entitled to even more.  Whether she is or not, is the call of the reader.  Can she create an atmosphere of empathy where her audience feels her pain, relates to it and relishes her desire to find a personal synergy between earthly pleasures, heavenly devotion and the balance that ultimately leads to the stability to move fearlessly through the unchartered waters of an interesting life?  Perhaps, if she can charm you into liking her as she does in her affable almost girly-girl BFF (Best Friends Forever) way.<br /><br />For me, \\"Eat, Pray, Love\\" is an amusing pretension--the psychological journaling of a woman coming to terms with an unhappy marriage, a devastating divorce and an unfulfilling affair.  She gets to get out of Dodge, all expenses paid.  As she eats her way through Rome, she analyzes her loneliness and depression, trying to define herself in terms of her own expectations.  Is she too much of a perfectionist?  Is she a repressed Protestant?  As an American does she need to achieve?  Be the successful writer?  Have her own labels defined her?  Gilbert touches on some of this, but does she draw any conclusions that mean anything to the rest of us?  Or are these little essays just bits of disjointed scribbles that eventually formulate a book about a year away from home?<br /><br />At times, this is just what I think.  As the year passes, Gilbert moves away from the pain of her misery.  Distance and cultural differences separate her neatly from her leading men.  She cries for them but is she not, in essence, bewailing her inability to be cute enough to get what she wants out of the circumstances in which she finds herself?  Nevertheless, Gilbert's section on her time at the Indian ashram, albeit the slowest portion of this three-part book, resonates with the most truth for me.  In this, the second leg of her journey, she forgets to be the ever-lovable Liz until the very last portion when she is chosen as a greeter for the Ashram's 2-week seminar sessions. The murky nature of her struggles to understand the mechanics of meditation while relaying factoids regarding the spiritual understanding of mystics like St Theresa Avila and Rumi work well with Gilbert's contemplative dealings with her own unbalanced nature.  In her fervor, she forgets to be our girl Liz and just is--toppling over herself with her understanding of self and the slow but steady process of quieting her mind and coming to terms with just coming to terms.<br /><br />Some reviewers have also balked at the idea of the spiritual journey ending with the discovery of yet another man in the Gilbert collection.  Perhaps the only way that Gilbert knew that she had healed was by the fact that she was able to let another man into her life without fearing the pain that is sure to come with any relationship.  The ability to share one's wisdom and experience--to give without losing the self--truly indicates development.  In this, Gilbert accomplishes her mission--at least until the end of this memoir.  Along this line, her desire to help Wayan purchase her house with the aid of funds from her friends around the world, although considerate, seems self-aggrandizing.  Isn't the beauty of an unselfish act made more beautiful when the instigator doesn't promote or attempt to sell it as a thing of rarity?  Find stillness in gentle actions that require no discussion--not a judgment, just a statement.<br /><br />However, for the most part, her work seems disjointed--more a personal diary that needed more editing to make it work as an entire book, not only as journey of self-discovery, but as a work of literature with meaning to the beginning, middle and ending that suggests more synergistic realizations.  Gilbert's musings are her private moments, many of which are so private they don't really make sense to the reader who does not fully understand the background emotions or intimate details of just why Gilbert was unhappy in her marriage and why her relationship with David fell so flat.  And in this sense, \\"Eat, Pray, Love\\" falls short, yet brands our era.  How could anyone possibly understand such inner turmoil when the turmoil remains undefined, nebulous, that sad little state of ennui that attacks us like the most virulent bombardment of middle-aged crazy since that joked of in [[ASIN:B000059TFL City Slickers]]?  Nevertheless, the search for inner peace, at the ashram or the yoga studio with New Age sensibilities pointing back toward ancient mysteries in long-forgotten languages about blue-faced gods is indicative of who we are in this the first half of the 21st century.  Gilbert's book points out our sameness in the sense that we all have a similar inner dialogue--not to want more--but to be joined in an Akasha of contentment.<br /><br />Bottom line?  \\"Eat, Pray, Love: One Woman's Search for Everything Across Italy, India and Indonesia,\\" relates the one year author Liz Gilbert spent searching for meaning and inner peace as she attempts to answer life's big questions and rectify decisions and desires that impact not only herself but her various significant others.  As a travelogue/memoir, the book works, spewing out insider's factoids about Italian, Indian and Balinese cultures and sensibilities seen from Gilbert's fairly middle American perspective.  Her delayed-hippie fixation with the devotional practices of her chosen guru's ashram seems indicative of au courant intellectual pursuits that meld with her personal self-healing and thankfully stay fairly rigid and true in format to the search for God Far Eastern-style.

B002JVWR9U|4.0|I thought the show would be worse than Twilight. Its setup is identical: a vampire falls in love with a high school girl. To my surprise, The Vampire Diaries kept me tuning in every week.<br /><br />Our heroine Elena (Nina Dobrev) lives in the historic Virginia town Mystic Falls. Her parents recently died in a car crash, leaving her and her dope-head brother Jeremy (Steve McQueen) in the care of their young aunt Jenna (Sara Canning), a lovable pal but sucky guardian. Elena's grief causes her to bond with the - unbeknownst to her - nice vampire stalker Stefan (Paul Wesley). Unfortunately, he has a vampire brother who is not so nice. Damon (Ian Somerhalder) enjoys making his brother's life miserable and has no qualms about eating humans. He also notices that Elena looks exactly like their (yes, their) ex who lived more than a century ago.<br /><br />Other cast members include Elena's cute ex Matt (Zach Roerig), his a-hole best friend Tyler (Michael Trevino), and Tyler's druggie girlfriend Vicki (Kayla Ewell). She is also Matt's sister and Jeremy's love. The town is incestuous. Then there are Elena's best friends Bonnie (Katerina Graham) and Caroline (Candice Accola). Bonnie is sweet and supportive; Caroline is blond and bitchy.<br /><br />It's... Believable<br /><br />For a cheesy show about gorgeous townsfolk and creatures of the night, it's surprisingly realistic. (Note: I am used to television-hot actors not CW-hot. These people look like no one I've met.) The most initially stereotypical characters turn out to be some of the most complex.<br /><br />It's Funny<br /><br />The Vampire Diaries doesn't take itself too seriously. The heroine's best friend matter-of-factly explains why she is psychic. They laugh at such a preposterous notion. (So does the audience, for other reasons, of course.) One vampire advises another: \\"You're dead, dude. Get over it.\\"<br /><br />It's Surprising<br /><br />Even though the series borrows heavily from previous vampire/teen stories, it follows its own path. It uses and plays with formulas. The pilot features Elena running through a foggy graveyard, complete with an ominous crow. It also quickly dissolves a budding love triangle clich&eacute; because a character actually acts sensibly.<br /><br />It's Consistent<br /><br />They've done a darn good job with the vampire mythology. The explanations, including questions of vampire morality, have a basic logic. Not only that, but the tone, pacing, and character development are dependable. Unlike many shows, actions (usually) have consequences. Characters have motivations and don't forget about what they did the previous week.<br /><br />The vampire \\"look\\" is perhaps the best I've seen. When vamps get blood hungry they sprout fangs. Eyes become bloodshot and veiny. These immortal serial killers are scary twists on their human selves, beastlike and vicious.<br /><br />The writing and acting are respectable. Nina Dobrev can be grating in a teenager-y way, but her Elena is an appealing character. Paul Wesley is somewhat one note, but he brings a wisdom and tenderness to the role of Stefan. That he manages to be less than creepy is a remarkable feat which alone elevates the show far above Twilight. Ian Somerhalder clearly relishes playing Damon, who is funny, flirtatious, and wicked, but perhaps not irredeemable.<br /><br />Certain scenes are ridiculous and unintentionally hilarious, but the camp is part of the fun. Due to historical echoes, intertwining relationships, and flashbacks to the brothers' vampire births, the show borders on epic.

030726999X|5.0|I've read all three of the Steig Larson \\"Girl\\" books and loved them all. The Hornet's Nest was a little confusing because there were many, many characters and sometimes it was hard to keep them straight. But the book tied up all the ends and answered the questions from the other two.

B0027BOL4G|4.0|I only wish more people would get this message and start watching their diets. Very informative. We really need to watch what we are feeding our children. We are a very loud voice to the commercial food industry when we refuse to BUY foods that are not good for us.  I don't have a problem eating meat, however, there should also be a respect for their giving life to us and there should be value placed on the way and the amount of foods we take from animals. A big part of turning this thing around and not abusing our power is properly educating our children and living as a example.

One question you may ask after readind this; have they changed or something? No, they have not. You will find the same band here with their predictable track listing just longer at lenght, like the last song being the typical Harris epic but without any inspiration this time.

B002ZG97RE|3.0|Take Jason Bourne character for which Matt Damon is famous, put him in BDUs, and surround him with the political influences and military consequences of the hunt for WMDs in Iraq, and you've got yourself a hit.  Or so you think...<br /><br />The Green Zone is the story of Chief Warrant Officer Roy Miller (Damon), a man whose team is responsible for finding WMDs in Iraq.  Much like Ben Affleck's trophy shelf for acting, Miller's team continues to come up empty.  One must question the intelligence that leads to so many duds, but enough about [[ASIN:B001U0HAZW Paycheck]] and [[ASIN:B00029LO5E Jersey Girl]].  Only after he begins the hunt for the \\"Jack of Clubs\\" - which, incidentally, was the original target from a mission past that ended up at the Baghdad Jack in the Box - does Miller get frustrated and decide to go rogue, leaning on a one-legged Iraqi local to untie a complicated knot similar to the one I had in my stomach after watching [[ASIN:B000059MQ4 Bounce]].  From that point it's a perilous thriller/action film, with chase scenes galore, bullets aplenty, a great soundtrack, very crisp editing, professional acting (no one really stood out), and enough political conspiracy theories - tied mostly to scheming Pentagon politico Clark Poundstone (Greg Kinnear) - that I broke out the tinfoil.  (Honestly, would it kill Hollywood to step away from the second helping of Thanksgiving propaganda?)<br /><br />Just go into it with intentions of ignoring the political bias, enjoying most of the action.  And the freedom with which Miller's team gallivants about Iraq?  Completely unbelievable, like [[ASIN:B00000G3PA Armageddon]]<br /><br />The filming was on shaky-cam overload; call it the migraine-cam.  It's \\"watching Cloverfield on a laptop while riding a rollercoaster during an earthquake\\"-shaky.  There are chases and gunplay scenes that are almost indiscernible.  The overload of one second burst-movements almost made me have a different kind of movement, one that stinks, like [[ASIN:B0000DKDUT Gigli]].<br /><br />Overall, Green Zone is some fact more fiction, mostly shock sometimes awe, and far too insistent on pushing a tired political message and creating conspiratorial connections between Damon and Kinnear when it would have benefitted more if the two actors were physically connected like in [[ASIN:B00005JMG8 Stuck On You]].Gigli]].

0446567337|5.0|Yes, it was a well deserved 5 stars.  But if I based it how I wanted the book to turn out, I might have only given it 4 stars. This book does end \\"happily ever after\\" even if it is not the \\"happily ever after\\" I would have picked for the characters.<br /><br />I knew going into this that this author had a reputation for writing books that did not always end the way people hoped and that tissues were often a necessity.  After reading the first half of the book where Savannah and John fall in love, in just one sitting.  I did not want to go on, because I knew once he left, it would never be the same again. I wanted to saver the thoughts of their first two weeks together. It took me two full days before I could pick it up again.  I also knew that once I picked it up, there would be no putting it down - and I was correct!<br /><br />I read through the the rest of the book - and it was amazing.  My favorite part (in the second half) was in the last chapter where Tim and John talk about their possible futures.  I know this was an eye opening time for John and what finally caused him to make the ultimate sacrifice.  This is followed by an amazing epilogue where tissues were necessary. The story does end, like I said, \\"happily ever after\\",  but not the way I wanted it to. I highly recommend this book - it was great and hope to read it again some day and possibly watch the movie, but I know it can never be as good as this book.
B002LLE3PY|5.0|When I bought \\"Lizard\\" and listened to it for the 1st time, I thought, \\"What the *#!!*# is this crap?\\" Upon subsequent listens, I felt the same way. This is a tough album to acquire a taste for. Keep trying because, once it clicks-oh man, what an album!! I read somewhere that Fripp thought it would take around 24 listens to truly appreciate this album. I still find little nuances when I listen to it that all-of-a-sudden make sense. I dare you not to laugh along with Gordon  at the end of \\"Indoor Games\\"! The boys slowly bring along Track 5 (the title track) to a crescendo at around 15 minutes into the song and lasting about 3 minutes. IMHO, this is one of the the greatest jam moments in recorded history. The way all the layers of instrumentation work together, well, it makes waiting the 13+ minutes worth while. And by the way, you'll learn to like the build up as well. The anticipation of what's ahead is delicious!<br /> A really brilliant album. The highlight to me is Andy McCullouch's incredible drumming. A lot of character-filled vocals by Gordon Haskell. Surprisingly, NOT that much guitar from Fripp as on other KC albums, he's on Mellotron as much as guitar here. What gutar he does play, however, is tasty. His one-take solo near the end of track 5 is hauntigly brilliant.<br />This package features the traditional(although wonderfully remastered)CD, PLUS a DVD-Audio disc featuring 5.1 surround that thrillingly separates each instrument and brings out stuff buried in the original mix.<br />A thoroughly entertaining sonic thrillride. Enjoy something that most people never will appreciate!!
B000QFAJ7S|3.0|I was very excited to purchase this CD, because I really love Kelly's voice, etc. etc.  Also,I purchased \\"Don't Waste Your Time\\" from the album on iTunes, and I'd heard \\"Never Again\\" on radio stations and such, and I love the songs.  I was accordingly very excited to get this new album.  I don't think it's the best, however.  True, she wrote the album at the bottom-most point in her life we've heard, but the rest of the album seemed mediocre.  Not as bombastic as her voice is, or the other two songs that I've previously mentioned.  I suppose a die-hard fan of Kelly Clarkson would buy this album to support her, but I wish I had just bought the few good songs on iTunes instead of purchasing the entire album.
B002RI9ZQ8|2.0|Very overrated book. I've now read the three books in the series and it's been a struggle. The writer is long winded, giving long drawn out descriptions of people and events that are irrelevant to the story. Unless you like excessive details in stories, I suspect you will also find this annoying.<br />I suspect many Europeans are raising the rating of this book and the others in the series for patriotic reasons, because the book doesn't deserve the high ratings.<br />1. The writer seems to hate men. In his book many, many men are either paedophiles (or closet paedophiles with pictures of children on their computer), stalkers of women or men who hate women to the extent that they will torture them.

0971407614|5.0|When I first ordered this book I was not sure what to expect. I would consider myself to be somewhat knowledgeable in workouts at the gym but not so much with workouts at home, with no weights. Once I received the book and began to read it I was not only surprised to see so how many home workouts he went over but his story of how he gained all of this knowledge is even more remarkable.     His YouTube videos that go over a few of the exercises are helpful too. The one arm push up is pretty crazy.    Awesome story and the workouts are second to none. I would definitely recommend this book to everyone.

The writer is long winded, giving long drawn out descriptions of people and events that are irrelevant to the story.

In his book many, many men are either paedophiles (or closet paedophiles with pictures of children on their computer), stalkers of women or men who hate women to the extent that they will torture them.

B000002L9J|5.0|Ok, for the novice Smith fan, steer clear of the \\"Best-of\\" compilations out there. Most are uneven and they throw in a few clunkers that are really out of place, ala the 'Louder Than Bombs' album. Start here with The Queen Is Dead. It flows perfectly, and has 6 of the best Smiths tracks on it. After this album, pick up Meat is Murder, which in my view, is Johnny Marr's best guitar work. Barbarism Begins at Home is worth the asking price alone. Next up, check out their debut.
B003AO3CIK|4.0|Ok, so often I hear a song and I want to hear more like it.  Please, anyone reading this review, if you love the sound of the first song you must buy Teenage Fanclub's disc \\"Songs From Northern Britain\\".  It is the exact sound and it is an amazing disc.  I'm sure Nada Surf loves Teenage Fanclub by their sound,  so if you dig them, check out the Fannies.
B001PB3RU8|5.0|great album. each song is great. number 9 and 10 are the best. amazing work. heard it on xm radio and had to get the full cd. you will not be disappointed.
B002QH2NUA|5.0|I have some other DVD's of McCartney tours and I really enjoy them.  However, I LOVE this one.  I saw Paul McCartney in July 2010 as part of his Up and Coming tour.  The concert was so good that I was going to fly to another city to see him again while on this tour.  I was searching around for some more Macca DVD's to play and I came across this one. This package contains 2 audio discs and one DVD all with the same songs.  The set list on this DVD is almost identical to the concert I saw in July.  I have this playing on my TV a lot and I love it. Watching it has saved me a ton of money flying to another city and trying to get a decent seat to see him again!  I truly love this DVD. It is very well done and brings back great memories of the concert I saw.
B0032Y8XH8|5.0|just an amazing wonderful album. such deep themes and great lyrics. couldnt have found a better album. heard it on xm radio and now the rest of the songs are finding their way on the radio. each song is better and better.
B003JTHESA|3.0|It is well known the influence that progressive music has in Steve Harris; however, this influence was not transmitted to the albums recorded by the band in the 80s.  By contrast in the 80s Maiden albums were characterized by fast, melodious, short and full of energy songs, metal at its best and thanks to that, the band became legendary throughout the world and without the help of radio or television.  From the 90's onwards, with the departure of producer Martin Birch, Harris progressive influence on the band is remarkable, instead of having one epic track by record, now we have an album full with epic songs, without being true epic like Seventh Son of a Seventh Son or Rime of the Ancient Mariner.  Personally I like the progressive course that has taken by the band, albums like Brave New World and AMOLAD are very good with only 2 o 3 bad songs in each one, the Blaze Bayley era doesn't count, Dance of Death is perhaps the weakest to date only about 3 really good songs and the rest of the album is totally to forget.  Final Frontier is very similar to Dance of Death, with three good songs and the rest are very disappointing.  Most of the songs are terribly, boring and to long without the energy and rhythm of songs like Powersalve, The Evil That Man do, The Nomad or For the Greater Good of God.  It seems that the time of greatness pass many years ago and the trend of the band shows its desire to go towards in the progressive music rather than metal and is a shame and waste for artists that are capable to do great things in the metal genre, but not in the progressive. If you want to hear progressive, then you buy a Porcupine album or whatever, but the true is we want some, fast, non-repetitive, melodic, and furious metal albums with passion, like old times!
B003ITZBVI|4.0|I have watched this movie about 10 times now and I just cant get over the voice of the Joker. His voice  more like a thug then the quintessential cracky voice that I am so used to.The storyline was fantastic I thought it flowed flawlessly and a few parts kept me on the edge of my seat. but alas I have grown up with one voice of the Joker and he doesn't sound like a deep voiced thug. (I believe this was more about popularity of the actor and not staying within the same ideal of the the original joker.)
B003CNQPNS|5.0|hi i'm joseph pirc an i think street hawk dvd series is really a great dvd to get if you are a street hawk fan
B003JTHETY|5.0|First off, you need to listen to this CD at least a few times before making a judgement, and don't expect any quick radio friendly hits. Like the last three albums, most of the songs are long and progressive. I happen to like the fact that they have changed with time, adding more complex epics. They aren't getting rid of the old classics people. In fact, I saw them live last month for the first time and most of the crowd knew the newer tunes as much as the concert staples. And yes, of course they rocked. Probably the best live show I've seen, including the stage spectacle that is KISS, who I've seen three times.<br /><br />It's hard to single out an individual song, since they are all good in many different ways. Interestingly enough, the first single released, El Dorado, is my least favorite song on the entire album. I do have to admit that the intro, Satellite 15, is very weird, especially by Iron Maiden standards. Most of the songs start off slow and build to a melodic chorus. The title track and The Alchemist are the most straight forward \\"Iron Maiden\\" sounding songs. They are both super catchy and should be on the radio, while When The Wild Wind Blows closes things out beautifully. Overall, the musicianship is always fantastic from the trio of guitars, drums, bass, and Bruce Dickinson still has a great voice for his age. He sang just as clear when I saw them in concert, not to mention his off the charts energy. The dude was doing jumping high kicks off the speaker amps!<br /><br />If you only like the Maiden sound before Brave New World, you're not going to like this, but for those of us who don't mind the longer musical journeys of recent releases, you won't be able to get enough of The Final Frontier. The album title had me scared this was going to be the end, but fear not, they'll be back.
1416550550|5.0|\\"The Forgotten Garden\\" is a mystery that kept me spellbound. The women characters, Adeline, Rose, Nell, Georgiana, Eliza, and Cassandra are all related in an intriguing story that covers nearly a century. The surprising secrecies are discovered one by one and come to a well-rounded closing, though I wished Eliza a happier ending. Confusing is the going back and forth in time and place; at every chapter. I recommend a second reading in order to get a clear picture of all the scenes and imported information that's easily missed. Martina Vanderley, Author of \\"Crossroads at the Wilderness.\\"
B002ZG999U|3.0|I went to see this movie cause Stallone said it didn't have any computer generated wizardry. It was OK. I managed to sit through the whole movie. Unlike the A Team, where I walked out within the 1st 15 mins. Except for the last song, the sound tract sucks! It just didn't sound right. Not like Jackie Brown or Pulp Fiction. Now those sound tracks are worth buying, and how!!!  P.S. I so wanted to shout out, \\"The terminator can't even govern, much less be president!\\"
B003JTHETY|5.0|Having grown up in the 80's to Maiden I am happily surprised at how their music has continued to not only grow but get better over their long career. The Final Frontier is just simply amazing. Everything on the album from Nicko's drums, to the triple guitars of Smith, Gers, and Murray, to Harris' unique bass style, to air raid Bruce's vocals, to finally the caveman Shirley's production is simply A+. As with all of Maiden's albums from Brave New World to this new one they just keep getting better and better. Don't get me wrong the classic 80's Maiden material is great in its own right, but this new stuff, especially Final Frontier, is just mind blowing. If you are a fan pick it up, if you want to hear some great metal buy it, hell if you just want to hear some great musicians at work get this album. Up the Irons!!

B002VPE1XE|4.0|You really can't beat this six dollar case in terms of value for money.  It's lined with soft velcro, has a front pocket big enough for batteries and has a little convenient strap.  The big minus is that the case is flat which means that it's probably best for camera phones.  Like another reviewer we use ours for our GPS.  It's perfect for that.  As is the price.
B000026OHN|5.0|How is it possible to describe the brilliance of these recordings? Pure, intelligent pianism - absolute perfection. This is Bach where you want him - at those lofty untouchable heights ...    The recording, by the way, has a permanent reverberant echo as if the peddle was down all the time. But all the same, the tonal contrast and timbre of the piano has been well preserved. So 5 stars despite the quality of the sound!

B003KUSUG8|1.0|I've been a long time Eminem fan, but this album doesn't compare to even Relapse itself.  I don't get it, he claims he's king of rap in \\"Not Afraid\\" but apologizes to the arrogant Kanye West and terrible MC Lil Wayne that he felt threatened by how good they are (from his perspective).  Well, maybe it's up to debate now, since he's taken himself down a couple of notches in this new release.  I guess good things can't last forever, meaning the angsty and controversial Eminem is long gone now.

B003VANOFY|5.0|***UPDATE 5/3/2013***<br />Okay, so I've had this set for almost 3 years now.  About a month ago I did have to replace the charger (my own fault, cord got damaged) and while I was doing so I replaced the battery for the first time as, with all rechargeables, it had degraded a bit.  Going through logitech's website I was able to get the battery kit for 5 and the charger for 10.  I'm hoping to get another 3 years out of this set.<br /><br />Some updated impressions:  After 3 years the faux leather covering over the ear pads has worn off a bit.  I wear glasses and I've noticed that most of the wear is where my glasses rub them.  I can't fault logitech for this really, and I don't notice it when I wear them.<br /><br />My signal range seems to have degraded just a little, and I'm considering replacing the wireless dongle as well (which can be done directly through logitech for 10 bucks).<br /><br />I won't deny the photo evidence regarding the plastic ear cup joints that people have posted in the comments on this review, but I will say that I've had this headset for almost 3 years, I'm a bit of a clumsy drunk at times (especially when gaming), and while I definitely haven't abused the headset it has been dropped from time to time.  Other than the ear pad coverings and a few scuffs, you'd never know it wasn't brand new.  Maybe I'm just lucky, I don't know, but the three headsets I bought before this one (all in the 50-100 dollar range) each lasted less than a year.  Under the same treatment, this headset has outlasted all 3 of them.  Honestly, if they broke right now I would probably buy the same set again.  I haven't found much else that provides the same functionality in the same price range.<br /><br />My long term impression of sound quality--audiophiles prolly wouldn't be satisfied, you can't crank them obscenely loud with strong bass without hearing some distortion.  However, they definitely more hold their own in terms of gaming oriented headsets.  At reasonable volume levels they're crisp and clear with good bass.  I have grown addicted to the 7.1.  I often tell people in first person shooters that 70% of my aiming is through sound at this point.  It's hard to play without it.<br /><br />My only real complaint is that the software is a bit buggy.  Sometimes you have to relaunch it for the headset to be recognized properly and to get proper 7.1 playback.  It's not much of a problem...but it can be annoying.<br /><br />_______________<br />First, off, I've only had this headset for a day.  I can't really go into detail about sound quality, how good the surround sound is, etc.  However, I feel like I need to clarify a couple of things.<br /><br />There are two major issues that people have been complaining about with this headset:  the \\"flimsy plastic\\" joints holding the ear cups on, and the lack of a graphic equalizer.  Please disregard anyone who mentions either of these two \\"problems,\\" because it is completely false.<br /><br />If you look closely at the ear cup joints, yes, there is plastic there.  However, if you pay attention, the plastic isn't actually the part that's moving.  It's merely a covering for the actual joint.  On the back of the box, under \\"Durability,\\" it clearly states that the joints are made from an aircraft grade aluminum alloy.  This is a very well made product guys, I get no sense that, if treated properly (take your game rage out on something that costs a bit less, children) it will ever break on me.<br /><br />Now, I'm not quite sure why people are saying there's no graphic equalizer, and that they are limited to bass and treble adjustments.  Directly below the bass/treble bars, there's a big button that looks like a graphic equalizer.  If you click it, guess what happens.  Yep, a 10 band EQ pops right up, complete with preamp volume adjustment.  If you have this turned on, it grays out and overrides the bass/treble adjustments.<br /><br />Now that I've cleared that up, I'll give my one day impressions on the product.<br /><br />Super comfortable.  I have a fairly large head, and yes, the headset does squeeze a little tighter than what you might be used to, but that's because the headband is made of metal and not cheap plastic.  It's the squeeze of quality, learn to love it.  It's not a bad thing at all, you just might not be used to it.  After a few days of breaking it in, I doubt I'll even notice.<br /><br />The sound quality seems fantastic so far.  I'm still working on getting it to sound just right with my game of choice, TF2.  With movies, music, tv shows, etc, it's just amazing.  Crystal clear, rich, amazing sound.<br /><br />I initially had problems with the mic, people in Team Fortress 2 were telling me that it was cutting out, and screwing up sound for everyone (if you've ever played the game, you know what I'm talking about).  This was fixed by turning the mic gain way way down.  I've been so used to mics that are super quiet, so I had windows set to max out and boost mic input, and maxed out mic input through the game as well.  Turned the levels down quite a bit and presto, clear as a bell.<br /><br />One thing I don't like, the mic level resets itself every time I unplug the headset (rather, the usb dongle) then plug it back up.  It remembers every other setting, just not mic gain.  I've solved this by setting one of the G keys to reduce mic gain, so if I ever launch a game and accidentally leave it set too high, I can easily fix it on the fly.<br /><br />Speaking of the G keys, I was kind of disappointed that they work with ventrilo, but not teamspeak.  No big deal though.  Still, I was hoping to be able to sit on my porch and chill in our TS channel and be able to chat with people.  (I have to go outside to smoke here...ahem >.>...you know what I mean.)<br /><br />The wireless range and battery life really seem to be just as good as advertised, which was a very nice surprise.  I can go anywhere in my house and still have completely clear audio.The majority of my front porch gets signal as well, and that's going between three walls.  Last night I went in game with only a partial charge, the software said 7 hours of battery life left.  I played a little over two hours, left game, and it said I still had five hours left.  Good stuff.<br /><br />I love this headset.  Completely.  After years of frustration over broken wires ruining headsets, I could not be happier with this product.  If you've got a nice, functioning headset already, like a g35 or whatever, I couldn't justify telling you to purchase this.  However, if you've got a cheap POS, or if you're in the market to buy a new headset because you rolled over your current pair's wires one too many times with your chair, I couldn't recommend this enough.  I've never spent this much money on one before, I've always been in the 50-70 dollar range.  Dropping 160 wasn't easy for me to do, money is tight these days.  I don't regret the purchase at all.
B003L20IDS|5.0|NOTE: This is just reviewing the theatrical release, not the DVD or Blu-ray.<br /><br />It was with very little fanfare that I went to see Scott Pilgrim vs. the World  on opening night. The ads were never really appealing to me and I felt like Michael Cera was being typecast so I figured this movie would be a flop. Still, there was enough positive buzz that I agreed to come along when a friend wanted to go and I'm floored at how opposite of a reaction I had to this film. Not only is it probably the biggest surprises of my life as far as movies go (not plot-wise, just in my feelings about it), but it's hands down one of the most fun experiences I've ever had in a movie theater.<br /><br />The plot of Scott Pilgrim is pretty much exactly what you'd expect from the trailers: Michael Cera is Scott Pilgrim, who has fallen in love with a very alluring girl who, as it so happens, has 7 evil exes who have banded together to ensure that no one dates her if they can't. You really have to go into the movie accepting that this is the plot because it's not anything deeper than that, and that's a big part of what I love about it. This is one of the few movies I've seen in a long while that understands exactly what it needs to do and really nails it. It focuses on a few things and blows them out of the park. So even though the romance story is never fully fleshed out, it's the first movie I've seen that has felt like a comic book and a video game have come to life, slept together, and produced a child on the big screen.<br /><br />I don't know how true it is to the comic book, but that's irrelevant because it stands on its own as something really smart if you can appreciate the references and things it tries to parody. You don't have to be a gamer or a comic book fan to enjoy the film, you're just guaranteed to love it if you are either. I never thought I'd see a movie that got so many things right about video games - everything from nonsensical fights to collecting coins where it doesn't make sense to a ton of subtle things that are just elegantly done. It's either subtle or obviously over-the-top, it never beats a joke to death. I laughed a lot - from even before the movie formally started - but I also saw very few promotional materials.<br /><br />Aside from those facets, the music is perfect for the movie. I almost felt like it had as much music as a musical without the baggage that would entail. The cast really contributing to pulling off the music though. I believed in them in their roles, as crazy as the world they lived in ended up being. I believed their passion for their music, and that was a cool feeling. The way they weaved music into the storyline was truly clever.<br /><br />I can't leave out how much heart this movie had either. I don't mean gushy have-a-good-cry heart, I just mean that it actually makes you feel good to be a nerd if you're a nerd. It makes you want to go out and jam out on your guitar or play Street Fighter or something - I just felt pumped and enamored with how much the director seemed to love music and video games and comics.<br /><br />Unfortunately, I don't think this is a movie everyone will love. I can't imagine anyone hating it because it just makes you feel so good walking out of it, but I can see parts of it being harder to appreciate without being in your 20s or early 30s. It is somewhat of a niche movie, but I wouldn't be ashamed to show it to anyone (assuming they're at least a teenager). I will say that the writing is weak at times. Even though I did identify somewhat with the romance, it was still at times handled a little strangely. I can see people taking issue with the characters, but I actually liked how non-traditional they were. They weren't people you could totally peg down, but in a good way. One minor gripe I had was that the ending was possibly a little more drawn out than it needed to be, but I didn't really mind that much.<br /><br />This movie is easily an A+ to me, and I urge you to please go and see it. It's only done like $10 million and I think it'll make it up over the course of its run in theaters and on home video, but I feel bad that the makers may not feel the love from the box office that I felt for this movie. I feel silly having had such a strong positive reaction to a romantic comedy action movie that appeals to the 12-year-old inside of me, but I can't lie: I enjoyed this film and can't wait to get it on Blu-ray.and I think it'll make it up over the course of its run in theaters and on home video, but I feel bad that the makers may not feel the love from the box office that I felt for this movie.

0743496728|3.0|I really enjoyed this book as I was reading...I couldn't put it down. But I noticed that what really drew me to it was not only how Picoult made me sympathize for Peter...but also that this story cut to the bone, had so many vivid details...it was almost like I'd heard the story before. Then I realized that I had. Because this story happened in 1999 at Columbine High School. I know that the killer is completely different in his motive and the back story with Josie and Alex and the lawyers and whatnot was fictional...but those were just about the only things in the entire book that weren't taken directly from actual events that happened during or after Columbine.    To name a few:    -The body count was around the same number....with around the same number of people left injured.    -ONE male teacher died from similar injuries despite help from students in both stories.    -Peter had sawed-off shotguns in his bag and Eric and Dylan had at least one of those as well.    -Eric harris went into the library yelling about how he was going to kill the jocks (allegedly) and so did peter in the book except he wasnt in the library when he said that.    -They both set off a bomb outside of the school before they started shooting.    -In the book a kid is shot and loses function of one side of his body. He goes in and out of consciousness numerous times while trying to make it to a window...he gets to the window and the rescue people outside see him and say \\"we're coming to get you!\\" or something to that affect. The kid falls out of the window before the people are ready to catch him. This is almost EXACTLY what happened to Patrick Ireland at Columbine, the only difference being that in the book he falls because he tries to nod and at Columbine Patrick misunderstood what the people trying to catch him were saying. I'm sure everyone who watched the footage remembers the video of him escaping out that window...I was nine and I remember. I cannot believe she used that story in thebook.    -In the book, the mother of a victim goes into a store, asks to see a gun, loads it and shoots herself right there. This exact same incident happened to a mother after the columbine shootings, the only difference being that her daughter survived but was paralyzed.    -Memorial crosses were made for the victims at columbine and someone made two for the killers as well which were repeatedly defaced....also happened in the book ...even tho the killer wasnt dead.    -In the book peter sees a kid he knows before he goes into the school on the day of the shooting and peter tells him to go home. Eric did the same exact thing.    These are just some of the similarities...and there's no way it's a coincidence. After discovering this I'm a little puzzled as to why she even wrote the book. Most of it was already written for her. I could understand maybe having a couple of similarities...but this many is just plain unoriginal. I can't help but feel like it's a little disrespectful. There is no guideline for how a school shooting goes...she could have been completely original. I just don't get it. However, I did enjoy reading the book...Peter is completely different than Eric and Dylan were and that's what makes the book so great. I would still recommend it...just don't expect an original work of fiction.
B002OSXDAU|4.0|The Fountainhead is one of those classics that ever reader needs to include in their library.  Because the Fountainhead is sadly reliant solely on existential philosophy, the real gem in the story - the faithful expression of one's soul, is lost in a relativistic plot.  Never the less, without much effort the reader can find a transcendent sense of self in the story's main character.

1591396190|5.0|Pretty good book with some practical recommendations, tools and process. Easy to get through quickly. There good case studies.
B00007K02F|5.0|This version came out a couple of years ago and was panned by some of the troglodyte critics that I read so I passed it up. I regret that.     Only recently did I find a copy and watch it through. I was astonished!       The performance by Charlotte Gainsbourg as Jane is outstanding. I could not take my eyes from her when she was onscreen.      Rarely have I been so captivated by an actress. Hurt's performance by contrast was was good but routine. Why     do American actors have so much trouble playing Englishmen? The only exception I can think of is Edward    Norton. Perhaps what the British say about us colonials is true.       If you love period piece films, asI do, don't miss this one. It's available from Amazon. com.
B0032Y8XH8|5.0|Great CD!  Great Acoustic guitar and banjo throughout the whole CD.  They also sprinkled in some brass, piano, strings, and various percussion instruments.  The song writing was also done well.  The only thing I would have to say negatively about this album is that the overall feel of each song is very similar and can get repetitive.  If you like Folk, this is a must have album.
B001GSV3EC|5.0|Excellent. Great sound. Great band. Great tunes. Great guitar. If you've not taken him seriously because he is considered a \\"rock\\" guitarist, then you are mistaken. He is splendidly original and makes music that touches your soul.
030726999X|5.0|I really enjoyed this trilogy and thought the 3rd book was a really strong ending to a great series.  No offense to the people who didn't enjoy it...but it's not the authors fault if you are too stupid to follow the plots/characters/settings.  My point is, don't listen to the people that didn't like it, because their inability to understand it seemed to be the common theme for the nay-sayers.<br /><br />My advice, start with the first book.  They are really great characters and plots.  I thoroughly enjoyed this series.  Very intelligent, interesting, and worthy of the read.
0141182865|3.0|Although I am sorry that the author, discouraged that his book had not been published, killed himself, I did not care for the book (and I don't care if it did win a Pulitzer).  I think the author's writing is gifted and believe he could have been good, but the book was too bizarre for me.  The main character simply has no redeeming qualities whatsoever (but then neither does any other character in the book).  Ignatius goes from one impossibly stupid situation to the next, spouting his nearly psychotic rhetoric.  It is funny at first, but it just gets old after a while.  I'm not sure what the point of the book was.  The author was not very pleased with people, apparently.
B0015DROBO|5.0|This is a great book.  I hesitated many months to purchase this book for my Kindle.  I heard some friends saying these books are great, so I decided to try it.  It was a little slow at first and then it came alive.  I am glued every chance I get to read it.  I can't wait to read the other two books that follow.  Happy Reading.  :) Oh, and I cannot wait to see the movie, which is in the making as I am reading this book.

B003Y5H4RK|4.0|Centurion is your formulaic hack and slash movie, but Michael Fassbender (he played the British leftenant in Quentin Tarantino's Inglorious Basterds) steals the show here.  The movie is set in Britain during Roman rule and just prior to the construction of Hadrian's Wall.  Pict tribes and barbarians are constantly skirmishing with Roman troops, raiding border towns and attacking forts.  Neil Marshall explores a fictitious version of events to explain the disappearance and demise of Legio IX Hispana.  While the real 9th legion may have suffered a defeat by Boudica, queen of the Iceni, we're treated to an interesting version wherein the entire legion (led in a brief appearance by Dominic West) is decimated while fighting the Picts, leaving a few lone survivors who band together to fight guerrilla style in order to maintain their survival.    It is here that Fassbender shines; he is charismatic as the de facto leader of the surviving band of Roman soldiers cum guerrillas.  Liam Cunningham is one of the other recognizable actors in the band of soldiers, and he plays the usual gruff veteran soldier, just as he did in Clash of the Titans.  The rest of the soldiers are largely unknowns, well, at least to this American viewer.  Imogen Poots (28 Weeks Later) makes an interesting appearance as a witch, and the witch storyline feels strangely out of place in the movie.  The witch is more of an afterthought in an effort to provide some romantic interest to Fassbender.  The plot is predictable, but the movie is a guilty pleasure.  I'm surprised they were able to equip as many Roman soldier extras as they did in lorica segmentata.  Too bad the pila are used incorrectly; it seems Hollywood (I'm looking at you too Gladiator) never gets it right.    For those of you concerned about violence, yes, this movie shows Roman-style warfare in all its brutal, gladius glory.  CG blood abounds, heads are bashed, limbs detached, and abdomens disemboweled.  One scene with a deer's intestines strangely reminded me of the tauntaun scene from Empire Strikes Back.    Overall, an impressive job for just a $10 million budget.
B0002Y4T92|5.0|Eric Clapton is one of the greatest guitar players in the world.  His interaction with all the other greats, i.e., B B King, James Taylor, Vince Gill, etc. was so natural and unassuming.  I would recommend this 2-DVD set to anyone who loves jazz, or any other kind of guitar music.  It has inspired me to start playing again after a year's 'dead' period.
0307473708|4.0|I don't know why people are reviewing this book so low. It's a really great read. If you've watched the show then you will know what's going to happen mostly through out the whole book. I found myself trying to imagine what part of the show that the author was explaining. The only big difference is towards the end of the book and I'm not going to spoil it for anyone. Overall it's a really good book to read as well as a great series to follow.
B002ZG9918|3.0|Being a big fan of the other two Step Up movies, I was so excited when I saw that this was coming out.  While the first movie had a solid plot line and the second one had not as much of a solid plot line (but it was still there and it still made sense), this movie left me wanting more out of the plot.  The characters were not well developed, there was a hint of a plot line, but it still could've been better.<br /><br />The plot?  A young man (Adam Sevani of \\"Step Up 2) and a young girl (Alyson Stoner of \\"Step Up\\") are going to college at NYU and Sevani meets up with this man making a film (Rick Malambri) about street dancing and Malambri sees that Sevani is really good, so he is recruited to dance at the World Jam.  Oh, and there's this other girl Natalie (Sharni Vinson) who shows up, too, and has a little bit of a secret that is revealed about halfway through the movie, removing that plot suspense.<br /><br />What was left out of the plot and character development for me, was made up with the dancing and music.  I know a few people go and see these movies just because of the dancing, but if I go see a movie, when they aren't dancing, I don't want to be bored and I don't want to be able to make several bathroom trips because I know that I won't be missing anything while I'm gone.<br /><br />I still enjoyed the movie, but I am personally getting tired of all of the 3D movies.  Some of the movies are great with it (Toy Story 3, for example, and Avatar), but this one could've done without it because their 3D effects were reminding me of those horrible 3D movies from the 1950s, where they're all in your face.  There were scenes in this movie where I know that if it was not a 3D movie, those scenes would not have been in there.  For example (and this isn't giving anything away because you can see the majority of these in the trailer), there is one part where they randomly go up on the top of this roof and stand on an air vent and drop straw-fulls of slushee in the air between them, making the slushee fly up in the audience's face.  At one dance-off, they were constantly blowing dust toward the audience, or they were dancing with their arms reaching right toward the camera, making it seem like they were about to hit you in the face.<br /><br />Those scenes are great if you are on the Terminator ride at Universal, but it's not something I want to see in a movie.<br /><br />But, as I said before, what was lacking with the plot line, characters, and sometimes the cheesy acting, was made up for with the phenomenal dancing.lushee fly up in the audience's face.

B001TH16DI|1.0|I bought this Blue Ray set in great anticipation of the higher definition. The Blue Ray concept is a nice improvement over standard DVD. However, Blue Ray is implemented differently than standard DVD in many ways and differently on each Blue Ray disc. For example, DVD function is left more to the Java Software on the disc rather than the player itself. This allows the manufacturer to maintain greater control over player function.     Now for the problem here. The discs in this set do not implement certain standard disc/player functions like stop and remember position. In other words, if you stop any of these discs and restart, you will be returned to the beginning of the disc, which entails going through the FBI warnings and previews again. You will then need to use the scene function to find your previous position to continue watching the movie where you left off.     If you pause the disc, it will continue where you left off unless the player auto shuts off in 30 minutes and then it is considered a stop function, which requires complete restart of the discs again.    This is not true of all Blue Rays. The Terminator Sarah Conner Chronicles, for example, works correctly, but not this Star Trek Set. It can be very annoying and detract from the movie experience. Personally, I plan to resell this set and return to my standard DVD collection. The difference in resolution just isn't worth the frustration caused by bad software design. Incidentally, Blue ray uses Java; the now defunct HD used a Microsoft software system.
B000QCS8TW|2.0|I was so looking forward to reading this series.  I just started reading fantasy novels after 30 years of reading nothing but technical and business publications.  George Martin was highly recommended.  So I purchased the first book, \\"A Game of Thrones\\", and read it.  Wow, it was like watching the movie \\"Titanic\\".  To many that was a movie worth watching.  If you didn't like \\"Titanic\\" then you'll know what I mean about this book, and series.  It takes forever to say anything.  He could have cut down the book from 1,100 to 400 pages and saved us a lot of drudgery.<br /><br />I liked the story but he has too many characters in it and nothing ever seems to resolve itself; except people are dropping like flies!  Many would say this is an epic, but I say let's get on with it.<br /><br />So, I read the second book...same problem...read the third book...same problem.  Since he hasn't resolved anything important, or at least I'm interested in, I stopped reading and started reading other books with some action and closure (and did I ever find some).<br /><br />This may be your cup of tea but it certainly wasn't mine.
B002HK9IDQ|5.0|I love every Audrey Hepburn movie I watch. This is probably one of my favorites. The music is fun, the costumes are fun, the story is fun, the accents are funny. Love this movie!!
B000HC2LI0|2.0|I love the West Wing, and so does my girlfriend. I bought her a \\"just because\\" gift of the entire collection, and thought that if I could get a \\"like new\\" version, it would be fine to get it used, since we're both committed to saving money.     Bad plan.     We're on Season 4, and 2 of the discs so far (that's 10% by the way) are unreadable on several different machines. Seriously disappointing.

B002LBGBR2|5.0|[[ASIN:B002LBGBR2 I Am...Sasha Fierce (Platinum Edition) (Incl. Bonus Tracks and Music Videos)]]  So by now everyone should know who Beyonce is and what she has done to the music business well she has changed it and  in a good way. \\"I Am... Sasha Fierce\\" was released in '08 at the time only 2 versions of the album were available there was a standard and deluxe, I bought the deluxe because it was the best choice with 16 tracks and it was the better value but when I hear about a platinum edition I was a bit upset because Beyonce loves to RE-RELEASE her work some people hate it I dont really mind unless you only release the same album with a remix then im pissed. But the platinum edition was the version of the album that should have been released first it is the best version of the album, the track-listing makes the album feel fresh and new and the 4 bonus tracks makes the album complete the best bonus in my opinion is the Billy Joel cover \\"Honesty\\" it is so beautiful and you feel sincere emotion. The new version also come with 7 videos( In america you most likely already have the video collection but this version comes with Sweet Dreams) all in all if you love B and you want something to kill your anxiousness for her next record buy this if your a casual fan dont buy this because you would think I already have this and if you are a new fan buy this because it best version of IASF so your pick all in all great job Beyonce. 4.5/5
B003IEJZUG|5.0|This book seemed as if it would be simple and possiby juvenile.  I couldn't have been more wrong.  It was complex, very moving, enjoyable, and surprisingly believable.

B003JTHETY|4.0|When the Wild Wind Blows is an instant classic.  This song alone makes the 4 year wait worth it.  El DOrado is good.  Final Frontier will be a classic Maiden song for years to come.  It's got the catchy chorus and clear/interesting lyrics.  Don't care too much for the first part of the song Satellite 15.  Kind of goes on too long for an intro.  Coming home is my second favorite song on the album.  Lots of great stuff in this song.  Bruce's voice shines on this one.  Starblind is average at best as is Isle of Avalon.    The rest is \\"meh\\" for me right now.  This has been the case with all recent Iron Maiden albums for me though.  After months of listening to them the ones I disliked before become some of my favorites.  A matter of life death is a good example.  When it came out I thought it was freakin awesome all the way up to the last 2 songs Lord of light and legacy.  I didn't think they fit with the album and just didn't like them.  Well, they are my favorites from that album now.  I think some Maiden you just have to listen until it clicks with you.  They are advancing their sound/brand every album and it takes time to catch up to their congwriting prowess.    I've tried to force myself to like Talisman, but other than the chorus I can't find any redeeming qualities about it. I really dislike the way Bruce sinces along with the guitar notes instead of over or thru them.  Just seems to ramble to me.      Absolutely worth the purchase price though and a must have addition to the Maiden collection.  I may look back 6 months from now and wonder what was I thinking for giving it only 4 stars, but here it is.  My .02.  Up The Irons!  And tot eh first reviewer that shredded it apart, I think you're Paul Dianno.  Maiden isn't Maiden without Bruce.  Nuff said.
B000002J6F|5.0|I always liked Stephen Stills and when I bought the Manassas album when it first came out I didn't know what to expect. From beginning to end this album blew me away and quickly became one of my favorites. When it came out on CD I snatched that up as well. I still listen to it today and other Stephen Stills fans who have not heard this album just shake their heads and wonder why they hadn't checked it out years ago.
B00165KRQU|5.0|Prepare to be swept away to the 80's again.  This is an excellent collection of Duran Duran hits.
0385341008|5.0|This was such an interesting book and I wished I could keep right on reading through the rest of the main character's life.  I enjoyed it so much and would definitely recommend it to anyone.
006621131X|3.0|Certainly an interesting set of circumstances for a book. This volume, however, reads like a somewhat breathless, and very long, magazine article. I was able to read over 140 pages in one night with very little effort. That says something about this book. It is also *very* badly edited and full of glaring historical mistakes. I'm guessing Ms. Smith made these errors herself and her editors are just clueless. This is hilarious coming from an author who talks about Washington Square Park being haunted by the spirit of Henry James.
B002ZG99A4|5.0|This is the ultimate guy movie. It has all the big action superstars in it and they all deliver an amazing action movie. Stallone has shown that he really knows how to direct a good action movie and this is definitely the best. There's no love scenes, there's no comic releif, there's just face pounding action from start to finish. I don't know how anybody could ever possibly watch this movie expecting anything but in your face violence and action. Those people will be disappointed if they exist (which by some of these reviews dissing the plot and story they obviously did manage to expect this to be some kind of not-action movie). These are probably people who went to see Titanic expecting loads of action and gore. I don't know how anyone could see the poster for this movie and expect it to be some kind of shakespearean masterpiece with no violence and dramatic, tear-jerking love scenes, but apparently those geniuses exist, and they're giving this movie bad reviews. Anyone who likes action movies, will be pleased with the amount of action in this movie. Action-packed I believe is the correct term to use here. There is enough testosterone in this movie to kill a bull.
006097625X|5.0|i bought this book for my boyfriend who writes and illustrates graphic novels. he LOVES this book! apparently i am the \\"best girlfriend ever\\" for getting this book for him. he said McCloud explains so many interesting ways of writing/interpreting comics that it has inspired him to write a new comic.<br /><br />so, yes! it's as good as everyone says it is!
B002ZG977Y|3.0|Alright...I love this movie. Honestly,I do..but here's my problem.  Perseus was made to look like a total punk.  I mean,he whined a lot and almost everyone did the fighting for him.  The only reason he's a hero is the few bits that he did come out ahead (ex. when he got the eye from the witches,killed Medusa).  Other then that,he didn't do much for me as far as mythic heroes go.  I thought Sam Worthington was great but I wish he had more of a story as Perseus.  That's really my only big problem.  Oh...and what's with that creeper in the Toga and funky hair?  That dude was creepy as all hell and a total zealot...just pure psycho.  Other then that,I loved this movie...it's definitely one to see,I just wish there was a lot more story and epic moments to it.
B002KVSJ7S|2.0|Big disappointment for me after his prior album.  He has an amazing voice, but the songs on this CD do not compare to his prior work in the Life in Cartoon Motion CD.

B001OQCV2O|1.0|One of the worst movies I've ever seen.  I gave it one star because I'm not allowed to give it zero stars.  Plot - ridiculous.  Character development - non-existent.  Science - completely absent.  John Cusack is just wasted due to the lousy script.  It's nothing but a sequence of chase scenes with highly improbable escapes that are so out there that they aren't even fun.  Within a few minutes, you don't even care if anyone survives.  I kept watching, waiting for it to get better. It just got worse. CGI effects were OK.  I'd rather watch \\"Plan 9 From Outerspace\\" any day instead.  I want those 3 hours back with interest added on.
B003JTHESA|5.0|After 2 so so records in Dance of Death & Matter of Life & Death, which don't get me wrong are good records, but there is a certain flow Maiden records need to follow. On DOD, Steve Harris wrote majority of the songs & while they are good some could have been shorter. On AMOL&D, the problem with that one is they didn't clean up Bruce's vocals they just recorded what seemed like his 1st take & the production was lacking in places.    But now to their new offering The Final Frontier! This album could have easily come after 7th Son of a 7th Son. It sounds like they took Piece of Mind, Somewhere in Time, 7th Son & Brave New World, put them in a big cauldron, stirred it up & when they poured it out, out came The Final Frontier. Adrian Smith is ALL OVER this album & any Maiden fan who is worth their salt will agree he has written some of their Classics (ex: Heaven Can Wait, Can I Play With Madness, etc...)     Bruce has an elder statesman quality to his vocals on this disc as well. Instead of forcing his high range as he did in my opinion on Dance of Death & A Matter of Life & Death, he uses it only when the song needs the extra push over the edge. As a band they have finally mastered what it takes to have a 3 axe attack. The baby steps they took with having 3 axes on Brave New World are gone! They are full fledged \\"MEN OF SONIC SOUND\\" on this one. Janick, Dave & Adrian mesh perfectly on every song. I won't review every song, but they are as long as they need to be, when you listen the time goes by quicker than you think. The trademark MAIDEN GALLOP is in the mix as well.    It is great to see a classic metal band like Iron Maiden be able to put out a high quality product. The production is crisp, it's not loud or clipping in any way, unlike some recent releases by many different bands within many genres. Kevin Shirley didn't brickwall the sound. To all who are unsure i will leave this tidbit it's 80's Iron Maiden in the new millenium. You will not be disappointed! BUY THIS RECORD!!!!

0670021652|3.0|I'm perplexed by the number of reviewers who found this book to be disappointing because they didn't realize what it was about. A quick read of the back cover or the first few pages would have been a good indication. Ms. Gilbert clearly lays out her agenda and outline for this book: it is NOT a sappy, entertaining, Nicholas Sparks type novel, nor did she intend for it to be. This book wasn't written for our entertainment; it was written for her. I really enjoyed this book, and think it's a good follow-on to EPL. I'm glad Elizabeth Gilbert isn't a one dimensional writer; I prefer an author with a little depth. The ONLY criticism I have for it (and this is more for the editor she praises so highly) is the overwhelming use of the word \\"moreover\\". A great read.
0446563048|4.0|This is an excellent, easy to read book on the underlying principles for building a successful modern business. Zappos is a web retail business selling shoes, clothes and such. It's now about 10 years old, has exceeded $1 Billion in sales revenue and Amazon bought it in 2009.<br /><br />Tony Hsieh, the author, is the CEO.<br /><br />Zappos has been built around 3 key areas:<br /><br />1. Customer service,<br />2. Culture, and<br />3. Employee development<br /><br />As Tony writes, everything else can be replicated but if you have committed employees, passionately serving customers and constantly developing themselves, you have a competitive advantage in your market.<br /><br />The book is full of passion, full of great ideas and some good stories. It's naturally autobiographical as Tony shares his life over the past 15 or so years. We get to read about the Amazon deal, a detailed outline of the company's 10 Core Values and testimonials from employees, customers and suppliers on how the company lives out these values.<br /><br />It will be fascinating to watch how Zappos develops and whether it will become another Virgin, in taking it's 3 core elements across different industries. I love the fact Tony states that the telephone is probably the best customer service tool, and this coming from a web-based business. In an era when so many businesses have tried to reduce call activity pushing as much onto the web, it's a testament to Zappos that they acknowledge sometimes the best way of delighting a customer is by talking to them. People never forget how you make them feel - WOWed customers will visit again and buy more.<br /><br />I'm still finding a reason to visit the site and purchase something so I can test the experience.<br /><br />I expect this and potential future sequels will become mandatory reading in all top quality management development programs at business schools. I anticipate people in future will quote the Zappos experience in the same breath as we do Jim Collins \\"Good to Great\\".<br /><br />I passionately recommend it.

0307594777|4.0|The books were about the girl and were riviting.  The second book seemed a bit puzzling until you read the third one and then it all came together nicely.  (I suspect the second and third books were really part 1 and part 2 of one book.)  I never realized people drank so much coffee or ate pickles with so many food choices.  It was an interesting insite to life in Scandinavia and how different government can be.  I guess the S&M was needed for the story line but I found that part particulary dull and pushed through it quickly.  All in all it was one of the most intersting reads so far this year.  I highly recomend you see it before see the movie currently out.  The girl is one of the most vibrant examples of a modern day heroine with all the bent social skills of todays youngsters.  Her character is fascinating and when the books were about her, I settled deeper into my chair with a sigh of satisfaction.
B001DJ7PR8|1.0|if you have a choice, do not buy this. if you own it. do not watch it.  it is the story of two very silly young girls on vacation in barcelona, and older man who just wants sex with anything that moves and looks female, and his crazy exwife. the man and wife are painters, so called, and the examples of their work will clearly make you understand why she is crazy and he is sexually obsessed.   the funniest part is meeting with his father, who will speak no other language than spanish, though catalan is the tongue of barcelona, he is a poet and he believes his poems are only to be written in spanish, but he refuses to publish them because he is angry at the world and this is his way of punishing it. bad poet , bad poems, nutty character. that pretty much describes the story.
B00004TL21|5.0|The Deftones were always a band that started off as a typical \\"modern metal\\" (I hate the term nu-metal!!) with bands like 'korn' and such as thier peers, yet unlike the other bands Deftones have surpassed their peers with each album. 'White Pony' is perhaphs this bands greatest achievement, it combined the elements of soft vs heavy perfectly, it turned this band into superstars, and for good reason.  The deftones have never been 'mainstream' but they made an album that was very accessable to everyone, not just fans of metal.  I will do a track by track review of this classic record.    1. Feiticeira: A great way to start the album, soaring vocals, loud guitars, pummeling drums. Awesome song. 10/10    2. Digital Bath: One of the best deftones songs written, such a moody song, filled with such emotion..amazing 10/10    3. Elite: This song is very very heavy, chinos screaming really pierce the ear drums on this one, I especially like the alternate vocals that chino does (kinda robot sounding), very cool 9/10    4. Rx Queen: Wow, such a unique song with a hypnotic drum beat, and a killer hook. Very moody and very catchy. On eof my favorites 10/10    5. Street Carp: A very cool song with some heavy riffs/drums.. unique chorus as well here. 9/10    6. Teenager: What a unique song! almost trip-hop sounding, VERY moody, a personal favorite. 10/10    7. Knife Prty: Such a good song...very catchy and heavy..awesome track with very cool lyrics 10/10    8. Korea: If im no mistaken, this song was originally called \\"white pony\\", a very heavy song with very good lyrics, strippers and cocaine...what else do u need in life? 10/10    9. Passenger: A classic! Chino AND Maynard on one song, can't get much better than that...awesome song 10/10    10. Change (in the house of flies): The popular single from the album, a standout track, very moody and heavy. I really like Frank Delgados contribution to this song, the keyboards/samples are spot on perfect for this track. Awesome vocals as well. 10/10    11. Pink Maggit: A great way to end this 'concept album', this track would later be re-written into the single \\"back to school (mini maggit)\\", a great track on its own, but this original track really set the mood and is a 7 min epic song that closes this pinnacle album.    This album really defined rock/metal/alternative music in the 2000's, it really set the bar (very high infact) for bands to create timeless music that left lasting impressions with fans, not just go for #1 hits.
0743243153|5.0|A well known lawyer highly recommended this book in his classroom. I could not be more pleased with its content.Arguments relevant to my life are easily identifiable. The author's definition of Psychotherapy alone cleared up my misunderstanding of the field. Dr. Peck also clears up the correlation between religion and Psychotherapy. The importance of love in everyday life is highlighted especially as it relates to spiritual growth.
0440246164|5.0|I read them all when I can find them.  This one is no exception
0670021652|3.0|Granted, I still have about 70 more pages to go before I'm done with this, but I'm already fixing to write the antidote to this book and call it \\"Devoted: Having it all and loving every bit of it.\\" How can a woman with one failed marriage and no children have any sort of realistic opinion of marriage in a positive light? Just because we opt to get married and have children doesn't automatically mean we are shortchanging ourselves as women if we consciously make that choice for whatever reason. In this day and age, YES, it IS possible to have a husband for life, children, and a fulfilling career. It requires saying \\"yes!,\\" taking risks, and most of all, LOVE. Any negatives can be chalked up to the investments we all make in that great adventure we call LIFE. For God's sake, stop the ranting, just jump in and LIVE!! There's more to life than \\"your\\" work. When we die, it's who and what we leave behind that counts. Would you rather give the Universe your descendants or a couple of has-been best sellers collecting dust?
031606792X|5.0|I just started reading this and it is really great.  Can't hardly put it down.  Highly recommended.
0307346617|5.0|Fantastic effort from Max Brooks. I really liked the style of narrative -- Brooks strings together multiple individual experiences into a coherent, interesting story.
B002ZG9846|4.0|This movie was a lot more than I expected!! I usually gauge a movie by whether I fall asleep before the end of the movie, so the simple fact I watched it until the very end speaks volumes! Good action, plot and cinematography makes this a must see. A little violent for younger kids, but teenagers will enjoy.
B003OFHMKO|5.0|I hope the reviewing sessions of the National Academy of Recording Arts and Sciences of the United States get the opportunity to have this outstanding release on the itinerary, since at least one Grammy Award - if not more - will be easily penciled into the 2011 show.<br /><br />With sensational jazz and classic pop sensibilities, Esperanza Spalding delivers an impressive 11 tracks that have world music sounds and a flair for the era of flappers and philosophers. The central piece - which just happens to be track six - is the touching \\"Apple Blossom,\\" a vocal duet featuring Spalding (who is also the composer/arranger) and Milton Nascimento. The short \\"As a Sprout\\" glides into \\"What a Friend,\\" which has Spalding's best work on acoustic bass. Her smooth vocals and bass playing on \\"Winter Sun\\" and sweet vocals on \\"Inutil Paisagem\\" make for an irresistible twin bill.<br /><br />Spalding's arrangement of \\"Wild is the Wind\\" has crossover appeal and she makes interesting use of poet William Blake's \\"The Fly\\" in \\"Little Fly,\\" which is the first number. The string arrangements by Spalding and Gil Goldstein (they are album co-producers) add touching textures to \\"Knowledge of Good and Evil,\\" \\"Really Very Small\\" and \\"Chacarera.\\" The warmth in the performance of \\"Short and Sweet\\" is a solid way to conclude the album.<br /><br />This is her third release as a solo artist and second for the Cleveland, Ohio-based Heads Up International, a division of Concord Music Group, Inc. At age 25, the compass for her career is pointing to a path that has limitless potential.
B003O7I6L6|3.0|Hi folks,    I love this 5 star movie....make no mistake, its an all  time favorite. I was thrilled to get the 2 disc edition with bonus opening, commentary, making of and more...but imagine my surprise when I find that this new Blu RAY is bare bones!!!  Maybe it has something to do with Fox taking over the MGM catalog? I don't know..but I'm tired of these bare bones Blu Rays which make keeping  older DVD versions mandatory for  fans... just a rip off.    I obviously bought the Blu Ray...maybe hoping the description was wrong and there would be the bonus content or maybe because I'm a mark for this film...but either way it arrived...sure it looks a wee bit better than the deluxe edition...but zip bonus features..unless a bare bones DVD with a full frame option excites you?
B002RWKSII|5.0|Brian Wilson may have finally met his musical match -- not just in Gershwin, but his band.  It's a great dynamic and you can tell that Brian Wilson owes a great deal of his creative renaissance to his supporting musicians.  With his accomplishments, he could have simply \\"phoned in\\" this album and his fans would be grateful, but you can tell that a lot of love and hard work went into it.<br /><br />The \\"Rhapsody In Blue\\" vocal arrangement reminded me of \\"Our Prayer/Gee.\\"  The comparisons ended there.  Yes, there's definitely a STRONG \\"Beach Boys/Brian Wilson\\" flavor to the whole affair, but that's pretty much the point, isn't it?<br /><br />I'd like to credit the production team with doing a great job recording Brian Wilson's voice, as well as Brian Wilson.  He sounds older and wiser, but over his last few releases, he seems to have learned how to use his older and deeper voice better (with Smile, he was obviously singing songs that he intended for his younger self to sing with his brothers).  Even the promo photo shows an older and wiser Brian Wilson, with grayer hair and wearing a (gasp!) suit -- thankfully no tie -- he's still too young at heart for that.<br /><br />Anyway, this year was a tough year for the music world with the death of the likes of Alex Chilton.  The next generation of musicians still needs to learn more from the masters and living legends.  Thankfully, Brian Wilson is still making beautiful and inspired music.
0393316041|3.0|Don't pay any attention to that negative review by \\"Zorba\\", whose knowledge of post-war bar culture is probably limited.  And his appraisal of Feynman's practical jokes being hurtful must be based on something other than this book.  Feynman has some funny stories and provides us with some biographical data along the way to give the stories a setting.  We hear about his childhood and his first job, along with his early fascination with gadgets and inventions.  Not much in the way of specific details on his work in physics, as has been provided in other biographies, and the \\"Feynman diagrams, which show the arrows of light and time, are mentioned not-a-once, nor is it detailed exactly what he won the nobel prize for, though his headaches of receiving the prize are amuzing.  Don't look for physics, but for the social life of a physicist who also happened to be a character.  He does talk about physics and math and education in a general way and offers up some general observations about how people approach these subjects. There are stories from Los Alamos to Brazil and Japan and from CalTech and Princeton.  A fun short read, if that's what you're looking for.
B003JTHESA|4.0|Being a Maiden fan for some time now, I was excited to know that they were releasing a new album this year after the last great album. Instead, I was sorta disappointed during the first listen. There just seemed to be something amiss this time around. Luckily though after three listens I truly enjoyed this album.<br />Espcially the guitar solos that remind me of the eighties Maiden. I will agree with some reviews stating two main problems with this disc.The first being that the second half of this album is a little repetitve because of length. The second is probably that there seems to be something wrong with Bruce's voice this time around, kinda like he's out of breath and not giving it his all like most fans are familiar with. Overall though I was happy with this release even if it's not the bands srongest it's still the Maiden I love.<br /><br />Standout tracks for me:<br />El Dorado<br />Coming Home<br />The Alchemist<br />Isle of Avalon<br />Starblind<br /><br />P.S.-Please ignore the one star reviews from the so called \\"fans\\" who have no idea what letting the album grow on you before reviewing it means, it will save you from there utter idiocy and your time.
B0034G4OWW|4.0|First, I have to say that buying the Bluray is the best option. One side of the DVD is Bluray and the other is a normal DVD so you can play it on both systems! Throw it into your Xbox, PS3, play it in your laptop while traveling or into a Bluray player!<br />The additional features where pretty good. Very entertaining and the gag reel had me laughing so much I watched it mutliple times. Brooke Shields making Turkey noises and just letting herself be the silly one was a funny thing to see. Everyone knows Brendan Fraser can do action OR comedy equally well but Brooke will have you laughing as well.<br />I had no problems with the toilet humor. It was fun for everyone.<br />I'm sorry to say, I don't believe it comes with a digital copy on either side. This is why I am giving it 4 stars.
B003CFBQBW|4.0|I like this soundtrack. And like many others, I didn't get it because I'm a rabid Twilight fan. I just like soundtracks and I happen to enjoy the previous ones as well.     But I rarely review music CD's, because music taste is so personal, there's no good or bad. Just because I like it won't mean you will.     I like unconventional music. Not because it's \\"in\\" to like relatively lesser known bands, but because I just do. I like \\"hybrid\\" for example, but I am not a fan of the much better known \\"Muse\\". Their song on this CD is merely okay, to me. Vampire Weekend left me indifferent as well.    However I loved \\"Heavy in your Arms\\" , \\"Let's get Lost\\" and \\"Million miles an hour\\". I could go on and describe those songs as I see fit, but I don't think I will be able to them any justice with my writing skills. Sometimes, you just need to listen to a couple of samples (or see the movie) and decide for yourself if this is something for you.    I can tell you it is varied, a bit dark at times, light at others. Most of the songs aren't \\"hit material\\" of the kind you see on MTV.     'Great. Can you get any more vague than that?' you're wondering. 'What is this review worth to me?'      My answer: nothing. Music is not reviewable unless it's describable. And it's not. What one calls \\"dull\\" is \\"haunting\\" for someone else. So try before you buy.
0385512058|5.0|There are two kinds of people. Those who DO and every body else. Keith is a doer and he put in a lot of work to make this book the ultimate Relationship Building tool. An absolute great \\"here's how to do\\" and \\"why to do\\" advise. You can't miss even if you only implement 10% of what he tells you to do. This book changed my life for the better. Thank you Keith wherever you are.
B001TK80BQ|3.0|It is not 1.33:1 aspect ratio like it says. It's the regular 2.35:1 version.    Just FYI.    I really wanted a full screen version of this movie but I guess it's not available :(    Otherwise it is \\"The Matrix\\" and it rocks!
B002ZG980U|5.0|This movie kind of reminded me of Dark City, which I also loved.  The idea that someone can create a world and alter it is very interesting to me.<br /><br />The movie was very well written and I was entertained throughout the entire movie.  All of the actors did an awesome job.  There were a lot of suspenseful and emotionally dramatic moments.<br /><br />The ending left things ambiguous.  We are left hanging for no reason.  The movie was perfectly wrapped up and it could've just ended. Otherwise, it was awesome and I highly recommend.
B000P0J0AQ|3.0|It is the regular 2.35:1 movie. I don't know why it was listed as 1.66:1    I really wanted a version of the movie that would fill up my screen :(    Otherwise it's \\"The Matrix\\" and you can't go wrong with this movie.
B000OONTFU|5.0|I did a quick search on Amazon out of curiosity for HD DVD formats. I found a huge list of items for pennies. Even though this format lost the war with Blue Ray, anyone that still owns a HD DVD player can get great deals if they don't mind owning these titles. Only draw back would be if your player broke, then you're SOL. However, for pennies it costs for these it may just be worth the risk. This DVD was originally somewhere around $150. I got it for 13 cents + shipping/handling and the quality is amazing.
B001H68K4E|5.0|So much extra depth and detail on the SHM it's like a newer, better, version of the original. If you like the album, buy it, if you're a fan, it's a must have.
B002BWQ6H6|1.0|...otherwise more precious time would have been wasted on this book.  Whoever told you to read this is only attempting to return the favor in some kind of satanic \\"pay it forward\\" scheme that answers only to the misery loves company mantra.  The only other possible explanation is that all positive reviewers here and elsewhere lead such miserable or mundane lives in their chosen metropoli that reading this book improves their self esteem.
B000FBFN0Q|4.0|I started this because of the huge number of 5 star ratings and because I needed a rest after reading Gary Ponzo's \\"A Touch of Deceit\\"! This is the CUTEST book, and you keep wondering how long she can shop, evade, and lie through life. We keep yelling at her to grow up. Turns out she's a lot smarter than even she knew, and that's a relief. Very funny, and I wonder if she got paid for all those product placements! A breezy, fast read. Those who didn't like it must have taken it far too seriously.
B003102JDM|2.0|Avoid this movie. It's the forgettable story of Larry Gopnik (Michael Stuhlbarg), a physics professor. It's meticulously set in 1967, for reasons made (somewhat) clear in the film.     Gopnik suffers a series of humiliations. His wife betrays him. Her lover mocks him. His lazy leech of a brother burdens him. A failing student tries to bribe him, and rudely confronts him when he rejects the bribe. His teenage children barely notice  when he gets kicked out of his house and moves to a cheap motel. Three rabbis do not offer him the solace that he desperately seeks. In fact, one of the rabbis confuses him by telling an absurd story that eats up a big chunk of the film. And the above list probably only covers about half of Gopnik's woes.    I don't blame the actors. They did their best with a very weak story, and some of the performances, including Stuhlbarg's, were impressive. Hence the two stars.    I have seen and thoroughly enjoyed five other Coen brothers films, so I know how talented they are. But they just do not deliver with this one.     Perhaps their goal here is to show us that life is unfair and that bad things happen to good, honest, and, yes, \\"serious\\" people. Bad things also happen to people like Gopnik, who, if you think about it, isn't really all that \\"good.\\" The big problem is we knew all of this before we hit the play button. And the theme of good people suffering has been presented far more effectively elsewhere. Some reviewers have mentioned the Book of Job.
B003JTHESA|3.0|When I first heard The Final Frontier and saw the video on Iron Maiden's website, I became overly excited thinking this was going to be the best Iron Maiden CD in a while.  Let me just throw this out quick by saying this is my opinion.  I want to make sure people understand, especially ORWarrior, that this is not a troll post.  Just because this music does not suit \\"MY\\" taste, it does not mean it is horrid garbage for everyone else, this one just wasn't for me.  I've given it several listens and each time I find the same thing.  After several complete listens, I now find myself getting more and more bored with the slower intro style songs, and personally, I think there are too many of them on here, or maybe it's just that so many of the songs take so long to really get going that I lose interest.  I think Seventh Son had a nice entry with Infinite Dreams, but the entire disc didn't have the same feel.  So I don't hate all their slower stuff, but they can definitely keep stuff like Wasting Love and Journeyman.  I know Maiden does great epics, and I'm not looking for the days of the old.  I know what I like about Maiden and it's usually faster material.    My first gripe with the songs is the 4+ minute droaning on of Satellite 15.  Really guys?  4 minutes of almost the same thing?  I find myself fast fowarding to about 3 minutes and then resuming.  After that, I love it, great opener.  It gave me goosebumps that I haven't felt since the first time I heard Wicker Man. (which I absolutely love!)  It's after that where I become disappointed with the rest of this disc.  While I love the songs that open like Fear of the Dark and Hallowed Be Thy Name, I didn't care for the way they did it with the songs on here.  I understand they tried something different, It just didn't strike the right chord for me.    The songs I did like - The Final Frontier (minus the 4 minute start)  El Dorado (I like this song, but 3 minutes into it, when the main chorus hits, I find that I lose a little bit of interest, I think it's because, in my mind anyway, it just doesn't flow naturally)  Maybe I'm weird...  Starblind    I found songs like Mother of Mercy and The Alchemist to be just kinda...so-so.  While by rights I should like the Alchemist as I usually dig faster paced Maiden, I had a hard time really liking this one.    I really wanted to like Isle of Avalon, but there is just something with the way Bruce sings and the way the guitars are that I don't care for.  Again, I really hate how long the opening goes before it gets into a heavier faster part of the song.    Not a fan of When the Wild Wind Blows, The Talisman, (Bruce's voice kinda annoys me on that one) Coming home, and The Man Who Would Be King.    After looking at the above, I think a major annoyance is that so many of the songs seem to take a few minutes to really get going.  While I like it on some of their songs, I don't want it on the majority of the disc.    I'm going to keep listening and hope that it grows on me, but it just doesn't make me excited like BNW did, and I think that is the BIGGEST reason I am so disappointed.  I had my expectations set to a certain standard after seeing the video for The Final Frontier, and the disc didn't live up to it.  :(    Again, take this for what it's worth.  More power to those who like it.  I hate the majority of Rap music but that doesn't mean everyone should.  Same thing goes for Iron Maiden's latest.
0743454537|5.0|The book came quickly and in good repair.    I don't think I love Jodi Picoult's style of writing.  The books are entertaining enough but they seem to have about three hundred paged in the middle that drag on in repetitive information that doesn't really effect the plot and climax of the story.  I don't think I'll be reading any more of her books until I have read all the other hundreds of books on my list.
B0024FAG5I|4.0|This movie was great on DVD, but had very little change on Blue-ray. I imagine the special effects would sound great on a home theater system with say 7.1 surround sound, but this i don't have. so i can give very little input on the sound quality, as for the picture i just did not see a difference. I hope this in some way helps one decide whether or not to buy this movie. Thank you.
0545123275|5.0|This book came exactly as I had ordered it.  I wanted a new paperback and it was a new paperback.      The story was fine.  It didn't really have any happy parts so if you are bumming it's not really a good book to read.  I didn't mind it but I kept waiting for things to pick up for the characters and it never really did till the last page.    Other than that it was easy to read and interesting.
B002RWKSII|5.0|You really can't rate this record.      It is so immaculately crafted.  The arrangements are superb, including (predictably) the vocal arrangements.    Much in the way that Johnny Cash appropriated a very large swath of popular music and made it his own, Brian Wilson absorbs Gershwin and, well, it becomes Brian Wilson.    I don't think you can own a more rewarding record.   Great band, Brian's best vocals in years, superior song choices...and that's just to start.  The strings are exemplary.    Let's look forward to Mr. Wilson's covers of Disney kids songs.  And hopefully many more original disks to come.
B003PX85GK|5.0|I initially enjoyed this album when I first heard it, but not until I was able delve into and digest this record was i able to really appreciate it.  This is a record that needs to be listened to as a whole to realize its greatness.  Highly recommended!
030726999X|5.0|I've read the other 2 books and couldn't wait for the library to come through with this last book so i purchased it.  Great read.  Very exciting.  Can't wait to see the Swedish movie in the fall.
0812979656|3.0|I have been to India twice. The first thing I noticed, or rather felt, while reading<br />Roy's novel was the sensation of being catapulted back there--to the smells, to the places, to the images of the streets and the people and the small things--like red betel juice on someone's tongue.<br /><br />Roy captures much of India, which can be very elusive to convey. Much of the flavor she creates and picture she paints I think goes unappreciated by people who have not had the pleasure of having been there. I very much enjoyed this aspect of Roy's work.<br /><br />I also noticed some similarities between Roy and James Joyce. I do not know if Roy read Joyce, but let me point out a few common elements:<br /><br />The creative use of the language of the conqueror (English) to demonstrate control over the conqueror. In Roy's case, this is obviously India/England. For Joyce, Ireland/England.<br /><br />There is a stream of consciousness to much of the writing, and much of it is from the point of view of a child. In addition, there is a strong theme of innocence and experience, and the focus on the small things, the details, the grains of sand, so to speak, that make up the most important aspects of life. To understand the macrocosm through the microcosm... Roy even mentions Ulysses (although Homer, not Joyce).<br /><br />Although Roy's prose does not have the depth of Joyce's, lacking his sophistication and control, and infinite layers of allusions, it does eloquently make use of symbolism, making profound connections to big ideas.<br /><br />Both authors were also charged with obscenity.<br /><br />Despite all these similarities, I found Roy's book to fall just a bit short. Despite all the accolades awarded to Roy, and despite my appreciation for her writing, I found the first 230 pages or so slow-going. I was bored. I kept thinking it would get more entertaining, but I became frustrated with the repetition. I know Roy had a point with these recursive flashbacks, but it still did not make me want to turn the page. Then suddenly, in the chapter of the Optimist and the Pessimist, the pace picked up and carried through with energy until the end.<br /><br />I realize Roy has a non-linear structure, and a complex one at that, almost like a spider spiraling its web. I would like to go back again and reread the book to fully appreciate the patterns and chronology. Still, if an author bores a reader, he/she hasn't completely fulfilled her obligation.<br /><br />Still, The God of Small Things is definitely worth the journey to India! And if you haven't been there, you should definitely make plans to go!<br /><br />Kevin Glavinll did not make me want to turn the page.

0143038419|1.0|The author got bored to hell about life suddenly in the 30's even after having a good  income, education , excellent country, friends, husband etc. And she starts enjoying the world with our money (Publisher's money doesn't fall from sky), learns new language, gets fresh friendship and sex with  a man in 50's(who knows how many women he's cheated in life), all under the banner called LOVE. Women, in general, if they follow the author, are surely bound for a failure in life.

0446567337|1.0|Dear John,     You sucked.     I'm sorry to pain you, but that is the unhappy truth. Granted, I first began reading the book already prejudiced against it, but I was secretly hoping it would turn out to be spectacularly brilliant, or at least be one of those guilty pleasure-type books. I was miserably disappointed.     The story gets rolling with John, a troubled young man who joined the army because he was bored with his life and couldn't think of anything else to do. On a two week leave, he goes home to visit his father, and during his stay he meets a young woman named Savannah. They have their little intrigue, and by the time the two weeks are up, they're madly in love. John leaves her with the promise that he'll come back to her in a year. But the events of 9/11 end up changing his plans drastically. I'm sorely tempted to go ahead and spoil the rest of the plot for you, but I'm in a charitable mood tonight.     After hearing from everyone what an amazingly powerful love story Dear John  was, I was hoping for a really deep, substantive romance. What I got, however, was a namby-pamby romance in which the deepest feelings fail to rival those involved in a middle school crush. Maybe nowadays, that's what passes for a romance, but after reading Jane Eyre, it just didn't make the cut for me. Comparing Nicholas Sparks' mediocre work with Charlotte Bronte's masterpiece probably isn't entirely fair, though. John's 'love' for Savannah doesn't seem to extend beyond how cute and nice she is, and how good she looks in a bikini. Which is pretty much all there is to her anyway. And if Savannah had really loved John, she would not have done what she does towards the end of the book. At the end of the novel, John sells his dead father's coin collection and uses the money to do something really big and magnanimous for Savannah. This is portrayed as some kind of 'sacrifice' on John's part, which is hogwash, because John didn't care two straws about his dad's coins, and was probably glad to get rid of them.     Savannah. Okay, so she's really really pretty, and really really nice, believes in God and does charity work and all that. Which is great. But there's just something wanting. She lacks depth. She's just not an interesting character. If she had had a little dry wit, or if her faith was emphasized more than it was, that would be at least a step in the right direction. Throughout the book, Savannah reminded me of frosting--so sweet it makes you sick. She doesn't have any other flavors to her, no spice, no sourness, no salt, nothing savory. Just sweet. Blech.     John himself could have been a complex character. Emphasis on the could have been.  A troubled youth who has a rocky relationship with his father, and suffers from problems with drinking and committing to women--now THAT should have made for an interesting character. But he wasn't. John was a very boring narrator. If he had had a sense of humor, the whole book would have been improved significantly. As it is, John plods along through the story as if the events he is describing are the most boring and unexciting things he's ever done. I tried reading it out loud at one point--I could scarcely keep myself from reading in a monotone.     Dear John has its good points. It's nice that one of the main characters has a strong belief in God, for one thing, although that fact isn't emphasized as much as I would have liked it to be. It's a pretty clean story, too, except for one particular scene, where John and Savannah decide to have sex for the first time. It's painted by the author to be this beautiful and touching moment between the two of them, despite the fact that they're not married. But then, these days we do everything backwards anyway--move in together, have kids, and THEN: \\"Oh, gee, honey, maybe we should get married!\\" Novel thought indeed.     That being said, overall, Dear John was a pretty boring read. I most definitely would NOT read it again, which is saying a lot coming from me, because when I really like a book, I always make sure to pay it the compliment of reading it again. And again, and again and again... Don't get me wrong here, I'm all for a light, easy to digest book that doesn't really have a lot of substance to it, but this one is just not my kind of junk food, I guess. So, if you think you'll like it, go for it. But if you end up utterly despising it, just remember...I told you so. ;)    -Carissa Wintheiser  08/18/10
B002ZG980U|5.0|After Nolan's success with Dark Knight, he earned the privilege to risk making a film that might not work. Inception took that risk and came out ahead. I believe Nolan's place on the list of the greatest film directors of our generation is cemented.      With DiCaprio as the lead actor, Nolan as the director and Hans Zimmer as the composer; those three areas could not go wrong. The idea of the film was not of instant appeal and I was afraid that it might be film's shortcoming from what otherwise seemed to be a completely engrossing film. Dreams...what an ambiguous idea for a movie and potentially, a cliche ridden plot. Fortunately, I was gravely mistaken.    The script was the best part. A reality (controversially) on top of a dream, within a dream within a dream. If you do not want to look closely at the confusing nature of these four worlds, how they overlap, how they are different, why one thing in one world may (or may not) effect what goes on in another world, then, Inception is not for you. To call the story an enigma is an understatement. Deciphering the enigma is most of the fun the film has to offer. I got most of it the first time but there are still one or two things I do not understand. But for a thinking man looking for an intellectual challenge, Inception may be a rare treat. I cannot say too much about the plot within giving anything away, but I can say that it very cleverly explores the complexity of our minds.    Films like this are not made very often. Carpe Diem! I highly recommend it!
B0036TGSR6|5.0|A stellar cast and gripping screenplay catapults this brilliant piece of film into heights shared only by a select few. Oliver Stone's 'JFK', Ron Howard's 'Frost/Nixon' and Alan J. Pakula's 'All The President's Men' are among them. Polanski captures the mood of the piece with every conceivable tool at his disposal. From the gloomy weather to the unsettling nature of the supporting cast, deception plays key in this labyrinth of twists and turns that leaves the viewer guessing time and time again. All the while building up to a stunning climax that leaves you with two questions dangling over your head:<br /><br />1. Could this sleeper be the main contender for the title of 'Best Picture' in 2011?<br /><br />2. How much of this story is 'fiction'?<br /><br />I'll let you decide.
B0017T4IG0|5.0|This was one of my favorite movies when I was young. The first time I saw when I was about 7 or 8, I remember it had an effect on me. It's very funny, creative, and has a bitter sweetness to it I can appreciate. And I did not realize until I read a review recently that Bud Cort is the voice of Edgar, the computer. Oh, that makes me want to own it all the more.
1563899426|4.0|As a stand-alone volume, I am not sure that this volume would be worth the read.  The arc presented here is a fairly basic 'who done it' that resolves nicely around the last few pages.  The writer is very conscious of the genre he is aping, and I am not sure if that is a benefit to the reader or not. It works, but only just so.<br /><br />I am interested though, in reading more of the series.  The creatures of the fairy tale lands have been chased from their ancestral homes of fairy or whatever you might call it.  They have settled in New York: the humanoids came to the city; the others came to a farm in upstate New York.  The duality between the real and the fantasy is not new, per se: I was reminded of Neil Gaiman's [[ASIN:0060557818 Neverwhere: A Novel]].  My interest is piqued though, so I hope the creative team behind this work develops both the characters and the tension of their relationships.  They were chased away by a foe called 'The Adversary,' which is the literal translation of 'Satan' if I remember correctly so I hope they don't just drop the idea.<br /><br />I am interested in the further progress of the characters and their stories, but the self-contained nature of the volume actually might keep me away from further consumption of the books.  There's no real tension drawing me forward and making me want to read the next text.
B00280LYIM|5.0|Once again,  Rick Riordan does not cease to impress me. When I finished The Titan's Curse I tried to move on to Dean Koontz's Odd Thomas but had to put it down after the first chapter because I was too busy thinking what would happen in the Battle of the Labyrinth. I'm certainly glad I read it - I was just as impressed as I was with the third book.     Riordan's writing is absolutely addictive. His characters are so true to life and well-rounded that you wish you could embark on their quests with them. I certainly wish I was a half-blood! This book in particular tied off several loose ends for me (I'm being vague on purpose - definitely think you should read it instead of me giving it away) and left me satisfied enough to take a break before reading the last book. The Titan's Curse left with a huge cliff hanger - this one, not so much. I'm going to take some time off before I read the last book - I want to try to \\"save it\\".     I wrote this in my review for the third book, but I really think that every young adult should read this book. I grew up with the Harry Potter books so I feel like I almost matured with Harry Potter. I feel like Percy Jackson could be like that too. Percy and his friends seem to mature through the books so it makes a nice progression. The plot line gets more serious, there is a little more romance (nothing too mature for a younger audience though), and they face even more dangerous situations than they do in the past. I'm so excited to read the last book, but I'm certainly going to be sad when there is no more Percy Jackson left to read. Oh well, I will just have to read them all again!
B000002KLZ|4.0|Finally picked up the Fleetwood Mac CD of their 1980 tour, \\"Fleetwood Mac Live\\".  A 2-disc set (though I'm sure the inevitable re-mastered re-release will have even more songs crammed onto a single disc), this is some of the most energetic Mac you'll ever hear.  The girls' (Nicks & McVie) songs pulse with a life their studio forebears - great though they may be - lack.  It's Buckingham's songs, however, that are the revelation.  After absorbing the then-burgeoning New Wave/Punk movements, Buckingham saw fit to inject his Mac contributions with Talking Heads-like yelps and yips, while his end-of-the-world guitar playing is nothing short of incendiary throughout.  In short, we get a glimpse of the Fingerpickin' Madman that would reveal himself to the world a few years later with the release of his (unbelievably awesome) \\"Go Insane\\" solo album.<br /><br />I found the set for a decent price through an amazon marketplace vendor, and bought a new copy for under $20.  However, considering that a good bit of the Fleetwood Mac catalogue has been expanded and re-mastered, I was a little disappointed to find out that this live gem had yet to be updated.  Considering the age of this release and the fact that there has been no update, I was not happy about the price I paid.  Oh well.  What's done is done . . .<br /><br />There are a couple of new songs on this set, the most appealing being a gorgeous re-working of the Brian Wilson's \\"The Farmer's Daughter\\".  Both McVie & Nicks offer a new song each and they pretty much live up to the Mac standard.<br /><br />If you're looking for definitive live versions of the \\"Fleetwood Mac\\", \\"Rumours\\" & \\"Tusk\\" tunes, this is the disc to go with.  As opposed to, say, the more recent \\"The Dance\\" live disc, this one provides a much clearer snapshot of the band at it's creative (and chemically altered) peak.  Pure 70's gravy.<br /><br />Finally - while I have the venue - I would like to appeal to Warner Brothers to go ahead and update the remainder of the (Buckingham/Nicks affiliated) Fleetwood Mac catalogue.  In addition to the live set discussed here, it's time to clean up \\"Mirage\\" & Tango in the Night\\" - along with the first two Buckingham solo albums, \\"Law & Order\\" and \\"Go Insane\\".  You know, \\"Out of the Cradle\\" probably wouldn't suffer any ill-effects from a little touch up, too.<br /><br />Hey - if the Van Halen catalogue is worthy, certainly the very influential and pristine pop of Fleetwood Mac deserves at least the same consideration.filiated) Fleetwood Mac catalogue.

B003JTHESA|5.0|4 years and finally, new stuff from Maiden!  Already with classic feel allover it! GREAT CD!   10 songs! More like 11,.. since the first one is actually, 2 songs connected. I can say I like them all for different Reasons.  Surprising intro to the album, Satelite 15 is a tribal brum beat massive opener!   \\"El Dorado\\" is different than typical Maiden! Love it!    I hear sound from the 80's and 90's, brought to a production style \\"less Is more\\", that I love!    But one thing definitely makes me hooked to this album: you get something new everytime you listen. This is not typical metal formula where you're hooked to a song in 2 minutes, but get bored after 10th time you listen..  This is different. You listen to \\"Starblind\\" as many times you want and love it even more, because you find something better in it. And that is just an example.  Musicianship wise, I love Nicko's drums. Also, I am very happy Bruce uses different voice tones than only the \\"siren\\" mode. This, he brought from his great solo years.   The trio of guitar is always fun to listen to and bass wall Harris is there.  Even the songs where the intro is slow, bass based, maiden-like, are better on this album. Because there is somethign different in all of them: \\"Avalon\\", great lyric and chorus, \\"Wind Blows\\", moving pace and chorus.  When you are listening, pay attention to it. Every note has effort behind it.  Take time to listen and you'll find I am right.    Maybe best album since Seventh Son... Although Brave New World cuts it close.  Least Favourite Song: Mother Of Mercy  Best Song: Wind Blows, Starblind.    UP THE IRONS!  THIS IS A BAND. HEAVY ROCK BAND!  THIS IS MAIDEN!  SCREAM FOR ME ........!
B00009RAJH|5.0|The first Fleetwood Mac release with the addition of singer-writer-guitarist Lindsey Buckingham & singer-songwriter Stevie Nicks, this is the one most often overlooked, as it pre-dates The Masterpiece, RUMOURS.  Often considered batting practice to RUMOURS game-action homerun hitting, one listen now to this well-cleaned up version of FLEETWOOD MAC shows that the short-shrift is unwarrented.<br /><br />\\"Crystal\\" and \\"Landslide\\" are two of the Mac's most enduring \\"slow songs\\", while Madman-in-Training Lindsey Buckingham's \\"I'm So Afraid\\" freakout was & is a much-anticipated staple of the Fleetwood Mac (and solo Buckingham) live show.  \\"Warm Ways\\", \\"Monday Morning\\" & \\"Rhiannon\\" are three of the band's signature tunes, while \\"Over My Head\\" & \\"Say You Love Me\\" are two of their biggest hits.  Not bad for batting practice.<br /><br />Personally, I like FLEETWOOD MAC as much - or more than - RUMOURS.  To me, the real jewel in the band's crown remains TUSK, however, as the Mac was never more adventurous.<br /><br />The reality is, if you appreciate Pop Music in its finest form, you need to have ALL of the Buckingham/Nicks-affiliated Fleetwood Mac albums.  And the Lindsey Buckingham solo albums, LAW & ORDER, GO INSANE, OUT OF THE CRADLE, UNDER THE SKIN, GIFT OF SCREWS & the live CD/DVD set, LIVE AT THE BASS PERFORMANCE HALL.  So do yourself a favor . . . and get moving!

B00009RAJI|5.0|What more can you say about RUMOURS that hasn't been said . . . a thousand times?  One of pop's greatest statements, RUMOURS endures as nostalgia in the hearts & minds of 70's teens now all grown up, as well as in the heads of younger musicians and music lovers for its passion & guitar growl.  Hey - even grunge embraced the Magic, as Hole saw fit to cover \\"Gold Dust Woman\\".<br /><br />No need to run down the cuts track-by-track; most of us know the playlist by heart.  What is important to remember about RUMOURS is that while it yielded no less than five radio hits, the remainder of the album is probably better than those five songs.<br /><br />Fleetwood Mac was one of the last 70's-style FM radio bands to benefit from the free-form nature of the FM format and RUMOURS provides a nice opportunity to contrast the difference between radio yesterday & today:  70's FM educated people; today's radio pacifies them.  An album like RUMOURS would be impossible today, as radio would never think to offer so many of its cuts up for consumption.  Today, all you need is a hook, a gimmick and a video with a little skin & innuendo.  After that, it's onto the 'ol scrap heap, with all the other flavors-of-the-week.  Next!<br /><br />So hop into the time warp and return to a more trusting time.  Let what everyone says about RUMOURS wash over you; give in to the experience.  Believe what all those silky-toned 70's FM deejays said.  Forget about that no-talent Lady Gaga (don't worry - you will soon enough, anyway).  Embrace what truly talented and committed musicians have to offer.  Buy into the RUMOURS.
B003JTHETY|5.0|Not your typical Maiden album,but I must say I'm very impressed with this album.I was lucky enough to see Maiden this year in Germany at the Wacken Open Air festival,very incredible show if Ido say myself! No one does it like Maiden.Steve Harris usually was the biggest contributer on every other Maiden Album,this one was a total band contribution. Janick,Adrian,and Bruce,are the backbone of this release,with Steve,Dave,and Niko adding their crushing drive to push this one over the top!  Well worth the money you will spend on it.
B00371QQ2U|1.0|What a disappointment!  This movie is easily in my top 5 favorite movies of all time so this review has NOTHING to do with the film itself.  This review is completely directed at the Blu-Ray \\"experience\\"    When I finally purchased a Blu-Ray player, I was determined to replace my regular, \\"Apollo 13\\" DVD with this \\"improved\\" version.  Well, once I received it, I was disgusted.  In short, after 8 minutes of twiddling-around with menus, previews, advertisements and social-networking nonsense, I think I finally got to the movie at which point, I didn't care anymore!  I think it looked a little better better and may have sounded better but, it made no difference whatsoever, given the agonizing length of time it took to even get to that point.  The mere fact that after about 5 minutes of loading, you have to select the language each and every time you play the disc was enough to put me over the edge and I promptly retuned it.  Thankfully, I kept my original, DVD version and it happily remains in my collection, forever able to display the movie for me at a moments notice!

B003JTHESA|5.0|It's kind of interesting to see the reviews - there's a handful of people who think the band has \\"gone too far\\" and a number who think this is \\"more of the same\\"!  In reality, the band has done just the right thing - varied it up enough to make it a new, interesting album, and stayed true enough to their sound to make it still an Iron Maiden album.  It kind of reminds me of \\"7th Son\\" -it took me a few listens to get into it, but it rewarded those listens with increased musical interest.  Similar to that album as well, it has a distinctly different sound to their previous albums that nonetheless is 100% Iron Maiden.       The other main negative review is more confusing, those who lament that it's not a bunch of short speed-metal songs!  Where have these people been for the past 10-20 years?  Honestly, even \\"Somewhere in Time\\" from 1986 was mostly 7-minute epics.  I would say prog-tinged epics are more representative of what Iron Maiden is about than the short, fast songs; certainly for the past decade of their career (during which they haven't exactly been hiding).  Not to mention the fact, that there's been plenty of younger bands popping up over the years doing that kind of stuff (most of whom were heavily influenced by Iron Maiden).  You want that kind of music, pick up some of Blaze Bayley's recent stuff, Finntroll, Nevermore, anything from a slew of European power metal bands, there's plenty of variations on it to chose from.         After hearing the two samples the band released (the abridged \\"Final Frontier\\" video and \\"El Dorado\\") I was more concerned about Bruce's vocals.  But, although he certainly isn't the \\"air raid siren\\" of the mid-80s, his singing works fine here.  He leans a little more towards \\"crooning\\" than he used to, but again that's a trend from the past decade, and indeed there's a number of times that remind me of his solo work from the 90s.  Bruce has always been great at being a singing story-teller, and his talents are well used here.The album does have a lot of slow introductions, a power ballad (\\"Coming Home\\"), and a slower epic at the end (but, it's not as slow as the semi-ballad \\"Journeyman\\"), but it's still pretty firmly based in classic metal, and there's plenty of guitar riffage to be had.  Like the previous \\"A Matter Of Life And Death\\", there's a lot of music happening here to listen to (although it's not quite as heavy and rock-solid), which has always been my favorite thing about Iron Maiden (although they scaled back a bit on this in the 90s).  So, while this isn't the heaviest Maiden album, it doesn't come across as weak or non-metal, and (even more important) it doesn't drag or lose momentum.  There's lots of changes and musical ideas going on, and it stays interesting from beginning to end.       So, if you like Iron Maiden, and not just a short portion of their past career, you should like this.  If you like their recent albums, you should like this.  This might even appeal to those for whom Iron Maiden was too heavy.  And, (this should seem obvious), if you haven't liked Iron Maiden's recent stuff, you probably won't like this one either!  Although (and I'll need a few more listens to decide) this may be their best album in years.     A little add-on to my review - I listened to it through headphones today, and I think this time they've REALLY USED 3 guitars!  The previous albums didn't seem to utilize the three guitar attack as much as I'd hoped(although, maybe I should give them a little more headphone action, too?), but this one has a lot of complex arrangements going on.
B000002J1U|1.0|I personally thought this was going to be a great quality of CD...but Not pleased with it. Is not the original...the paper, colors just tell you this is a \\"copied\\" disc from the original version. So, NO !
B003ELOQCK|5.0|I was thrilled to know that Amazon found the DVD that I wanted so much. Shopping on Amazon is much easier than going out to a physical retail store and browsing. Because of Amazon, I now enjoy watching this DVD frequently. I look forward to doing more shopping on Amazon in the future.
B003JTHESA|3.0|I will start off by saying that I love both the 80's Maiden material and most of the cds up to Dance of Death.  In particular, I feel that Brave New World and Dance of Death belong with the classics.  To illustrate further, I saw Maiden in concert last month and the band was as tight and amazing as ever and Dickinson still proved he could rock like it's 1983.    Now, on to the Final Frontier.  One of the songs Maiden played at the show I was at was \\"El Dorado\\".  This is the most basic of all the songs on the album.  I thought it was decent but was glad at the time to hear that the rest of the album was nothing like this song.  I made a point to give this album a few good listens before rating but now I have my conclusion.  Like in concert, the band is as tight as ever.  Some of the guitar solos are off the wall on this album, with my favorite being on \\"The Talisman\\".  It's a new guitar solo yet it's so much on par, or maybe even better than, the solos on the classic songs.  The lyrics are also fantastic.  It seems like Dickinson can never cease to come up with amazing lyrics.    However, the reason I only rate this as a 3 star is because I feel Dickinson has lost an octave on this recording.  In concert he was able to hit the high pitches on the songs without any problem.  Here it seems like he's actually trying to shy away from the high pitched vocals he's known for.  On parts of \\"The Talisman\\" he does reach the high pitch but it's almost like his voice is cracking.  My feeling is that I'm not sure whether to blame Dickinson's age or the production of the album for this.  I just can't get past the fact that him singing these songs make me feel like he's half-assing it - even after writing such great lyrics.  Maybe over time this will grow on me more but I know I will never be able to put it in the same category as Brave New World, Dance of Death, Number of the Beast, Piece of Mind, and Somewhere In Time.

Millions of People have been killed and are being subjected to cruel religious rituals from being burnt as witches to being stoned for adultery. Brutal wars have been fought over whose gods or godesses are the only true ones. In a mental institution thus behavior might be expected, in real life it is about time for reason.

0385491026|5.0|Cat's Eye is amazing in it's nuances.  Atwood is the queen of creating a story that never peaks, but never quite bottoms out, a steady heart beat the whole way.  In Cat's Eye, I felt like I was told a story of the life of a woman, Elaine, who ruminated on all the details of her life without ever becoming insufferable.  She describes each person who has touched her life with offhand comments and wit, throwing out quote after memorable quote.  Even the characters that are only noticed for a moment, have awesome description, such as \\"She is post everything.  She is what will come after post.\\"  I felt her unspoken heart break as I read through her youth, occasionally transvering back to her middle age, where she had to deal with the subtle frustrations of the pink elephants of double standard that come with being a woman.  Atwood is the master of planting little seeds of thought, and crafting an intricate world of reality around her characters.  The book ended masterfully, creating and merging Elaine into an actual person, from her youth to her present, in the starlight.  \\"There's old light and there's not much of it.  But there's enough to see by.\\"
0547258305|4.0|This book is all about action, fighting, and drama...and the cool thing, is that the main character is a girl.  Awesome action book with the female empowerment aspect.  Great read and detail to fight scenes.  Trailed off near the end...but you are enticed by the main character that you continue.  Cool concept of humans with abilities.
0143118420|3.0|I liked the book somewhat but was disapointed to learn that Julia Roberts would be playing the main character in the movie.  I never would picture her in that part (not a fan).  I thought Anne Heche would have been a better choice.  She and Gilbert look alike and have the same depth and sardonic sense of humor.  They really missed the boat on this one. As far as the book goes, I got a little bored towards the end and wondered when she was going to reach some sort of Nirvana, if ever.  Do we all need to go on an around-the-world journey in order to find ourselves?  This can be accomplished in the peace and solitude of one's own space, where ever that may be.  Happiness is not something that can be \\"found\\" so it is not about the pot of gold at the end of the rainbow, but the process of finding our way.  She may have returned home unfulfilled (as many of us do) only to find she had grown and had taken a small step towards a new and different direction in her life.   This process can change throughout one's lifetime so we should be open to the prospect of successes and disappointments along the way.  Acceptance is a powerful emotion that can bring us into the promise of new possibilities.   Sometimes, that is enough.

Favorite tracks: the gorgeous 'Someone to Watch Over Me', the Little St Nick inspired 'Can't Take That Away From Me', a soulful and haunting 'Summertime\\" (love the swirling background vocals), and 'Nothing But Love', one of the \\"new\\" numbers, a densely layered gem that would have been right at home on Sunflower.

B003JTHESA|4.0|Okay folks, here it is. This is my honest to god opinion of the new album from Iron Maiden, The Final Frontier. You can debate, you can argue, you can disagree with me as you please.<br /><br />I really, truly, honest to god liked it better than any of their other albums since the reunion with Bruce and Adrian. It might even be better than Fear Of The Dark (see the bottom for my specifics on that).<br /><br />This album is not for everyone. For one thing, it's definitely not for people who don't like heavy music or Iron Maiden. That's obvious. It's also not going to do enough to satisfy those obnoxious \\"I only like the 80's Maiden\\" fans. And if you don't like long songs, then for the most part this album is definitely not for you. And those who want new surprises out of their old band, I'm afraid you're going to come up short after the very beginning of the album. But otherwise, give the album a good, long, hard listen.<br /><br />The opening track, \\"Satellite 15... The Final Frontier,\\" is somewhat divided into two songs. When I looked at the length, I thought, \\"Oh no, they aren't going to OPEN this album the way they CLOSED the last one, are they?\\" Thankfully I was very off on that assumption, because the \\"Satellite 15\\" segment is quite unlike anything Maiden has ever done before. It opens with industrial double kick drums and almost Fear Factory-esque guitar riffage, coupled with space effects and vocals that sound like a distant call for help in space. \\"The Final Frontier\\" segment is pretty standard Iron Maiden fare and is good but nothing special.<br /><br />However, in spite of the mostly standard and not-too-special intro, several tracks bring back very good memories of classic Iron Maiden material. \\"El Dorado\\" and \\"Isle Of Avalon\\" bring back the gallop sound; the latter has a clean guitar intro that actually uses the same tempo and builds into it with very convincing results, while the former gets right to the point. And \\"The Alchemist\\" brings back that speed metal sound that was so popular in the 80's, stylized with classics like \\"Aces High.\\" It's been a long, long time since that was employed.

0691142165|5.0|I don´t always agree with Rogoff´s world view but this is just great financial history and will stay on my library shelf.  The boom, bust, repeat process is undeniable now.  As much as I am a believer in the \\"global growth story\\" because I simply assess that we are in a fundamentally growing world and I think emerging markets are building unprecedented demand, inspite of the stumbling blocks.  However,this tale tells another vision.  Basically, the authors think that future national debt crises and rising inflation are going to derail the global economy.  As an economist, I take their view seriously.  We all have to vigilantly observe the flow of economic data these next years.  It is no time for idealogues.  The proof will be in the pudding and let´s just hope Rogoff and company are wrong.  It is a great reference book regardless of where you see the global economy going.

1595141979|5.0|So third installment in the Vampire Academy series, we are back at the Academy a couple of weeks after Rose has killed her first Strigoi and things are not quite right. Rose has been forever changed by the events that lead up to Mason's death and so has everyone else that was there with her. This definitely increases the dark undertone that these books have had because Rose has a darker outlook on life. She is no longer thinking about what outfit she should wear tomorrow or how cute her hair looks, as her birthday approaches she really only wants one thing    \\"Freedom, I thought. That was the only gift I longed for. Freedom to make my own choices. Freedom to love who I wanted\\"    That line really sums it up the best I think. Rose is struggling with who she is and what the priorities in her life should be. She is also quickly becoming one of my favorite characters, I love her sarcastic attitude mixed with her ability to kick anyone's butt who attempts to take a swing at her or her friends. Which now that she has entered the field training portion of her senior year, she gets to take a swing at quite a few people and get out some of that aggression.    I also have a confession to make, I am starting to like Adrian, I know...I still don't think he belongs with Rose, but he really is growing on me. He is funny, and even though he might not want other people to know about it he really does care about people around him and try to help out when he can. Which he does demonstrate big time towards the beginning of this book. And all that joking aside, I really think he does care for Rose and wants a chance to date her, not that she is going to give into that right now. Why is that? Well Dimitri is still around and he is still the one I am rooting for. Although getting some alone time between him and Rose is very difficult and it is definitely starting to weigh on them both.    Okay, the next part I might get people throwing things at me for but here goes. While reading, I gotup to get something to drink and I noticed on the back cover of this book it says \\"The obvious heir to the Twilight throne...\\" Really? Don't get me wrong, I love Twilight, I really do! It has a great story and I read all 4 books in one week, no seriously, I did. I did not sleep very much, it was bad. Anyways, that being said I don't think these two books can really be put in the same category. Just because they both have vampires in them doesn't mean they are the same book. Rose is a much stronger character and I like the view from her seat much better than Bella's. Rose is much more complex and her life is just more interesting to me. Vampire Academy also has a lot of layers to it and I like getting to peal them back book by book. I also like all the character development we are getting in these books and the fact that things aren't always pretty, there are causalities when you live in these worlds and Richelle Mead is not afraid to rip at your heart strings and kill off characters. I know that sounds morbid, but I feel like a book that takes place in a world where there is constant fighting and paranormal creatures, you are going to lose some people. That doesn't mean I like it, I was horrified when Mason died. I had to put the book down and walk away for a minute, but it made sense and it made the book more realistic. Is all this making sense?    Along those realistic lines, towards the end I was getting a little more than annoyed with Lissa, which I will not say why because I do not want to spoil it but if anyone else has read this I think you know what I am talking about right? She needs to step back and look at the bigger picture here because she is getting on my nerves. I am hoping to be back on her side when I read the next book.    To sum up, I am loving these books! I am also trying to read them slowly because I know I have to wait until D-e-c-e-m-b-e-r for the last one and I am not a very patient person. But Richelle Mead has me hooked on these books. She paints a dark picture of a world that I get lost in when I pick these books up. So if you have not started the series yet, what are you waiting for?    Language Love:    \\"Leafless tree branches swayed in that wind, clawing at the sides of the stone dorm like fingernails.\\"    How could I not love this one? I picture that scene in my head perfectly and I love the idea of branches clawing, great description.
B001F5TAD2|5.0|Book came on time and was in great condition. I couldn't have been happier with the sender.
0545123283|4.0|First off this is a 4 1/2 not 4, just wanted to put in that little clarification. I cannot even explain how excited I am to have gotten an ARC of this. I have actually had it since March, thanks to the wonderful owner at The Fountain Bookstore, but I still pre-ordered a signed copy of my own! Ok, so onto my review of Linger. If you don't know (which if you don't know this book I think you might have been living under a rock) Linger is the second book of a trilogy, the first book being Shiver. I loved the tone of Shiver, it was sweet and innocent and so hopeful. The tone of Linger is quite different, it feels melancholy and you can almost see the despair dripping from the pages of the book. I am not sure if everyone feels that way after they read it or if Maggie even intended it to read that way but that is how I felt after I finished the book. That does not mean I did not like it, I did, it just had a sad undertone.<br /><br />Linger picks up where Shiver left off, Sam is trying to adjust to life as a human and finds that he is still in denial over never becoming a wolf again. Grace is trying to be with Sam as much as possible, keeps getting frequent headaches, and has to deal with her overprotective parents who are not so happy with how serious Grace is getting with Sam. While we are on that subject, Grace's parents are driving me crazy! They have been absent pretty much her whole life and now is the time they decide to pay attention? They jump to all the wrong conclusions and just get in the way throughout this story, I was rooting for Grace to just tell the off.<br /><br />In Linger we also get the introduction of a new character Cole, who is running from his past and finds that becoming a wolf becomes the perfect escape for him. Cole becomes one of the narrators in this story along with Isabel, Grace and Sam. So in Linger we have four narrators, which gives the reader multiple perspectives and really paints a complete picture. I also like getting inside Isabel's head in this one, she becomes the surprising voice of reason in the story.<br /><br />The only downside to Linger for me was that I felt like I never really got a moment a \\"happy\\" moment for Sam and Grace like we did in Shiver. Get your minds out of the gutter, I just mean I felt like we never get to see them just happy for more than a page or two. There was so much going on that they don't really have down time and I missed that. It probably has a lot to do with all the conflicts that arise in their lives, but I still missed just seeing Grace and Sam happy. I also feel like the ending happened in fast forward, which was good because I kept reading and could not put the book down, but on the downside I was left seriously wanting at the end. Which come to think of it might have been Maggie's point, to leave us wanting more.<br /><br />If you liked Shiver then you should pick up Linger and see how the story continues to develop. Sam and Grace are still the main focus but Cole definitely shakes some things up, especially for Isabel. I eagerly await the final book in this series, Forever, to see what happens to all of the characterse, she becomes the surprising voice of reason in the story.

B000001FTD|5.0|This was my first Anthrax album and it is probably my favorite of theirs. Like most of the reviewers on here have already stated, it is an awesome album. Just wanted to add my recommendation. Go buy it!
B003JTHESA|4.0|Not since Brave New World have i enjoyed a Maiden release as much as The Final Frontier, it really has all elements of all of the Maiden past CD'S.  Most of the songs take different directions that you wouldn't predict plus this CD has a more progressive sound, there is even 2 ballads!.Maiden has been around for over 30 years, they do there own thing and it shows!The more i listen to this CD the more i like it.Don't get me wrong the stuff in the 80's was great but bands have to evolve and this band still has it!  great CD   UP THE IRONS!
B003JTHESA|5.0|I'm actually going to list my complaints with the album first, because it's a short list and it wont take very long.  Let's see--    1)- Too many songs have long, slow intros.  2)- ...Uuuuhh...    That's all I could come up with.  Now let's talk about the good stuff.      I enjoyed every song on the album.  Some more than others, but even the weaker tracks were quite good.  Among the highlights you'll find Starblind and The Talisman, which are among the best songs Iron Maiden have ever done, and Iron Maiden have done a lot of terrific songs.  Looked at as a whole, the playing is tight and the production, for the first time in many years, sounds great.  My favorite thing about the album though, is the impressive sense of drama present throughout.  The songs have a grandeur to them that you rarely hear outside of the theater; I love that.      If you want to enjoy a really groovy record, written and played on a grand scale, you should pick this album up.  I will offer one warning-- Don't buy this record if you have a short attention span.  If your mind wanders while listening you'll miss a lot of what makes the record great, and you wont enjoy it half as much.  For everyone else-- I highly recommend The Final Frontier.
0375812024|1.0|I guess scary is the word. We needed some book that would somehow prepare our little one  (5 years old) to the plane travel and we rushed to the local book store and grabed what they had and this happened to be one of the two choices they had on the topic. I did not think much as I paid for it happy that I secured some book of an author that has good reputation in the children book area.<br /><br />Little I know what I got into until my little one ask me to read it for bed time the day we bought it.<br />So here we are.. I am reading the book .. jolly good mood and all..<br /><br />And all of the sudden I am seeing all those cute scens all over the airport, they look funny to me but I think again as my little one is about to notice every single detail and being super observant as they are at this age<br />and quite sensitive to that.. I will have lot of explaining why:<br /><br />1. Two airplains are crashing into eachother (passanger jet liners) in the background of one of the major scenes..<br />2. Why all belongings as in suitcases are bing tossed into the airplane and some of the crash on the ground<br />and everything spills out of them (yeah one of them you can see right there on the cover, just take closer look as one kitty is loading the suitcase on the belt and suitcase go south and all the stuff spills out.<br /><br />3. Why the sutcase are bing opened in the little transporters that carry them through the airport grounds and how the suitcases have the stuff flying out of them..<br /><br />4. Airplain without wings and other major parts being scaattered around in haphazard manner like seats and all..<br />to suggest that the plain can just.. oh well.. loose it's wings.. what however not true for  airliners as they are apparently build around their wings and you can't just detatch them like from little planes but still..<br />would you like your little one to worry that the wings can just go kaboom during the flight?<br /><br />There is more.. much more ofthis type of humor. If you and your little one has stomic for it or the kid is old enogh to take it as a jocke then defenetely go for it.<br /><br />I however myself not necessarely like to think about plain crashing at the airport grounds.. and all those other things abouve and I would have major explaining going on so we just somehow reverted the attention and gave up the book successfuly but I think should we continue it would be more damage then good actually.<br /><br />I can't really imagine what mr. Scarry was thinking puting such images in a book that is designated for little children and does not worry a inapropriate images warning.<br /><br />How do you explain a child that a plains do crash on the runaways, or the luggage yes.. get tossed and things do<br />fly out sometimes..<br /><br />Of course this is true and there is potential to happen but then again is this how a parent immerse a child into<br />airport situations?<br /><br />I have no words, If you can just stop by at the book store and look at the ilustrations and look carefully before you buy, or order it so you can return it if you decide it is not for  you.<br /><br />I wish you happy deciding and I am sure knowing that at the end the rather questionable flying contraption of<br />a hot dog that eventually crashes at the house at the end will make it that much more comfortable.<br /><br />I shared, you decide.
B002UNMW7O|1.0|I was highly disappointed with this movie. The first one was good, but this second one really ruined it for me. It's very juvenile and the story was bad beyond belief. The acting is hambone (some worse than others) and isn't true to the characters from the first one. I watched the movie because I liked the actors, but after watching this movie I like them less. Too bad.

B0000035E7|1.0|In short, Bleach is for hardcore Nirvanaphiles and completists only.  It contains one noteworthy song- About a Girl- which is surrounded by almost a dozen forgettable, two-minute punk rock tracks with childish lyrics.  It wouldn't be until 1991 that Nirvana would assemble an album that not only sounded great, but was comprised almost entirely of catchy, memorable songs.  Bleach, unfortunately, is the complete opposite.
030726999X|4.0|This review is for both book 2 and 3 because I'm lazy.  I thought book 1 was good but a little too gory violent for me (especially because it was violence against women).  Book 2 was my favourite of the trilogy.  It was totally thrilling, chockful of interesting asides about math and gender statistics and legal and mental health facts, and stars plucky fabulous resourceful bisexual heroine, Lisbeth Salander.  I read it in one day flat, from morning til night, and the ending was apocalyptic (if on the edge of unbelievable).<br /><br />Book 3 was also quite exciting (with asides about legendary women's armies) and features a host of awesomely smart sexy competent women - journalist, policewoman, spy, hacker, lawyer - all living full rich lives.  I'm ok with this skew.  I'm also ok with the continuation of the male skew from book 1 where the men are all sensitive smart feminists or misogynist monsters.  This book had a lot more Swedish politics as well as a fascinating dive into the spy world.  It ties up all the loose ends of all 3 books, and despite a few holes and patch-ups, finishes with a dramatic and satisfying flourish.  Well done, and I'm even more sorry not to be able to read more of Mr. Larsson's work.
B000007VCM|5.0|Love is not only The Cult's best album by a country mile, but it's undoubtedly one of the greatest and most unique rock albums of the 1980s.  Combining melodic hard rock with gothic and punk overtones, Love presents The Cult at their creative peak.  Featuring soaring vocals by Ian Astbury and wailing guitars by Billy Duffy, Love contains several truly great rock anthems no weak ones.  The album would be followed up by the boneheaded southern rock-tinged Electric, and then thankfully by the far-superior Sonic Temple.  The best version of Love is the original 1985 printing, as subsequent releases have the sound maxed out and flattened due to rematering.  Be sure to seek that one out.
0783225482|5.0|Everybody knows that Hollywood is full of people who would sell their soul for youth and beauty, but ... literally? They come pretty close in \\"Death Becomes Her,\\" a delightfully wicked, twisted black comedy directed by Robert Zemeckis -- the dialogue is wonderfully barbed, the comedy is warped, and the quartet of lead actors give the performances of a lifetime.<br /><br />Years ago, starlet Madeline Ashton (Meryl Streep) stole plastic surgeon Ernest Menville (Bruce Willis) from her longtime rival, dowdy writer Helen Sharp (Goldie Hawn). Consumed by hatred for Madeleine, Helen becomes an obese recluse and is eventually locked up in a mental institution.<br /><br />Present day (and by that, I mean the 1980s): Madeline and Ernest (now a harpyish has-been and  an alcoholic undertaker) appear at the signing for Helen's bestselling book -- and are shocked to see that she's now a stunning youthful bombshell. This drives Madeline to seek out the services of Lisle von Rhoman (Isabella Rossellini), a sensual sorceress who sells her a potion that restores her youth. A small warning: \\"Take care of your body.\\" Easier said than done.<br /><br />Meanwhile, Helen and Ernest have been plotting to kill her, and a fight leads to Madeleine falling down the stairs and twisting her head 180 degrees. She's not dead... but not really alive either. And the problem is, Helen has had the same treatment -- meaning that when Madeleine gets her revenge, her rival doesn't die either. Is there a way out of this mess, or are the ladies doomed to eternal unlife?<br /><br />If you like moral messages with your warped comedy, here's \\"Death Becomes Her's\\":  a short life lived to the fullest is way better than an empty endless one, and shallow people who try to stay eternally young are pathetic. Nobody can argue with that, but that's not the reason people watch this movie. They watch it for the wickedly warped wit and the hilarious trio of actors.<br /><br />Zemeckis does an absolutely brilliant job with the sort of gothic-screwball plot, which is the perfect mix of ghoulish humor and slapstick. The dialogue is full of witty barbs (\\"You're a fraud, Helen! You're a walking lie and I can see right through you!\\"), and hilarious dialogue (\\"They took her to the morgue.\\" \\"The morgue? She'll be FURIOUS!\\"). And some of the scenes here will make you howl your head off, such as the grand finale -- why can't more movies end this brilliantly?<br /><br />Additionally, Zemeckis brought out the best in all three lead actors. I don't really like Hawn's acting, and tend to consider Willis' mixed -- but Streep and Hawn are deliciously catty, shallow and a little crazed, playing a pair of thoroughly repulsive women. Willis plays Ernest as a depressed mortician who gets increasingly frantic as the story goes on, and Isabella Rossellini is brilliant as the beauty-obsessed sorceress.<br /><br />\\"Death Becomes Her\\" is the sort of movie I wish they would make more often -- a wild, hilarious dark comedy with a twisted streak a mile wide.

B000127LW2|4.0|This series is very good.  The make-up for the first season was ok but it got better as the series progressed.  Overall the series was very good.  The one thing I have a problem with is the price of the first season.  It should be under $50 dollars.  The complete series has been around for awhile so the price of the first season should be at least $30 dollars.  I enjoyed this series because there was a woman in command.      I give Star Trek Voyager season One a 4.5 out of 5.
0061537969|4.0|I love Formula 1, and I love dogs! What a perfect combination for a book. This choice of read was a no-brainer. One thing is clear, you gotta love Enzo! What a great way to personify a dog. The novel however is somewhat bothersome from the perspective that Denny apparently being such a great guy is overcome with so much misfortune. There is a point in which it just seems unbearable and you wish Garth had gone a little easier on the philological torture. Other than that and the fact that the novel ends with a few comments on euthanasia and assisted suicide which in my opinion were completely unnecessary and if anything only stained the almost immaculate and extremely likable image of Enzo, the book was pretty good.    \\"That which you manifest is before you\\", has to be one of the best quotes I've ever read. This is what also made me like the book so much; great quotes and trends of thought regarding race strategy and tackling life in general.  Who's a nice doggy, good work Enzo!
1400052173|5.0|This book was amazing.  I was astounded as a lay person by the science behind HeLa and how one single cluster of cells could manage to impact the lives of millions. The science was presented in a way that was simple to understand and the ethics were presented in a way that leaves you in a conundrum as to whether we should have control over every sample that is taken from our bodies or whether that will stop the progress of medicine.  Ultimately i was incredibly disappointed in John Hopkins and many of the Bio tech firms the fact that they did not contribute to the Lacks family and present them with some sort of endowment for them to live out their lives with some security and peace of mind which they so sorely lacked.<br />Unbelievable story and one that should be told in every school.  I can't believe that as a 39 year old educated woman, I have never heard of the HeLa cells nor their impact on our lives, and similarly that aside from my doctor friends, no one else seems to be familiar with Henrietta Lacks.<br />REQUIRED READING!
0316067938|3.0|To be frank, I began to read this one with very low expectations, after having read the 3 previous books and after a visit to the one starred reviews.  Perhaps this is why I actually didn't dislike the book?    Spoilers - if this is still important after so many months.    What I liked about Breaking Dawn:    1- we finally see Bella and Edward together, and after 3 books it came almost as a relief. I don't mind that it is non-descriptive, my imagination can supply everything else with the info given to me.    2- what I really liked was a finally strong Bella as a vampire. For once she wasn't moping but took action, she did even have some fun, am thinking about her destroying a boulder with her new-found strength, and it was a funny moment. Also when she jumps the river.    3- I truly didn't dislike Renesmee (apart from her name...)She was endearing, even with her teeth and she had a winning side in her like a baby that knows it is loved.    4- On the wolf-side, I liked the insight we get on Leah.    5- On the vampire side, I liked the Roumanian vampires and the Amazonians etc. I wished we had seen more of this new Rosalie and the Volturi.    All in all, compared to New Moon and Eclipse, Breaking Dawn comes first in the order of preference. Because there is some positive things going on. For one, there is not as much of suicidal thoughts because the boyfriend has left the girl with a big hole in her chest. And there is no hesitation or questions (or not as much) about Jacob or Edward, who comes first?    I was still annoyed about many things: the writing, Edward being even more beautiful now that Bella is a vampire and can really see; Edward brooding and forcing his new wife to beg for sex when she has only bruises (nothing broken except the bed); or the whole scene of Bella's pregnancy. Also, the fact that the Volturi come to nothing in the end, or the plot about getting fake papers for Renesemee being totally underused in the end. And lastly, the fact that Jacob imprints on Renesmee. I found that the character of Jacob has been degraded more and more from the nice warm boy of New Moon to Breaking Dawn. Now, he is the rejected ex-not-even-boyfriend who babysits the daughter of the previous love of his life and will eventually be the boyfriend of that baby in 7 years. A bit hard to swallow. It would have been nice to see him with Leah and I think Leah deserved a good ending. We don't even know what happens with the Alpha thing between Sam and Jacob...  Lastly, Edward asking the not-even-ex-boyfriend to sleep with his newly wed bride to get her pregnant...hard to swallow too and made me indignant. Charlie was also a let down.    All in all, many things to dislike, but not as much as New moon or Eclipse. I would have liked the series better if from Twilight, we had jumped right away to Breaking Dawn. Probably because, of the 4 books, those 2 are the most improbable and most fairy-tale like. The 2 middle ones are depressive, dangerous in their messages, and I disliked Bella, Edward and Jacob all together in those, for their choices and their moping around and poor me attitudes.    So: the best feature? Bella finally becoming a vampire.

B002AFX52S|3.0|I have this on the great Criterion original dvd, and decided that the Blu-Ray version would be worth the upgrade. This was a BIG mistake. The film is five stars, and the transfer is one. Sorry Criterion, but you have really screwed up on this one (as you also did on the terrible transfer for The Last Emperor). I am a huge fan of Criterion releases, but this was appalling. The film was as blurry as my original dvd from a few years ago. I tried both to compare, and trust me, there is hardly anything to choose between them. My wife who does not care too much for all the superb definition that Blu-Ray can provide, was just as shocked as I was when the film started. I have a 58 in Panasonic Plasma, with Panasonic player, and I was just so let down by this. I will sell this and keep my original dvd. What a shame!
B000F4RHB6|5.0|This CD has such a great variety of hits!  I am very pleased with the music that was chosen.  All of their biggest hits with some pleasantly mixed in acapella's; you can't go wrong.  I have loved these guys since they came out in the 80's!!!  Hope they are around for a long, long time!!!
B00001ODGR|5.0|I sure wish The original Styx lineup could tour again.The new Styx Lineup is ok however without Dennis DeYoung they are missing something. Anyway I digress, This is a superb DVD Showcasing most of their great music,a must for true Styx fans.
B002ZG97E2|5.0|I was a bit hesitant to see this movie when it 1st came out but decided to give it a chance. LOVED it! It started off kind of slow but then it was non stop funny and touching from then on out. I saw it in 3D the 1st time and took my oldest daughter to see it Sunday night and I loved it even more!! :)    I rank it right up there with Toy Story 3  I can NOT wait for it to come out on DVD!

0061703087|5.0|Prey is science fiction in a much more pure form than what most science fiction writers put out.  Michael Crichton was always brilliant about that.  He did the same thing for Dinosaurs in Jurassic Park, and for many other subjects in his books.  Crichton takes a real idea with real science behind it and takes it to the logical (extreme) conclusions.  What would be the logical conclusion (taken to the extreme) if we figured out how to get Dinosaur DNA and started cloning them? What would happen if we put Artificial Intelligence (A.I.) into nanobots and that intelligence got smarter than we meant it to?<br /><br />That is the story behind Prey.  The scientists are trying to figure out how to program nano-technology to perform tasks as a group.  The story involves what happens when that technology gets out of the control the scientists thought they had over it.  There is also a human side-story of a married couple and suspicion of betrayal which is weaved beautifully into the tale.  It is heart-wrenching, but necessary, and it lends the story the kick it needs to grab you emotionally.<br /><br />It is a gripping tale, and a cautionary tale.  Crichton was a visionary, and the world is lesser for losing him.  At least we have the finished works he did publish, as his legacy.<br /><br />Read Prey.  If you like a good story, you will like it.  If you like a good story, and you are interested in: science, technology, nanotech, A.I., etc. then you will LOVE it.

B0034JKZ8G|4.0|Disney's The Princess and the Frog, on Blu-ray, is first and foremost gorgeous on Blu-ray.  The picture quality is crisp and sharp with eye popping colors and great sound.<br /><br />The story ... is the same pedestrian princess-fantasy drek that Disney has been pumping out since 1937.  Your kids will most likely love it, you are probably getting sick of the story-by-numbers themes that Disney runs.<br /><br />[WARNING!: Philosophy, skip if this bores or offends you]<br />I have to say, I was a little bit surprised to see how Disney portrayed the first African American princess in their animated features.  Yes, I know Disney has a long history of re-telling classic fairy tales with their own take on things, and that many of those tales include a rags-to-riches main character.  But ... for the first African American princess ... a poor New Orleans (complete with southern accent) girl ... really?  I consider myself a fair-minded person, and I can see that this type of story is fair game.  They have been telling the same basic story featuring Western European princesses for decades now: Cinderella being the one that comes most immediately to mind.  I was just surprised that they chose this type of story to feature their first main character African American princess in.  But I guess that shows that society really is making progress towards being color blind?<br />[/END PHILOSOPHY]<br /><br />ANYWAY, that being said, the story is charming.  Their firefly hero, Ray is charming and endearing.  His love for \\"Evangeline\\" (a bright star) is sweet and poignant.  We all loved Louis, the horn blowing jazz player-at-heart.  Tiana, the main character is also believable in her motivations and flaws, as is Prince Naveen as her love/hate interest.<br /><br />My wife and I agreed that the character of Dr. Facilier is both creepy and scary, and that he is also not well explained.  The voodoo magic that he does during the movie, and the things that happen because of it, are most likely to severely frighten small children aged 6 or younger.<br /><br />Overall, the story is good, and has all of the classic Disney touches: rise and fall, true motivations playing out, precarious situations, reversals of fortune, etc.  But is it still a good film, with a decent message, and it is well implemented.  We bought it and we own it now after renting it.  I am not sure if the film is for everyone, but we liked it.d 6 or younger.

B003JTHESA|1.0|I have been a huge fan for over 20 years, and have seen them live many times. I have to say this is the worse bunch of songs they have EVER put out. I have tried to listen to it at least 5 times and find it almost painful to listen to all but one song (When the Wild Wind Blows)I would rather sit in a dentist chair than listen to this garbage. The first song makes me want to pull my hair out and scream........WHAT are you thinking MAIDEN????? I dont know if they are getting to old and cant hear what they are making, or just think we die hard fans will buy anything they put out. UNREAL that after all these years and three great guitar players one of the best bass players in the world and a great singer, that this is what they put out.!! Very dissapointed.<br /><br />Its plain and simple, the songs on this CD are the worst songs Iron Maiden have ever produced in MY opinion. I have every single CD this band has ever put out, and every DVD the band has put out.. This CD to me is almost painful to listen to. The guitar playing, the lyrics, the singing all sound horrible. The songs are boring and have no life to them. They need a new producer that can show that this band can do much better than this garbage.<br /><br />And I am sure that ORWarriOR will comment on my negitive review as he has all the others, and that is his right. But it is also my right to let everyone know what I think about this CD. I think it is important to let people know they might be as dissapointed as I was.
B002SF9YNO|5.0|This is one of the best movies I have ever seen. Its done with feelings from the Soul and the actors where amazing in their acting. I can only say good things about this movie.
0670021652|1.0|So disappointing! She needs to stick to writing fiction only! She is so obviously not a scholar or an intelligent authoritative mind on her subject that it leaves no credibality and a feeling that you're just watching a one ring circus that people paid YOU to watch - waste of time!  I enjoyed watching her struggle out of confusion in her last book because it was more about one womans struggle to feel emotionally comforted again but this one is a disaster! Its full of wrongly picked and plucked and pawed on references that are so flimsy and not well known and if the reference is well known the author isn't educated enough on the subject to put it rightly in context. She embarrasses herself and may have embarrassed herself out of any respectful career in the future in writing.  Maybe go back to writing for junk magazine for hopelessly eneducated public!
B003JTHESA|1.0|Been listening to this record, and just stop everytime halfway. AMOFAD was a damn good album, but this pales. Probably their worst since Virtual XI.
B002L5GQGY|5.0|I, too, saw Joe on TV recently, was impressed at what I heard and took a shot on the DVD.  The DVD arrived today and....wow - this totally surpassed what I saw on TV!  I've heard Bonamassa once before, several years ago, but this 2009 concert at the Albert Hall just blew me away.    I share Joe's love of British blues performers and can't say enough how he is getting up there with the best of the them: Clapton, Beck, Mayall, etc. I wish more people in America knew about him. Bonamassa deserves to be a big name in the music business, not just in the blues field.    Yeah, I knew this guy was a great guitarist but I never realized how good a singer he was until I played this DVD.  It's encouraging to see a young guy (he's in his early '30s) who is going to help keep blues alive for, God-willing, many years to come.    NOTE: Three months later and I am still addicted to this DVD. It just never gets old.
B002VPE1Z2|4.0|At approximately 4\\" wide, 5 1/2\\" tall and 1 1/2\\" deep this little case can hold today's camera or pocket camcorder with little room to spare. When you open the flap the first thing you will see is the zippered pouch. This is big enough to hold spare batteries, memory cards and if you pack carefully a small USB cable. The pocket that holds the camera is well padded front and back. There is a loop on the back of the case to go on a belt. The loop has the option to be opened to make it easier to put the case on the belt. The flap and the loop both use Velcro to keep everything secure.<br /><br />All-in-all this little case has a lot of uses and seems to be very well made.  I recommend it.  :-)
B001JNNDAQ|1.0|if this is the best transfer for a blue ray product the studio shold be ashamed of itself.  I compared it to the original and guess which one was better.

B003TZ9EGO|2.0|The Remix, is okay. I'm not going gaga over it, though. I was expecting more.     Lovegame and Dance In The Dark, are the best out of the ten remixed titles. Like one reviewer on Amazon mentioned, there are better remixes on youtube.    I think there should have been a definitive remix release. The collection seems limited in scope.
B0041T52S6|3.0|This movie is very unique, and quite different than others. It's like a video game world and a comic book world mixed together on live-action film. A lot of the times, it didn't make too much sense, but you just go along for the ride. It's very colorful, and like a crazy acid trip. I'm sure if you grew up in the 80's, you'll absolutely love this film. A bass guitarist for the band \\"Sex Bob-omb\\" named Scott Pilgrim begins to slowly fall in love with a woman named Ramona Flowers. Scott soon learns that he must defeat Ramona's 7 evil exes in order for them to have a relationship together. I'd recommend SCOTT PILGRIM VS. THE WORLD!!!
0060558121|5.0|Shadow is released from prison days early to attend the funeral of his wife. On the way, he is hired to work for Wednesday, a mysterious stranger that wants Shadow to help him recruit the old gods in a war against America's new gods. On a road trip through America and Americana, through cheesy tourist stops and cultural settings, Shadow must deal with his undead wife and the cast of gods, goddesses, and heroes that have immigrated to America in the souls of its people. Gaiman's mythological tale is one part American road trip, one part Joseph Campbell, one part Beatnik poetry, a fascinating and clever blending of the physical, psychological, sociological, cultural, metaphysical, and theological in the American identity. Gaiman's portrait of mythology in a very non-mythological setting perfectly blends the American psychology and the American reality into a brilliant, refreshing and new American Romance novel in the vein of Hawthorne or Melville. The idea that this country of immigrants became a country of immigrating gods and cultural heroes is not only absorbing and original, but beautifully and richly realized. Though not my favorite of Gaiman's novels (it does meander and can be slow at many points), American Gods cements him as one of my most beloved authors. Grade: A-
B002ZG999U|5.0|This was without a doubt one of the best action movies of the year! There was plenty of shooting, killing, fighting, and explosions to satisfy any action fan. Sylvester Stallone and the gang are back with a bloody vengeance. Barney Ross, Lee Christmas, Yin Yang, Gunnar Jensen, Toll Road, and Hale Caesar are a group of elite mercenaries known as the Expendables. Barney is soon asked by the mysterious 'Mr. Church' to take his team on a mission to Vilena to overthrow a brutal dictator named General Garza. Barney and his crew team up with Garza's daughter and also tries to take down James Monroe, who controls the actions of Garza, in exchange for Garza's wealth and fear from his own people. I highly recommend THE EXPENDABLES!!!
B003ITZBVI|5.0|Everybody who's a DC Comics fan knows the stories of the five Robins that have been with Batman.  First was Dick Grayson, who later became Nightwing.  Second was Jason Todd, who was murdered by the Joker.  Third was Tim Drake, who became Red Robin.  Fourth was Stephanie Brown, who is now Batgirl.  And fifth is Damian, the biological son of Batman/Bruce Wayne.  The stories of these five people are unique and a lot of fun to dig into and discuss with fans.  Everybody has a favorite Robin.<br /><br />Batman:  Under the Red Hood is the story of the second Robin - only after he was killed by the Joker and brought back to life by Ras al-Ghul.  Judd Winick wrote the script, based on the Batman arc he wrote that revived Jason Todd, and it serves pretty well, but I know it couldn't do true justice to the whole story.  There's a lot of history in this tale, and all of it worth telling.<br /><br />As far as this direct-to-DVD effort goes, the story can't relate all the years Jason was around after Batman caught him stealing the tires off the Batmobile (something that fans simply couldn't imagine being done even back in the early 1980s).  He lasted for five years before getting killed, and was dead for seventeen years before he was brought back to life.<br /><br />All the fans believed Jason was dead.  After all, didn't DC Comics run a phone contest for fans to decide his fate?  (Right after that, Warner Brothers - the parent company - got hold of DC and asked what they were going to do with the warehouses full of Batman AND Robin products they had to sell!)  So a third Robin was immediately in the offing.<br /><br />Comic heroes are notorious for not staying dead.  Used to we could point at Captain America's sidekick Bucky Barnes and say, see?  Bucky's dead.  Only now Bucky is the new Captain America and Steve Rogers was dead - except that he's now back alive too.<br /><br />Simply put, there's a lot of emotional context and resonance and real-time history missing from the pared-down story on this disc.  However, it is slam-bag full of all things Batman.  First of all, there's lots and lots of action.  And there's a ton of Bat-toys.  Then there's the appearance of Nightwing, Ra's al-Ghul, AND the Joker.<br /><br />There's a lot going on in this movie.  The beginning of the film is gripping, and the assault on Jason Todd/Robin is brutal.  Watching it with my twelve year old was a little hard because I didn't expect that level of intensity.  The Joker was played as perverse and evil, and he stayed that way through the film.  I love how he turned the tables on Blackmask.<br /><br />The art is rendered beautifully.  Loved the explosive action, the detail, and the cityscape.  The world depicted here really felt like Gotham in all its glory and grime.<br /><br />I found the ending a little disappointing, though.  Plenty of questions were raised, and everybody got a look at the heroes' moral compasses, but the main question concerning Batman's relationship with Jason Todd wasn't satisfactorily answered.  Batman makes a choice at the end, but where does he stand after he makes it?<br /><br />I know part of this story is still ongoing in the DC Universe, so the movie is an excellent lure to pull readers into the six-part Red Hood story now being published.  But in these direct-to-DVD adventures, I'd really appreciate a whole story.  This one ends almost where it starts, and we still don't know the true outcome.<br /><br />This Blu-ray disc comes with lots of extras, including two episodes of the original Batman The Animated Series.  These episodes recount the origin of Dick Grayson/Robin, so they're a special treat.  There's also a lot of material (interviews and comic content) depicting Jason Todd's history.  And there's sneak peek of the next DC Comics direct-to-DVD movie, Superman and Batman:  Apocalypse.  The best part, though, is the Jonah Hex short feature written by Joe R.

030726999X|4.0|The story is full of action, lots of unexpected twists and turns, many more characters to keep track of. The writing is straight forward, and is void of personal style which fact is enhanced by the poor translation. So if you are looking for a litterary work of art, this book misses the target. But, if you want to be entertained by an intriguing plot , this book will keep you hooked. The characters are not well developed, but who cares when they do so much, and surprise you with so much information. As for the moralising reader, this book is definitely not for you. The moral standards for intimate or commited relationships in Sweden are very different from the USA. Relationships and expectations between women and men might seem puzzling. View such details as a glimps into Swedish culture (the male boss serving coffee at a meeting; while female journalist works overtime, boyfriend washes the dishes). The author seems to have a need for making a feminist statement over and over. As for Blowmqvist attracting women... it's more that the empowered Swedish woman does not wait for a signal or invite from a man but makes a direct, unmistakable statement or request. I guess romance is not politically correct anymore, or at least the author wants you to believe it.<br /> While I seem to find several short comings of this book, I have to admit that I could not put it down until I finished it.
B001ILFUD2|4.0|For some reason the cover art for this DVD seems to be lower quality than that on other Disney DVDs.  My copy looks slightly fuzzy as if it was printed on a good quality printer rather than embossed and shiny like the covers of other DVDs.
B003HARV3Y|1.0|Created for a younger audience you can understand the sophomoric atmosphere that permeates this film. But the film also has a \\"dumbed down\\" feel that actually becomes irritating. Some have compared this, and even suggested that it competes, with Harry Potter films, I disagree. Harry Potter is: Respectful - even to his enemies. Academic - having a hunger to learn. Humble - confiding with and yielding to his elders and even his peers. Cooperative - working with others to achieve what's best for everyone. Considerate - considers the thoughts and feelings of those around him, even when they are wrong or confused. Although Harry faces tremendous obstacles, including dealing with the loss of his parents, he always displays an air of integrity and honesty that gains him the respect of his elders, peers, and even his enemies.  Percy Jackson is: Disrespectful - to his father and teachers, it's all about Percy, after all he's a child of a god. Inconsiderate - doesn't even consider that his father CANNOT associate with him. Anti-academic - doesn't listen to learned or intelligent people, is torpid in class listening to his music player with a vacuous stare in his eyes (blames dyslexia & ADHD - more pills please). Thief - steals the gold coins from the fountain before knowing they could have belonged to Medusa or not, although that's not a justification. Uses people - Percy and his mother use her \\"boyfriend\\" (his stink) to hide Percy from the gods (what did Percy do when he was away from him). Vengeful and possibly murderous - in an epilogue scene, between the credits, the mother's \\"boyfriend\\" is murdered using the Medusa, knowing full well of his obtrusive nature that he would spring the trap they set for him. These flaws are not only supported and approved of, they are praised (the centaur, played by Pierce Brosnan, shows approval and admiration for Percy's disobedience). Also the basic premise of the film depends on him not obeying and suggests that the only reason to have authority and rules are to disregard them. Although Percy faces tremendous obstacles, he does so in a bumbling, foolhardy, ignorance is bliss kind of way that risks the lives of himself and those around him. Evidently because someone in the heavens is watching over him.  Although gods are ultimately created as a means of control, the Greek gods were also born from a desire to understand and explain nature and man's place in the universe. The gods of today are created to control and dominate nature and man. That is why both suffer so much in our time. The ancient people had already faced the contradictions of most of their beliefs and tried to deal with them. Notice in this film that the gods are very emotional and have many human characteristics like anger, sadness, and petty rivalry. However they are not omniscient, they do not know everything. Zeus, Poseidon, Hades, as well as the other gods have no clue as to where Zeus's Bolt is located.  An omniscient god cannot have emotions. For example, if you came home to find that your spouse has been having an affair. You would become angry or sad because it is new information, something you've now learned. If you had all knowledge there would be nothing for you to learn, you would have known it for as long as you existed. An emotional omniscient god nullifies itself. So an omniscient god repentant of previous actions that eventually destroys everything in a flood because of anger is illogical. Another example is an infinite, perfect, loving god who has no need of anything and therefore could not experience loneliness or lack creating a people knowing that ninety percent will suffer an excruciating torture for an eternity. If you were all-knowing and knew you were going to have ten children but eight or nine of those children would suffer not only in this world but for an eternity in a hell, I doubt you would ever have children. I wouldn't do it if only one of my ten children were to suffer. To experience loneliness and satisfy it knowing that it would cause unimaginable suffering would be the ultimate in selfishness. To be all-loving and do it would be the ultimate in cruelty.  For ages gods have been a perfect way to control people. Simply create a god, then define what [you] the god likes and dislikes and which people to hate or love. Then exploit peoples fears and prejudices, using laws or violence if necessary. And presto! You have control. This is why gods tend to look like or have the characteristics of the people, culture or environment, of those who worship them. Contrary to some popular belief god is actually made in our image.  If all the world decided that we would not acknowledge any god, we would not go to a church, temple, synagogue, etc., there would be little change. If we decided to do the same with money, that we would not buy or sell, the world system would come to a halt. The true god of this world is money. There's a correlation between the fact that the majority of people that believe in a god have less money, are more illiterate, and are therefore more controllable. A very small percentage of people control the wealth of the world and a large portion believe in a god. If I were to ask you to find the closest source of the words \\"In God We Trust\\" where would you suggest? Religion doesn't teach you HOW to think, it teaches you WHAT to think.
B003NHRIVQ|3.0|I enjoy some of Miley Cyrus' work and I appreciate her effort in the entertainment business.  I was neutral going into this movie, didn't form any opinion when I saw the line up of actors and was very excited waiting for this movie.  I have read all of Nicholas Sparks books, this one included and I was thrilled when I saw he was the screenwriter.  However, after watching the movie I can't help but feel disappointed.  The story line fell in the teen/family genre of movies, whereas the book story line would have been appropriate for teens, but also touching and effective for other demo-graphs.  The acting was ok.  Ronnie's Dad was great!  Will was good.  Miley did all right.     *SPOILERS BELOW*      Markus was hardly in the story and the mention of his fire activity was seen briefly, the severity of her father's  illness was downplayed, and the girl Ronnie left behind to be the supportive daughter was hardly understood.  The story was changed a lot, and in doing so,  they went in the wrong direction.  Of course the book is always better in any adaptation, but if you are going to put a  book to screen you should at least follow the story and stick to it.  It would have worked better then what they came up with.  I also thought the music was oddly placed at times and too much of it.    *End Of Spoilers*    I gave this 3 stars because, just like Nights in Rodanthe it brought a book I fell in love with to life in a sense, so because I read the book I can fill the gaps in.  Others I am sorry for you.  Read the book.  If you are looking for a movie like The Notebook, don't look here.  That was a great book adaption.

B0000009SG|4.0|This is another classic from Frank Zappa though somewhat late in his career.  It is impossible to find on iTunes so purchase of the CD was necessary.  The overall misogynistic message is offset by the laser like humor of songs such as \\"I'm the Slime [on Your TV Set]\\" and \\"Montana.\\" Lines like, \\"moving to Montana soon, gonna be a dental floss tycoon,\\" are unforgetable.

B0032FPVKE|4.0|I purchased this camera bag for my GE X5 pro series digital camera. It is about half the size I expected from the pictures, but hold the camera securely in place. I would not suggest this camera for a DSLR camera that you wish to carry additional lenses with. There is not room. I do wish it was a little larger so that I could put my other (smaller) Canon digital camera in the bag with my X5. I am also unable to fit my user manual in this bag, so I hope I never need it when I am away from home! This bag has two side pockets which fit cords nicely. It also has a front pocket that has a velcro flap and zipper to store batteries, memory cards, etc. In short, I wish it were a little larger so I could fit my manual and other camera comfortably, but overall, I am satisfied.
0316067938|2.0|I'm a grown woman and I'll admit it... I'm a Twilight junkie. I read the first three books pretty quickly and then eagerly moved on to the fourth. I began reading Breaking Dawn with no expectations... I hadn't read any reviews or heard anything about the book. I did expect to enjoy it, and it was a good read for a while. The book starts out with the wedding and honeymoon, but we receive no actual details about the honeymoon despite the fact that the previous three books were building up to this very moment. I understand about leaving stuff to the imagination, but how can Meyer spend three books explaining casual touches and kisses in such detail and then say absolutely nothing about the big event? I'm not into trashy romance, but c'mon... they're married now and this is a love story.    Despite the fact that Edward is a vampire and apparently has no body fluids other than venom, Bella somehow gets pregnant almost immediately on their honeymoon. That's where the story went all wrong for me. I actually set the book aside and stopped reading it for a while because I really couldn't see the story ending well after that. Finally, my curiosity got the better of me and I finished the book. Unfortunately, I was right. The story did NOT end well at all, but not for the reasons that I was expecting.    Now, I understand that I'm reading a book about vampires and werewolves, but is a dose of reality to much to ask for? In the real world, Bella would have to make an actual choice... love or motherhood. We are led to believe in the earlier books that she will have to forgo motherhood for the man she loves, which seems like a sacrifice that she is all too willing to make. Then, in Breaking Dawn, we come to find out that she doesn't need to make the sacrifice at all. She gets her man AND the baby. Oh, and Jacob? The guy we spent 3 books feeling bad for? Wait for it... he imprints on Bella's BABY. It's almost like Meyer introduced the pregnancy just to create a \\"happy ending\\" for Jacob too, but it's disturbing on every level.    Meyer lays the groundwork in the first three books... we are told that newborn vampires face real struggles, and we are reminded that Bella's transformation will be incredibly difficult. But is it? No. She adjusts to vampire-hood almost immediately. Let's forget that in Twilight, Edward had been a vampire for 100 YEARS and still almost jumped Bella the first time they met because the smell of her was driving him crazy. Even after a century of \\"abstaining.\\" We are also told that infant vampires are IMPOSSIBLE to control and usually need to be killed. Does that happen to Bella's baby? Of course not. Again, I'm all for taking liberties in a work of fiction, but don't spent three books explaining the rules to us and then break every one of them in the last. That's not a happy ending, it's self-gratification.      I recognize the target audience for this series... but it's almost like Meyer is afraid to expose the truth to teenage girls. Sometimes you have to make sacrifices for love. You can't have your cake and eat it too. Hearts will get broken and difficult decisions will have to be made. There is not always a \\"solution\\" (Bella's baby) to every \\"problem\\" (Jacob). That's life. Again, I know that this is a work of fiction... but Meyer takes what could have been a beautiful love story where real, relatable obstacles are presented, then sidesteps every single one of them. What we're left with is a completely contrived \\"happy ending\\" where no sacrifices have to be made, no one is left disappointed, and Bella doesn't have to give up anything.     All this said, I still loved the series. I just think it ended badly. I would have preferred to see Bella actually have to make the choices and tough decisions that she was set up to make in the first three books. Just because we're dealing with fiction doesn't mean the ending can't be believable.
0679411585|5.0|This is the first book I have read on the Vietnam War. Being from the 60's generation and having watched the war unfold every night on TV, it haunted me as being the most tragic war in our country's history. Last year I visited the Vietnam Memorial and was overwhelmed with emotions for these brave men and women who answered their country's call and died for a war lost. I also had a hard time to view any movies on the Vietnam War but after watching \\"We Were Soldiers\\" I knew I had to read the book and try to understand what these men and families went through and this book did that for me. Being written from the professional soldiers' point of view, it is tragic that the Washington politicians take it upon themselves to run a war from afar while the military recommendations are ignored and how a propros this situation is for today. \\"If we do not learn from our mistakes, we are bound to repeat them\\". Great book!
B002GIBVV6|5.0|I hadn't seen this movie in years, and then I finally watched it again a couple of weeks ago.  I loved it just as much as I did when I was growing up. It really is a very well-done movie, beautifully crafted, with superb acting and a great soundtrack.  Even if the story was slightly changed in some spots from the original book, it was, in my mind, properly faithful to Burnett's masterpiece as I could wish it to be.

B0028IDXDS|5.0|My son loves his Wubbanubs - he has five different ones, the monkey being the first one we got for him. He loves these so much and I love the fact that it is very hard to lose them unlike his regular pacifiers which are always rolling under the furniture or are just hard to see among his toys.    When he was a small infant, these were the only pacifiers he could keep in his mouth, because he could hold the stuffed animal part. That was a lifesaver for me because I didn't have to constantly give him back his pacifier when he woke up. Now that he is older, he doesn't need the stuffed animal part to help keep it in his mouth, but he loves the various animals he has. We are slowly trying to wean him off his pacifiers, but it is hard to refuse him his \\"wubbas\\" (as we call them) because he absolutely beams when he sees them.    The wubbanubs are very easy to clean and they have been very durable. I highly recommend Wubbanubs!

B00005K3NR|5.0|Carrie (1976) is one of the more unique horror films, based on the novel by Stephen King.  It has a down-to-earth feel to it, with the upcoming high school prom and a girl named Carrie White (played by Sissy Spacek) who is always being picked on by her classmates.  Carrie White possesses telekinetic powers that few people know about.  Her mother, played by Piper Laurie, is a religious fanatic who is extremely strict with her daughter, even to the point of physical abuse.  Carrie grows to hate her mother as time goes on.  This movie suddenly makes a sharp left turn and goes from being basically a teeny bopper high school prom movie to a horror movie filled with blood and destruction.  This movie can be summed up like this:  It is a movie about getting ultimate revenge on the people who have hurt you both physically and mentally.<br /><br />Spacek and Laurie both received Academy Award nominations for their roles.  This movie also stars John Travolta as a partying slacker named Billy Nolan who is in on the ultimate prank against Carrie White in this movie.  It also stars William Katt as Tommy Ross, who is Carrie's prom date, and PJ Soles as Norma Watson.<br /><br />In my opinion, the best performances were by Sissy Spacek and Piper Laurie, the two Academy Award-nominated actresses.<br /><br />This DVD has good special features, including a documentary called \\"Acting Carrie\\" with Sissy Spacek, Amy Irving, Betty Buckley, etc., and a documentary called \\"Visualizing Carrie\\" with director Brian DePalma.  There is also a featurette called \\"Carrie The Musical\\", an animated photo gallery, and a biography called \\"Stephen King And The Evolution\\".<br /><br />This movie has good special effects for its time.  I highly recommend this movie to all horror movie fans.  A must see.
B000F2C7TU|4.0|`Lovehunter' continued the blues rock journey of David Coverdale and his cohorts in Whitesnake. In what would be an absolute anomaly in a few short years, consecutive LP's were recorded with the exact same lineup! I find `Lovehunter' to be no real improvement on `Trouble' which just means it is just as good; not groundbreaking, just good solid heavy blues. \\"Walking in the Shadow of the Blues\\" is along with \\"Trouble\\" and \\"Come On\\" probably my favorite early Whitesnake song. The passion of the vocal and Bernie Marsden's brilliant guitar solo make this easily an album highlight. Others include the title track, which was a slide showpiece for Micky Moody, the band's co-lead guitarist, \\"Long Way from Home\\" (the first single which didn't fare all that well), \\"Rock and Roll Women\\" and the brief but stunning closer \\"We Wish You Well\\".  Again much of the album is very hit or miss, like `Trouble' but I find it enjoyable all the same. The original Whitesnake would soon hit their peak with their next release but you could much worse than `Lovehunter'; doosy of an album cover too!

0780018664|4.0|M, 1931 film<br /><br />The film begins with children playing a counting game in the country that gave us Grimm's Fairy Tales. [You know the origin of \\"Ring around a Rosy\\"?] We see the furnishings in an apartment. A stranger approaches Elsie Beckman on the street. Newsboys sell an Extra edition. Eight children were killed already! Who is the murderer? Suspicions arise among friends. They print a copy of the killer's letter. [Recognize the handwriting?] The police compare the fingerprints, a graphologist studies the writing to decipher the personality of the writer. Clues are found at the murder scene. The people are terrorized by an unknown murderer. The witnesses give conflicting testimony. A red or green hat? The police search everywhere for clues. They raid the hangouts of criminals and check their papers. This is bad for their business, it keeps customer away.<br /><br />Three men wait for a meeting. Schranker is the best crook between Berlin and San Francisco. The heads of the gangs must do something about this situation. They must eliminate the child murderer. The police plan their strategy too. Can the public help with valid clues? The problem in these crimes is the lack of any prior connection between the victim and the murderer. [Still true for serial murderers.] This murderer leaves no clues. The police decide the murderer must have a record somewhere, they just have to search for a \\"harmless man\\" who has this personality. The gang leaders decide to watch the children. The beggars can do it, they are always on the streets. The police go through all the records of those released in the last five years. A man from \\"Finanz Amt\\" calls on Herr Beckert, but he just went out. We see Beckert on the street. He whistles a tune. He smokes \\"Ariston\\" cigarettes.<br /><br />A blind man hears someone whistling a tune and remembers something. He calls Heinrich to warn him and tell him to follow this man. Heinrich cleverly puts a mark on his shoulder! It is discovered by the little girl. Men follow him, but he disappears. The police wait in the empty apartment. The gang leaders have a plan: they will search the building themselves. One man hears a noise in the attic. They find Beckert. The alarm goes off, the gangsters flee. One man is left behind; he is \\"innocent\\" and knows nothing. Why did they search the entire building from the coal cellar to the storage attic? Franz talks: \\"Die Kinder M&ouml;rder\\".<br /><br />The gangs are at an abandoned brewery building. The blind man identifies Beckert. The crowd calls for death. Then they laugh at him. Beckert says he has no choice over what he does. The voices in his head tell him to kill. A compulsive murderer must be snuffed out like a candle. Does this compulsion absolve him of the murders? The jury says no. But the authorities arrive to stop the people from carrying out a lynching. Next we see a court passing judgment. This won't bring the children back. A mother says we should keep a closer watch on the children. [The story ends here, was something eliminated like the trial and condemnation? I think about 5-10 minutes of scenes were deleted.]<br /><br />This film is in German with English subtitles. It shows life in a German city (Berlin?) around 1931. There is no mention of the Great Depression that hit Germany the hardest, or the political turmoil that would lead to a Second World War. This story is unlike any film in 1930s America. Wasn't this film based on a true crime? 'The Changeling' is another drama on this subject.

0307594777|4.0|For a long time, I'd been hearing the hype about Stieg Larsson's Millenium Trilogy, but never took the plunge to buy/read them.  Finally, after receiving a strong recommendation from a person whose opinion I respected, I bought the first book, \\"The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo\\".  It concerns a Mikael Blomkvist, a disgraced publisher/journalist who is hired by a retired industrialist to find out what happened to his beloved great-niece over 30 years before.  Eventually he is assisted by Lisbeth Slander, a pierced, tattooed person who does background checks for a security company.  Lisbeth is a deep, complex character with many secrets.<br /><br />After reading the first book, which except for a bit of a slow start, was a great read, I ordered and read the second and third books, the major plot of which is Lisbeth's being accused of a triple murder and Mikael's efforts to prove her innocence, despite some small inner doubts.<br /><br />Overall, I give the trilogy four stars; I'd rate the first book as 5 stars, the second as a strong 4 star, and the third somewhere between 3 and 4 stars.  The second book was weaker only in comparison to the first book, partly because Mikael, and to a greater extent, Lisbeth, were so refreshingly new in the first book.  I found the third book to be the weakest in the trilogy, hampered by a lot of seemingly pointless meandering and dry sections in the early/middle portions of the 630 page book.  However, the last 125 pages or so are very strong and wraps up most of the loose ends from the earlier books.<br /><br />According to articles I've read, Mr Larsson apparently intended for there to be 10 novels in the Millennium series, and before his untimely death in 2004, he purportedly had written about ¾ of the fourth novel.  However the three published novels are self-contained and don't leave you feeling as if there is anything unfinished.<br /><br />On a side note, I've decided my next career should be as a Swedish journalist, rather than a as sports star or rock singer, as Mikael Blomkvist the journalist is irresistible to the women he meets in the novels.  Who knew journalists were so popular? :-) (Yes, Mr Larsson himself was a journalist.)<br /><br />Anyway, if you're interested in murder mystery thrillers, I strongly recommend these books.r, as Mikael Blomkvist the journalist is irresistible to the women he meets in the novels.

B000B8QEZG|5.0|Okay, so I'm officially tardy to the party, but that's okay too. Since I have written reviews for all of Madonna's albums many years ago, I figure I should write reviews for her most recent albums as well. So, here is my review of 2005's \\"Confessions On A Dance Floor.\\" As much as it pains me to say this in hindsight since I am such a huge fan of Madonna, this wasn't one of my favorite Madonna albums when it first came out. I guess I was expecting \\"American Life Part II\\" or something. I honestly loved (still love) \\"American Life,\\" and I think I was in my \\"I can only like serious non-dance music\\" phase or something. What was wrong with me? Well, I've outgrown that, and this album has seriously grown on me in the past few years. But enough about me, onto the music! This is from start to finish a stellar dance record. Madonna teams with Stewart Price, and they create magic, plain and simple. I've heard this album described as \\"ABBA on drugs, \\" which I think fits. The album starts of with a bang with the classic song \\"Hung Up,\\" and just keeps going. Madonna  and Stuart Price's decision to sample ABBA's \\"Gimme Gimme Gimme (A Man After Midnight)\\" was a stroke of pure genius.  I think they also sampled Donna Summer's \\"I Feel Love\\" in the song \\"Future Lovers.\\" Throughout the album the melodies are genius, and Madonna is in top vocal form, and truly in her element. Honestly, this album has not aged a day since November 2005. In my case, it's only gotten better with time. I now rank it a very cushy sixth on my list of Madonna's albums. Now, that's pretty darn good.  This is truly a must own. Buy it, and get ready to hit the dance floor!    1. Hung Up: This song is classic Madonna. Wonderful sample of the ABBA song, and Madonna's vocals make it pure pop perfection. Just classic! (5/5)    2. Get Together: I didn't like this song a lot at first, but it has seriously grown on me. (4.5/5)    3. Sorry: I like this song a lot. It's very fun and catchy. (5/5)    4. Future Lovers: I freaking LOVE this song! Madonna's vocals and the melody push it over the top. I love the way Madonna sings the lyric \\"In the evidence of its brilliance.\\" Perfection! (5/5)    5. I Love New York: Not Madonna's best song lyrically, but her attitude and sass make it fun. The \\"Confessions Tour\\" version is better in my opinion, though. (4.5/5)    6. Let It Will Be: This a really good song, and I like it a lot. (4.5/5)    7. Forbidden Love: This is another really good song, and Madonna sings it very well. Madonna also had a song on her 1994 \\"Bedtime Stories\\" album called \\"Forbidden Love\\" which I honestly preferred, though. (4.5/5)    8. Jump: This is another classic Madonna song. Great throbbing beat, and Madonna's vocals are fantastic. (5/5)    9. How High: I've always really liked this song. I think the melody is great. (4.5/5)    10. Isaac: This song has really grown on me over time. It is quite catchy. (4/5)    11. Push: This is my least favorite song on the album. It's good, just not my favorite. (3.5/5)    12. Like It Or Not: This is a very good song, and a great way to close the album. The lyrics are especially strong in my opinion. (4.5/5)    Overall: (4.54/5)
0307454541|1.0|Wow. What an original idea. A story about raping and torturing women.  The book starts off entertainingly enough. Lots of detail about Sweden, good character development, two concurrent themes. Over the next 50% of the book it devolves into a murder mystery of the most grotesque crimes. A woman is murdered by stuffing her head into a fire. Bodies are dismembered. A father teaches his son how to rape a woman, torture her, then murder her. Really Stieg. That's your award winning idea? Sadly this theme has become boring instead of shocking. 30 years ago this book would have pushed the limits of social acceptability. 20 years ago it would have led the \\"disgusting murder\\" genre. 10 years ago it was tedious. Presently, it's outdated, been done a million times, and boring. If you want to write a book and you can't come up with something original, run to the rape/murder theme.  Stieg ruins a great setup.  Have you ever read a murder mystery? Then you've read this book. There are much fresher ideas out there.

B002VPE1XE|4.0|This is a small bag which fits items such as a digital cameral of moderate size. Mine is used for a Canon A560, which is an average size point and shoot. The bag fits the camera easily, with about 1/4 to 1/2 inch of space remaining. It isn't a snug fit but, then again, it is soft inside so I am not worried about the camera \\"rattling\\" around.     It is thinner than I expected and much softer. Maybe 1/8\\" of padding and very flexible. This is good in that it makes it easy to pack into another bag, but it is of limited protection for larger impacts, such as falls. There is a pocket on the front for storage.    As a prior reviewer mentioned, the velcro closure is sewn on at an odd angle, it looks like they don't have their quality control there just yet, and perhaps that is because this is a review sample.    There is also a velcro loop on the back for attaching it to something (a belt?), but I wouldn't trust that as you are relying on the velcro directly instead of the usual setup where velcro is used doubled-over on itself. It seems to me that the way they have it, the velcro would easily peel away during use.    It is frustration free packaging (and I'm sure this isn't typical) but this small, soft, padded thing came in a box maybe 2\\"x3\\"x4\\" within a much larger box maybe 24\\"x18\\"x12\\", filled with brown paper. Lots to recycle from this one purchase (but it was easy to open!). It could have been mailed in a padded envelope.
B00127RAJY|3.0|I've had this video since last year. I was in tip top shape last year, and when I deviated a little for a month or so, I used this 30 day shred to kick start...which worked great! HOWEVER, now that it's been a good 6-7 since I've even seen the gym (school, career, new house = time pressures/stress)I've not noticed much of a difference even though I've stuck with it for a while! The workouts ARE good and definitely get you going and, most importantly, feeling satisfied after you finish.     My biggest complaint though is that these workouts are NOT good for people who have bad/weak knees. I've always had knee problems and today, I'm having a hard time. I did read a review on a different fitness program where the reviewer mentioned 30 day shred and said that though she liked the video, she tore her meniscus in her knee. So, I think I'm going to have to find something different. :(
080701429X|5.0|I have read this book many, many times. These are the words I live by. If I was told that I could only own one book for the rest of my life, this would be it. Viktor Frankl's harrowing testimony of surviving in a concentration camp seems incomprehensible. Even more unbelievable is the attitude he adopts during his struggle as he remains apart from his family, starving, cold, and forced to perform hard labor with no relief in sight. Through it all, he decides that even though his body is being held captive, he is still free to control his mind and his attitude.     When he is ultimately liberated from the concentration camp, rather than be bitter and remorseful, he uses his tragic experiences as a basis for logotherapy, a counseling theory that helps people to find meaning in their adversity. He also influences a generation of existential psychotherapists including another favorite writer of mine, Irvin Yalom. This is an incredible book that significantly altered my life and way of thinking. I recommend it to everyone.
B0001MDP3G|5.0|2003's \\"Cold Mountain\\" tells the story of Confederate soldier Inman (Jude Law) who deserts after the Battle of the Crater debacle to return to the mountains of Western North Carolina and his one true love, Ada (Nicole Kidman). Inman experiences many different people, events and obstacles on his long journey home, while Ada has her own problems to deal with -- someone's death, the BEG (Blatantly Evil Guy) who has taken over the town with his ruthless cohorts, starvation/poverty, a house and farm she doesn't know how to run, that is, until Ruby (Ren&eacute;e Zellweger) comes along and gives a hand, and more.<br /><br />As you can see, the film essentially tells two stories that ultimately intertwine. The plot is reminiscent of Homer's Odyssey. In light of Inman's long journey home the film is episodic in nature but thankfully never loses its sense of cohesion.<br /><br />The story shows how the war destroyed or corrupted the South on practically every level, not just the soldiers who went off to fight, die, be maimed, desert or suffer defeat, but everyone left behind as well. Every person Inman meets on his journey is somehow damaged or corrupted because of the war.<br /><br />For example, in the case of the family in the large cabin (which also includes the wife's two lonely sisters) the husband's friendliness is a greedy and deceitful ruse to make money off the deserters. All the eligible men have gone to war and those who return are maimed and scarred. Is it any wonder the women are love-starved and try to lose themselves in drunkenness and casual sex?<br /><br />As for the overt sexuality of that sequence, I think the writer and filmmakers were attempting to contrast the drunken carnal lust of that scene (including the two sisters upstairs with the looney guy) with an intimate love scene later in the story.<br /><br />The scenes noted above, particularly the former, are very adult-oriented, so be forewarned. This sequence and the immoral and looney \\"Reverend\\" Veasey (Philip Seymour Hoffman) may tempt some tune out and judge the film as unwholesome or even \\"anti-Christian\\", but this is a premature judgment in light of the entire story and particularly the ending. Not everyone can handle \\"Cold Mountain\\" because of its hardcore depiction of the horrors of war, madness and immorality, I understand this, but it's not all death, misery and darkness; these are effectively balanced out by the beauty of life, love, loyalty, companionship, poetry and music.<br /><br />The film was shot in Virgina, South Carolina and the Carpathian Mountains, Romania, the latter of which are good stand-ins for the mountains of North Carolina.<br /><br />\\"Cold Mountain\\" runs 2 and a half hours and it's just a very well done film on every level, in many ways great. Don't miss out if you haven't seen it; and if you have, be sure to give it another look -- it's worth it as it's full of treasures to mine on repeat viewings.<br /><br />GRADE: A-tune out and judge the film as unwholesome or even \\"anti-Christian\\", but this is a premature judgment in light of the entire story and particularly the ending.

B003JTHESA|3.0|Unlike a comment I read here about the diversity of Iron Maiden, I beg to differ. Although I absolutely adore this band, I cannot necessarily praise the \\"variety\\" of their catalog of songs. In fact, one of the reason I love Iron Maiden is because they ALWAYS keep the same style of music. Always. I mean, I love when a band wants to try something new or go in a different direction. But I also appreciate it when a group has defined their own style and wants to keep it that way. When you buy an album by the likes of Iron Maiden or let's say, ACDC or Bryan Adams, you know immediately what you're getting into. There's nothing wrong with that. It's kind of comforting. Like an old friend you go and visit.     With Iron Maiden, you can listen to \\"Piece Of Mind\\" (1983) and \\"Brave New World\\" (2000) and you wont really notice a difference. If anything, you'll be able to notate a better quality in the more technical aspects of the recordings but in terms of style, nope. The passage of time hasn't modified their musical trend a bit. Nor has it affected their lyrics.     With that in mind, I kept reading that \\"The Final Frontier\\" would mark a change. That it would be different. That we would see a new face of the band. Of course, I was curious but at the same time, I was apprehensive, to say the least. Cause it would then mean that what I loved about them was about to come to an halt.  I want U2 to change. I want Madonna to reinvent herself each time she puts an album out. But with Maiden, it's not the same. I want them to stay the same. Some bands, you don't want them to change (Def Leppard, Bon Jovi...) and when they do, it's like a piece of your childhood that's forever gone.    Well I rest assure. \\"The Final Frontier\\", to me, is the good old Iron Maiden all over again. I don't see what the fuss is all about. Am I so musically illiterate that I don't see the difference? I swear, all the songs sound just like any other album they've made in the past. Where some saw an evolutionwithin their musical construction, I saw hints of old songs like \\"Infinate Dreams\\", \\"Ghost Of The Navigator\\", \\"Bring Your Daughter... To The Slaughter!\\", \\"The Pilgrim\\" or \\"Hooks In You\\". The intro of the first song is in the same continuity as let's say, \\"Moonchild\\" or \\"Seventh Son Of  Seventh Son\\" (the song). The songs are just longer, that's all. But then again, their songs are most always very long. Nope. Really, it's the same old band to me.     And their lyrics are the same. So are their song titles. \\"The Final Frontier\\", \\"The Alchemist\\", \\"El Dorado\\", \\"Isle Of Avalon\\", \\"The Talisman\\"... those are typical Maiden titles you expect to read on a back of one of their CDs. When I listen to Bruce on this new album, I hear him sing about a man who is scared of the future or the unknown but who's also willing to face it. It's the same with a lot of the previous songs (\\"The Loneliness Of The Long Distance Runner\\", \\"Infinite Dreams\\", \\"Hallowed Be Thy Name\\", etc...).    But one thing that could undo or discredit all of the above is the fact that to me, \\"El Dorado\\" is the best song on this new CD. At least, the most commercial one. The most accessible. The most likely to go on a compilation. Whereas I keep reading that it's one the weakest.     So there you are. Make of it what you will. To me, Iron Maiden is the same. \\"The Final Frontier\\" is no more different than all of their previous albums. And \\"El Dorado\\", without being their best song, is most definitely the \\"Wasted Years\\" or the \\"Run To The Hills\\" of this new CD.     Like we all say in the club, \\"Up The Irons!\\"
1594744475|5.0|This book is so adorable! When I opened up the package and saw the book, I was amazed! The book looks way better irl than in the tiny picture on amazon! Big and clear full-page pictures are on almost every other page, and there are lots and lots of recipes I've yet to try. The book is very useful to me; I am glad I bought it. It serves more as an inspirational book for me rather than a recipe book though.
B000068IEU|4.0|This is a movie that was remade and was horrible.  Nothing beats an original. This is a movie that you will be scare for your life and think twice about where you live and what could actually happen. To remake a Wes Craven movie is horrible.  This movie made me sick but in a way that is good. If you get that then you'll buy this movie.   I really can't say much about this movie except... What the Hell!
B0001US8FI|5.0|It was sent to me in great condition for a good price, and of course the movie is a classic!
B00026WU64|4.0|As I kind of mental exercise, I recently tried imagining listening to this record as though it were 1963.  It wasn't as easy as all that.  I WAS alive in '63, but I was 10 years old and only vaguely aware of the \\"Great Folk Scare\\" that was taking root at the time.  I would go on to get into Dylan in a big way as a teenager, but that was the ELECTRIFIED Dylan.  The early stuff seemed like something to be respected, even revered, but even though no one could deny the strength of \\"Blowin' In the Wind\\" or its rightful place in music history: even if you thought \\"Highway 61\\" was way cooler.  So re-listening to FREEWHEELIN' and pretending it was totally fresh and I had no idea who Bob Dylan was going to become in a few years and the significance he'd take on, well, it was a challenge.    But it did yield an apercu or two.  The Dylan I came to know and love as a teen in the late 60s sang with an audible sneer.  The Dylan I wasn't listening to as a pre-teen sang (relatively) sweet and sincere.  Yeah, the vocals are rough in an almost sweetly self-conscious way.  It's the voice of an earnest young man--albeit one with a sense of humor--who venerates his musical forebears.  But you can tell that he's also seeking to find his own voice.  It's easy to imagine the excitement that his very apparent musical development had to have generated.  His first album had only a couple of original tunes, neither truly great.  This record had not only \\"Blowin' In the Wind,\\" but \\"Masters of War,\\" \\"A Hard Rain\\" and \\"Don't Think Twice.\\"  AND the truly lovely \\"Girl From the North Country\\"--which strategically placed as the album's second track, proved that the young songwriter could be as tender as he was tough and acerbic.    And if you CAN begin to listen to \\"Blowin' In the Wind\\" with new ears, you may find yourself agreeing that this is THE best version ever recorded.  Now, I've always aligned myself with the camp that says nobody does Dylan like Dylan, but I'm not sure that I always believedthat.  There were several lovely versions of \\"Wind\\" by more polished singers that helped sell the song to the masses as the anthem that it would become.  But even though I give Baez and PP&M their due as popularizers, I've come to realize that even if no one else had recorded or performed the tune, Dylan's version alone would have been enough to ensure its status as a classic.  His vocal is achingly sincere on this track.  There's none of the world-weariness that would later come to characterize his vocals.  He's that good, and that touching.    Dylanophiles will tell you that every track the master recorded is significant in some way, and strictly speaking, that's true.  Nat Hentoff's notes give every track on the album its due, and his observations--like those of many other critics and commentators--can be insightful  Nevertheless, I'm going to commit a minor heresy (among Dylan fans anyway) and say that for most contemporary listeners--and for many in 1963--there's a fair amount of filler on Dylan's second studio release.  All those talking blues numbers seem dated and often a bit silly now.  And even when I play my \\"time machine\\" game,  I find it hard to believe that even his most adoring fans got particularly excited over \\"I Shall Be Free,\\" a title that promises so much, but devolves into silliness about \\"makin' love to Elizabeth Taylor\\" and \\"catching hell from Richard Burton.\\"  Yes, they were in the news in '62, but since these are actually the very last lines on the record, they reduce an otherwise enduring album into an inevitable period curio.  In short, a mistake.    The silliness was doubtless even a response to Dylan's own budding genius.  If people were appropriately blown away by \\"Blowin' In the Wind\\" and \\"Masters of War,\\" the young poet, and certainly his handlers, must have thought that providing a leavening touch of whimsy and humor was a good idea.  In principle, it was, but that's the material that hasn't aged so well.    One \\"minor\\" track that has aged well though is the young songwriter's thoughtful meditation on the aging process itself and the attendant loss of youthful optimism, friendships and \\"fun,\\" \\"Bob Dylan's Dream.\\"  Oddly enough, this is one of three \\"dream songs\\" on the album and the only one that is not surreal and dreamlike in itself.  It is also, along with \\"North Country,\\" Bob Dylan at his most tender and sincere.  It's a song well worth re-discovering.
B003JTHESA|5.0|Hi! I got Mission Edition CD!  The album needs to be really LISTENED and not just blamed because of prejudices and false expectations.    Yes it is a complex album, yes the songs are a bit more longer than the so-known classics. I hate to criticize others opinion mostly because all should be recived with respect and an open mind, but I feel shame of those \\"metal-heads\\" that in order to enjoy an Iron Maiden album it must be \\"monstruously-fast-and-full-of-anger-killer-riffs\\"; Maiden are not those 30 years old youngs anymore, they have been mauturing along with their music style, and that's something I really appreciate: they have PROGRESSED.    For me, A Matter of Life & Death is the best IM album I've heard, Why!? Well, it is full of layers, solid composition, constructive lyrics and of course a great fusion of Progressive Rock & Heavy Metal.    About The Final Frontier: It's very early to say, but it will be on my IM top 3 records!  The precious stone of the album is indeed The Man Who Would be King; never heard before so much different styles & new musical territories on one single song.  Now, I'm going to listen it all again on my stereo room!
B000F4LPJ6|5.0|Finally a movie that is as hardcore as ever. It grabbed me in a way that made me excited (makes no sence). But anyways this is seriosuly a movie that actually delivers. You nknow how movies say \\"You'll be at the edge of your seat\\"? Well this movie actually promises you will.  It became one of my favorites movies over night and its seriously going down as a classic. I do recommend this movie hardcore status!  And this movie brings a message that is awesome. Figure out what it is.  \\"Who could you really trust\\"?  -JP
B003OF3R0S|2.0|Let me start by saying that City of Evil was the first A7x cd that I'd ever heard. I loved it. Then I went back and listened to Waking the Fallen and I loved that too. Then Soundin the 7th Trumpet and I liked it but not as much as the other 2. Then I heard the self titles was coming out. I was excited but was somewhat let down because it was only ok. I didn't hate it but it wasn't nearly as good as their previous 2 cds. As everyone know by now, The Rev died last December. This is very sad for every fan of the band and even moreso for the band itself. When I heard that a Nightmare would be released just 8 months after the Rev died, I was concerned. I felt that they could only take a step in the wrong direction, or (best case scenario) match their self titled with another decent cd. Unfortunately they didn't do a lot right in this cd. I listened to the first 2 songs and thought \\"Maybe I was wrong and this will be good.\\". My original fears were correct though. I can honestly say that I like 5 songs on this cd. Nightmare, Welcome to the Family, Natural Born Killer, God Hates Us, and Save Me. The other 6 are mediocre in every sense of the word and in some cases flat out unbearable. I'm very glad I listened to the cd before I bought it so I didn't waste 10 bucks. A7x needs to decide if they are going to have a borderline rock/ metal sound or the boring music on the rest of the cd. By boring I mean absolutely no emphasis on instruments and all emphasis on M. Shadow's voice. He has a good voice for rock/ metal but not a voice that can stand alone which happens alot on this cd. There is nothing groundbreaking here. Avenged Sevenfold just took another step into the mainstream and an even bigger step into mediocrity.
B002MXA4UO|5.0|Been a HUGE SD fan since the very early days. I even saw them play an acoustic set at a local CD store way back before they really made it big. Now to see where they are with thier 3rd album, it's incredible. I told my friends back when we saw that acoustic perfomance (about a few weeks after they released their debut album Leave a Whipser) that this was going to be a HUGE rock band at some point and they were going to be headlining tours all across the world. Well I was right, they have become one of the more successful rock bands of the past decade and they have done it by following one simple plan: MAKE THE MUSIC THE FANS WANT AND STAY TRUE TO YOUR ROOTS! They haven't sold out like alot of bands. They don't make the music just to get it on the radio. They  make the music the fuels the fire in their souls and it's completely evident on all of their albums, but especially so on The Sound of Madness. You won't find a song on this album that wouldn't be a #1 hit. They raised the bar so high with this album! And the bonus songs on the newer released version are so good, it made me RE-buy the CD (I got the original release the day it came out) when I noticed they added some bonus tracks that were only downloadable with the full \\"Deluxe\\" version download. 100% worth it. You will not be disappointed. And on a different note, if you have a chance to see them live, DO IT! Seen them 8 times and they are one of the best performing rock bands of the last decade!

B000001ELD|4.0|I bought this album when I was 8, because it was Kiss, and I bought everything that was Kiss. However, over the years I kept finding mysself drawn back to various tunes because they kept running through my head.   Now, at 40, I can honestly say that this is one of those \\"ahead of its time\\" albums.     \\"Radioactive\\" has that really weird beginning of mysterious voices and what sounds like a UFO landing. This is one of the songs that sounds closest to Kiss. The rest of the album veers between light rock/funk and disturbingly sweet ballads that work better than the ones on Paul Stanley's or Peter Criss' solos.     \\"Living In Sin\\" -- if it had been made by any other artist -- in particular, could have been a hit in the 70s, with it's Village-People-like-chorus, and a breakdown featuring Cher on the phone. It's a lot of fun. \\"True Confessions\\" is in the same vein.     Songs like \\"Tunnel of Love\\" \\"See You in Your Dreams\\" \\"See You Tonite\\" -- any of these, again, could have been hits if done by one of the singer-songwriters of the era.     Part confessional, part classic AM-radio cheese, part rock and roll...It's all Gene. The second-best Kiss solo album -- Ace's is the best -- it deserves a second listen.
0547258305|5.0|A very beautiful story that makes you instantly fall in love with not only the people, but the world that they live in, as well. This story takes you into its grasps and holds you tightly until the end. The thing that I loved about this story was that it was easy to visualize and understand this story, even though it was set in a place that was complicated and well-developed. I reccomend this book for everybody in high school and up. Enjoy...

B0035YPIJG|2.0|The quilt itself is absolutely beautiful.  The up-close color photos of the individual squares are very helpful in choosing colors and fabrics for the quilt.  The frustrating part is that each pattern piece, not the pattern for the entire block, is located on a pdf file on the CD and there are no dimensions. For example, the Attic Windows block is comprised of two of the #2 pdf file, two of the #14 pdf file, one of the #1 file, and two of the #3 file so you have to print seven pages (they recommend not copying the printed pieces because they may be distorted). The Shooting Star block requires multiples of eleven different pattern pieces. There are a total of 106 different pdf files for the pattern pieces so it is is more like 111 jigsaw puzzles than quilt blocks. The book recommends that you print all 106 files and put them in a 3-ring binder. Another suggestion is to copy them onto plastic templates and write the number on each one. Because there are no dimensions, you are forced to print a simple square or rectangle unnecessarily when you could have just measured it on the fabric if you knew what size it was.  The value of the book is in the history of the quilt and in the color photos of the block.  The instruction (or lack thereof) to recreate the quilt is poor.
B000OZ0NXA|3.0|This book read in 3 parts to me \\"great \\" (the beginning)- then \\"good\\" (the middle) - then \\"so-so\\" (the end.) The style of the book draws you in quickly and the writing is pretty solid throughout. The problem with the book comes in the high number of coincidences that are a little too convenient in a book that seems a bit more intelligent than a typical thriller. The book has it's fun and suspenseful moments and I think that it makes for a great set-up for the character and I'm interested in getting caught up on the other books in the series.    Overall it's a good read, but I definitely hope that the future installments don't underwhelm the reader with too many convenient ties to some of the plot lines. I would recommend the book for anyone who was looking to start a series of books because I believe that this was a good launching pad for an exciting character. For anyone looking for a \\"one-off\\" book to read, lower your expectations and just take the ride for what it's worth.
B002ZG99CC|3.0|To me, the first \\"Karate Kid\\" movie is \\"Mr. Miyagi and his Apprentice.\\" The story of the 1984 hit movie is predictable and Ralph Macchio and his karate fight scenes look disappointingly amateurish, but Noriyuki 'Pat' Morita, Oscar-nominated as a wise karate teacher, is fun throughout, and the master-pupil relation between Miyagi sensei and Macchio's young hero Daniel is convincing and touching.    Now after three not-so-great sequels (including one starring then unknown Hilary Swank), a remake arrives with Jaden Smith as Dre Parker, a new kid in a Beijing school, and Jackie Chan as Mr. Han, a quiet maintenance man who teaches martial arts to the bullied boy. Probably the new \\"Karate Kid\\" movie should be called \\"The Kung-fu Kid\\" as karate is hardly mentioned in the film, but this is not really a big problem. Beautifully shot in China and professionally choreographed, the remade \\"Karate Kid\\" is overall enjoyable, but is deeply flawed and weak in many regards.    Though the friendship between the two main characters Dre and Mr. Han is credible, and Jackie Chan's acting itself is very good, Chan's Mr. Han lacks a sense of humor that lends depth to the character of Miyagi. One subplot about Dre's love story, devoid of chemistry, only slows down the pace of the 140 minute film, which is too long by 40 minutes. Occasional attempt at humor are weak at best, but if you have seen any of director Harald Zwart's unimpressive works in the past (\\"Agent Cody Banks\\" \\"The Pink Panther 2\\"), you will not be surprised at that.    The martial art tournament sequence is acceptable, though wires and stunts are obviously used. Jackie Chan also gives one amusing fight scene against the bullying boys, almost stealing the film from Jaden Smith.    This is not a bad remake. Only that it needs a new title and a tighter story.
B002VPE1B6|1.0|People have been stating that \\"Avatar\\" is THE new great movie and blabbering on that it has changed the face of cinema. If this is the new face of cinema, I do not believe I will be venturing to the movie theatre any time soon.     Spoilers Ahead!    Avatar is a crap movie. The whole story line is a ripoff of Disney's Pocahontas. Character for character Avatar mimics the story. For instance, Jake Sully, a man who goes to another planet or another world to exploit the land but falls in love with the Cheif's daughter, is obviously John Smith. They even have the same initials. Most of the characters in Avatar are exactly the same people is Disney's Pocahontas. It is ridiculous! The only main difference the Native Americans in this movie are blue aliens in a different time period. How creative James Cameron!    That is not my only problem with this movie. It may be visually stunning but the plot was just so obvious what would happen that the movie was just plain boring. I didn't buy the love story in it at all. The only character I did like, the Colonel, dies in the end. He killed his own people to save a tree. Ughhhhhhhhhhhhh.......    I'm a huge science fiction lover and I should have enjoyed this movie. But I really didn't. If you're the kind of person who enjoys story lines and interesting characters, do not buy this movie. Go buy Disney's Pocahontas, it at least has lovely musical numbers.
0446693804|5.0|Nicholas Sparks is one of my favorite authors.  A Walk To Remember is one of the best books he has written.  It is not too long, so it is good for just cuddling up in a big overstuffed chair on a rainy day.  It would also be an excellent book for a reading group because, unlike most books, it has questions for discussion by a group or to ponder on your own.  This is a very good read and I would recommend it to anyone from teenagers to senior adults.
1592289444|4.0|Well i read the book, i enjoyed it.  I just am not sure about what i am now reading about  the validity of it. Either way, read it and enjoy it.
0553801473|2.0|Once again we see another major writer joining the likes of Robert Jordan and Piers Anthony whose early triumphant books hooked us into suffering later unimaginative novels with no internal plots which creep the epic story arc in soap opera fashion. This book accomplished little other than shuffling the locations of the characters a bit, creating more Targaryens (how many do we really need?), and killing off another Stark (he keeps him alive for 4 books THEN kills him?).  Dance with Dragons had no internal story arc and nothing even resembling an ending.<br /><br />At the pace Martin is going he will take at least 3 more books to finish the Ice and Fire storyline, and at 4 years per novel, he should take a lesson from Robert Jordan: STOP working on other writings , prequels, and game systems or your epic may outlive your own lifespan.

1401207529|4.0|Batman:Year One is a story, which, as the title suggests details the first year of action for Batman and the inspiration for many of his methods, and, also, his mentallity, but it doesn't just foccus on a single character; a noticable part of the book is centered on James Gordon, the police comissioner we all know and love, and how he came to be where he is, and how his alliance with Batman was forged.    Of both characters I found myself rooting the most for the comissioner, who Frank Miller managed to make into a compelling, interesting, multilayered and, most importantly, flaved and humane character, and his segments in the comic, atleast I personally, found to be the most interesting(to say the thruth, this comic actually made Gordon my favourite character of the Batman mythos, yes, that's right, I prefer him to Batman).    Not to say that the Batman sections in the novel were bad or uninteresting, but his story is one most Batman fans(excluding some of the more specific details upon which this comic expands) by now pretty much know by heart, so it was James Gordons part of the story, that, atleast for me, had the most impact and had the most interesting setpieces, which I refuse to spoil here. What I can say is that, you'll witness some truly memorable moments, the transformation and evolution of both protagonists before your eyes and some new information regarding both characters, that will shed them in a much different light.    The story itself is structured over the time spane of a single year and shows how Batman was inspired to create his costume, how Catwoman(who also is an important part of the story) choose to lead a life of vigilantism and first met(perhaps not strictly in perosn)Batman, and just quite how deep did the corruption run in Gotham city. Frank Millers writing is as good as always, ussualy portrait in the inner monologs of many characters, that create a new and interesting angle into the characters mentallity. The story is riddled with manyintense set-pieces, that, worry not, I will not spoil in this review, as much of their impact relies on surprise(also worth of mentione is the dark and brooding atmosphere which envelops much of the story and greatly helps the immersion).    I will say, however, that it is refreshing to see Batman actually be in mortal danger for once in a story and not just steam-roll his way through the opposition, relying on the \\"prepared for anything\\" gimmic, that he has been relying on so much in many modern comics(I know \\"being prepared\\" is part of Batmans character, but it destroys much of a tension a story can have, if you know that Batman just happened to be prepared for the exact type of trap The Riddler had for him, six years ago).    My only criticism of the story comes from the fact that, do to the stories structure which spans an entire year, it can often be the case, when entire months are given just one or two pannels of exposition , and the story often insists on jumping from character to character a bit too often, which can make the story feel a bit disjointed. For these flaws I deduct the comic a star.    Sppeaking of the art, I have heard many people calling it too simplistic, uninteresting or just plain simply bad, but I beg to differ with these oppinions - yes the art isn't overtly detailed, and the coloring may seem very simplistic and perhaps even primitive, but I think it does the story a favour, in the sense that it portrays a more simple time in Gothams history were there weren't no supervillains and hardly any superheroes or vigilantes. The colloring also helps enchance the depresing mood of the city, that suits the story well.  I also didn't particullary mind the simplicty of the art, to say the truth I even prefered it to many modern, overly detailed comic art, which may seem great individualy, but as a part of a coherent whole, they often can ruin the pacing of the story.    That wasn't the case in Batman:Year one, the art had a great pacing(despite the loose nature of the story) and was always portrayed from a great angle, and, most importantly it always had a great impact and punch to it, be it scenes of action or drama, the art seemed always able to portray the required emotion and power of them.    As far as the purchase recommandation goes, the question stands: should you buy this comic? In short - yes!  It doesn't matter if your a long time Batman fan or new to the whole mythos, or, perhaps, the whole comics genre; Batman:Year One is as good of a place to start as any. In fact Batman:Year One is one my highest recommandations as a starting point for comics(alongside Watchmen, The Joker and Kick-Ass), for people who are new to the genre:it contains great art, inteligent story, humane characters and great writing(and that is discounting all the bonus materials, such as scetches and parts of the script), and I believe almost anyone could find something worth of interest inside this great story!
159562015X|5.0|This book is not very meaty, but because of the great price at Amazon, it's a good way to buy the voucher for the test, and then the book is sort of a guide to that test.

B000PDYVVG|3.0|Firstly, I think Elizabeth Gilbert's memoir of her travel to Italy, India and Indonesia was a very courageous memoir. As far as the actual quality of the book goes, I think it was average. There were some parts of the book that I had to push myself to get through. I was especially interested in the beginning of the book before she went on travel. She discussed her marriage and how it was falling apart. This is something that I think people can relate to and captured me as a reader. Italy was also interesting. She lost my interest part of the time in India, and toward the end of her experience in India, I started to become interested again. Bali was also interesting, as she found love during that part. Overall, I woudl say this is a good novel that can keep your interest if you allow it to, but it really would not be on my \\"novel of the year\\" list.<br /><br />I can see the perspective of other reviewers who felt that she was selfish and whiny throughout the novel. I don't rate her poorly for that, because I think she has a right to be selfish and whiny during her own memoir. After all - it is about her. However, it doesn't make her likeable to a lot of people.<br /><br />I would imagine there are a lot of people that do relate to her - nothing specifically had to be \\"wrong\\" in her marriage other than she just didn't feel free or like it was the right thing for her. It is awesome that she had the opportunity to travel the world to \\"find herself\\" so to speak.<br /><br />Anyway, read the book and see for yourself.

0062009540|4.0|I admit, I've had this book on my shelf for awhile now.  Then ABC Family decided to make it a television series.  My interest was caught, but I couldn't decide if I wanted to watch the series first or read the book (or the series).  I finally decided to read this one and go from there.  I'm so glad I did.  The rest of the series immediately went on my wishlist.<br /><br />I think the setting is perfect for this time of story.  Rosewood reminds me of a very rich, and very snooty town.  It's the type of town were you keep your friends close but your enemies closer.  And this seems to apply just as much to the teenagers as it does the adults.  And these teens have plenty to hide.  The setting reminds me of the show The O.C.  Imagine what trouble these girls can cause!<br /><br />The characters are devious and will stop and nothing to get what they want.  But, at the same time they are all afraid of having their deepest secrets devluged.  I felt sorry for Spencer is away.  She's always trying to get her share of the limelight.  Her sister seems like a royal pain in the a**.  I think I liked Aria the best.  She's not comfortable with being back in town and I think she's determined not to fall back into the stereotypes that labeled her before.  Hanna was the easiest to dislike.  For some reason, her personality and actions just didn't sit with me.  Emily seems like background character.  She's the follower and still not at ease with what happened before and what's happening now.<br /><br />  The story is a guilty pleasure.  For teens, they sure have a lot to hide.  Quite a few secrets are laid out in this first book.  Each teen has something that A was keeping a secret from before she disappeared.  The new \\"A\\" also knows something that each teen has done in the present.  I was afraid some of these secrets might be over the top, but I think it's all within reasonable limits for teens.  There is some adult situations, but nothing that shocked me.  I really enjoyed the story.  I think it's an interesting setup for the rest of the series.  I will be looking forward to what the teens do in the next books and what other secrets can be uncovered!resting setup for the rest of the series.  I will be looking forward to what the teens do in the next books and what other secrets can be uncovered!
B0030DBGXY|4.0|This is a pretty fine knife. Nice shape, nice steel, nice overall feel. The sheath, on the other hand, is astoundingly disappointing. If you turn the sheathed knife upside down, without the clasps buttoned, the knife will fall out.    Now a more direct review of the knife:    The knife is better than I expected. It's nice and thick, so you know it can take a beating, it has stainless on the outside for rust protection and flexibility and carbon on the inside for hardness and edge-holding. Also, the knife came out of the box shaving sharp and needle pointed.    Overall, great knife, poor sheath. I will likely be getting a custom made sheath for this knife because I like it so much.
B000KQGOA4|5.0|I had previously owned Karajan's digital performance of this work for Berlin, and I was confused about why the performance was so unsatisfying. The music seemed to be right in Karajan's wheelhouse, much in the same way that he had a natural affinity for Richard Strauss. But the performance lacked fire, and orchestral execution especially among the brass was a letdown. When I discovered this recording, I eagerly snapped it up. I've found that Karajan during the period spanning the late 1950s - mid 1960s is when he was at his best. He conducts the VPO here in a blistering performance, with driven, masculine conceptions of Mars and Jupiter especially. He may miss the last bit of emotion in Venus, but he more than makes up for this elsewhere. The late 1950s VPO was in excellent shape, and the brass in particular sound great on this recording. This is among a small handful of great performances of this work, along with [[ASIN:B000056TKD Steinberg/Boston]], [[ASIN:B000001GCZ Levine/Chicago]], and [[ASIN:B0000041S7 Dutoit/Montreal]]. The filler, Strauss' Don Juan, is given a reading which belies Karajan's reputation as a Strauss specialist. It's marvelously done and something any fan of Karajan or Strauss will want to hear.    The sound is excellent. During this period Decca was at the forefront of recording techniques, and the sound is remarkable considering the vintage. Spacious, warm, and surprisingly immediate. The booklet is fine, though not great. The Originals series in general tends to lack a quality set of liner notes.    This is an excellent recording of this work, made by a great conductor nearing his creative peak. Vienna may not be the orchestra he is most associated with, but this is a special partnership that leads to a performance which catches fire for extended stretches. Recommended.
1416550550|5.0|I love the way this story unfolds layer by layer. Just when you think you've solved the mystery, another layered perspective cracks open and leaves you yearning for more. I love the characters of this story. They are vivid and enchanting. We can all relate to them in some way or another, even if this story holds deeper secrets than most. One of my favorite things about a good book is that it quickly engages me, and keeps me turning the pages. This is exactly what this book did for me. I put the book down for about a week while I was in a transition of moving. But I couldn't get my mind off the book the whole time I was unpacking. I wanted to know what happened. The book made me ask so many questions my mind ached to understand. Kate Morton is a fantastic and intelligent writer that I will gladly follow through her career. I'm eagerly looking forward to her next book, and even possible movies?
B0036BDQ6U|5.0|I was hesitant to buy the vinyl due to all the negative feedback that the LP was getting...Review after review said that the pressing was horrible. That it skipped, was static filled, that the grooves weren't centered, that it was unlistenable...WHAT???? WHERE? HOW? This LP is amazing!....Perfect sound, no skipping...just Pantera doing what they do best!  Maybe I lucked out? My turntable is from the 80's and it plays perfectly...This is definately worth the money!
B002BKIERI|5.0|Was very happy with the prompt delivery and the quality of the cd.  Very impressed.
B003OF3R0S|5.0|Don't listen to the negative reviews there either anything post Waken The Fallen sucks or just hate A7X for no good reason.  I've only like A7X since COE but I enjoy all there albums post COE and pre COE.  Now to tell you the truth I didn't like Nightmare when it first came out (for some strange reason) but after a few listens I let it sink in and now I am hooked.  Nightmare isn't the only great thing about the album ALL THE SONGS ARE TOP NOTCH!  There is not a single dud on the album its a huge step up from there self-titled release which I could never figure out why that album was \\"self-titled worthy\\" it is definitely not as good as Nightmare.  I also kind of fear for the next album because Mike Portnoy will not be substituting for \\"The Rev\\" after his tragic death in December.  I was a bit worried when I heard he was filling in I didn't think he would fit in with A7X but after listening to this album I can't say more than good things about him he was the perfect candidate.  I hope in time they do find the perfect drummer and still continue because in my honest opinion this is there \\"Black Album\\" and I still think A7X has what it takes to continue and if they decide to end I will support whatever they choose to do.  In my opinion I think Mike should just be the studio drummer and if he has to work with Dream Theater while A7X tour they should just hire a tour drummer if Mike can't play.  All in all this is one of the top albums of 2010 and probably there best since COE.  If they decide to call it quits after this I completely understand at least they will go out on a high note.
B003ITZBW2|4.0|Fitting three major villains and the mysterious namesake character into a 75 minute film is an admirably but perhaps overly ambitious project. Spiderman 3 couldn't pull off a three villain story with two hours.   Luckily the creators - mostly Judd Winnick, adapting his own comic - know what they're doing, and bring together multiple strands of Batman history that adds to, rather than distracts from, the central story.    As a viewer with only a dim knowledge of the Batman comics history, I went into this without any strong opinion about Jason Todd, apparently a favorite target of fanboys, whose death at the hands of the Joker opens the film. Five years later, a vigilante known as the Red Hood makes his presence known in Gotham's underworld, mainly by killing and manipulating its members. The highest-profile of these members is Black Mask, who spends a lot of money trying to get rid of the new presence and who eventually asks for the Joker's help (spoiler: this ends up being a bad move). Batman's attention is necessarily demanded, and he approaches the Red Hood pretty much the same way he would approach any villain. Even with the aid of Nightwing, though, Batman is unable to apprehend him, a failure made eerier by the fact that the Red Hood seems to know an awful lot about the Dark Knight.     Viewers expecting a typical DC Animated Universe outing might be shocked at the level of violence here. The grisly opening scene, while not showing anything more than a bit of blood, is still quite striking relative to the level of violence seen in other Batman animated releases. And this is only the start - lots of gun deaths and (offscreen) immolation and decapitation occur as well. It certainly earns its PG-13 rating, unlike, say, the uncut version of \\"Batman Beyond: Return of the Joker.\\"    This heightened violence is beneficial to the film for a number of reasons. In terms of character, it allows for a more psychopathic, less clowny version of the Joker. Fans will doubtless be comparing this version to the standard, Mark Hammill voiced DCAU incarnation, to which there is some resemblance. There are some sick laughs to be had in John DiMaggio's wry, sneering delivery, but this Joker is far more interested in death and destruction than theatrics. In terms of story and theme, it allows for the Red Hood character to be a vicious killer while undeniably undercutting the influence of Gotham's scum, bringing Batman's absolute injunction against killing into question on pragmatic and even ethical grounds.    The film's technical aspects are first-rate. Voice acting is solid all around. Bruce Greenwood's Batman is pretty similar to Kevin Conroy, a good thing for most DCAU fans. Jensen Ackles does superbly as the Red Hood, giving the character a range of emotion from callous indifference to impassioned humanity. As mentioned, DiMaggio's Joker is convincingly psychopathic. We could have used more Neil Patrick Harris as Nightwing, who provides the bulk of the comic relief. Jason Isaacs delivers his few lines as Ra's Al Ghul with a silky elegance. The fight scenes, of which there are a lot, are inventive and visceral. Save for a couple of confusing gadgets, the action is coherent.    The climax is the source of the film's only problems. A long dialogue about the conflicting morality behind the Red Hood and Batman's actions was inevitable, but it's handled clumsily. Also, the phrase \\"Good Lord\\" comes up a bit too much, and the two vigilantes reminded me of a couple of born-again Christians trying to hold back swears. This is quite a minor complaint, but it just seemed whitewashed.    Overall this is a very dark and sophisticated film, and a fine addition to the DCAU.
030745455X|5.0|I cannot for the life of me understand how there are so many people who did not like this book.  Yes, it is descriptive.  Yes, it is long.  And yes, it was impossible to put down.  I am almost always a reader of nonfiction but I picked up the first book in this series (Dragon Tattoo)based off of the massive hype and I immediately went out and bought the second when I was finished and then the third and so on.<br /><br />Lisbeth Slander is a fantastically complex creation and an utterly engrossing heroine for whom to root for.  It is absolutely worth the time to read through and see all the plot lines and mysteries come together.  How sad that the author passed away and there will be no more Lisbeth Salander.
B002VECLVO|3.0|While the cinematography of A Single Man was meant to dazzle, it gave the movie an overall look of a fashion shoot shoved into Architectural Digest.  The insistently imposing visuals took away from the emotional impact of the story.  In the novel, both George and Charlotte's houses were seedy, run-down, and cramped as are they.  In the movie, George's house was a glassy designer affair with high-end appliances and Charley's was a ridiculously overblown arboretum.  George driving a Mercedes?  He was a prof in a second-rate state college, for god's sake.  Nowhere in the novel was the character of Kenny Potter a girly-faced angel; he was a beaky-nosed redhead whose intellect made him initially attractive to George.  And there was no hustler named Carlos who walked poutily out of a Calvin Klein ad.     The impending suicide by firearm was an obvious and unnecessary structural contrivance.  George's prissy attempts at auditioning various locations in his perfectly appointed house for his finale so not to be messy was a hoot rather than pathetic.  Adding this element went against the spirit of Isherwood's novel, which is a day in the disappointed life of an aging man in profound grief who goes about his quotidian activities with occasional hopeful flashes of recovery--and dies.  Isherwood understood the absurdity of the human condition.  Tom Ford drowned the understated emotional power of the novel with his showing off.  I can't believe that Isherwood's longtime partner, Don Bachardy, who was credited as a creative consultant in this movie, agreed to this revision of the novel.    I waited patiently to see this movie until I finished reading the novel because I didn't want Isherwood's words superimposed by someone else's images, but I see now that it wouldn't have mattered because Tom Ford's movie isn't Christopher Isherwood's novel.  Colin Firth is, of course, amazing as George Falconer; but for a truly moving experience of A Single Man, I suggest a reading of Isherwood's novel instead of this cinematic gay chic.
0061478784|4.0|I had originally seen the movie by Hayao Miyazaki and hadn't even realized that there was a book.  I stumbled across it quite by accident and of course had to read it.  I have to say, I was pretty pleased with it.  Even with my preconceived notions from the movie, I still enjoyed the plot and all the characters in the book.<br /><br />Sophie is the oldest of three girls, and in her world, that means she's due to live an uneventful unlucky life.  When a tough break with a witch leaves her looking like an old woman, she leaves the hat shop where she works and wanders, eventually coming upon Howl's Moving Castle.  While she's heard horrible things about Howl and young women, she figures since she is old now she should be safe.<br /><br />While staying with Howl she learns some of his secrets and makes friends with Calcifer, a fire demon who is bound to Howl and runs the castle.  Along with Michael, his apprentice, Howl has turned this castle into quite the wondrous place. Sophie agrees to help Calcifer in return for his help and becomes Howl's cleaning lady. But will Sophie be able to get back to normal and help Howl with his own problems?  There is an evil witch after him and the King wants his help in finding his brother; he may not have the time to return Sophie to normal.<br /><br />The characters in this novel are pretty delightful.  I especially love Calcifer.  Even though he may just be fire, he's got quite the personality.  Sophie and Howl have interesting interactions and its easy to see that despite their annoyances, they like bantering with each other.  Even the side characters show some interesting traits; after all, this is a world that accepts magic.<br /><br />The writing, since this is technically a kid's book is on the side of easier to understand. There's not a lot of hard language or concepts in the book.  I will say that towards the end of the book the writing gets rushed and hard to follow.  I had really enjoyed the book up until that part but I found myself reading in patches near the end just so I could try to make sense of what was going on.  I think if Jones had just slowed down and detailed a bit more it would have vastly improved it.  Despite the confusion at the end, I'm sure this would make a great book to read to a child.<br /><br />Such a wondrous imaginative book though.  I did enjoy it for the most part.

B000K7VHQ4|5.0|Complex story. Pay attention. It is well worth it. One of my favorites, the sort that you can go back and watch again.
0061537969|1.0|I would not have finished this book if I weren't on vacation with little else to read.    This book is barely better than a Harlequin romance: the story is simplistic, the narrative is uncreative, the plot is predictable, the characters are black and white.  It was written for a 6th grade reading level.    The only interesting thing about this book is that it is narrated by a dog (a dog that knows too much about car racing and history channel documentaries, but still only can communicate two ideas \\"faster\\" (= 2 barks), and \\"don't sign these papers\\" (= peeing on them)).  The only tidbit of philosophical interest:  you make your own future: it's not the track, but how you drive it. (If this is original to you, maybe you SHOULD read this book).    This book would make a dull, Sunday evening, made-for-TV movie.  (Or a book that gets 900 5-star reviews from the illiterate masses).    Seriously, if you like to read, pick ANYTHING else.  If you have a book club made up of anyone over the age of 14, pick ANYTHING else.      This was harsh, but this was seriously one the worst books I have ever read.  And I like dogs, and I don't mind car racing.
B003JTHESA|5.0|\\"The Final Frontier\\" is the best Iron Maiden album since 1988's \\"Seventh Son of a Seventh Son\\".  (It is slightly better than 2000's \\"Brave New World\\").  I can't imagine how anyone who considers themselves an Iron Maiden fan would not love this album.  What makes these songs especially good are the subtleties, stuff that the casual listener might not recognize or appreciate.  \\"The Final Frontier\\" is as rewarding as it is complex.  If it doesn't impress you the first time you hear it, listen again, and pay attention.
B003JTHESA|2.0|2006's A Matter of Life and Death was a complex, heavy record, which took certainly more than one sitting to fully digest and appreciate.  The album boasted several standout tracks - notably, The Reincarnation of Benjamin Breeg and Lord of Light, both of which were on the second batch of songs - but the middle portion of the record seemed to run together, a collection of songs that Steve Harris & Co. seemed to over-compose, extending tracks to 8 minutes where a 4 ½ minute song would have been just as well.  But because so many of these songs had memorable hooks, great melodies, mind-boggling guitar solos and, most of all, heart, they were easy to look past.    This habit was a minor annoyance on AMOLAD, but became a full-blown vice on The Final Frontier, Maiden's first album of new material in four years.  There's no good way to say it: This album stinks.       The band sounds thin, they sound tired, and worst of all, they sound like they're out of ideas.  It is mind-boggling that the songwriting partnerships that have given us latter-day anthems like The Wicker Man, Brave New World, Paschendale and The Legacy have suddenly forgotten how to write good material.  The Final Frontier sounds nothing more than a bunch of the worst ideas from the last three albums - turds that Harris & Co. picked up off the trash heap and tried to polish.  With the exception of Mother of Mercy, Coming Home and perhaps the lead single, El Dorado, none of these songs stand up to even the weakest links on the previous three records (Age of Innocence, Gates of Tomorrow, Different World), but rather hearken back to the truly nauseating Blaze Bayley era of 1994-1998.  The Final Frontier doesn't sound a collection of new, progressive material at all - and what makes this so disheartening is that the band really thinks they've struck gold and made one of the best records of their careers.    There is very little to like on this record.  After Coming Home closes out, listeners are pummeled into boredom by track after track after track of the same old tired thing - a soft, melancholy intro, a staccato guitar riff by one Murray, Smith or Gers, a verse and chorus combination that sounds disjointed, lazy and bereft of melody, the complete lack of anything resembling a groove (does anyone remember how great Rainmaker was?), and the band painstakingly extending nearly every song three minutes longer than it needs to be.  Most disappointing is the album-closing \\"epic\\" When the Wild Wind Blows, which despite its 11-minute running time, never really gets going and seems to have been extended to 11 minutes just because Steve Harris felt like it.  I recently read an interview with Kevin Shirley where he said that, initially, the song was actually just a bunch of separate pieces of music that Harris had written, and the final product was those parts simply stitched together.  It sounds like it.  The lyrics are childish and the melody is weak.  Instead of being pensive and deep, this song sounds like a bad cliche.   After we've been treated to so many fantastic album-closers over the years -- Rime of the Ancient Mariner, Alexander the Great, Journeyman, The Legacy -- THIS is what we're left with?  The emperor has no clothes.    I love the old stuff, sure, but I also love the new stuff.  Brave New World and Dance of Death stand next to Powerslave and Seventh Son of a Seventh Son as the band's best work.  But the difference I see between mid-80s Maiden and the Maiden of 2010 is that, back in the day, the band had a sense of pace, of momentum.  On Powerslave, the band included several epics (among them the 13-minute opus Rime of the Ancient Mariner), sure, but it began the album with the four-minute Aces High, which is blistering from beginning to end.  In fact, examining the band's entire catalog, Maiden's most memorable songs don't fit a particular category.  While epics like Rime of the Ancient Mariner, Hallowed Be Thy Name and Phantom of the Opera are no doubt highlights, so too are the much shorter Wrathchild, Aces High and The Trooper.  Even where Maiden tried to be epic back in the day, they included short songs where short songs were needed - for instance, Only the Good Die Young, the album closer from Seventh Son, which clocks in at under four minutes.  And just as notably, the shorter songs didn't have to begin and end with some sort of pseudo-melancholy arpeggiated intro. Heck, even Futureal manages to stay fast throughout.    It's almost as if Harris & Co. are trying to prove a point that they're not out to write a hit single, and daring the Billboard charts to place them number one despite an album that is as far away from the mainstream as possible.  But this approach is incredibly disappointing.  As far as I can tell, after 15 albums, Iron Maiden has finally run its course.  Whether the problem is producer Kevin Shirley, the band's complacency (I have to say, doesn't it bother anyone that they play virtually the same setlist every single night on tour?) or simply the fact that Maiden is out of ideas, The Final Frontier is one of the single biggest disappointments in recent rock history.  The fact that I've read so many gushing reviews sickens me.  Maybe I bought a counterfeit copy of the album, and the real new record is floating out there somewhere, but I seriously doubt it.  This just isn't good music, as \\"epic\\" as Maiden tries so hard to sound.
B0007PLLQ0|5.0|Love this movie. This is were I fell in love with Tom Cruise. It's a Love, Drama, Action, Adventure, Horror and Fantasy movie all in one. Get it you will love it.    MonieLove
B003JTHESA|4.0|Iron Maiden's The Final Frontier is out today. Honestly first listen I was underwhelmed. By about the third listen I began to love this album overall. There is much speculation that this could be their last album. Obviously the title could be a sign. These guys are pushing 50s and 60s I believe. Which leads me to a couple of observations on the new album.    The pace of their albums continues to slow down. Dance of Death was a true return to form from the 80s imo. I was a little disappointed with A Matter of Life and Death (which I grew to love) as the album did not carry on the blistering paced momentum that Maiden gained with Dance. In every respect I'd say Final Frontier continues the trend of slowing down. This is a more mellow, introspective, even spiritual Iron Maiden. The pace of the album is almost consistent through the entire album. For the most part slow melodic introductions building to mid-tempo, melodic choruses.    Is this bad? In my opinion not at all. Maiden is just different. Sold out? Not even close. Lyrically Final Frontier is fantastic. Again revisiting the theme of war as MoLaD did. There is a definite environmental theme running through this album, specifically on Isle of Avalon (one of my favorite tracks). Most of all, this album is somewhat 'We're all doomed' heavy. There is a sadness and almost surrender to what is coming, what we have brought upon ourselves in the songwriting. 'A Wild Wind in the Willows' closes the album and is to say the least not an uplifting song.    Is this album an end of a 30+ year career? I hope not. After a few listens the moments of brilliance start to come through. Lyrically and theme-wise this album is timely with all that's going on in the world. As a guitar player, there are some 'Wow' moments. Some 'jazz fusion what the hell is that doing on a Maiden album' moments that are really cool. I really like the metal 'Portal' deluxe packaging.    I have a feeling many won't like this album. It is different, but atit's core this is still a Maiden album through and through. Experimental Maiden is better than no Maiden at all.    Up THE IRONS!    Standouts for me:    Mother of Mercy  Isle of Avalon  The Talisman  The Man Who Would Be King  Where the Wild Wind Blows
B003JTHETY|5.0|I don't intend to write a lengthy, drawn-out review that overcomplicates what I want to say. Bottom-line is that the album is amazing. Radio-friendly? No, but who cares! If you want a great album by one of the best metal bands of all time, buy it.
1601251505|5.0|The Pathfinder books are really amasing. In addition to containing all three core D&D rulebooks in just one relative tome, these books are psychic. I cannot express how helpful this has been in my DMing.
0452286751|5.0|Wow.  This book was such a treat to read on so many levels!  Don't be intimidated by the length - this book is incredibly readable, and you can read just a few pages at a time and enjoy what you are reading.  However I guarantee by the end you will be up all night to see how it unfolds.  I really was not sure up until the very end.  This book is more than just a story of characters, it is a story of society, of power, and an assessment of what makes man tick.  You can read it at any level you want.  The book has helped me put my finger on many things I have thought about myself and others - it has expressed why I might like or dislike a person, and it explains why different personalities act as they do.  Although the author is strong in her convictions, she allows alot of room for interpretation.  How I interpret scenes may not be how others interpret the same scenes- thus it is a wonderful book for discussion.  This is one of the few books where the character development is sufficient that i actually bothered to \\"question motives\\" of fictional characters - something I usually am uninspired to do.  A word of caution, many of the characters are portrayed in absolutist terms, something which normally does not appeal to me.  However in this book, it really helped to clarify my thinking on the matters which the author is presenting.  In a nutshell, it was more than just brilliant, it was truly memorable.
0307454541|3.0|Seems to me like this book could have the first 300 pages ripped out and you really would'nt lose much.  The only reason I continued to read after the first 100 pages was my co-worker's enthusiasm about the book.  I thought it was dull throughout, and had breif moments of sadistic violence that came from nowhere.  It was over-detialed about mundane instances and the real story only came out in the last 200 pages or so.  Waste of time.
B001QGTEU4|5.0|Ultimate Sin came out during the era where Ozzy was sniffing lines of ants outside the tour busses and whatnot. If you see his face on the cover of the album, you can sort of tell. However, it's this type of over indulgent lunatic drive that makes Ultimate Sin what it is... Balls to the wall, no brainer, hard rocknroll. This is Ozzys dankest eighties sound, provided by Jake E. Lee. Since this masterpiece is out of print, I whole heartedly encourage buying it on vinyl and blowing out your windows with it. Make sure the neighbors are home!<br /><br />SIDE ONE: Title track ULTIMATE SIN kicks it open, followed up twice as raw with SECRET LOSER, and NEVER KNOW WHY. The third track starts with a mess of distortion before delivering up this super hero theme song for a metal eighties cartoon show that never was. Decalring \\"We-Rock, We-Rock ROCK, ROCK ROCK!\\" ...and you'll never know why...but you don't need to know.  THANK GOD FOR THE BOMB slips a little bit, but how can you not dig the NUKE YA NUKE YA bits and the all out guitar slashing? NEVER closes out the side and leaves it waxed without a single ballad. Dank and slimy hard rock at its finest.<br /><br />Side Two opens with LIGHTNING STRIKES a heavy riffer that plays off just as hard promising that if side two is gonna have any sort of ballad at all, it's gonna have to be a deep one. Rockin all night, punks. Over here, KILLER OF GIANTS is that ballad. FOOL LIKE YOU is gonna chime in off the end with some epic stuff that'll kick it back into rock and roll; dank, riffing, rock out. Then it closes out with some SHOT IN THE DARK, which you gotta crank a bit louder if theres any room left on the dial. Seriously, it's one of Ozzys most epic tracks, and for some reason gets brushed under the rug! LOUD!!! Now Flip that thing over and play it LOUD again! INSANE FIVE for this find.
B003CFBQBW|5.0|What I love about the soundtrack is that it correlates with the movie, the story.  Listening to it I am reminded of various scenes and situations.  This kind of music - indie - was not even remotely what I was accustomed to listening to before the Twilight saga.  I am a country music fan.  But the Twilight books, movies, and<br />soundtracks create an atmosphere, a feeling if you will.  And that I like to take with me.
B0036EH3WK|5.0|This entire series from beginning to end is the best things tv has had to offer yet...riveting storytelling at it's finest!
0399156577|1.0|I don't typically get bored with Nora Roberts' books, but I thought this one would never end.  The main characters were kind of cute together, but I found them to be uninteresting as individuals.  Maybe it's because I'm not a dog person?  Maybe it was because it really wasn't that suspenseful?  I don't know.  I just know that I was excited to see this new book from her, and was really disappointed when I finally read it.
B0025KVLUG|2.0|A typical soundtrackalbum hence that the music is depended on the film. Only four new beatlestracks, with Lennons \\"Hey Bulldog\\" as the classic, which would have formed a strong EP. This album feels like an unnecessery rip-off.
B0013D8LCW|5.0|This is one of my favorite films. I don't buy a lot of DVDs because I live in a small apartment and I prefer digital media, but I wanted to have a hard copy of this film to keep.
6304698526|5.0|The detective is awakened by the door buzzer, gets out of bed in his paisley, olive green pajamas, and walks down the stairs to pull the door release lever.  He turns around to return to the bedroom: he then sits on the side of the bed and yawns.  \\"He walked with stiff ankles, and yawned so innocently\\" I muse. \\"What has this man been up to, I question myself. Evidence #1 that McQueen is intent on authenticity. This detective accepts an assignment to protect a witness for trial.  When mayhem occurs with the witness taking a blood bath in the hotel 5 minutes away, it seems fair to conclude Bullitt thought he was hired as a babysitter.<br />Again, Bullitt doesn't talk very much but his eyes, his mouth, his face convey emotions of a confident man, an intelligent man, with a mind of intrigue. When heat is put on him from the \\"higher up\\" to handle the incident quid pro quo Bullitt, with few words, initiates a fascinating ploy to disrupt their plan. He carries out his plan, not for self glory, or to banish the bad guys, but to expose the corruption because he knows he is good at what he does.<br />McQueen opted for real doctors and real nurses to portray hospital scenes (evidence #2). He opted to drive that Mustang (license plate JJZ109)at speeds up to 100 mph for the car chases (evidence #3). Whether we see him as Bullitt, or McQueen on the \\"set scenes\\" he is one cool guy, self possessed, confident, and not arrogant.  So fascinating. PS. Robert Vaughn is such a high class, cultured protaganist.  Also Robert Duvall makes an interesting taxi driver for this bit part in the film. I purposely remained vague with plot details for your viewing pleasure.
B002T9H2LA|2.0|Many years ago I watched a movie directed by Quentin Tarantino, I promised myself then I would never voluntarily watch another movie he directed, last night I broke that promise to myself. The cast did a great job especially the one known as the \\"Jew Hunter\\". The costumes where excellent. But at the end of the movie I asked what was the point of this stupid movie? I thought it was going to be a new untold story of WWII, but it was just a venue for Tarantino to display the violence that has been the main theme in both of his movies I have seen. It was a waste of my time. And I promise myself I will never voluntarily watch another one of his movies. This time I really mean it.
