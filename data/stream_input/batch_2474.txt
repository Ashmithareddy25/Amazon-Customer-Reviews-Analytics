B002UNMW7O|5.0|I am a huge fan of Boondock Saints. Flannery and Reedus could not do a better job portraying these chracters. All Saints Day doesn't disappoint. The brotherly dynamic is as strong as ever, although there is a bit more comedy between them this time. Some of the action scenes are a bit impossible, but it makes for a good movie and certainly makes you root for the brothers again.
B0009X75UG|5.0|GREAT theme! The flow of the music is so beautiful and its a masterpiece that cant be topped by any of his other cds.
B007SGM084|5.0|I have never read anything like i read. I have read this book twice so far. thxs for the book
B009MYARIK|3.0|I love Sophie Kinslella novels. This one didn't finish well; there was a lot left to be desired. I really like the sister relationship. However I would love to hear more from the order sister and really hear how her story ended. Part II maybe??
B003XF1XOQ|4.0|The ending was not what I expected. The book was engaging from the beginning to the end. I would recommend this series to anyone.
B00COGXGNQ|5.0|Definitely kept me on my toes.  I read the book and well, it's slightly different but the movie take was really good.  They kept the movie pretty clean and I like that.  The acting was great and just when you settle in, something happens to keep you on the edge of your seat again.  Loved it!
1451668945|5.0|I am a huge fan of Mary Higgins Clark! I love the suspenseful twists and turns as the story unfolds.
B00CDT41RY|1.0|Instead of providing a worthwhile social commentary, the viewer is treated to a bloated, dragging romp through macho coolness and unaware absurdism. The lone bright spot: the acting, which was mostly well done considering the transparent script the talented actors had to work with. If you like staring  a screen for 3 hours saying things like: &#34;Whoa he's so badass!&#34; as blood spatters and bad one-liners are delivered by actors who deserve more, this movie is for you.
B004SRPXWQ|2.0|its cute and worth it only becasue its free and it can be improved some if ya want it to be if u curse it will curse back ad if ya want to talk dirty to it it talks dirty back and it  makes me giggle like a lil school girl but we enjoy ourselves and have fun thanks pop for buying me this kindle huge thanks and much love poppa
B0063IH60K|4.0|Solitaire is a enjoyable game's I would recommend it for anyone who likes card games. The game is better than I anticipated. I like the options.
B007MC8YLQ|5.0|Great game to take a mind break.  Use it to take me away and be free.  Not always easy but always a pleasure.
B0090O07RS|5.0|The film looked great, really high quality. The sound is good too.Definitely the best complete Doors concert video. I thought the black and white footage from their sound stage appearance on European tv had better sound but that was only 4 or 5 songs and not an entire concert.
B003P2WO5E|4.0|Alright, so Sanderson has finally begun a huge epic fantasy series.  Who knows where he will lead us? At 1000 pages it's a bit daunting, but being an avid reader of Brian I feel he wants his readers to experience something magical with each book, and because of the extra length he tries harder.  Still, it's the 1st book of the series and doesn't quite have the usual speed, yet by the end you do see he ties everything together.<br />It truly is about the journey and the not just getting to the end.  And we know he can deliver a great ending after finishing the Wheel series.
B009FZFONO|4.0|I am a HUGE fan of season 1 & 2 of The Walking Dead.  This season continues the storyline with some of your favorite characters, along with some new ones.
B007V65R54|4.0|Nate Silver caught my attention after his amazing predictions around the last Presidential election. In this book, he looks at the application of statistics and predictive analytics in a plethora of subject areas: politics, poker, finance, chess, climate change, even terrorism. He describes the strengths and weaknesses of modeling in a generally accessible way, stressing always the importance of context and assumption.
B003UM6MPC|5.0|It's a good quality soundtrack; it's mixed well and the levels are good. The whole cast does a great job.
B005CRQ2DK|5.0|This is the best book I have ever read! I am 100% sure kids are going love reading this very funny book!
B00CHIMG6Y|5.0|This movie was predictable, of course, we all know the story of the tsunami but the acting and directing in this movie made you feel like you were there. I found myself holding my breath, crying as Lucas found and lost his mother and his compassion for his fellow man was way beyond his years. He was the movie!!! Great job by all
B0063M22QO|5.0|Good game for beginners like me. This game is fun and easy to follow.The tiles are big enough to see and clearly marked.I think.it was well.worth the 99 cents I paid for it. The sounds are nice.too, very subtle.
B00BQH9SY0|5.0|great lyrics and they sound fantastic. every single song is awesome, go get \\"i'm sorry\\" and \\"thank you\\" too...amazing new band
B003EY7IRC|5.0|Great writing kept me from putting it down.  Love the series and plan to collect the remaining series in kindle format.  Already have it in hardcopy.
B004T4KQJS|5.0|Really interesting read.  Heard this guy on NPR, glad I purchased the book and leads me to want to do more research on the topics.
B00CDT41RY|5.0|great movie, great action, music is amazing. Very awesome, watched it twice.  If you like Tarantino movies, you will love this one.
B00C7TAF3Y|5.0|I would love to play more puzzle games like this!<br /><br />Great graphics. Great sound, fun gameplay. Worth $2, variety of puzzles Times. Hints were helpful not annoying.
1616550414|5.0|if ur a zelda fan u love this! great price! covers all zelda games including skyward sword. Miyamoto interview was great!
B009IEXKXI|2.0|A good idea...but again the execution becomes the issue.<br />This data driven story needed to be expanded beyond it's mechanical confines.<br />Somewhat ham-fisted and myopic.
B0054SMIH6|4.0|It's one of my first audio books.  It made the miles fly.  I managed to loose my place in the book a couple times -- not the book's fault -- but I did go searching through the whole thing to find my place and finish.  McConaughey was just right.
193700788X|1.0|This is just a sad piece of garbage. Eric was written as being a forgettable loose end. Why bother then with all the previous books about them? It just makes me hate this whole series.
B0077ATSSQ|4.0|This movie is beautifully done, period. I absolutely adored the book, and this movie is vastly different. In some ways, this is disappointing, but film is a different medium than print, and comparing the two is not entirely fair. Although this movie does not capture the art and complexity embodied by the novel, it's still a good film in its own right.
B0011KQSZ4|5.0|This movie is hilarious.  Slow to get going but hang in there.  Need to watch it more than once. So much subtle and not so subtle humor.  Have seen both the American and British versions.  The British version is superior.  Leave it to the Brits.
B0060MYM7O|5.0|This show rocks, do your self a service. Go watch all of season one, two and three. Then go read the books.
B004SD5GZ4|5.0|Works just the way I expected it to. Always happy with this whether on Kindle or PC. re is more control with this than the default reader on the Kindle Fire HD.
B00002SSKI|5.0|Such a fun story for many fans. Very good movie. All the interactions and goings on make it cute and playful.
B007Z9QTVI|5.0|What a great way to spend a couple of hours--this movie was a great story to get lost in. Loved it!
B00003CXIP|5.0|Lots to enjoy and laugh at. You'll like the interactions and fun things that happen. The guys are great to watch.
0375869026|5.0|This is a great book for teens and pre-teens. I would actually give it to younger kids in a heartbeat. This is a beautifully written anti-bullying book about a boy with some physical peculiarities from the boy's point of view. I would read this again and again.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|This is a really fun game. And it is so worth playing in my opinion. I like how the farther you get in the game the fast you start to run and have to avoid running into things and avoid the cop chasing you
0525478817|5.0|John Green has written a beautifully tragic novel for teens with &#34;The Fault in Our Stars&#34;. I won't give away too much, but it has to be the saddest, happiest, thought provoking teen novel that I could've read recently. I suggest it for young and older alike.
B00AWQEKIK|4.0|He's quiet, melancholic, psychedelic, country, Latin, guitar-hero and harmonic. He's Stephen Stills. This gives us a great insight and journey thru his many talents.<br /><br />Nice packaging. The only track I had hoped for that isn't in the collection isthe STUDIO version of Dark Star, but I did get a live version which is great, just not as atmospheric as the studio cut.<br /><br />So I will have to get the CSN album just to get that cut.<br /><br />Nice one!
B005LAIIKI|4.0|Sadly, I couldn't play the blue-ray disk in my 'new' system; the first disk I have bought online that this has happened with; screen message said my system was incompatible. I recognise that is the risk one takes when making purchases of this type.<br />The DVD worked fine, and I enjoyed the movie. Some of the comedic moments were a bit foolish, though.
B00AA0TJO8|5.0|great app, very creative and fun for all ages.  I would recommend to anyone who likes games with different courses and challenges.
B007IXWL2C|5.0|I loved this trilogy!  I didn't want to stop reading. I am hoping that she will write more to go along with this story line.
B000Q6GUW0|3.0|A very well done series that captivates the viewer despite tending to strain credulity, and having a disturbing theme with questionable moralities.
B00CL68QVQ|5.0|from start to finish the storyline was involving from funny to sad ,brought to life real life issue actors did a good job
B00871C09S|5.0|This was one of Hitchcock's best. Not only was it well performed and directed, but introduced some interesting themes to supplement the basic suspense.
B00CL0J99K|4.0|I love the Iron Man franchise and Iron Man 3 was best out of all of them. But Iron Man 3 was not better than last year's blockbuster, The Avengers. Tony Stark is awesome, but he is much more awesome with the rest of the avengers by his side.
B009MYARIK|5.0|This one of her best books - you will find yourself laughing out loud!  A delightful read, the two sisters are too funny!
B00966TN1Q|3.0|ending was obvious before half book was read. I guess Harry is just getting old like me, not so exciting anymore. time to really retire.
B00BSBUZPK|5.0|I've been an Eagles fan forever.. Great history biographical interview back story.  Concert is from Hotel CA Tour of 1977.
B001ANSSDC|4.0|I really like this book, it was interesting and opened my eyes to the problems that so many people go through.  Quick exposes the mind set of how people with depression and bipolar think and act the way they do to events that hurt them so much. I really like this book and I would read it before the movie because, from seeing trailers and clips to the movie, it is definitly different.
B007IXWKUK|4.0|I really enjoyed this book and couldn't put it down, but it certainly wasn't the same as the first one.
B0094K1QR8|5.0|I realized that when I watched this just how I was actually being used!!! and that is sad so sad
B00BSBT8M6|5.0|The visual effects in this movie are so good it's a must watch!  Storyline is good too. Will keep you engaged the whole time!
B002JXICCY|1.0|did not realize it was so old of a movie it was so boring sorry I purchased it yuck suck
B002BWQ6H6|4.0|How does one's life get intertwined with others, and what shapes our lives?  These themes are apparent in this very touching tale of people whose lives touch one another,
B007REV4YI|5.0|I wounder what the bond fransie will come up with next as they hinted at the end of this movie will have another bond film in 2016?
B00A3VLJCE|1.0|I bought the Kindle Fire specifically for photos as I am an amatuer photographer (work in a studio but learning to do it on my own) and this is the only app I have found to help me with the editing. It doesnt even work with the kindle fire :( So upset. It took my money.. though. Any suggestions for good editing apps for the kindle fire? Also photo organizing? The gallery is fine but does not organize them the way I need them to. Thanks guys!!<br />Shannon
B0055S348W|5.0|Love that I can print from anywhere; from any of my devices.  it takes a little bit to set up initially but ( took about 45 mins.) but its so worth it.  I Love It!
0061711292|4.0|I think this is a very good short novel.  1930s Edinburgh is brought into focus, as the \\"Brodie set\\" become gradually more influenced by their teacher, Miss Jean Brodie.  The \\"Brodie\\" set are chosen by Brodie, and she seeks to guide them.  Brodie is an admirer of fascism, seeing in it an effective solution to problems, such as mass unemployment.  At first Miss Jean Brodie is in some ways quite an ambivalent figure (despite the admiration for fascism).  However, as the novel goes on her commitment to fascism takes on a more sinister turn, as one of her pupils leaves school and volunteers for the Republican side in the Spanish Civil War (she is killed in Spain).  Brodie had encouraged her to take this course of action.  She become more extreme in other ways as well.  Brodie is eventually sacked from her position as teacher.  Miss Jean Brodie finds out that it was one of her set that contributed to her sacking.  The novel manages to capture the atmosphere of 1930s Edinburgh very well, there is a definite sense of place and time.  More broadly, it looks at the very unfortunate and ominous appeal that fascism had in the 1930s, even in Western European democratic countries.  The novel captured in a small way the danger and damage that fascism caused across Europe in the 1930s and 1940s.
B001KZG99A|5.0|Have seen all three of the Iron Man movies. Planning on buying the set of three that are available now.
B003TSEEDY|5.0|I love it's beauty and the simplicity about the way Charlie spoke that made it easy to relate to and honest
B005IQ39AY|5.0|I will recommend it to all my  friends who  May be feeling bored it is so easy to play and you can play it anywhere
B006GHA9QQ|5.0|I am a huge Phantom of the Opera fan.  I first saw the sequel in the movie theater and loved it!  I was excited to purchase it and share it with my daughter and others who enjoy great musicals.  I was particularly impressed with the very talented cast, even though no one is better at playing the Phantom than Michael Crawford!  The DVD of the live play is far and away better than the movie version of Phantom of the Opera.  This version of Love Never Dies was an excellent follow up to the Royal Albert Hall production on DVD produced for the 25th Anniversary of that play.
0374214913|5.0|It is a fast read and good story. Would highly recommend if you want to gain some insight into Google and the book binding craft.
B004K4AVAG|5.0|This is a great product and I would purchase from this seller again in the furture. I'm pleased with the delivery and shipment of the product. I've also recommended this seller to my Family and Friends. Thank You!<br /><br />Twenty Words:<br />It's the season of Mom and Dad! Celebrate the good things that being a parent brings. make this year special with heartfelt gestures, and great gifts that give back.
030758836X|2.0|Meh-this is a page turner once you get past a certain point. Characters were not compelling enough to care for.
B009JVSAVM|5.0|Finally a chance to see the episodes in order and see the character development over time. Now to get the next episodes.
B00A0R0CG0|4.0|My son loves this movie and is looking forward to watching it many more times! Wasn't available on Netflix so amazon saved the day
B009UX2YAC|5.0|This is nothing like temple run it is alot better this is the best game it is soo adicting this is very fun you should try ot sometime if you like temple run u will like this but this is aloooot better
B0063M22QO|5.0|Definitely worth the money,I am a big fan of Mahjong<br />Love this game would definitely refer my friends to purchase
B005MJDJQQ|5.0|I enjoyed this mystery.  An unlikely mass murderer, a baffled police force, the murderer spending time in the apartment of Kurt Wallander while he is asleep and Kurt never realizing it.  Fast paced, excellent descriptions without getting too wordy, the usual frustrated love-life of so many fictional detectives.  (I wonder if this is actually true for real life detectives.)  The translator did an excellent job.  I will be reading  more Kurt Wallander mysteries.
B0054JZC6E|5.0|I'm pretty much creating the review to get more coins but I really like this game I play everyday and play it a lot.:)
B006LSZECO|4.0|A new unexpected twist every few chapters!  Great character development, not sure which character has more issues.  Definitely cliff hanger until the finale.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|This game is truly awesome. I play it everyday. I believe that it is easier than temple run and has way better graphic designs. I encourage everyone to play this amazing game.
B009NY43NY|1.0|Saddened and disgusted with how the final book was written from beginning to end. Anti-climatic, hard to follow, and boring. I hate having this as my final memory of Sookie. I honestly wish I had not read it.
0316017930|4.0|Certainly an enlightening book. Gladwell's writing certainly suits his purpose, and after you finish the book you'll have a new perspective on &#34;great&#34; people.
B005K0HDGE|5.0|I didn't realize Stephen King  wrote anything but horror and was very pleasantly surprised by this book. It kept me turning the pages and I would recommend it to all my friends.
B004TI5N38|4.0|Excellent read moves quickly, has lots of twists that keep you guessing. I would recommend it for anyone who likes a good thriller.
B0049P1VHS|5.0|This series was very well done, the make-up and the special effects were terrific in both (S1 & S2) and am looking forward to (S3) when it eventually and hopefully comes out of DVD.
B00CL68QVQ|3.0|after all the hoopla surrounding this movie.  Jennifer Lawrence was good but not Oscar worthy imho. Bradley Cooper was ok. I didn't like the &#34;happy&#34; ending all wrapped up in a neat little package.  Real life is messier than that.
B005LAJ22Q|5.0|This series was very well done, the make-up and the special effects were terrific in both (S1 & S2) and am looking forward to (S3) when it eventually and hopefully comes out of DVD.
B008602KQI|4.0|Good movie. Followed the book mostly. I can't wait to see what &#34;Hollywood&#34; does with the next movies and if the follow the books as well
B00B5HQKNI|5.0|Cheaper to rent in a RedBox and the movie paused to catch up to itself a couple of times.  Good movie not sure how I feel about Amazon Prime yet.  Movies seem to expensive, when there's a Redbox on every corner for $1.39.
B00CHSPB8Y|4.0|very cool game<br />my boys love to play it<br />I enjoy it myself great way to release the stress of the day#
0425263916|5.0|Ok folks I just finished this book.  It was just awesome.  Never knew what I was going to read after I read Fifty Shades and I was so so pleased when I found this book.  I was AWESOME.  First it was Bared To You and then Reflected in You AWESOME books.  This book is even HOTTER then Fifty Shades of Grey. By the way I am on the wait list for the final book Entwined In You.  Money very very well spent.
B0011KQSZ4|5.0|But each time I watch it, and I have watched it 4 or 5 times already, it cracks me up. What a hoot!
0553386697|5.0|I really recommended to every parent who wants to understand his/hers child! It's written so ok, every medical term is explained to anyone's understanding!<br /><br />Great book, really helpful!
0345803507|5.0|Fifty Shades of loving this, this series is enticing and addicting. Very racy, and risque subject matter, but a real page turner!
B008EKOIN8|5.0|This book is an eye opener, informative and inspiring! This book has challenged me to take my love for cooking even further and eliminate breads, crackers and some cheeses from my grocery list and master making them at home. To really appreciate the process and the results of a good home cooked meal.
B00COGY6YO|5.0|Great video....NOTHING LIKE THE GAME. But great video. we have already watched it 10 times. It is a good video if you are also into Legos.  goes hand and hand.
B006M4F67A|5.0|VERY good for a free version of this game. It has enough features that I'm not sure it would be worth paying for a better version.
B003XF1XOQ|5.0|This trilogy was the first book series I've started and actually finished in a very long time. I absolutely loved all three books and this, the final book, was amazing!
0061992860|5.0|This is a very cool survival guide, and it's small size can fit virtually anywhere. Very lightweight, but a bunch of useful information.
B004EPZ00C|5.0|The packaging was good, the movie came in great shape, works etc. I love this movie! it is so funny, it made me cry. Great movie, gotta watch it!
B00AYHKIZ6|5.0|I love Bowie. So, I was really excited when I found out he had a new album coming out. I'm happy with it, he's still got that certain Bowie magic. Despite aging his voice is still strong and wonderful to hear. It's not my favorite Bowie album, but it's not my least favorite. I would recommend buying it, especially for any Bowie fan.
B0027BOL4G|4.0|The movie itself arrived in great condition. Super fast shipping as well I actually enjoyed the film but now I dislike the foods mentioned. Not for the soft hearted!
B0094BB4TW|1.0|I have been using this app for a while now only because I have no other alternative because the web browser one is too painful to use. this app though is completely horrible and annoying. literally this app is horrid. it crashes 8 to 12 times an hour. the notifications and friend request lag but the messages seem to be the only thong that actually works. the apps navigation is Linda weird the entire app often lags as well and you end up clicking on something you didn't want to click and its frustrating to get back to where you once were. I just wish they put more effort in creating an app for the most used social website. please provide and update to fix all the bugs. get the app its better than the browser but just be prepared to be annoyed by the apps failure to work properly.
B0036UO56G|5.0|Antother beautifol  movie with Barbra streisand she is a ex- lent actor and a beautiful<br />singers. the movie is very intertaing.
B0063M22QO|4.0|I love mahjong..keep your mind busy..my grand daughters love to play it also..keep up the good work..kudos all the way!!!
B0087EACJK|4.0|Played this game for a few minutes and enjoyed the experience<br /><br />I've only gotten through a few levels, but the movement in the game takes only a little time to get used to.
B009NY43NY|5.0|Never would I have guessed that Sookie would be shot, knifed, and kidnapped. The whole story from beginning to end was a real delight to read. I highly recommend this series
B009KEN87O|5.0|Just like the video games of yesteryear this game is a simple premise followed with lots of variation.<br />Keep shooting and zigzagging all over the phone/tablet that you're playing on.
B005K17RU0|2.0|do not upgrade<br /><br />REALLY Hate the layout, graphs and the MANY other  things on the last update.  Way to busy, hard to see and understand. put it back asap or I'm shopping for another wx app.  you aren't that great for me to waste time deciphering your app every time I open it.
B004ZMWUCU|5.0|Awesome, touching, heartbreaking, and joyfully.<br />This story had me crying and laughing out loud. Loved it. I will read more from this author.
B00B2V66VS|5.0|Love this game it is awesome my daughters love to play this game. It is so cool we play it all the time.
125000098X|2.0|First of all, Jeffrey Archer's books used to be very good.. I read the first two books in this trilogy and definitely thought the plots were far fetched and the characters were one dimensional (good hearts of gold or evil black hearts) I decided to give this third one a try because I didn't want to give up.  It was the worst of the three.  It drags along about Giles and his political career and when a semi-plot starts up about Sebastian,(who is also a very unlikable character...joining the rest) it ends with a cliffhanger.  The problem is....when an author has been good in the past, I am reluctant to give up on them, but I just don't know if I can weather a fourth installment unless I borrow it.
B0091REZMW|4.0|this game is okay. you use up energy very fast and it takes a while to gain again. easy to play.
B004ZMWUCU|5.0|This was one of the saddest books I have ever read. To think that things like this really happened sadden me even more. It is a book that everyone should read.
B004LOMB2Q|5.0|That's the point, Notepad everywhere.  I do not use the fancier features, but I use it every day.  It has become indispensable.
B00AAQWMB4|4.0|HINT: Read the Help Menu First.  It will save you from some frustration.  lol<br /><br />I am not familiar with the board game, Blokus, so I cannot compare the electronic version to the original version.<br /><br />The product description for this electronic version says that the play is intuitive, but I didn't find it to be so at first.  Luckily, there is a help menu that is very useful for learning how to play the game.  The phrasing is a bit odd at time (like an imperfect translation), but it is very understandable.  It is via the help menu that I learned how to rotate the pieces, something I wanted to do, but couldn't figure out how to make happen before I read the help.  At first, the game was a little frustrating, because I didn't understand how to rotate the pieces.  Once I read the help menu and went back to playing the game, however, playing was much more intuitive, and it became fun.  Maybe a more accurate statement would be that the game is intuitive for people who already know how to play the board game.<br /><br />A player is required to place a piece on the corner of one of their former pieces.  That is easy enough, but you also cannot place it next to the side edge of any of your pieces that are already in place.  And that is where the challenge lies.  When it is your turn, the computer places a small red dot in all of the squares that are available for play (a default setting named a \\"seeds display\\").  This is a useful feature for cutting down the amount of time required to learn how to play the game.  Since I'm a beginner, I'm glad I don't have to waste time identifying the possibilities.  Players can also elect to turn this off the seeds display via the options menu to make the game harder once they have gained some experience.<br /><br />Ultimately, this is a game that is fun and challenging.  I'm looking forward to mastering effective strategies, and beating the computer, at the various skill levels of the game.  It would be nice if the game included a hint feature to help you learn effective strategies.  It would also be nice if you could set the game up to play with fewer than four players, since this would help new players to learn effective strategies more quickly.  But for a free app of the day, this is an awesome discovery, and it will be a great way to pass the time during my commute.uded a hint feature to help you learn effective strategies.

B00CL68NOG|3.0|It was ok. renting through amazon didn't help the experience. poor video quality and it had to stop the movie to buffer every 5 minutes. Won't rent through amazon again.
B005ES1D40|3.0|this ones are very nice looking, very comfortable and tick sole, the  right one fit good but the left one seems to be a little small. I have other crocs and never had this problem before
B00006AW2S|5.0|This is one of, if not my favorite all time stones album. &#34;Have Mercy&#34; is great. I love this early Stones
B0038M2AZA|5.0|Anyone working with autistic students or have someone in their family must watch this movie.  I advise more than once!  &#34;We get up with the Rooster&#34;, autistic person thinks of &#34;getting up on the roof!&#34;  So many wonderful examples so don't miss them/<br />Autism is not easily understood but this movie &#34;shows&#34; you what it is like to be autistic.
B00821OX98|4.0|I enjoy good scifi shows and this series is well written and the concept is fresh. I like their use of american history as a base for their story. At times the acting is a bit cheesy and the special affects average but overall their is a real effort at maintaining a true sense of realism and believability. Looking forward to see what direction it takes in the 3rd season.
0007477155|5.0|It is beautifully packaged and the only way I was able to get volume 5.  I am re-reading volume 4 to acquaint myself again so I can start volume 5.  I think these are the best books I have ever read.
1742200508|5.0|I love the Lonely Planet books and feel I should say up front that I am not particularly a traveler. What the Lonely Planet books do is instill in me a longing to travel and the England book is no exception. I ordered this book through Vine particularly because it covers only England and not the UK as a whole. I find the maps accurate and easy to follow and enjoyed the proliferation of walking and biking tours. I also found the info in \\"England\\" to be solid and immutable. I am planning a UK trip but not this year. I know the info here will be just as good when I do make my trip and I found myself agreeing with recommendations based on my previous experiences.<br /><br />I thought the breakdown by area was well done and the familiarity of Welsh & Scottish border towns and countrysides in particular allowed for some flexibility in vacation planning if one does intend to cross out of England. I liked that there is no wasted historical information, only what's relevant to what you want to experience and why. I find that this book, like other Lonely Planet guides I've read, encourages you not only to see the sights but immerse yourself in the culture.<br /><br />This is the only travel book I've seen that says (repeatedly) you should put the book down and just soak in the country and its people. It's one to read before you go and pull out on occasion during the trip itself. I can't imagine needing another book on English travel unless you want something more specific about London. Thankfully \\"England\\" subtly reminds us that the nation is more than its capital.
B00AHXIC50|4.0|Overall, a very good CD.  It is different than most because Mars has some weird talent of being able to succeed at any style of music he attempts.  It's a nice buffet of pop, reggae, rock, etc.
B00AGOGOLE|5.0|I am a real novice when it comes to the Kindle and all it can do.  I bought the camera and LOVE it.  Didn't have directions on how to use, but easily figured it out.<br /><br />Thank you so very much!!!!!
B009GQ57ES|4.0|Good CD.  Very original and easy to listen to.  Only reason not rated 5 stars is because it isn't one of those CDs you can just play all the way through and be content...there are a few songs I usually skip because they are lacking what the rest of the CD has. I'm sure there will be many more great CDs to come.  Definitely worth the purchase...especially when it was on promotion for $1.99...now that is a HEIST!
B00633W614|5.0|Brilliant! I thoroughly enjoyed this book. An absolute page turner, just like volume one. I can't wait to read the next installment.
B0053O89RY|5.0|If you purchased this, you already love Modern Family so I am not going to go out of my way to explain the plot.  What I will commend is the speedy shipment of the seller.  A few days before Christmas, I ordered this for my parents since they love the show. I was worried that it wouldn't get to me in time and I am too cheap to select anything other than free shipping.  IT ARRIVED ON THE NEXT DAY! I was amazed. Bravo.  They put Jimmy Johns to shame.
B000QRIGLC|5.0|The closest you get to feeling how a real combat vet feels, not just in the heat of battle as so many war books are, bit in their love of country one each other. Several times I was in tears while reading. These men deserve all our respect and thanks, however you feel about the politics. There are times when we need well trained men & women willing to stand on the wall and defend our way of life. This book is a must read for any teenager growing up who needs to know that life is not always about video games, that sacrifice is sometimes required for all of us to be free.
B003521R6G|5.0|Very good and glad Kevin quoted from the bible about dancing.. The dancing and the music  was very entertaining. The actors and actresses all did a very good job on this movie.
B00CH87HF4|5.0|It is amazing fun but pay for advancing in a normal speed... it's only 1 of 2 downfalls. Space needed is the other, and that includes the time needed to download. If you enjoy Diablo or dungeon siege this your game!!!
B00COHAUD4|1.0|Watched because it was reviewed as a psychological thriller, it wasn't. Jessica Chastain was miscast or everyone else was, because there was &#34;no connect&#34; between her and all the supporting characters. Nothing was &#34;true&#34; therefore I couldn't suspend judgment and enjoy. Finally the end was ridiculous.
B005IYNQAY|5.0|Really enjoyed this sequel - very different to the first book in the series but still a lot of food for thought.
B009Q6ADG0|4.0|Adele, what can I say, she sing &#34;skyfall&#34; so emotionally and the passion she has for the song just pours out.
B0091REZMW|5.0|I love Mystery Manor. I have it on both of my tablets and my PC (Facebook), but it is VERY glitchy on my Android tablet and on my Kindle Fire. It doesn't load reliably and it crashes frequently. The uploads drive me crazy - only add more critters that run around blocking the screen, but not enough to block the objects in the Yard. I don't care about any Friend contacts - just want to play the game by myself but some of the quests are so friend-driven that I just ignore them. I'll continue to play, but please clean up the glitches!
B00BR476TG|2.0|Too dark . It is too dark to see the action on the screen. Another clip of day would be good.
B006M4F67A|4.0|Like the set up and for the most part is great. It does seem to hang up every once in a while and you have to start the game over. That is why I gave it 4 stars.
1616614609|5.0|The hype about this after GenCon last year was all over the place. I looked into it. It sounded interesting. The more reviews that I read, the more it became clear - I needed to try this. We purchased the core set and got to work learning the game.<br /><br />Android: Netrunner is a Living Card Game by Fantasy Flight set in a dystopian cyberpunk future. A LCG is different from a Collectible Card Game (think Magic: The Gathering) because there is no rarity. Everything that releases will give you every card, and will give you enough copies of the card to provide a full compliment for a deck. This was a big plus - I knew it wouldn't be the money sink that Magic was.<br /><br />The gameplay is deep, but the concept is simple. One player is the corporation, the other is the hacker. The job of the corporation is to introduce and complete various corporate agendas. The job of the runner is to hack in and &#34;steal&#34; these agendas. Each side has tools to make their job easier. The corporation can use various cards like a firewall to protect their servers, and the runner has programs and hardware designed to break through them. The game goes so much deeper than I can describe here. Suffice it to say that this is a very rich game, with many layers of strategy and tactical decision making that will bring hours of enjoyment even when you aren't playing.<br /><br />This is the most fun that I have had with a game since I first discovered Magic, and easily surpasses that level as well. It's just a deeper game than other similar card games, requiring more than just good deck construction. The depth of strategy is fascinating and enjoyable to discuss.<br /><br />I recommend this to anyone who has ever been curious about CCGs like Magic but balked at the price tag. I also recommend this to recovering Magic junkies. Trust me - this will scratch the itch without putting the same sort of dent in your wallet.
B006H3MIV8|3.0|Four CDs...there are many versions of Dylan's songs that I liked. But, unfortunately, there were also too many that I didn't like, were indeed hard to listen to. So that's why I gave the collection three stars.<br /><br />As a fan of Dylan's music, I realize that Dylan himself tinkered with the music. So any other artist trying to sing his songs may well feel it's OK to do the same. But, to me, Dylan has earned the right to fiddle with the music -- they're his tunes, after all. I feel that it shows disrespect for others to take liberties with the music. Oh, it's fine to add nuance to the melodies. But many of the songs in this collection -- too many, in my opinion -- completely depart from Dylan's melodies. To me, the songs come as a package of lyrics and music. Don't mess with the words; don't mess with the melody. Unless your name is Bob Dylan.
B005S9EKCW|5.0|After hearing so much abut this movie, I had some doubts!!  But friends and I absolutely loved!!<br />I'm really glad I bought the movie, and CD together!!!  A great buy!!

B00A80SHFM|5.0|Really love this CD...bought both the movie and this Cd!!  Felt there are enough great songs included!!<br />5 Stars absolutely!!
B003KK6GOQ|5.0|When I first began reading I wasn't sure I would be able to follow the story with just letters - until I read a letter that grabbed my interest and I haven't been able to put it down.  It's very easy to love the characters and get into the story.
B005K17RU0|5.0|I love the app !! It is the most accurate weather app. I recomend theese to people who are tired of checking wrong weather prodictions !!! LOL
0452289963|5.0|I  purchased this book in 2008, later I purchased The Power of Now and Practicing the Power of Now.<br />I pick one of them up on a daily basis and read at least a sentence (maybe a whole chapter) and never<br />seem to stop Awakening to My Life's Purpose.
B006DJ2JSI|5.0|Very nice tool and very useful.  This is a very easy to use application as well as very helpful for anyone.
B00BEZTMQ8|4.0|I had already purchased the hobbit from walmart but my dog chewed up the case andd i saw that they had a good deal on amazon so i decided to purchase it. I was under the impression that it was the same as the one i bought from walmart but when i got it the case was different. i must have gotten the special edition from walmart. all in all its still the hobbit movie and i love it. great adventure to take.
B00AFCEIB0|4.0|I love the application.  It is very easy to use, very friendly user and very helpful.  Certainly a great tool.
B003L77GGK|5.0|I've always been a fan of Supernatural, it's on my top 5 favorite tv show list and I recently set out to buy all of the seasons on DVD. Can't beat this price. Great season. 100% satisfied with my purchase.

B0083ZBW2Y|4.0|It was pretty good. I liked the way Jack wrote and would probably recommend it. My favorite chapter is 6, For the love of a Man.
B00992CF6W|5.0|I love this game its just as good as pc and Xbox but more portable. Easy to play and very addictive. Totaly worth the money. You have to buy this game its totaly amazing. Even my 5 year old sister loves it. If she does you might so you should buy it. If you liked this say it was helpful.
B009CWWFD2|5.0|Have to relish his writings bit by bit as I have read about everything he has.  Please allow some of your writing to be allowed for electronic distribution to public libraries
B009UX2YAC|5.0|I love this game but I can't really get slot of coins can you give some? But it's still a pretty good game nice job
B0089EHWQE|4.0|Helped facilitate interesting discussion about life as a para/quadrapalegic. Main characters' and family  relationships were also intriguing. Thought the author did a good job portraying the lives of very different families from varying backgrounds and  socioeconomic levels.
B0091REZMW|3.0|You are right it's so hard to see if I could zoom into this game it would be so much better.
B00C7KXUOE|5.0|This show is so well done. The acting is amazing and the cinematography is breath-taking. Sure, there's murder and cannibalism, but it's hard not to like Hannibal even as he eats people. Watch it and I sincerely doubt you'll be disappointed.
B0024FADDI|5.0|This one is my favorite of the three. Maybe its because Bruce Campbell really owns his character, or it seems to have a more involved script. Either way it seems to come together better.
B004S3MB2U|3.0|Good calculator has tons of features, I don't use it often, but am glad I have it when I needed the more advanced features in it.
B000WC3864|5.0|I don't think the new one will be like the original, so I'm rewatching it before I see the new one.
B008I3RARW|1.0|Cars are all the same, just different paint schemes, only one track available, competition stinks, first race I came in first by more than 20 seconds.
B005J9ZFQG|5.0|So I rewatched the 1st one. Now I have to watch them all...they are so bad that they are great...
B00AAQRNQ8|4.0|LIGHTS!  There is indeed a way to change the color of the light on the mouse but only on the logo.  The wheel and the DPI light always stay blue which make it completely pointless to change the logo color to say red.  Also the logo is covered by your hand so you usually don't even see the color of the light you changed.<br />Seriously though other than my annoyance with this slight design problem this is a superb mouse.  Very smooth, the ergonomic design fits your hand perfectly, and the extra mouse buttons are very useful when playing various games (and even while surfing the web).  The cable is a decent length (6ft) and i haven't had any problems as it is very durable.<br />In summary, 4 stars simply because the light issue was not as advertised but overall an excellent mouse for the cost.
B004HW7JH4|5.0|Got this one to catch up and get ready for season six. Now, I'm hoping it's even better this season.
076115728X|5.0|I love the message of this book, for I am a bit of a perfectionist and hate making mistakes. But maybe if I had a book like this, I wouldn't be like that today.<br />This book is beautifully done.  It is interactive for the little ones and uses simple language. Is is also filled with fun colors and drawings.<br />I look forward to sharing this book with my daughter.
B00B2QA646|1.0|I couldn't even get through watching it.  I was hoping I would get used to how this was presented as I watched, but I couldn't.  My wife told me she couldn't watch it any more after 35 minutes and I so tried to continue to watch it.  Ultimately I decided it was time to turn it off.  Hard to follow the dialog, hard to follow the story, and so disappointed.  Unfortunate choice of movie to spend money on.
B00CMAK34O|5.0|I don't get some of the more negative reviews that this album has recieved by critics carping that it is not edgy or innovative enough. This is Agnetha Faltskog people not Bjork!One of the great pop vocalist of her generation and since that voice has lost none of it's magic and ability to touch the heart any generation.There are some stunning performances here \\" I Was A Flower\\"  contains all the melancholy and pathos of  any ballad on Super Trouper or The Visitors.\\"The One Who Loves You Now\\" sounds like a lost ABBA track from the mid 1970s.Even the more average songs here are made special by Agnetha's  masterful performance.This album is an unexpected gem.I hope that it leads to more music from Agnetha but even if it  does not it would serve as beautiful swan song to an incredible career.
B00AAQWMB4|4.0|Update: Stupid me, I finally figured out what is going on with the app's \\"Help Menu\\" on the Kindle!!!<br /><br />The app developers customized an icon in the Kindle \\"Soft Key Menu\\" which is located at the bottom of the Kindle screen.  Normally the Soft Key Menu has icons for Home, Back, Search and Favorites, but the developers added functionality to the icon that looks like a piece of paper.  If you click on this icon you get the app options for Flip Piece, Undo, New Game, Help and Settings.<br /><br />************************<br />Below is original review<br />************************<br />Don't know if something happened during my install or if there is a bug with Kindle HD Fire OS, but I can't get the Help to open.  It flashes on the screen for a second but then goes away.  If I quickly try to press or swipe the Help screen it goes directly to the playing board.  Also there is no way to quit a game and start over.  If I tell it to quit it just closes the app.  When I reopen the app it is back on the same game.<br /><br />But thanks to all the other reviewers I was able to figure out how to play this game.  Thanks everyone.  And it is a fun game.  Challenging.  Takes a lot of careful strategizing to win.<br /><br />Here is a brief summary on how to play (I think):  You don't fit your blocks together like in Tetris, you can only attach them at the corner points.  But you can fit (tetris style) your block against other players blocks.  There is also a large grayish circle that appears when you pull a block onto the playing screen.  Within the gray circle are four other gray circles.  You can touch any of the inner circles to rotate the blocks.  If a block is placed correctly a green check appears and you can press it to accept the play.  The game ends when you no longer have any plays.  You can also press the colored bars down at the bottom and change the color or the blocks you want to play.<br /><br />Easy playing rules once they are shown/explained once.  Wish I could have gotten the Help screen to open.could have gotten the Help screen to open.
B003XF1XOQ|5.0|I read all three books in under a week, happily losing sleep to keep the pages turning! A great trilogy!
B00A0SLTCU|2.0|Some review of this film that I read said various good things, various bad things, and ultimately concluded that the remake was \\"unnecessary\\".<br />Well, that's pretty much true of remakes in general, isn't it?  In Hollywood, you can't come up with anything new very often, or can't sell it anyway, so many of the movies are either standard genre productions, sequels (Rocky XXXX.....), or sometimes a remake.  For instance, \\"Cape Fear\\" with DeNiro was actually pretty good, perhaps better than the original in some ways, maybe not as good in others, but it wasn't really necessary.  Take those actors and that director, give them a good original script, and they could also have done a pretty good film.<br /><br />Rarely does anyone make a remake of a film that didn't work the first time.  One case was the remake of \\"The Shining\\"; the Jack Nicholas version was brilliant, a classic, or an over-the-top nightmare according to who you ask, and I guess somebody thought they could do better.  They were wrong.  You know what I'd like to see remade?  GWTW!  A modern take on those events would be very interesting.<br /><br />The Scwarzenegger \\"Total Recall\\" was terrific.  It's pretty far from Philip Dick's story \\"We can remember it for you wholesale\\", but makes good use of the basic idea, and personally I think it's brilliant.  It's a lot of fun, and very watchable.  It's some kind of minor cult classic in any case.  Did these people think they could do better, or were they just cashing in by rehashing?  Well, the new  film is somewhat watchable, somewhat entertaining, has some good stuff in it, so that's why it's worth two stars.  The acting and direction are acceptable, the effects are pretty good, but it does go on way too long.  On the other hand, it has a lot wrong with it, which is what I want to talk about, and really it doesn't add anything.  I haven't seen the director's cut, but this version is already too long, so I wouldn't be very interested in dragging it out even more.<br /><br />First of all, the \\"worldwide use of chemical weapons\\" has put \\"living space at a premium\\" and there are \\"only two places left\\"-- Britain, and \\"The Colony\\", which is Australia.  Workers commute every day from Britain to Australia by this thing called the \\"Fall\\", which seems to be a giant skyscraper that travels through the earth, through the core, to get to the other side.  (btw, everyone in Britain and Australia seems to have an American accent for some reason.  All the main characters are white too, even more so than the original.  I remember at least there was that black taxi driver).<br />Where to start on the problems with this idea?  Well, it's cumbersome, far-fetched, unnecessary, ridiculous and stupid, but let's not focus on that.<br />There are a couple of technical points I want to bring up, though.<br /><br />One, Britain and Australia are NOT directly opposite each other on the globe.  The antipodal point for Australia is in the North Atlantic.  The one for Britain is near Antarctica.  So the point is, a tunnel from one to the other would not go through the core.<br />Two, these commuters going to the Colony every day, assuming it is directly antipodal, are commuting 8000 miles one way.  At 1000 mph, the trip would take 8 hours, adding up to a 16 hour round-trip commute.  Might just as well live on the Fall, or live where you work, better yet.  In fact, the trip appears to take only a few minutes.  If you make it a one-hour trip, which gives you a fairly arduous but quite do-able two hours every day commuting, the thing must be going 8000 mph.  If you can go that fast, you can travel to other planets.<br />In fact, three, if you had the technology to build a subway straight through the planet, you could do all sort of things, such as, for example, a regular tunnel in which a high-speed train goes a long way at a high speed WITHOUT going through the molten core of the planet!  Or you could re-terraform the planet, or build  space colonies or huge underground cities, or anything besides this cockamamie idea.<br /><br />Other than that, it's basically the same plot as the original Total Recall, except dragged out to the point of stupor.  And perhaps the biggest flaw is, you know absolutely nothing about the Colony, don't meet any of its inhabitants, so why should you care?  In the original, you met a lot of mutants, and they were interesting and sympathetic.  You don't want to see them die of anoxia.<br /><br />There are a few touches that are maybe nice, such as the \\"two weeks\\" scene or the \\"drop of sweat\\" scene (or maybe they're not so great, maybe the original was better; in any case, they depend on you having seen the original.)  The three-breasted woman makes no sense at all without the other mutants.  In fact, if you just leave the plot the way it is, Mars, mutants and all, it makes much more sense and works much better.  There are also a lot of things that happen that, if you had time to notice, don't make sense-- why, when the hero is trying to take the Recall trip, do a dozen armed storm troopers instantly show up?  Why lots of little things like that?<br />Above all, why does this damned thing go on so long?<br /><br />In the original, Sharon Stone was blond, and the other girlfriend was dark-haired, so you could tell them apart in the fight scene.  Here, the two of them are both dark-haired, look quite a bit alike, and they have MULTIPLE fight scenes; I could never tell which was which.  Not that I cared.  In the original, you could care about the mutants.  Free Mars!  But here, you don't know a damned thing about the Colony, or Britain either for that matter, and there's no reason to care.  It might make a good video game.  As a film, I can't see what it adds to the original.  In fact, the original is much, much better, and I'd stick with that.
B0063GORYU|2.0|The probabilities are nuts.  Level 1 (1 suit of cards) is almost impossible to lose if you have played before.<br />Level 2 varies wildly with the luck of the draw.  Sometimes easy, sometimes impossible, but generally a good challenge.<br />Level 3-4 might be possible (with incredibly good luck) if you are a world-class expert at it, but I have never even gotten close.<br />Actually just set it at 4 suits and fail a couple times, you will see this game needs developing.<br /><br />Play 1 suit, to learn the game, play 2 suits as standard after that.  Play 3-4 if you need to get frustrated!
B00AHGSVKS|4.0|I often think my own views regarding how this world will fare in the future are based on this terrific tale. I am particularly drawn to the ending and what transpires regarding the children. (I won't give any more spoilers, however!) So many &#34;space&#34; tales that I read or saw after reading this in high school seem inspired by this book.
B000P0J09M|1.0|This stupid DVD was scratched. I could NOT have been more upset to get it, start watching it and have it just STOP right at one of my favorite parts. UGH.
B00C7KYXHW|4.0|This show is so good that I fear it won't make it past this season -- or maybe one more -- on network tv.  Good stories, great acting, amazing production values. It's definitely not for everyone; the graphic nature of the killings is pretty terrifying. But it's as good as most HBO series, maybe not as edgy language-wise. It's really good.
0143113100|4.0|The Brain That Changes Itself by Norman Doidge, M.D. provides examples of how neuroscience is developing and evolving in relation to the idea of plasticity.  This book is the result of countless research done in the field of neuroscience by Doidge and his genuine interest in learning the stories presented about plasticity.  Doidge garnered interest in this subject as a Canadian educated psychiatrist and psychoanalyst and author of many papers and articles ranging from plasticity to poetry.  In The Brain That Changes Itself, Doidge focuses his interests specifically on the ability of the brain to rearrange itself.  The book contains numerous case studies which illustrate the claim that the brain remains plastic throughout life and can take over functions that were previously thought to be lost provided the right amount of retraining and learning.  The Brain That Changes Itself contains more than 80 pages of scientific references, yet has become a popular read among both those within and outside of the scientific field as evidenced by its status as a New York Times Bestseller.  As I read this book, I became drawn into the topic presented and saw Doidge's writing style as a particularly engaging way to approach the topic, but was a little concerned about how the book would flow together with case studies being presented consecutively and no true story line.  However, I realized that the case studies help to drive home the underlying message of the desire to further explore the possibilities of how the brain can change itself.  Overall, I found the book to be enjoyable and tough to put down once I got into the flow if it.<br /><br /> The main focus of The Brain That Changes Itself is the revolutionary and controversial idea of neuroplasticity. There are numerous opinions with scientists and the general public choosing to stick to one side or the other.  In recent times, the idea of brain plasticity has become more and more acceptable compared to where it was early on inthe development of this field.  The brain has been found to be able to rewire itself and change what has been long believed to be a fixed system.  Throughout the book, Doidge shows different aspects of plasticity ranging from the old to the young in addition to the results following traumatic injuries and biological malfunction.  Doidge paints a picture of this relatively new and potentially limitless idea that could revolutionize brain science as it is known today.<br /><br /> The Brain That Changes Itself is a collection of case studies where individuals have shown the ability to rewire their brain activity as a result of brain damage or addiction. This book covers topics ranging from balance to sexuality and beyond.  Most of the book focuses on how the brain can change itself at points much later in life than previously thought possible.  There are also additional stories of how certain areas of the brain can take over for an area that is missing or has been damaged at some point during an individual's lifetime.  The case studies provide insight into the world of brain plasticity, but are written in such a way so as to engage the reader without requiring them to have an extensive background in the scientific field.  Doidge presents each of the studies as a story with an integral part to play in the developing story of neuroplasticity.<br /><br /> As I began to read the stories presented by Doidge, I was uneasy about how I was going to respond to the topics presented.  The idea of presenting consecutive case studies as a way to build a story through a book did not seem to jive with my fancy.  However, as I continued to read the stories that Doidge wrote and learn more about the research in the field of plasticity, I found myself unable to put the book down.  I found myself constantly desiring to know what could possibly come next.  The stories were fascinating as I was taken on a journey through all the possibilities of what brain plasticity presents.  At first,I was presented with a case study about a woman who was in a constant state of feeling as if she was perpetually falling.  This wreaked havoc in her life and prevented her from doing normal activities including holding a steady job.  However, research in neuroscience showed way in which the brain could be retrained to make her feel \\"normal\\" again.  This process started slowly and eventually grew on her to the point of where she lives a fairly normal life and with only a few relapses here and there as a result of retraining or rewiring the brain to work in the way it did before.  Later in the book, I was introduced to people with parts of their brain rendered inactive by stroke or just plain missing a part of the whole.  These individuals were also able to have functioning lives as areas typical to a given function often were changed or converted and brain maps began to emerge and change as time progressed.<br /><br /> As I made my way through the book, I began to realize that all of the stories played a role in the larger picture.  Each story was individual in terms of the problems presented, but the general themes were the same.  Going into the book, I did not expect to have such an engaging experience reading over multiple case studies in a row.  I thought the book would be disjointed and difficult to follow, but Doidge does a masterful job of connecting the case studies together to better articulate the idea of neuroplasticity.  The Brain That Changes Itself tells the story of the development of the field of neuroplasticity and the research that goes into it.  The reader is able to gain interest in the subject and hear about the ways in which the brain is such a complex organ that scientists continue to dive into and discover more about.  The Brain That Changes Itself provides powerful insight into what the future of neuroscience could be and how the field continues to develop.  I give it 4.5 stars out of 5.

B008Y212PI|5.0|I so enjoy these puzzles. The pictures are beautiful. This is the second set of puzzles I have purchased..and plan to be back for more.
B008673ZAQ|5.0|I love this author and the storyline of these characters.  It is not the healthiest relationship and I would run for dear life if this was real, but it is one heck of a story.  You identify with both of the main love interests and want so badly for them to work out that you could reach into the pages and strangle them yourself at points in the dialogue. If you want a great sexy page turner to cuddle up with - this is your series.
B005K17RU0|5.0|This app gives you live updates on the cities you choose. You have 24 hour listing of your weather at every hour, day to day forecast, real feel, wind, and live radar. And so much more. By far the best weather app I have purchased.
B0083Z614S|4.0|This book has good story content, however some of the characters are a bit exaggerated.  It has a satisfying conclusion for the reader and makes a good point, that is that thinking the wrong thoughts and acting on them can cause much harm to the thinker.
B00AEQYM6S|5.0|This was a great performance. He really has a fantastic voice and I would recommend this to any Wagner lover.
B0017SWPXY|5.0|A friend recommended this book.  When I started to read it I couldn't figure out why she recommended it but the more I read I loved it.
B002N5N4M6|5.0|No review needed, the show speaks for itself.  Hilarious! Best show on tv by far.  Sick of reality shows which should be banned from tv.
B00COGZ8FU|5.0|The character of Jack Reacher from the Lee Child book series is a superhero at heart. Cruise plays up all his strengths and does the character justice. I would recommend this movie to anyone who enjoys action, detective work, Tom Cruise, and military elements.
B008ASLK8A|5.0|Normally after i see a movie once in theaters, im satisfied and will wait till blu ray release. Not this movie, it made me come back again which ive only had the urge to do to a few select movies.
B001EYU1VO|3.0|Son loves it, only 1month old and already has a broke button, not very durable. Should hold up better than that.
B001KVZ6HK|5.0|I was skeptical at first with the new guy as the hulk since hes my favorite character out of the group. Thankfully once i got into the movie, i came to realize the new Hulk was a very big improvement and the movie all together was amazing!
0374531269|5.0|This book is frightening and sad.  It is true and opens your eyes to the terrors in the world we sometimes don't think about here in the U.S.  As a parent, I wish to just scoop these children up and help them, but that isn't how it works.  They have become unstable and slightly dangerous and it is good to see there are people out there that know how to help them
B00004R997|3.0|There seems to be a difference of opinion as to the running time of this film.  They run from 44 minutes to 75 minutes.  Even the experts and personnel at Disney can't come to a final agreement.
B00BMKDTNC|4.0|Quite a bit of Sanderson's personal style shines through in this last volume.  It's a better book for it.  A good read.
B005PK57IK|5.0|If you like legal shows... this is one the better ones... other that Boston Legal, and Ally Mcbeal... this is very interesting shows.
B001HMSFFC|5.0|One of the best movies to ever be created from a TV series! If you have never seen it you should give it a go!
1423389387|5.0|This is the 2nd book in the Kingkiller Chronicles (which is also the 2nd day in which Kvothe tells of his story). I loved the first book and would have to say I love this one a little bit more. It goes in more depth on Kvothe's life and how he became a famous name in tales told throughout the lands. He becomes more experienced... in love, fighting, killing, etc. The only downfall is we don't learn much more about the Chandrian or the Amyr. This is somewhat disappointing being that I'm on the edge of my seat wondering what the full story is. I guess it just makes me more excited in seeing book three come out. I will be on the edge of my seat until then. Highly recommended. Rothfuss has such a beautiful way with words!
B0054JZC6E|5.0|excellent app. different level of challengefor each gamrw makes it an engaging app. woulld highly recvomend to all my friends. rate an a plus.
B002UBRFDC|5.0|Couldn't get enough. I only wish the story could have gone further and discussed the coming battle. It will keep you on the edge and you will want to continue reading late into the night.
B004SRPXWQ|5.0|I downloaded this talking cat because it was a free app. Although silly, most people can't get enough of him. My 5 year old Granddaughter had fun with it for about a half hour, and people I work with get a great laugh when touching his tail for feet. This free app is a keeper.
B001LF3YQK|5.0|Best wipes case I've found. Wipes don't easily dry out and very convenient to open.  Red slide can come off so be careful not too lose it.

B00BBA6FOI|5.0|A wonderful, thoughtful and encouraging book for all women standing on the threshold of a career-making or breaking decision. Sheryl Sandberg makes you feel like you can prioritise your life and still rise into leadership in the workplace. I thoroughly enjoyed her viewpoint and it made me feel like a had a very wise and powerful mentor in my corner. I needed this insight and Sheryl Sandberg delivered
B0094BB4TW|5.0|I love my facebook i can keep in touch with friends and families I don't get to see very often

B008K8VDPU|5.0|This app is really fun. You can play more than one note at a time it is awesomeness buy this app it will blow your mind
B004UHL9EK|5.0|It's a great app. I've used other apps that have timers and none have the flexibility of this app. I could argue it's got too many options which makes the navigation a little more complicated than I would like, but the extra options make this my go to apps for timers.
0786939532|3.0|R.A. Salvatore's Drizzt novels are great if you're looking for a quick, fun fantasy read. They're not literary masterworks by any means, but I don't think Salvatore would even claim they are. Homeland tells the story of Drizzt Do'urden, a young drow elf who is a member of a prominent noble family living in a dark elf city deep underground. Drizzt is conditioned from birth to follow the drow's culture of deceit, espionage, and brutality. However, Drizzt is not like his fellow drow, and disagrees with the culture of hate and warfare that pervades the Underdark. Homeland follows Drizzt as he trains and eventually defects from Menzoberranzan, the vile city of his birth. Salvatore is great at providing fast paced and action packed battle scenes. If you're looking for complex characters and deep thematic elements, you probably won't find them. However, if you're looking for a nice change of pace between meatier reads and something that you can finish in a few days, Homeland is for you.
B009NY43NY|5.0|I have read the entire series and this was one of the best wrap up books to a series ever. I'm going to miss Sookie
B007TBZ63Y|5.0|Great twist and turns. Kept me on edge every chapter. Cant wait for the next one to be released soon!
1607066017|5.0|I bought this book on a whim and absolutely love it. The characters are well written and complex and the story is unique. I would recommend this to anyone.
B000Q9IZ5C|5.0|Nice edition to my Firefly collection.  Of course I would buy the 14 dvd set of expanded words from Joss if it was for sale!
B008SAZHLQ|5.0|Read this and other reviews at [...]<br /><br />I don't even know how to begin to describe this book. Or review it. Or gush about it enough. It was so incredibly refreshing, honest, painful, and beautiful that my words wouldn't even scratch the surface of awesome. Eleanor + Park was my first experience with Rainbow Rowell's writing, and it will not be the last. She's made a HUGE fan of me.<br /><br />I'll admit, I started this book not long after it came out. Life took over, other books took over, and I worried I'd never pick it back up. How could that be given the glowing recommendations by some of my FAVORITE authors. Finally, I picked it up, and almost immediately, I was SUCKED IN. Big time. Huge. Could barely put it down. As in, I was in the bank drive through, and reading on my phone while I waited for the teller. OB-SESSED.<br /><br />{{Holding Eleanor's hand was like holding a butterfly. Or a heartbeat. Like holding something complete, and completely alive.<br />As soon as he touched her, he wondered how he'd gone this long without doing it. He rubbed his thumb through her palm and up her fingers, and was aware of her every breath.}}<br /><br />This story reminded me of being sixteen. And being in love. And what you feel and what you think you know. And how you really can't control anything because you're sixteen. You have rules to follow. And school. And parents. And the social norms just dictate a lot for you. This is where the story was so real. I think, oftentimes in books, sixteen year olds live lives that are kinda unrealistic, especially when it comes to their love interests and dating. This is SO not the case with this story. It's so real and honest that it hurts. A week after finishing it, I'm still thinking about. Thinking about the characters, and their story, and their lives.<br /><br />{{Eleanor was right. She never looked nice. She looked like art, and art wasn't supposed to look nice; it was supposed to make you feel something.}}<br /><br />All that being said, my heart BROKE for Eleanor. Her home life was horrible, but she somehow was still such a real girl, and really tried to rise above. Then she meets Park, whose home life is the exact opposite. This isn't the story of him necessarily saving her. I think they both sort of saved each other.<br /><br />I was so in love with every aspect of this story. The characters were so developed, the writing was heartbreaking, but also so, so witty. I love the banter between Eleanor and Park and their sarcasm and dry humor. I love that you fell in love right along with them. I found myself highlighting passages on almost every other page. I couldn't stop. The writing was magic. It's probably some of the best kissing scenes ever. Forget that. Hand holding. Something as simple as holding hands is electric. Rainbow's talent far exceeds anything I could imagine. Her writing jumps off the page, and you're so immersed and feeling, that you're in it. You are living, breathing this story.<br /><br />{{\\"What do you want to show me?\\"<br />\\"Nothing, really. I just want to be alone with you for a minute.\\"<br /><br />He pulled her to the back of the driveway, where they were almost completely hidden by a line of trees and the RV and the garage.<br /><br />\\"Seriously?\\" she said. \\"That was so lame.\\"<br /><br />\\"I know,\\" he said, turning to her. \\"Next time, I'll just say, `Eleanor, follow me down this dark alley, I want to kiss you.'\\"<br /><br />She didn't roll her eyes. She took a breath, then closed her mouth. He was learning how to catch her off guard.<br /><br />She pushed her hands deeper in her pockets, so he put his hands on her elbows. \\"Next time,\\" he said, \\"I'll just say, `Eleanor, duck behind these bushes with me, I'm going to lose my mind if I don't kiss you.\\"}}<br /><br />I read an interview Rainbow gave, in which she said that basically, at sixteen, you don't have happy endings, you only have great beginnings. This is soooo ridiculously true, and couldn't be a more perfect way to describe what she wrote. I will say, even though I appreciated the realness of the story, part of me just wonders what if ... I can't say I'd love to see a sequel, because really, it was just so perfect, but the other part of me wants to know so, so badly what went on to happen to them years down the road. I can't recommend this book enough. You'll remember so much about being young, and hopefully being in love.<br /><br />{{\\"I just can't believe that life would give us to each other,' he said, `and then take it back.'<br />`I can,' she said. `Life's a bastard.\\"}}onders what if ...

B008Y2FRFO|5.0|Reminds me of playing the game in Reno at the casinos. Addictive and fun!! Even more so when we challenge each other!
B007S7U4AY|5.0|Cuando empiezas a leer este fantástico libro y vas avanzando en él, te das cuenta de que quieres saber con interés cóo termina lo más pronto posible, puesto que con un lenguaje y unos personajes totalmente cotidianos, en el sentido que todos conocemos a alguien parecido a alguno de ellos que se expresa de la misma manera, la novela se convierte en un paseo excepcional por la vida y los secretos de los protagonistas, algo que por otro lado todos tenemos.<br /><br />Un libro que por el precio que cuesta, es prácticamente imprescindible tenerlo en un e-book y cuando terminas de leerlo te das cuenta que has hecho una excelente compra

B00BWBHIUG|5.0|I love it. It is colorful, addicting and very peaceful. I just wish pearls were easier to get... but still, five stars
B002MQYOFW|4.0|The Hunger Games is a good story. The plot line is kind of dark, and it took me a while to get over the author's writing style and the first-person narrative view to actually enjoy the book. However, the story was very intriguing, the characters are well-built, and it is easy to put yourself in the characters' shoes. I definitely enjoyed this book.
B009UZBLSG|5.0|It works as expected. I am using it with Nexus 4 connecting to a LG Monitor TV. I tried and it also works well with an Apple HDMI-to-DVI adapter.
B008MBXFEM|5.0|I find movie scores very useful for relaxing or background music for studying. Hans Zimmer knocks it out of the park again with this one!
B008LC8TJI|5.0|Just a heads up...if you are buying this album the song PAYPHONE is very explicit...even using the F word. They do NOT have the radio version of this song which I loved so much..
B009NY43NY|1.0|I thought that this book would tie up all loose ends, and of course the major question of whom Sookie will choose after being with almost every man in her town. So she ends up choosing the dog, out of them all. Which throws you for a loop because, I don't know, she was with delicious Eric Northman for say nine books? Such a terrible plot, wasn't interesting...<br /><br />All in all,<br />Don't read you'll be disappointed. Sookie it's not your fault. :(
B000P2A256|5.0|I  love the album and it came in perfect condition, Ok, I couldn't wait to get their latest CD. If you like Maroon 5, then you will like their latest CD. I have this in my Car and it is one of my new fave CD's

B0015RDGD0|5.0|Good story line with character development.  Exciting action scenes with some action shots lifted from The Matrix.  Recommended for action fans.
B00C2IJJE6|5.0|No matter how many times I see this film, it never loses its power.  I have had the Standard Def version for a long time and just bought the Steelbook on Blu Ray. Glad I did.  It was up for 7 Oscars and, criminally, didn't win one.  I won't be redundant and go through a summary of the storyline and sub plots, discussions of the acting,book, etc.  It's been done so I will only focus on the quality of the transfer itself.<br /><br />VIDEO....The transfer to blu ray is as clean as you can expect it to be.  There were no artifacts or film stock dirt anywhere that I could see though I doubt if this is a complete remastering of the film.  The color grading tends to produce muted colors, often somewhat desaturated to match the bleakness of the prison environment.  Contrast on the Blu Ray has definitely been boosted and improved from what I can see comparing it to the Standard Def release.  Details in background scenes tend to be a bit soft but are razor sharp in many of the close ups.  Details in dark scenes are not hidden behind crushed blacks making for a good video transfer.<br /><br />AUDIO.... This is more of a dialogue driven film so do not expect much coming from your surround speakers or your sub.  There are some left and right foley from the front sides and the rears are used somewhat for that ambient echo of doors closing and cell bars sliding shut but that is about it.  The lossless Dolby True HD 5.1 audio does provide for a very clean and transient dialogue, easy to hear and understand even in whispering moments.  Lossless audio, even when the full theater system is not in use, still provides a much more transparent listening environment.<br /><br />EXTRAS...Can't say I have watched them all yet but there are plenty of good extras here.  I did watch the 1/2 'Hope Springs Eternal' extra and found it very interesting and moving as well. There is a great parody of Shawshank Redemption call 'Sharktank Redemption' that is a must to watch and is dedicated to production/film agent assistants. It's excellent.  I look forward to seeing the others. The trailer is also in high def and there is a comic spoof on the film which I have yet to watch as well as a collection of stills, storyboards and more.<br /><br />If you don't already own this film on Standard Def, why not?  If you do, get the Blu Ray anyway as it is well worth it and will remain an iconic film with legs for years to come.<br /><br />All my reviews focus solely on the quality of the transfers to Blu Ray of both video and audio and I do hope that this review has been of some help to you in deciding upon your purchase decisions and that I am on the correct path with this type of review.<br />Thanks for reading.on/film agent assistants.

B00CATSONE|2.0|I am not sure what she group this was for and maybe it is for younger readers and that is why I didn't like it. It reminded me of an extended term paper. However I did enjoy the biographical part of the book. Tesla has an amazing story and I am grateful for the free book.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|This game is one of the best I have ever play on the Kindle. I could play this game for hours.
B001GQ2BNQ|3.0|I chose this snokel because it had been recommended to me as being easier than a side snorkel.  The side snorkel takes time to adjust and you have to play with it for a while to get it right.  This snorkel is easier to put on but it does slip out of place after a few laps and needs to be pulled back.  My main complaint is that it doesn't cover ny nose so I have to concentrate constantly to keep from breathing with my nose.  I tried using nose pinches but they all slip off when you get in the water. So if I forget or cough I end up swallowing water.  To me one of the best parts of swimming besides the physical benefits, is the mind drifting relaxation, but with this snorkel it is impossible to relax.  If I do relax and lose my concentration , I usually end up taking in water.  I am planning to go back to my side snorkel tomorrow.
0316781630|4.0|A detailed lesson on customs, culture, faith relations in India. An entertaining book, each chapter opens up a new colorful aspect of interrelations in the Indian subcontinent. Definitely enjoyable.<br />My only regret is, that it is not available in an electronic form, the book is thick and heavy with over 1,700 pages.

193700788X|3.0|Parts of this book I loved.  Parts of this book had me scratching my head wondering what was going on.  Some of the bits I felt were five stars, some were a dismal one star.  I averaged out the book and decided to give it three stars.  I'm not surprised who Sookie ended up with.  I saw the writing on the wall in book one, and Harris had dropped little one liners in almost every book about how Sam had featured in some of Sookie's more intense fantasies.  I'm disappointed in the rushed style of this book, but I guess that's kind of the nature of the beast.  I have felt like that after almost every Sookie book, so why should this one be the exception?? Some things I really enjoyed about this book:<br />1. The support from Sookie's community made me feel that she really was a special member of her community and that she was finally accepted.<br />2. Pam.  All of Pam.  I love Pam.<br />3. Terry's wrap up.  I know he is such a minor character in the series, but it made me so happy that he got a HEA.<br />4. Interestingly enough, I enjoyed some of the third person perspectives tossed in.<br />5. Vampires do in fact have souls.<br />Some things that I really didn't enjoy about this book:<br />1. Sookie/Sam sex scene was written SO. FREAKING. AWKWARD.  I mean, Harris used the word \\"plunge\\" when describing it.  Seriously.  It was so awkward to read.<br />2. Cope using a wish to get an object that he could use for a wish.  Ummm.... why not use your wish to get what you want instead of getting another object to fulfill your original desire?  So confused by that.  It was a poor plot device used to get yet another person against Sookie, and honestly, this book didn't need it.  It was already too rushed.<br />3. Eric.  I didn't think they would end up together and that's not what bothered me.  I actually might have been disappointed if Sookie ended up with him because it went against her character.  However, Eric was NOT in character for this book.  And I feel like we all deserveda better wrap up on him then an \\"I rescind your invitation,\\" and some dialogue from Pam letting Sookie know that Eric wasn't too emotionally attached to her.  Umm.  He wasn't?  Because I remember several books back, Eric was upset by having feelings.  When he lost his memory, he was all about staying with Sookie forever.  When he eventually remembered that time together, why wouldn't he remember those intense feelings he had for her??  Not to mention, he is the only one consistently in the series who has tried to protect her no matter what.  We are told that his children look and act a lot like Sookie, and Eric absolutely loves his children.  And he loved Sookie enough to NOT turn her against her will.  That's huge.  But nope.  We aren't even given a proper send off for Eric and I feel that he is miserable in OK and that makes me a little sad.  Maybe we'll see something different when the final wrap up comes out in October (frankly I'm hoping for a full on Eric take over in OK).  Fingers crossed.<br />4. Sookie went from dropping the \\"f\\" bomb more in this book than most of the others combined and then goes on to say how she wouldn't want to be a vampire because she's a Christian and she's unsure about her soul if she gets turned.  Preachy much? And yes, Sookie does say throughout the series how she's a Christian etc, but that hasn't ever stopped her from killing and doing stuff like that.  What really annoys me about this is it is such a small part of the book and yet it's one of the things I remember the most, and not in a good way.<br /><br />I'm glad I read this series, it really was a great escape from things.  But, let's face it, it was a fluff series with a lot of plot holes that ended on a slightly sour note.  I really loved the first half of the series but the last couple of books have left quite a bit to be desired.  I would say I'm surprised by Harris's treatment of her fans, but I'm not.  I felt scammed back when I suddenly discovered I had missed a short story and had to pay almost as much for it as a regular book (which I didn't, I have yet to read any of the short stories).  I wish I didn't feel so jaded about authors, but between Harris and Martin, I wish that authors would forget about HBO, write their stories, and then do whatever they want with them.  I'm not necessarily saying that True Blood ruined this series (I love TB, but view it as a totally different animal), but I think Harris's shot to stardom kind of ruined her on Sookie.  Who knows.  Overall though, I am sad to see the series end and am looking forward to the new season of True Blood.
B004I8WD6E|4.0|Very good for the money.  Shameful how much AT&T wants for theirs.  My only complaint wouldn't be relevant to most people: I need to attach a wide angle lens to make videos occasionally, and this baby is HARD to remove!  That would be a good thing otherwise.Screen protector is as hard to align as any I've seen, but I like the case itself & would buy it again for the protection it provides.

1401235425|4.0|I've always been a fan of superheroes, especially those of DC. However, i had never picked up a comic book other than The Flash a couple of months ago. Main reason i picked this one up was because of the art. If it can grab my attention to actually sit down and read it, i believe the artist has done a good job. I would recommend this to anyone who is new to comics.
B006Q1SQCQ|5.0|I saw Harry Lorayne and Jerry Lucas on the Johnny Carson show and they memorized the entire audience's names and addresses and could name them back to Johnny given a short fragment of the name or address.  I was in high school at the time and I thought this book would be handy for school.  It took me a some time practicing to use all the techniques in the book, but after I understood it and used it in all my classes, I was pretty good at memorizing anything from history to fluid dynamic equations.  Once I memorized a text book or some equations, I found that for quizzes, midterms and finals, all I had to do was a quick review of the silly associations to strengthen the associations and then I was good to go.  The up front investment of using this memory system was well worth it, because the studying for the downstream tests was fast.  My test scores were usually the highest in any class and I graduated in the top 1% of high school, college and graduate school.  I would say this book's technique made it easier for me to achieve this.<br /><br />Forty years later, schools still do not teach memory techniques, which amazes me.  I bought this book to share with my ten year old grandson, with the logic being similar to learning a foreign language as a child: the younger you learn this technique, the easier it is for you as an adult.  I totally recommend this book for not only school, but everyday life.
B00CL68BK2|5.0|A truly good film, story and dialog and makes you really care and think about these people after film is over.
B006M4F67A|4.0|No problems with this game.  Levels are challenging and fun to play.  I would recommed it.<br />Got it as a free download so that was even better.
B00B4Z5GDQ|5.0|The clips from the 70s and 80s are worth the price of admission alone.  The history of Buckingham Nicks and Fleetwood Mac first recording there is fantastic.  Anyone interested in music, either form the performance or production side, should make this required viewing.
B006M4F67A|5.0|I enjoy the game very much.  It has many variations and all fun to do.  I would recomend it to any one.
B003CN4R74|4.0|On first listen I thought about half of the album was strong with instant grab you hooks.  Now after repeated listens I think this is a stellar album.  The writing is solid, and Amy Lee's vocals are just outstanding.  I think this is stylistically the logical progression from the Open Door sound.  It's very polished, but not overly so, and the production is very good.
B004PZ4HC8|5.0|bought this for my wife for mothers day. she's taking her time reading it but loves it so far.  going to buy another copy for my Buddy's birthday.
B005FISBTO|5.0|Enjoy this very much.  BIG fan of the show since the beginning and looking forward to the last season.  I have purchased each season on Amazon and am waiting for Season 7 to arrive.............and lastly Season 8.  I would recommend this DVD series to anyone.<br /><br />Smooth transaction.
B000VMFDW2|5.0|My father was a WW2 vet. and has since past.  He never really discussed the war in any detail.  This helps me to better understand what it was like.
1451627297|5.0|Loved it - what a great concept.  What a great mind!  I read it once and now it will be my Summer read<br /><br />Smooth transaction!
B0010SEMP0|5.0|Book 2 down and I'm hooked! Can't wait to read the rest of the series! None stop excitement, passion, and a new spin on vamps. Thanks for the reading enjoyment Jeaniene Frost!
B009YN2M7S|5.0|Read it in two days and I never wanted to put the book down! I am glad I bought this book! Enjoy
B001NLKT60|5.0|The author is a master of suspense. I thoroughly enjoyed this book and have recommended it to many of my friends.
0061950726|4.0|This is an artfully written, compelling story that contrasts two women generations apart in age.  It maintains the delicate balance of both histories, and brings the stories together for a very satisfying conclusion.
B009NY43NY|5.0|All the Sookie Stackhouse books leave you wanting more of the saga. After waiting for months for Dead Ever After's release, it was definitely worth the wait.
140131046X|5.0|Mitch Albom gets a surprise.  His rabbi, who has been Mitchs' mentor and teacher, asks his former student to write his eulogy.  Mitch knows this man from babyhood.  His parents joined Albert Lewis congragation.  Mitch has been away from temple for many years.  His wife is Christian.  Mitch lets readers know the history of his rabbis' life and that of his family, plus the life of another man of God, a black man from a poor family who has led a life of crime.  Then one night, when afraid he will be killed by his enemies, he promises Jesus if he is allowed to live he will dedicate his life to God.  He keeps his promise.<br /><br />Mitch has always looked up to the Reb, when he was a child he was in awe of this man.  Until he goes to his home, Mitch has never seen Albert Lewis dressed informally.  The Rabbi always wore suits and robes.  But Mitch has never been to the Rabbis' home until now.  The Reb meets him in Bermuda shorts, sandals with socks, a short sleeve shirt.  The rabbi began his congregation with a small family group which grows to over a thousand families. But now the Rabbi is old, his children are grown.<br /><br />The book goes back and forth, one chapter on one of Gods' men the next on the other.  Both men had lost a child, the Rabbis' four year old twin daughter became sick.  Hours later she was dead.  Henrys' first child, a son, was born premature, too premature to live.  Both men have loving wives; the Rabbi and his wife, Sarah, have been married over sixty years.  Henrys' wife, Annette, stayed with him during his life of crime, when he spent too much time in prisons.  The two met as teenagers.<br /><br />Mitch met Henry Covington in Detroit, a predominently black city.  Henry is pastor in a beautiful, old, decaying church that had once belonged to a prosperous congregation.  No longer.  This pastor is a true man of God.  He loves everyone.  He was introduced to Christianity as a young boy but did not live up to it until he promised God if He let himlive he would belong to Him.  Henry Covington is a friend to all, helping people believe they are worthwhile, seeking after strangers, being there for so many.  Mitch became interested in this man when he was writing for his newspaper and admires him as he does his rabbi.<br /><br />This book is uplifting, a worthwhile read even for those who are not religious.  It gives the reader a glimpse on the lives of these two men.  Mitch Albom is a journalist and has written several other books.
B004I8WD7S|4.0|I received my new IPhone case yesterday - exactly what I wanted, basic and easy.  The screen protector install was a little tricky as I wasn't sure how to get all of the air bubbles out.  The directions were very basic as well.  Nice case for an awesome price!
B000P6PVLC|1.0|I suggest do not watch this even if its free. It is very boring. I actually had to fast foward when the little kids were crying in the car because i was so annoyed.
B0089LOG02|3.0|I'd hoped for a more in depth story. What about her family, the people she met along the way?  Seemed like vignettes strung together -  I would have preferred a more cohesive story. Still enjoyed it - just didn't love it and I thought I would
B009SH5JS4|5.0|I like this funny comedy because it is excellent to have a good time with family. The actors are great. Ilike very much Meg Rayan.
B00B7PIRIE|1.0|Received all 3 DVD's however, some of the story were cut off and missing, now I wonder if DVD are counterfeited. The seoson 3 ending story have lot's of missing when I compare DVD with my friend. Very dissapointed with this purchased, would like to send back and get money back.
B004XUMPFQ|5.0|This is a wonderful show. I don't know why they took this off the air. It's one of my favorite shows, ever! The movie Serenity is also great.
B000NGTJTY|4.0|A guy movie with lots of action with an outstanding cast. Wouldn't recommend for the kiddies though because of the violence and language.
B007ZGO7EM|5.0|Easy to use and works great.I love how you can see every equation you entered by just a touch.highly recommend.
B00992CF6W|4.0|I really like this game, it's addicting and presents you with endless possibilities for what to build. I was bummed out though when I couldn't get the online multiplayer to work. I don't know if it's something I did or if it's the game. If anyone knows if I'm doing something wrong email me at reallycoolshow@gmail.com
B00915G6R6|5.0|I was swept up by this show's storytelling from the outset, and I too, like many of you reviewers, am compelled by its thought provoking season four finale to wonder just where do Alicia's allegiances truly lie.  \\"The Good Wife\\" has to be the cream of the tv drama crop.  I will definitely be placing an order for the Season Four dvd so I can re-live every intriguing moment right up to the Season Five premiere.
B008VBYN80|3.0|It's a good and a pretty fun game. But I gotta say the whole energy thing gets old and blows kinda hard
B007TNQ7EY|4.0|Reminds me of grand theft auto ... does anyone know any good games you can buy that are fun to play and not throw away in a day ?
B008AK8FHM|4.0|I enjoyed this read and would recommend it to others but with a warning. I would let the readers know that once you reach the halfway point in the book that the rest of the book is very repetitive. The author goes into so much detail about his experience in heaven but it is the same stuff he keeps going on about. I would suggest skipping to the last two chapters once you're half done and you wouldn't miss any great details.
B00005RIKI|1.0|A great album; just not the copy I was sent.<br /><br />After playing it about 10 times, it started sticking in one place and making an ugly sound.  Other CD's play perfectly in this player.
B007TNQ7EY|5.0|This is a really good game one of the best games I have ever played if you like grand theft auto then you will love this game
B00AEFXUL2|5.0|Wayne and Mitchum make a great pair of Law men. Similar to Rio Bravo in story but a great movie regardless.
B007SYWFRM|5.0|This game is addictive and my grandson and I love it, although I have pretty much taken over the game from my grandson.
B005S9ELVC|5.0|Movie was great........Not happy with quality of DVD........It was made in Mexico......screen was cut off......................................................................................................................................didn't know that....blab bala blab  blab
B007SYWFRM|4.0|My son and I both love this game.  It's a little irritating that I can't play with my friends, but they say they are working on that.  It would be nice if there were more ways to earn acorns too. . .without actually buying them with real moola.  Overall, it's a darn fun game.
B000SEI230|2.0|This book was my least favorite Nicholas Sparks book. It seemed like the book was written to make you cry.
B007FIY3VW|2.0|The app can only view files.Whenever I tried to edit an excel Sheet,App simply shut down.Why name it \\"Premium\\"if its just like a free app.
1451695195|2.0|Never expecting a \\"proof of heaven,\\" I was not troubled by the title.  But I had hoped for greater detail and insight in the retelling of Dr. Alexander's  personal experience.  He may be sincere and he may have found both his medical and his mystical experiences compelling.  But I did not find the retelling of them to be anything other than mildly interesting.<br /><br />To better understand the medical plight I would have found a review the medical records and other pertinent scientific literature to be more intellectually satisfying,<br /><br />To better consider the spiritual insights, I prefer to read the thoughts of people, be they religious or mystical in a more \\"secular\\" mode,  who echo Dr. Alexander's conclusions but who arrive at them from a more consistent personal discipline or who can provide a more reasoned understanding of a singular transformative experience.<br /><br />I am glad that Dr. Alexander and his family and friends endured and prevailed through a difficult ordeal.  And, I am glad he found strength and meaning in that experience.  Perhaps others will as well.  I am not one of them.
B008P1EWIM|5.0|I have it piled up on my desk as a night light when I go to bed pulse I also have a  a display screen when I am not using it
0199573204|5.0|A permanent part of my library, I often give this as a gift for it can be useful to a wide variety of people in many circumstances.<br /><br />At different times it has offered me:<br /><br />1) insights about the experience of being human<br /><br />2) suggestions and encouragement to help me more effectively be the person I prefer to be<br /><br />3) comfort in times of adversity<br /><br />4) delight at noting the commonalities between our society and an ancient one<br /><br />5) a kindled intellectual curiosity about philosophy and history<br /><br />6) a gentle reminder that railing about unfairness is unnecessary and that acceptance of unfavorable circumstances does not mean inaction.<br /><br />Basically, the Meditations serve to remind me of the useful things I have learned from experience and of what I value remembering.
B00BTYP6QE|5.0|This is the best app ever. Always listen to reviews because one time I thought that craft zombieland looked awesome but it was just a presentation. And there was no actual game just a presentation for $2 retarded
B005K17RU0|4.0|I use it frequently checking my home area as well as places where I will travel to.  It seems like there is a lot of extraneous stuff, but the touch interface is intuitive and it's easy enough to scroll past the stuff I don't need (like the video reports).
B000AJIAOO|4.0|you know at least this one is better than the Mexican edition...I hope I can buy everything here... Thank You it was awonderful experience...
B0094OLJD0|5.0|I love the richness of the musical score.  The rhythm and harmony are intriguing.  The use of brass and horns gives this album a unique sound.  The lyrics are off-the-wall; I'm not sure I understand them, but I like that way.
B0095P31L6|5.0|The first time I watched the movie I didn't really like it. However, since my son wants to watch it all the time I have grown to love the movie! It's absolutely HYSTERICAL and the attention to detail is PHENOMENAL! There are a few weird scenes that are a bit \\"unsettling\\" to say the least, but overall, I enjoy it more every time I watch it :o)
B005IQZB14|5.0|I am really enjoying this book.  She is brutally honest about herself and her journey.  The book is well written and the reader does not want it to end.  I can't wait to finish it.
0451418441|2.0|Years ago, like many others, I read and thoroughly enjoyed Pillars of the Earth. More recently, I had the opportunity to watch the Pillars of the Earth 2010 made-for-television mini series, which I also really liked. Therefore, it was a natural progression to read the sequel, World Without End.<br /><br />Perhaps I should have just stopped after the mini series. I did not like this book at all and had trouble forcing myself to read it. Follett is an outstanding writer, and I have read some of his other work in the past. This book was written in a style that may not even stimulate my fifth grader. The word choice and sentence structure were distractingly simple and resulted in a story that was told superficially, with little nuance or subtlety. The characters were not interesting or engaging, for the most part. The storyline was fairly predictable.<br /><br />I know that I sound like a literary snob, and nothing is further from the truth. There was little that I found to hold my interest, hence the title of my review.
B0063IH60K|5.0|This is an awesome game...as it always has been.  I love knocking off a couple of games before bed.  It helps me unwind.
B008Y7N7JW|4.0|Well-acted by Lawrence and other key roles, and a good story. Many plot points test credulity and many characters are too stereotypically one-dimensional.
B006M4F67A|5.0|Easy to see and separate tile designs helps to make this a very pleasant and enjoyable game to play. It also has 20 or 80 plus tile layout board designs to select from. You can start with the \\"Classic\\" layout or pick one of the many  traditional or more imaginative layouts. There's plenty here to keep you entertained or challenged if you prefer that. It even gives you hints tHat you can use or ignore if you decide too. There's so much to enjoy!
1878424114|5.0|I love Deepak Chopra and his writings, He writes with such a simplicity that it makes it easy to apply his wisdom to your daily life. In fact, this book, gives specific practices you can do. They might be simple to do, but don't underestimate the impact they have.
034580404X|4.0|Brought the books for a friends birthday.  Decided to read them 1st.  Couple time got tired of the same old thing, in a few chapters
B00AAQWMB4|4.0|Full instructions for playing are in the help menu--including pictures. The basic idea is that you're trying to get as many of your pieces on the board as possible. The catch is, your pieces can only touch on the diagonal and there are three other players competing for board space. The strategy takes a little while to get used to, but I did beat the ai on my fourth try. I love that this app has no extraneous permissions and is licensed on the gpl. My only wish is that the lowest difficulty level were a little easier. I like a challenge, but it would be nice to have an easy level to get used to the strategy and game dynamics.
B009FZHYKU|5.0|Im addicted! Always sitting on the edge of my seat and not predictable...always a twist that surprises you!  I recommend it strongly!
B000IDGBWU|5.0|Great story, great acting, and great music!  It was a great depiction of some of the issues of the time, particularly in those family camp settings... Patrick Swayzee was wonderful!
B006M4F67A|2.0|The game was OK but a little boring.  I think it is easier playing on a larger screen.<br />It passes the time.
B0055MBQOM|5.0|Bought the Xrite ColorMunki as we were finding the images we'd spend hours &#34;perfecting&#34; in Lightroom and Photoshop never turned out as we imagined/created after receiving the professional prints.  After trying to figure out why we were getting disappointing print results, we stumbled on a video recommending monitor calibration as a solution.  Everything was simple to install, following the setup wizard - and what a difference it made!<br /><br />At first, it seemed like our monitor was too dark (compared to factory settings), but it really did match better to our printed photographs.  So we took some of our previous disappointing prints and re-corrected them in Photoshop with the newly calibrated monitor...The prints now came back as we expected/imagined them!<br /><br />Nice that we can install and calibrate multiple computer monitors (i.e. MacBook Pro & iMac) with Xrite - although you need the hardware connected by usb in order to calibrate as room/light conditions change.  We simply keep the ColorMunki hardware connected to the iMac we do most of our work on, and move it to the MacBook every couple of weeks to recalibrate there.<br /><br />Can't say enough about how much of a difference the ColorMunki has made to our photo editing and giving us the confidence that our prints will come out as we imagined them from our photo editing software on-screen.
B00C7TAF3Y|5.0|addicting, fun, and really interesting. and if you do get really stuck, theres a walkthrough online. but this app is perfect. i hope theres a second one soon.
B005D9MUWY|5.0|Time is too important to waste it in the backspace key<br />Use SwiftKey. Forget about the backspace. Backspace keys are for suckers. I believe that I have written 20 words now.
034580404X|5.0|I loved these books; allot more than I thought.  I really thought this would be just about a Dom/Submissive relationship; but 50 Shades goes into so much more than that. It's an exciting story of a young woman and a man; whose broken past has turned him into someone who feels the only type of relationship it to be a Dom/Submissive. He feels a connection in Anastasia but the tables turn when it's more for both. And it changes Christian. This Dom/Sub relationship turns more into love; for both characters.<br /><br />I really loved the 2nd novel; 50 Shades Darker. And how the loss of Anastasia really turns Christian into another person and that what is lacking in him; she gives but still maintains a relationship that is still loving and exciting. And it shows two individuals who are really in love with each other. A love that is more than sex ; a realtionship of love, trust and intimacy.<br /><br />Then the last book is 50 Shades Freed; really shows a side of how Ana and Christian really strive to maintain that love and how he's dark side will affect their future and (me as a reader) just really roots for these two to stay together. She is confronted with his past and dark side; and her curiosity always seem to get the better; and it takes a toll on both her and Christians future.<br />Another great aspect is how Ana turns from a naive girl to a woman who craves this man so much that she is willing to put down any boundaries and still maintain the intimacy but wants the exciting dark side of Christian also. And I love how the \\"love story\\" part is not corny and still is romantic and erotic.<br /><br />I definitely recommend these books. I hope EL James come up with some more great love/erotic books in the future.
B00884GR0W|4.0|Its hard but my 7yr old still likes it. he gave it a 4 star because its too hard and doesn't make sense in some areas but for the most part its good.
B00A3VLJCE|2.0|This app is a far cry from the program of the same name. While my fire does have a camera, I do actually have a camera to take pictures with and I don't seem to be able to load it in the cloud and work with it on my fire.
B00CEIGYAG|5.0|What can I say? I just love this song and I think is great, another great song by Daft Punk.

0525478817|5.0|So....I finished The Fault in Our Stars, and even though I had already predicted the ending(I have a bad habit of that....) it still was a shock. It's one of those endings that's terrible on the narrator that makes you want to smack the author for doing it. But....it's real. Truth is, life isn't full of happy endings. Life sucks, people get sick, and people die. And John Green portrayed this fact perfectly in The Fault in Our Stars.<br /><br />I've heard people complain that it's unrealistic. I seriously can't understand HOW it's unrealistic. I personally found it to be very honest and real. It's probably one of the most honest books I've read in a LONG time. Moving on to another complaint I've heard. 'Guys shouldn't write from a girl's Point of View.'. I'll admit, I was a bit worried when I found out that the book was from Hazel's point of veiw, and not third person. The only time I've ever read a book that was written by a guy, in a girl's POV, it was straight out bad. John Green has proven that you CAN successfully write in the POV of the opposite gender.<br /><br />Yes, this is a sad book, but there's alot of comedy in there too. I laughed for 10 solid minutes towards the end of the book. My chest hurt, my eyes were watering, and I couldn't breathe all because of on little page. Even thinking about it now gets me laughing.<br /><br />All in all, I suggest this to anyone who likes to read. It's honest, heartfelt, and true to the core. Maybe it doesn't have wizards from a foreign land, or vampires that sparkle, but it's an amazing book that deserves a chance to be loved by someone.
B003FL4O9E|4.0|TNMT will never get old for kids... They got attitude and martial techniques to match!!  Parents.. watch out for that vase!!!
B007N85POS|5.0|I especially like AB Rio because of all the special and secret fruits I must find in the game.  It keeps my attention.  Recommend to all who like Angry Birds.
B00COGY2P2|4.0|First off..DONT EXPECT MISSION IMPOSSIBLE!! .  Tom Cruise is looking his age but he can still come up big in action movies!  This is one of those he plays down more to symbolize the efficiency of the character actions without so much violence and destruction...but of course you are going to get enough to satisfy and quench your thirst for action!
B0071XO8RA|3.0|Good story. Kept me up late. Starts a bit slow while developing but quickly picks up with that one transmission... It's fun when the plot takes a sharp, unexpected turn in one sentence. The character development is a bit weak -- the author was anxious to get on with the story which is understandable because it's a good one. If you like post-apocalyptic type themes, you would enjoy this. I'm reading &#34;Shift&#34; (the prequel/sequel) now.
B00BSBU4EC|5.0|Anything to do with the holidays are a treat for us!  No matter what time of the year, this movie is a strong contender as one of those animated movies you can see over and over again!  This is the perfect movie to introduce some of the not-so-well known characters like Jack Frost into the lives of children...even the adults in the family enjoyed this great story.  I am always fascinated how writers can come up with new storylines for timeless characters and still make them wonderful to see and hear!  Don't miss this one - its not just another cartoon!!
B006M4F67A|4.0|There are plenty of puzzle options to choose from.  Unfortunately, it's crashed on me once already.  If you like Mahjong, it's probably worth it.
B00BI73CVI|5.0|For those not spoiled by other adaptations or boasting professional singers and actors this is a WONDERFUL WONDERFUL movie. If ever I find I like the stage play or any other performance better it still does not discredit these men/women who put on a genuinely great show. I thoroughly enjoyed watching this.
B009MYARIK|3.0|Sometimes hard to read due to many many spelling errors, Bought the book and the errors were corrected there. Only online is the edition plagued with errors.
0307476073|5.0|This a a must read for anyone who has that inner hunger to challenge themself and &#34;just hasn't done it.&#34; Cheryl Strayed writes as if you are right there next to her.

B00AKL1XPU|5.0|Very excellent:<br />I like it very educational for kids and fun for kids as well. I'm there are animals and<br />dinosaurs I never even heard of before.There are mythical creatures and newly added fresh water and sea water animals. I highly recommend this game!

B004MC8CA2|5.0|I love the reading variety of reading plans, the bible references and different versions of the bible that you can download for free.  the only thing I don't like is not being able to access the plans without wifi so I often fall behind but do enjoy catching up.  please consider making selected plans available offline
B00BWBHIUG|2.0|There's a limited number of quests. Once you finish them all , the only way to level is to endlessly harvest your plants. The game slows way down and becomes tedious. I lost interest when I hit level 17 because there's just nothing left to do.

0143034901|5.0|This is one of my favorite books of all time. I first read it as a teenager after falling in love with the city of Barcelona. I wanted to get my hands on anything about Barcelona and was so lucky to have stumbled upon this gem. Such intrigue yet such humanism in Ruiz Zafon's writing.

0062235893|1.0|I thought I was buying the whole book in cloth format, as I had purchased one like that before.  This cloth edition has only a few of the pages represented.  Also, the coloring is waaaaay off.  The \\"red balloon\\" is bright orange.  It would confuse the heck out of a child learning colors.

0307200477|5.0|My children grew up with the original &#34;Pat the Bunny&#34; and loved it, so I bought this one for my grandson.  It is so much bigger and with more interactive pages than the old one that I love it even more.  My children's books were lost in a house fire years ago so I am having to start over, replacing favorites for my first grandson.  This is the first book I have found that I actually like better than the original.
0920668372|5.0|It's a wonderful story of the start of life with a Mother singing to her new son and the love through good times and bad and the song implies.  And no matter how old the Son gets, the Mother sings the song, I'll Love You Forever.  The most touching part for me is when the Son sings the song to the Mother as she dies, and he comes home and picks up his child and sings the wonderful touching song.  I went through a quarter box of Kleenex crying,(My Mother has cancer.)  It's a beautiful story.
B0051GOB26|4.0|Contain the movie in a good quality. I don't know if the \\"book\\" is worthy, and there's only a couple of extras but I don't sure if exist any more. For the price I can't complain, but don't expect more that I said
B005FMZX9Q|5.0|I saw this watch last weekend on a friend, and couldn't believe when Amazon had such a great price.  It is large, but it fits just right with the leather band.  It really is noticed, and all that see it want it.  I've ordered 2 more Invicta watches today, both are Reserve models.  If those have the same quality as this one, I'll be very happy.<br /><br />One item to note, the dials are white & hard to see if you use reading glasses.  It is easy to see at night, but daytime is difficult.<br /><br />It is a great evening dress watch, simple, but commanding, it makes a statement w/o really trying.  You don't need to point it out, everyone will notice & comment.
B0000046ZJ|5.0|This is one of my 'desert island' albums. A treasure that I have ripped to my MP3-enabled phone so I am never far from it.  The sheer beauty of Getz' tenor, and the amazing backing from Peterson on piano, Herb Ellis on guitar and Ray Brown on bass makes this album special.<br /><br />Since this page has sound samples I am going to let those tell you about the album. It would be pretentious of me to try to describe the album with words when a quick sample of each track will convey much more information.<br /><br />One reason that I personally love this album is it's a reminder to me that Getz was an extraordinary tenor saxophonist in a number of jazz sub genres. I tend to overlook that and focus on his later Brazilian work, but in truth he was one of the true greats who has a place in the same pantheon as Lester Young, Coleman Hawkins and Ben Webster.<br /><br />Another reason I love this album is the trio backing Getz. I have always admired the early edition of that trio with Ellis in lieu of a drummer. Of course, Peterson on piano is always a treat, and the great Ray Brown on bass guarantees a rhythm section made in heaven.<br /><br />Finally, because this edition of the trio does not have a drummer the album makes it great for playing along to when I am practicing my own drum kit playing.<br /><br />The album itself was recorded in Los Angeles on October 10, 1957 and originally released by Verve the same year. The original had only tracks 1 through 7 - the remaining four tracks are from the same session and were included as bonus tracks on the reissue.

All of these things combine into a terrific resource.  This is worth the $1.69.  It is a fantastic opportunity as FAOTD.

B00A8MGLAI|1.0|This movie made absolutely no sense whatsoever...there was no storyline...the makeup effects in the future Seoul section had to have insulted the entire asian community...I could not understand half of the dialog at all...boatloads and boatloads of mumbling, especially in the future module of the movie (post SonMi)...I had absolutley no clue what the thread was supposed to be, what was happening in each sequence, or what was supposed to be linking them.  There was never any true explanation of the comet birthmark.  I have to say this was the worst, most confusing movie I have seen in years.

B0000E1ALR|5.0|Is it possible that anyone breathing today hasn't already made up his or her mind about Springsteen?  If there is such a soul, this collection, which stretches from Bruce's first album up through about 2003, would be a good introduction, but really, as other reviewers have noted, one always wonders why song X or song Y wasn't included.  Given that there's nothing here that doesn't belong, it's a testimony to the strength of his writing over 30+ years that we still wish that some other things had been included.  Really, though, you need to buy the individual albums, because Springsteen clearly plans his albums carefully, and the individual songs make part of a larger whole.  That larger whole has to do with overall mood -- so \\"The Ghost of Tom Joad\\" album is one thing and the \\"Born to Run\\" album or \\"Tunnel of Love\\" quite another.  Still, it's good to get some sense of the overall arc, and it raises the question: \\"Has anyone else been so consistently productive of quality material over 40 years?\\"  Dylan, Simon, Petty -- they've all been busy, and God knows they're great, but for really good stuff over a very long time, it's hard to beat Bruce.  And the energy he brings to his concerts is still amazing.  This collection also enables one to appreciate the many things that Bruce can do expressively with his voice -- he can rock with a snarl or a smile, he can whisper, and he can carry a ballad.  It's easy to forget, because he can rock so hard, how beautiful the basic quality of his voice is.

B0001MLMKY|5.0|After many battery changes, I had to retire my 80’s Swatch because the original band finally broke. While looking on here for a band, I found this. After 25 years, I think I got my money’s worth out of the last one. While it’s the same basic round black style, this one adds day/date and glow-in-the-dark hands. Should be Retro (which I’m fine with) but this design might be timeless. There is something about a basic analog watch (that’s easy to read and dependable) that I love. I think good for every-day and business-casual.

But, it would have been a lot better if you didn't have to unlock the diseases by beating the game with previous diseases it gets annoying after a while especially considering that there are 7 diseases.

B002WV5A9G|5.0|Having grown up with the original Star Trek TV series, having a chance to see the characters in new form and in their earlier days has brought the magic back to life! The action and graphics are so much better now, of course, but the idea of warp speed space travel and possibility of varied life forms in the universe always made Star Trek an adventure to love. This movie works for all ages in my book!

B003IEJZUG|5.0|I did not want this great story to end! The only regret I have about this book is that I waited so long to pick it up and read it. I would never have imagined the vivid story that would take me on this incredible journey of 460 pages. I did not want to watch the movie or have anyone who had read the book before me, tell me of its contents because I wanted to read it without bias. I could not put this book down, it had me from page one. The illustrations were very nice and added a great touch to my imagination already at work. This book was truly a great read and will make you feel all of the human emotions that a good book should do.

B009NY43NY|2.0|I won't go into the plot here. Mostly because its ridiculous. It's contrived mostly to provide opportunity to bring back many characters. Amelia, Bob, Barry, Quinn....it was nice to see them. However, I'd have liked to see others. Like Bubba (unless I forgot he perished). Hunter (mentioned) and others. However I could have done with all this if some of the people I loved had been given more than small cameos. Bill. Pam. Eric. In the end it was pretty obvious where it was going to end up. I may be forced to read fan fiction just to get satisfaction on the end to some characters. Also, in October there will be another book about what happened to all of the characters after the books ended. Why not keep writing them if you still want to tell their stories? Big fat fail.

1451695195|1.0|The title of the book Proof of Heaven by Eben Alexander is not designed to provide information regarding content of the book.  Rather the title Proof of Heaven is designed to prey upon the potential audience the author is seeking in order sell the book and I do not think I am overstating my opinion by stating his likely real calling is used car salesman.  (my apology to ucs; don't mean to be insulting.)<br /><br />I bought the book on a recommendation from a palliate care doctor in my role as Health Care Director to a family member.  Dying patients and their family and friends are no doubt some of those that this book targets as part of the author's potential audience (prey).<br /><br />Half way through I thought to myself as Inquiring Mind stated in her/his review (read too late of course) \\"is this a Narcissistic Personality Disorder?\\"  Possibly but most certainly \\"well let's see how we can sell this book?\\"  \\"Ahh ha, let's call it Proof of Heaven. That'l sell.\\"<br /><br />In Proof of Heaven the author stated that he took his son's advise and wrote down all of his recollections of his NDE or experiences in Heaven prior to reading any of the literature on the subject in order not to be influenced by anything he might read on NDE.  The author claims to have done exactly this.  However, prior to my having come to that part of the book where the author makes that statement I kept wondering why the word \\"Gateway\\" he was using as his abbreviation for Gates of Heaven sounded like it came straight out of Robert Monroe's Gateway Hemi-Sync workshops at the Monroe Institute in Faber, Virginia.<br /><br />The NDE the author is referring to occurred in November, 2008.  He went through the Gateway Voyager program at the Monroe Institute in 2011.  His book Proof of Heaven was published in 2012.  NO, NONE, ZIP, NADA, ZERO, to my knowledge, of those people associated with the Monroe Institute has endorsed this book. Nor is the publisher of many of the authors who are associated withthe Monroe Institute, Hampton Roads, the publisher of Proof of Heaven. (See page 175 paperback edition where one entire page of a three page Acknowledgements section is devoted to the praise of various persons associated with the Gateway Hemi-Cync and the Monroe Institute).  Use of the word Gateway seems to suggest that most if not all the author's recollections were derived, interpreted, likely imagined after his coma and therefore the critical question of experience while in a coma are entirely irrelevant.<br /><br />The malpractice suits against Dr. Alexander are relevant here not so much for having performed surgery at the wrong sites on, I think, 3 different occasions but rather that he tried to cover up and hide what he had done which brought the charge of ethics into the malpractice suits.  It is one thing to make mistakes (geez 3 times) but to lie to the patients and change records is criminal or should be.  Clearly, Dr. Alexander had to find another career!<br /><br />If everything that was NOT descriptive of \\"heaven\\" or \\"there\\" were eliminated from the book AND ALL repetition used to describe \\"heaven\\"  were eliminated from the book there would be no more than a couple of paragraphs left in the whole book.<br /><br />More important than anything else is the author's claim that he was in communication with GOD.  Really!  Gee I think someone we all know who had been at the helm of government in 2001 also claimed having communicated with GOD.  And then invaded Iraq because of  WMD!<br /><br />Note also that the \\"inky-black core\\"  is in stark contrast to the extensive literature on LIGHT!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!  The later stated \\"inky darkness that was also full to brimming with light\\" is not convincing.<br /><br />There is no proof of heaven here and I think Raymond A. Moody ought to be more careful on what books he has lent his good name to on the cover.<br /><br />Bravo to reviewer Inquiring Mind for the research on this author's sordid record as an MD.<br /><br /> chezlouise

B0018O4YSQ|1.0|I really enjoyed Roger's professional career. So when I read his review of the Matrix he mentioned this movie and raved about it. So I bought the movie, it was delivered less than 12 hours later by Amazon. I watched it and through the dark images, vague plot lines and meaningless ending I feel he must have seen a different movie than what I watched. The Matrix or for that matter the 5th Element are by far more beautiful to watch with amazing messages for reflection. Don't' buy, rent if curious about this movie and save your money.
9889979942|5.0|This is a book that, from the outset, looks unassuming and tidy, but as soon as you open the pages, it's like taking a long, beautiful walk through China. Tom Carter's photography is so evocative and personal that I immediately felt transported back to China, a place I've known for many years but never like this.<br /><br />The structure of the book, which leads you through various regions of China via brief captions and a range of photographs--of people, architecture, scenery, etc.--is the perfect way through which to comprehend China visually. There is such a striking range of personal portraits, evidence of a photographer who clearly understands that China is not 'one thing' but is, as the title suggests, a colorful mosaic of peoples gathered in one ever-changing land.

B0018QCXGY|5.0|I'm suprised this movie only got 3 stars overall.  Really great idea for a \\"found footage\\" type film.  Special effects are great and pretty realistic. Pays homage to Godzilla and other Kaiju films.  I especially like the Bluray version, the special features are great, especially the U.S. Department of Defense \\"analysis video\\" of the movie.  Looks pretty official even though it's fiction.  I think this might possibly be the most expensive \\"found footage\\" film out there at the moment.  Great to add to your sci-fi/horror collection.

193700788X|3.0|I am disheartened to see all the hate out there in the media/social networking for not just \\"Dead Ever After\\" but in some instances this amazing author as well.  You know the great thing about books is that good ones just suck you right into the world and make you feel so darn attached and investing in the characters.  Charlaine Harris did this for readers all over the world. She created this world where vampires can walk right into a little bar and order synthetic blood right sitting right next to the hillbilly ordering a beer.  Waitresses can read your mind and know exactly how much you'd like to throw that soda at the trashy vixen flirting with your man.  In a lot of ways Charlaine Harris introduced me to the world of paranormal fantasy novels.  It was the early 2000's...I was reading Nicholas Sparks and Erica Spindler.  I was getting burnt out on the same old novels.  One day at the bookstore, a pretty cover caught my eye because it was all glittery and sparkly.  It was about vampires? Really?  I bought the first two right there and I believe that was all that was currently out. I fell in love hard with the series and I immediately researched and bought anything else that sounded like the Southern Vampire series.  So yes, this series is personal to me, much like it is personal to many of the readers out there who feel so betrayed.  So believe me I understand.<br /><br />I haven't been obsessed with Sookie for several books now. They didn't hold my attention like they did in the past and I felt like the books seemed to come together at the end far too easily.  Along the time that Eric had amnesia I was pretty much on Team Eric all the way.  But as the books progressed I found that I didn't care for him quite as much as I used to and I knew all along that Sookie would not likely end up with any vampire.  Harris had been clear from day one to say that Sookie would never be turned.  She also said early on in the series that we had already met Sookie's happily ever after and that she already knew how the series would conclude.  So when we met Quinn, I knew he wouldn't be the one for her since Harris had already made those statements prior to his introduction.  By process of elimination, I have known for years who Sookie would end up with.  It was no shocker to me and I have loved that character all along.  Sure, some readers have held out and hoped that somehow their choice would end up with Sookie at the end.  Maybe Harris would change her plan since fans loved Eric so much or maybe she would be influenced by the course of the HBO show. (Although changing her artistic choice based on the show would have been a sellout if I had ever heard one).  But Charlaine stuck to her path that she charted at the very beginning and that was her choice.  We don't have to like it but it isn't our decision.  It would be like asking Margaret Mitchell to go ahead and let Rhett stay with Scarlet at the end of Gone with the Wind.  I'm sure that was never a popular ending either!<br /><br />I am not saying that \\"Dead Ever After\\" was a great book.  It was easily a three star novel for me.  I don't hate the ending of the book but I really felt cheated by how quickly it came together.  I wanted to feel their connection.  I can believe that Sookie would end up with this person, absolutely.  But this was a quick and unbelievable route to happily ever after.  I wanted more of them discovering this love that was so much more powerful than her love with any of the other guys...and it just fell flat.<br /><br />I do believe that the author was done with series and she did hang on too long. I just think so many new plot threads were created that then she had do write even more books just to wrap up everything she started in motion.  But those plots did get wrapped up.  Most of our characters ended up in a fairly happy place.  A big complaint overall from fans is where Eric ended up.  It is sad and I am not really sure where Harris was coming from with this choice either. Perhaps it had to be something drastic to get him away from Sookie.  I just wish there could have been more satisfaction driven from this piece of the puzzle.  Eric was far and away Harris's most dynamic creation.  Good guy, bad guy, whatever he was, he was special and his fate doesn't seem especially fitting for him.<br /><br />The final book was very readable and I did like the mysteries and the story about Arlene and Sookie's arrest for murder.  I liked seeing Tara's babies and seeing Jason happy.  I didn't like the fact that Bubba didn't make one final appearance although he was in the previous book.  I didn't like that additional vampire character brought in to watch Sookie.  It was a little late in the game for a new player to be introduced, especially one that should have been so important.<br /><br />Overall, I am just on the fence with this book.  It was certainly not the pile of garbage I would have feared by reading the reviews.  I know readers felt invested in Eric, like I said, he was special, but the fact that the author's direction has lead to such hate really bothers me.  The thing I want to remember about this series is how the world sucked me in and introduced me to the idea of paranormal stories.  This is a genre that I adore and I will always remember that Charlaine Harris and Sookie introduced me to it.hoice either. Perhaps it had to be something drastic to get him away from Sookie.

B00AQB2A3I|5.0|I have been a Steven Wilson fan since the earliest days of his musical journey. All the way back to the Voyage 34 days, I have thoroughly enjoyed each milestone in his prolific career. This album (yes, I still refer to masterpieces such as this as albums) is by far his crowning achievement.<br /><br />Furthermore, I refuse to sing (much like the raven) about how much it compares to some of the greatest work by others in recent history because I sincerely believe it stands on its own merits. Moreover, I beg you to listen to it in its entirety twice without interruption before casting judgment. This is because your mind is likely to wrap around its musical blueprint more thoroughly after your first listen.<br /><br />I also strongly suggest you catch this work live if you still can. I had the pleasure of doing so this past week here in Los Angeles and it placed an entirely fresh perspective on the overall concept. As a recovering preforming musician, witnessing these virtuous perform this live immediately made me want to pick up a guitar again and hit the stage to bask in the afterglow.<br /><br />Hat's off to Mr. Wilson, thank you for continuing to share your sonic voyage with us. I am sure we all look forward to where you'll venture to next...
030758836X|3.0|For being a top seller I don't get it. The book was somewhat predictable and hated the ending. A few good twists though that keeps you a bit interested.
B000YH6YG8|5.0|Norton's performance, as expected, is beyond comparison, and he is truly one of the finest actors of his generation. This narrative of redemption through the violent haunting of the past forces an older brother to see the ultimate results of his earlier actions--actions which demand the sacrifice of that which he loves. The teacher who cares about what happens to Norton's character is what finally makes the difference, and this is the takeaway: Only by caring for others can the world be changed for the better.<br />  This is recommended for all who love Norton's work, for school humanities classes, and for those seeking to better understand what it means to hate, and love, in America.
B003YL4LYI|5.0|A Dance with Dragons is another great book in the series.  I can't wait until the Book 6 is released.
B000MXPE7O|2.0|I have to start off by saying I love spy  movies. I'm not talking just James Bond movies, but movies as maudlin and depressing as director Martin Ritt's THE SPY WHO CAME IN FROM THE COLD. But if I thought THAT was a downer, this Robert DeNiro-directed historical spy epic goes to the top of the list of downright depressing. When your main character shows all the emotion of a dead mackerel, you know you're in trouble. I GET IT that that's the way the character was written, but if you're going to sit through 2 1/2 hours of this... Anyway, I appreciated the espionage tidbits in this film, but at the same time I realize this is a very Left-wing liberal look at the CIA. DeNiro seems to go out of his way to constantly hammer us with how ruthless the OSS and later, the CIA were, without anything favorable about the organizations. I think this does disservice to all the men and women, who remain nameless, gave their lives in the service of this country, like it or not. I can't heartily recommend this movie.
B007Z9QP3K|5.0|this movie shows the reality and the tragedy of the submarines in the WWII, without the need of major horror war scenes like other war movies.<br />The living in those &#34;cans&#34; with all the emotional problems is best to understand if German is your language.  The English subtitles do not translate correctly very often, missing some details.  But in general it's ok.
0312430000|5.0|I picked up this book as new from the library. I won it in a raffle and I wasn't really sure what to expect. I decided to read it anyway, out of curiosity. I was pleasantly surprised.<br /><br />The Checklist Manifesto is a VERY interesting book. The author, Atul Gawande, is a surgeon, who is asking the question \\"why do things go wrong, and how to we stop them?\\" You would think that in this world of technology, specialization, and years of preparation, basic errors in medicine, finance, architecture, and other fields would have been avoided. However, we are making more mistakes than ever, and mostly they're silly mistakes. Things that were EASILY over looked. Sometimes those mistakes can create lethal consequences, such as giving a patient the wrong medication during surgery, and other times everything ends up OKAY, but still, if there's a way to AVOID those silly mistakes, then why not take those steps?<br /><br />Dr. Gawande proposes the CHECKLIST - a simple tool, that can be used in many fields, to get things done right. He shows how the checklist helps airplane pilots both in routine and emergency situations. He shows how to develop and monitor the effectiveness of a checklist. And he shows how well it has worked in his own labs. He also talks about the resistance against using a checklist and tried to give an explanation for that.<br /><br />This book is written in simple English, is easy to read, and even includes some samples of checklists in the back. There is a lot of GREAT research in there, and history behind uses of checklists in many fields. It shows just how WELL they work, and after reading this book, I just can't argue. If I'll ever be in surgery, investing my money, or building something, I'll be using a checklist too!<br /><br />Actually, in my own real life, I created a checklist for my job, and I have to say, it's helped a LOT. It dramatically reduced the burden of \\"Remember to do this and that\\" and instead, I can focus on other things.<br /><br/>I recommend this book to everyone - from plumbers to surgeons. There is just no arguing against the power of the Checklist to get things done RIGHT the FIRST time!
B00433LYBY|5.0|This album is awesome. She is so versatile on her songs and I love listing to them all, would recommend.
B009PNQUXO|1.0|It's not that good of an app. It does not satisfy my satisfaction. I might recommend this app. Not that much though.
B006VFLIYK|5.0|Love the new character.  Will has character! I am a big fan of spy/government books.  This was definitely a good read with varied characters.
B0012Q732O|5.0|Although there are not any dinosaurs as I remember, there are plenty of sabretooths and the such to keep you fascinated by what life was like about 12,000 years ago. From what I studied in school, this movie is fairly to very accurate but much more fun to watch(or in my school's case, read!) with views of very ancient culture with them just starting to form governments, theocracies, and methods of worship. Tribal customs and the such. Highly entertaining and also surprisingly educating. If you like movies like Conan the Barbarian or Beastmaster, this is at least somewhat similar(without magic powers though). Prehistory fun with more mammals than dinosaurs distinguishes this from Jurassic Park. Very fun and interesting at the same time indeed!
B00CATSONE|4.0|I was interested so I kept reading. I enjoyed the whole thing and it covered all the important stuff.  If you want a nice summary of Nikola Tesla, this is it.
B00BMKDTNC|5.0|A thrilling and appropriate end to a roller coaster series....thank you, Robert and Brandon...for an amazing story and legacy like no other in this genre.

B00BWBHIUG|5.0|Pretty neat game for kids. The movie is one of our favorite Disney movies.  just cant beat the graphics too.
B008Y7N7JW|5.0|I really enjoyed this movie.  Kept me wondering what would happen next.  The characters were very good. So glad this was just a movie and not a true story.
B000FC13MM|5.0|I first read Sabriel as a tween and loved it, which launched me on to the rest of the series. These books became some of my favorites and ones that I re-read over and over again. Having continued to re-read them into adulthood, these books still stand up and offer up a wonderful and believable alternate universe and a great adventure story to boot.
B00B5JVXYC|5.0|challenging enough to be entertaining. easy enough to learn and follow. really easy to use and understand. great little game.
B00BMKDTNC|5.0|The Last Battle. Basically the whole book. And it is... amazing. Its been along road. Filled with friends and enemies. Love and hate. The Light and the Shadow. The Wheel of Time shall forever remain in my heart.
B005LAII08|5.0|I purchased this despite my 6 yr old son protesting that it was a &#34;girls&#34; movie. He loves watching it -especially her three little brothers and the mischief they create.  Good story with a moral to it - something that seems to be harder to find these days. Animation is wonderful and the story moves along at a good pace. My son even likes the archery in it after he got to try his hand at it in Cub Scouts!
B002CNOA6S|5.0|this was my first time watching this movie and I loved it. I found it hilarious as well on certain parts. Dustin did a great job playing that role.
B00COGZ8FU|5.0|I love all the action and drama in this movie.  Tom Cruise is a fantastic actor, very convincing.  Also loved the smart remarks and fight scenes.

B00B5HQKNI|4.0|This was a very dark Bond and well done. The stunts were amazing. Certainly violent but aren't all Bond movies? I think Daniel Craig is my second favorite Bond. My first choice for Bond will always be Sean Connery.
B0091REZMW|5.0|Ok neat zoom and pretty lady like her glasses hard to see something like necklaces fun for all my kids love it
B009LMTDL0|5.0|This book offers refreshingly honest personal insight both into why women hold themselves back and how society subtly and not so subtly encourages women to hold back. It's a wonderful and easy read that will empower you to sit at the table and consider yourself an equal member of your work environment.
B00CHSPB8Y|2.0|There wasn't enough of the basic game to really enjoy. To get into it you have to begin buying parts to continue.

B002ZCY7PU|5.0|Chuck is great entertainment for the entire family. Lots of laughs, just enough suspense with a few twists and turns to keep you haning on for more. I love watching the transformation of nerd Chuck to hot Chuck.
B00C1BU7V8|4.0|I really enjoyed this film even though we know the outcome. I think all the actors did a great job with their roles. Sally Field was wonderful.
0374203032|1.0|Sandel has always had a habit of not citing sources in his popular writing, but this case is the most egregious.  Pretty much every idea in What Money Can't Buy is a popularization of the work of Stanford professor Margaret Radin, e.g. in her book Contested Commodities.  I was shocked and appalled to discover that Sandel does not cite her work at all.  If a student in my class did this, i would give it an \\"F.\\"
B006M4F67A|3.0|Good but no way to change background color, tiles are metimes hard to see. Tile size is too small in the bigger designs.
B000UVT3OI|5.0|One of my favorite country artists, this 2 disc (plus DVD) set does not disappoint.  My faves are, Friends in Low Places, Two Pina Coladas, Thunder Rolls, and more.  I love jammin' out and singin' at the top of my lungs in my car on my commute home from work!!!
B0044DEAUA|2.0|it's sometimes hard to hear people speaking to me. They also think it's a little fuzzy. It also doesn't feel that sturdy compared to other brands. I ended up returning this product right before the 30 days and just use speaker on my cell phone.  It's the same as using this product because I had to take the device off the visor and hold anyways since it was not good otherwise.
B00C7TAF3Y|5.0|Awesome game tons of fun great graphics and experience can't wait for more. Like I said tons of fun and excitement
B0091THDOM|5.0|Quality materials put together with attention to detail.  I am enjoying the way it protects my phone without being a nuisance to use.  A very nice product that arrived on time and as advertised.
B004TI1WME|2.0|Maybe this app was designed to work on a smart phone. I could not even input anything from my Transformer. Uninstalled it after about an hour of having others try where I may have failed. We all had the same results.

B000HKYA1I|4.0|Beautifully acted, powerful story about the way the past shapes how we see ourselves. The film is a bit slow, but go with it, there is power and meaning in the silences.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|Love this game. I look forward to the different daily challenges and missions. Love that the scenery has been changing to different cities.
B000FBFN1U|5.0|If you liked the previous books, you will like this one. I do get a bit irritated with the author when he kills off characters that I like, or hits too hard on the idea that life is not fair
B00AGOGOLE|2.0|Hard to use a  camera when you don't have a view finder unless you will be the subject  in all the pictures.
B003XOXPMK|5.0|This description says it is the 1967 version which is important because the new version(2007 I think) has removed some songs and added others that were not on the 1967 version. Example: Crossroads, and a couple others. The 1967 version is a great album.
B007TBZ63Y|5.0|Posted from my UK amazon account<br /><br />The Percy Jackson books were brilliant, they blended myth and modern perfectly and there was rarely a page that went by that wasn't gripping and action packed. Riordan's new Heroes of Olympus series is no different. There is enough adventure and action to please readers of all ages and plenty of history and mythology to keep fans of Percy Jackson more than happy. It follows a similar plot to the Percy Jackson books, in that demigods must stop an evil force and fulfill an ancient prophecy. But that similarity does not detract from the sheer enjoyment this, and all of Riordan's other books, brings.<br /><br />This series looks set to be just as brilliant as Percy Jackson. Don't miss out!
B00CRR5YA0|4.0|I loved Michael Giacchino's soundtrack for the 2009 Star Trek movie. But I have to disagree with the other reviewer here. While I don't think Giacchino is just \\"rehashing of old themes,\\" this soundtrack isn't nearly as distinctive as its predecessor. Aside from a few tracks, most casual listeners probably couldn't tell this soundtrack apart from the 2009 soundtrack. For example, even the intro theme is similar to the 2009 intro, but somewhat abbreviated.<br /><br />One of the stronger points of the soundtrack is the \\"The Kronos Wartet.\\" The chorus provides a unique sound for a Trek movie, but still manages to sound like a Klingon theme. It sounds like something you would hear on Kronos. I haven't seen the movie yet, but I imagine this track will give the movie a more operatic feel.<br /><br />Overall, I certainly don't mean to complain about this soundtrack. If you want more of Giacchino's Trek music, Into Darkness does the trick. In a way, it almost feels like an expansion pack for the original soundtrack. I'm perfectly happy with that given that I loved the original, but if you were lukewarm about the original then Into Darkness won't give you anything new.
B00C7TAF3Y|5.0|Really fun and engaging. An extra star because there was never a moment where the pixels were misaligned or the code didn't match the image. Can't wait for more!
B009VIZDLI|5.0|My librarian recommended this as a good holiday read and it definitely was. I thoroughly enjoyed this unlikely love story. To some degree it was a nice alternative to the modern dating website idea that like attracts like and that enjoying similar music, movies and hobbies is the surefire way to find love. The two main characters couldn't be more different and yet there is some understandability to their attraction. Don (an Asbergers University professor in Genetics) has commenced a &#34;wife project' with an exhaustively precise questionnaire to weed out all unsuitable candidates. He accidently meets Rosie who is trying to find out who her biological father is and Don's genetic expertise is just what's needed to help solve the mystery aspect of the book. Thus Don commences 'The father project' with Rosie. There is much to laugh at about Don's social awkwardness and Simsion never lets the character become an object of total derision. He is frustratingly likeable and the reader is drawn in to caring about the outcome for both Rosie and Don. Sometimes I found Don's speech a little inconsistent with his character, perhaps getting too relaxed and colloquial for the type of character he was meant to portray, but others may not be concerned about this. I would be interested to know what an Asbergers would think of the story. Certainly a great read and one I have recommended to others.
B007J4T2G8|5.0|It was so addicting. It really feels like your life is intertwined with the book (or so you'll wish) with E L James' so descriptive context!
034580404X|5.0|I have to say I was pretty apprehensive about reading these books thinking I wanted something more than smut.  An acquaintance told me that really it's a love story.  So I gave it a try and wow, I could not put these down!  I read book two in just one day becuase I could not wait to see where these two very young character's and their challenged relationship go.  Now that I am done with all three books I have sense of loss, I just want to read more.  I really liked the very end when the author tells the thoughts of Christan and how he can not understand these foreign feelings he is experiencing of a \\"vanilla\\" woman, I could have loved reading more of that perspective. If you have any trepidations about reading this series becuase you think it is all about sex, it's so not at all. This story truly is about compromise in a relationship and what it means to be open, honest, and feel unconditional love for yourself and someone else.
B00192KCQ0|5.0|Metallica are back with their 8th studio album and their first in over 5 years. Everything they've done from their '83 debut \\"Kill 'em All\\" to their '91 \\"Black Album\\" was excellent. I was even a fan of St. Anger, sure it wasn't as good as their older stuff but I thought it was the best they had to offer since The Black Album. Death Magnetic is an excellent return to form and the only bad thing is the production, although nowhere near as bad as St. Anger. They went back to their heavier thrash roots from '88 \\"...And Justice For All\\" and it has the same progressive edge also. Death Magnetic is their best studio album since \\"...And Justice For All\\" and even surpasses \\"The Black Album\\" by a small step.<br /><br />Highlights: Broken Beat And Scarred, That Was Just Your Life, End Of The Line, Cyanide, The Day That Never Comes

B00004R99F|5.0|We have been watching this movie for years and needed it on DVD. We also gave it as Christmas gifts so now everyone has their own copy for their own homes!
B000SCHBGQ|5.0|Wow! What an amazing story!<br /><br />Scott's characters are as intriguing and addictive as his settings, world-building and historical perspectives.<br /><br />I simply could not put this down. In fact, I used it as rewards (and bribes) for each task I got done. For example, \\"if you mow the yard, then you can read a couple more chapters.\\" LOL! Worked like a charm!<br /><br />Totally divine and beyond magickal!!!
B005S9EK5Y|5.0|Bought it as a gift.  Already saw the movie.  It was very impressive, especially with captions.  Will watch it again.
1400069289|4.0|I have to say that I agree with some of the readers that found that the author does not go deep on how to overcome bad habits...such as gambling addiction, food compulsive behavior or sex addiction.  In this sense I must say that the author instead deals with the habit formation process, how this process is placed in our lymbic system (a primitive part of our brains) and how this habit process is actually the way our brains optimize the thinking and learning process.  In this point of view is great!!!  I agree that the topic regarding the FABRICE product was very long as well as the toothpaste part of the book was very long in terms of stating the topic....this chapters should be revised in the next edition as well as giving more insight in the topic of brain science.<br />The whole topic of  bad habits can be summarized in the following :  if you are awake while you are doing this unwanted behavior is your responsability to look for help to overcome it.<br /><br />I really recommend this book as an introduction to Habits and behavior themes.

B009D8RJR2|5.0|The characters in this book, like other Micheal Connelly novels, are like friends to keep you company. The legal twists and turns are interesting and credible. I have read most of his books and to me this one is on a par quality wise with the other Lincoln Lawyer or Harry Bosch novels. I actually haven't finished the book, and I have found that this author can often surprize you with the final ending.

B008673ZAQ|5.0|I really enjoyed it, a nice quick and unpretentious. So much better than the first book. It was really good and I recommend it for those who like the genre.
B003GYEGNO|4.0|Good book but a little long.  I could do without the ridiculously long clothing descriptions.  And the British guy deserves a punch in the face!

B000O8OTNC|5.0|I have a traditional stone sharpening kit that I like but is a little to heavy and odd shaped to carry around camping or to put in a B.O.B. So I looked into some reviews and found this one was well liked, I was not disappointed by this purchase.<br /><br />Likes:<br />-Small size lanyard attachment point.<br />-Creates a nice sharp edge on all my knives.<br />-Was able to sharpen my kukri in this thing which I wouldn't suggest but I gave it a shot for S&G<br /><br />Dislikes:<br />-Hard to get a good grip in order to use the diamond sharpener<br /><br />Conclusion: I love it, No idea the longevity of it but with casual use throughout the year, it is still working well.
0062124293|1.0|I gagged my way through the first half of this book and then decided not to waste a minute more of my life reading it.  The reason I bought it was due to a book group I belong to.  Not one person in the group liked the book at all and we are a group of women ranging in age from late 20's - early 70's.  If you want to hear about someone's quest for naming her body parts, then this is the book for you!
B001ANSSDC|5.0|Different to the movie, but this is a good thing as you can enjoy both without one letting ruining the other for you.

B00821OX98|1.0|Why do Hollywood producers make movies with aliens who appear have the ability to create technologies to travel across galaxies  yet posses no prehensile hands?  Why are their robots bipeds which has got to be the worst possible design for a war machine?  Why does this particular alien species have the ability to build enormous structure to house their air force but has no ability to see a huge migration in plain sight during daylight hours?<br /><br />Because this series was designed to appeal to the lowest denominator and reap in huge piles of cash.  If you like the above then you'll love this series.

B007EECSFA|4.0|Intriguing story with something for everyone. I couldn't put  it down and never knew what was  really going on, the end was a surprise! The characters were endearing and well developed.  None of them were perfect but for the most part they had redeeming characteristics.  Well, perhaps all characters except Henry Jenkins, every story needs a villain!

B004GHNIRK|3.0|Great book, but way too long.  Took months to get through -- months I could have been reading other great, but shorter, books!
193700788X|2.0|I haven't enjoyed it since book 9 but have somehow been compelled to see the series through.  It's been obvious for awhile (from spoilers the author handed out, as well as the direction of the plot) that Sookie and Eric weren't going to work.  They finally imploded in this book in what I thought was a really empty and unemotional way.  Sookie gets together with Sam, also in an unemotional way.  I always liked Sam and figured that's who she'd end up with (though a part of me always rooted for Eric anyway), but there was no build up to it at all.  Break up with Eric, Sam professes feelings, Sookie says hey, me too, the end. Blah.<br /><br />The plot was also blah.  I hate the way things went with Claude.  And Sookie got kidnapped, to be tortured.  Again.  Clearly Ms. Harris ran out of good ideas about 5 books ago.

B00B4VI8MQ|4.0|I like this game. Best part compared to many others I've played is they don't have you running beck and forth between scenes.there have been games you have to go back to a scene 4 or 5 times to obtain one object. To much wasted time. So far this is much better. Somewhat challenging but not extremely hard. The seek & find area's are a bit small. Other wise very enjoyable.
B005ZOBNOI|5.0|At first I didn't want to read this story thinking that it would be sad. I found this story to be heartwarming and I'm so glad I did read it.
B008476HBM|5.0|Honestly, I had no idea what this book was about. Whether it was from ignorance or a disregard, I can't say.<br /><br />The first 100 pages or so were almost unpleasant to read. The story and characters take a wonderful (and expected) turn that really drew me in. Everything about it was enjoyable from that point on.<br /><br />For other male readers, I hate love stories and I'm not a fan of chick flicks or anything of the sort, but I loved this book.
B00C5ZORES|5.0|This is a great album. After hearing the 2 singles I was really excited to hear the full album. I like 10 of the 11 tracks, that rarely happens. I have liked Fall Out Boy in the past but this album is great. It is fun music that I can listen to on repeat.
B003B02PF4|1.0|I rented this book from my public library with the new ebook programs they now have to do that. I couldnt get into the book at first and went to read another that I had checked out after that one and forced myself to go back and try cause afterall it is a book by John Grisham and I wouldn't want to miss out on something good from him just cause I couldn't get into it from the beginning.  So I went and started reading again and almost half way through the book I couldn't wait for this book to end. I debated on just stopping but I have a thing for finishing a book if I have read a lot of the authors books and they had been good but with this one I wish I would have stopped  wasting my reading time with this one . I also felt the ending of the book sucked and left you hanging. I hope Grisham comes out with some better books cUse I been readding Mark  Gimenez and let me tell you he is really really good and the critics rave on him being the next Grisham but if he keeps putting books out like The Broker we are doomed!  Just my opinion! If you like grisham try the author I mentioned,  you willnot be disappointed.

B001ECDVKE|5.0|I grew up in the '50s and loved all of the sci-fi thrillers of the time.  Even as a kid, I noticed they weren't perfect.  But, they were great fun.  &#34;Mars Attacks&#34; reminds me of the best of those schlocky 50's sci-fi movies - but in a very good way.  The special effects are excellent.  And, in color too.  Grab a bag of popcorn and have fun.
0312539525|5.0|This story is based on the life of mountaineer George Mallory who didn't come back from his last attempt to reach the summit of Mt. Everest in 1924. Mallory was last seen, \\"going strongly for the summit.\\" But did he reach it? And can a thriller writer like Jeffrey Archer keep us interested in a book without his usual twists and turns in the plot? Can he keep us interested when we know how the story has to end? The answer is a resounding yes, I believe, to all three questions.<br /><br />I must admit I'd never heard of George Mallory before this story. I don't know why, I guess because he'd never made that honor roll and I suppose if you include him then Sir Edmond Hillary's name would have to come off. But then maybe it makes no difference, because I would think a climb wouldn't really be considered successful if you didn't come back alive.<br /><br />Anyway, that not withstanding, this is a page turner. Mr. Archer certainly as a way with words, he keeps you wanted to know what comes next, even when you do know. That is something only a great writer can do. Whether or not you believe Mallory reached the summit shouldn't keep you from reading this fine story. It'll keep you up, maybe even make you want to climb something.

0061777269|5.0|Mr. van Lommel has, in this book, put together a one stop overview of the NDE.<br /><br />NDEs are ready to give our culture what it dearly needs- a view of spirituality that avoids the dogma and superstitious platitudes of religion.  Science as it is practiced fumbles with the magnitude and life-changing scope of the NDE, either attempting to reduce it to one of its infamous 'nothing buts' or ignoring it altogether.  But van Lommel is a long practicing surgeon, and knows what he's talking about when he tells us that the phenomenon is not reducible to mere hallucination or fantasy.  This book covers the subject, and well, from what history has to tell us about the NDE to the medical aspects, and the effects to the experiencer as well- all in a clear, grounded manner that still shows his awe at what the NDE is pointing towards.  Van Lommel, despite his authority, knows he's well over his head here, as are we all, but he does an admirable job documenting what we know, and what we can know.<br /><br />If you only read one book on NDEs, this would be a good candidate.  The only flaw is that I think he could have included more actual NDE accounts.  For those, I'd suggest going to NDERF.ORG and reading some of the page 'extraordinary NDEs'.  Amazing, life changing stories.  I've read several hundred and can easily say they've changed my life by just reading them- I can only imagine what it's like to have one, and I'm thinking that one day I shall, as will we all, even if we must remove the 'N'!<br /><br />What an amazing reality we live in.  Sometimes it's hard to see that- if we could only get a glimpse of the Other Side- and we can, in a way, by studying this most profound of human events.  Materialism threatens our world with its nihilism.  It's time we all educated ourselves and took up arms against this pernicious philosophy.  The study of NDEs is a very powerful tool to this end, and this is perhaps the single best book on the subject.  Check out Chris Carter's books as well.s as well.
B00BMKDTNC|5.0|The greatest book series I have ever read finally comes to a conclusion. I will forever compare all books i read to those of The Wheel of Time. The characters, the mythos and the intertwining story lines will capture you and you think you know what will happen, but you will always be pleasantly surprised.

B0015DROBO|3.0|When I read that the book was about a computer hacker, I expected to find some interesting information about how the hacker's mind works and how the hacking is done.  I admire the intellectual capacity of a person who understands computers that well, but I would like the hacker to use his/her abilities for good purposes.<br /><br />  When there are such graphic descriptions of extreme violence in a book, the description of the book should state this so that a reader will be informed before making his/her decision about reading the book. I have to wonder why the author felt it necessary to go into such detail on the violence.<br /><br />  Some of the book held my interest, and I wanted to see what would happen next.  However, I found parts of it would just drag on and on and cause me to turn off my Kindle until I could cope with reading the book again.  To me the description of all the business ventures of the Vanger family and of Wennerstrom (along with the mention of so many bank accounts) was very boring.  When I am reading names with which I am not familiar, I don't recognize certain names as male and others as female.  It didn't help that Blomkvist called Erica \\"Ricky\\".  In my opinion way too many last names began with a B.<br /><br />  I wish the Kindle version would have had a list of characters with a brief description of each one and an easily accessible link to that list; Kindle's version could also provide such a link to the family tree the author included. I see that the Shelfari Community has put a list of characters on the amazon page for the book.
B00BUCW54Q|3.0|Story rescued by Duvall's cantankerous old Marine, but both that character and the lack of physical presence from Mr. Cruise means a big departure from Lee Child's wonderful, spare novels.  Script moves quickly, and the direction is serviceable.  Worth a watch, but it won't warm the hearts of Reacher fans.
0446614459|5.0|I'd read a couple reviews that really slammed this book, so when a good friend loaned it to me, I was almost afraid to read it. But, of course, I did. I mean we're talking about David Baldacci, after all, the man who has been responsible for several sleepless nights at my house. \\"Absolute Power,\\" \\"The Winner,\\" and the stunning, \\"Saving Faith,\\" masterpieces all. Baldacci's books are about entertainment, and my Lord he entertains. He takes us out of our lives and plants us squarely with his characters. No longer are we office workers, nurses, truck drivers or librarians.<br /><br />Still, after those horrid reviews, I was afraid, for I've never picked up a book by this man that I didn't thoroughly enjoy. There are so few writers out there that can quicken our hearts, it would be sad if we were to lose one. But after the first page, I knew those reviewers, those professional people that read books before they come out, were wrong.<br /><br />Yes, some might say the premise is impossible, but it's not to those of us who are still wondering who killed JFK. And besides, isn't that what thrillers are supposed to be about, taking an impossible premise and making us believe in it and believe me, David Baldacci makes you believe in his plot and care for the people who walk through his pages.<br /><br />I loved this book and I'm gonna read it again before I have to give it back. \\"Split Second\\" is a five star offering and if I could give it a sixth or even a tenth star, I would.<br /><br />Those people in that professional reviewing organization that said this book's characters were flat are just plain full of hooey, and if I wasn't a lady, I'd tell you just what else they're full of. Yes, our heroes do a lot of wondering and figuring, but I was wondering and figuring right along with them. And maybe the book leans a tad bit more to the mystery genre than his other thrillers, but so what? The last thing a reader wants from an author are carbon copies of past successes.<br /><br />David Baldacci has giving us a fine body of work, but he certainly doesn't have to use any of it to prop up \\"Split Second.\\" This book can stand by itself very well. It would have been every bit the success it's going to be, even if it would have been Mr. Baldacci's first novel. Clint still would have been in the movie.<br /><br />However. there is that one nagging worry that still tingles at the back of my mind. We eventually find out who assassinated presidential candidate Clyde Ritter, but we are still left wondering who killed JFK. That, of course, is not Mr. Baldacci's fault, but wouldn't you like to know?<br /><br />Again, this is most definitely a five star thriller-slash-mystery. I can't recommend it highly enough./>David Baldacci has giving us a fine body of work, but he certainly doesn't have to use any of it to prop up \\"Split Second.\\" This book can stand by itself very well.

076244911X|5.0|This is my new favorite Kylie fashion photo book! The book is page after page of full color images of Kilie in her many sexy and glamorous outfits over the years. There are both familiar images and new images that are presented in chronological order from her Locomotion video to the present. Photos are pulled from video shoots, magazines, calendars, cd covers, live shows and more. Even if you think you've seen it all there is fresh imagery to look at. This is very thorough and the emphasis is on fashion so most of the comments relate to the clothes and styling. A big plus is that this is not a design-y type book in the layout (like la-la-la) which is good because the photos are the main star here presented in a clean way. There are a few concept sketches of some costumes but mostly its photo after photo. If you like looking at Kylie's costumes and fashions then you cannot go wrong with this book. What a fun way to look back at all of those sexy images from past to prsent. Highly recommended and worth every penny.
B00BOLE7X0|4.0|Slow pacing saved by wonderful cinematography.  Sally Field's Mary Todd nearly steals the movie from the exceptional Mr. Lewis.  Writing for Mr. Seward and others stuck to rather flat and obvious lines but on the whole a decent historical narrative.  Scenes accentuating ongoing racial tensions unsolved by the war seem anachronistic and forced.  Well worth a watch, and a good addition to anyone's movie collection.
B00992CF6W|5.0|So this game is not a ripoff or a scam.  When you get it you will be addicted to it.  But the best part is that you do not waste it money

B004Y1USV2|4.0|This is good. Different, but good.<br />To me this sounds like what would have followed Drama. Benoit David sounds MUCH more like Trevor Horn than Jon Anderson. And it's the same band, except that Trevor Horn produced this instead of performing vocals.<br /><br />Just a short note on Trevor Horn. For the Drama tour Yes opened with Close To the Edge. As soon as Trevor started singing there was an audible gasp from the audience, he sounded EXACTLY like Anderson and instantly people stood, showing their appreciation with a lengthy standing ovation during the opening. It was pretty amazing. I have seen Yes 22 times since 1969 and that show was amazing, even without Anderson.

B00AFEXRME|2.0|I\\"m not sure what I was expecting, but, it wasn't this. It was like they had Denzel around and a crummy movie on hand to be filmed and they came up with this. It's a story of an alcoholic pilot more than anything. I guess I was expecting more about a pilot in general. It OK for a time filler, but, not a great Denzel piece of work.
B009NY43NY|4.0|I must say I am surprised at the overwhelmingly negative reviews.  I enjoyed the book and felt it was a nice wrap up to the series.  I must agree that the transition in Sookie's love life is rather abrupt, but I always thought she would end up with the person she did end up with.  And I agree with the reviewer who felt she has become a strong, self sufficient woman who will survive whatever life throws at her.
B00992CF6W|2.0|If you could improve the controls it would be amazing. I really enjoy the xbox and pc game, but honestly dont see me playing this much. Sorry Notch

B0058RCVYS|4.0|This movie was recommended by a friend, and I am so glad I watched it. I'm now a huge fan of Mads Mikkelsen! There was some suspense and some very strong performances. Someone once said its hard to see a movie anymore that &#34;makes you feel something.&#34; This movie fills that bill.  It is emotional in some parts...heart-wrenching even, so be aware. Might need to be in the right mood. And there are subtitles. I am very glad Amazon offered this and I enjoyed the movie.

0679745203|4.0|Reading a novel like &#34;The Color Purple&#34; could be a daunting task if one was not prepared for the stream of consciousness that connects the plot.  But if you have already seen the movie, the book could provide a richer and more complex experience.  The same could be said for &#34;The English Patient.&#34;  Unlike the movie, the book did not focus on the star-crossed lovers.  For me, it was more the intersection of 4 lives all searching for for redemption amidst their personal history.  I ordered &#34;The Cat's Table&#34; just to try out another of Ondaatje's works.
B005FFW46S|3.0|Solid. I always enjoy Pratchett, but I really enjoyed this one. I couldn't really put my finger on what, but it was good.

B004ZMWUCU|4.0|To say I liked this book is not quite an apt description. It moved me in a sad and profound way. The scenes of cruelty and depredation were so sad but the character's trump was sweet. Grab your hanky and settle in for a good read.
B007HC3LHS|4.0|The author did a great job in creating the characters, which is what makes this book excellent.<br /><br />The theme is similar to Nicholas Sparks' Safe Haven (minus the cheesy love story).  I won't mention it cause it is basically the plot of the entire book (although I am guessing other reviewers will have hinted on it).  However, this has a darker and scarier feel.  This is because of the way Haynes has allowed us into the minds of the book's central characters.<br /><br />I loved it.  I can see why it is a book club favorite - lots to talk about and discuss.

B00AEJM6H2|5.0|This is my favorite \\"jewel matching\\" game....and it's free!  I paid for Bejeweled 2 when I got my 1st generation Kindle Fire, and it's not as pleasing as this free app.  I have friends who feel the same way.  The visual and sound effects are much more vivid, exciting and fun on the Jewels Star game.  It's challenging to go back and try to achieve all three stars on each level of the game.
B0052RE4MQ|3.0|I liked the book though not as much as the first. Characters are the same as the first book with a few new additions. Action and good story. The main characters Ky and Cassia`s relationship did not develop any more. Nice read. Will finish the trilogy.
B008DVJO8C|5.0|Wow.  I was reviewing some of their older songs and I must say.. I think I like the direction they went in with this album.  Really hits the core and the girl is beautiful.  She really knows how to adapt to the situation and good lyricist. I really like it.  I'm not one to listen to this kind of music or would go out of my way to purchase this kind of music, but glad that I did.  It really empowers. I like it.

B008UUPOVM|5.0|I recently attended the Maroon 5 concert where Owl City opened for them.  Before that there were only 2 songs I knew by them, but really enjoyed them.  So I came home and looked up the songs they sang and they were all on this album.  Most of the album is awesome and I recommend purchasing it it you like even 1 of their songs.
B006M4F67A|4.0|This is a fun and various games of Mahjong.  I would advise anyone to buy this program cause it is fun to play .

B0076DCT2G|3.0|Good read. Went a little slow  in sections. Pays off with a sprint to the end. Good tie in with Wild Fire.

B008Y2FRFO|5.0|This game is mindless, pointless, and extremely addictive.  It brings me back to playing in the coin arcades on the Jersey boardwalk as a kid.
B00ABGEFWC|5.0|I opened it after downloading it for my eight year old daughter...now I can't put it down! Maybe my daughter will get to play it!
B00AKKTDJY|1.0|I bought this game thinking i was going to enjoy<br />but when i downloaded to android tablet it will<br />not pull up and no matter what i do it will not work.<br />I paid for the game and it will not work so of course<br />I don't like it! it does not work
B0097EWK3A|4.0|First time playing a game in this genre and I enjoy it a lot. I'm rating it 4 stars since I just started it but may need to up it to 5 by the end.
B008ASGP3U|5.0|I love John Rebus and his flaws. What a wonderful rebirth to a new case and perhaps a new life. John is rogue, off the reservation and an old school do Gooder. I love the chances he takes and the self deprecation he shares with us all. I love mysteries and know that Rankin is among the best out there.
B009NY43NY|3.0|In my humble opinion It really isn't as bad as others have written, but I do feel a little cheated.  Since this was her last novel I thought Sookie would have a little better ending and a little more delving into some of the traditional wittiness of the past books.  Parts of this book were pretty dry but honestly they were in line with the last two. The last three books were certainly not my favorites of the series and I feel like Sookie's character has been lost.  I am glad the series is ending rather than staying on the current path, Charlaine knows when the time has come to end the progression.<br /><br />Thank you Charlaine Harris for years of entertainment!
B00992CF6W|5.0|What a fun game.  I really like how creative I get to be.  I'm glad the price dropped to $3.99.
B002S395DK|3.0|UPDATED<br />__________________<br />First of all, I love this album and would give it 5 stars, easily. This review is only my thoughts on the vinyl release.<br /><br />Amazon was great, as always. I ordered this vinyl and [[ASIN:B000069AUH another one]] on Monday and received both of them on Wednesday. The artwork is very nice looking, as well. the front, back, and two inside covers feature variations on the tiger cover with different animals (Tiger, Baboon, Lion, Wolf) and the label of the two EPs are the triad logo and the circle/4-corners logo. Unfortunately, when I opened This Is War, I noticed that there was a dent of sorts in one of the LPs. The dent itself didn't seem to cause any skips, but it is not good to see in a brand new vinyl.<br /><br />The audio quality also leaves much to be desired. At low levels there are constant cracks and pops, making it sound like an old, worn out record. At louder levels the audio sounds either very thin or distorted. The other vinyl that I received sounds crystal clear, so I know it isn;t an issue with my turntable/speakers.<br /><br />This could have simply been a bad pressing, but it was also the last one that Amazon had in stock. Amazon customer service was incredibly helpful and I will be returning the vinyl for a refund and buying it from somewhere that still has it in stock<br /><br />Update; I got a new copy from Amazon. The new one that I got still had the same dent-type thing, but it didn't seem to have any effect on the playing of the vinyl. The sound is still not as clear as some of the records I own but it's better than the first copy I received. I'm pretty happy with it overall and although it isn't 100% perfect, if you actually want one, I don't think you'll feel like you wasted $20
B00B4VI8MQ|4.0|Fun hide and seek game. Challenging puzzles too. Liked looking for items in the different levels of the game and story line.
B009U9S6FI|4.0|Out of the life of this holocaust survivor come many insights on the meaning of life . At times it slips into psycho babble yet out of the horrors of the authors life and experience of the holocaust he has extracted  truths for the living of our lives.
B004ZMWUCU|5.0|I picked this book on a whim from the library. It is not the type of story I typically read. I was on vacation and finished a Ken Follett book. I had offered my kindle to my wife to read The Misremembered Man, but not having used the Kindle before she decided on a different avenue.<br />Anyway, what's important was that this was a wonderful, uplifting story whose subject matter is in part depressing.<br />The characters are well developed. \\"If only I could meet Rose or Paddy or even Jamie for goodness sake.\\"<br />That's how real they felt. Flying in from the east coast today I was really having a difficult time holding it together; meaning I was laughing so hard at the antics of these folks in the story.<br />This is a must read<br />Well done Christina McKenna and thanks for giving us this book
B006MW3UZW|5.0|Story and characters you can get involved with that invokes several emotions while watching.  That's why I enjoy watching the whole season all at once.
B000HT3PPG|5.0|Why I choses this rating is basically once a year the tv industry would play this movie.  I would curl up with a bowl of popcorn when living in Wisconsin and watch this show.  Each time it seemed like it was a new movie and never seen before because of the month of the year it was televised once a year.  The holiday Spirit and emotion was attached to this movie.  I truly believed in what the movie was conveying.  It is how I treated my life up to now.  Whenever I did sales in retail I did exactly what Santa had done in this movie and that's how I became a top performer.
B00AQMSJI2|4.0|Good fun game. Confusing at first and a little after that lol. My seven year old loves it. Cannot advance without spending real money :(
B0063HBPH6|5.0|An old boyfriend introduced me to Aziraphale and Crowley and once I read the book I realised where so many of his quotes and mannerisms and perculiar behaviour came from.<br /><br />Reading it twenty years later I realise where many of MY quotes and mannerisms and perculiar behaviour comes from. This is a highly influential book. It's terribly dry and witty and droll. It's just wonderful. Not to mention this ebook edition came with a little commentary from Neil and Terry and it was just delightful to get into their heads and swim about for a while. And it's just wonderfully encouraging to those who write to keep on writing and enjoy it. I wish I were them and this my work :)<br /><br />Just read it. You won't regret it.
B00BHNR1KQ|4.0|Not to many movies get me creeped out, but this one did. Too bad the ending was kind of lame.

Billy Beane is such an interesting character and really paved the way for a new way to look at the management of professional sports.

B007BVOEPI|1.0|Maybe it's just me but I watched the first episode with anticipation only to be horrified by the themes presented; A power-humgry brother who sells his sister into what promises to be a brutal, barbaric marriage, an incestuous relationship that has no struggle throwing a loveable 10 year-old boy to his death to hide their actions... The world can be dark enough without watching more for \\"entertainment\\".
B0047Y0FGY|5.0|I thoroughly enjoyed Ms. Fey's book Bossypants and her life story that's told with honesty,  openness and best in a style that weaves her amazing wit and sense of humor throughout from start to finish.

B006M4F67A|5.0|Awesome product and a overall fun game to play I'm a huge fan of these games and this is a big thumbs up
B009NY43NY|4.0|First of all, I would give this a five but do feel there was a little lack of \\"fullness\\" to this final book. Saying that, however, I sense both Ms. Harris and Sookie were getting tired.<br /><br />I view these books as a journey. Sookie started as a very misunderstood, wall flower of a person who, through her adventures in the supernatural world discovered who she really was. She made friends and enemies. Time and again she found herself in difficult situations and managed to rise above them and to grow through them.<br /><br />One reviewer wrote Eric was always in her corner and, while this was true, it was always a turbulent corner. The only safe constants in Sookie's life were actually Sam and her roots. I also believe, Sookie realized she didn't actually need a man in her life at all. She's not settling for Sam. She doesn't have to settle for anything. She has her home, her family and her friends. She has come full circle and is ready to accept who she is, and where she is. Something every woman needs to do to be complete.<br /><br />A continuing relationship with Eric would eventually yield her none of the things she truly values: children, grandchildren, a Stackhouse legacy. I can much more easily imagine Sookie raising a house full of kids, growing old with Sam and welcoming grandchildren, just as her Gran did, than I can see her being a cold, heartless vampire.<br /><br />Perhaps Ms. Harris could have framed this a bit more clearly if she had spread it over another book or added another 1,000 pages but I had a feeling it was headed this way from the previous books. In fact, I have thought for some time it would be Sam or a were, never a vampire. Sookie likes to cook too much!

B000QZUIQA|4.0|I love Smash, it is so aggressive yet restrained. Very good music.<br /><br />Avant Garde, free jazz but a lot of fun.
B0042TV4IW|4.0|Delightful characters and wonderful cast.  They draw you into their community and into their personal lives so that you can hardly wait to see the next one.  It is entertaining with many laughable moments. The English accents are hard to understand at times, but that does not interfere  with your enjoyment.
B005BGBPBG|5.0|I had never even heard of this movie before but I am so glad I rented it. I watched it a couple times in the 24 hour period. I enjoyed it that much! I like the characters and actually felt bad for the guy who cheated on his fiance. How does that happen? All of the actors played their roles incredibly. Even the small ones, made an impact.

B005GFPZYK|3.0|I suspect the popularity of this book is the result of the sniper's death at the hands of an ex-military guy with mental problems.<br />I felt sorry for his wife and children. Their dad seemed obsessed with war and couldn't live without it.

B008MG1E4A|4.0|Well written account of how the Seals found and executed Osama Bin Laden.<br />After reading it, I'm convinced that, despite what President Obama said, this was<br />a murder mission. This book was as good as the movie, with even more<br />information.
B00BGIBVP8|3.0|Not my favorite movie.  Some parts are funny but overall it was very predicable and boring.  I would not recommend this movie.
B005ZOBNOI|5.0|This book made me realize how heartbreaking and terrible cancer can be. It also let me see what it would be like to be in that kind of situation. I really wish  you could change the plot of the story and create a happy ending but in reality there isn't happy endings, and that's something I also like about this book is that it's real/true.
B009MYARIK|3.0|I'm always excited to read the any of Sophie Kinsella's books, and have pretty much loved every single one of them.  I am normally able to breeze through them in a couple of days, but this one has been a struggle. It's okay, there is humor, but not the kind that makes my stomach hurt from laughing so hard.
B003O86FMW|4.0|Purely a science fiction read that takes about 2 hours.<br />It's a fun adventure. Collins creates believeable characters in an unbelieveable world.<br />The reader, who isn't reading critically, becomes swept up by the story.

1400069807|5.0|As a former fat guy (nearly ten years strong of having lost 70+ pounds), I know firsthand the stranglehold food companies have on consumers. I was addicted to every form of fat, sugar and salt available -- preferably all in the same food/meal! Now that I am health-conscious, preparing to become a fitness trainer and dietitian, with a wife who just graduated from nursing school, I'm hoping to use books like Salt Sugar Fat: How the Food Giants Hooked Us, as a means of relaying the insidiousness of food giants, and the dangers they impose upon the public.<br /><br />SSF is a well-written, heavily researched book, exposing the dark, predatory nature of food manufacturers, and how they use those three key ingredients to hook us into consuming unhealthy, packaged food in vast quantities. There is obviously an agenda/bias from the onset, so if you're looking for a fair and balanced expose, temper those expectations. But I think most of us know too well the greediness of food corporations, and thus have very little sympathy or interest in seeing their bottom lines are met.<br /><br />The book starts with a secret meeting held among the food giants, such as Kraft, General Mills, Pillsbury, etc., where a well-intention-ed VP of Kraft made a compelling presentation on the dangers their own food companies impose on the health of the public, and how they have an opportunity to step up and present healthier options. Michael Mudd, the VP on stage, was quickly leveled by General Mills head Stephen Sanger, who essentially rebutted with, \\"Look, we're not going to screw around with the company jewels and change the formulations because a bunch of guys in white coats are concerned about obesity.\\" And that, folks, just about sums up the vested interest food companies have in our health. (Note: it isn't just the food companies who are to blame, as Big Tobacco is also in cahoots, as well as greedy politicians)<br /><br />From there, author Michael Moss takes us through what is essentiallya history course on each ingredient, Sugar, Fat and Salt, why we have physiological cravings for them, how the food industry uses this knowledge to manipulate and stimulate certain brain receptors (interestingly enough, sugar has the same effects on the brain as drugs) in order to get us to consume more, and heart-wrenching stories of those whose lives have been directly affected by the food industry. Perhaps the most disgusting portrait of this abuse is the studies conducted using children, where a \\"bliss point\\" (that magical level of ultimate satisfaction) is being discovered through various taste tests of sugary foods.<br /><br />For fans of Michael Pollan, and films like Hungry for Change, you will certainly enjoy Salt Sugar Fat. For those with any interest in their own health, or the health of their families, this is a must-read.

0451529065|4.0|But, it is Number One when it comes to being misunderstood.  How badly can it be misunderstood - well for one thing it does not describe the Theory of Evolution and Darwin had no fear of publishing it whatsoever.<br /><br />Here is the standard line one gets, even from folks with Ph.D.s in biological sciences who ought to know better.  Darwin went to the Galapagos Islands and discovered Evolution.  It was so controversial that he kept the idea secrete for 25 years, because he was afraid of the condemnation of Victorian religious zealots.  (One author who I have reviewed even made the preposterous suggestion that Darwin wanted the theory published posthumously).  Then some other guy we don't remember also discovered Evolution and Darwin had to publish.  The Theory of Evolution then got rid of God and Darwin was hated, but we love him now and he is a hero of science.<br /><br />This could not be more wrong in every detail.  Darwin went on a five year voyage as science officer (Naturalist) of the Beagle the mission of which was to map safe harbors for the British Navy.  On the way he read the third most important piece of 19th century non-fiction, Charles Lyell's Principles of Geology, the most controversial book of the day because it made the earth very old, old enough for the development of new species.  Gradually over the five years of the voyage, working with the ideas of Lyell and Thomas Malthus, Darwin formulated the beginnings of the Theory of Natural Selection.  On return, he knew this theory was incomplete and that he had no credentials as an academic Naturalist.  He worked diligently to correct these deficiencies knowing he would be going up against the legacy of Georges Cuvier, the man who had singlehandedly destroyed Lamarckian evolution.  Then Henry Wallace independently formulated Natural Selection and Lyell and others convinced Darwin to publish simultaneously with Wallace.  The theory did nothing to damage theology and Darwin was a famous and widely respected hero in his own day.  So why the difference in the stories?  People have passionate agendas when it comes to religion or the religion that science has become to some.<br /><br />So what does Origin of the Species really say?  Well this is an academic science book that broke new ground at the time, but its message was not unexpected or even new.  People had been debating the development of new species since Darwin's grandfather, Erasmus Darwin, had proposed a theory years earlier; they just did not have a mechanism for the process.  So Origin of the Species was not written for a popular audience, it was written for the scientists engaged in that debate.  If you do not like Latin names, long discussions of barnacles, extensive references to works you have never heard of and tedious detail, I suggest you read something else.  Or you could just read the first six chapters.  They describe the thesis of the book, starting with something Darwin knew a lot about, `Variation under Domestication,' i.e. animal and plant breading.  Be prepared to learn far too much about pigeons.  Then he discusses `Variation under Nature,' where he applies the mechanisms of domestic breeding to nature.  Then \\"The Struggle for Existence,' an extension of Malthus to all of nature.  Then to `Natural Selection,' a synthetic description of the process by which new species develop.  Then to `Laws of Variation'.  Then to `Difficulties with the Theory.'  Darwin had spent 25 years pondering these `difficulties', so the rest of the book is answers to questions Darwin knew would arise because he had already asked them himself.  This part of the book is now for the most part irrelevant, because subsequent science has answered the questions.  But, at the time the biggest question that loomed was the mechanism for variation.  That remained unanswered and Darwin had no clue where to look for that answer.  He did know that this was the weakest part of the theory; it was the part that most delayed his publication.  There would be no mechanism for variation in a species until 20th century biologists gave us modern genetics.  And the world would wait still longer until other scientists combined Natural Selection with the genetics of variation to have Evolution.<br /><br />So this is an old complicated science book for old complicated scientists.  And, if you like that kind of stuff, it is a delight.  I do, I am a scientist, and I love the way Darwin writes. He is confident, organized, methodical, and lucid if not exactly succinct.  He makes a point, states the counter point and then does his best to demonstrate objectively why his point is correct.  This is the way science should be done.  Nevertheless, he is egotistical and quite possessive.  The theory of Natural Selection is HIS theory, which is his, ahum ahum.  And dooon't you forget it.<br /><br />If you don't want to read a dusty old science book, I suggest \\"Evolution: The Remarkable History of a Scientific Theory\\" by Edward J. Larson.  This book provides the whole story from Cuvier to Douglas Futyama, 225 years of the development of modern biology in layman's terms.  If you do want to understand evolution as science, try \\"Evolution\\" by Douglas J. Futuyma, but your college transcripts better list some advanced biology courses.<br /><br />So what is the most important work of non-fiction of the 19th century?  Why the paper \\"A Dynamical Theory of the Electromagnetic Field\\" by James Clerk Maxwell's of course, published just five years after Origin of the Species.  This little paper is more important than Einstein's 1905 paper on Relativity, because it made Einstein's discovery and the Kindle you read it on possible.  But, you say you have never heard of James Clerk Maxwell?  That is because no one has ever pursued a metaphysical agenda by most unscientifically and unlearnedly trying to use the Theory of Electromagnetism to get rid of God.

B001L1C46A|5.0|I got the japan paper sleeve shm-cd first great sound but loud. the cd/sacd could have had better treatment but a waste indeed, though the dvd 5.1 made up for that. most of the songs on disc 1 are not as loud until you get to the song chambers of 32 doors. but the balance between high and low tones made it sound perfect to the end. the price for lamb was high when it first came out. now it's 3 times higher. the import version is a lot better than rhino edition. better sounding.
B005HJU7HA|5.0|I read all of the Sherlock Holmes books back in high school and am revisting them now, 35 years later. I was so happy to find this set for less than $1 for my Kindle. Definitely worthwhile!
B009M5CJI0|5.0|If you have a passing interest in World War II, but don't eagerly read non-fiction, this book is a must. I read the first novel of Ken Follett's trilogy and came away with an understanding that I never had of World War I. Then to encounter the same five families in this novel was an experience.that felt very personal. I normally resell books once I've read them, but this one has to be kept and read again someday. Considering that it's over 1000 pages long, making it the thickest paperback you've ever had in your hand, that's saying a lot. I highly recommend this book. Read it on vacation, though, because you won't get much else done.
B007J4T2G8|5.0|I can't believe this one could be better than the other two but yes it was I loved how all makes sense at the end I simply loved it I would like more. I read the trilogy twice
030758836X|5.0|This is an amazing book and should be on everyone's read list!  Oh wow was all I could say as I read this book and people around me would just look at me funny as i read because I couldn't help but gasp as I read.
B00ADQCBEY|4.0|Though I was torn about the star of the show being a dirty cop who in cold blood murdered another officer, I could not help but to continue watching episode after episode, the show was really good.
0792839749|5.0|I choose this rating because I have always loved this movie and everything in it.<br />Dick van Dyke is just great, Sally Ann Howes is awesome, and so is Lionel Jeffries too.  I love the kids. I love the fun and glorious way the make the imagination sparkle.<br />I would recommend everyone for this.
B007IXWKUK|5.0|It was so good I read it in 3 days I practically eat the book and reading it in my kindle is so much better than in a regular book
B003UBTX6S|5.0|It makes you vent to friends who haven't read the books, don't know what your talking about, and don't care about what your talking about. All you'll care about is letting somebody know how you hate this character and love the other one. Or how you can't believe she did that, whatever it was. I could not put it down. This book was incredible.
B004G6009K|5.0|Fantastic movie, great service :) I highly recommend this movie for anyone who loves disney and all the magic wonders that follows.
B00992CF6W|5.0|I love minecraft it's awesome it's a great app it has great value it's one of the best games ever
B007IXWL2C|5.0|Best money spent on an adult book. Very well written and it is not obscene I recommend it with my eyes closed
B005LLSZNM|5.0|I have to admit I have been hooked by SOA from the very first episode.  As the first several seasons developed, I began feeling like the show was turning into a soap opera dressed in leathers.  The plot lines revolved around who's screwing who, who's back-stabbing who, who's lying to who... but ultimately, that didn't matter, I eagerly awaited each show.<br /><br />I love the fact that the backstory is based on Hamlet.  That Jax is playing the part of Hamlet, Clay is Uncle Claudius, Jenna is Hamlet's mother Gertrude and JT is the ghost of Hamlet's murdered father.  You could even find parallels between Jax's best friend Opie and Hamlet's good friend Horatio.  About the only one that doesn't fit the scheme is Jax's girl Tara.  She's certainly no Ophelia, that is unless the writers intend on having her go mad and commit suicide.  Still, I like the way the writers have based the story on one of Shakespeare's greatest tragedies. It lends a story a level of class and sophistication that I wouldn't expect in a show about bikers.<br /><br />Another thing I like about the show is its sense of balance.  It's got everything; action, adventure, romance, intrigue, humor, it really has it all.  One week you're watching the Sons shoot it out with the Mayans, and the next week the show has me in practically in tears as Tig mistakenly kills Opie's wife Donna.<br /><br />Can't say enough about the acting.  There are no slouches in this cast.  Jax, Jenna and Clay are all superb.  I've even learned to appreciate the minor characters like the sheriff Wayne Unser.  He does an excellent job, as do the other supporting players like Bobby Elvis, Juice, Chibs and Opie.  Too, villans like Agent Stahl and U.S. Attorney Lincoln Potter are extremely well played and multi-dimensional.<br /><br />Like everyone else, I'm eagerly awaiting season 6.  Can't wait!
B00BR4QNJ0|5.0|so awesome great.glad there's multyplayer.for challengers and compeaters.no bugs great game for hard core gamers.who ever dose not have this game get it.again great game.
B003E8P9G0|5.0|I adore Rick Riordan and his work .Even though I am a little rusty on my ancient Egyptian Mythology, I thoroughly enjoyed the book. I am a percy Jackson fan at heart and always will be, (team Leo) but I think that I can make room for The Kane chronicles. Oh and just to add to the insanity, I LOVE ANUBIS!!!!!!!!!!!
B0070Y46UY|2.0|I spent money on my new kindle buying this book but it is better to watch the movie it is totally boring I fell sleep and never got to second chapter
B0051ANPZQ|5.0|I think this book is great for people of all ages to show them that it is ok be different
B004UJAOLM|3.0|The way these people talk to each other is hard to imagine. The time period is from so long ago, but still...<br />Also hard to imagine what heath & heather & moors look like so had to look them up since I've never been to England.
B00992CF6W|5.0|This game is so dumb, Chloe just does whatever she wants, and says &quot;I win!&quot; This game is not worth the $50.00 I paid for! &gt;:&lt;
B009OYSFDM|5.0|I love comic book movies, but the tv shows haven't been that good.  Arrow is the best show on tv.  Good acting, good story lines, awesome fight sequences, all around the best comic book show ever!
B00CHSPB8Y|1.0|Would not start on Kindle Fire HD that I just bought for grand kids. I will see if I can get it to run on another tablet and might change the rating.
B005GSY23M|5.0|The sound track is a great mix between some adrenaline beats and sweet cruzzing sound.  I would definitely recommend you get this sound track if your a guy who likes to drive around.
B00B2V66VS|5.0|I LOVE YOUR GAME BECAUSE IT IS FUN  LOVING AND FEELING THIS GAME THANK U MOM FOR DOWNLOADING THIS FUN GAME.
0470876417|5.0|While the canvas doesn't capture everything, it does provide a sound structural focus for thinking about your business.  In doing so you can quickly see points of (sorry for using this word) synergy and areas that seem to be questionable.<br /><br />But the real value is how quickly you can visually rethink your business model.  That alone can be a transformative moment.<br /><br />The book is very approachable with its visual design and focus on communicating concepts.  Well worth it.
B008TRUDAS|5.0|There's not much more I can say about Colleen Hoover other than she knows how to write one heck of a story. Lake & her family move out of state after her father dies, to make ends meet. Upon arriving in Michigan her brother Kel immediately makes friends with their neighbor Caulder. Shortly after Lake meets his older brother, Will & there is an immediate attraction. They go out on a date & have a great time. Things seem to be well until Lake reports to class & has a bomb dropped on her. Will tries to make Lake understand why they cannot be together but it doesn't mean it'll be easy on either of them. It takes time but they try to be \\"just friends\\". Lake & Kel are dealt another blow when their mother fills them in on the real reason why they moved. Will uses his own experiences to help Lake cope with the news. The feelings they have for each other never fade & the story is such a great journey for both characters. They both learn that sometimes life gets in the way & they need to make their own choices. This is by far one of the best series I've ever read. Don't hesitate, buy all three books now & dig in...you WILL NOT be disappointed.<br /><br />-I have just experienced the most passionate kiss I've ever received from a guy-and it was on the freaking forehead!
0756655307|5.0|i bought this for my brothers birthday and he loved it.. he loves the comic people and even though he knows all of them he still liked it.
B001ANSSDC|4.0|A beautiful story of life, love and loss. Great character definition. A moving story of struggle and strength with the help of friends and family.
B00COGXGNQ|5.0|The ending had me in tears (in a good way), and I'm not even an emotional person. I really like this movie.
B00B2G2RG6|5.0|It was a little predictable but I still enjoyed watching it. I will enjoy watching it again sometime in the future.
B005UG542S|5.0|No review I write can portray the awesomeness of this movie. I just want to watch it over and over again.
1439152802|3.0|Although this is a nice read it did not live up to the hype and expectations.  I find it difficult to believe the children had so much interest in their mother's past.  Especially the son, who was just a baby when the disturbing incident occurred, other than that he had no reason to give his mother's past a thought.  That bit of doubt stuck with me.
B004MC0FO8|5.0|I was just playing around while a movie was on the TV. Shazam identified the movie and the availability of the soundtrack. So fun, I loved it.
B007REV4YI|5.0|I saw this movie at the movie house already but I had to have it for home and travel viewing.  The price was right and the formats that were included, Blu-ray, Digital copy and UV make it a great deal to own.<br /><br />The movie in itself and being part of the James Bond series is a bonus.
B0061PEAUY|3.0|Love the &#34;Bones&#34; TV show, but this is the first Reichs/Bones novel I have read.  The story frequently gets lost in the details that are not really important to the story--I don't need to know the exact location of every gold or diamond mine in the area, the background of every character introduced, etc.  Simplify, simplify.
0316228532|3.0|This book wasn't horrible, but it was a little much for me. I'm no prude, but even this was a little bit..strong, I guess you could say. I did read the Harry Potter series, and that has probably influenced my review more than I am consciously aware of. The book wasn't bad for a first attempt at something so different, but it seems like she was trying too hard to step out of Harry Potter world and into the adult fiction one. I also feel like the book switches back and forth between characters far too much; it was honestly a bit mind blowing. All in all, not a bad book, but definitely not one that I'll read again and again as I do with most books.
B00AOEA22I|2.0|The music is good, everyone is talented in this group, but these songs are just plain dumb!  There is nothing you haven't already heard before and possibly done better by the 80's pop rock genre.  I would recommend this to 11 year olds who loved Winger and Slaughter.
B002KYHZLQ|4.0|This was the second book by this author that I've read. He builds the character base meticulously and slow, but like a great piece of music, it finishes in a wonderful crescendo.
B00AB7HESI|3.0|I love the game and have played the DS version. However, this game takes SO LONG to download. It made me start the thing over the first time I tried it. Otherwise it is an AWESOME game.
B00COGZ8FU|4.0|I think Tom Cruise does a great job in action movies, and found this one to be enjoyable. My only complaint is that the &#34;villain&#34; in the movie seemed really underdeveloped... I'm guessing maybe the explanatory footage ended up on the cutting room floor. A fun ride nonetheless!
B009NY43NY|3.0|This was probably the most under whelming book in the series. Not a terrible ending but just nothing noteworthy. I have however enjoyed the crap out of this series. I am always happy when I'm reading a Sookie book!
B004GJ1XU2|4.0|The theme in this one is completely weird. All about a dead dude and the living survivors relationship with him.Makes one wonder what will be going on after ones own death.
B00CHSPB8Y|4.0|addictive; almost a quest to unlock all the armors.  playing for three days and making enough progress to stay at it.
0062086529|5.0|Harold and the purple crayon is a wonderful classic tale of imagination that I remember from my childhood.  It is an excellent book to help children ponder the difference between reality and fantasy.  One of the most magical parts of the book is how the pages turn in anticipation of what Harold will draw next.  Timing and the sequential unfolding of the story is critical to the book's magic.<br /><br />As such, the new board book version of Harold is a major distortion of the original magical book.  Pages and words are combined and illustrations completely omitted compared to the original.  As a result most of the magic is lost.  I urge you to buy another version than this Board Book.  I bought them as gifts and had to return them.  If anyone can comment on how faithful the paperback version is to the original story, I would suggest purchasing that for now.  This Board Book is NOT the same magical story.
B00AS1Q93S|5.0|I saw this movie at the theater and knew I had to get the DVD.  I am a big fan of Child's Jack Reacher books and this movie follows the story line exactly.  Plenty of action, and although I am not a big Cruise fan, he shines in this movie.  Jack Reacher is a loner and drifter who always manages to get himself into trouble, particularly helping others.  Cruise displayed these traits perfectly and brought Reacher's character to life.  A must see.
B005SFR7YE|5.0|This dvd is very good and the sound is superb. So colorful.and i enjoyed watching it over and over again.
B008NAFU9A|5.0|Her sweetest downfall is a very unusual and interesting story.  Meeting Ophelia was a real treat.  She's a sweet young lady who circumstances have given a very difficult life, and this journey isn't going to make it any better...in most ways.<br />The fear of having a mark come up \\"out of the blue\\" on your neck one morning, especially in a time and around people who believe all things like this are evil is unimaginable.  To have your father die and your mother disappear is even more disastrous.  Poor Ophelia has had all this happen in her young life.<br />She's a wonderfully if somewhat reluctantly brave young lady with a great mind and keen instincts. She is kidnapped and taken far away by Ethan, a handsome young man with the same mark on his neck that has just shown up on hers.  He tells her of her mission in life and that it will not be an easy one, but to save thousands or more lives, it's one that she must agree to.<br />Convincing her of this mission and all the magic things...things she's only heard of in her mother's tales told to her as a your child is quite a mission in itself.<br />The attraction between Ophelia and Ethan is unique and very dramatic.  To see him fight his attraction knowing he doesn't want to hurt Ophelia and he would really love to keep her with him is heartrending.  I LOVE  the action and twists in this marvelous \\"light\\" read.  The story is intriguing and quite compelling.  It was incredibly hard to put down...so I didn't.  I'm hooked and will get the rest of the Forever Girl series as quickly as possible... I want to be ready for the next one!<br />Ms. Hamilton spins wonderful tales with twists and turns that are both interesting and surprising.  I loved the characters, the dialect was just enough to give the \\"flavor\\" of the times and area.  I found it spellbinding and I definitely need more!  This one is a 5 star on my list!
B002SSUQFG|5.0|I was looking for a watch that I didn't need to replace batteries and that would be very reliable and accurate --- and this more than fits the bill !!
B00B3HJMLM|5.0|I am not a big fan of country music but Luke Bryan changed my mind.  His music has a pop-rock kind of beat that one can really dance to.  His lyrics are not the twangy, gushy love found or lost kind that most country music has.  Suntan City, If You Ain't Here to Party, and Shake the Sand are the best on the tape.  I recommend this for anyone, not just country music fans. I will definitely be purchasing more of his music.
B004HXIZVC|5.0|This is a really great app. I have not had one issue with the application or functions of this app.
B00B99KJR0|5.0|Fun and challenging, this kept me interested in both the story and in solving all the puzzles to the end of the game!
B00991TCOG|4.0|I like Lindsey Stirling's stuff. It's bouncy, fun, quirky, sometimes inspired. I like her music videos and general presentation. I mean, how do you not love someone who writes a piece, shops for set materials, designs the sets, dances as she plays, edits her own video, and produces a music video like Elements - in five days? She's inventive, talented in multiple ways, and easy on the eyes. She does feel good music at its finest.<br /><br />So why not a 5? The album mix. I went for the CD instead of the mp3s because I wanted to hear musical detail. That was a mistake. I know she's an independent musician with her own label, and yay for that, but apparently that means she had to settle for second class engineering.<br /><br />In some songs the violin is mixed \\"to the back\\", behind the wall of electronica that's supposed to be the support and background of the song. It feels like she's playing from crouched behind the drumset instead of out in front; her violin should sound rich and it comes across as thin and vague, sometimes muddy. It's annoying. The electronic instruments are simply harsh at points. (Yes, I know it's deliberate, but it's overdone.) Imaging is messed up; they didn't even try. (And with a performer like Ms Stirling, they could have had her dancing all over the soundstage!) Luckily it's not a problem on every song - Elements, possibly my favorite, was decently done.<br /><br />Is this going to bother you on an mp3 player? Not much. Mix problems aren't a big deal on car stereo speakers or earbuds. Most people will never be in a position to notice the uneven recording quality. But if you're spending the extra 50% for the CD, it's because you're trying to avoid the losses of mp3 compression and have a decent stereo. On a high end stereo you'll find the overall effect tiring, and that's the LAST thing you want from this music.<br /><br />I don't regret buying. I like the music. It just deserves better treatment.
B003TSEEDY|5.0|This book was great! It's a great romance good for teens in high school that are going through a rough time
B000FA675C|5.0|This is one of my favorite books that I have as an adult. Such a great read and it pulls you right in from the beginning.
B008JFUTT0|5.0|My husband and I watched this documentary on one of our paid cable channels last night, and I have to say that it is one of the best that I've seen.  I didn't once get the feeling that the story of Rodriguez was overly embellished or fake; indeed, by the final quarter of the film, I was actually brushing away tears.  That may seem unremarkable, but I'm one of the few who didn't cry during [[ASIN:B0098G7AWS Titanic]], much to the dismay of my female friends.<br /><br />The producers/directors did an excellent job telling the story of \\"Sugar Man\\" Rodriguez.  We were hypothesizing and making predictions throughout the entire film, until the mystery of Rodriguez's death was solved towards the end of the movie.  No spoilers here... the story stands on its own merit.<br /><br />The best part, in my opinion, is the fact that Rodriguez spent his life being a hard-working man who cared about his family, his community, and who loved music.  His legacy is found in everything he touched, and seems to be the epitome of \\"role model\\".  We loved the interviews, the songs and the outcome.<br /><br />Highly recommended!!
B00CL68BK2|3.0|Full of stock characters. The father that can't communicate, the successful child, the child that made some bad choices, the hooker, the good friend'd bitchy wife.<br /><br />Thought the movie had no overall direction or cohesion. I've seen worse films, but this one is not deserving of all the praise and hype.
0142407909|5.0|My son loves the movie and now can act it out with the play.  Also good for getting monologues for theater classes.
B001KZG99A|4.0|I recently saw Iron Man 3 but never saw the other 2. I enjoyed this movie as it was 2 hours of action with bits of comedy...
B0099Y2MYK|5.0|I had to watch the DVD before the season ended in the United States!  All the characters are wonderful and the story lines keep your interest.
B005GFPZYK|5.0|This book was in my Que when his murder took place. It then went to the front. Chris Kyle epitomizes  the American warrior. Thank you sir, for your service. Thank you sir, for your story. RIP
B008AK8FHM|5.0|I really liked this book. I think it is written on a higher level of writing skills. It does a great job explaining his experience through the eyes of a scientist. It's an amazing story.
B002BIULQ2|5.0|My daughter and I have sat down and watched this movie together at least 2 times, and I know she has watched it more since we bought it.  It is a good story and now has my daughter wanting us to find some 'cousins' in the country that we can go visit for a couple of weeks this summer!
B006VFLIYK|5.0|Great read right from page one!  I wouldn't hesitate to recommend this book  and I like the Will Robie character so it's fun to read about him again.
B00ALM822K|5.0|paper towns renders itself my top two john green books because of its clarity and yet subterranean depths that's green is able to take the main protagonists, Margo and Quentin. literally the best pranks you will ever read (for those who have read looking for Alaska, yes even better). definitely a world view changing read
B009MYAQK4|5.0|Thought provoking. I am sure that I will read it a few more times. Another great contribution by Paulo Coelho.
B008XJ8WE6|5.0|This is my family's favorite Broadway play. We have seen it everywhere and it is the perfect way to learn about Joseph from the Bible in a fun way. We received the DVD in a timely basis and I gave it to my friend who had never seen it. They haven't had time to see it yet but I'm sure they will love it as we do.
B00633W614|5.0|I love Jeffrey Archer books because they hold your attention right from the beginning!  I wouldn't hesitate to recommend this book!
B008BSOAPE|4.0|I know that the purpose of this book was to be a little outrageous, and I know that the main character is not inherently likeable. but that isn't why this book is not as good as john green's others. whilst still conveying a meaningful message, if you are used to the awe-inspiring nature of john greens writing all ready I suggest you read all his other books first and this one last.<br />its still awesome. just not as awesome. (awesome has a relativity scale)
B003EV6DBW|4.0|All the extras are well worth while, just wish it included the holiday episodes as well.It seems incomplete when you watch the story and you've missed bits.
B000N2HBSO|4.0|Despite its length, I was captivated by this book.  I completed it prior to seeing the movie.  The movie, however, only deals with about the first 25-30 percent of the timeline this book covers so you will get much more from the book than the movie.  I was really impressed with the detail and wealth of information about Lincoln's travels, especially his travels during the Civil War to visit with his field commanders and meet the Union soldiers who were fighting to preserve the Union.  I was also intrigued to read about the conflicts that Lincoln had with himself and his closest colleagues on a range of issues.  What struck me most was how really central slavery was to the purpose of the Civil War.  I was always under the belief that slavery was just one of 'many' states rights issues.  But after reading this book, I feel slavery was 'central' to the causation of the war because slavery was so central to the southern economy.  I also got the feeling that slavery itself would have withered on the vine even if the Civil War had not occurred.  In a way, the war was the South's last gasp at preserving a way of life that was soon to be 'gone with the wind' anyway.  But I guess that's only speculation on my part.  In any case, Doris Kearns Goodwin is a fabulous historian and storyteller who created a fascinating book that gave me a completely new perspective on the man and his era.  And I would be remiss if I didn't find the information about Mrs. Lincoln equally enlightening and compelling.  Until I read this book, I knew very little about Mary Todd Lincoln or her family.  A great read and one that will not disappoint you.
B0036SUQWA|5.0|Maybe it was because I didn't know what to expect with this movie. I have also never considered myself a fan of George Clooney. Well, enough said - I won't spoil any of it for you. Just watch it!
B005651R24|5.0|will Grayson will Grayson is so well written by two amazing authors that you can hardly tell, and yet are thankful that each author added this entirely new layer to their character that if writing alone, would not have been achieved. again, green conveys the depths of human psyche, proving that just because one is a teenager, it does not make you less worthy of intense emotion and clear as mud logic.
B00B4VI8MQ|4.0|I believe that this game ha s shown a greater challenge than any other puzzle game I have ever played and hope to someday find another game as challenging as this one.
B00C7TAF3Y|5.0|This game was great!  Can't wait to play, many, many more!  Short but really gives your brain a work-out! Lot's of great A-HA moments!  I could play this type of game all day long, and the eerie music really adds to the creepy mood.
B00AZRBLHO|5.0|I've been in the IT field for 32 years and this book could have been written about some of the places I worked.  I found myself shaking my head in sympathy for what was happening.  At alomost the same time I was laughing because that is how IT can sometimes make you do.  No matter what business you are in or do, this book will be easy to understand what might be going wrong and how with just a few tweaks you can get product out or complete projects on time without burning people out.  Moral will be much better and eveyone will get a good night's sleep.
0843198923|5.0|Okay, let's be real - the Little Miss books are not literary genius, but these books are fun, entertaining and absolutely fun.  I remember having these books as a little girl, and now I read this and others to my daughter for her bedtime stories.  They are fun, engaging, and can be gotten through without much fuss, tongue twisting, or prolonged pointless plot.  Absolutely well worth the small investment in a wonderful book which is sure to engage virtually any child in a journey to Miseryland and how Little Miss Sunshine shares her good cheer and turns the frown upside down.
B006M4F67A|3.0|Wish it would have come with instructions on how to play Majong!  I have never played before, and there were no directions!
B000O19EWK|1.0|The Amazing Spiderman film is much more enjoyable.  This movie lacked in special effects and the acting is terrible.  It's like it was trying to be set in the 50's instead of made in 2002.
B001O7JHSE|5.0|This movie shows that anyone can change their ways, but your actions and what you do, does not affect just you but your friends and family as well.
0843198907|5.0|And, through this book we learn about the support of friends and the creativity of those who care about us.  The Little Miss (and Mr.) books are as wonderful as I remember them from my childhood.  I love being able to share these books with my daughter.  These books are just right for bedtime stories.  When you need to speed read - they accommodate that, and when you have the time to really get into character, the story lines and characters support you dramatic expression.  Too much fun.  The story line on this book is cute and just downright fun, like almost all these books.  Enjoyable, worthwhile and definitely a fantastic addition to our family story collection.
B009AJDDQU|5.0|HI,<br /><br />Everything on tv is soap opera, pretend investigators, cops & secret agent jerks. Yes, I'll watch some but I just don't have anything else to do (can't read & play video/app games all the time?). So when good movies make me smile, laugh or frown, it's a treat! I agree with most about the complaints BUT all that scenic beauty, special effects, the so numerous plot twists possibilities while watching (is this planet (lv-223 or lv-423?), what is the true connection between this and the &#34;Alien&#34; movie, on & on?<br /><br />Now we have this woman & a very devious robot (of course, he doesn't think he is (I'm another life form?)), a lot of possibilities there? Out to face these most terrifying &#34;Engineers&#34; by themselves (boy, I think all of us would like to see that script?). Nevermind that scary squid, the new baby aliens & not forgetting the &#34;Predator, their most hated enemy&#34; is somehow involved in this great saga, yes!<br /><br />-------------<br />-------------
B004XJRQUQ|5.0|best book i have ever read because it is so suspenseful and i love this book and it is awesome XD
B001R4KQDE|5.0|This movie had not only a great movie, but was visual great as well. They go through mutliple stories with multiple characters all intertwining together. If you want to watch a great action film this is it.
B004J4WNL2|5.0|This book helped me understand myself, and confirmed my gut feelings about &#34;Group Think&#34;, noisy classrooms full of group work and many other modern trends. Let's get back to developing Character instead of Personality! I loved the book, although I'm afraid only an introvert would read it all--an extrovert is probably too busy socializing. I really hope the ideas will be presented to teachers and managers.
145210655X|4.0|The book is short but wonderful. It has a lot of reference to Star Wars moments that the fans would love and many parents would feel identified by the situations that Luke and Vader lives.
B009HUB40Y|5.0|This is nice very adicting. Like how i have friends that play this to. Wish it had more like it.
B002ZG981E|5.0|Like most people I had no clue what happened when I first watched this movie. So I bought it so I could watch it again. Still cannot figure it out, but it is a great movie, so enjoy.
B007BVOEPI|5.0|This show had me hooked after about 2 episodes. Loved it. Very similar to Vikings on the History channel, if you enjoy that show.
B00AZMFK3K|5.0|Set phasers to excellence!<br /><br />Based on the sloppy, cartoonish writing of 2009's Star Trek, I was ready and set to hate its sequel. Writers Alex Kurtzman and Roberto Orci have a reputation for lazy, nonsensical writing (see any of the Transformers films, especially 2 and 3) that I feared would permeate my favorite fictional universe, further watering down the intellectual themes that make Star Trek such a captivating series. However, this time out the writers turned out a strong script which, though not without some problems, is the foundation for J.J. Abrams' beautiful, highly entertaining and resonant film.<br /><br />Like its predecessor, Star Trek Into Darkness follows the adventures of Captain Kirk (Chris Pine), Spock (Zachary Quinto), Uhura (Zoe Saldana), and Dr. \\"Bones\\" McCoy (Karl Urban). Scotty (Simon Pegg), Checkov (Anton Yelchin) and Sulu (John Cho) are also along for the ride, along with new science officer Carol Marcus (Alice Eve).<br /><br />The actors have all grown into their roles, with Quinto and Pegg being the standouts this time. Quinto's Spock is reminiscent of Leonard Nimoy's performance without being a copy, and Pegg channels James Doohan to the character's credit. I did not buy these actors in their roles last time, but this film nicely remedies that problem. Alice Eve's Marcus isn't given much to do, but she's fine in the role she plays.<br /><br />The solid performances are given amidst solid writing. Even though this film is more action-packed than the last one, it slows down to explore and develop the characters with greater care than was taken last time. Here, the writers dispense the comic-book origin story formula in favor of creating characters that grow into the complex, adult versions of themselves that longtime fans are familiar with.<br /><br />Following a mission gone wrong in which Kirk has to choose whether to follow Starfleet's cardinal rule of noninterference at the expense of his best friend's life, Kirk loses commandof the Enterprise, leaving him to grapple with his rashness and rule breaking. Words exchanged between Admiral Pike (Bruce Greenwood) and Kirk about Kirk not being ready for command tell the audience that the writers and director are engaging with their rather absurd decision to promote Kirk entirely out of the lower ranks before he learned the necessary lessons that those positions teach.<br /><br />Meanwhile, Spock continues to struggle with balancing logic against emotion and knowing when to use which as a tool and weapon. His relationship with Uhura is on track, gets tested a little, but it seems bigger developments might be saved for the next film.<br /><br />A terrorist attack against Starfleet--a chilling, quiet moment in an otherwise loud film full of music in almost every scene--reunites the crew under Kirk's command and sends them in pursuit of John Harrison (Benedict Cumberbatch). As other reviewers have said, when Cumberbatch speaks, you listen. His Harrison is a clever villain with thoughtful motivations, making him stand out against Eric Bana's boisterous, sort-of-silly Nero. Cumberbatch's gravitas convinces Kirk--and the audience--that dark things are happening in Starfleet.<br /><br />Starfleet's darker elements stand out and resonate. Fearing another catastrophe following the destruction of Vulcan and near destruction of Earth in the prior film, portions of Starfleet have militarized. New weapons are developed, prompting Scotty to ask whether Starfleet is still an organization of explorers like it's meant to be. The writers cleverly pull together a number of elements from all five Star Trek series to develop the organization and create an atmosphere highly relevant to present day America. As we watch the flagship of a democracy modeled on the United States embark on a journey to kill one of its citizens with the equivalent of a drone strike, we contend with the morality of our own real-world policies. The parallel is a little too obvious at times,but is developed in a thoughtful way that does not overwhelm.<br /><br />Still, the movie is not perfect. Perhaps in preparation to helm Star Wars, Abrams treats warp-drive like hyperspace, ignoring distances between planets in favor of advancing to the next action scene. Starfleet is portrayed as an insular organization, having no contact with the civilian government. I would have liked to see the Federation president's take on the increased militarization and drone strikes. Also absent is any civilian reaction to Starfleet's failure to save Vulcan, the terrorist attack it suffers, or its increased military production. However, these absent elements do lay a good foundation for a new TV series, should CBS decide to take that route.<br /><br /> The worst moment in the film comes close the beginning, when we see a Starfleet officer agree to carry out the terrorist attack at Harrison's behest in exchange for Harrison's genetic sequence, which can save the life of the officer's ill daughter. This moment is meant to humanize and connect the audience to the terrorist, but the choice to use a dark-skinned London man who appears to be of Indian or Pakistani descent is obvious and at least mildly offensive. I can think of no reason the terrorist isn't a white man other than to more easily make the audience think of the dark-skinned man as some sort of \\"other,\\" especially as Americans typically associate terrorists with dark-skinned Muslim men.<br /><br />Despite some missteps and missed opportunities, Star Trek Into Darkness is a great film. It has a strong story, develops three-dimensional and believable characters, and creates a beautiful futuristic, lived-in world. J.J. Abrams creates the right mix of character moments and action, and even the lens flares don't seem as distracting. ILM's special effects team outdoes itself. There are several breathtaking shots, one very close the beginning of the film (no, not the volcano, though that one is gorgeous too). I'm not a fanof 3D, but it really stands out here.<br /><br />The bottom line: Star Trek Into Darkness is a smart, breathtaking thrill ride for the casual movie-goer and longtime fan alike, making it 10 warp jumps ahead of its predecessor.

B001GCUO16|3.0|This movie left me wanting more of the story of Wolverine. I am hoping that with the movie they are releasing this year is better than this film.
B008NEMN0K|5.0|It is the perfect gift for  your game playing DVD blu-ray family or friend.<br />IT was a big hit the birthday party.

B009B1UZ7C|5.0|this kid has got game. For a debut, his songwritingmakes him seem 50,not 19. very easy to listen too,with great lyrics,keep it up Jake
B008B68J2G|5.0|If your Monster High loving daughter already has several Monster High dolls, especially if any are from the \\"Scaris: City of Frights\\" line or if she has seen and enjoyed the TV special of that name, here is a gift possibility that represents a nice change of pace from yet another doll or yet another package of clothes for them.<br /><br />What you get (after you've put it all together) is a four large piece, sturdily plastic constructed, MH version of a Parisian petit cafe: rot iron (get used to it; the MH universe is chock full of lethal puns and wordplay) chair, bench, and table with umbrella and eight NON-glow-in-the-dark skull lights, plus rolling cart with removable coffinccino (I warned you) machine, shelf, and seven smaller pieces.  All of the smaller pieces can be stored inside the cart but only when it is lying on its side.  (A closeable door on the cart shelves wood have been a nice addition.)  All the pieces have a nicely done spiderweb or other MH appropriate design.<br /><br />Putting everything together is so easy you can let your daughter do it unsupervised; the included \\"instruction sheet\\" seems a waste of time except for the parts list.  However, unpacking it is a major chore best conducted out of tender earshot for those inclined to accidentally increase their children's vocabulary under stress, and if you do it carefully enough, you can save the colorful box display scene as a play backdrop should your daughter so desire.<br /><br />Fun and durability shouldn't be in much dispute, but you might be wondering about educational value.  I submit this toy is educational if only in the area of puns and clever wordplay; I counted at least eleven.  Of course whether you WANT your daughter to learn about making puns is another matter; personally, I prefer to fight fire with fire, bad pun with worse pun,...<br /><br />until we are both asked to leave.<br /><br />Note: No dolls are included; the set provides seating for three MH dolls.
B004LWZW4C|5.0|Not everyone liked this movie, but I really did. I liked how they have showed some of the X-men/mutants you do not get to hear about like Azazel, and want to see the story between him and Mystique to get to Nightcrawler.
B004LOMB2Q|5.0|I Love this app! For someone as scatter brained as ME this app has proven to be a wonderful tool! Free,  generous<br />And very safe! Try it and see.
B00AB7HESI|5.0|it it a really fun game and whatever you write will come to life. it wont work for anything perverted or trade marked but it is still a fun game! the bad side is that a lot of stuff is needed to be bought. you need to buy a world, avitars, and other stuff.
B009ZQC7MY|3.0|What began as a realistic, more or less, view of the pre world war one upper class England, has become a treacly soap opera.  Watching, I keep thinking, Cue the violins.  And adding Shirley McClain was a mistake (obviously done for ratings).
B00007BHOE|5.0|This is one of the best Live concert dvds you can get. I have seen Slipknot live and they always bring it.
B00881PTRC|4.0|Ultimate hangman is so fun it has brought back many fond memories of study hall! Get it and see for yourself! The graphics are entertainment in itself!
B007HO392S|5.0|carrie Underwood has been a favorite since her victory on American Idol.  Her live concerts are ones not to miss.  This CD brings her into our life once again.
B00CEB5QU2|5.0|I have tried several Wi-Fi streamers from Seagate, Kingston, Adata etc. and this seams to be the best option so far.  Since I have a lot of 64 GB Micro-SD cards with different media files the MobileLite works best for me.  Kingston has a very good IOS app that also allows you to bridge an internet connection to every device that streams to the MobileLite.  The MobileLite is about the size of an iPhone 5 and weighs under 4 oz..  Nice to also have a backup battery to charge the iPhone if needed.
B002ZG99CM|4.0|This movie was good, but not near as good as the original. That does not mean that this is not a bad movie. I think Jackie Chan was a great choice, Jaden Smith? Idk about him, but it could be worse.
B006M4F67A|5.0|We have played this on the computer and love having it on the kindle fire.  It is wonderful to be able to play while traveling.  Helps the time go by.
B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|Just love the show. Always been a fan of Masterpiece Series and again they hit the mark! You won't be disappointed.

B000UR9QGW|5.0|Yes I know the movie is a lot like the first one, but this movie was fantastic. I love the claymation in this movie, it is something you do not see in many movies or most likely will see never again.
B001XUT6AG|5.0|Whole movie played without a &#34;freeze.&#34;  Original cast with Michael Dorn from &#34;generations&#34; thrown in in a prequel part as a lawyer.
B000091YZZ|4.0|The album and cover were in fantastic shape as promised. I bought it for a gift and the person loved it.<br />Great Purchase
B000000OU0|5.0|The new tracks are just as good as their proven hits. Get Over It has been one of my favorites.
B0051CSI0G|5.0|When I bought this film I had no idea what to expect. It was a movie that I had not heard of but it looked and sounded good and was not to expensive. I was right to pick this up. It takes the post apocalyptic worlds from zombie movies and then replaces the zombies with vampires. Great movie though. Think of a serious zombieland but with vampires instead of zombies.
B0094K1JPC|5.0|A few bad words, but mostly PG.  Harrison is always good in any part. Rachel's part was a stretch.  Hard to believe her responsibility.
B00C7TAF3Y|5.0|This is the best game on kindle hands down. Cannot wait for the next update. Don't hesitate, buy this game now.
B00CDT41RY|5.0|Excellent story with an incredible cast. Sucks you in and spots you out bloodied but satisfied! You will want the bad guys to get theirs, and you will not be disappointed!
B000Q6GX5Y|5.0|I remember when this movie came out. I did not know how great it would be. Well it was awesome, and the action/fight scenes in this movie are breathtaking. This movie showed some more of Frank Miller's work.
B0071XO8RA|5.0|But when I did it was great.  Totally enjoyed this and I am not much of a reader-for-pleasure.  Thanks, Mr. Howey.
B000001FKG|5.0|Works like new. In great condition. And on top of that, Bon Jovi is just amazing :D Ive been jamming out since it got here.
B000SZH7RQ|5.0|what can I say John Lee Hooker was my introduction to the blues so he holds a special place with me. This album does not disappoint the tracks with canned heat are good heck the whole album is good just do yourself a favor and pick this one up and enjoy
B00164GDA0|5.0|This has to be one of my favorite movies based on a Stephen King book. A great coming of age tale of kids going on a adventure to find a body and become what they think will make them heroes. It also stars River Phoenix who went far before his time.
0307352153|5.0|This book is a real breakthrough for introverts to understand that they are ok and, in fact, can tap their inner, quiet strength for personal growth and success in their fields of endeavor. She uses real world experiences to demonstrate and argue her points with great conviction. Takes the concept of &#34;I'm ok, you're ok&#34; to a whole new level. A tour de force.
B0027MJU00|5.0|This is a very interesting book. I like how they keep you in suspense until the very end. Very enticing.
B008Z9YGEE|5.0|A pleasant surprise, though, I enjoyed the plot and thought the actors did a good job. I am anxious for the next Hunger Games movie.
B002ZG99A4|4.0|Or at least they made it seem like it was the manliest movie ever made when it came out. Overall all if you like action movies, and you like at least half of the people in the movie if not more buy it.
B0089EHWQE|4.0|This is a good read about a topic that will probably come in for increased attention as money for medical care becomes scarcer.  I already know where I stand on this subject, so for me it was confirmation.  Still, the characters evoke empathy, and I loved how the main character, a young woman, grew in breadth throughout the book.  I recommend this book for anyone interested in a good story, competently written.
B0013TXA5Y|4.0|Very interesting and unique, the way I see this story is a mix of religion and divination, and like Harry Potter, the Twilight saga, and the Hunger Games Trilogy there is a Love triangle in it.  But otherwise, it's a good story.
B003Y5H556|5.0|At first I was kind of misled by the title but \\"Lil\\" was missing.  I rented the Blu Ray and I was not disappointed. I had to view it again  before returning it!  Filled with fast action and you have to watch it very carefully.  Had some great effects too!  Amanda Seyfried is at her best in this one of a kind movie.  Yes, they sneak in the fairy tale portion but it is only a minute, if that.  Since it takes place during medieval times, makes me wonder if that fairy tale was told back then.<br />A wolf that terrorizes a small village and the people go after it, kill it, only to find others and cannot figure out where all these wolves are coming from and why they are attacking them.  This comes together in the middle of the movie and builds from there.  I enjoyed this movie!
B001RIY4WE|4.0|This movie has always been good. It looks even better on blu-ray and for the price you cannot go wrong.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|Fun game.the only thing I would change is that the app wont work on my phone.other than that its a great app.
B00A3NQNUU|5.0|This is one of the most favorite games the kids play. They cannot wait to get back to it. Very entertaining.to build your own village.
B006LSZECO|4.0|A page turner. Flynn keeps you guessing and hits you with quite the surprise ending. Psychologically intriguing and very well crafted.
B0050PYNO4|5.0|This was a really funny movie. Seth Rogan hits the head on the nail with playing the foul mouthed alien named Paul. Could of gone with a little less anti-christian approach but it really did not bother me too much.
B00AEBB9RS|4.0|Good moive, cheesy plot, and a lot of sex scenes from one of my favorite female actors of all time (when it comes to seedy suspense/thrillers). Overall, if you like any of Sharon Stone's previous work prior to this film, you know what to expect.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|This is another game that the kids like because it is action packed -on going and challenging. A real favorite.
B007UQ5Z1G|5.0|My favorite band of all time, always and forever. Love their music and each CD only gets better and better to me as this groups grows.
B002WY65W4|4.0|Great zombie film. It has horror, comedy, and lots of blood and guts, what more can you ask for? I love how they can never find any twinkies. That just cracks me up.
B0013FSXT6|3.0|Weird but interesting film... a ton of nudity and Nichole Kidman made it descent...that's about all I have to say about Eyes Wide Shut.
B0069G5Z9K|5.0|This game is good for all ages, action packed, captivating fun, and challenging , a great game, very entertaining. Love it
B00A7ZWUJC|3.0|Some good hits on here but the rest is not really my cup of tea. I do enjoy her music over all.
B0011E9LBI|4.0|I remember watching this a little kid a loving it, and I still love it when I watch it today. This movie is great and has Will Smith at his best, I love the funny Will Smith not the serious Will Smith.
B009NY43NY|1.0|Ok I have been following this series since the beginning and I was just totally disappointed in the finale. I know you can't please everyone, but this was not her best work even leaving out that I wasn't happy about the ending. It felt like she was trying to cram 1,000 loose ends into this that didn't all want to fit. It has been stated ad nauseum, but this was terrible!! I have loved Sookie for years (I even named my cat after her) and I would have thrown this in the fireplace if it was the actual book and not on the Kindle. As it is, I will delete it so I don't have to see the title anymore. I have never ever been this disgusted by a book ever. I did expect a tragic ending, since poor Sookie has been through the ringer, but not a pathetic and lame \\"I don't know what to do here\\".<br /><br />A. You do not introduce several new people in the last installment. We cannot possibly get to know them enough to like them or not by the end.<br />B. You do not put Sookie with someone who has been like her brother for ten freaking years worth of books.<br />C. You do not say \\"screw you\\" to your fans (who put tons of cash in your pocket) by giving us a sloppy, thrown together mess to live with.<br />D. You do not contradict yourself and change things that have been established for years!<br /><br />All in all I hope the show can take the bad taste out of my mouth because this was a disgrace. I had hoped she would put her all into this as she was leaving us with this forever, but NOPE. Don't waste your money or your time like the rest of us did.
0385349947|5.0|Sheryl Sandberg has written a wonderful book for any woman who wants to go further and think forward.  As a woman who was in the \\"pipeline\\" with a large, well-known corporation, they were already thinking about putting women in the leadership roles they earned and were qualified for.  Sheryl wants women to wake up to their potential and schools, corporations and the halls of government to push toward equality.<br /><br />She has written a self-proclaimed \\"feminist manifesto\\" but it isn't written with that much as such ... just enough to rouse the fairer gender into taking some steps toward leadership, ownership and dissatisfaction with the status quo.<br /><br />The book is a conversation that led to action and is paired wonderfully with the \\"Lean In\\" community.  A place where women (and men) of all ages can start the conversation and continue to discuss issues around leadership and equality.
B009FB3XTA|5.0|I love the mix of tracks on all the Twilight CDs. There are some talented not so well known artists on each CD. I love listening to these songs! =)
B0011UF792|5.0|Can Kevin Smith make a bad move...cough cough Jersey Boy. But besides that everything is gold. I mean this movie has a poop monster for crying out loud.
1416550550|5.0|Of all the books we have read for book group this year, this one was by far my favorite.  Intriguing story, great characters and I love the fairy tales mixed in with the book.
193700788X|3.0|I've known for the last several books (or maybe even after the first several books) that there's only so much that can be done with this story line.  I also sense the HBO version is also close to the end of its run because the writers don't know where to go with the alternate story lines and/or the characters.  I used to care about these characters and find myself wondering if Harris has \\"crowdsourced\\" the writing of the last few books.  I guess the money has been made and the inspiration lost along the way.  I guess I secretly hoped there was some masterful storytelling that would be wrapped up with this book.  These characters were so original and fresh in the beginning-they deserved better.
B005HV6Y84|5.0|I love the mix of tracks on all the Twilight CDs. There are some talented not so well known artists on each CD. I love listening to these songs! =)
B001JNNDEW|5.0|This movie is great, working in an office this movie really makes me laugh more than some. And for the steal of the price I got I had to add this to my collection.
B004J4WLB4|4.0|Great story!  Quick, easy read with very original storyline.  The connection to flowers made the story all that much more interesting. Good ending.
B0099Y2MYK|5.0|I can't wait for next season.  We had a 3 season marathon going and now miss the Abbey so much!
B00AMBLDEE|3.0|It was still an ok movie but disappointed from what I expected I guess. I love Jeremy Renner and the Bourne series but this was a let down - glad I rented and didn't buy.
B004LWZW4W|4.0|I thought this movie was very good. How they used CGI and the guy that was Golem in LOTR to be the ape was amazing. Good movie looking forward to the next one, sad to see that Franco will not be in it though.
B00005JL96|4.0|This was one of my daughters favorite moves when she was about 3.  I think the movie was fun (but not great) however she loved the sound track and now loves Elvis music, go figure.
B008EKOIN8|4.0|like all of Michael Pollan's books, this one is well researched and yet still extremely readable. I leaned a few new kitchen tricks, though I would have loved one or two exact recipes, especially for the slow art of braising.
B00APUYWYA|5.0|yes it was predictable but I loved it! Feel good movie that made me laugh. I wasn't expecting much honestly but ended up loving it
B004SIP9GK|5.0|This movie is one of my favorite movies, for me Shorty makes this movie. He is one of the funnier characters of the movie, I do not know how many times I have watched online best of shorty clips and I die laughing.
B00C7TAF3Y|5.0|between the music and sound effects, it is quite suspenseful. graphics are vivid. I am just<br />hoping it doesn't veer off into something demonic.
B00APUYN0I|2.0|Heard Rebel Wilson was really good in the movie and was looking forward to a great comedy.  We found the movie boring and immature.  A disappointment.
0307352153|5.0|For me, it's clear that I think highly of a book when I start talking about it with everyone I encounter, even before I'm finished. Such was the case with Quiet: The Power of Introverts in a World that Can't Stop Talking by Susan Cain.<br /><br />Sure, it's a book about introverts, as the title suggests, but there is so much more to it than that. It's obvious that, as an introvert, Susan cares about introverts. She writes so that they will know themselves better, respond better to their surroundings and know how to articulate their personalities and needs.<br /><br />I did not expect the generous helping of balance which I found in these pages. She doesn't only care about extroverts in as far as they grow to appreciate introverts, she cares about them because they are people, and because there is a reason why both introverts and extroverts walk the earth. There is a beautiful tribute to her grandfather in the back of the book, a minister when he was alive, and I wonder if she, like me, believes that God knew what He was doing when He created people to be different and still have to work together.<br /><br />Either way, this book brims with truth and productivity. As an introvert, I realized that our culture has told me thousands of things about myself that are wrong, for as long as I can remember. Although I consider myself to be a fairly well-rounded person, and even a confident person most of the time, I was surprisingly relieved to hear descriptions of introverts that were positive, varied (all introverts are not alike, just as all extroverts are not alike) and most of all, presented as an option that is all right.<br /><br />There were several times that I found myself sighing with relief. Oh, wow, maybe that's how I was created to be.<br /><br />For quick contrast, I give you another example from my childhood: The Birth Order Book. After I read it, I spent hours crying because I was a perfectionist and would never ever be able to change ever and what a horrible, terrible thing it is to be a perfectionist.<br /><br />That book made me feel hopeless, powerless, this book made me feel like I was a great idea that God had.<br /><br />For example, here is a quote which relates to the extrovert ideal so prevalent in our culture: that extroverts are the way everyone should be.<br /><br />\\"We tend to think of coolness as a pose that you strike with a pair of sunglasses, a nonchalant attitude, and drink in hand. But maybe we didn't choose these social accessories at random. Maybe we've adopted dark glasses, relaxed body language and alcohol as signifiers precisely because they camouflage signs of a nervous system on overdrive...When you go to a football game and someone offers you a beer, says the personality psychologist Brian Little, 'they're really saying hi, have a glass of extroversion.'\\"<br /><br />Susan spent five years researching the material for this book. The care that she put into her research is evident in every word. I do not often feel that way about a book, so I thought that I would tell you.<br /><br />In general, I find that I do not write in books. I remember when I found out that C.S. Lewis would scribble all over his library and make copious notes in the back. It shocked me. Little by little, I've underlined a bit here and there. This book compelled me to pick up my pen and underline line after line.<br /><br />Whether you are an introvert, or an extrovert who loves one, parents one or works with one (even if you don't know it yet, introverts can be sneaky) I think that you should read this book. Not only will you understand yourself better, no matter where you fall on this continuum, but I would venture to say that if we took some of what is here and allowed it to change how we relate to people and give them grace, we would revolutionize relationships of all kinds.<br /><br />I received this book for free from WaterBrook Multnomah Publishing Group for this review.
B003FXXNBW|5.0|This movie was action packed with fights from beginning to end. The fight scenes were choreographed very well too. This is one of the ony fighting movies like this that I could get my friend to watch that he actually to watch.
B003XF1XOQ|2.0|Good book had an unexpected ending I would recommend it.  It was sad all of the people that were lost and killed.

B003TT2X72|4.0|got this movie on a great deal, if you have not seen this movie. Welcome how was '99, just kidding but if you have not seen the LOTR series watch it, you will enjoy it.
B001NKI60W|5.0|I love the movie. The cast is well picked and the singing is fun and tells the story. Highly recommend it
B0064X7FVE|4.0|so glad its not the android updated version of the app, this one is much easier to use and has way more information than the updated version
B00BEZTMFY|5.0|I have all the lords of the ring movies so it was a great collection to my movies thank you
1593072937|4.0|This a very good graphic novel I think I am just not a big graphic novel person. I read most of it and was just not as into it as I wanted to be. I am taking nothing away from the story or Frank Miller. I think I am more of a wait for the graphic novel to turn into a movie than to read it. I feel like when I read I want to read a book not a comic. So I found out graphic novels were not for me, that does not mean this is bad by any means though.
0385742886|3.0|Rather than reading the Maze Runner Trilogy first, I decided to pick up this prequel. First of all, I do not see much of a tie in with this book and Maze runner outside of the prologue and epilogue. In all honesty this book seemed to be a lot of zombies, fight, fight, fight. The Kill Order is set in a post-apocalyptic/sun flare sort of society. Most of humanity has been wiped out and are living in conditions of squalor. We're introduced to that both in present time (a few years after the sun flare events) and by dreams of Mark to the past.<br /><br />I got caught up in the story of our main protagonist Mark, however, I really found the story quite repetitive. It seemed like every other chapter we had to have a zombie/maniacal kill mandate. I would have rather seen more plot development than zombie attacks. Sometimes too much action takes away from a good story.<br /><br />Without going into too much more details, I almost see this book as standalone, it does not wrap up any lose ends that I've seen so far, in fact, it almost creates more questions. I'd like to see more done with this in the future, I think it's necessary to continue the story started in the Kill Order which hopefully should make tie-ins to mazerunner more effective.<br /><br />For this reason, from the jumping around, too-frequent zombie attacks, and an overall repetitive plot, I give the kill order 3/5 stars. Hopefully more will be done to wrap the Maze Runner series into a tight package with a pretty bow.
0802473156|5.0|We love the whole series of the 5 Love Languages books in our house! Great read and empowers each person that takes the time on each of these books!
0765325950|4.0|Its been more than 20 years since I read the first in this series. A part of me is sad that I have to say goodbye to my old friends (of which there are many). I hear complaints from people about the \\"Game of Thrones\\" series that there are so many characters that its hard to keep track. Well, I've got to tell those folks that the number of characters in WOT dwarfs the GOT by a mile. Sanderson does a great job bringing this unwieldy saga to a satisfying conclusion. It wasn't easy but I give him high marks for tying up all of the loose ends. May the Dragon ride again on the winds of time!
B004EPZ07U|4.0|I liked this movie. I thought Renolds did a good job as the Green Lantern, and I hope they do another film as well.
B00AESN8XY|4.0|I like it. it is incredibly strategic and requires more brains than most games. I do think that the disease names had more letters in them
B00CDT41RY|5.0|...The story involves multiple layers of myth; is true to the history and hideous behaviors of the racist south; is wonderfully written with both humor and deep intensity; and is ultimately very redeeming. All performances are beyond marvelous. Waltz and Jackson did such fine jobs I didn't initially recognize them. The filmmaking is fantastic as usual for the director: Bravo Tarantino and cast!
B0042J6VUS|1.0|I was disappointed with this product. The description said \\"iPhone, iPod or other cellphone.\\" I have an Android phone, and it does not fit. The description is misleading.
B003IY48PS|5.0|such a great movie. Yes I know it is low budget and kind of cheezy. But this movie helped reinvent scary movies and showed that you did not have to have a big budget to have a great movie.
B008Y5OW20|5.0|I'm a huge fan of music from the 30's-50's ... Jeff Lynne handles the task of reproducing these songs with panache an tender affection.
B00BHMETKC|3.0|Argo is  well told, well acted and engaging, though its production value falls solidly within the traditional Hollywood status quo, especially as compared to its competitors at the Oscars this year. The movie, however, is more than worth a view. The story is historically important and gives us a stark reminder of the earliest roots of the troubling religious, political and business conflicts that led up to the wars we are dealing with today.
B0070Y46UY|4.0|It is an interesting premise and I am still inquiring within myself, does the Tiger represent the dark side of me?  It is amazing how a young person can survive the ordeal of losing his family and being on a boat for 277 days with a Tiger and survive that.  It shows how all of us have strengths within ourselves that we are unaware until we call upon them.
B0050PYNOY|5.0|This movie was dogged by reviewers, and even James Franco himself. But this is one of those so bad/stupid it is good movies, and it really bad more stupid in my mind.
B008OJ291W|5.0|It's hard to believe these are complete remakes. The BEST remake album by any artist in rock history. Jeff's a genius.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|This book is one of the best I've read in a while. It kept me turning the page and wanting to know what was coming next.
B002JIEYLW|4.0|This was an amazing Sabs release & DEFINITELY also deserves a reissue with a bonus disc of demos!! C'mon-OPEN UP THOSE WB VAULTS & LET 'EM OUT!
B004EPZ06Q|3.0|No this movie was not as good as the first, how many are get over it. This movie yes it is like the first movie yes. In a completely different location what did you expect from a movie call The Hangover PartII? To be about guys going camping? Come on now
B00BHXUC4S|5.0|Incredible album from a particularly prolific period in Jeff Lynne's career. It would be great to have a few more rereleases from this period (like Julianna Raye's &#34;Something Peculiar&#34; album ... it's like E.L.O. with a female vocalist.)
B000JBWWRY|5.0|kid loves it.  glad to find this available on amazon.  of course, just about anything is.  :)  collecting the disney classics for my 3 y/o, so very happy to find this one at a reasonable price.  we watched it no less than 3 times the day it came.  Packaging fine, discs fine, fast ship.  Thank you!
B00C7TAF3Y|5.0|This game is so much fun. I did not want it to end. Challenging but not too hard. Can't wait for them to make more rooms!!
B00198X0VS|3.0|It is not as good as the first movie, but it is still good. Made me laugh and was a decent storyline and original.
B000IFSDZQ|5.0|It's hard to say he's overlooked because he has been incredibly successful. It's just sad most Americans only think of his amazing string of chart-topping hits. His writing ability puts him in the league with other geniuses like Jeff Lynne.
B008ZOHCKE|1.0|UPDATE on 09/05/13:<br /><br />Ok....I still think this app has great potential....but it SERIOUSLY needs an UNDO button!!!!!  Too many times now I have wiped out a whole page full of information accidently when I have tried to paste new information onto a page!!!!!  I don't understand how it happens because I NEVER notice it showing everything highlighted before I hit the PASTE button.  I even recently had it happen when the page was supposed to have been \\"write-protected\\"!!!!!  So, maybe that should be looked into also. It is very frustrating because I have lost information that I had wanted to keep - otherwise, why would I have bothered making notes in the Notebook?????  I am lowering my Star rating from 3 to 1.  If the app is fixed and updated on my tablet, I will up the stars back probably to a 4 or 5 star rating.  Although the 5 star rating might have to wait until they make the write-protect feature better!<br /><br />PREVIOUSLY on May 15, 2013:<br /><br />I really like this app a lot!  I like that you can create separate notebooks for different things.  I can easily go back to the \\"bookshelf\\" to switch to a different notebook.  I like that you can save individual pages as well as a whole notebook to a PDF file.<br /><br />I like that you can even \\"write protect\\" the notebooks. However, I think it would be better if I could write protect certain pages and still be able to add new pages or edit pages that I have previously created without having to remove the write protection off of all the pages.  Also, it would be nice if I could add a password to the write protect feature, so someone else can't edit pages without my password.  Or so I don't accidentally remove the write protect - these touch screens can be so sensitive and small for such big hands!<br /><br />The other thing that this app (and other note type apps I've tried) needs is an UNDO feature!!!!!!!  It is so frustrating to lose a whole page (or even a part of a page) of information because I accidentally pasted something onto the page while it was somehow highlighted in error.  That happened to me tonight!  Apparently, when I had scrolled back down to the bottom of the page, it must have gotten highlighted because, when I pasted something at the bottom of the page, everything else disappeared!  SIGH!  Also, sometimes when I paste things on the page, the slightest movement causes the cursor to be in the wrong place, so the pasted information winds up in the middle of something else.  Oh how I long for an UNDO button at those times!!!

B004I1K2NW|5.0|This is not only one of Peter Jackson' s best films, but I also think it is one of Michael J. Fox's career. This is a must watch for any Michael J. Fox fan.
B005PK57IK|5.0|Great season, the Good Wife along with the courtroom drama is very addictive. I could not stop watching it. I am a Good Wife Addict. I watch the whole season non-stop. Thanks Amazon for another great show. It left me wanting more.
1449325947|5.0|I own a business with an e-commerce website that was designed 5 years ago by a guy that was comfortable with using tables to layout websites instead of CSS. Not knowing any better and needing an affordable solution, we went with it.  Fast forward 5 years and the business continues to grow, but the website looks really dated.  Time for a makeover.<br />I purchased this book to guide my rebuild of the e-commerce site.  It has provided excellent guidance.  I am not a web designer, but I do possess strong logic skills.  With a little trial and error combined with persistence, the website is on its way to being updated.  The book is clear in its instructions and the tutorials are very helpful in making you walk through the steps in creating the layout with CSS.  I would recommend this book.
B00756GRUE|5.0|I selected this Seiko after looking at so many watches online and in person that my head was starting to swim. You can read the other reviews for all the details, but I selected this watch because it had the few features that I wanted - Solar powered, chronograph, decent water Resistance, and good size - at a price point that was very attractive. I found the same model at Costco for a just a dollar or so more, but would've had to pay sales tax.<br /><br />The watch functions well, the face is easy to read (time, date, and stopwatch), and it looks nice. The only problem I ran into was having it re-sized to fit my wrist. The jeweler was not familiar withe Seiko pin and collar mechanism, and did not put the collars back on when they removed the links. I took it back, explained the issue to them, and a more knowledgeable employee fixed it for me. This seems to be a common problem on Seiko's so make sure the jeweler knows what they are doing.<br /><br />Otherwise, I'm very happy with this purchase, and think that I received a good watch at a great price.
B001TOD9VI|5.0|This movie was great, being a big wrestling fan as a kid, of course I checked this movie out. I was not dissapointed what a great drama about an aging wrestler trying to piece back the life that he left out on a long time ago.
B008JGSM6G|4.0|This is a fun app. I have been really challenged by the higher levels and have gone back to try and try again until able to solve. I recommend for all puzzle lovers.

0375850864|5.0|Miranda and her best friend Sal live in the same apartment building and spend most of their time together, exploring their neighborhood and walking to and from school together. When an older boy punches Sal  for no discernible reason, Sal stops talking to Miranda and she feels lonelier than ever. As she slowly starts to make new friends, she begins receiving mysterious notes from a stranger that hint at tragedy awaiting Sal...and only Miranda has the power to prevent it.<br /><br />Miranda's narration in When You Reach Me is magnetic and so engaging. Stead does a fantastic job at portraying New York City of 1979, populated with many colorful and diverse characters who all play their own part, big or small, in the mystery that unfolds. When Sal severs all contact with Miranda, Miranda is reluctant to reach out to new people, but as she slowly makes new friends and begins receiving her mysterious notes, she realizes the importance of contact and the effects of small acts of kindness. All of these lessons build up to a tense climax that gives Miranda a new perspective that allows her to see reality and piece together the clues to an impossible answer she has been pondering (and avoiding) for months. This fantastic book is indeed an homage to Madeleine L'Engle's A Wrinkle in Time, and sure to be equally popular among adults and younger readers.<br /><br />Cover Comments: This cover is wonderful in its simplicity. I love how many of the objects are important clues in the novel, and the way that they are laid out on a city grid is awesome.
B00003CXB4|4.0|I bought this as a present for my neices. They loved this, but I am not really suprised I think every kid has loved this film when they were younger.
B004ZMWUCU|4.0|When I started this book I did not think I was going to like it, but once I got into it I just could not put it down.
B00992CF6W|5.0|I would like to know when the new update is coming also hate squids love BUTTER  skythekidRS . The app is worth the money it is only $7.00 ,and the computer version is $26.00 ,or $27.00 + the downloads.The computer version tops all versions in my opinion ps BUTTER BUTTER BUTTER SKYTHEKIDRS WOO<br />Get booth computer version , and pocket edition  $33.00 or $34.00 if you want to<br />GO BUTTER PS BUTTER is gold
B009OYTOA0|5.0|This show has turned into one of my favorite shows.  The characters are really compelling and detailed.  The story is fantastic.  The finale of the first season had me at the edge of my seat.  I can't wait until October to start getting more episodes.
B003F3NEBG|1.0|I bought this and returned it. It looked grainey on my screen. I figured I didn't pay extra for a crappier quality then regular DVD. Amazon was awesome with returning it which I was grateful for since I bought it from a vendor.
B00A77II0U|1.0|I have played many of these games, i bought this one with amazon coins', i have tried to download it 4x now and it wont happen, im very disappointed, it looks like it would be a fun one,but i will never know
B0028MBKVG|5.0|Fantastic book. Well written and inspiring tale . A blend of mysticism and practical tips for runners. I highly recommend it, not just for athletes.
B006M4F67A|4.0|I like the game, always have. I just wish it turned with the device. I think this is a common complaint and applys to alot of the games out there. But regardless, the game is well done. Thanks for one of my fav time wasters!
B00CHSPB8Y|4.0|its ok but you need space in your image and video storage otherwise I think it is AWSOME EPIC FUN COOL AND EXTREME
B007ZD17XO|5.0|Great game, graphics are awesome.. I recommend it highly<br />Easy game to get lost in, challenging and makes you want to keep playing
B008B9JTLI|5.0|Just love Samuel Jackson in all of his movies.  Jackson is a very actor and can play any part.  He's a good actor I think.
B005FDXT32|5.0|They really did an amazing job remastering this movie the quality is great, not as good as a new movie's blu-ray but it is a classic
B003UBTX6S|5.0|I really like this series, grabs my attention and keeps me engaged.  it is really well-written and a unique subject
B002OSXDAU|5.0|This is one of the foundational books on the subject.  This makes a great companion piece with another book on Freedom (and laughter), Unclogged [...]  Have an enlightened and fun summer!
B004BSFC46|5.0|These cuffs are baby's first &#34;educational&#34; toy. My grandson is three months old, and of course randomly waves his arms. When he happens to wave the lady bug or bumble bee in front of his face, he is delighted! It won't be long before he figures out that he can control those wrists to which these critters are attached. I used a product that was similar 40 years ago with this baby's father, and it does work in that it encourages eye/hand coordination. The grand baby sometimes gnaws on the lady bug so I am thinking I should buy another set. Love the product.
B005VPRDAY|5.0|I partially was satisfied with this product.  There were fewer bricks included than I thought there should be so there was some disappointment.
B002MQYOFW|3.0|I thought it was exiting and adventurous with a hint of romance. I really liked it and look forward to the rest of the series.
B0091REZMW|4.0|Nice game to pass the time. I enjoyed it and hope everyone else does as well. If you like hidden object games and a cute story this is it for you
B000QCS8TW|5.0|Fantastic! The show stays so close to the storyline in the book. So rare to find anymore. Hard to put down!!
B002TQKS14|5.0|Michael Pollan takes us on a fascinating journey through the history, geography, science and ethics of what we eat. The chapters on the monoculture of corn and CAFOs were very disturbing, and, I feel, essential reading for all of us who consume the end results of these industries.<br /><br />I found the hunting and foraging chapters especially interesting, even poetic at times, and I am now determined to learn more about the mysterious mushroom!<br /><br />All in all a book I very highly recommend and am looking forward to starting the next book in my to-read list by this author, 'Cooked'.
B00CKOYVG8|1.0|you have to have a facebook for this app which I think is stupid because most people don't have a facebook I think thc s would be better if you didn't have to have it
B001NLKT60|5.0|The first book was good but man I can not stop reading this one.  I am having a really hard time leaving my Kindle home when I go to work because I want to read this book.  I don't even want to watch my shows on TV.  I just want to read so I can start the last book.  I hope The Girl Who Kick The Hornets Nest is better than this one.  What a great book.
B002BWP49C|4.0|Although I bought this for my daughter on her birthday, I like it because it tickles me to watch her get slobbery over Jacob!
B009UX2YAC|5.0|This game is sooo fun and addicting!!!!! I would play it all day if I had the time! I recommend Subway Surfurs to anyone interested in Temple Run.... It is just like it but even better!
B0067TQQI8|5.0|I bought this product to charge/power devices on the go and it has not disappointed me. It's compact, and charges quickly.
B00BEZTMFY|5.0|my family loves this movie! i bought it for my bf as a just because gift after we went to the movies to see it. they've watched it a dozen times since.
0425263908|3.0|For me this book was just OK. I'm not comparing this to 50 Shades even though I read all 3. I thought the relationship was very fast paced. They were going through so much and they just met. I'm skeptical about buying the 2nd book.<br /><br />****DON'T READ THIS PART IF YOU DON'T WANT TO KNOW ABOUT THE BOOK****<br /><br />Tell me you guys weren't creeped the F out when Gideon had a bedroom in his house for Eva and it looked exactly just like her bedroom in her apartment?!?!?!?! That sounds like something you see on Law and Order SVU.
0385341008|5.0|I was hesitant at first...a book consisting ENTIRELY of letters???????? However, the characters were so real and believable, I hated to see it end! I wish Both authors had lived to see it published. BRAVO!!
B00COGXGNQ|4.0|Love the story board of the relationship. It leads to real life situations and can relate to how things can be handlle.
0812983459|5.0|Amazing book..Harold Fry's journey  reminds us that the best things in life are the simplest; life goes on so fast that we often forget.
B007NG93CK|5.0|The mysteries of death are hidden from us until Tempe's scientific knowledge and persistence reveals the unknown. Her continuing affair with Ryan and worry over Kate make this absorbing crime story so addictive. Hated putting it down at night!
B005KELQEU|5.0|Very compact and will keep my Kindel safe for travelg.ing and will fit into my handbag and so easy to hold in my hand
B00AB7HESI|5.0|it is just as good as the DS  Scribblenauts if not better new items  more stages and is really fun get scribblenauts
B00C7TAF3Y|5.0|This game was amazing. It was difficult but not impossible and made you think about all the possibilities and pay attention to detail. Needless to say it definitely sucked me into the game and sadly before I knew it it was over. But all in all it was definitely a good purchase.
B006LSZECO|5.0|Loved it from page 1! When it is said you cannot put it down...believe it. I carried it with me from room to room in case I had a minute.
1451695195|1.0|This book is not near what is expecting of it. The author talk about himself his family story and struggle. You know a lot of about the down to earth stuff very little about the real EMI and then a very thin explanation on how this is not simply a deep dream.<br /><br />Deceived reader.
B009UX2YAC|4.0|better than temple run 1 or 2 it is fun as you surf the rail road and collect items over all a really fun game
B00AF6MF9I|4.0|the game was quite good it had good graphics and pretty fun gameplay. they dont make you pay for anything to move on all in all fun easy game
B005K17RU0|4.0|This is a great little app for checking the weather. It's fairly accurate and easy to use. The drawbacks of this app are: It won't show % of possibility for moisture (maybe that comes with the paid version), and under the satellite option it only shows the very current picture, not anything that is happening throughout the day, etc, which I could just look outside to determine that! It would be nice to see what they suspect the weather will be for the whole day. Other than that I really like it, especially the real feel temp with the actual temp.
B001BC5HXG|5.0|As a native Californian, I am familiar with the area.  Steinbeck brought the charaters to life and the actors did not disappoint me - they were exactly like he described them in the book.
1416550550|2.0|I'm sorry to say that I -in no way- identify with any of the main characters of this book.  No one is sympathetic, and I've got no patience for a character that suddenly experiences an existential crisis after 20 years of being loved and accepted within a supportive family.<br />There are characters out there in fiction facing real adversity, madness, conspiratorial mysteries, crushing injustice, heartbreaking defeat, and honor-driven agendas of futility.<br />...So...I'm gonna go read about one of them.
B004SBULWE|5.0|You never know how many apps open and run in the background until you get this handy little app. Keeps the open on it's own apps under control.
B008393Q2O|2.0|I got this app from Amazon's Free App of the Day thinking that it could replace my basic note app that I also got for free. I like the plain paper looking one for free over this one and actually removed this from my kindle device.<br /><br />There isn't a lot of space to write your notes but there are big gaps on the sides where nothing is but you have this tiny little cube to write your notes in which makes it hard to see if you are writing something lengthy. It makes no sense.<br /><br />The color coding was an okay feature. But for simple notes all the extra coloring and options stuff is a bit excessive in my opinion.<br /><br />Unless you make detailed notes about EVERYTHING, I wouldn't waste your money, get a free one.
B003ZSJ212|5.0|movies were exactly as I expected,  brand new, but much less cost than in the stores, which is always a great thing.
B004UID2LC|5.0|i think this iis aver great app! i guess its just me! but its pretty amazing!  it works for me fine! i dont know about you guys.
B00BWBHIUG|5.0|Good clean fun! I love playing this game very addicting. I would recommend to anyone wanting a good easy game.
B005S9EK5Y|5.0|I've seen the stage play in numerous cities and was nervous the movie would be a disappointment, but it was simply amazing
B009POCG5Y|5.0|This is an excellent movie.  I would recommend it to anyone especially Clint Eastwood fans.  No violence is also a plus.
B00BEZTMFY|3.0|It ended when It started getting good so now I have to wait for the rest.  Loved the book years ago
B004P8JPS6|4.0|My first Jack Reacher book...fun fast ride.  Reacher is maybe a little too big and burly a character for my taste but I like the way his mind works.  His mind set allows the story to unravel in unexpected ways that feel natural and believable.  Hard to set down in spite of the way justice has it's way.<br />Great escape fiction delivered on all cylinders.
B0046B8GEQ|5.0|Well done animation with believable characters. Laughed out loud more than in any other movie in recent memory. Oscar caliber.
B0072GPPNC|5.0|This is an excellent movie for all.  It is also an inspiring movie which teaches some history on how war has been fought in the past.
B004I2K4E8|5.0|Best performance on DVD as far as I'm concerned.  I have not watched the new movie so that's the only thing I cannot compare it too.
B0093LINVK|5.0|Amazingly small! Wish it had USB 3.0 though : (<br />Very fast!<br />Extremely well built!<br />Don't forget to get a local clover cable as it isn't included!
B0091REZMW|5.0|I have really enjoyed this game and haven't spent one dime on anything I have needed. Patience is a virtue, if you're willing to wait and find the items you need. It also helps to have plenty of friends who can help you.
B005LAIIKI|4.0|This is a really good movie which shows some of the horrors of slavery.  It is a little too bloody for my young grandchildren to watch, but would recommend it to adults.
B000JIN3J8|2.0|Unfortunately, I don't think this particular production measures up to the Keira Knightley/Matthew MacFaydan film or the Colin FIrth/Jennifer Ehrl version.  I particulary don't care for the actor's portrayal of Mr. Darcy or the actor's portrayal of Mr. Collins.
B008Y7N7JW|5.0|i total enjoy this movie, only one word for it is that is Awesome!!!  a must watch movie!!  I would watch it in a heart beat again!!
B009MFKO3M|3.0|I bought this CD after hearing the song on a commercial, it was a catchy song! Listened to it once and thought, kind of trippy. But after a few more rotations I started to sense that there was not a whole lot of depth here. Songs are not particularly complex or deep. Some fancy production and a few catchy hooks, but nothing too special. It is kind of space age Beatles. I heard some Pink Floyd references from others, but I do not hear that at all.
B0017SWPXY|5.0|As one who loves dogs, cars and family drama, this book delivers it all! An easy read through the eyes of dog that gives one a fun way to see life as he sees it. Enzo's story is one I can easily recommend.<br />[[ASIN:0061537969 The Art of Racing in the Rain: A Novel]]
B00CL0J99K|5.0|When you combine Shane Black, and Robert Downey Jr., you should expect nothing but greatness. Their 2005 collaboration Kiss Kiss Bang Bang, was truly the film that set up RDJ on the incredible run that he is currently on. Iron Man 3 takes the chemistry that was on display there, and amps it up with Black's touch of his Lethal Weapon writing, and RDJ's amazing take on Tony Stark.<br /><br />While I won't give away much about the story, I will say this film touches on some real world issues, and pays homage to many current Iron Man stories, especially Matt Fraction's run on Invincible Iron Man.<br /><br />It may be a notch below The Avengers, but Iron Man 3 is an amazing start to Phase 2 of the Marvel Cinematic Universe. Can't wait to see what else is to come with the rest of our fellow Avengers.
B005S9EJ14|5.0|This is basically a geriatric fairy-tale set in Jaipur, with a disparate group of mature British expatriates attempting to live their latter days in a hotel geared to their needs.The Indian setting is well-established, the clash of cultures amusing, the characters sufficiently well-drawn to be interesting. With a cast of excellent British actors and introducing some equally fine performers from the sub-continent, this is a funny and entertaining movie.  It's a delight, for a change, to see a film for and about older people.
B0088X7YU0|1.0|I have the first three Starship Troopers movies. I missed somewhere that this was a cartoon/animated movie, and ordered it. It totally sucks, I hate cartoons. Had I noticed that it was what it is, I would never have bought it. If you think I will be more careful what I buy in the future, you are right !! This will never, ever happen again.
B005D6O0IY|5.0|These style of Crocs are my favorite.  They are just SO comfortable.  I also own a black pair and love them just as much.
B000JMKTLO|4.0|A truly excellent writing style that gives some telling glimpses into the dark and depressing world of mental perversion. Scary stuff that appears to be all too real.
B00005JKNF|5.0|Before Downton Abbey there was Gosford Park, a complicated tale of relationships, snobbery, intrigues and murder, with a stellar cast of terrific British (and a couple of American) actors. Pay attention! You don't want to miss a minute.
B003Q6D2B4|5.0|Bruce Willis being Bruce Willis.  The rest of the cast fit perfectly.  A plausible story done with humor.  Hellen Miren as an assin, Morgan Freeman as a terminally ill retired CIA agent, John Malcovitch as burned out retired agent.  One of those movies you keep going back to.
B00992CF6W|5.0|Minecraft is one of the best games I have ever played in my days if you want to have a good and fun game Minecraft just right for you.

B00499NHLC|5.0|Fun, Interesting, and Engaging entertainment.  While there is some violence, I get to avoid the trifecta of sex and foul language that consumes so many other shows.
B00ABGEFWC|5.0|Littlest Pet Shop is a very fun game that allows you to build and manage your own pet shops with the fun of caring for the animals that are already in your shop to begin with. the more friends you play with the easier it is to expand and progress in the game
B0025UHKNS|4.0|I love the blue color. Good reliable GPS watch for running. Took a while to figure out how to load Garmin app into computer.
B00005TQKQ|4.0|It's doing the job it was made to do. Imagine that! So I like it because I don't have to send it back. I recommend this head cleaning tape to anyone who needs their heads cleaned.

B0071BGOJC|5.0|I love history, and this was really good, as it incorporated history with some wonderful fictional characters, so brought<br />everything to life.
B006P4FBUE|3.0|The sound is pretty good, but the song choices are not so good. They are more for a child between 6 and 12.
B009FZHYKU|5.0|I had not watched The Walking Dead until this past year, and when I did I caught up quickly because it was so good. If you like action and gore this is the show for you.
B003JTHXOK|5.0|I loved this book.  I watched the movie first, but the book was so much better.  I would read it again
B004WR125O|5.0|My Onkyo AVR didn't come with one of these and I couldn't hard wire it to my router so I was left with no choice but to purchase this adapter.<br />It's great.  The set-up was brainless and it works as advertised.<br />My only complaint is that I have to plug it into the front of my AVR (this may be different depending your model) so it sticks out a bit. Not a big deal.
B003G4W49C|4.0|Although I had a hard time keeping in mind that Ender was a VERY young boy genius, I thought it was a good story told through his eyes. I'm not sure how this is supposed to be a quintet, but I'm eager to go on to the next book.
B00136Q6DA|5.0|Bought this album for only $5!! Sara Bareilles is a great artist, so I am pleased with this purchase and price.
0345529057|5.0|Started watching the series and had to read the books.  Of course the books go into detail so I am enjoying the books just as much.  This is the first time I have read George R. R. Martin and plan to buy and read more of his books.  Thoroughly recommend A Song of Ice and Fire if you love fantasy, romance, and dragons, these book are for you.
B000PMLFRA|5.0|Great movies. Nice to get them all together. My son loved getting to watch them all. Just like I remember growing up.
B001UV4XHY|5.0|I loved it! Will buy another title of the same kind if one comes out in the near future. I am waiting!
B000YHG72E|5.0|This is a must watch movie. I hadn't watched it until this past Christmas, and now I will put it on my list of movies to watch every Christmas.
B002QE3CTY|5.0|The Maze Runner is a good book for fans of the hunger games. With the mixture of greivers, W.I.C.K.E.D and moving maze walls Thomas doesn't think he will ever escape the Glade. Also with the arrival of a GIRL Thomas doesn't know what to think.
B008DVJO8C|5.0|I love this CD. Some of the tracks are pointless background music, but besides that, they rock! Would deff buy this again
B008JGSM6G|5.0|I think that this game is fun because it's actually like connect the dots. Also I think that flow free gives you the chance to think. This is my review for the game Flow Free that I alwayyyyyyyyyysssssssss play
0316228532|2.0|Honestly I've tried reading it but there's so many characters too keep up with. I can't seem to get into it.
B003OF3R0S|5.0|This album kicks ass,Avenged Sevenfold did themselves proud,all killer no filler! If you like &#34;City Of Evil&#34; and &#34;Diamond In The Rough&#34; you'll love &#34;Nightmare&#34;. This band seems to get better with every album!!
B008JFC6F0|4.0|Some really good songs and some that are only okay.  Worth purchasing, though, and a band to watch in the future.
B00BHHIWQO|5.0|This app its great you can do a cheat , buying bombs or splash in the ap and use on the computer then use on your tablet o phone lol
B00AW8UK0K|5.0|Watched the show first then read the book.... Has changed my outlook on life and after only 3 weeks I have already dropped those stubborn kilos. I am not in it for the weight loss, I am in it for health benefits and since it is so easy to go for only two days a week without one meal, I will be continuing this for the foreseeable future.
B00A3NQNUU|5.0|It play it every day I love the dragons and the races I love it. Hope you like it to.
0385349947|5.0|What a great book for women especially but men will learn for this too.<br />Fast reading, interesting helped me look at my life choices differently.
B006M4F67A|5.0|Once I start playing, im hooked! Keeps My attention, very challenging! Different levels, from easy to hard, to very intense.
B00C2IGQBA|5.0|Gotham City, a big city where crim has been occuring lately and a mysterious caped crusader named Batman (Michael Keaton) is wiping streets clean of criminals, it leaves the police especially comissioner Gordon (Pat Hingle) baffled. A gangster named Jack Napier (Jack Nicholson) was dropped into a vat of chemicals which leaves him disfigures with paint-like white bleeched skin and ruby-red lips plus green hair which makes him clown-like as he now calls himself Joker, he begins to terrorize the city of Gotham and stalk a sexy photographer named Vickie Vale (Kim Bassinger). Bruce Wayne who is Gotham's richest man falls in love with Vickie yet she doesn't know his true secret that he's Batman, but can Bruce deal with romance and battling with Joker at the same time?<br /><br />A classic of the 80s and it was THE event movie of 1989 no doubt! after 50 years since Bob Kane and Bill Finger's DC comics creation has been made into serials in the 40s with a popular ABC TV show in the 60's with Filmation cartoons in the 70s especially on SuperFriends from Hanna-Barbara in the 70s to mid 80s. However in the 70s in comics Batman was changed back to his dark roots even in 1986 and 1987 when Frank Miller changed the face of comics with his excellent mini-series of \\"The Dark Knight Returns\\" and \\"Year One\\", these caught the attention of the media of how we can see Batman serious again. But since 1978 after the success of Warner's Superman adaptation that they were eyeing a Batman movie and took a decade of development hell, however in 1988 after the success of \\"Beetlejuice\\" director Tim Burton was assigned to do the film yet he did grew up with the 60's show but decided to read Alan Moore's brilliant 1988 graphic novel \\"The Killing Joke\\" and he adored it as he became a bigger fan of Batman as he directed the film. Jack Nicholson was nicely casted as Joker i should say, while not as excellent as Ledger's Joker still Jack's Joker is alot of fun and he stole the show no doubt.<br /><br />Michael Keaton caused an uproar when he was casted as Batman as fans boycotted the idea yet in Christmas 1988 when the trailer hit theaters the silence was shut as it was a nice teaser. This movie was the most hyped movie of 1989 as months audiences including fans had waited even with a second trailer that showed up in the spring of 1989 and merchandise was everywhere as it was the year of the Batman, hell even TV stations had reruns of the 60's Batman show to cash-in on the phenomenon. This movie opened on June 21st 1989 and became one of the highest grossing movies of all time and the biggest movie of the year earning acclaim and making Batman cool again just like Frank Miller and Alan Moore did. It launched a franchise and influenced many films from \\"Dick Tracy\\" to \\"Darkman\\" to others of it's kind just like Richard Donner's \\"Superman\\" movies did, hell it was even admired by Christopher Nolan when he did his reboot of the franchise to even spawning the animated series in the 90s which had influences from Burton and the comics. The film co-stars Robert Wuhl as photographer Alexander Knox with Billie Dee Williams as Harvey Dent then Michael Gough as Alfred with Jack Palance as Grissom, it's a highly entertaining, well written and well acted action adventure from screenwriter Charles Hamm and director Tim Burton. I should say Keaton did a nice job as both Wayne and Batman as he convinced audiences, i remembered when i was 7 seeing this movie on the big screen 6 times and i had nearly all the merchandise as i was Batman obsessed that year and i even ate the cereal plus i collected the comics since then but before that i was more into Superman, Swamp Thing, Aquaman and other DC heroes but this movie made me a bigger fan of Batman since despite Swamp Thing is still my favorite DC character. I even got this movie with the NES game for christmas that year and i watched reruns of the 60's batman show all the time, hell i even saw all the Batman movies in theaters and even watched and taped the awesome animated show religiously all the time on Fox and WB. This movie is still excellent even in these days of Dark Knight mania, let's never forgot how Batman became dark again on film after the 60's with this one.<br /><br />This blu-ray offers a very crisp quality high definition picture and terrific surround sound and extras galore such as audio commentary, trailer, 3 music videos, documentary gallery, Legends of the Dark Knight the history of Batman over the seven decades, On the Set with Bob Kane from 1989, Heroes and Villains profile galleries, Shadows of the Bat the Cinematic Saga of the Dark Knight Parts 1 to 3 (which continues on Batman Returns's blu-ray) and Batman: The Complete Robin Storyboard sequence. This is an excellent bargain for high def lovers and fans of the film, a definite purchase for an upgrade.en watched and taped the awesome animated show religiously all the time on Fox and WB.

B009R659L8|5.0|Mary Higgins Clark lived up to her reputation by yet again providing a great storyline!  I could not put the book down, very spell binding.
B008XKSW7M|5.0|This movie was great. Gave you 3 different women with 3 different situations. I loved this movie and would love to watch it again.
B00932A4XE|2.0|i would have to say that this movie is for folding laundry and cleaning the house.  Otherwise I would not suggest this movie.
B00881VLCE|4.0|I took a chance on this app because it was free and I'm glad I did. I've enjoyed doing these puzzles. The starter pictures are fun and you can get more pictures to add to your collection. I've really liked the feature that allows you to choose the number of pieces. Some days I want a harder puzzle, other days I don't.
B0027MJU00|5.0|I like a book that grabs attention and hold you. Altho' the author paints truly sad situations, perhaps because they don't relate to anyone in my own life, I'm intrigued, no depressed.
B00C7TAF3Y|5.0|I'm not big on puzzle games, but this one is awesome. It makes you think and its fun at the same time.
B006LSZECO|5.0|I would suggest this to anyone looking for a read on a long flight.  It is interesting and thrilling but still an easy read.
B00C7TAF3Y|5.0|I can't seem to stop!  Each step is more mezmerizing!  Great for when you are laid up from surgery.  It helps pass the time away.
B0038Z5T4Q|5.0|Commanding performances by Michael Douglas and Charlie Sheen punctuate a great movie of the 1980s world of financial capitalism. Douglas, as Gordon Gekko, leaves you thinking that greed actually is good or that it is the ultimate temptation, or both.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|The Hunger Games series will be the series after Harry Potter that will get your kids back into reading.  It is interesting and probably a little older demographic than the HP series but still a great read.
B002DD67XG|5.0|Big fan of James Taylor and I like to listen to his stuff while walking my dogs every morning,.....Yep! boy
0767805712|5.0|A sci-fi movie that deals with the very essence of freedom and equality. The film is as perfect in its details as Vincent Anton Freeman (played by Ethan Hawke) has to be in passing for Jerome Eugene Morrow (played by Jude Law).
B0097PW7H8|3.0|It gives instant word and pictoral display ot the condition of your Kindal Fire battery. It takes the guess work out of knowing when you need yo recharge your battery. A negative is that it consumes a lot of your batter power to run this apt and you find yourself having to recharge your battery more often than is normal.
B007TNQ7EY|5.0|This game is awesome it is just like gta you can kill things like cops and other people. GEt this app know it is awesome.
B000FVQLQQ|5.0|The movie tells the story of a man's struggle with mental illness, and of his wife's struggle with him, in a way that is haunting. Ronnie Howard, who could be accused of sugar-coating some of the actual facts of the story, employs a variety of allegorical devices to communicate the story to a mass audience. For those who know, the allegorical devices can be accepted for what they are.
B008LFY6NI|5.0|This is an awesome thing for art.It's Fun to make the spin art,plus you can pic what colors you want
B000066C6Z|5.0|The world has changed a lot since this movie was released. So, much of the humor in it might be lost to younger viewers. Even so, the movie is hilarious, fast paced and irreverent. Should I mention that it is not p.c. regarding a certain aspect of lifestyle choice?
B007XAYKX8|5.0|I really liked this film and have watched it several times.  The camera angles are great and succeed in building tension.
B00A3NQNUU|3.0|I love the game Dragonvale, I have it on my IPhone and on my Kindle Fire HD. However, on the last update on my Kindle Fire, it completely reset my entire game. I lost over 2 million dragon bucks, and 20 dragons. I was kind of peeved. I will probably start over but what the heck. This is the second game on my kindle in which their was an update and all of my previous data was completely wiped out, it is very frustrating, and a pain in the ars. Please do something about it!!!!!
B008673ZAQ|4.0|I liked the storyline and the plot of the book. The characters of the book are well developed and you can easily like them.<br /><br />I like trilogies as they prolong my relationship with the characters in general.
B004QX07G4|5.0|Loved every sentence of it. Definitely shows how wonderful Ellen as a person and a comedian truly is. Just wonderful.
B00846REIS|3.0|Easy read.<br /><br />The characters are nicely developed and you get attached to them. I like the plot of the books and it made me buy the rest of the trilogy.
B003VPWX6K|2.0|Couldn't get sat the first 80 pages. It just wasn't for me because others in my book club really liked it.
B001J3U22S|5.0|Taking Brian Herbert as a separate inspiration from his father, Frank, the originator of the Dune universe, the conclusion of the series stands as masterpiece. The prequel to the Dune prequel is a page-turner.
B00A8MGLAI|5.0|I loved a few films in 2012, not really a great year for films really.  The Oscar winners?  Please.  What a joke, for the most part, as usual.  Argo??  Are you kidding me!  Django Unchained was MUCH better!  But the best film of 2012?  Cloud Atlas in a walk.  If not run.  Not only was it well made but it was beautiful.  The most fresh and original film in many years if not ever and I do mean ever!  How they made it is a story unto itself.  Check out all of the extras to see what I mean.  You had 12 actors playing 6 roles each!  And what actors!  I counted 5 Oscar winners in it.  (Tom Hanks counts as 2 of them).  When it was over, even at 3 hours long I immediately watched all of the extras and then I watched the entire film again.  It's that good and that unusual.
B001ANSSDC|4.0|Thankfully, I read the book before seeing the movie. The movie was so shallow it is hard to believe the hype.  I recommend reading this book even if you already watched and enjoyed the movie.
B00BTYP6QE|5.0|I wasn't really interested in reviewing the game just yet as I am still in the 4th chapter and have more important things to tend to, but I can easily say that there is no way this game is going to disappointment from here on out, so I figured it was safe to review it now. I was going to give it 4 stars because the little videos at the end of the chapters are not uploaded on youtube yet so you cant view them until they get released (even within the app) but &#34;I liked it&#34; just didn't sound right to me.
B00CHI5B7A|4.0|Great storyline great cast. The renting process is easy as a couple of clicks away. I will be purchasing and renting more movies from amazon in the future.
B002ZFQD04|5.0|This concert is MDNA (Oops, sorry...that's her latest tour) all the way through.  It's NON-STOP excitement and entertaining.  Even if you do not like Madonna ... YOU WILL LOVE THIS SHOW!!!!  Think about it, she's in her early 50's and keeping up with everyone on stage.  She apparently does power arobics and incorporates them into her show ... WoW!!!  That's all I can say about this concert...WoW!!!<br /><br />It's presented in both DVD/CD and while searching for a good price, I found a GREAT price through this dealer.  This seller is also the type of seller Amazon would be proud of for they solve problems quickly.  There was a small one with the dvd quality and the seller corrected it for me and QUICKLY!!  In other words, I would do business with them again and again.<br /><br />For the WoW factor alone, I would buy this package.
B006W0QR1S|5.0|It was worth the money and more.  The acting was great the plot was intense. Check out the opening scence of the first car chase thrilling.!!!!!!! 4 stars.
B004ZMWUCU|5.0|This is a story about loneliness.  The main character is very likeable and you find yourself hoping for him right until the end of the book.  I, myself have lived with profound loneliness earlier in life, and so I can easily relate to his feelings.  The story is well written and keeps your interest continually.  Well worth reading!
B001RUXW48|5.0|Great acting sinsational cast  amazon has made it easy to rent movies on their website keep up the good work.
B00CJ03K38|5.0|Awesome CD!  She always has great hits.!!!  I love her blend of languages, genres and creativity. I'm a super Inna fan and always have been.
B0043JDUNS|5.0|Action  Action Action from beginning to end a must see movie.  This is my 15th rental i work night shift and to be able to rent a good movie at night is like a cool pillow at night.  Thanks amazon.
B004VMUS9G|5.0|I love the fact that I can have my phone on silent and the alarm clock work with sound. I have a different alarm app that I paid for and it doesn't do close to the amount of things this app can do. I can customize it to play my own music for the alarm clock if I want to or use  standard sound.
B003R0LBVW|4.0|This book was long! Ugh! I'm not an environmentalist so I skipped a lot of that rhetoric. I was more interested in what was going on with the family. I loved how the author gave us more background about Patty and Walters upbringing. I better understood the characters I would've negatively prejudged had I not had the insight into their thoughts, their backgrounds, and their previous experiences. This was a very good, long, complicated, insightful book. :-)
B00881VLCE|3.0|This app is good. I love it &amp; so does my kids.. my only thing about it is it delays or stops running sometimes other than no problem.
