B004YM6JLO|5.0|I love the Vampire Diaries series. This season is just as great as the other seasons thus far!! Never read the books- but I am a fan of the TV series!
B00F91H666|1.0|Movie ends like a low budget TV show from 1970's, video game plot. Rip off of 28 Days Later. Sad
B008JGSM6G|3.0|Umm... its really fun and addicting! so u should totally get it but DONT GET THE UPDATE!!!  It says that when it wants you to do the update that its? 100% FREE. ITS NOT FREE IT TOOK 2 BUCKS OUT OF MY ACCOUNT INSTANLY!!!
B00BMKDTNC|5.0|I don't have time for a full on recap, but I will say that this book-this series- left me breathless at times and heartbroken that the journey is over. I'm a big Sanderson fan and I think he did an outstanding job of completing this series.  I can still hear Mat, Perrin, Thom, Morgaine, Naeneve, Tuon and a host of others voices in my head.  Just excellent story telling.  For me, it was everything I'd hoped and then some.  I loved it so much that I don't ever want anyone to attempt to capture this on film.  It's much more satisfying in my imagination.
B00E8KLWB4|3.0|This game isn't anything to write home about but it is playable with the occasional twist of  a head scratcher puzzle to keep you on your toes.  I don't think I would spend money on it.
B00DR0PDNE|5.0|I bought this device hoping that it would live up the the 'hype'.  I had another streaming device but found that it was much more labor intensive to get going.  The Google Chromecast was basically plug and play and go!  Loved getting the free trials to Netflix and Hulu.  All in all I highly recommend this product.  My needs are pretty simple and I didn't want to invest a ton to get the results I wanted.  This more than fills the bill.  I use my kindle to control it and it doesn't bother me in the least.  My one complaint is that I wish I could connect to my home network and stream movies that I have saved on my pc's.  From what I've read Google disables any 3rd party software that would give you that ability.  I'm hoping that in the very near future they will offer an upgrade to allow you to stream from your computers.
B00F35B8F8|1.0|What a disappointment!  This movie fails on so many levels: story, special effects, overall satisfaction.  After the first few minutes, I turned on my computer and just listened to the movie in the background.  It was that bad.  You be the judge.
B00E0SX118|5.0|GREAT FAMILY MOVIE THIS IS RECOMMEND FOR ALL AGES, THIS MAY BE  A CARTOON BUT  I GUARENTEE ALL WILL ENJOY IT!!!
B00DXP7L88|5.0|I just finished watching the final episode of Dexter. I must admit it was an emotional rollercoaster. I won't go into details about the ending. I don't want to be that person who ruins it for someone who hasn't been able to sit down and watch the final episode. Having Dexter on television was truly a Sunday night treat. We got to sit back and watch Dexter grow as a man,friend,father,killer,lover,husband,and just a person in general. Dexter goes from a man who makes calculated and cold decisions and turns out to be the emotional being that he/we thought he never could become. The ending to season eight concluded leaving me feeling very sad and joyous at the same time. Although it was bittersweet, it was still lovely to watch Dexter become a caring being. In the end he makes the ultimate sacrifice.....his most mature decision yet. The decision to put someone else's happiness before his own. To literally just......walk away. Although it's over, I feel like it ended on a good note. I am aware that some fans say the show lost steam throughout the seasons, but I must disagree with that. Almost every episode kept me on the edge of my seat. I found myself clenching the sides of the couch, being fearful when Dexter made bad decisions and even fast forwarding a few minutes ahead to make sure that Dexter would walk away from the current intense moment unscathed. Don't worry. I would always rewind and rewatch the scene soon as I knew Dexter was okay. I loved every season, every moment, and every Sunday night of Dexter. I would even have to remind myself that \\"This is just a TV show\\" as I watched with extreme intensity. The writers were brilliant and Michael C Hall along with Jennifer Carpenter created a wonderful vibe. What other show would make you want to root for a serial killer? And as a side note I was so happy that Jennifer and Michael remained professional and had a great connection even after the divorce. Any who, Dexter will be greatly missed. I never loved a show likeI loved Dexter and I highly doubt I will get deeply attached to another show after this.<br /><br />RIP Dexter,<br />Thank you for the wonderful times.<br /><br />Ps. Please don't create a corny spin off. It's over. Most of us will accept the fact that Dexter is over and still be able to sleep at night º<br /><br />Signed-A Serious Dexter lover <3
B00EMJD6TC|5.0|I REALLY ENJOYED THIS MOVIE! IT WAS FULL OF ACTION AND SUSPENSE AND THE ENDING WAS PRETTY COOL. I WOULD RECOMMEND THIS MOVE FOR ANY WHO LIKE SUSPENSE AND HORROR
B002VE5472|5.0|A who-dun-it on steroids, this movie is great! I hadn't seen previews or anything before deciding to watch it (mainly because I recognized the Resident Evil girl), but there was no disappointment in the least. I was blown out of the water. It's not predictable and keeps viewers guessing. I highly recommend if you like murder mysteries and adventures. This one is awesome.
B009JZSC9S|5.0|I like they are keeping the same characters and adding new ones.  Its great seeing Michael J. Fox in his part every once in a while. He is playing the bad guy superbly.  Well acted and written
B00A0SQBDM|1.0|Game started out below expectations. It was dull ans frustrating to have to keep reading the narration. It got good and I was really into it until I paid and unlocked the full version for 5 bucks and it didn't even save my game I had to start all over!!!!  For that it gets a ambassadors review. Not worth the time energy or money

B00DHRLK84|5.0|I heard great reviews on this movie, even though I am not a Zombie fan I gave it a shot and loved it. Awesome story line, very suspenseful, and the 3D was incredible. Very happy with this movie, there has not been a lot out this year that I can say were any good.
B008JFUUIA|5.0|Teenage boys and mom love this movie. My boys do not like singing movies; however, this movie they can watch over and over!!!
0744014956|5.0|This has a great flow. You don’t have to worry about flipping to a page and getting a spoiler, the design of the book is great easy to find what you are looking for. Has several maps so the maps are not over crowded with all the collectables or missions. I am not sure how in the heck anyone could get 100% completion on this game without this guide (or some sort of guide)
B00003CXBK|5.0|It continually amazes me when I find people who don't appreciate this movie.  Mainly because I think it's fantastic.  Of course, that applies to almost anything that Hayao Miyazaki does.<br /><br />Ashitaka is inflicted with a curse after a demon attacks his village.  Now, because he must find a way to save himself, he leaves his village forever to find the source of the demon.  A place far away that appears to be filled with hate.  But when he gets there he finds a battle being waged between the gods and spirits of the forest, and the people at Irontown who are trying to make a living for themselves.  And there's a plot to destroy the forest spirit, which could have all kinds of unforseen consequences.<br /><br />Characters:<br />Billy Crudup: Ashitaka<br />Claire Danes: San<br />Minnie Driver: Lady Eboshi<br />Billy Bob Thorton: Jigo<br /><br />When watching an animated film, I have to admit, I'm not really that concerned about the voices.  Because they're animated, I don't have any initial expectations on how they should sound.  So in my opinion, everbody did a good job of voicing their characters in this movie.  The characters themselves were varied and I love their personalities.  You have Ashitaka, the good guy, who is brave and strong and tries to do what is right all the time.  San, Princess Mononoke, is very strong in her convictions and vicious at the same time.  I like that she was the wild one as opposed to having Ashitaka being the wild one.  And Lady Eboshi, well if there was ever a \\"grey\\" character she was it.  She did so many things wrong but her heart was in the right place for a lot of it.  You just couldn't hate her despite what she was doings.  Simply amazing.<br /><br />The plot is a common one.  The \\"earth\\" against the humans trying to destroy it.  But the humans are likable.  Which just confuses everything.  Add into this a little bit of a love story, some humor, and being that all think they are doing the right thing, and you have an epic story right there.  And I think the paces moves quite well.  It's not too slow, but it doesn't rush by so fast that you can't understand what is going on.  And let's be honest, anything with Kodomas (tree spirits) is just awesome.  I've always hoped they'd make an alarm clock shaped like a Kodoma that rattled its head as the alarm.  I would buy it in an instant.<br /><br />I always like that in Miyazaki's work, you know it's animated, but at times there is animation that almost looks real.  Like the ripples of wind through tall grass or waves on the water.  It really adds to the experience.  And the colors are always bright and vibrant.  Lots of reds.  It's a real pleasure to view.  And the music is always understated and in the background, but it doesn't detract from the movie.  And just the images themselves are unique.  The Forest Spirit, the Kodomas, they are all interesting shapes and creatures with lots of detail.<br /><br />This is one of my favorite movies and one that actually has a permanent place on my shelf.  It never gets old.<br /><br />Review by M. Reynard 2013ry right there.  And I think the paces moves quite well.

B004047XXO|5.0|This movie was delivered very quickly. It was a great movie to watch with the kids. And the price was just right everything came in good working order. I would recommend buying from this seller :)
B00006JDVV|3.0|Dragons!  And Fire!  And Christian Bale!  And Matthew McConaughey!  Ok, I'm done with the exclamations.  You would think that with all these things combined together, this would be an excellent movie.  Sadly, it is only so-so.<br /><br />As a child, Quinn witnesses the beginning of the end while visiting his mother at a tunneling site.  They find a pocket, and in that pocket, deep underground, lurks a monster.  Flash forward in time and dragons have taken over the world.  Quinn is now grown, and running a compound where a rag tag group of people are doing their best to survive.  But when a troop of Americans come for a visit, things aren't going to stay the same for long.  Because they're dragon hunters.<br /><br />Characters:<br />Christian Bale: Quinn Abercromby<br />Matthew McConaughey: Denton Van Zan<br />Izabella Scorupco: Alex Jensen<br />Gerard Butler: Creedy<br /><br />Ok, Christian Bale, he's as serious as ever.  But as Quinn he's the strong solid type with a European accent that makes you melt.  Yeah, he was fun to watch.  But Matthew McConaughey scared me in this movie.  I'm not used to seeing him as a bald muscle man who doesn't crack a single joke throughout the entire movie.  He's just so serious.  It's odd.  And that part didn't work for me.  I just didn't think he was a good fit for the character.  Scorupco probably played the next biggest role.  But she doesn't have a lot of speaking parts so her character didn't really stand out at all.  But compared to the rest of the characters, she had a lot of screen time.  Mainly though, it was Bale and McConaughey driving this movie.<br /><br />Which means the script and dialogue would have had to be good.  But it wasn't that great.  It was exciting, full of action and great special effects.  But it would have been just as exciting without them talking because the dialogue didn't add anything.  And the plot was a bit unexplained.  I couldn't figure out how dragons (especially considering how they're able to kill them) were able to take over the world.  It was just a bit unexplainable.  And there was too much time between the discovery and the bulk of the movie.  I would have liked to see more of the in between time and development of the problem.<br /><br />The dragons were very realistic in this movie.  The fire effects, fantastic.  It's just pretty to watch even though it's technically destruction.  They did a great job with all the scenes and action because it didn't look forced or not true to real life.  If dragons existed, they would look and move like they did in this movie.  At least I think so.  And the music actually added to it.  Kind of rock like music that builds suspense.  And I liked the song that played during the credits.  It was appropriately fast paced enough.<br /><br />An exciting film, but I can't see it being awarded anything for dialogue or plot.  If you like action, you'll probably be alright with watching this movie.<br /><br />Review by M. Reynard 2013ill them) were able to take over the world.  It was just a bit unexplainable.

At first glance I knew I had to have this amazing collection of art from one of the lead artists for most of the series. For any art fan or fan of the series I highly recommend this. ^_^

B004ZMWUCU|4.0|Great use of convergence and foreshadowing.  I was drawn in by the rhythm of the Irish brogue.  The characters were all interesting and the dark depiction of life at the mercy of the Catholic church made me shudder.  It draws me in to learn more of the Magdelan Laundries that were hidden for so long.
B00DR0PDNE|3.0|**Decided to lower the rating as per my last update: see below**<br /><br />I can understand that many people feel like there is no need for this device since TV sets these days include internet connection. Or Blu Ray, or Playstation3/Xbox.<br /><br />Certainly, this device doesn't do anything besides what other devices do, but what it does, does it in a very nice way for a very affordable price.<br /><br />This device looks like a USB drive at first sight. It is about the same size. It will connect to HDMI connector in a TV and requires also to be connected to an electrical output as well. Of course you need a wi-fi network in your house to use this.<br /><br />There are a couple of ways to set it up. First, you can set it up from an iOS device or from an android device. The apps to do this are only available in certain regional stores, so many countries will not have access to these apps. Setting it up this way is really easy, you follow a few steps on screen to set it up. Once you set it up, the Chromecast starts signaling the wi-fi network that it is ready to receive signal from any device. From your device (smartphone or tablet) you select what you want to see and check a an option to send it to your TV. You can then use your device any way you want, as the broadcast is not a streaming from your device option, the chromecast will receive the information directly from the internet to stream in your TV.<br /><br />You can also set up the chromecast through a laptop, which is really easy. If you do it this way, you don't need to set it up through iOS or android devices. Once the chromecast is ready, the devices will discover the signal on their own. Pretty convenient. This is very convenient for regions where the app for iOS and Android is not available.<br /><br />You will be able to watch Netflix from your region, so don't expect the chromecast to bypass the regional lock on this and other services.<br /><br />I decided to give it 4 starts as I have discovered there are some issues with the audio. The audio suddenly doesn't synch or doesn't play correctly. You need to stop the transmission from your device so the chromecast can refresh, give it a minute or two and play again and it will usually solve the problem. I can imagine this might get improved with revisions to the device software.<br /><br />Update 10/27/13<br />I have been thinkering with the device a little and found several things worth noting.<br /><br />a) You can broadcast from your Chrome browser many streaming services. All you do is install an extension to your browser and there you go, the Chromecast will start showing your browser tab. If you select a complete screen view from the web player you are using, video will cover your TV screen. This is a very neat option.<br /><br />b) If for some reason you manage to bypass streaming services regional locks in your computer or laptop, for example, you find a way to watch US Netflix outside US, when you try to cast it into the Chromecast device, the device will not play. Chromecast downloads directly from the internet and it will recognize region locks.<br /><br />c) Chromecast just plainly doesn't like certain routers. I can't count how many times it just refuses to connect properly, drops connection or loses audio synch. I have done everything I can think of for the last month trying to get it to work, and simply there hasnt been any way to make it maintain a decent connect if the router is more than 3 meters away.<br /><br />If you are serious about streaming video to your TV, this might work for you, but be ready that it may not like your router and this will represent a headache for you to try to fix. On top of that, Google's support is kinda bad in that sense, the technical database they have is pretty limited and they force you to give them a call. I am probably selling this gadget and getting a different option.here are some issues with the audio. The audio suddenly doesn't synch or doesn't play correctly.

After checking Netflix with all my devices at different ranges, I concluded that the problem was indeed the router. The only problem in the router was the firmware update. I reverted the update and went to the prior firmware version and chromecast was working perfectly. I checked the internet to see if anyone was reporting something like that, but I couldn't find any reference, so maybe it is not an extended problem and maybe it just happens with this particular router and the current firmware. I still thought on sharing this information.
B00E95ED32|5.0|So worth the wait, Avicii has released yet another completely perfect set of tracks. The mixture of almost country/bluegrass tracks with the usual synth was surprising but wonderful and could only be pulled off by Avicii. 'You Make Me' with Salem Al Fakir and 'Wake Me Up' with Aloe Blacc are my current favorites.

0132350882|2.0|The book has some good advice, but I feel it could have been presented better. The book has many authors and that shows: the chapters feel disconnected and the writing style differs from chapter to chapter.<br /><br />All the examples are in Java. What is worse, Java is treated like it's the only language in existence. It would have made the book seem much more well-founded if it had talked about other languages too. Python, for example, has keyword arguments which allows you to mention the argument names at the call site. That makes code much more readable in my opinion and should have been discussed.<br /><br />The refactoring done would often make the code less readable: splitting a 20-30 line function into 5-10 individual functions doesn't help at all. The functions only obscure the intent of the overall function.
1419705644|3.0|As a father who fails to \\"get\\" this show so well loved by his children, despite sitting down and trying to watch a number of episodes, I leaped at the chance to purchase this book because I figured that by reading it before giving it to my children, I could better understand the show.<br /><br />Well, yes and no.<br /><br />This book DOES contain some useful information for both experienced fan and total newbie; just not as much as a book that retails for almost as much as a complete season of the show on DVD, [[ASIN:B007Q0JJHC Adventure Time: The Complete First Season]], [[ASIN:B00BDD1UYI Adventure Time: The Complete Second Season]], and [[ASIN:B00GOG120G Adventure Time: The Complete Third Season]], ought to IMHO.<br /><br />A big part of the problem was the decision to have it allegedly written by Hunson Abadeer, Lord of Evil, because this means we are treated to said imaginary author's (low) opinions of almost everyone and everything in Ooo and his threats to eventually destroy same.  As it turns out this works a lot better in the longer entries about major characters, like those in Book I, which contain a considerable amount of informational content, than it does in the shorter entries in Book II, which are composed almost entirely of rant with little to no informational content whatsoever.  With Books IV and V consisting almost entirely of pointless attempts at humor, that leaves Book III, which has a couple of useful travel guides.  That adds up to around 55 useful pages out of 155, which is rather low for a pricey hardback.<br /><br />Methinks the cause may have been real author Martin Olson's attempt to shoehorn the Adventure Time content into the format of his other book [[ASIN:1936239043 Encyclopaedia of Hell: An Invasion Manual for Demons Concerning the Planet Earth and the Human Race Which Infests It]] with considerably less success.<br /><br />Note: There is an alternative worth considering: [[ASIN:0843173289 Destination: Ooo: Land of Ooo in Under 20 Snails a Day (Adventure Time)]] is a phony travel guide to Ooo.

I have strong opinions about which guy she should end up with, but that's another story. I loved the action scenes too, during the actual \\"Hunger Games\\". I would recommend this book to anyone who loves a great story. It keeps you going right through to the end.
0316228532|2.0|I knew when I bought it that it was not anything like Harry Potter, all of the reviews said as much.  But I did expect the writing to be as good, just targeting a different (adult) audience.  I really think the writing was second rate, and if Rowling had been a first time writer I don't think this would have ever been published.<br />I gave it two stars because at least my curiosity was satisfied.
B00EL8I8IS|5.0|My boys are all into Zombies and I grew up hearing stories of them when I was growing up. This stories came from sailors who sailed threw the Carabian Island and South America.
B00328G4V6|1.0|Jimi recorded a lot of stuff.  Apparently there is a boxcar full of unreleased material.  Maybe it should remain unreleased.
B00E5Q1HJS|5.0|Wow, what a reverse role from the original &#34;Wrath Of Kahn.&#34; It proves how if history was changed somehow the future or preset would be too.
B00005K9QP|5.0|For some reason my music collection that goes back to the 60's did not include any John Mayall.  This plugged that hole, if you are into blues, this is a great one.
B007SGLZP8|3.0|This fiction is simply not my preference.  How one responds to any such work, depends upon one's experience, with books and with life.
B007U1FEJE|2.0|I was lonesome for some fresh Beach Boys, but this was disappointing.  My wife, who adores the Beach Boys, doesn't like it either, in fact, I think I like it more than she does--and I'm not fond of it at all.  Did see the Beach Boys in concert recently, even though it really wasn't all of them.  Had a blast, but more for the memories than the skill of the performance.  I do like that they keep on trying.  And I still LOVE &#34;Good Vibrations,&#34; one of my all time favorite tunes.  But it is not on this album.
B000SXLL8O|5.0|What is not to love about this band..Always lyricaly ahead of the pack and there sound is simply awesome. Truley a band anyone can listen too.
B004RSCWZ2|5.0|At first I wasn't all that taken by this album, but the more I listened to it the more I liked it.  Not everyone is going to like the Trucks sound, but I am sure that everyone loves the Tedeschi voice.  And I don't mean that she is better than him, I just think is more approachable than his very talented guitar work.<br />Anyway, this is one that might take more than one listen to fall in love with.
031623480X|5.0|I think this is one of the best books I've read all year, and I read a lot.  I also read \\"Wheat Belly\\" by William Davis MD, but I consider \\"Grain Brain\\" to be better researched and explained.  The author backs up his claims with solid research, and the result is to tell us that the vast majority of Americans eat a diet that is destined to make them fat and diabetic.  His recommended diet isn't easy, but I can guarantee you that if you care about your health, you will want to follow it after reading this book.  I also really appreciate his recommended supplements.  I've researched supplements extensively since my late husband's pancreatic cancer (he outlasted all of the doctor's predictions, but sadly I lost him last year), and Dr. Perlmutter REALLY knows his supplements (like alpha lipoic acid, tumeric, DHA, etc.).  He did say he did not recommend \\"diet sodas\\" but never explained why he didn't recommend them (at least that I could find anyway).  Since I like my diet sodas, I was kind of disappointed he never explained this, so if someone knows, please let me in on the secret.<br /><br />I'm going to buy a copy of this book for my dad who is a type II diabetic and on statins.  I've read enough about statins in the past to warn my dad off of them, or at least to take CoQ10 if he must remain on them, but he has ignored my advice thus far (I wish every cardiac doctor would read this book, because my dad is just following his doctor's advice).<br /><br />READ THIS BOOK!  You will be very glad that you did.
B007O4XX9K|4.0|Not the greatest album, but it certainly was nice to hear Joe again, and it certainly is entertaining.  Two (2) more words required.  (Brevity is the soul of lingerie.)
B00DC3DGSK|5.0|An amazing artist...Jimi Hendrix was right.  Incredible guitar work.  The rock n roll world owes a debt of gratitude to Buddy Guy and his friends.
0470449764|1.0|My wife had me buy this as a gift for a relative.  The strange thing, I think she really likes this relative.  Go figure.<br /><br />As to the merits of the volume if someone is facing the GMAT, I really don't have a clue, and the recipient ended up not taking the GMAT, so I don't know if it works, either.
B008JFUO4U|5.0|im not a fan of tom cruise, but the movie was great, the music! I fell in love with M83 (was already a big fan). Nice sci-fi movie, a must have.
B006ZCWU5K|2.0|I heard a lot of good things about this album, I thought I would really like it, I liked most, if not all, of his previous work.  This just seemed droning to me.<br />If you have everything else by Bruce, you probably will buy this one just for the completion of your set, but if you don't, there is better stuff out their by The Boss.
B00E0MCYPS|2.0|great concept, not so great execution.  cars are hard to control on my droid x2.  I still play, but it's not my go to game
B004LAIU4I|5.0|Paul Simon is a masterful musician and this album is no exception.  I listen to Simon when I want a little more mellow music but with a &#34;kick&#34; in the percussion.  The CD seems well-engineered as well, very clean, accurate CD with great dynamic range.
B00CXVX1OQ|4.0|button mashing fun, at least if there were buttons, tap the screen as fast as possible and knock your opponent out, great app to kill time
B006R1T40I|5.0|I've always been a fan since I heard Bonnie on the old Warner Brothers Samplers in the late 60's.  (Two vinyl discs for two bucks, all various artists WB wanted to promote.)<br />Bonnie seemed fresher on this album than some of her other recent ones.  She's actually playing here next month and I've got my tickets.<br />If you haven't liked previous Raitt albums, this one won't appeal to you, but if you like her work, this should be in your catalog.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|Subway surfed is one of the best games I love to play on my kindle. I cant put it down until I pass my high. Thanks
B00847KFDS|3.0|I had the strangest experience with this CD.  When I put it in my player, &#34;d1&#34; was displayed.  This happened 3 or 4 times. I tried the CD I had been playing and it worked well, and then I tried Made Up Mind by Tedeschi Trucks Band, and it worked. Then 4 seconds was played of the first song and it stopped.  When I reloaded it the whole thing played.  I'm going to try it a couple more times, but I'm kind of nervous about it.  Has anyone else had a similar problem with this disk?
B00CSR2J9I|5.0|I really love this game. It looks simple but can be maddening to play. It is so much fun. You really ought to try it.
B00E5Q1LTY|5.0|Filled with enough action, suspense, and depth to appease even the most die hard Trekkies, Into Darkness boldly goes where J.J. Abrams' imagination takes it while still remaining faithful to Gene Roddenberry's vision. With Abrams at the helm, Star Trek truly is going where no one has gone before. Sorry. I couldn't resist. :) Live long and prosper.
B00821OX98|5.0|I was not sure about this show, but it is really well done and keeps you really interested, I just finished all three seasons.
1442359315|4.0|This book did meet my expectations. It's in depth medical terminology and technical explanations were a bit beyond my understanding at times but overall I enjoyed the telling of this story.
B00821BLX4|2.0|It also doesn't seem to fit my camera that it was supposed to fit.  Didn't send back because I left the country.
B000O8OTNC|3.0|I expected it to be bigger but it still works well. I would say it is good for the price
0143038583|3.0|I am about halfway through this text and struggling to finish.  As others have pointed out, this is a meandering narrative.  I feel like in sections where he really should delve into the hard science, he glosses things over.  Conversely, much of the human/narrative side lacks direction.  The different points at which he inserts himself into the story seem forced.  I suspect he is trying to do what Eric Schlosser did in Fast Food Nation, but he does so much less effectively.<br />I am extremely interested in this topic, but this is just not a compelling read overall.  I have heard great things about this book by intelligent people, so perhaps it is just a failure on my part.  He does raise some interesting points, and the book is not without value.  In my opinion, it is need of heavy editing.  I will keep plugging along and finish this book eventually...
B00F91SCXC|5.0|I DON'T KNOW WHY THIS MOVIE IS GETTING BAD REVIEWS , AS FAR AS AN ACTION ZOMBIE MOVIE GOES IT WAS GREAT . I ACTUALLY WATCHED IT TWICE. I HATE THE BOOK BUT LOVED THE MOVIE
0399165274|3.0|From 1971's &#34;The Day of the Jackal&#34; to his 2010 offering &#34;The Cobra&#34;, Mr Forsyth has spun intricate tales that kept the reader on the edge of their seat.  From character development, to great plot twists, to the fine details of the locations, you got completely immersed in the story line.  His new book &#34;The Kill List&#34; is devoid of these characteristics.  The plot is fine however, character development is non-existent (to the point where you really didn't care about the characters), there are no plot twists, and the storyline could have occurred anywhere.<br /><br />Here are my thought after reading the Kill List: I'll assume that Mr Forsyth had a book  deadline coming due and he spent a whole weekend on his typewriter.  All I can say is: Fred - if it's about the money, then call James, and he'll teach you how to churn out 20 books in a weekend.
076115728X|4.0|Oops is one of our favorite words, my grandsons and I.  This is a fun book that held their interest.
140006922X|5.0|Put the life of Jesus into human terms.  made him a great political figure and man. easy to read and an excellent choice.
B00E00RB5I|5.0|Although I purchased this album as a gift, I have had the opportunity to listen to the songs, and they are excellent(as you would expect from the artists).  The group continues to sound as they did years ago, and my daughter is enjoying the music very much.
B004EPZ0AM|1.0|Haven't even opened it yet as I hope it can be returned. This is ONLY the blu-ray, does not have the DVD and ultraviolet digital copy! We didn't open it in time to return it as we bought it in advance of my daughters birthday, now it's past Amazons return expiry timeline - first time Amazon has let us down.
0143116177|2.0|I read the book to try and understand the development of the financial world and how we got about to today's financial markets. for this it was totally useless. This book is neither economy nor history; it's a bunch of nice stories somehow connected together. nothing more...
B000FCKGPC|5.0|This book got me hooked on the whole Game of Thrones series. I don't know why I waited so long to start!
B00APKIN1I|3.0|I'm an old rock fan. This has a great song by Stevie Nicks, but the screaming stuff was not my cup of tea. Love Dave Grohl's passion for putting this together with the original Neve console.
B000FBFN1U|5.0|Great book in the series with lots of twists and turns. I didn't want to put it down at all during the last 1/3 of the book!
1780721676|5.0|This book was very inspirational, but then so are many diet books. The proof is in the pudding, and I'm now on week 4 of the fast diet and right on target for weight loss. It's easier than I'd expected, frankly (although there have been a couple of days when I really had to distract myself in the late afternoon to stay with the plan), and I'm really happy with how I feel and looking forward to finally taking off the stubborn 10 pounds I'd gained. Healthy, sensible weight-loss plan that may also have important unseen results on body chemistry.
B000FC1HBY|5.0|Awesome story. A whole new chapter in what has to be one of the greatest books series of all time!
0671646788|4.0|I bought the book because it was mentioned in another book and I was curious to see what it was about.  Very much one of those you have to really visualize what you want to make it manifest.  I liked it.
B00AQNOCZ0|5.0|I bought this collection for a gift and they loved it.  If you know or are a Harry Potter fan - this is a must buy!
1609613937|5.0|I follow Dr McDougall and trust his research and opinions. This is a must read! And then a must follow for optimal health.<br />If you are not sure about a food (or medical problem), I highly recommend Dr. McDougall's books and website.
B00CHNKJFO|5.0|This is the best pinball game I have ever played short of playing the real thing. I highly recommend it for all ages.
B001ANYDAO|5.0|Gladwell is am amazing storyteller and theorist. I purchased Outliners after a stranger in a bookstore found me perusing Blink and told me three times I needed to read this book. I'm so glad I listened. Not only does Gladwell examine the formula behind success differently, but he explains it in detail. Some things can't be changed, but others are still within ones ability to influence. Highly Recommended!
B007IXWKUK|5.0|This book was actually better the first book.  I can't wait to get started on Book Three! Five stars for Book Two.
B00CM9JIZ0|5.0|I got this album expecting to be as good as said in the reviews I had read.  I'm glad it is. Despite being a little short, it is packed with great tunes and Todd La Torre is a great singer. The vinyl version comes with a cd but sadly the bonus tracks are missing there. Guess I'll have to buy the cd deluxe edition.  Very recommended.
B0042KA5EK|5.0|Luv Maggie Q. She kicks ass and  a really good actress.<br />Shane West is really hot! Xander Berkely makes a great villain<br />.
B00CXQL828|5.0|I got this record based on the recommendation of That metal show's Eddie Trunk.  He was right,  this album is amazing,  new music performed virtuously. Highly recommended.
B00B7PIRIE|5.0|THIS WAS A GIFT , THE RECIPEINT IS ENJOYING , NO PROLEMS  I WOULD RECOMMEND . NO MORE COMMENTS ON THIS PRODUCT
B005LAIIMG|1.0|I pre-ordered this movie as soon as it came out at the theater... but I cannot seem to get it to me.  It was released last week.... I can go to walmart and get it faster... I mean... I can wait a couple days but almost a week? Whats up with that?
B007ZGO7EM|4.0|It's a great calculator. Really, it's helped me allot with my home work and stuff. It'd just be great though if it had scientific calculations like square root and ( ) those thingies, u kno?
B005LAIH3G|5.0|I was in Peru when this movie came out.  I am such a fan of Edgar Rice Burroughs and his John Carter books, primarily since I read 6 of these books when I was a young boy learning to read.  The stories are fantastic and predate any Star Wars, Star Trek, Arthur C Clark, etc. writings and are most probably the source of most if not all the ideas that these movies were launched from.<br /><br />While in Peru (and I don't speak much spanish, relying on my wife to do so), I tried to see the movie \\"Juan Carter\\" at the local cinema, but they did not offer either close caption or headsets so I passed.  I am a strong anti-piracy person but tried to buy the DVD and some street merchant sold me what he said was the English version .. turned out to be a bootleg Russian copy with some guy in the audience standing up in front of the other guy doing the filming! ;-)  What a joke .. I kept the bootleg as a memory but don't think I will ever play it again ...<br /><br />Got back stateside and saw the movie on DVD, which I bought, and later bought the 3D version (having a 3D theatre in my home).  So, I have two copies, basically passing off since my earlier non-3D set to my father in Florida to own.  I loved it, the characters are great, the story line is great, the movie seems obviously written for a sequal (or 2, 6 or even 10!), and I have even repurchased Kindle copies of the first 6 John Carter novels to read (as I am again down in Peru).<br /><br />I am so disappointed in the terrible executive decisions made by Disney, in Marketing, to basically mess up this franchise so bad as to not have any plans on a sequel.  I hope that they wake up to know the value of what they have and can market correctly to all the fans of Edgar Rice Burroughs fantastic novels.  What a valuable franchise, what a great set of novels to bring to the screen.  Educate your audience Disney, give them the background of how this series predates any stories anyone has read about science and outer space since.  Build your audience, there is much history in these books .. and fantastic characters, writing, story line, romance, etc.Build your audience, there is much history in these books .. and fantastic characters, writing, story line, romance, etc.
B00DAXXO98|3.0|Really fantastic cast, performances, and storyline, but it's pretty slow and dry. I had watched Scandal previously and prefer it's pace more, but love the political dramas.
B00CWY76CC|4.0|I can not stop playing this game trying to get to the next room. I find myself playing it when ever I take a short break.
B00DR0PDNE|5.0|This thing works EXACTLY as advertised and I got it on time....go figure, I only needed it to stream Netflix to my flatscreen and it did exactly that
B00C8USQEM|5.0|Funniest show there is on TV. We never get tired of watching these!!! Getting ready to order season 6 and laugh even more!!
B003Z0BWR2|4.0|I felt like this book was more on par with the first, although perhaps the action bits were better handled than the first. There still were a lot of standing around talking between action, like everyone freezes so you can have a chat. The love story aspect got weirder, grosser and I had to stop to take a look at the next book to be sure this wasn't going the way I feared. Even given how this love story is wrapped up in the next book, it is still gross and wrong. We the reader might be able to find things out, but those two characters in that situation can't. I'll give Cassandra one thing, I've never faced this situation in a book before. So it's unique I suppose. If you can get over the love story (or maybe if you're into that type of thing), and you enjoyed the first book, then I think you'll enjoy this one too.
B00DR0PDNE|3.0|I was hopeful for this device and expected to own 2-3 of them. Wasted my money on just one.<br /><br />I own Apple TV, Negear Push2TV, Roku, Bestbuy Rocket Fish Miracast, and Samsung media dongle.  Im in constant search for the best wireless video display and source mirroring. I have found the Apple TV and Samsung Allshare cast dongle the best and most reliable connections and with few limitations to stream content.<br /><br />The Chromecast has potential, I guess, but is mostly I can't do that.<br /><br />If you are looking for a way to play your purchased Google movies, Neflix and You Tube, and THAT's ALL, from your closed WiFi network, this might be for you, and minus Google movies via Apple.  At present, only Netflix and You Tube can be streamed via Apple devices. But if you have other needs, it's not ready.<br /><br />If you want to use it at a hotel or other secure open wifi, it won't work.<br /><br />THE WAY IT WORKS<br /><br />From what I can tell, the device seems to be a smaller version of a media streamer, e.g. Roku player.  I think it works independently of of the tablet, phone or computer that you set up the wi-fi it works through.  However, even if your phone is connected to a wi-fi connection, the Chromecast won't connect if it is not truly an open connection or it does not connect through a secure password. E.g. if you connect though a network that requires you to enter the password via a browser after provider connection, it wont connect.  I also tried connecting it to a secure public network with WEP/WPK and the Chromecast would not connect.<br /><br />Although its claimed someone reverse engineered the device and could play media off the device, it seems the the Chromecast actually accesses the internet independently and not through the controlling device. Your computer, tablet or phone is only used to enter the wifi code through the Chromecast.<br /><br />WIFI REQUIRED, NOT WI FI DIRECT-DOESNT WORK ON PUBLIC NETWORKS<br /><br />Despite its smallsize, this is not a Miracast device and it needs to access the internet independent of the alleged source device.  It's unlikely to work on an open secure wi-fi system, and unlike Apple TV, which can still stream source media even if the internet is down, Chromecast can not stream if the internet is not working. I also tried connecting it to a secure public network with WEP/WPK and the Chromecast would not connect.<br /><br />NO PROFESSIONAL APPLICATION<br /><br />I was hoping to project powerpoint and business applications, but it cant be done, not even through Chrome browser.  The most you can do is stream Chrome internet media, provided both the device and the computer have internet access.
B00DU77QP2|4.0|I read this book because I was going to see the movie, and I wanted to read it before. I did enjoy this book, and I had the advantage of being able to see ahead for spoilers, but honestly, I don't know how this book became so popular when it first came out given how it ended. This book is aimed at young adults, but boasts a story about a brother and sister in love with each other. It felt uncomfortable, and grossed me out. However, I did buy the next one just to see how this was handled, so maybe it was really smart on the authors part. That one thing hooked me in some sort of sick way. The rest of the story was fine, it was a well-developed world (although once it was pointed out with Harry Potter, I could see all the ways things we slightly changed) and I did find that fascinating. I recommend this to anyone wondering what the hype is (because if you're already here, then you might as well just give it a go), and anyone looking for a new world to fall into.
B005K17RU0|4.0|Awesome app to know the weather. Sometimes it makes you fill out a review though to know what the weather is.
B003Z0BWT0|4.0|I was glad with how this book ended, and if you've read the first two, then I recommend reading this one to finish it. Most of it was solved, with just a couple loose ends to continue with the next trilogy if you'd like to. I was a bit disappointed about her Mom. *spoilers* After two books of trying to find a cure and wake her mother up, it's done behind the scenes, and was way too simple. I wanted that scene where Clary fights to get that cure, then goes back home to her Mom and then is by her side when she wakes up. Instead she just gave it away and then her mom just randomly pops in. Everything else story wise was fine (apart from the gross sibling love that went even further in this book, however after the first two books, I wasn't expecting any less).
B0058Z4NR8|2.0|Authors are very well read, intelligent, erudite gentlemen and the bookk contains a wealth of historical details in support of their arguments.  But I challenge any reader, after finishing this book, to summarize the authors´ ten or even five major conculusions.  And the length..this is 500* pages of very small print..it could easily have been cut by 1/3.  I challenge the authors to produce an expanded exective summary of <= 25 pages of their most important ideas and conclusions.  I also have a hunch that many who claim to have read the book did so via the approach many take to Joyce´s Ullyses . . when it really bogs down, just skip ahead ~25 pages (1/16 inch) and resume reading.  I promise you will wont know the difference.  I have recommended the book to others, but not one you read from cover to cover.
B001TCHDPS|4.0|This man has a great voice and what great songs!!  It is too bad that his original manager wasn't honest with him and didn't keep his music in the states for us all to enjoy all these years.
B0012GMWCU|5.0|Those who know, know.  Willie Dixon is immortal and this recording is a must have for anyone remotely interested in the blues.  Mr. Dixon was arguably<br />the single most influential A & R man ever (I'd vote John Hammond #2).  Someday when the REAL story of Chess Records is told, unlike \\"Cadillac Records\\" which suggests<br />Mr. Dixon was a footnote to Leonard Chess, SO laughable! [I HIGHLY recommend fans read Willie's biography by the same title] it will be clear why all the heavyweight<br />British rockers worshipped Chess Records--and WHO was the primary driving force.<br /><br />It was Mr. Dixon who signed  most of the greats to Chess, wrote many or most of their hits, played bass on so many of the sessions and produced<br />those timeless records which kicked the development of urban blues rock n roll into high gear.  Mr. Dixon's contributions can not be exaggerated.  Google the<br />cover versions of his compositions--it reads like a who's who of blues and rock.  How many albums pack so many classic songs-delivered by the master himself-<br />into one release?  For those who somehow dont seem to get this, may the music move you in the next lifetime!
B005F8CL1S|3.0|I love the music but the quality of the albums isn't as great as I had expected.  Still good though.
B00BRUQ7ZY|3.0|The book is written well, and Dr. Aslan sets up the background and context for his conclusion very well. However the book is very biased. The examples he chooses to use from the Bible are carefully selected to support his thesis (many times out of context), and he does not mention research and other ancient texts that refute his claims.
B002ZG9968|4.0|The DVD was fine, great condition.  The subject matter was pretty cute too. Cute story line and good acting.  Can't complain.

B004QOB8SO|5.0|Wow!  Gotta love Ben Cumberbatch; what a great actor!  I probably wouldn't normally be drawn to these movies - RomComs are much more my style, but Ben is awesome as Sherlock.  Loved the first episode of season two especially!

B009NFHF0Q|3.0|Good story. Some great moments. Found the writing to be A bit too wordy  for no other. Caused it to drag at somepoint
0761172726|4.0|I like the idea of this calendar, but as others have posted there isn't much room for more than one activity per day per person.  Since there is no preview you just have to hope for the best.  I've used it for a few weeks now and will continue to.  The stickers that come with also take up the whole square so you better not have anything else to put down...  as a mom of 4 we have lots of things going on at all times and usually more than one thing per day.  Plus the whole month is in one column so it's not easy to just glance at it and know what day you are supposed to be looking at.
B000MQPKVG|5.0|I love Stanley Kubrick and this is I think his only true period piece. I guess 2001 would be a period too but I mean past period. Acting is perfect...Ryan O'neal is wonderful, I remember seeing this film in the theaters when it first came out and now seeing it 35 year later its even better....
B007FG9LIE|5.0|The Pines is a grabber from start to finish.  The interaction of the people, their secrets and plight keep you guessing right up until the reveal. Blake Crouch is a master story teller and well worth time to get to know.

B00DR0PDNE|4.0|When using with Netflix or Youtube, this device is pretty awesome since it has a chromecast player built into those websites. If you have a smart tv, xbox, ps3, this is pretty pointless, but if you don't- this sort of turns it into that.<br /><br />BEWARE- You can only stream stuff on google chrome from your device. That means, if you have something on VLC or your computer, you will not be able to stream it directly to your tv. I really wish it had this capability.

B004132HZS|5.0|I've been recommending or buying as gifts the Sherlock Season 1 DVD for all my friends.  The stories are a perfect mix of sharp, clever, humor and suspense blended together.  The acting chops of Benedict Cumberbatch and Martin Freeman provide stellar performances.  If you don't believe me, just do a YouTube search on one of the fast paced diatribes where Cumberbatch spouts pages of dialogue in a single breath. The ingenious scripts by Mark Gartiss/Steven Moffat and direction by Paul McGuigan bring us one of the best BBC/PBS shows in history thus far.<br /><br />Eagerly anticipating and looking forward to Season 3...
B00F8GYC1Y|5.0|I was so happy that this was available on my Kindle Fire. It looks awesome, sounds awesome, and very fun. I really like that it is 2 separate games in 1, the Good Side and the Pork Side! VERY worth the $.99!!!!!!!

B0072GPQNG|5.0|I love this movie. I love animals and was amazed at how this horse was trained to do the things he did. I don't know if they used other horses or not. The friendship between horse and boy was wonderful. Most people today don't know too much about World War ! so it was a good history lesson.
B009Z59ZNE|5.0|The story line was great. I loved the show.  However, I was disappointed in the DVD's.  Some of them did not play well.  They would stop in the middle of play  and would not continue.  I had to jump ahead and miss whatever happened in that scene.

B00DR0PDNE|5.0|So here's the common question I hear from people. Because you control it using the Netflix-App & Youtube-app on your phone, does that mean it's streaming from your phone?<br />The answer is \\"No.\\" It has no effect on your phone's battery life. To test this, I started a netflix movie then removed the battery from my phone so I know it's definitely off. The movie ran to completion then chromecast sat there waiting for the next command. So, the phone is simply the remote-control. That is all. Once you start the youtube/netflix video, you can throw your phone into a blazing inferno and it has nothing to do with what the chromecast is doing. The nextflix & youtube app are inside the chromecast, the UI is on your phone.

B003QS9TKU|5.0|I still enjoy watching this movie, my grandchildren enjoyed it as much as I did when I was their age
B0082RHRHC|2.0|I read this as a teenager and enjoyed the story very much so I decided to reread it. The constant unrelenting introspection and criticisms by Jane about her feelings, herself, her employer and ward and his guests,and distant relatives became annoying as there was very little change or growth in her perspective.  I gave up over 1/2 through as it was tedious and boring (even though the plot was picking up).
B0050DIWFC|5.0|What a powerful book!!!<br /><br />I have read many books involving courtroom drama. Legal thrillers, legal mysteries, women's fiction with a courtroom climax, and even non-fictions written by legal professors and can't think of one that has left such an impact on me. I'm sorry to John Grisham, Scott Turow, and Michael Connelly but Defending Jacob explored and touch way more bases than either author has done in the past.<br /><br />Newton is rocked to it's core when the discovery of a 14-year old boy, Ben Rivkin, is found brutally murdered in the park. This suburb does not have these type of problems. Andy Barber is a resident of this town, and also works as a prosecutor in the District Attorney's office. He's ready to take on this case and find the killer when those hopes are derailed during the investigation. Evidence has suggested his son, Jacob Barber, is in fact the killer. How's that for irony?<br /><br />I say this novel explored a lot because of the many dilemmas it presents to the various characters. Andy Barber, also the narrator, is in disbelief and can't fathom his child could kill anything let alone a fellow classmate. This blindness he has for some of the truths that are being revealed can easily become annoying to the reader, but that's the point isn't it? How/when do you stop supporting and believing your loved one, especially your kid, when all the evidence suggests that you should? When do those rose-colored glasses come off and you accept that no matter what you did or didn't do as a parent, this monster is all yours?<br /><br />I don't want to imply that Jacob is a monster because he may have been guilty, therefore spoiling the the book for any future readers. No! I'm saying this kid is an absolute monster just cause. He's very emotionless and pretty much one of the worse teen characters I've had the pleasure of reading in a long while. He doesn't seem to take the situation seriously and is a quite embellished narcissitic character bordering on caricature. I'm sure now after reading the ending (which is definitely going to blow some minds) that it's good he was written this way... although it made for seriously annoying moments.<br /><br />Defending Jacob also explores the relationship between nature and nurture. There are a few chapters devoted to seeing if Jacob has the \\"Murder\\" gene given Andy Barbers lineage. This is something fresh and new in the legal thriller realm and handled well by Landay. Because it's not something that is as commonly used in true courtrooms, Landay sneaks it in through the back door during a grand jury deposition.<br /><br />Speaking of grand jury depositions. The narration varies between Andy Barber almost telling a story... as if writing a memoir of sorts, then pieces of transcript are given to support that point in the story. I found that to be pretty fun and broke up the monotony of Andy's narration. He was almost becoming just as unlikeable as his son Jacob.<br /><br />This is a novel about family, guilt, innocence, nature, nurture, and everything in between. The courtroom scene is just the icing on the cake for Defending Jacob because the author really lands his knockout punch in the last 20 pages or so. Every time I thought I had this figured out, another layer was added that made the mystery of whodunit still a... well a mystery. Thanks for that William Landay. I will be adding more of his novels to my shelf!aricature.

B00BGI08GG|5.0|I went into \\"Arrow\\" with low expectations and was suprised with the writing and how good the season ended up being as a whole. I must admit, i am a DC fan and i enjoyed \\"Smallville\\" but the freak of the week episodes got to me after a while. The overall story arc was great but there were a lot of filler episodes which is to be expected. \\" Arrow\\" however is an emotional, darker story with so many layers. It is really two main stories playing out during the season. The present, and at the same time flashbacks on the island telling an origin story. Every supporting actor also has a GREAT, unique story line that really fleshes out each character. Even if you are not a Green Arrow fan, this show is a must watch.<br />The Blu-Ray set itself is great with 4 Blu-Ray discs and 5 DVD discs packaged in a thick hard plastic Blu-Ray case, not cardboard. The case however does come in a nice cardboard slipcover. The quality of the video on the Blu-Ray discs are great. The pilot episode did have some issues as far as orange looking skintones and maybe a few banding issues but as the series goes along the episodes look better and better and the detail even in dark scenes is amazing. There are some demo material episodes, so as a whole this is a great looking Blu-Ray set. There are special features on disc 4 such as \\"Arrow Comes Alive\\" where the creators of the show talk about where they got their inspiration for the kind of story they wanted to tell. The \\"Arrow\\" cast and crew at Paleyfest where they meet their fans and are on stage being interviewed by none other than Geoff Johns. There are also deleted scenes on almost every episode of the season and also a short Gag reel (also on disc 4).  One more feature is \\"Arrow\\" Fight school/Stunt school where it shows expertly choreographed fights and amazing stunts and feature film quality visual effects.<br /> Overall, this is a must own for me and i highly recommend this Blu-Ray for casual fans as well. I can't wait for season 2!!
B001GCUO1Q|5.0|I would not classify myself as an obsessed fan of Marvel's Wolverine character, but Hugh Jackman really makes this hero come alive on the screen.  In general, I have enjoyed X-Mutants films in the past. I saw this movie at a theater and decided to also purchase this DVD.  This movie explains the origins of Logan Wolverine's past showing his capacity of violence as well as romance.  He also encounters other mutants in this action packed film.<br /><br />This movie is 107 minutes long and fans of Wolverine will view this DVD many times.<br /><br />In conclusion, if you enjoy the X-Men saga, especially Wolverine, you should check out this film  A fun film to watch.<br /><br />Rating:  5 Stars.

B000J103OI|5.0|this was a great dvd. laughed along with the actors. thanks for selling it to me at such a great price.
B0009O9LWK|4.0|This movie really affected me when I first saw it on TV in the early 70's. In fact, the final scene was imprinted on my brain and I always thought it was one of the most movingly romantic scenes ever. When I found this DVD was available, I was SO excited!! At less than $6.00 it was a steal. Unfortunately, as with most young infatuations, time and maturity kind of dulled this one. I still love George C Scott as Edward, but Jane - although described as 'plain', is anything but. And the final scene? Darn. The one in my memory was better. Still, if you are a Jane Eyre fan, this should be in your collection.
0440245915|4.0|A Time to Kill is John Grisham's first novel; it made the New York Times #1 Bestseller list, and was later made into a movie.  The story opens as two rednecks, Billy Ray Cobb and Pete Willard, have kidnapped a 10-year-old black girl, Tonya Hailey, repeatedly raped and beat her, then left her for dead in the middle of a road.  Later that night, both are laughing and bragging about it while at their favorite bar.  They are arrested, Willard signs a confession, and they are charged.<br /><br />Tonya's father, Carl Lee Hailey, is furious and devastated; he knows that because the perpetrators are white and because his daughter is black, there is a very strong possibility that Cobb and Willard will get off.  He acquires an M-16 from a friend, hides out in a janitor closet, and when the prisoners are being taken back to jail from the court, he blows them away.  The main plot of the book is his trial.<br /><br />Although the primary outcome of the story is whether the jury finds Hailey guilty or not guilty, the story focuses on black and white interaction in the small Mississippi town of Clanton.  It seems that everyone in the town is involved, as well as others from neighboring towns.  Jake Brigance, Carl Lee's lawyer, is young and fairly inexperienced; he is, however driven, and works hard (in spite  of a very cunning and seasoned prosecutor) to convince the jury to give his client a verdict of not guilty, which is, in this town, an almost impossible feat.<br /><br />During the course of the story, there is conflict between Brigance and a very arrogant prosecutor who is using this case to further his own political ambitions.  In addition the Klu Klux Klan gets involved, murdering several people, burning crosses and homes, and kidnapping and beating some of the main characters.  The black churches are also involved, and the story exposes the corruption of the leaders in many of them.<br /><br />All-in-all, A Time to Kill is an excellent read.  Grisham is a master story teller and his courtroom dramas are fascinating.  There is much suspense throughout this book, and the reader is kept on the edge of his seat awaiting the outcome of the trial and the story in general.  One thing that was disappointing was that most of the really bad guys were never caught or prosecuted.  It would have been nice to see justice for those who were victims.  This is, however, not a book to miss, and even though it has been out for many years, it's well-worth reading, if not only to understand the racism that existed in the small towns in the South when the book was written; unfortunately some still exists.  Readers will not be disappointed and will be mesmerized from beginning to end.<br /><br />This book was purchased with personal funds and no promotion of the book was solicited by the author or publisher.ler and his courtroom dramas are fascinating.

B00DR0PDNE|5.0|The Chromecast is amazing, if you have a good internet connection and know your way around a computer, you will love this product! I have been using it for shows and streams and have just about cancelled my cable because of it. It has a built in Netflix and Youtube app that is automatically activated and more apps are soon to come. The one iffy thing is that it gets a little hot when used but that manual says that it is normal and nothing to worry about.<br /><br />For $35 though you should try it if you are on the fence!
B005F9TQBU|4.0|Excellent Latin jazz fusion record from Santana. The quality of the entire album is even more amazing since the classic Santana lineup was imploding during the recording of this album. It's a shame that the music from this album doesn't get more airplay.
B0054S6N04|4.0|I like this book for two reasons, the state and city it took place in, I could relate to.  The story was very good and kept you riveted to the end.  Good book.
B0071XO8RA|5.0|Wool, and the rest of the series, combine the three types of reading I like best. First, great writing, pure and simple. You'll see this right away in the first line, first paragraph, first page of Wool. I found myself taking my time and just soaking up the way the author can turn a phrase, describe a scene, or relay a character's thoughts. To me, the writing hit the sweet spot between simple, plain straightforward prose and poetic musing so dense you have to re-read sentences multliple times. I did find a simple and deep poetry in the writing, but nothing I had to work for. On the other hand, the pacing never suffered. I will read some of the classics, like War and Peace, to enjoy the writing even though I honestly can't keep the plot straight in my head sometimes. Wool, however, pulled me forward like the best spy thriller or \\"light\\" read. It pulled me forward so hard and so fast that I had to re-read sentences because I was missing some of the beauty to see the story advance. The last element I noticed is that that Wool, and the rest of the series, are though-provoking. This is the type of writing that uses science fiction to gain freedom from the confines of our reality in order to tell a story that asks universal questions that apply here and now as well. Sort of a thought experiment. So, to wrap it up: awesome, apt, and poetical writing that moves and pulls while provoking deep thinking. Can't ask for anything more than that!

B008QTV3X0|5.0|Watched all the episodes within just a few days, it's like a book you can't put down.  I don't watch all that many shows regularly, but this one is truly special.  The writing is superb, the actors are all beyond superb.  My favorties are Damian Lewis, Clare Danes, and the wonderful Mandy Patinkin.  And don't forget Mona Baccarin, she's also exceptional.  Each episode ends with a cliffhanger than makes you want to watch more.  Truly the most riveting series I've ever watched.  Only problem is that since I don't subscribe to Showtime, I had to wait a year to see Season 2, which was just as good.  Now I'm hungering for Season 3, which is about to start.  Unfortunately, on top of the regular Dish rates, Showtime is just too much more for me to get, unfortunately for me.
B005LAIHY0|1.0|Rubbish. Not many original ideas thoughts in this movie.<br />Not believable at all (I know it's a sci fi... but still).<br />Just my opinion, yours may be different.

1451626096|3.0|An interesting character study of Princess Elizabeth, daughter of Edward IV and Elizabeth Woodville who becomes Queen Consort of Henry VII. The premise is that she was in love and intimate with her own Uncle, Richard III was something that I am skeptical about. If she had been his lover would she not have gotten pregnant, since she got pregnant readily with Henry VII's child? It also brought about several chapters of her raging and whining about missing her lover and constantly thinking about him (even fantasizing she was married to him and pregnant with his child). Her constant thinking of Richard to me made her somewhat annoying. Henry VII comes across as a rather cold hearted brutal husband, who forces  her to sleep with him so he can see if she is fertile enough to have royal children with him. The first encounter is difficult to read he is very abusive and treats her like a prostitute. After he finds out she's pregnant they marry and he cuts her so she bleeds on the bed \\"proving\\" she was a virgin. I find that whole plotline not feasible since if Henry knew she was not a virgin and had an incestuous relationship with her Uncle, he would have looked elsewhere for a wife. Elizabeth did have younger sisters that he could have chosen if she had previous experience. Theoretically, Henry and Elizabeth's son Arthur could have been conceived on the wedding night.  Later Henry and Elizabeth bonded then he turned cold to her again because of Perkin Warbeck who claimed he was Prince Richard, Elizabeth's brother (the author depicts Warbeck the genuine article and not an imposter).  More could have been written about family dynamics of the first Tudor King and Queen and their children. The book does not end with Elizabeth's death after having their last child Catherine, soon after Prince Arthur died.  I think Elizabeth was a dutiful wife to Henry Tudor and according to various accounts they achieved a happy marriage. The book is good as far as it being historical fiction butElizabeth's obsession with Richard and Henry's brutality towards her were negatives for me.

B005WUHAX8|5.0|So I got this case for my self and I loved it I took it swimming and all sorts of stuff it was amazing, but then I upgraded to the iPhone five and then I had to give my iPhone 4 and my lifeproof case to my boyfriend who is ridiculously tough on phones and cases, so the other day he came to my boat and he dropped the phone into the bay while walking the dogs. he was really sad and thought he had lost his phone and about two days later he decided that he was going to get some goggles and flippers and dive down and it's about 20 feet down and so he goes and dives down and by some luck the tide had not moved the iPhone at all and he brought it up and he took it out of the lifeproof case and it was completely fine and works perfectly!!!!!! So that day I went out and bought a lifeproof case for my iphone 5 I'm so amazed that after two days and twenty feet at the bottom of the bay the phone works perfectly!!!!!!!!!!
B00DR0PDNE|2.0|I own a couple of Rokus, and have purchased and returned two Apple TVs. I'm in a Tivo household, and owned by Time Warner, so I do not have video on demand. I bought Chromecast in order to stream the TWC website and vod programs, but alas, it doesn't work well. The streaming is choppy, as it is on the TWC website (thanks Time Warner), but even worse, there is no audio at all because Chromecast is not compatible with the Silverlight plugin that TWC uses. So the whole thing was pretty much a bust. I'm keeping it because it was so cheap and who know what upgrades will eventually happen. But until then, it's pretty useless compared to the Roku and all the other apps on the Tivo, the Sony Blu-Ray, and the Vizio HDTV. Ah well, so it goes.
B0062KMDZ2|4.0|this movie for was good, my son enjoyed a lot this movie,when i bought this movie i forggoten read the languages and not have spanish only subtittles,i was my foul but this movie is ok.
B00DWZHTRW|2.0|Now You See Me pits an elite group of world renown magicians, The Four Horsemen, against a disgruntled FBI agent in an intense game of cat and mouse. With a serious vendetta against the illusionists, Dylan Rhodes (Mark Ruffalo) teams up with Interpol agent, Alma Dray (M&eacute;lanie Laurent) to catch The Horsemen off their guard. The illusionists have been given an impossible mission---to pull off a series of daring heists, stealing from a bevy of corrupt business leaders. And they do, in front of an audience during their show. And like modern-day Robin Hoods, they generously shower the stolen profits upon the unsuspecting crowd, all while staying one step ahead of the law.<br /><br />I love movies that use real-life magic as a premise, movies like The Illusionist and The Prestige, so when I first saw the trailer for Now You See Me, I was really excited. Now You See Me had quickly become one of my most anticipated movies of the year. And much to my disappointment, it has also become one of the biggest letdowns of the year.<br /><br />This movie has an all-star cast (Woody Harrelson, Isla Fisher, Jesse Eisenberg, Morgan Freeman, Michael Cain & Dave Franco), intriguing premise and SO much potential. So where did it go wrong? Poor character development, a shoddy script and too much time focusing on befuddling the viewer, for starters. It very much reminded me of The Gangster Squad with it's lack of intellectual integrity and try-too-hard attitude.<br /><br />They turn Agent Rhodes (Ruffalo) into a total buffoon which makes the whole cat and mouse thing a bust. If you're going to use that angle, the opposing forces need to be equally matched, drawing out the suspense. Such was not the case here. And then you expect to see this group of talented actors shine, instead, it's like attempting to pull too many rabbits out of the hat. It's just a bunch of terrific actors who are totally restricted and undervalued. The draw of the film, The Horsemen, are given less screen time than expected and they're really the ones you want to see. Give me more Woody Harrelson!<br /><br />Now You See Me promises many things to the viewer but it never delivers upon those promises. It's not cerebrally challenging the way a magic movie should be. The twists and reversals weren't surprising and were completely unbelievable. You didn't see them coming, not because of skillful misdirection as was often implied, but rather because the explanations were crooked and expedient. Especially, near the end as we backtrack through the movie's big events, the reveals are less-than-convincing than if you were to simply believe in real magic. I'll take fantasy over the contrived solutions in this movie.<br /><br />Now You See Me, like most magic, is all smoke and mirrors with no real substance hiding behind the curtain. Basically, it's just one big pile of crap.<br /><br />Food for Thought: Now You See Me is a mix of Robin Hood meets The Prestige---only not quite so good. Sure, it's got all the misdirection that a magic movie should have, but much like bad magic, there's no integrity. Flashy, full of bells and whistles and big personalities, this movie has so much potential. Unfortunately, it completely fails in the execution, rendering it one of my biggest disappointments this year. If you want magic then you should watch The Prestige instead.xpected and they're really the ones you want to see.

B003NX76BM|4.0|Loved the story line, but would have preferred not having the bad language in there.  That kind of spoiled the fun of the story.
6302759110|3.0|Had Keanu Reeves in it and Anthoney Hopkins and other actors I liked but I didnt like the look of Dracula...I am just used to what I have always seen him as. But the story was done almost to the books I have read all my life. A little confused as to why he was inlove with Mina though...It's Lucy who was Dracula's love.
B008RA3X5E|5.0|Love it! Best clock/ alarm clock I've had.I can wake to my own music &amp; check the weather before getting out of bed.
B00E3VTR1K|5.0|Vampire queens and a shape-shifting mutant. The collection of stories was well written and left me wanting more. One story I liked reminded my of Robin Williams role in Bicentennial Man. A woman bored of hetero-relationships takes on a robotic partner. The growing relationship leads to her partner getting upgrades to graduate from male plaything to parental role model and best friend. Complex story themes and interesting characters.
B00CATSONE|4.0|Very easy reading and capsule of an amazing life. It inspired me to also read Nicola Tesla's &#34;My Inventions&#34; (also very easy to read and witty!) which prompted me to research Michael Faraday.... it's a great adventure and I'm enjoying it. This book started me off!
B00F8GYC1Y|4.0|Great game!  Much better than the 1st Star Wars graphics wise, but I've found the game tends to pixelate in a quite a few of the levels.  Slightly irritating when you're really getting into it.  Overall a great game but still in need of lots of new levels and fast!
075669812X|5.0|This totally fulfills my son's desires to be cool & tough - and to absorb countless pieces of minutiae about his favorite characters. I like it because it is a bit less violent than other similar series (Star Wars readers can be horrifying). It's also a nice, smaller size that makes it easier for my son to tote it around. Which he does. Almost everywhere he goes. Of course, like all other successful Lego franchises, it's a giant ad, but I'm picking the lesser evil here, I think.
B00EE3FVSU|5.0|Excellent acting and writing. The plot had so many twists that it left me wildly guessing after each episode. Great cinematography
B00F35BV64|2.0|This movie had some entertaining action. That having been said... Much of this film was hindered by its ill conceived plot and poor script. It replaces the intelligent social commentary science fiction with pithy dialogue and clever references without much substance. The cast is good highlighted by Simon Pegg and Karl Urban. The direction is fine. The film's flaws lie in its obligatory nature and it's lack of story.
B001KZG99A|4.0|I like the development and action packed adventures. I really liked the story line. Robert Downey Jr really is iron man.
B00DR0PDNE|4.0|Really nice, very simple to set up. It's very useful now, as one of the best ways to get Netflix or Youtube onto your TV. There's a lot of promises to get other apps to work with this, which if it happens, makes this an absolute essential gadget. The $35 price is genius, if you have any question as to if you want it, just get it. You won't be out much, and you might get a really killer experience in a few months.
B008RA3X5E|5.0|I really like this app.  Good alarm, easy to set, plenty of options.  It could be louder, but since the volume is dependent on the limitations of the Kindle 's volume level, I'll have to be satisfied.  Still a great little app.
B00ECU34ZM|4.0|I guess I gave my review away in the title.  I was thoroughly entertained while watching the movie, but there were a few twists and turns in the story that weren't well developed. Overall though, I would definitely recommend for a night in.
B008S4YZCO|5.0|The best monster game I have played on my kindle by far!!! Really fun game with great graphics too! Love this game. Amazing. DOWNLOAD IT RIGHT NOW!!!!! XD XD XD XD
B0031RS894|4.0|This is the best tenth Doctor quick reads that does not feature one of the seriers companions.  It was an interesting story and I felt the Sontarans were perfectly captured and the Doctor was written with an amazing brilliance that truly did justice to the character.  So for any Who fans out there this book will definitely be an enjoyable read.
B003MC5N28|5.0|I love this book!!!!  Omgosh. I couldn't put this book down. Defiantly going to read the rest of the series!!!!
B00EZZ77ZM|5.0|this album makes me feel warm and fuzzy inside. if you like feeling warm and fuzzy you should but it.
B0071XO8RA|5.0|When I read a book most of the times I feel like a spectator. I feel like I am watching a story unfold. I am completely into the story when I am reading but only when I am reading. Not with the complete Silo series. I found myself thinking about this world during the day. Daydreaming about the story and about the characters. Wondering what will happen next. Even now, weeks after reading Dust I still find myself thinking about that world. The story goes forward, backward, sideways and gives you more perspective and debt. I know I am not alone in this. I foresee people in colorful overalls and space suits in many events to come.
B00F8GYC1Y|4.0|Excellent game so far (probably about 30-40% in at this point) but really does need more levels to match previous Angry Birds games.  The new birds, like Yoda & the Emperor, have pretty neat special skills (if that's the term).  I look forward to more levels being released to fill out the game-it just feels too short at the moment-only reason I gave it 4 stars instead of 5.
B00DQVSTCG|1.0|I don't like the sound of [Blu-ray] version the DVD it's much better<br />After long waiting for the tour the copy is not what I expected<br />The MDNA TOUR was amazing but bad filming !!!!
B008C20TDG|5.0|The first book on food I have read that breaks things down in easy to understand terms/analogies. And the approach is a structure for success and gain, not rigid restriction. Anyone who takes this on for 30 days will benefit from getting to know their body, and their relationship to food. I love this book!!<br /><br />I am on a 60 day whole30, and it has been effortless. I am never hungry or tired. My energy is sustained throughout the day-I have lost 5% bodyfat (195 to 180lbs). And the food I make/eat is amazing. I don't feel like I am missing anything, only gaining a healthy, balanced, nutrient-dense lifestyle.<br /><br />Read this book, try it for 30 days, see for yourself.
B00ABGEFWC|5.0|this is a game for any age I am 19 and I love it I just need friends that's all so
B0047Y0FGY|3.0|I really got bored with it. Belong to a book club so I felt I needed to read it.  I did enjoy the last few chapter regarding her impersonation of Sarah Palin.
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|Good job Gameloft! This game is so creative; it's not like a lot of other &quot;run&quot; apps. Can't wait for updates! :)
B006QKKN14|3.0|It was ok but very predictable.  Liked the first movie and thought subsequent ones might be better.  Not!  Sorry, not worth it.
B00CWY76CC|5.0|Make me thank and work hard . I look for more rooms to came to work no and get out of hope it is soon.
B0036S4B6M|4.0|Better than the show but kind of bland.  Boring ending too. Watch Netflix show if you want drama and excitement,
B005ZB91KY|5.0|My son and I love this movie.  He will watch it everyday if I allow him to.  It is a great watch.
1400034205|5.0|I'd seen some of the movie - with Bill Murray - about a decade ago.  I'd been wanting to read the book since.  Just a fantastic work!  Lives from so many perspectives.  The characters are SO real.  I'm sad it had to come to an end.
B00F56AZK4|5.0|I love solving different types of puzzles. To me it's a great stress relief. The more the amount of puzzles on one picture the better it is for me.
B00AEFY3MC|5.0|This is an older movie, but the characters were a delight to watch.  The whole point of the movie addressed poor self esteem and how we don't fully realize our true character until we are put in very challenging situations.<br />This is well worth watching.
B00014TJ7K|5.0|Awesome!  The album left me feeling like I was on Cloud 9!! I would recommend this to any Beatles/George Harrison fan.  Thanks!
B00B2JSRAS|5.0|This is a HIGH flying book...:-)<br />The kind that reminds us all of what we have always known but have never dared put into practice. NOW is the time though. Because now is when we all want to feel good!!!<br />Not tomorrow not yesterday. But now...wherever we are
B00C7TAF3Y|5.0|I enjoy playing this game. Thank you for having a bit of help included. It does make you look at everything and think.
B008UCJ7KO|2.0|This book is a weak ripoff of 50 Shades of Grey except without the S and M. The other 2 books in the series are also the same. Very unbelievable or relateable.
B007BVOEPI|5.0|Greet book turned into a cool show, I'm very impressed with how they did. A must watch if you liked the books.
B00AZMFK3K|4.0|There's a LOT of reviews for this, so I'll just keep to my likes and dislikes and a summation point.<br /><br />LIKED-<br /><br />-demo material for video and sound, a stunner<br />-actors are fantastic<br />-very entertaining and fast-paced, never a dull moment<br />-risk-taking in it's narrative to revisit a classic Star Trek story from a different angle<br />-Uhura negotiating<br /><br />DISLIKED-<br /><br />-a noticeable lack of Dr. McCoy.  Karl Urban is a great character actor, he seemed side-lined in this film<br />-the hype, the 'no spoilers!' thing... having 'secrets' of the storyline which only serve to make reviewers, or anyone(!), look like bad guys when they wanted to explain why they thought something didn't work<br />-the plot.  It's a serious hot mess<br />-Lifting the dialog from the most famous scene from the Star Trek films, almost verbatim, as if the writers had just given up<br />-predictable face-punching finale<br />-Killing off my favorite secondary character<br /><br />PERSONAL OPINION-<br /><br />the best thing I can say about Into Darkness is that they made (after a long wait) a fun, fast-paced, good-looking summer blockbuster, and that there will be more Star Trek films to come.  That's a good thing!<br /><br />The worst thing I can say is that the cast and crew (and audience!) for these films are capable and deserving of a higher standard of writing.  The dramatic scenes in this film where the actors get to act?  They're OUTSTANDING.  Full of emotional depth!  But they're the filler in a hyper, Rube-Goldberg action story that keeps diverting you to some other thing, and gives you no time to digest what you're seeing, or get any sense of what the film is about.
B009DJB8I2|5.0|The tracks are really wonderful!<br /><br />Totally worth the money and Genuine Ap-Sap is a nice bonus for ones who plays TF2.
B00F91H666|4.0|This was overall a rather good zombie flick, fast zombies scare the crap out of me. On another note Brads co-stars were less desirable than one would have expected or hoped for. Could have been a bit more gore but all in all it was a good watch.
B000WGWQG8|5.0|This was a very interesting historical drama, and I have sent it as a gift to several friends.  I highly recommend it.
B0067Q42BY|5.0|Find this challenging and enjoyable. The music is decent and the levels flow together nicely. As always enjoy life and the games you play.
B009K916ZK|5.0|This adapter works perfectly, allowing me to connect my MacBook Pro to an older Dell monitor that is fairly large!  Now I have an extra display without having to shell out for a Mac Display!  The only irritating thing is that you go into full screen on one monitor, the other goes plank.  That being said it is only a minor inconvenience and has nothing to do with the cord itself, but rather the software.  Over all great product, I have been using for about 6 weeks now and have had no problems.  Only 30 bucks too!
B009LDD1X0|5.0|We have all of these and although crazy, we love the show. nerdy as the characters are.  If you enjoy the Big Bang Theory, this is a must have.
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|this is the best game ever. consider on buying it. they are so cute and definetly keep you entertained you wont be bored.
B005NJU8PA|5.0|I choose to rate this book with 5 stars because it has kept me entertained (and learning new things) for more than 3 weeks now. I have been just roaming around here and there, continually discovering new ideas.
B005ZOBNOI|4.0|I would recommend this book! So much emotion and love! It was heartbreaking but also heartwarming! It shows the other side of a horrible thing like cancer!
B008Y2FRFO|5.0|Love this game can't get enough just want to play play play want my &nbsp;ffriends to share the experience have fun y'all
B00A3AUGEW|4.0|I liked a couple of his songs, enough to make the $6 worth it.  The deluxe version seems to have quite a few more, but for a heftier price tag, so for the number I like I'm happy with it.
0345530578|5.0|an excellent read.  i have always enjoyed just about anything i can get my hands on by john grisham.  never disappoints!!
B00EVCD9HY|5.0|This album was awesome. I had no clue JM was so amazingly talented. BUY THIS ALBUM it will bring joy to your ears :)
B00ATDOVNK|4.0|This is a fun game. I have been playing hidden object games for a while now and this one doesn't disappoint. I would definitely recommend this.
B00B8M4IMK|5.0|Very reliable. I highly recommend, i use with I Phone 4 and Android - Google Nexus simultaneously, great value for the price!
B005JTAP4S|5.0|Everything seems to start off ordinary before suddenly Peter is sent on an interesting adventure. I was not expecting it to get as crazy as it did.<br />I loved the concept along with the memorable characters. The book flows at a rapid pace. Every page seems to take us to a new area along with introducing us to a new character.<br />It is a cute fantasy story with some extremely dark twists. It reminded me of Alice In Wonderland mixed with Adventure Time (without the annoying qualities that you would find in such a show). It makes me feel like I am in a strange and distorted dream world that keeps me on my toes.<br />Great escape book!
B003WUYRGI|4.0|The book was the stupidest thing I ever read if I ever wanted to be put to sleep by something I'd read this book
B008BM9L72|5.0|I was glued to the book from start to finish.  At the last page of the trilogy I almost felt that there should be more.  Great read.
0439023521|5.0|Its an amazing book! Makes you think about a lot of the stuff that goes on around us and what the future might come to. Got here within a couple days. Loved it !
B00DR0PDNE|5.0|This works great and was easy to set up. Just basically plug it into the HDMI port on your tv, plug in the USB power cord, and set up the wi-fi connection. This is a great Christmas present!
B001BKVWYG|5.0|I was introduced to his music by the DVD &#34;Searching for Sugarman&#34;. After seeing it, my wife and I were blown away by his talent and the fact that he was largely unknown in the U.S.
B005BGBPBG|4.0|Always enjoy watching this movie. It was great to get the free 24 hour rental with the purchase. Wish digital purchases were cheap like most dvds.
B001TCHDPS|5.0|I was introduced to his music by the DVD &#34;Searching for Sugarman&#34;. After seeing it, my wife and I were blown away by his talent and the fact that he was largely unknown in the U.S.
1250006341|5.0|While finishing up another book, I started reading this official companion book to the wonderful ITV series, both series 1 and 2.  I opted to buy the physical version to enjoy the photographs, a great decision on my part.  in addition to photographs from the series, you are also provided with the history the series exists in as well as behind the scenes articles.  They all serve to enhance your viewing experience.<br /><br />Anyone who is a fan of this terrific series needs to read and experience this book.  The events touched upon in the series are connected to the real historical people, places and events that inspired them.  A fan of history, I was delighted to not only learn more about the times the series is set in, but to gain a list of books to read and people to learn more about.  A definite 5 out of 5.
B009LDCZDC|2.0|Homeland is a great series and deserves 5 stars but not the DVD contents. We were looking forward to season 2 as we didn't have Showtime (we do now).  We ordered Season 2 BluRay and when opened the package, found no disc 3 but 2 disc 2's!
B0016OLC5Q|5.0|This movie definitely gives light on this generation and also gives light on what can truly happen in the wild. Smart young man that was driven for what he believed in
B004UID2LC|5.0|i just read a bunch of negative reviews about this app, but i have had it since december 2012 and have had no problems besides the fact that it will occasionally close in the middle of a search. i have tried other apps and have found nothing i like more than this. it downloads to the music section of my kindle and i can make playlists shuffle and search.  i guess i havent updated to the new version or whatever everyone is talking about because this is the best app and i would recomend it to everyone...
B0084IG8TM|4.0|The Hunger Games is the start of another franchise of movies based a series of teen books.  However, I did not think the movie was that bad, but actually quite good.  I do not think it is as good as the Lord of the Rings films, Narnia films, or the Harry Potter films, but still fairly enjoyable.  Compared to the string of teen fantasy movies that have come out recently like Percy Jackson or Twilight this movie is god.<br /><br />The story is pretty simple.  It takes place in the distant future.  There was once a big civil war which has left North America in ruins.  Instead of countries there now exists twelve districts.  Each year the capital of Panem forces either a boy or a girl from each district to compete in the Hunger Games where they all battle to the death.  From District 12 a girl named Katniss (Jennifer Lawrence) is chosen to compete along with her friend/love interest Gale (Liam Hemsworth).<br /><br />People accuse this film of ripping of another film called Battle Royale.  Firstly I have not seen Battle Royale so I cannot say which film is better.  Secondly, I'm sure that Battle Royale was not the first of its kind either.  Everything is inspired by something.  There have been movies and TV shows that have come out after this that have a similar premise of people put somewhere and are forced to fight to the death.  For all anime fans out there, there is an anime that came out last year (the same year that the Hunger Games came out) called Btooom that has pretty much the same premise yet I do not see many people complaining that that show ripped-off Battle Royale.<br /><br />Plus the film is still well structured, well, acted, and can be entertaining.  The characters are pretty solid.  I do like Katniss and it is easy to sympathize with her given the situation.  The stuff that she goes through is pretty scary and intense.  I can say that I would be dead in the first ten minutes if I was put in the Hunger Games.<br /><br />The movie has some great effects,decent actions scenes, and an interesting world.  I cannot comment on the 3D because I only saw the film in 2D.  There is one complaint I have and that is the middle portion.  I found much of the middle of the film to be kind of boring.  The middle mostly focuses of the political aspect of this world and preparing Katniss for the games.<br /><br />Overall, the Hunger Games was a pleasant surprise.  I did not expect much upon going to see it.  I basically saw it because my mother made me see it.  I have to admit it was much better than I thought it was going to be.  It was nothing incredible but it was still good.
B009KS4XRO|5.0|I enjoy this game much more than the human version. Lol. I like the variety of rooms and the chat ability is pretty cool too. I recently upgraded the dauber too. Coolio.:-)
B0034G4P80|5.0|Thor is the fourth superhero film in the Marvel Cinematic Universe.  To be honest, Thor is probably my favorite movie of the MCU so far, including the Avengers.  I even like this film more than Iron Man which was also a great film.  People are somewhat mixed on the film.  Some love it, while others do not care for it.  I personally really enjoyed this film.  I thought Chris Hemsworth was the perfect choice to play for like Robert Downey Jr. was the perfect choice for Iron Man.  Anthony Hopkins is brilliant like always.  Natalie Portman also gives a great performance.  The villain is a very cunning and very relatable villain.  The effects are amazing and the action scenes are awesome.<br /><br />The story is quite simple.  Long ago Asghard, led by Odin (Anthony Hopkins) fought an enemy known as the Frost Giants.  Asghard won the war.  Years later Frost Giants invade Asghard but are thwarted by Odin.  Our hero Thor (Chris Hemsworth) and his friends including his brother Loki (Tom Hiddleston) invade the Frost Giant homeland and pretty much start another war.  For his actions Odin banishes Thor to Earth in order to become a more mature person.  There he meets a girl named Jane Foster (Natalie Portman) and her family and because of them gradually grows as a person.  Then the main villain Loki sends forces to Earth to kill Thor he needs to regain his powers and defeat him.<br /><br />The story is basically a coming of age story.  The story is generic, but sometimes generic works.  I for one got invested into the Thor character and enjoyed following him on his journey.  The character of Thor is very arrogant and quick to anger in the beginning but not to the point where you do not like him.  As the film goes on he becomes more mature and humble and you really believe it.<br /><br />Natalie Portman does a great job here as well.  Natalie Portman, in the last five years has truly proven herself as a great actress.  She was given a bad name for the longest thanks to the StarWars prequels.  She was pretty bad in those movies, but that was more George Lucas's direction than anything.  People say that the stuff on Earth was fairly boring, but it was necessary.  The stuff on Earth is there to make Thor grow as a character.  Natalie's character was definitely necessary in that.  I do agree, however, that the scenes on Earth could have been a bit shorter.<br /><br />The villain Loki is also great.  Of all the villains in these Marvel movies in this universe, I think that Loki is the best one, at least in this movie.  He is made into more of a generic bad guy in the Avengers, but here you really buy his motivations.  You find out that he is actually the son of Asghard's enemy.  Plus, Odin always held Thor in higher regard than him and he wanted to prove himself.  You do not condone what he does but you see where he is coming from.<br /><br />The effects of this film are Breathtaking.  Though I like the Earth stuff for the most part I just love when they are in Asghard or in the Frost Giant realm.  The CGI is simple beautiful.  The action scenes are also great particularly the one where Thor and his friends fight the Frost Giants in their realm in the beginning of the film.  I did not see the film in 3D so I cannot comment on that.<br /><br />Overall, Thor is a great coming of age story.  Before this movie came out I would have never thought that Thor could work in live action.  However, this film and the Avengers definitely proved me wrong.  If you are a fan of the Thor comics or are just a fan of the MCU them definitely check this out.  Hopefully Thor 2 will be just as awesome if not more so.
B00785P2QC|5.0|I really enjoy the game. You should add more map extensions and make airports to travel to friends cities. Also allow for friends
B0090P98Z4|4.0|its worth it to get it for those times when your extremely bored,  very much like diablo or games of that nature

B002BI6SMI|5.0|I chose this rating because I believe it sends a much needed message to parents and children alike.  Things like those portrayed in this movie do happen.  If seeing this movie can save one child from being abducted it is well worth the five star rating.
B00DOPEGAS|5.0|It is extremely fun and you don't have to be crafty to make a bracelet! It is very creative. Highly recommended.
B005D9MUWY|5.0|This has to be the best keyboard I've ever used in a phone. Much better than swype and the standard Samsung keyboard. Unbelievable that it has taken this long to get this quality out of an android keyboard,  but at least we have it now.
B00D7Z4GQY|5.0|This author writes very well and keeps the interest of the reader. I highly recommend the book. The comments about relationships are deep and obviously the result of real life experience.
B007R3AZNK|4.0|It was good but I don't think I would buy it if I heard it first.  Just not what I expected.
B0090P98Z4|4.0|It is a good game with very few bugs. The only problem is that unless you want to spend 100+ you won't get very far. Items it suggests you buy for the first-ever cost roughly 10 I can't get far into second dungeon due to the mobs being too powerful than your gear can handle. So it is free but if you really want to play be prepared to spend hundreds.
B006AZZPCM|1.0|every time the updates it logs me out and when I log me in, it won't let me back in
B006LSZECO|5.0|Wow.  Such a clever book.  Great story.  Great writing.  I quite literally had a very hard time putting it down.
B002IVLH60|5.0|I purchased this cd for the song Just breathe, from the movie Life As We Know It. That song is so special to anyone if you have lost anyone that is dear to you. It is beautiful
B00D2HTRVQ|5.0|My daughter (3yrs) loves to help around the house, but obviously I can't let her swing a real hammer, so she loves being able to &#34;fix&#34; things in this game.
6305428042|5.0|Absolutely love it!!!Loved it as a kid and love it as an adult. Can't wait to own it on DVD instead of VHS
0739375970|1.0|This audio CD does not do justice at all to the story. Every man portrayed sounds like a pirate with a bad cold, and about 70 years old regardless of the age of the character.  If the voice is not an old phlegmy pirate it is the voice of a dumb cockney street urchin. Dotrice robs the female characters of all depth and meaning. I have listened to all the audio books of this series and all suffer, but this is by far the worst. A new reader for this series is badly needed.<br />As far as the book itself, I confess I want to see this story to the end but this is way to dragged out and slow. The book plods along interspersed with important and or exciting events only rarely. Could be so much better. Perhaps I will take the HBO route instead.
B001XRLWPQ|5.0|I love the series and so does my grandson.  I buy these for him to watch since he missed the first 4 seasons.
B0013TXA5Y|5.0|I loved this book it's amazing. My eyes were literally  hooked on the book, it was like I couldn't stop reading it. That's how good it was.<br />I chose 5 stars because of how great the book was, and because of how much I loved reading it.  I like the book because of the way it was written and because of how I kinda couldn't stop reading it.  I would recommend this book to people who are 13 & older because I'm 13 and I really enjoyed reading this book.
B00EAH3GHI|5.0|Just got this &#34;Live and Loud&#34; DVD in the mail and it's awesome. I must say that only saw it once when it originally aired and have seen a few random clips on Youtube...but those clips don't compare. The picture and sound quality on this DVD is top notch and a must have for any Nirvana fan. Great buy and I received it super fast because I pre-ordered it.
B003FCVF6I|4.0|In the same vein as [[ASIN:B003PDMKIY Steven Levy's \\"Hackers\\"]], the author reviews the history of video games, citing numerous written sources, from \\"Spacewars\\" to Xbox. However, there's also many biased views, some technical gaffes and more than one uncited source of gossip. So, be warned that this is a journalistic account of the history of video games, written by a journalist and to a broad audience. It is not a rigorous historical account following a scientific method, like [[ASIN:B003VPWY2I Paul Cruzi's \\"A History of Computing\\"]] but provides a compelling and entertaining read and since it was published it has become a constant source of anecdotes cited in other works. Also it ignores completely the rich history of European video games and the contributions made to the art and the industry by machines like the Sinclair computers or the MSX.<br /><br />Sadly, the historical account of this industry has yet to be written.
B0031RS42K|5.0|I didn't put this book down until I was finished it. It took me about 2 days as I do have to spend some time working as well.<br /><br />A very interesting story, although a little bit predictable like most Dan Brown novels (none of the protagonists every really have any major issues).
B000NYT1M6|5.0|He found it before his birthday and knew right away it was for him.  Loves playing with it in his new sandbox his daddy made for him.
B002VWNIAY|5.0|loved this movie for so many yrs. thanks for having it..\\however it is a very difficult time<br />ordering these two movies as the people who answer the phone do not understand<br />english and i cannot understand them
0783226063|3.0|I would have given it more stars, except it is Widescreen.  I hate widescreen but it seems as if they are only selling movies that way.
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|Super fun...I love it...my kids love it!!! Long hours of playing and enjoyment. Many fun challenges and obstacles to work through.
B007XF4J70|5.0|There not much more I can say about this movie that already hasn't been said.  It not call the greatest love story for nothing.  I can watch it over and over.  I love it.
0060775858|4.0|I am giving this four stars instead of five because I truly hate this book so couldn't give it five. I think it is boring and the pictures are uninteresting. However my 11 month old daughter fell in love with this yard sale find the first time I read it to her when she was 5 months old.  It is the only book she loves nothing else keeps her interest. We read this every single night to the point I have memorized it. But her face lights up each time I start with \\"In a great green room\\" and she smiles from ear to ear so I continue to read this stupid book. My husband and mother both equally hate this book but since I read it for my daughter and she loves it that is all that matters. :) We also have the IPAD app version of this book. So be forewarned you may hate this book but find yourself reading it every night just to make your child happy.
B00DAPOHU6|5.0|jack keeps on delivering what we love. here's to a great artist who knows how to communicate the little things in such a great way!
0805047905|4.0|My daughter loves when I read this book. I \\"sing\\" it to her while I read it in an upbeat voice and she smiles and claps. The pictures and story are simple and the length is just right for a young child. The board book is perfect for little fingers to turn the pages and no need to work about the book being torn up.
B000EQ47GS|5.0|Exactly as advertised. At one heck of a price! Going back to buy more CDS of Boston and other groups.
0452295548|5.0|Excellent description by the scientist author of stroke and recovery.  Very readable, educational, and appropriate for medical or non-medical persons.
B0067TQQI8|5.0|I purchased the Anker portable power pack for my long flight to Europe. It was the perfect item to pack. It is a little bulky but for the mAH I wanted it would have to be. Even after my trip I carry it in my purse everyday. It's nice to have when an outlet isn't available. I can charge my iPhone four times and almost fully charge my iPad before having to charge the power pack. An extra plus about it is the extra pieces for other devices and the handy carrying case. I would highly recommend this product.
B007ZGO7EM|5.0|The large &#34;buttons&#34; make it easy to use with your fingertip instead of using a stylis.  Ease of use was the foremost attribute that I appreciated.  Having been in accounting for over 28 years, this FREE calculator is a real asset for home use.
B00915G6MG|5.0|It certainly kept me on the edge of my seat.  Especially the season ender.  Now I have to wait for the next season to find out what happens.  Little worried about the new person they are bringing on board to replace Ziva.  Don't know if I am going to like her or not.  Guess I'll have to wait and see.
B00DYOOGYK|5.0|If u like gta get this well the game is good I myself haven't beat it yet buying is so much easier for u pirates I used to be a pirate
B00D7Z4GQY|1.0|This novel has so many characters in it, I became physically ill trying to keep up with them.  I had knots in my stomach trying to figure out who was who, who was married to who, who cheated on who...it was just awful.  It literally made me mad.  Just save your money.
B001AQR3MQ|5.0|WE ENJOYED IT, BUT AFTER THE FIRST HALF OF THE MOVIE, IT STARTED GETTING STRANGE!  BUT IT DID MAKE YOU WONDER ABOUT WHAT HEAVEN WILL BE  LIKE.  WELL DONE.
B00000I8UJ|5.0|This is desert-island stuff for me. Dex just seems to be having such a great time. This is one to listen to when you're in a good mood, or really need to GET into a good mood.
B00B7Y0206|5.0|If you like YouTube, add this app to your collection. It's free, and works great. Always up-to date, new videos added daily. you can find what you're looking for, and I've not had any problems playing any of the video clips yet.  I recommend this app.<br />Pros: great app for your collection<br />Cons: none so far
B004U7JYXS|5.0|My granddaughter has the camera and was thrilled with the additional film. The instant pics are a lot of fun.
B00985E3UG|4.0|I honestly had a hard time putting this book down.  It does a fantastic job of outlining how the food industry evolved and coerced the American Public into eating poorly.<br /><br />If consumers choose to purchase and feed their families processed foods -- even foods that market themselves as healthy foods, our collective health will continue to go downhill.<br /><br />At least we will go downhill with  our eyes wide open.  I am much more careful of what I purchase, and lean now toward the outside aisles of the grocery store where food items are somewhat less processed.
B009KS4XRO|5.0|This game is addicting and its nice to be able to play it on my kindle. A nice way to pass time.
B004EPYZQC|5.0|Will watch anything with Vin  Diesel in it and Dwayne (Rock) Johnson is pretty funny at times. Good movie, great price.
B00AE9UYJ4|4.0|This is a really great game for any slender games out their for tablet other reviews on other games they have low ratings and this app well for any slender apps out there deserves a lot more stars.  It is worth the money it is a well done game.  Terrifying and chilling. 2spooky4me
B00A81NFAS|5.0|This is one of those movies you can watch over and over again.  I never get tired of seeing this.
B008Y2FRFO|5.0|I LOVE IT, I LOVE IT, I LOVE!!!!!!!!!!!!!  I've played a lot of games but this beats them all. VERY FUN, RELAXING & ADDICTIVE .  I have completed and won all the priz<br />es in the the arcade games.  I was on level like 198 &had over 13,000 coins. Yesterday I shut my game down &  when I turned it back on, it was like it reset back the very beginning, level 1.  Don't know if there a limit you can  reach before starting over, does anybody know?
B00BIVN82M|5.0|Love anything Michael Buble does. If you enjoy listening to him, you'll love this collection of songs. Three more words.
B00B7Y0206|4.0|I give this app 4 stars 'cause of all the pauses. If there was not a lot of pauses than i would give it five stars. This is a very helpful app, and if you are a kid and you don't have Disney, but you want to watch Disney, then this shows the full episodes first and not just a bunch of parts that aren't all there. If i could i would give it 4 &amp; 1/2 stars. BTW this is the longest review i have ever written so that probably means it's good.
B005OCFHHK|4.0|My one grandson is reading all the Harry Potter books, so his parents let him watch each of the movies after he's read the book.
0553296981|5.0|This book is a good book it gives details of Anne's life<br />and it also has pictures of where she lived.<br />I recommend this book for children as well as adults<br />Amazon did a great job on delivery.
0553381407|1.0|I used to believe all of this stuff, I felt I was a toxic parent and now since my own kids do not talk to me, I can only see false truths in this, I went for help everywhere and listened to every therapist and doctor possible and to learn a CT scan and MRI were not invented, and to think how messed up the mental health system is, to think the author puts all the blame on the parent without medical care is totally wrong, I went with an undiagnosed brain injury that was 17 years old and still learning about my TBI and went to counselors like this author who put all the blame on me, and to teach the children it is all the parents fault, they did not do enough, when are the professionals going to step up to the plate for improper diagnoses, lack of medical care and technology to help a parent help the child, I always felt I knew there was something wrong with me, but went to a Doctor, ummmmm. and to think my daughter read your book, maybe her first step would be to learn more about our parents mental illness or brain injury.
0062511408|5.0|I loved this book in English. Now my aim is to read it in Spanish. I can't wait!<br /><br />A mi me gusta muchísimo este libró en inglés. Entonces mi proyectó ahora es lo leer en español. No puedo esperar!
B00AIQP9DE|4.0|The game's got good, but, it has to be free of charge due to it's simple gameplay although, it does have a good story.
B00A8MGIZG|5.0|This is one of the few movies that is better than the book.  The movie retains the six different styles and languages of each of the six storylines from the books, but the decision to intersperse the six stories works better than the chronological approach of the books.  I especially enjoyed the actors plying multiple roles across the storylines.
1451648537|5.0|Aside from the hype I thought Walter did a great job of telling Jobs' story....warts and all. I thought this was a great read and will keep it in my collection.
B008YWY0HK|3.0|This is another wonderfully made movie from Pixar/Disney. The animation is outstanding, the actors picked for voices are well known and do an outstanding job, but the story is so weak as to make the movie trivial. The plot centers around a tomboy princess who wants to have her own identity and follow her own desires and of course her own life. This is a good opening, but the story degenerates into a farce about a magic potion that turns her mother into a bear, and the resultant senseless chaos. The only forceful, believable characters in the story are the protagonist (Merida, the Princess) and her mother,(Elinor the Queen). Every single man in the story is portrayed as a buffoon and/or vulgar slob, including her father. Who was Merida ever going to marry? None of the men in the entire kingdom are worthy of even a first glance. The craziness of her mother being bewitched goes on too long, and the moviegoer feels only relief when Elinor finally is returned to her own form. Masterfully done by the best animation house in the world, but could have been a much better movie with a stronger plot and a more profound story.
B009LDCXNY|5.0|Started watching season 6.  Had to go back to the beginning.  I am glad I did.  Best series on TV. Yes I think so.
B00A2H9OZS|4.0|When I first saw \\"Pitch Black\\" I thought it was just okay. I certainly didn't think it was director David Twohy's best work. A subsequent viewing looked a lot better to me. But I'm still surprised it sprouted not one but two sequels. The latest \\"Riddick\\" is more like \\"Pitch Black\\" than \\"The Chronicles of Riddick.\\"<br /><br />Here's the scoop. Riddick comes to on some unforgiving planet. He's got a compound fracture on one leg and a multitude of bruises and whatnot. He's also surrounded by creatures who look at him as though he's their next meal. He puts himself back together and activates a beacon at an outpost that draws the attention of two sets of bounty hunters. They want his hyde. He wants one of their ships. A storm brews that will awaken more monsters and make the two parties dependent upon one another.<br /><br />This is a somewhat different approach in that we see a Riddick that isn't always on top off things. An adversary gets the jump on him which is how we come to see him in his beat up state at the beginning of the flick. It's also more leisurely paced that the twp previous outings. Twohy takes time when letting Riddick mend himself, settle down and then domesticate one of the local canines. But this is some nasty stuff. I actually had to turn my head a couple of times, like when he puts his leg back together and again when he immunizes himself against the venom of one of the indigenous nasties. But when the bounty hunters arrive we see the old Riddick who is always a step ahead of his foes and it's fun. Twohy did a nice job with the hunters. They are better written than one usually finds in this kind of movie. The one odd exception was Bokeem Woodbine's character.  He was little more than a sketch and gets killed in a rather unceremonious fashion. Katee Sackhoff, of Star Trek fame, is on hand as a butt kicking sharp shooter who gets warm for Riddick's form. But it's all pretty cool. Riddick gets to do what he does best, which is to dispense people. Andthe tenuous bond he forms with the leader of one of the hunter groups plays pretty well.<br /><br />This is no great flick by any means, but for those who like the franchise, or this kind of movie in general, it delivers the goods in spades.
B0000524CY|5.0|Saw this when it first came out in 1973.  I've seen monster movies and slasher movies all my life and gotten accustomed to them.  This one bothered me.  It creeped me out .  Now, after seeing this version with added scenes, it creeped me out all over again.
B005LN5UOC|2.0|I bought this headset based on the numerous positive reviews, but was a bit disappointed when I tried it out. It does work and you can communicate with your friends, but they sound muffled and distant. The other players didn't complain about not being able to hear me, so I suppose that's a plus.<br /><br />I've been gaming for years and have used a variety of headsets for the Xbox 360 and the PS3 ranging from the standard Xbox mic to the blue tooth PS3 headset to a few Turtle Beach headsets. This headset is by far the worst I've used. I suppose you get what you paid for. I would recommend spending a bit more and buying a better headset than this one.
B009KS4XRO|5.0|This is a great game to play. Fun easy app. No way you won't love this if you love bingo.
B00D6QU6RW|5.0|Brought back memories of time spent with my daughter and the concerts we attended together. Just saw them in concert and they were awesome.

B00DR0PDNE|5.0|Crystal clear viewing and very easy to use. I love how small and portable it is. I love how you can cast from a laptop, PC, iPhone or iPad, etc. Can't wait for more apps to be compatible with it.
B00992CF6W|5.0|This is a great game don't get me wrong. There are only two things that I would like to suggest,1 add carts/rails, 2 set up some mode that you can follow the story or use mods
B00DR0PDNE|4.0|I do like it and it will be great for watching YouTube on the TV.  I already have Roku so the NetFlix is no benefit to me.  I was really expecting to be able to put what is on Chrome on my iPad / iPhone on the TV but that is not possible at this point.<br /><br />The only way to cast internet content is from a PC/Mac with the Cast extension installed.  There is no Cast extension for mobile devices.<br /><br />Setup was a little problematic.  I have three wireless access points and it would only connect to one (the closest one thankfully) and I kept getting errors trying to connect to the others.<br /><br />I am impressed with the image / video quality so far.
B005BRS8Z6|4.0|I enjoyed this book tremendously. I wish it had more practice examples and \\"how to\\", other than that It is truly eye-opening
140006922X|5.0|A very interesting, if flawed, look at the historical Jesus. Aslan is a very well versed and<br />knowledgeable scholar. His overview look at this topic may lack depth in places, but it is<br />a very interestingly done and well written work. Offers some real insights and may encourage the<br />reader to further reading/research.

1451629192|5.0|I had a hard time putting down this book.  It was sad to read but so frank.  I read it because I am always fearful that one of my kids will be kidnapped. I think it gave some good advice and am looking into some programs she suggests for schools.
B00B3L3RPA|5.0|Mary Shelley calls to question numerous themes in her novel. Chiefly, the misery and fellowship of man as well as the conscience of science and the duty of a creator to the being he has created. A truly worthy read.
1451695195|2.0|If you already believe in heaven which I do then this book was just a long winded OK story.  But it was nice to see how his family didn't give up when doctors were suggesting they needed to pull the plug.
B009KS4XRO|3.0|Fun game but at times a bit frustrating. Have lost credits and not gotten rewards. Enjoy playing very day. Find friends on Facebook an  get more credits.
0375826742|5.0|I read the whole series to my daughter as bedtime stories.  The books have 600-800 pages each so it took us about a year.  We were disappointed at the end of the 4th book - kind of like Peter Pan reaching and staying in Neverland.  The ending was a let down. But maybe that will change with another book although the fourth book is supposed to be the last. There were many made up names of people and places that we weren't sure to pronounce.  The writer was so detailed and descriptive that you could visualize the book.  I often stopped and talked to my daughter about the ways he used some of the descriptive phrases.  Every once in a while it was too descriptive so it seemed the plot was moving too slow especially in Book 4.<br /><br />My daughter learned so much from this series:  lots of new vocabulary and especially the importance of descriptive phrased in writing.  She really liked it that the author wrote this while he was in high school.  It helped her believe in herself more and she even wrote a 150 page book whle we were reading this.
B004XJRQUQ|5.0|All 3 of these books are exciting and unpredictable making you want to read them all! I got so addicted i read all 3 books in 2 days! CRAZY!!<br />Recommend everyone reads this. It appeals to teenagers as well as older readers! Love it !
1423140605|5.0|I love reading novels to my daughter at bedtime and she loves listening.  We have about 30 pages to go but this has been a great novel. We have already read the other books in this series and it almost seems that it was written by a different author since his style of writing was a little different.  Percy Jackson and friends are now in their late teens (I think) and are using the hip language of my daughter and her friends.  I think this added a nice touch.
B00F2362IE|2.0|My son has been waiting for this game to come out so we were very excited to purchase it.  However, the game is constantly locking up and the kindle has to be rebooted for it to work again.  I am not impressed!
B00354Y9ZU|3.0|In this age in which we are expected to follow standard operating procedures, report every minute of our working lives and stay away from what is not supposed to be in &#34;our box&#34; so that &#34;inteligent&#34; people at the control tower decide on what to do, this makes for some interesting thinking.
B008JGSM6G|4.0|I downloaded this game on my Kindle for my 3 year old daughter. It keeps her entertained and the easy levels are simple for her to follow without getting frustrated. There's levels that are a bit herder for my 1st grader, and I play sometimes too! It's one of those games that you don't have to think a lot, its just simple entertainment.
B0040I09RM|4.0|Forget what you think you know about motorcycle clubs, especially the hard riding Harley riders! This deceptively simple series is full of complex characters and nail biting drama.
B00F8H0LM2|5.0|This is my 6 year old's favorite game on my phone or Kindle! There are a lot of different levels to unlock and the sound effects and graphics keep him interested. My 3 year old even likes it!
B005SAYRA6|3.0|A lot of great action with fast cars.  Seemed a bit lame with the plot.  Better to have watched it at home than in the theater though, glad I waited for the digital version.
B007IXWL2C|4.0|I enjoyed reading this series. It was captivating...very kinky and erotic! But it also had a good storyline that kept you interested.

B000JMKQX0|5.0|I really enjoyed reading different perspectives of the people that went through the war. Similar to the movie but more informative. Actually nothing like the movie .
B004EBZX6W|4.0|I have not had to use it much. From what I have used it I did like it. I am sure when I need it and use it more I will love it. It is free so no complaints.
B00ECUARO8|3.0|This isn't a great movie, but it was worth the price to watch it. Good performances by most of the cast.
0307476073|5.0|Strayed's journey to self-acceptance along the Pacific Crest Trail is raw, frightening, and gorgeous. Her character is raw and flawed. Her journey is frightening. Her writing is gorgeous. This memoir is so honestly written it took my breath away. Strayed finds healing and self-acceptance at the end of her journey. Readers of Wild will too.

B0081336FO|5.0|If you've not watched this version of Sherlock and you like the character, you are missing out. One of the better shows on TV. The episodes are a little long at 90 minutes, but then you don't feel as cheated only getting 3 episodes a season. Highly recommend!

1401324649|5.0|Being 72 and not a friend of big parties, I can identify completely with Allan Karlsson. The book has the right mixture<br />of information, story-telling, and suspense that a VERY readable novel requires. I recommend this book very strongly<br />to all approaching the twilight of their lives. It makes the evening much more pleasant.

B00F6NKFQK|5.0|The stories in this book are not only funny: they are clever and witty. The author, Oleg Medvedkov, lets his characters loose so they spring from a model in literature such as Attila the Hun or the Minotaur, only to change our perception of them.<br /><br />For example, Minotour Chronicles is a twist on the mythological tale of the Minotaur, the part man part bull monster born to the King of Crete, who devours human victims in the labyrinth. But in this retelling, the Minotaur is utterly astounded at the dread of his visitors: &#34;My understanding is that I am a tourist guide. So when tourists come, I should greet them and talk about the labyrinth and its history and such. But they usually scream and run away.&#34; &#34;Dude,&#34; he says to his attacker, in a endearingly naive way, &#34;easy with the sword. You can hurt someone, you know.&#34;<br /><br />In Why I want to conquer Paris, Attila enumerates his nonsensically witty reasons. The nuggets of humor keep coming on phrase after another: &#34;as all of my 450 wives would agree, I am an incurable romantic,&#34; followed by, &#34;Although, being a hypochondriac, I am wary of things that are incurable,&#34; followed by, &#34;Note to self: ask my dearests to come up with a better term of endearment for me.&#34;<br /><br />Oleg Medvedkov keeps mixing it up, changing the format of his stories, which keeps the reader on her toes. While the first two stories are in the first voice narrative, The Fall of Troy: How it really happened is a play set on the wall of Troy, starring three Trojan guards who check their manuals for any instructions that may be relevant to what they face: a giant horsey. Giant Squirrels is presented as a letter to Abigail, and Random Excerpt from the US army Field Manual on Dealing with Time Travelers from the So-Called &#34;Roaring Twenties&#34; is exactly as the name implies, with a touch of matter-of-fact, serious wackiness.<br /><br />It is not only the versatile format that keeps things fresh, but the creative ways in which the author, Oleg Medvedkov, brings together past and present. Ancient tales get dusted off to make them a starting point for present day adventures, told with a chuckle.<br /><br />Five stars.<br /><br />This book was sent to me gratis for an unbiased review.author, Oleg Medvedkov, brings together past and present.

0763639184|2.0|I thought it would be interesting to buy a book full of different fish with lively images to read to my boy.<br /><br />He is 15 months now. Introduced this book when he was11 months .till now he still give the cant be bothered look when I bring out this book.<br /><br />Absolutely no interest and doesn't even want to look at the book where as other books of similar subjects can interest him much better!
B008JMKN4Y|5.0|I won a signed paperback copy of this book in return for an honest review. This was an amazingly fascinating and addicting love story. I loved the strong willed characters and their individual personalities. This book had me addicted from beginning to end and I had a lot of trouble putting it down because I just had to know about the next big secret in the story. This is a YA story that will entice you to want to read it and fall in love with the plot line and characters just as I have done. I love sitting here and reminiscing about my favorite parts of the story. This is a emotional roller-coaster of a story that will suck you in heart and soul and lock you there til the end.  I highly recommend this phenomenal story and the writing style that this author shows us in this book. This book has earned it's 10+*s.
1590171993|5.0|I had been aware of Stoner for many years and felt guilty that I hadn't read it.  Stoner is a classic portrayal of a very good human being, little regarded by his colleagues because of his quiet and dignity. Should be required reading in lit classes.

B00EI6E17A|5.0|Over the last couple of years, I have gotten music off commercials. I happen to love the Kia hamster commercial, and this song is just so darned catchy. It's in my head all the time. I also love the Gatorade commercial featuring Jake Bugg's &#34;Lightning Bolt&#34;.
0694003611|5.0|I read this to my 2 year old son every night until he moved on to this next book. I still know it by heart so when we are somewhere without a book I can recite this to him and it calms him down right away. He loves the part where the old lady whispers \\"Hush\\" and always likes to say \\"hush\\" with me.
B00DXP7L88|2.0|\\"Dexter\\" went from being one of the greatest shows on television to one of the worst. And it pains me to say this, but the series finale was quite possibly the worst in TV history. Seriously. The \\"Seinfeld\\" finale is golden compared to this one.<br /><br />I feel that \\"Dexter\\" went steadily downhill after Season 4, which admittedly was so freaking fantastic that it would be next to impossible for anything else to measure up. However, Season 8 was by far the worst of all. The Dr. Vogel plot was weak and a terrible way to wrap up what was once a great series. Let's just get to the finale, which is the absolute worst thing about this season. (Warning: massive spoilers ahead.)<br /><br />1. I had this feeling that Deb's character would meet an unfortunate end, but it really seemed unnecessary here. Does everyone in the show have to be miserable at the end?<br /><br />2. Hannah is now raising Harrison in Argentina. Really? Would it have been so awful to have Dexter flee Miami and at least leave Harrison with Deb? (And, you know, keep Deb alive?) And how is Hannah raising Harrison a good idea? Need I remind everyone that she is a serial killer also? Maybe of a different breed than Dexter, but still. What about his grandparents, Rita's parents? Dexter never thought that Harrison might be better off in the care of his family and siblings? And isn't anyone going to wonder what happened to Harrison after Dexter is declared dead? No one will think he was out on that boat. Dexter never would have taken Harrison out in a hurricane. Hmm.<br /><br />3. I don't think Deb ever fully resolved her \\"I am in love with my brother\\" issues. They were revealed at the end of Season 6, and then it's like the writers went, \\"Yeah, that was weird. Let's just not talk about it and pretend it never happened.\\"<br /><br />4. The whole Dexter dumping Deb's body in the water was odd to say the least. I kept waiting for Harry's apparition to return and say something like, \\"I know you don't need me anymore, Dexter, but I'm back to tell you that even I don't know what the heck you're trying to do right now!\\"<br /><br />5. I was so sure that the finale would wrap up with Matthews letting Dexter off the hook somehow, and with Dexter learning that Matthews was somehow in on everything via Harry from the very beginning. The show even set it up to be that way over the past couple of seasons, but then nothing happened with that at all. Same with all the other supporting characters. I get that the show was mainly about Dexter, but the audience received zero closure on everything else.<br /><br />6. That final scene...you know, the one where Dexter is now Wolverine?! I guess I understand the self-imposed exile, after what happened to Deb. However, the last few episodes leading up to the finale were all about Dexter remarking on how he didn't even really have the urge to kill anymore, and he just wanted to spend time with his new family and build a life with them. I don't understand how all that vanished after Deb, and how abandoning his son seemed like the only way to go.<br /><br />So there you have it. I am still reeling after watching the finale and am super bummed. I feel like the producers really let the audience down. Dexter himself let me down, too. He just kind of threw in the towel at the end. So un-Dexterlike, and not at all what his sister Deb would have wanted.ore, Dexter, but I'm back to tell you that even I don't know what the heck you're trying to do right now!\\"<br /><br />5.

B0050DIWFC|4.0|As a parent, I found this book to be emotionally gripping.  It felt very real and made me think in terms of how I would deal with such an awful issue with my own child.
B00CH87HF4|5.0|This game has great graphics and some 'challenging' challenges. This is a fun game, and its well worth the price! If you liked DH2, you'll really enjoy this!
B00D6SBOWG|5.0|Got this game on a whim, and glad I did! This game is more than just solitaire, with a cute underlying plot. Graphics are great, game is easy to get the hang of (if you've never played solitaire before), and I find it quite addicting. A great game for passing the time!
B00005JKES|5.0|Both fans and non-fans alike will enjoy the murder mystery at Twin Peaks.  The music score, quirky characters, and moody settings of the Pacific Northwest add to the viewer's  enjoyment.  The very first episode is missing due to a legal ownership problem, but that is not really much of an issue, even if you have never seen the show.  There is a previous episode trailer at the beginning of episode 2 to fill you in.  At the beginning of each episode, the introduction to the story by the &#34;Log Lady&#34; has been left out, for some reason.  She is on the discs however, and you can see them played at the beginning of the episode by looking at the alternative features menu.  There are other features as well including commentary and script notes.  The packaging of the DVD's is attractive and sturdy.  All in all, it is a nice diversion.
B000HKYOK0|5.0|Interesting intro, learned some new facts about the show.  Didn't realize Spock was the only original character.  Enjoyed watching the show.
B0010YSD7M|5.0|After the end of the SG1 series, we were left with a few loose ends to the final story lines.  The big question was how were the Ori going to be defeated?  This film answers the question.  The production values and special effects are high quality.  There is plenty of action.  There are some old enemies, and special surprises as well!  The film is watchable by non-fans of Stargate as well.  It stands alone well.  For Stargate fans, it is a must view.
B002SHD9E2|5.0|I liked it the first time I saw it, and still do. Was able to see things this time around that I missed the first time.  I like having the info window that drops down.
B0000669JL|5.0|Thank you so much, great CD!!! What a great addition to my cd collection. I can listen to this all day long.
B008IJTFYW|5.0|This is an easy to use , relaxing app that we use every night for a restful sleep. It is wonderful.!
B001IYCMNA|2.0|The device work great for about a year then it became drop city.  The loss of connection started out as just on occasion for short moments then steadily increased in frequency and duration until needing replacement.
B00ESY7QXI|3.0|For those of you who have never seen the Robert Redford version, then you may have enjoyed this movie without any angst. As they say ignorance is bliss... For those of us who have had the pleasure of seen the original version then you would have abhorred the flashy transitions, the use of hip hop that destroyed the feel of the 1920s time period, and the very obvious lack of dialogue development. The flashy transitions was completely relied upon in this new version to tell a story that is meant to be told with all the nuances of emotions, so at the end you can really feel for Gatsby and can grasp the end of an era. The old version did that, but the new version's story line fell flat for me.
B008764ZQ4|5.0|Great song, when performed by both the actors and the real bands.<br />Cute movie.  I think it was a scary truth about how people (industry people anyway) treat Tom Cruz.
B007TBZ63Y|5.0|Usually authors lose it by there 8th book about the same thing Rick Riordan has not. He continues to teach people greek mythology while entertaining them!!! Luv it read read each book twice tots luv it
B00AOMR2S2|5.0|Good Music, sexy cast, and a nice little storyline, too.<br />I love good music, and playback the &#34;Riff Off&#34; time after time.
B007J4T2G8|3.0|Honestly I read this book to see what all the fuss was about, soft porn is about it, just a thought but maybe IF the author had  read, Jane Eyre, pride and prejudice, sense and sensibility not to mention the history of Henry XIII, maybe able to bring more depth to the characters. However IF soft porn and sensationalism was what the author was only wanting to achieve in this case they did just that.
B00BEZTMFY|4.0|I was pleased with the acting and the representation of the key plot elements of the original books.  Not to mention the production values.<br /><br />That said, unlike LOTR, there isn't really three movies worth of material in the Hobbit.  Peter made up for this a little by working in Tolkien content from other stories and from staging scenes and events that take place \\"off camera\\" in Tolkien's works.  I was okay with that, too, even the silly parts like the rabbit sled and Saruman's prevarication.  But scenes that took only a few pages in Tolkien went on and on and on. Scenes like the dwarf takeover of Bilbo's house and the goblin battles could be cut down by half or more and you wouldn't miss ANYTHING.  Well, you might have a 90 minute movie with 90 minutes worth of material, as opposed to a 2-plus hour movie with 90 minutes worth of material.<br /><br />I bought the DVD instead of the Blue Ray because I want it in my library. I'll probably even watch it again with friends over.  But it wasn't worth the extra money to see every wart on the head goblin's belly, if you get my drift.<br /><br />Paul Race - Faith and Fantasy
B003V1WXKU|5.0|I originally read parts of this as a teenager, in Russian translation and it was entertaining, with the stories of opening safes and finding flaws in uranium refinement facilities. Reading the full book, I found more entertaining stories, like about playing drums at Rio carnival. And then I finished the book, and things clicked together into something more important.<br /><br />Feyman has accomplished quite a lot, so what can we learn? Between funny stories, we see that he was gave focused attention to everything he tried, even such things as playing drums or cracking safes or painting. He did not care much about social norms (visiting strip clubs to drink some 7-up), or impressions (calling stupid ideas as such right away), or being organized (nearly sleeping in a pile of fallen leaves once). The last chapter say the most important thing is to be \\"utterly honest\\".<br /><br />By the contrast, social ideal these days appear to be a person who is serious, polite, socially-acceptable and is into \\"getting things done\\" - but does not necessary tries his best to check the important things - much like book reviewers Feyman describes, who gave A rating to a book having nothing but empty pages. And later, such people become just \\"pompous fools\\". We all need to try staying as utterly honest as possible, and making it into key social norm, above all forms of pretense
B007K3JFUQ|4.0|Clever throughout and charming in places, but overly frantic.  Jude Law as a bemused Watson to Robert Downey Jr.'s frantic Holmes continues to provide an effective balance. Stephen Fry as Mycroft and the underrated Kelly Reilly as Mary added a welcome touch.<br /><br />That said, it is NOT as tightly scripted as the original, and the action sequences are more \\"cartooney\\" and frantic.  I WAS glad to see Holmes confront his nemesis, though - that's a welcome change from so many series that never get to that point.<br /><br />If you haven't seen either of these, see the first one first.  For one thing it's a better movie and a better introduction to the core characters.<br /><br />Paul Race - Faith and Fantasy
B00CWY76CC|5.0|Easy, quick, fun. Great for killing time. I find it very relaxing  to play when hubby is playing Xbox.<br />Enjoyable for everyone.
B00BPA6XUK|5.0|Excellent movie and a good soundtrack. If you are not into instrumentals this may not be for you.  seems repetitive at times, but still good music overall.

B004ZMWUCU|3.0|Enjoyed reading the Irish dialect filled with clever sayings.  Humor balanced a sad parallel plot.  Worried it was going to turn into a romance novel.  It didn't.
B005WUHAX8|5.0|I am very accident prone especially with phones. This has been a great case and was easy to install. I haven't water tested it yet because I am terrified but it is very well make and worth the money
B009KS4XRO|4.0|Not on Facebook or not willing to use Facebook friends + spending no real money = slow advances and less prizes and frustration.  Still fun, though.
0321811984|5.0|You probably think your PowerPoints are pretty good. I definitely thought mine were. I knew what bad PowerPoints looked like: Too many words packed onto each slide. Transitions that were too swirly, sparkly, checkerboardy. No consistency in fonts or colors. Mine were nothing like that. So when I first came across Garr Reynolds' book Presentation Zen, my attitude could only be described as smug: I expected it to tell me I was doing everything exactly right, with a few minor tips for improvement. That notion lasted three minutes. After skimming a few pages of the book, I knew my slides were about to change forever.<br /><br />If you work in education, presentation is a daily thing for you. And if you're presenting, you're probably using either PowerPoint or Keynote as a backdrop. You see slideshows in meetings, at professional development workshops, at conferences. They're everywhere, and they're almost all terrible. That's why we all need this book.<br /><br />The mission of Presentation Zen is simple: to rid the world of bad PowerPoint. And \\"bad\\" goes beyond aesthetics. Although you'll definitely be pushed toward cleaner, more sophisticated design, the book's message is bigger: Our presentations - our lessons - are boring. We take material that once stirred us so much we built a career on it, and we reduce it to dry, uninspired text, effectively sucking the soul right out of it. And when we present, we compound the problem: Instead of talking directly to our audience like human beings, we read straight from those soul-sucking slides.<br /><br />As soon as I started reading this book, I seriously couldn't wait to get my hands on my slides. It was like a light switch going off in my brain. And I want that switch to go on in classrooms all over the world.<br /><br />Considering how much time we spend looking at bad PowerPoints, the world would definitely be a better place if more people read this book. Not only will we spend less time fighting sleep in classrooms and conference rooms, but we'll have more of the joy that comes with sharing our passions, the real joy of learning.onference rooms, but we'll have more of the joy that comes with sharing our passions, the real joy of learning.

B005LAIHXQ|5.0|Another Alien experience but with a different twist. Of course the alien grubs are able to overcome the human physical security and jam themselves down the throats of foolish victims. Then there are the Terra forming aliens on a grounded warship who's mission was to destroy earth who thousands of years ago somehow allowed Alien grubs to jam themselves down their throats and kill the crew. Though, after an incredible resurrection, the Caption of the alien crew feels he has to kill all of the humans on his ship and then carry out his ancient mission to destroy Earth even though he should be able to retire after all the thousands of years he has been dormant in cryo-sleep with his back pay and retirement fund probably built up larger than a planets Gross Domestic Product (GDP). But rather than searching out the best retirement options on some alien beach planet and relaxing for the rest of his life he persists on trying to kill &#34;the girl&#34; and gets an Alien tongue jammed down his throat which pretty much finishes him off but &#34;the girl&#34; survives and prevails.
B0002KVULG|3.0|This is my favorite film version of &#34;Dracula,&#34; with a superb performance by Frank Langella. My only quibble is that when it was released to home video, director John Badham tried to make it look like a black-and-white film (which he says he'd wanted to do when he was making the film), and as a result it looks drab. The original theatrical release had very vivid, lush colors; I wish it would be released to home video like that again.
B00000K2UX|5.0|Good music, comfortable active driving and home listening music. All cuts are familiar and at this point in time  - classics.
B007GCY8FS|4.0|Pretty good. Not my favorite. He's getting a bit repetitive, but still a good read. Sometimes he's a bit unbelievable, but will continue to read anything he writes.
B00D7Z4GQY|4.0|This book was engaging and kept me coming back for another page.  The story was interesting and the characters did come together well.  My only complaint was that I felt like I kept waiting for something, kept chasing after something.  Had a little trouble completely settling into the story.
B00DWZHTRW|5.0|Enjoyed watching it. It was nicely edited to keep you guessing til the end. I can see a TV series coming.
B00DWZHTRW|5.0|Let me start out by saying that within the first 2 minutes of this movie, my mind was blown.  In the theater, everyone gasped and clapped along with me.  That's the sign of a great movie.<br /><br />The movie itself is really enjoyable.  It is well-paced and the writing is fantastic.  I enjoyed every exchange between the characters and was on the edge of my seat.  I enjoyed the magic acts as if they were happening in front of me.  The movie's theme appears in both the larger aspects as well as some of the most minute interactions.  I can't say enough about his movie.<br /><br />Rent it if you want, but I would HIGHLY recommend buying this movie and watching it.  Enjoy!
B000002KB8|1.0|Paranoid forever! I wish I could say the same about Black Sabbath's debut. I don't know, but I was far more impressed with the sophomore efforts of Black Sabbath, Led Zeppelin, and Iron Maiden than I was of their debuts. There was something lacking the first time around. Thankfully all three bands kicked ass on Paranoid, Led Zeppelin II, and Killers, which is my favorite CD released in the 80s. Up the Irons.
B00DR0PDNE|5.0|Love using this little guy, sending Google Play music, Youtube and Google Play TV/Movies to my TV is extremely easy. This is exactly what I was looking for to complement my Roku, since I cant connect to Google's products for the most part.
0307950689|1.0|Sorry, Dan, I didn't like this. It was okay but that bitch Inoue ruined it for me. I can't imagine our heroic Robert Langdon calling that midget bore 'ma'am'. I used to think that Deception Point was your least impressive work until this one came along. Thankfully you redeemed yourself with Inferno, and that where that bitch Inoue is burning now.

B0050DIWFC|4.0|Listened for Bookclub (Audible/DFWTea)<br />Defending Jacob by William Landay<br />Overall Rating: 4.25<br />Story Rating: 4.50<br />Character Rating: 4.00<br /><br />Audio Rating: 4.00 (Not part of the overall rating)<br /><br />First Thought When Finished: I DID NOT SEE THAT COMING AT ALL! Sure I saw part of it but holy whiplash at the end.<br /><br />Speed Date Review<br /><br />First Date: I admit at first I wasn't pulled into this story. It took awhile to grab me. The pacing was a little slow but then BAM!<br /><br />Second Date: I was almost sure I knew who had committed the crime but I wasn't sure how it was going to play out. There was a few times that I questioned my thoughts on who did it. I love when thrillers do that to me!<br /><br />Third Date: I was right about who did it but wow did not see the end coming at all. I mean there was a twist and there was a TWIST! It was fantastically chilling. I seriously had to listen to it twice just so that I could make sure I heard it right! I did and WOW!<br /><br />Audio Date:<br /><br />  Narrated by Grover Gardner /Running Time 12 hrs and 25 mins<br /><br />Grover Gardner was a really great choice for this audiobook. He had just enough gruff in his voice to pull off the tone and I think it enhanced the story. His pacing was great and his female voices weren't to bad. Overall, I am glad I chose to listen to this one on audio!<br /><br />Relationship Status: We had a great run! I will be checking out William Landay in the future.

B000068QKT|5.0|A favorite film. Whimsical, funny, beautiful. I gifted a friend with this dvd and she also loves it. Just may have to order one for myself!
B00AZMFJYA|2.0|How a viewer responds to this film depends entirely on what one is hoping to get out of it. That may be the case with every film and thus a statement of the obvious, but I think that it is especially true with regard to this one. If one is just looking for an exciting, briskly-paced film with plenty of action, an attractive cast and some great visuals, then Star Trek Into Darkness will deliver. It is certainly not guilty of being boring, as some previous ST films have been.<br /><br />On the other hand, if one is looking for a well-written screenplay or a new-ground-breaking story, those things are not to be found here. I will grant that this film attempts to deal with some current issues such as terrorism and militarism, but it does not develop those themes nearly as well as it could have it if was not so busy shamelessly, clumsily recycling elements from Stark Trek II: The Wrath of Khan. Now, I certainly enjoy seeing familiar faces show up again and graceful nods to the past. But there is a big difference between that done well, and the way that it is done in this film. This smacks of laziness,unoriginality and really just a profound lack of either comprehension and/or care for what Star Trek is really about, i.e. exploring new territory and addressing issues with eloquence. What a frustratingly wasted opportunity, considering the fresh reboot that this franchise has potentially been given.<br /><br />Specifically, the use of Benedict Cumberbatch's character is in my personal view an unforgivable sin. He is a very fine actor and if the screenplay would only continue on the path that it starts out on with regard to the character in the early parts of the film, things could be great. But for some reason, the writers/director/producers felt compelled to be clever or something and twist the character in an entirely arbitrary, disrespectful and ultimately ineffective way. I do not like to be very negative, but in this case, it simply cannot go unnoted.<br /><br />On the brighter (okay, darker) flip side, there is one scene in which this film really breaks through into the realm of truly, insanely good:<br />SPOILER**************<br />*********************<br />*********************<br />When Khan kills Admiral Marcus on the dark bridge of the warship, as Kirk watches stunned and Carol screams like she's in a slasher film, for a brief moment STID lives up to its name and gives us something truly crazy and new. It's violent, but it's sharply composed and purely effective. A film full of that sort of vivid content would have impressed me.<br />*********************<br />END SPOILER**********<br /><br />To wrap up, Star Trek Into Darkness is fine as a casual, do-not-think-about-it too much \\"spaceships and lasers\\" action film. But it is not a good Star Trek film. Worth watching at least once, if only to form an objective personal opinion? Sure. But I am sincerely hoping for something much better the next time around. Star Trek deserves better.<br /><br />Note: The basic DVD-only version of this film does not include any special features to speak of. That is unfortunate for those of us who have not yet switched to Blu-Rays, but to be expected I suppose.
B00004Y262|5.0|I had the album Play years ago and lost it along the way. SO glad I happened upon this version as there are even more amazing songs.
034580404X|5.0|Get this for the wife, barnes and knobles has it for 50 so u save 20 here. Besides it keeps her from nagging since her attention will be on the book. It also gets her in the mood alot so be ready
B004LWZWGK|5.0|Chris Nolan nails us again with his wonderfully informed look at the Gotham Crusader!  There is a lot here and all of it works.
B005V2EVBQ|5.0|This is a great product for the price. You can't go wrong with this. It seems to hold up well. I have it about 2 weeks. So far so good. As stated its also easy to care for. So if you need a case for your kindle fire. This is the one you want.
B004EF65QA|5.0|I own this movie on dvd and I love it.  However, when I tried to watch it on your sight, there were problems with it.  Some of the movie had technical difficulties, and did not come through.  If I had not watched it about a few years ago on my dvd, I would not have known that some of the really good scenes were cut off.  The only reason that I watched it here was because I saw it on your list of movie unlimited streaming, and thought that I would save myself the trouble of getting up to change the disc.  It is a beautiful story line and easy to follow.  Please take a look at your movie copy and see if there is anything you can do to fix the problem with it.  It mostly comes at the end of the episodes.
B001AQO3QA|4.0|This package is worth it for the first 2 movies. A suspense film and a one of the greatest action movies.
B00B2JSRAS|4.0|There is nothing I disliked about this book , if more people could read this book and in fact apply it to their lives who knows how many lives will be changed and opportunities seized. I have started by practicing the principles taught in this book and endeavour to live by them....in fact my very first experiment was with my job . I always work contracts and when they were about to end I used to go into a panic....this time I just relaxed and thanked the universe for my next contract which arrived on time...try it!!!!
0451197879|5.0|Road work is not a horror book like most Steven King books are. It is about a man who is being forced to move because a highway is going through where his longtime residence is. His workplace is also being forced out of business. He ends up divorced, jobless and decides to get even!
B00DXP7L88|1.0|The last episode was so disappointing, almost felt like it deserved another season to really sum things up in whole. the ending should have went like this, dexter and Deborah get caught somehow for involvement in laguertas death, and everyone finds out who dexter is and all he's done, even framing dobts the \\"bay harbor butcher\\", they get found out after debs already shot and brain dead in the hospital, dexters on the run and during the commotion for the storm in the hospital dexter sneaks to get deb and take her off life support and takes her out on the boat to dump her in the ocean because he cant let her live like that, just as in earlier seasons he killed that one lady/friend that worked with him, with the key lime pie she wanted. dexter kisses deb on the lips while holding her right before dumping her over the boat into the water, maybe almost finally realizing he may had felt some feelings for her after all, since they explored deb being in love with dexter and didn't really go anywhere with it. deb sinks into the water, everyone knows who dexter really is and what he has done being the bay harbor butcher and such, he cant go join Hannah and Harrison in Argentina because he realizes from deb dying that he needs to protect them from himself because everyone he loved has died, so he drives into the storm to die but survives and instead of him being some lumber jack looking person at the end they should of shown him in another country not Argentina in a kill room with someone and he says something like he may not be able to protect the ones he loves/loved but at least he can keep the monsters at bay. the he stabs them and looks up smiling at the camera, then black screen and the end. and maybe something to suggest he finally feels feelings, except the ones he feels in the end are the ones the people he loved felt, like deb he feels her pain, I mean they left so much, unfinished, and made a lot they explored in the past 3 seasons look irrelevant also. it was sloppy to say the best, I love dexter but the last episode wrapping everything up was poorly written. I wish it could have been different.to say the best, I love dexter but the last episode wrapping everything up was poorly written. I wish it could have been different.
B005ZOBNOI|5.0|I've heard a lot of talk about this book lately, and decided to read it. So glad I did! Recommend this book to everyone!
B0064X7FVE|1.0|The old version was great. It was a wonderful way to check the weather before getting dressed in the morning. The latest version takes so long to load; if it loads at all; that I would be late to work if I checked it. It has all these obnoxious ads on it and it is difficult to navigate quickly to the info I need. It is faster to just go online and check the weather. What a worthless app!
B00CLZ4B4I|2.0|I expected more from this movie.Not having read the book, I did not know the true story line.weak acting and just a big letdown
B00EMJD6TC|5.0|I read the reviews on this before I purchased it and had prepared myself not to expect too much. I've made the mistake of having great expectations based on reviews (ie: Paranormal Activity).<br /><br />I was actually pleasantly surprised! This film was action packed from beginning to end. Brad Pitt gave a wonderful performance. The zombies were unlike any I've seen to date. They were super fast and STRONG!!! There were so many of them!!! This movie had me on the edge of my seat. Not a lot of gore, none really, but very effective. It's not really needed. It reminded me of The Others. Nothing graphic, but very, very effective. I highly recommend this zombie flick !
B008469DGY|5.0|Very fun! If you like golfing games this one is pretty fun, not so realistic because you have a lot of control over where the ball goes but a lot of fun! Overall very nice app with nice pretty scenes for a while you're golfing!
1400052181|5.0|Great read! I was lucky to have this book required for one of my classes this semester and would recommend it to anyone looking for an incredible story!

B00CDV6WDS|3.0|I have several mahjong games.. This one I bought so could use it on my cell phone.. Its not the best.. It has a lot of games that I've had to start over more then once.. Its way to hard for what I wanted... I like to be able to solve these without to much trouble. This one is just to tough for my liking.... So if you like a Big challenge then this is the game for you.. I'll pass... Would recommend this but only to a few people..
B00CKKDZ2S|1.0|It's a sad little app --- using the lure of angels to then connect you onto any number of junkie websites that try to sell  you a bunch on junk.  You think you're picking an angel card that will give you any inspirational message but then you hit in the face with awful advertising instead.  Whoever came up with this app is EVIL.
B006GWO5NE|3.0|I got this as I had had to send back one kindle fire with charging issues... This was what was recommend  to solve my problem.. This is nice but I was told I would get instructions on how to use it when it came.. NOT... Would be nice to know just how long to charge with this!!! Not to mention what happens if you leave it plugged in for extended time... NOT any instructions on ANYTHING in regard to this charger... About all I can say is it works an it doesn't take a long time to charge. I just don't know exactly how long... So I'm afraid to go off an leave it plugged in fro any length of time. I plug it in an check on it about every hour or so as I don't want to ruin my Kindle!!! So not at all happy with this at all.... That's why I'm not giving this much of a rating... NEXT time SEND instruction on how this works.....
B00BQ1DBUS|3.0|Rod Stewart looking back. Bought this for the wife she loves rod Stewart. You can certainly hear alot of it trying to reach back in to is old sound. To be truthful there's about 3 maybe 4 songs that are really good, but the rest are forgettable. It feels like the Record company asked for and album so he just threw one together. shame really
B009AY04A8|5.0|Simple to use... Not to hard.  I like to be able to find things but make it so simple as to be childish. This is just about my speed.. You have to look for items but for the most part they can be found without a lot of trouble... Not like a few of these I've played that you have to get  hints all the time to find half the items.... Even the mini games are easy but not simple. A lot of the games I've played the mini games are a bad joke. Impossible to solve.  Over all its nice Easy paced game. Dialog can be a long but it is a story an you can skip it when ever you want to.. Nice touch I think.. This would be a nice one to start with for anyone interested in this kind of game.. I would recommend this one!!!!
B0069G5Z9K|5.0|My grandson asked me to download this game for him.  As it turns out, I love playing the game as well!  It's fast paced and lots of fun.

B0028MBKVG|5.0|&#34;This book changed my life&#34; ....I heard that time and time again.  This book, really did, change my life.  It just changes how you think of the whole running industry, it inspires you to eat differently, run differently, think differently.  You'll realize how much of a conspiracy Nike is... And will be in full support of wearing Vibram Five Fingers... Yes, those &#34;weird&#34; toe shoes.  It is a great story about a wonderful running tribe.  Read this book!
0307951154|5.0|Kept you reading to the very end.  Not as graphic as previous Leopard, will buy his next one. He is a winner.
B003B02O3C|5.0|It was a great read. Opened my eyes into the world of lawyers and what not, and did a great job showing the corruption of big business. I'd highly recommend this book to anyone.

B00CL68QVQ|2.0|Jennifer Lawrence should have gotten an Oscar for &#34;Winter's Bone&#34;, not a movie that feels bland and lifeless like &#34;Silver Lining's Playbook&#34;. There really is no story here, and what little there is could only be made entertaining by the great actors in this movie. Thumbs down.
B00EY8BRGU|3.0|Not a waste of time and quite entertaining. This isn't the best movie of all time but good none the less.
B00D7Z4GQY|5.0|Read this for a book club. Not something I would normally read but enjoyed it very much.  I would recommend.
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|Amazingly addictive, it's free and its better than games you can get for five dollars, point is, this thing rocks.
B009NH6AOQ|5.0|Really enjoy the series and hated that the third season was over so quickly (it seemed).  I cannot wait until the next season is available to purchase.

B00A8ECU24|4.0|as a brony, I love this game its cute and it has technicolor ponies, as a gamer, I do like the Sims/Empire Earth-Esque builder (I've played the original Empire Earth its about like that, Minus the wars and epic battles) it is very addicting, and a good way to pass the time. what I don't like is the fact that the ingame currancy 'Bits' while easy to collect in time, the Ponies and buildings to buy them with are mind bogglingly expensive. and gems are a hassle to get as well. now I do understand that this is a game where, while the game itself is free, some of the content requires you to spend real money. there Are ways around this however. for instance if you leave the game alone for a while and let the stores stockpile your 'Bits' it will build up in time. as well you can build more stores that while cost more money to build make up more then enough back when at full production.<br /><br />I hope Hasbro Liscense the series to a new PC or Console game for the MLP series. and hopefully a good game. and this game IS good. and fun. but the pay real money for content thing is a fly in Celestia's Cake for me. (that and I'm a stingy pony myself lol)<br /><br />But I do recommend this game.
B007ZGO7EM|5.0|Perfect!!!  Just what I need for quick computations.  Easy to use.  Easy to read keys are nice &amp; big.  Don't change a thing!!
B007J4T2G8|5.0|Very easy read and you instantly ache for Anastasia, a character that hits home with the feeling vs of any woman.
B005544TRQ|4.0|I love this show. What a great concept. I really enjoy the banter between the characters, so sharp and witty.  This one keeps my attention, not always an easy feat.<br />Thanks Amazon Prime!
B00C061I3K|5.0|This album is phenomenal. It open my mind to types of music I never really thought to listen to. I really like daft punk to begin with but this album is a treat. My most favored track is probably instant crush, but I love the whole album!
B0059XTV4Y|5.0|It is great, and Madonna has proven her talent as a director. Congratulations!<br />I expect more and more people can watch the movie and see what I saw.
B000AGTPUU|5.0|This is a must see....<br />The technology behind this is outstanding<br />this will become a yearly must watch movie at Christmas
B0083ZRAJS|3.0|great book everyone should read, so different from the movie, such imagination.  Did you know Dorthy didn't really wear ruby slippers - surprised me too
B000VMFDW2|5.0|This book should be required reading for anyone under the age of thirty.  We can't be allowed to forget the hell in which some of our fellow citizens suffered and died for their generation, for future generations, and their country.  Even though I thought I knew much about the history of WWII, I really had no conception of the terror and misery of front line Marines and Soldiers in the Pacific until I read this book.
B004DLPXAO|5.0|Now I can read all the books I have on my kindle.  my kindle and phone even sink - so great
0545586178|5.0|This was probably my favorite in the series, and I highly recommend this book and the whole series to anyone.  It says a lot about some of the themes currently running through our culture.

0316066524|1.0|Insurmountable Crap<br /><br />What was Wallace thinking?  Are publishers sooo desperate to find something \\"new\\" that they would go to such lengths to waste so much ink and chop down all the trees to produce this rancid tomb (Yes, I meant to write tomb!)?  He didn't really get a MacArthur Fellowship for this book, let's make that very clear.  Where did Wallace expect to end up with this extremely bulky doorstop?  It is troubling that suicide is mentioned so many times in the book.  Couldn't someone see that as a forewarning?<br /><br />It's not like it is totally incomprehensible or incoherent, BUT it is very nearly close to zero in both of those categories.  It is insipid and very, very inchoate.  If you're looking for some sort of delicious literary meal, you ain't gonna find it in Wallace's book(s).  Don't buy it nor the hype of the 4-5 star reviews and/or blurbmeisters---->\\" A work of genius...\\"; \\"Mind-altering comedy...\\"; \\"...authentic passion on every page.\\"; \\"Uproarious...\\";  \\"darkly witty...\\".  Ha!  Who actually enjoyed this thing all the way through?--->\\"surprisingly readable\\".  Good luck...  Thankfully, I'd just borrowed Wallace's effort from our local library.<br /><br />Does the senses galvanized along the banks of the Euphrates translate into 16th notes if Mondays are irrevocably linked to the women of Oman in the seventh month following the rehabilitation of the hair once associated with Tyler's dog?  If the previous sentence makes any sort of sense to you, Wallace's book may be right up your alley.  But that \\"author\\" obviously didn't follow Elmore Leonard's last tenet of his \\"10 Rules for Writing\\" which states, \\"Try to leave out the part that readers tend to skip.\\"  Wallace's hoax may have only been 25 pages long, if that.  Star worthiness?  I'll give it a .000003%<br /><br />Seriously, Jf
B003XF1XOQ|3.0|I thought that it was a little depressing.  Ofcourse, it had to end something like it did.  I liked it fairly well but not as much as I liked the first two.
B009RX85N0|5.0|Each episode is interesting and action packed. Love the characters! Really like the concept of the series based around fictional characters from classic stories such as Snow White, Cinderella, etc.. Once upon a time is a great and very catchy title! Can't wait for season three!
B004J4WLB4|4.0|I really liked this book. Victoria has struggled in the foster care system. She didn't feel loved so when her current situation would be going really well she would do something to screw it up and be thrown back into the system. When she is 10, she is placed with Elizabeth who loves her, starts to crack Victoria's shell and teaches her the language of flowers. Victoria takes to it like a fish to water. Working with flowers is second nature for her. She gathers clients who think she is a wizard. As you learn about Victoria, your heart goes out to her as she struggles to find her way. She doesn't like to be touched, doesn't know what love feels like and just doesn't know how to be a part of society. She just tries to survive. The book switches between current life and snippets of her life with Elizabeth with a final conclusion at the end of the two stories coming together. This was beautifully written. I know most foster care stories in the news are horror stories. You don't read stories very often of the ones who try hard for the kids. We have friends who have been foster parents of special needs kids and they adopted four of the kids. It's foster parents like them who make up for all the ones who are just in it for the extra money. I recommend this book. It's a beautiful story and characters you will fall in love with.
B00EL8JCGU|1.0|This film,  \\"World War Z\\"  Could also be titled....  \\"The best thing that ever happened to Earth\\"  and there was no \\"war\\" involved.

You could use ANY sample or drop of blood.  And how will a vaccine help?  The virus converts ALL your cells in 12 seconds!  That's billions of cells in 12 seconds?  That would be like emptying all the oceans with a teaspoon in 12 seconds.... anyways.....  And why did Brad even have a family?  They served no purpose in the story.  And....  Oh.... forget it.  I give up.
B0071XO8RA|5.0|HOWEY's characters in this story jump to life.  The strong, brave an  resilient Juliette is a heroin to be loved and admired. I am excited to continue the journey with this series!  Thank you!
B000TFINY6|4.0|This is a great series and season. I don't see that most people had this problem but my disk five which should include the finale is actually disk one. Cross your fingers if you buy bluray. Otherwise you may want to go digital for this season.
B00821OX98|5.0|This series has just enough action to satisfy and leaves a little bit of unknowns to keep you guessing. There are some surprises as well. It's better than a similar I have seen. I would recommend it.
159562015X|5.0|I used this book for a staff in-service session to help each staff person understand their individual strengths and I also asked them to rate their co-workers.  I took the ratings that each person did for their co-workers and complied them for each staff person so that they could see how their co-workers viewed them and their strengths.  We were all surprised at the results.  We discussed the findings and applied them to our individual jobs to help us all improve in areas that we were not considered strong and to utilize the strengths that we have to work better as a team.  I would recommend this book to any group to use as a tool to help their staff as well as themselves recognize and recall talents that we may have overlooked or forgotten due to job changes or lack of opportunity to use those gifts. The staff loved the book and thanked me for giving it to them.<br /><br />Linda
B0048KXRR6|5.0|I was happily surprised by the fresh new story...not a remake of the first...rather a creative look at an common theme
B005LAIGW8|5.0|this movie was badass it was awesome as hell. i hope theres going to to be a 3 rd obe which the way it ended there will be
B008TRUDAS|5.0|Loved the words, the rhythms and the way the emotions were brought to life so that you remembered being a teenager, and then thrust too fast into adulthood.  Everyone has a story, but not everyone is resilient.  Read this book for strength you have inside you.  Highly recommended.
B009YP9L7U|4.0|This book was nothing more than an enjoyable way to pass a Sunday afternoon while the hubs watched football. I enjoyed the plot and the story. Is it one of those stories that I'll remember in a month, six months or a year? No, not at all...but for a free book it didn't disappoint and I'm happy to have read it. The plot never got too detailed, the story never FULLY developed, but I can live with it.
B0040HO01Y|5.0|Lark Rise to Candleford has excellent characterization and gentle rivalry between two late 19th century English communities. Heartwarming examples of integrity, loyalty and kindness.
B0071XO8RA|1.0|I made it through the first section of WOOL and the first few pages of the second section.  I stopped when I realized I really didn't care about the newly introduced main characters, and I could see well enough what was happening:  the book was going to string us along for hundreds of pages with the promise to reveal a \\"big secret\\" that, in the end, simply wouldn't justify the pain of getting there.<br /><br />The prose was emotionally overwrought, resulting in a plodding, slow pace.<br /><br />The premise (people living in a contained environment, not entirely sure where they are or why) was overly familiar.<br /><br />The character motivations were a joke.  The POV character and his wife are trying to have a baby.  They aren't succeeding, but at some point in \\"trying,\\" the wife discovers the reason for why they are locked in the silo.  Guess what:  it appears to be some type of big conspiracy!  Wow.  So what does she do?  She says she wants to leave, and they let her leave.  They cycle her out the airlock with a rag, and ask her to please clean the lens of the camera that looks at the outside world.  Does she tell her husband the big secret?  No.  Why not?  Well, that would spoil the next 500 pages of the book, for one thing.  Otherwise, I can't imagine why a person would behave this way.  Honest.  \\"Sorry, honey, but I have to leave because it's all a big conspiracy, but ... I'm not going to tell you why I think that.\\"  If she's schizophrenic, yes.  Otherwise, no.<br /><br />Three years after his beloved wife walks out of his life and out of the silo, the husband finally decides he can't go on without her, and he requests to be let out of the silo.  So they let him out.  They cycle him out the airlock with a rag, asking him to clean the lens of the camera.  Part 1 ends with him (apparently, allegedly) dying from whatever is out there.<br /><br />Part 2 begins (wait for it):  right back where Part 1 started.  Here we are, back in the silo, and we have a character who is determined to find out what the big mystery is.  She could have saved herself (and the rest of us) a lot of time by asking the previous woman what it was she found, but no, she has to do the research for herself.  Don't expect the answers to show up any time soon.<br /><br />Sorry, but the obviously bogus 5-star reviews make it impossible for me to give this thing the 2 stars it might otherwise deserve.
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|I love this game! I have not had any problems with it and play it all the time! It's fun and challenging!
B00633W614|5.0|Although some of his plots are very similar to his previous novels, Archer is a fabulous story teller and his books are very hard to put down. This series is no exception. What an imagination he has!
B005OCFHHK|3.0|Received the discs via USPS within 4 days. The packaging is decent and cannot complain. However the blu ray video quality leaves a lot to be desired. The quality although better than regular DVD's are definitely not blu ray quality as I expected. I dont experience the good quality that has come to be expected of blu ray discs. Other than that there is nothing else to say. The movie as everyone knows is fantastic so no complaints there.
B006M4F67A|5.0|Like the layouts and color schemes. Easy to identify 3D images. One of my favorite Mahjong games.<br />Looking forward to many fun games of Mahjong on Kindle Fire.

B00D7Z4GQY|5.0|I got this book on audio to listen to during an 8 hour trip. I was so entertained by the story and found myself looking forward to the drive home just to finish it! I really enjoyed how well she described the characters, and love how the book ended. Great read, and great author!
B00D7Z4GQY|3.0|Didn't really hold my interest. I kept reading it, hoping it would get better.  It finally came all together at the end, but not worth the wait.

B007GCY8FS|3.0|I am a HUGE Reacher fan but this book seems like Jack has run out of adventure. It was the slowest adventure ever. Poor misunderstood Jack is still poorly misunderstood. Took too long for many details to come together, one of which (he could have been a father) was blown over and dropped like a lead balloon. Disjointed and pedantically plotted. Sorry Jack. Time to stop hitch-hiking and get a life.
B00DNUSFWE|5.0|This Blu-ray release of 1931 version of FRANKENSTEIN is incredible<br />i already have the 75th Anniversary edition from 2006<br />which the film is only Digitally remastered which sounds and looks really Good anyway.<br />I Grew up watching this film when it used to be broadcasted on Late night TV<br />so i Definitely have alot of respect for this film and being in black & white makes the film special<br />and very well actored by Boris Karloff and Colin clive<br /><br />So when i found that Universal were giving this old film a blu-ray release<br />i knew i had to buy it just to watch the blu-ray quality,<br />to see for myself if the picture has been Digital restored in HD<br /><br />and i was absolutely amazed when i watched the whole film<br />the picture and audio quality looks and sounds fantastic, better than the 75th Anniversary edition<br />mainly cause the film has been restored in High Definition blu-ray quality, that's why.<br />the Audio is obviously Mono sound but the quality of the Audio has definitely been enhanced<br />to sound close to stereo<br />so the audio quality is the best it's ever going to get for a very old film<br />so i am shocked and surprised on how Good the picture and Audio quality is for this blu-ray release<br />the film is in Fullscreen format of course<br />Universal HD Dptmnt really did make an effort for this classic.<br /><br />About the special features/extras, there is nothing new with the extras<br />the special features are exactly the same as on the 75th Anniversary edition DVD<br />The Frankenstein files Documentary, Karloff the Gentle monster Documentary<br />Universal Horror Documentary, Trailer Gallery and 2 Audio commentaries recorded back in 2005<br />for the Anniversary edition.<br />the Only brand new featurette is 100 years of Universal-restoring the classics<br />a 10min featurette about Universal staff members restoring some old classic films in HD for blu-ray release<br /><br />so the only reason to get thisblu-ray of FRANKENSTEIN is that the film has been<br />Digitally restored in High Definition, well as close enough to HD as you going to get<br />as the film is very very old<br />so Universal did the best Job they possibly could do to give this film HD quality<br />A 5 star rating No Doubt about it.<br />plus you get all the Documentaries and featurettes from the previous DVD release anyway.<br />Definitely worth the money.
B004VMUS9G|5.0|The design overallbis very well done ans it actually works and doesn't screw you over like others did. I like how it works on my Kindle fire 1st gen and my Droid x. I would really reccomend it to a friend. Best part: Its free!
B00EY8BRGU|5.0|I was pleasantly entertained by this film. It is unbelievable in many ways, but still fun to enter that world. The actors are excellent.
B001NLL93W|5.0|Couldn't wait to start reading and continue this wonderful adventure with these characters. Will be looking forward to the following books of this series.
B00ESY7QXI|4.0|As a huge fan of this book, I can say that this movie does not disappoint. It is entertaining and offers a new perspective on this beloved tale of decadence and woe.
B008P1EWIM|5.0|I use this every day.  Our local weather isn't all that great.  We live in a small town, so it isn't always on the tv when I need to know.
0143034901|5.0|Hard to believe a translation could read so scrumptiously.  I am savoring every word.  Ordered it before a trip to Barcelona and now am reliving the streets and squares when I see names I recognize.  But all that fun pales next to the amazing story-telling and beautiful use of words Zafon has created in this book-within-a-book magical tale.  I don't want it to ever end.  A timeless classic, beautifully written and translated.
B005Q1W10A|5.0|I love all of the characters - they really touch your heart and the story-line keeps you excited about what's coming next.<br />Can't wait for the 4th season to air on PBS this coming January!!  I love the show - it's the best!!
B005ELQVGW|5.0|I had thought that my hypothetical desert-island list of 10 albums would be entirely filled by David Bowie. Two minutes into listening to Moon for the first time, I knew Biophilia would be on that list.<br /><br />An amazing artistic achievement on its own, but the videos are also wonderful (which we can expect from Bj&ouml;rk always (well, maybe not Hidden Place)), and many of the remixes are great additions to the work.<br /><br />I don't think a day has gone by without listening to something from Biophilia since I got it.
B00CF34B2I|4.0|I am an avid MTG player and this app is a lot of fun for when you have that itch to play on the go or don't have your cards.  However both myself and my boyfriend who purchased this on his kindle are having the same problems with the multiplayer function, it's disappointing because it's the only reason we even bought the full app.
B0099Y2MYK|5.0|Like the first two seasons, this was great.  Shirley Maclaine's appearance added a humorous touch to this.  The last episode seemed a bit contrived, however.
B00915G6MG|5.0|NCIS - my favorite TV series - has everything a good show should have - show plot and personal character situations.
B000AJIF4E|5.0|I am thoroughly satisfied.  These are comfortable, and appear to be durable, as well.  The sound quality is better than I expected for the price.
B008NAFU9A|5.0|Well, now that I'm a fan (I just recently purchased [[ASIN:B00729GQ0A THE FOREVER GIRL]] and am already more than halfway through), I just had to search and see what else the author, Rebecca Hamilton, has written for us. I found this novella immediately (as well as Rebecca's book for kids [[[ASIN:1938750705 Good Morning, Sun]]], which I also enjoyed).<br /><br />This novella (it's less than half the length of The Forever Girl) was just what I was hoping to find! It's not a prequel or a sequel, in the true sense of the word (Ms. Hamilton calls it a \\"prelude\\"), but a short novel telling the story of Ophelia. It's a separate story but is connected in subtle ways to her first novel.<br /><br />I recommend that you get \\"Her Sweetest Downfall\\" along with your purchase of The Forever Girl. It's a no-brainer, as they say. In fact, I suggest you read this one FIRST because it lays the groundwork and introduces the background and world that you will find in The Forever Girl.<br /><br />Looking forward to more from this wonderful author!
B009LDCXNY|5.0|We bought this for our son who is a fan of the tv series.  He loves this series and has watched all the shows.
B00729GQ0A|5.0|The thing about this story from Rebecca Hamilton is the writing. You are drawn in so FAST. I only read the first page to see if I'd like it, skimming really, and in an instant I was IN! Ms. Hamilton is a very accomplished writer.<br /><br />I'm a fan of True Blood (not the show, well, at least not since the second season), and LOVE Sookie Stackhouse. At first Sophia Parsons (she's a wiccan) reminded me a bit of Sookie. But after just a few pages, I could see Sophia had much more depth as a character and I really felt for her and her situation. The love affair is perfect, and the action and details Rebecca Hamilton provides are, at times, breathtaking. I want the movie version NOW!!! Rebecca, please let us all know when your book's been optioned so we can start looking forward to the movie.<br /><br />Fans of Celia Rees, Elizabeth George Speare, Anne Rice --- and even J.K. Rowling! --- will enjoy this read. It's a wiccan story for everyone!
B00BLF9FOK|5.0|This movie was fun to watch.  It was a good action flick for Arnold lovers.  We enjoyed watching this film.
B00ET47USI|5.0|Awesome animation. I really enjoy the game after hours of playing it I have not gotten tired of playing it yet.
B003Q6D2B4|4.0|Great movie, although I would not have very young children view it. Bruce Willis;<br />Morgan Freeman and Helen Mirran were wonderful. Although much violence it was still a<br />fun movie. Have watched it several times and will watch it again.
B004SVM7BW|5.0|if you receive pdf attachments to your emails via your cell phone, this android app is a necessity. simple to use and effective.
B000001ELR|5.0|Start off by saying I am not in the KISS army, not a die hard and no allegiances to Peter Criss or Ace, been to several concerts and a huge fan of great hard rock music...and this fits the bill. I love KISS and Love Gun and Destroyer are favorites.  Creatures of THe Night rocks and IMO this is the album they should have put out after Love Gun.  Creatures has it all.  Sing along anthems like I Love It Loud, air guitar classics like Killer, and War Machine is a dead ringer for God Of Thunder part II.  Oh yeah, one complaint...it's too short, only nine songs.  It Keeps Me Coming!
0679411585|5.0|The story telling is second to none.  Joe Galloway's ability to write is beautiful.  Col. Moore is an inspiration and a man that is truly an American Hero.  I am not sure how many tears ran down my cheeks while reading of the heroism of Moore's men, but their families should all be proud.
B00E3VTR1K|5.0|A collection of short stories masterfully engineered by Luca Rossi and translated into English by Andrea Pakieser.  These shorts range from technological intrigue involving the internet and a persons essence shaping the world in their favor like a deity, interstellar occupation by the human race but also shared with vampires, to an action packed techno spy thriller where artificial intelligences control everyone through their smart-phones reminiscent of William Gibson.<br /><br />Though these are all great works and would merit stand alone attention, one of the works that jumped out at me the most involved a woman tired of her failed hetero-relationships who takes on a robotic partner.  Evolving in the relationship leads to her partner getting upgrades to graduate from male plaything to parental role model and best friend not unlike Robin Williams role in Bicentennial Man.<br /><br />There are several other stories I have not mentioned in this review but they are well worth reading.  I recommend this work and look forward to this authors future ventures in the writing world.
B0001L3LUE|5.0|The reality of good versus evil (or how those in authority would like us to view life) is put aside.  Being able to see how war not only affects the casualties, but those that fight is refreshing.  The discussion of both sides is monumental as they take us on a journey to discover the &#34;why&#34;.<br />Well done documentary.  I loved the book, and purchased this to show to others.
B004SJ3AXI|4.0|Another fun format calling for your kids (or you) to figure out angles, tension,structural characteristics. All this and much more.
B00BOLE7X0|3.0|If you are looking for something action packed...keep looking.  The story line was very good, and the acting was well done.  There were times where the story did seem to drag.  Glad that we purchased and viewed this, but I would only recommend if you enjoy history, and varying views of it.
B003VANOFY|4.0|love the surround, but my wife's bose earbuds have more bass. but considering they were 30 bucks more than this headset, i still feel like these are a good value. sound is crystal clear, functions as described, and really comfortable. 4 stars!
B000BBOV8U|5.0|From the 80's to movie themes this Anthology Album has it covered.  The recordings are excellent, as well as the selection.  I am sure that someone's favorite song was left out, but that is the case with most greatest hits albums.
B005H9B2CE|3.0|Thor is an interesting movie in many ways, but it is not a serious movie in any way.  The acting is adequate but not Academy Award level; the special effects are acceptable but not outstanding.  The fight scenes keep your interest but are not that clever or well done.  Still, the movie does have a nice flavor and I kind of enjoyed it.
B00EXVZW6E|5.0|Really like this game. I have another by the same company and they both have so many levels of play. I'm always delighted when another window opens after hitting a certain level.
B009WUAK2M|3.0|As an action movie, this one does fine.  As a movie that has even a tiny bit of realism, it fails horribly.  That said, it is entertaining, and it keeps your interest (even though the plot is kind of thin).  It's the typical lets see how many bad guys we can kill in an hour and a half.  I actually enjoyed the first part of the movie more than the second (first 15 minutes they have a successful attack on initial objective).  It is kind of funny that you have so many &#34;big&#34; names that have such minor parts (as Arnold and Bruce who are only token players).  Anyway, it you like mindless entertainment, go for it.
B0058SNI5S|1.0|They were Very uncomfortable. I am Returing them asap.I have sensitive feet and these shoes hurt.thank you for asking me.
B00B7Y0206|5.0|I would DOWNLOAD IT it's great I couldn't use youtube so I had to use this IT saved my life
B00CWY76CC|5.0|I love these kind of challenges, this one is not too hard . No intrusive ads either. A great way to relax.
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|Who would not love a minion and to race around different places.  The challenges are fun and make giggle. Full of fun
0425263924|3.0|I have to admit, I hesitated before buying this book because it had gotten so many awful reviews.<br />Since I read the first two, I decided why not? It wasn't that bad.  I do understand everyone being upset that the author left a lot of details untied.<br />There's a lot of sex. Plenty of it. But I would've loved to see more of Cary in this one. I thought he was a blast in the first edition, he kind of got lost in the 2nd edition and in this edition, you don't really get much of him until probably towards the ending.<br />But it's pretty much the same story line as the last two editions with Gideon and Eva.<br />I'll probably read the fourth edition when it comes out.
0316044938|4.0|Others have described this book as being a little humorous.  I didn't get that at all from this book.  I cried, like real tears falling on pages, several times.  I hated it.  I loved it.  It was a GREAT book.  There were a few things that happened I found completely unbelievable - and I am not talking about afterlife stuff.  I'm referring to a parent asking a child to put herself into a dangerous situation to find clues, a child being left in the care of a mall \\"daycare.\\"  I am purposely being kind of vague so I don't spoil anything.  I just found myself saying NO WAY - after what these parents have been through - NO WAY would they allow certain things to happen.  Anyway, really, really great book.  Highly recommended!!!
B00D6BQG1W|4.0|We enjoyed this movie...a love story not a scary movie. Easy entertainment....only used the 'F' word once, which is rare these days.
B004GJYROG|5.0|Great movie bring back great childhood memories:) can in less than a week. Works great, and is a good movie
B007FH0ALK|5.0|Another Amazon shopper recommended this instead of the Anniversary edition.<br />I love this album. I own The Chameleon's &#34;Strange Times&#34; and thought it lacked a little.<br />This is by far their best effort.
B00CWY76CC|5.0|Lots of fun.  I was just going to try it out, and I ended up playing it for over an hour.  Good one for problem solvers.
B005ZOBNOI|4.0|Wonderfully sad and horribly optimistic. Hazel and Gus are imperfect people who compliment one another perfectly. The story would be a disaster without either of the two leads.No words.
B0055S348W|4.0|Super easy to use and prints perfectly. The only thing is I wish it could connect to all emails and not just gmail, otherwise it would be a 5 star rating. Yep, it's that good.
B0040GUIAC|5.0|having seen this movie so many times, the one thing i truly loved, was the music. i have the soundtrack on cassette(yup, i'm that old :) lol) and wanted to be able to put it on my mp2. this is whitney at her best. i am very happy to have this.
B00CH87HF4|2.0|I loved dungeon hunter 3 and still play it. I was really excited to see a new one. I downloaded it on my kindle fire hd because i have a 32GB version and this game takes up a lot of space. As it is now the game is too buggy to get through too much playtime. Im going to keep it installed though and wait for the update because im sure itll play great eventually. Right now? Not so great
B009G7ZYPY|5.0|I love her voice and this DVD is marvelous.  I enjoy it over a glass of wine with friends and dinner.
B00B29J0I6|1.0|I don't remember purchasing this item and not sure I did. If so I can't rate it.Maybe the girls did??
B0001I561E|5.0|Our two grandchildren ages 7 and 4 really enjoyed watching this movie, as this is one of the Disney Classics they had never seen.
145210655X|5.0|. Joy As a father of a 4 yr old girl, I can say this book is absolutely perfe ct
B0097UGXFK|5.0|This movie does justice to the book and the acting is great.  It's a good movie to revisit before the second Hunger Game is released in Novemaber.
B001GCUNYO|5.0|This is a great movie to watch. The action is wonderful. I would recommend this movie to any oine who likes this type of thrill ride.
B00BOLFRKW|5.0|Nice story you rarely hear or see. Watched with my daughter, 12 yo, just in time for civil war history
B002ECN4P0|5.0|It's just hard not to love these famous hits of the Stones, especially if you're as big of a fan as me.
B004YF6MHW|1.0|Theoretically, this may be a perfectly serviceable camera app. However, it is rendered useless because you must be actively logged in to Amazon or it won't take a picture. The whole point of a smartphone camera is to be able to take pictures a moment's notice. Worst purchased app ever.
B00DHRLK84|1.0|The good thing is that the BluRay audio and video were fine.  Lots of surround action, (looking behind me for those helicopters for example) room shaking explosions, clear dialog.  As for everything else...wasn't worth the money. After all of the good stuff Brad Pitt did how did he wind up doing this movie?<br />I should have known better than to expect a super-hyped-up-on-TV movie to live up to it's ads.<br />It was eagerly awaited but I won't even bother watching the 3D version.  Maybe the movie was OK if you are a Zombie fanatic (I am not)....The Zombies were pretty scary, but I'll take any and all of the Resident Evil movies over this one.<br />Try renting it or viewing it on line before you buy it.
B007SGLZP8|5.0|Great mystery and suspense.  Never sure where book was headed.  The end was a pleasant surprise.  I enjoyed this book.
B00C7TAF3Y|5.0|I really enjoyed playing this game. I even had the rest of my family start playing on their electronic device's. Only down fall is I wish it was longer.
0891419063|5.0|Inspiring read of our Greatest Generation  and I agree this might be the best WWII book by a veteran yet.
B009LQKHIO|1.0|I found this book to be boring and poorly written. There was no real rise in action or strong conflict. It was so predictable too. The dialogue was forced and unrealistic, the same can be said for the characters. There were many mistakes throughout the book as well.<br /><br />I should have stopped reading this book early on but stuck with it hoping it would get better. It didn't.
B00EY8BRGU|5.0|If you enjoy thought-provoking, intense movies with lots of twists, you will love this movie. If you're looking for something to put on the screen while you do other stuff, wait until you have time to sit down and pay attention. Even if you don't typically enjoy \\"magic shows\\" this movie is riveting. It has suspense, thrills, a heist, plenty of chase scenes and action, some romantic tension, great special effects, and a surprise ending that is very satisfying. There is already buzz about a sequel, since this film had a budget of about 75 million and made 300 million in the box office. I highly recommend this movie for just about any situation. It makes a great date movie, is family-friendly, and can spark some interesting moral debate.
B008JGSM6G|3.0|This game did capture my attention for a while.  You do get a bit of a challenge, but after a while I found it a bit boring.
B00CJGP116|5.0|Omg....best ever! it's about time Marc Anthony did this I love his music so much we want more. I want to meet this very talented man one day and I know I will
B0063IH60K|5.0|Spending to much time playing.  I think it is easier than when you play with real cards.  I seem to win a lot.
B0067TGSOK|5.0|The author really get your business juices flowing! He makes you feel like &#34;I CAN do this&#34;!<br />Very inspirational and has re-lit my fire and desire to become a entrepreneur!
B006LSZECO|1.0|After reading some good reviews, I really wanted to like this book. I'm sad to say I think it might be one of the worst books I have ever read. Too much of the characters thinking, the explaining of clues. The plot became so outrageous toward the end it was totally unbelievable. I also didn't care for the turn to gross sex talk. And then the guy takes her back? Are you kidding me? And there's no ending? Thank goodness I got this from the library! Live and learn, I guess this author is not for me.
B00CZAYNOC|5.0|i love five finger death punch. this cd was one of the best. even tho it had some ok songs
B008DVJO8C|5.0|I have all of In This Moments Albums, and in my opinion each Album is better than the Last one they put out
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|The game is cute and fun and keeps my little one entertained.The graphics are really nice and bright.<br />Two Thumbs Up!
B00D7Z4GQY|5.0|Liane Moriarty writes with humor and understanding. I loved all her characters with and without their flaws. She writes a truly believable story.
0316010669|5.0|I have recommended Blink to friends and professionals who are interested in the mechanisms of the brain. It is a richly described and well researched journey into the role of the subconscious in thinking. Malcom Gladwell describes a pattern-recognition process that operates just below the surface of awareness and brings us insight through a process he describes as &#34;rapid cognition&#34; or &#34;thin slicing.&#34; It is a fascinating book.
B005T87QCI|3.0|Needs A Lot More because you have to buy robots  so you don't have the  main robots&middot; like Atom or Zeus
B005CRQ4XI|2.0|This was the local book club choice for September. Reading it was difficult, as the author/main character is not appealing nor does one feel anything but negative emotions from her narration.  She seems so self absorbed and the writing style is so unpleasant I simply cannot understand why this is such a \\"successful\\" book. Six of nine in our group felt this way. Disappointing is an understatement.
030758836X|3.0|If this wasn't a selection of my community book club I would not have read this book.<br /><br />I have mixed feelings about Gone Girl.<br /><br />I found the first section of the book to be tedious.  I didn't care for the way the author flipped back and forth between the current events and the journal.<br /><br />In my opinion it did get better toward the middle of the book, but I think if the author had divided the first section into two, one for the current events and one for the journal, I would have found it more interesting.
B00F91H15W|4.0|This film deserves extra praise for avoiding any trace of glamorizing or demonizing these teenagers.  Spoiled brats who have caused trouble are lumped together in one cushy school. They grew up with conspicuous spending everywhere and few consequences.  Flashy things, rebellion, and drugs alleviate boredom both for them and many of the celebrities they worship.
B00CSR2J9I|5.0|Great game really enjoy it!!! But the only problem is that some of the animals are really hard to get over when driving without flipping
B008AK8FHM|4.0|I enjoyed his book. The story he shared while in the coma was riveting. However, the medical explantions were way over my head. I would tell people to simply focus about his journey while in the coma.
B005D9MUWY|5.0|It culls predictions from Gmail, Facebook, your messaging history twitter etc. I always seem to be missing the space bar but that could be an id10t error, occurs between wrists and tips of fingers of this old school physical keyboard lover. Love the themes and great language support. I've used this app for almost two years, highly suggest. Also has great Swype feature for those special times when the keys don't seem to stand still on their own.Just give em fingers a swirl and who rreally cares what come up anyways.
B00EC7GRS6|4.0|Pro:<br />- Simple to use<br />- Makes your Z Ultra look like a Bravia TV<br />- Magnetic charging convenience<br />- Avoid wearing off the rubber sealing of the charger flap; peace of mind for water resistance<br /><br />Cons<br />- Money grab, extremely overpriced - should be half the price, or it should include a built in speaker for multimedia at this price<br />- Design should include detachable USB cable as one provided is too short<br />- Instructions does not show the correct way of using your dock (see below)<br /><br />To the other reviewer:<br />- You are correct the port does not line up if the phone is docked \\"straight in\\"<br />- The proper way to dock it: Dock your phone with the magnetic port off-center, and then slide it into the middle of the dock. When you hear the \\"click\\", it connects perfectly every time.
B009NOVCTM|5.0|I bought this for my 80 Year Old Mom for XMas last year and she totally loves it, and so do I, and everytime we are around one another the Stones are playing!!!
B007SPPANM|5.0|This is my favorite version of the titanic. In my opinion the others versions aren't even close to being as good as this one.
B00B2V66VS|5.0|I downloaded this game for my children but guess who has been playing. I am ashamed to say just how much fun it is. Get it.you will like it.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|I swear this is the best book I have ever read I 100 percent loved it AND IN can't wait to read th next
B00DJFIMW6|2.0|I have only played 2 or 3 times, but find it very hard to control the running minion. I will give it a few more chances before I delete it from my Kindle.
B005LAIIN0|4.0|This is a good movie that can stand on its own. It has nothing to do with the book and is WWZ in name only.  That being said, I docked it for that.  The unrated version is really decent.  It was a fast paced movie and came in at a little over 2 hours.  I liked the story and if not for the pesky name it would have been 5 stars in my book.  The story is good, the acting is good and the special effects are extremely well done.  It looks pretty real.  I would watch it again in a heartbeat and just might if I can get my projector working.  this is a big movie and you need to watch it on the biggest screen you can find.  The bluray is crisp and is really nice.  I like the fact you get a digital copy with this as well as a regular DVD.  This really is a good deal.  I paid 20 bucks for opening week sales and that I feel was a great price.  Pick it up, watch the movie and just dont consider the name.  You will be pleased.
B0029LCJJS|5.0|I love the Tudors.. Excellent acting full of passion!! The King is so handsome and so is his close friend the duke.. All the clothing and jewels that they all wear is so visually beautiful that I am just in awe.. Love the history even though very difficult to watch some of the violent things they do to each other..a lot of scheming going on and especially in the Ann Bolin family!! Love the original Queen and her undying love and commitment to the King. Would hate the King for all is playing around but can't take my eyes off him because he is so gorgeous and how powerfully he plays his part.. I hope the Tudors will be around for many more seasons~
B0054XOMX4|5.0|Read the reviews here on Amazon for the Beyblades, this Orion, spins the longest, grandson loved it!<br />Beats the L-Drago every time !
B008JGSM6G|5.0|Myself and my family really enjoy this game. I have children from 7 to 20 and they all can play this. I would recommend this game to anyone!!
B007EECSFA|5.0|I love this book all the twist and turns very good book I will tell my co-readers they will love this book
0143038419|4.0|I like the eat and pray parts better that the love part....she gave a bit too much information in that section....a good book to read and well written...
030758836X|4.0|This is a great book, no doubt about that. As you can see, most readers have been very pleased with this book, and for good reason. The writing is crisp and authentic, the story keeps you guessing, up until the middle (which the author intended), and the momentum is fantastic. Really, a very compelling story from start to finish. Having said that, it would seem that a five-star rating would have been appropriate, and this novel did nearly win a five-star rating from me...nearly. Unfortunately, the end left much to be desired. In fact, I'm not sure I've ever read such a well written book, with such gripping characters, that fell so short in the end.<br /><br />I sped through the last few chapters, certain the end would live up to the rest of the book. I couldn't wait to see the appropriate character get what they deserved, and boy, certain characters deserved a truckload of payback, only that didn't happen. It's as though the author just...well...kind of lulled in the end, maybe not certain how to conclude her story. I mean: come on! Such horrid, vapid, awful, exquisitely written characters, and in the end, nothing happens. Nothing at all. Gillian Flynn takes us on this magnificent ride--makes us feel so much for these people, and so much hatred for certain characters--only  to bring us to a slow, anticlimactic ending.<br /><br />All in all, this book is great. I just wish the ending had offered up some kind of conclusion.
0800141660|4.0|I enjoy the story line...love the manners and the setting....the beautiful views.....love the outfits the characters wear....I'm glad I purchased the movie...
0439023521|5.0|The Hunger Games by Suzanne Collins is an amazing book! I couldn't put it down! The book takes place in the future and shows how the central government is run. There are no cities but everything is divided into \\"Districts.\\" Once a year each district has to draw name (teen male and female) from a glass to pick who will fight in the annual Hunger Games. The Hunger Games is a certain setting that the government chooses and where the teens will fight to the death. Only one person wins. Whoever isn't killed and is the last standing wins. Although when the main character Katniss Everdeen volunteers things change drastically! The whole time I could not put the book down! Great read.<br /><br />Even though the book is in the future and is realistic fiction it makes you wonder what our government might be like. The idea of having our government send teens to fight to the death is not only eye opening but very interesting to see take place in a book. The author uses vivid description you almost want to laugh, cry, and smile just like the characters! You almost feel like you are in the book. Logically and emotionally the book appealed to me right from the dirt paragraph! I instantly made a connection with the book that I had never with any other book.<br /><br />The amount of description that was used in the book was amazing. The book was very suspenseful  considering the fact teens were forced to kill each other. You not only have the action- adventure element you have the romance between the main characters and the intense situations each character must face. There wasn't  a second where I ever doubted choosing to read the book. I never wanted it to be over! Overall I highly recommend this book and hope anyone who decides to read it enjoys the book as much as I did.

B00F8L2VO4|5.0|This app is awesome! I took French for four years in high school, but was really sad when I realized I don't remember a lot of what I'd learned. I stumbled upon this and I'm in love. Easy to use, kinda fun, and I'm able to refresh all of what I knew before. Excited to show my sister, who is currently in a French class, when I see her next time :)

B00BEZTMFY|4.0|It is a good movie but not as good as the first 3 movies.The biggest gripe I have with the movie was the Goblin King.He could speak fluid English and played like an out of place joke in the movie.I am a huge LOR fan and I hope the new Director of the next 3 movie sequels will pay more attention to detail.I would have gave it 3 1/2 stars if I was to truly rated it properly.

B00B7PIRIE|4.0|This is a good product, with one VERY big problem - it has subtitles, and no mention of this was made when previewing the item on line. Fortunately, I have a portable DVD player that has the function to remove the subtitles. If it weren't for the subtitles, I would have rated this product with 5 stars.
B00AEBB8XS|4.0|As expected, it has good image quality, and good audio in english track. Spanish, instead, is latino, not castllian. Recommended anyway.

Josh Homme has restored my faith in rock. Good, hard, honest rock. Damn it! A+
0399157565|4.0|I love Patricia Cornwell's Scarpetta series, and have read each one. This one was not the best, but still a good read. As per the pattern, it builds to a suspenseful climax toward the end, when you think there is not going to be enough pages left to finish the story.
B00B7Y0206|2.0|It was very hard to use and it would not enlargened the way I would want it to. Plus the videos that I wanted to watch did not load at all or I had to wait about 3 and 1/2 minutes just to get it to work and it would still lag.
B00E8KLWB4|5.0|It's hard to believe a game this good is really free. You can purchase things within the game, but they're all things you can live, and keep playing this game, without. That's rare to find in &quot;free&quot; games. The graphics are good, it's more challenging as you progress, mini games are fun and challenging. It's a full length game and if it wasn't free I'd actually pay for this one. I wish there were more like it. I'd be happy to have to sit through commercials for games of this quality.
B00CUWWLWG|1.0|IT WOULDNT EVEN LOAD THE GAME AND IT IS A WASTE OF YOUR SPACE. YOU HAVE TO WAIT LIKE 2 HOURS AND IT WOULD NOT STILL LOAD! SO MAD!!!! &#62;.&#60;

0385394233|3.0|I am a retired Engineer and a woman. I am sure that the author meant well. She is coming from a whole other perspective. I know that women are powerful in business and in our government. We still need to catch up in the pay department. When I see the pay scale equal I will be satisfied. I could take or leave this book. Nice try though. I suppose because there are so many better women behind not so great men. I am talking from my perspective after working in Silicon Valley for 25 years.

I can promise you that you will not be disappointed. I am not going to say another word, I would just be wasting your time....time that could be well spent enjoying a superb book.
B007WFR0QS|5.0|I first heard Emeli Sande with Labrinth on the song Beneath Your Beautiful and was so enchanted I had to find more.  I bought this CD and love every song on it.  The songs are so beautiful, so soulful and so heartfelt and her voice is just unbelievable.  She seems a classy and intelligent woman and it shows in her music.  \\"Where I sleep\\" is probably my favorite on the album but honestly none of them disappoint. Probably the most widely known song on this is \\"Next to Me\\".  But for pure, soulful sound, you also can't beat \\"River\\" or \\"Heaven\\".  I know I'm gushing and sorry if it's too effusive for some but I honestly can't think of an artist in recent years who can compare to Ms. Sande in terms of songwriting and voice.  It's also pretty cool to read that she postponed her music career to study and get a degree in medicine so there are brains behind the face and voice.
B00B7Y0206|1.0|This app has bugs on it once you start to use the app for a little while there's bugs and it starts to blink so don't get it
B00F91RYL8|2.0|There are a few positive elements in this movie, but very few....mostly just lots of violence and fear - and the end seems rather ridiculous.
B0083Z614S|4.0|This book was really good although some of the languages were tough. I would recommend this book to any one!
B007712XAU|5.0|Love it; Probably have suggested it to 30 or more folks and they have all loved it.  Thank you for your great service.  It arrived in record time.
0142420891|1.0|This sequel to \\"If I Stay\\" was a real disappointment.  Mia and Adam have been propelled to stardom in their separate musical careers and reunite after a couple of years one evening.  The characters are totally one dimensional, especially Mia, who just kind of wanders around for most of the book making observations about New York City.  Adam is the stereotypical rock star jaded and disillusioned by fame.  You don't get any sense of their supposed connection to one another, they seem very emotionless.  Honestly I wouldn't even bother reading this book.  If I Stay didn't need a sequel and this really doesn't do it justice.
B000053W52|1.0|Buyer beware. The DVD will not play in the USA. A message on screen states will not play in this region. Do not purchase. Waste of time and money.
B008XBCJ34|5.0|maybe in the future it will a Extended Edition with the 3D Blu-ray, but right now if you're fortunate enough to have a 3D-TV you can only get the 3D version which includes the 3D Theatrical version and DVD theatrical version combo but WITHOUT special features... if you want to get the Extremely desirable bonus discs with the \\"behind the scenes\\", \\"deleted scenes\\", \\"The technology behind\\" etc. bonus you have to buy the Extended edition Box Set which is NOT THE 3D version, ... so you wound up buying to Box Sets of the same movie!!!!! WTF?
B009KS4XRO|5.0|Love this game, one of the better free bingo games. Unlike some of the other games where you have to play for an age before you get rewards etc which can make it boring, this game isn't like that. It gives spaced out rewards.
B0040I09RM|5.0|Love the twists and turns Kurt Sutter puts the viewers through.  Very adult programming, not for children at all.  Great acting
0789420708|5.0|I look forward to reading this classic to my grandkids this holiday season. I think every family should have a copy of this book.
B005CRQ4GU|3.0|The whole book is about one event, and I got a little bored with it. All though it is Jeff Kinney, I would rate this one of my least favorite books by him.

1250030951|5.0|Can Rainbow Rowell do no wrong? I think the answer to that question is yes.<br /><br />I read Eleanor & Park earlier this year and absolutely loved it. So when I heard Rowell had another YA coming out, I had to have it. And with so many rave reviews, I knew it had to be good. Someone even told me people were saying it was better than Eleanor & Park. I was skeptical at that--could Rowell top that? Then I read the book and MY GOSH, I think she could. And did.<br /><br />I'm going to talk about all things Fangirl soon, but let me talk about it with Eleanor & Park for a second. They're both spectacular in the way of Rowell's wonderful writing and stellar storytelling and craftful characters. But where they're different (and why I may like Fangirl more, but still LOVE E&P) is their mood, so to speak. E&P is a bit more serious, not quite so light and fluffy (but not dark and depressing, either). Fangirl, on the other hand, is more light and fluffy, but still has some seriousness. It's like they have the same things, but each focuses more on a different one. And it shows how eclectic Rowell is in her writing, but how she can still be herself. (And I have got to read Attachments, her adult book, which is bound to be great like her YA books.)<br /><br />Now, for Fangirl. I'll start off with what I didn't like...which is basically nothing. For the longest time, I kept thinking to myself, \\"there is nothing wrong with this book.\\" Of course, nothing is perfect, and I did end up finding a few things I didn't love--some open-endness (sorta) and the ending, because it wasn't satisfying enough. (Oh my gosh, are flips-the-pages-over-and-over-is-that-really-the-end endings Rowell's trademark? She's going to destroy me. (In a good way.)) And really, that's mainly because I wanted MORE. When I first looked at my copy of Fangirl, I noticed two things: kind of thick and small font. (Plus the cover, of course, and it was cool how well it matched the book, i.e., I'm pretty sure the characters wear what they're wearing on the cover.) And I thought, \\"WHY?\\" Because that's kind of intimidating and I've been in a book slump and all that, you know. But then I read it and that didn't matter, because there weren't enough words. I needed MORE. Also, at one point, a thought randomly occurred to me: I kind of want to DNF (did not finish) this book. Why would I think such a thing about this book? It's complicatedly simple: I didn't want it to end, and by not finishing it, the book would never be over.<br /><br />As for the Simon Snow chapters/section (from the book and Cath's fanfiction), well...Rainbow Rowell, if you're reading this, I'm sorry to have skipped such a big part of your lovely book. I read them for a while, but eventually I just got so invested in Cath's story that I couldn't take the time to read Simon Snow parts; I just skipped ahead to see what was happening with Cath's story. (And I may have peeked ahead on more than one occasion, but I just had to see what my feels would be feeling and when. Had to. Though I wish I wouldn't have cheated and seen some of those feels a little early.)<br /><br />You know what's great about Fangirl? (Everything.) The characters. Rowell is really good at writing characters that just feel real. It's told from the POV of Cath, a college freshman with a twin sister named Wren. Oh, and she's a hardcore Simon Snow fan and writes fanfiction about him. I think part of why I loved this book so much was because I saw so many similarities between myself and Cath and I was able to connect with her. Her and her sister Wren, while they may look alike, are opposites in many ways. Wren's the partier, while Cath stays in her dorm room and writes. I didn't care for their mother, but I liked their dad. I also liked Cath's roommate Reagan--another opposite from Cath, but she's really cool. And then, there's Levi. Levi, Levi, Levi. I love you. (Here and here and here.) He's such an awesome guy who's wonderful yet not perfect (he does make mistakes). He kind of reminded me of Etienne St. Clair and Augustus Waters, but he was still his own character. I could probably talk forever about him, but I'll control myself. And the romance in the novel...sa-WOON. Rowell can make practically nothing make you swoon (like the hand holding in E&P). It's just wonderful. (Also, quick note: Some people categorize this as New Adult because of the MC's age. In case you were wondering, if it's NA, it's not NA in the sex sense.)<br /><br />Oh gosh, what else can I say? How about...<br /><br />Rainbow Rowell could write a book about two garbage cans falling in love and I would read it.<br /><br />At the end of a rainbow, is there a never-ending pot full of Rainbow Rowell books for me to read?<br /><br />In the end (I wish there wasn't an end. In fact, Rowell should write sequels to Fangirl), I can't give enough praise for this book. I felt great reading it. I loved it. I kind of want to (kindly) say you'd be a fool not to read it. It may be my favorite book of the year. I want to reread it already. I want you to read it. It's a feel-good book, and it's a gives-you-feels book. I am simply fangirling over Fangirl.<br /><br />Rainbow Rowell has done it again, and don't be surprised when she does it again. And again. And again.
B0099Y2YL6|5.0|Excellent show in beautiful blu-ray. Very entertaining. Wonderfully acted and the costumes and scenes are absolutely beautiful.  I would highly recommend this show if you like British shows about love and loss, rich and poor, or historical fiction.
B004GJYR7I|5.0|this movie is hilarious.  definitely one of my favorites.  my sister and i quote it all the time.  what a great pair
B00CEF014E|1.0|Let me begin by saying that I am an author, too. I understand the resistance to changing \\"your baby.\\" We have all been there. But trust me, the editor is your friend. This book has a great concept with a lot of potential. Unfortunately, the writing leaves so much to be desired that I was not able to enter the world of the story in a meaningful way. The stylistic errors kept breaking the fourth wall for me. Please get an editor to go over this book. Then re-write it. You will be glad that you did.<br /><br />1 POV- learn to use it. You cannot simply shift POVs so abruptly, and the character POV can only comment on what the character can see or experience.<br />2 Descriptions- don't simply use a thesaurus to spice up your adjectives. I was laughing at some descriptions of the car, such as \\"scuzzy\\" and \\"smutty\\". Instead of using a single word, why not create a similie? Instead of \\"smutty car\\" you could say, \\"Crusts of dirt hung like barnacles on the battered Honda.\\" Or something, obviously not what I just wrote because that sucked, but just for an example.<br />3 grammar- make sure that your clause modifies the proper subject.<br />4- characters-if you name them, try to develop them, if you don't plan to develop them, don't name them and then keep using the names later. It is too confusing<br />5-realism-you can only suspend so much disbelief. If freakish things occur in your book, try to make the \\"non-freakish\\" things believable. For example, if I am going to believe the bizarre scenario (no spoiler) don't try to make me believe that the cat will rip the rapist's face off to protect her mistress. Trust me, kitties don't do that kind of thing. There was just way, way, way too much going on at the end. Way too much. Way. Too. Much. I was just so done.<br />6-Don't say things like \\"the doctor was a Nazi\\" in such a realistic way if he a)is not a Nazi, b)has zero significant role in the story c)does nothing bad. You ramp up the tension with the doctor in the first page, and that is the end of the doctor, why did you even include this? And the old lady, what was that for?<br />7-consistency- Don't say that the sky is \\"black\\" with rain and then in the next paragraph moments later say that the car was being burned by the bright sun. Did you notice what you just said in the last paragraph? And not to even mention that drought is a main feature of the book? If the rain is happening far far away, make it clear that a long distance has been traveled. Please remove inconsistencies.<br /><br />I am not being harsh, just being honest. I think this book can be great. It really can. But please get input and re-work it. Remove unnecessary characters. Remove the veiny eye in the eyehole. Make the slow sinster thing come on much more slowly. Allow the characters to progress. If you need to pay someone to go over the book, do so. Then, follow the advice. A writer's group will also help a lot. Good luck and this is an awesome start.d that is the end of the doctor, why did you even include this?

B008YCMM2A|5.0|Just listened to all 4 CD's while on a long drive. Can't wait to watch the DVD! Bitches Brew was the first &#34;fusion&#34; recording I ever heard; and as ground-breaking and great as that record was, it sometimes sounds a bit cluttered. Here is a document of the same material with his core quintet of that time and the music stands up beautifully in it's &#34;stripped down&#34; version. Plus, this is a transition from the Tony Williams/Ron Carter/Herbie Hancock quintet of the ESP and Nefertiti period, retaining Wayne Shorter on this tour. Wayne is in fine free-form here; on both tenor and soprano. In my view, this is where Wayne set new benchmarks on the soprano. Miles is in great from here - I would say he was at his peak in terms of technique. Sound quality isn't perfect, but amazing for a &#34;bootleg&#34;. Highly recommended.

B00E8B1P9M|5.0|In many ways it was better than the first and I like that fine as well. I will probably buy it.
B003Z0BWR2|3.0|Cassandra Clare's second book in The Mortal Instruments series, City of Ashes, finds the whole gang, Jace, Clary, Simon, Alec, and Isabelle back together - if only they had The Mystery Machine and a dog named Scooby.  To be completely honest, I did not like the beginning of this book.  I found Jace's character to be completely obnoxious, and it almost caused me to set the book down and say farewell to the series.  However, I'm glad I didn't as the story really comes to life as the group finds themselves in a new adventure that is once again intertwined with the evil Valentine.<br /><br />In the first book, City of Bones, Valentine comes to New York city to find the first of three Mortal Instruments, the mortal cup.  With the cup in his grasp, he has returned in the second book to find the next mortal instrument, the mortal sword.  Now this is no Excalibur that shines through the water's surface being held by the Lady of the Lake.  Instead, it is a sword of immense power that can force the Shadowhunter who holds it to tell the truth. However, Valentine has other plans for the sword, plans that hold dark and demonic powers.<br /><br />Once again, it is up to Clary and Jace to battle Valentine with the help of their friends.  Through all this, Jace is dealing with his own demons, trying to figure out who he really is.  While Clary is trying to understand why her mother, who is still stuck in a coma, has never told her about being a Shadowhunter and the special powers she is just starting to discover.<br /><br />Overall, I would recommend this book as I enjoyed the story.  However, as stated above, I did not like the beginning.  I have read the third book in the series as well, City of Glass, and I feel the second book, City of Ashes, is a must read if you'd like to continue on in The Mortal Instruments series.
B003YL4LYI|5.0|So many many storylines and not enough depth!!! This was a great continuance, but when you reach the end it lol eaves you burning! A great ploy to be sure but George better get his pen in gear and finish this!
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|my niece really really  love this game she plays it all night and day I have to go shut it down or off....
B000XUBFE2|5.0|Recommended by a friend. I did not know of it's illustrious history on best sellers lists. I love this book. Never wanted it to end.  So wonderful to read a personal story from world war two from a German child's perspective. I have often wondered how it was for the German people who could not escape Hitler's plans for their lives.
B007EC27QM|5.0|nice to have handy any time.. I always need one when i'm in the store  and really at the shop n save
B005ZOBNOI|4.0|Quick easy read and a really Good book! I laughed, I cried, I got angry. What a Horrible ending though.
B0091REZMW|4.0|Really addictive game with good graphics and easy gameplay<br />, though would be better if diamonds were easier to get rather than buy

B009NFHF0Q|2.0|I enjoyed The Book of Lost Things by John Connolly and this book seemed to echo the themes of Connolly's book of a boy struggling with a traumatic event and being taken to an alternate fable world to learn lessons of growing up. But the characters in Gaiman's book are painted with such broad strokes that I find little connection with any of them. This book may make a good graphic novel as many have indicated was originally intended as a short story or maybe even a screen play but as a stand alone novel...meh. On a final note, many reviewers have mentioned Gaiman's \\"beautiful\\" writing style, and I agree that Gaiman has an interesting voice, but this novel is lazy at best with descriptions throughout the novel and amateurish at his worst.
B007PJLUG2|5.0|I never do reviews, but I have to say this is one of my favorite movies ever! A feel good movie!
6304712499|3.0|Good movie for comic book fans.  John Leguizamo was awesome in it and we would watch it again. Not the best movie but a good movie for a Saturday afternoon when nothing is on tv.
B009JZSC9S|5.0|5 stars for casting: Julianna Margulies, Josh Charles, and Chris Noth (the love triangle). Charles (Will) is the man that stands between Margulies and Noth (the Florricks).<br />5 stars for a strong storyline and great characters<br />The show is about politics, deception, family, and survival.
B000DWMYQ8|4.0|While my husband and I are in our 40's, Disney films are still some of our faves.  Chicken Little is just so cute and funny and we love how it ends.  A feel good movie that will make you smile.
B00DZV15FU|1.0|Petty, shallow characters living lives that are not worth the 99 cents i paid for this book.  Why its a classic is beyond  me.  What an insult to womanhood.
B00005N6KG|1.0|I used to buy 5-6 of these headphones at a time on Amazon or at Target for my autistic son's MP3, at about $8.  Now I see you can only get these direct from Sony, at $45????  Believe me, these are worth no more than $8.  My son used to break one at least every other week.  I also used to buy the Sony Sports headphones for about $15, now they are selling for $50-60???<br />What kind of scam is Sony pulling with this?  Do they figure that people ordering these so dislike ear buds that they will pay anything?<br />For now I'm substituting the Koss headphones, which are selling for around $6 and are just as good, which means just as cheap.
B00DR0PDNE|4.0|Kind of a fun device.  If you load the app you can run Netflix or YouTube from you phone or tablet to your TV.  If you use Google Chrome you can project what is on you screen to your TV.  Kind of nice if you have a large screen. This works from your computer, not your phone or table.  You can also project your desktop once you figure out how.  Just open Chrome, then click on the cast button, choose the little down arrow on the right then choose cast desktop.  I assume it will get better in the future as they add more  channels to the app.
B00CH26TL8|5.0|Play this game against your friends, and forget paying like candy crush and being overwhelmed. Works great work kindle hd
B000AAF1U4|5.0|Good clean fun for everyone, with great acting, good animation, and plenty of witty dialogue this movie is a must have for anyone looking for fun
B008CPAVZO|1.0|The premise is pretty good but production value and acting reminded me of a college film. Just not worth watching.
B0036S4B6M|3.0|Not my usual genre but kept me reading hours into the night/day.  Freedom is definitely something we take for granted, Pipers description of prison life and losing her freedom during her time in prison really brings that to light.
B004XCUEU2|5.0|It's emotional, educational, and inspirational; pretty much everything school is trying to be. If ever you've wanted to know more about the band, this is for you.
B00B7Y0206|5.0|No problems whatsoever for my nerves and kindle fire. I am so glad I spent so much wasted time to learn dos.
B00F1BFRA6|5.0|Can't wait til next season starts. Love the show. Even better than Upstairs -Downstairs.:-) :-) :-) :-) :-) great story lines. Hope that it continues for a long time.
140006922X|3.0|This was an entertaining light read on religious history. Sometimes disjointed, light on facts in some areas and prone to repetition. Still a good read for the masses. Not as heavy and dry as a collegiate biblical text. It only affirmed my beliefs on the power of religious spin-masters to craft a story and image of a person to suit their needs (I'm speaking of the church). Don't be afraid to pick it up.
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|I love this game because it is so addicting and if you love temple run and subway surfers then you will love this game!!!! But you would never love it more then I do!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!

B005K17RU0|5.0|Great app! Very accurate forecasts, presented in very easy to use and interpret visuals! Use it and trust it daily. Really like the hour by hour breakout for the current day. I am a professional meteorologist myself...and this is my weather app of choice!
B00821OX98|4.0|It's ok... tv shows are not supposed to be a Cecil B DeMille production epic... well, some are, but this one is not.
0307271609|4.0|Jung Chang, the brilliant author of \\"Wild Swans\\", has researched the life of Empress Dowager<br />Cixi, the last significant ruler of the Manchu Dynasty, and found that most of the facts we believe about Cixi are wrong, and that she was portrayed as evil by later governments, both democratic and communist, to justify their actions.  These more recent governments took credit for her modernizations, like ending foot-binding.<br /><br />It is difficult for those of use who know little about Chinese history to imagine the world in which Cixi lived, given to the Emperor as a concubine at 12, in the middle of the 19th century.  China was so lost in itself that the idea that there were other nations of equal or superior status to themselves was horrifying.  Yet by the end of her rule in 1908 she was ready to openly copy Western constitutional monarchies, turn her subjects into citizens, and<br />start providing clean water, electricity, a postal system, and literacy to her people.  In<br />1908 fewer than 1% of the Chinese were literate in Chinese.  Cixi had to rule a country she could not see or meet until she was forced to flee Beijing because of European invaders.  Until then she was shut into the harem and the palace, and could not meet European men or any commoners other than the eunuchs who served her.  Autocrat that she was, she could not break custom or the extreme formality of her life.  Perhaps it was her frustration with her emotionally barren life that led her to warm feelings of sisterhood with other women.<br /><br />The author makes it clear that she is a fan of Cixi, despite her mistakes and her brutality.<br />I found the book tough going, as I know very little of China in the era between the Opium War and 1908.  Most Western history focuses on the ports controlled by Western countries, not on the vast majority of imperial China.  But I'm very glad that I read it, and I recommend it highly to anyone interested in the development of modern China.  The illustrations are great, and there are nearly 80 pages of bibliography and index at the end.
B00005AREQ|4.0|Definitely a must for those who appreciate the true talent of Jeff Beck, and his original music.  Have been a fan of his since the 1960's; he gets better with age.
B00F35BV64|5.0|I am really impressed with the actor they picked for Dr. Mcoy, he has the voice down pat and actions.  I was concerned about the love affair between spock and ohura sp, the original series never aluded to this.
B000OZ0NXA|5.0|Great novel. Never guessed the ending. Just ordered more Jack Reacher. I can keep writing but it seems silly to do so is that enough words
B005KQVDH8|5.0|Ever have that experience where you go back and watch a movie that you LOVED as a child, but realize it was never really that good? Well, The Goonies is NOT one of those movies! It's as great of a watch as it ever was!<br /><br />You '80s kids need to watch it with your kids.<br /><br />But watch out for the Booty-Traps!
B004KBSQOW|4.0|.Relaxing Sounds that is easy to listen to and that is soothing and calming and puts you in a quiet state of mind
B00BWRT4KM|5.0|I prefer brunettes. But Barbara Eden is the exception that proves the rule.<br /><br />Barbara Eden is one of those \\"sex symbols\\" that understands her mission well.  Somehow, she is good, and bad, simultaneously. Few female actresses know how to do this. Racquel Welch, Sophia Loren come to mind.<br /><br />Very entertaining, lots of fun for the whole family (not just dad).
B009KS4XRO|3.0|It's a fun bingo game. But they promise all sorts of extra credits and such via your FB page and you very rarely get any.
B008RA3X5E|5.0|On all my devices. Helps me in my time management. Interface allows flexability and color choices.Glad it meets those functions
B004YW4L5K|4.0|I have to read this book again. But I may have to wait until I read a book about ancient mythology - I think I would have gotten more out of it. The references to gods from multiple cultures were hit or miss for me just because I didn't recognize some of them. I'll revisit at some point with more experience.<br /><br />The human characters were pretty compelling and the author did a really good job of moving my knowledge along with the main character's experience. Sometimes a main character is required to have skills the reader can't hope to duplicate but in this case I felt like I was going step by step with him and we were both learning as we went.<br /><br />The idea of gods being made by our beliefs and how those gods grow, change, and whither as time progresses was something I really enjoyed. Us making our own gods out of our &#34;worship&#34; and sacrifice, but not necessarily as we would think about the Ancient Greeks worshiping Zeus, rung especially true as I watched some of the Emmys broadcast the other night. There was a Don Cheadle segment where he reviewed the year 1963 in terms of television history. Martin Luther King Jr's speech, the JFK assassination, and the Beatles on Ed Sullivan were his highlights. The part that made me pause was where he exalted television for bringing this to us and he really did seem...like he was asking us to worship the television industry for everything that it's been a part of. This is especially interesting considering that TV as we know it is changing and in some ways dying.
B00E8KLWB4|5.0|The games are fun and challenging. The energy part sucks, but overall not bad. Finding things throughout the game are interesting. The storyline is weird
B006BFK5DK|4.0|This past weekend I saw Earth, Wind & Fire in concert for the first time (more on that later). Just a few weeks ago EW&F released a new studio album, their first in 8 years.<br /><br />\\"Now, Then & Forever\\" (10 tracks; 42 min.) is frontloaded with the best songs on the album: it starts off with a jamming \\"Sign On\\" and the first reaction is that the band's 'classic' sound of the 1970s has been resurrected, now 40 years later. This is even more prounounded on the next couple of tracks, the mid-tempo \\"Love Is All\\", and \\"My Promise\\" (1st single), where the brass section gets a nice work-out. After that the album struggles to maintain the very high bar set by these 3 songs. \\"Guiding Lights\\" is at 6 1/2 min. by far the longest track on here, and could've been trimmed by a few minutes. After a short instrumental (\\"Belo Horizonte\\"), the band brings \\"Dance Floor\\", and as the title suggests, it is meant to get you moving, and that it does, and it's the last true highlight of the album, although the album closer \\"The Rush\\" is quite nice too. In all, this album is a welcome return from \\"the mightly elements of the universe\\".<br /><br />EW&F played a fantastic show before a sell-out crowd here in Cincinnati this past weekend. As a long-time fan going back to \\"That's The Way of the World\\", it was a delight to see the three remaining original EW&F members of Philip Bailey, Verdine White, and Ralph Johnson, assisted by a very capable band (which includes Philip's son, Philip Doron Bailey), bring all the classic hits. They also played 4 songs from the new album (My Promise, Love Is Law, Sign On, and Dance Floor), which blended in perfectly well with the older tunes. If you have a chance to see EW&F in concert, do not miss them! A good time is guaranteed for all.
B009NFHF0Q|5.0|Written from a child's perspective, this coming of age tale requires the perspective of an adult to truly appreciate it's magic. Neil Gaiman has once again proven that he is a master story teller.
B00DBSZJRM|4.0|With a title like that-one should not expect great drama.  What I expected was what I got-a fun romp in the absurd.  Hansel and Gretel were over the top fun to watch in action.  The weapons were  awesome and oddly enough one can find equally inventive weapons way back in history.  As for it not being fit for children-read the actual story of Hansel and Gretel along with the other stories of the time-all were pretty gory and dark just like life was in the same time frame.  The witches were all pretty amazing in appearance-excellent make up jobs on them.  If you are looking for a serious movie-skip this one.  If not, give it a try-a decent grab a bowl of popcorn movie for a weekend afternoon.
B00DR0PDNE|4.0|I had heard and read great things about the Chromecast, so I went in with high expectations.  I ordered it during the extended backorder period, and waited for over a month to get my Chromecast.  Amazon was upfront when I bought it, saying it could be up to 2-3 months before I would receive it.  Happily I received an e-mail from Amazon stating they received the Chromecast early and I received it after 4.5 weeks.<br /><br />The product packaging is very nice - reminiscent of iPad/iPhone packaging.  Inside is the Chromecast, small rudimentary instruction booklet, USB power cable, and a power adapter if a USB slot is not available.<br /><br />The Chromecast uses HDMI to connect to your TV.  It doesn't receive power over the HDMI, so the USB adapter cable goes into the other end of the Chromecast and then into a USB port on your TV.  Plug both in and then install the app on your devices.  Once you've plugged it in, change your TV to display that HDMI input.  You will also need a wireless network to connect to.<br /><br />Setup is very easy.  You'll spend the majority of your time just downloading the Chromecast app to your device, whether it be an Android or Apple product.  I installed the app on both a Samsung Galaxy IIIS and an iPad 2 (running iOS 7).  I also installed the Android and Apple Google Chrome app in each respective device.  Once the Chromecast app is installed, you open the app and it will automatically recognize the Chromecast.  You will enter your password for your wireless network and it will connect in a few seconds.  You can then change the name of the Chromecast, and you're off to the races.<br /><br />From your Android or Apple device, you can stream video and audio from Netflix, YouTube, Chrome, and Google Play.  When you are in those apps, there will be a new icon in the upper right hand corner that will connect your feed to the Chromecast.  The transition of the video to the Chromecast is extremely fast, and YouTube videos look fantastic (assuming they're good quality videos in the first place).  You can pause, play, and fast forward from your Android or Apple device, and responsiveness is very quick.  Netflix is fantastic to use with the Chromecast as well.<br /><br />So, if I like it that much, why deduct a star?  Only because I wish it connected directly with more apps right now (I'm looking at you,  Amazon Prime).  I have not tried to stream Amazon Prime to the Chromecast through the Google Chrome browser, but that will be next.  Once I've done so, I'll post the results.<br /><br />Overall - this is the cat's meow.
B009NFHF0Q|5.0|Honestly I had no idea what this book was about and was pleasantly surprised by the story. I could not put this book down, and when I did all I did was think about it!!
B000XUBFE2|5.0|I loved this book. I think the manner of writing is so clever. I felt the words and pictures were painted in my mind. Relationships became dear and the war and or predjudice made me ill. I am glad that I happened upon this wonderfully written treasure!
B003U6BE8I|5.0|This was an incredible movie to watch. The special effects are amazing!  I can't wait to see the next one!
B0064MPXFA|5.0|Everything about this series is of the highest quality: the acting, stories, direction, and its look. Add to that is is such a timely topic it really is tough to resist!
B0020BUWX2|5.0|Well-written and thought provoking, this book is a great example of realistic fiction. It took me a while to truly get into If I Stay, but I am so glad I stayed with it (pun intended).
B008MAI0WK|5.0|I am considering buying a Raspberry PI, but wanted to know something about it before buying.  This book  is EXCELLENT!!!!!  It is clear, concise, easy to understand and has convinced me to go ahead and buy the Ras Pi.  Highly Recommended.
B000SEGTI0|3.0|Well I have watched Blade Runner so many times my hair turned blonde(Normally red); however, I had not read the book until many months ago and I assumed-without any real thought-that the book and movie were the same, I was wrong.  When I finally bought the book-with hopes high-I realized the book nearly bored me into an unmarked grave.  It has great writing techniques-interesting characters in all fairness-but it takes too long to develop them.  Nothing happens, except for boring scenes and far too many insights(Best sipped in moderation).<br />  All and all, the movie was brilliant; however, huge important liberties were taken-thank god-because it would have sucked if Ridley Scott hadn't seen a way thru.  There were so many angles in BladeRunner, and rightfully it has enormous appeal to all Sci-Fi fans.  Visually stunning, breathtaking insights, but neverless not boring at all.  It satisfies the Roman Sci-Fi tragedy to the infinite end.<br />  I think Philip K. Dick gets more credit due to how great the movie is; with the casual fan wanting to think it all came out of his book; but they are trundling down the wrong road.  I admit, I felt the same way; but I didn't continue to think that after I read the book.  The Philip K. Dick diehards are partially right; this story would never have existed without Philip's incredible vision.  Some fans tragically will never accept the fact that the movie was largely the reason they became fans- even thou it certainly was the case.  Only buy this one if it's freshman year in college; it will give you great ideas to ponder if you do.  Certainly worth a once thru, but you need to see what Ridley Scott did with it to see how far he took it.  [[ASIN:B0012PDVQ2 Blade Runner: The Final Cut]]
B009XIXVU6|5.0|I thoroughly enjoyed and the mountains echoed. It is well written and provides a personal view of the hardships endured by the Afghan people.<br /><br />an.echoed
B0000DZTIL|2.0|This movie has a bit of inherited charm as the lowest-budget, least successful of the mid-1980s \\"wacky teenage science\\" movies. However, it's poorly cast (the \\"teenagers\\" mostly look to be in their mid-to-late-20s), paced slowly, not very funny, and the special effects were mediocre even by the standards of the time it was released.
B007J4T2G8|5.0|This book has me staying up late and flipping pages almost faster than I could read them. There was an unexpected twist that got me hooked. Definitely not what I expected but such a good outcome !
B008UCJ7KO|5.0|The book reminds me a lot of Fifty Shades; but it seems a bit more realistic.  Not realistic in the sense of monetary (very few people have the type of money they both reference), but realistic in the sense of relationship behavior.  Unlike others who felt cheated about Sylvia continuing this saga, I am looking forward to the next book.
B00BMNM4H6|5.0|I can't stop playing this game.  This simple game has it all.  You have to use creative engineering to pass each level.  One of the best game on Amazon.
B00D014E4Y|5.0|This was a very fun movie and although it is for kids....I enjoyed it every bit as much as they would. Loved the grumbling comments by Batman with regard to Superman. Loved watching the characters walking. Can't wait for the next Lego movie.
B00EY8BRGU|1.0|Laughably bad, I swear they must have done one take of every scene and edited it together while completely stoned. Magic scenes make no sense and overly rely on editing and special effects. I cant believe so many good actors were in such a terrible film.
B00EY8A6BC|4.0|They put together a great cast and combined it with a pretty cool story.  It's not going to win any Oscars, but it's an entertaining choice for a movie night at home.
1446301583|5.0|I am always concerned ordering a used book.  Was pleasantly surprised and pleased.  Book is like brand new!  Will order again
B006RXPUR2|5.0|Thought it was amazing!  Love the story and the acting and the suspense, would recommend it to most movie watchers!
B000FBFN1U|5.0|Ive no doubt that this series will become legendary in the world of literature and the world at large. Much like how we today cherish the work of authors like Tolkein (The Hobbit , lord of the rings), this series will be studied and debated in the ivory towers of academia, loved by the public, and withstand the future cultural swings and fads to transcend into a timeless masterpiece. You are lucky to be a part this of history.
B009ZQC7MY|5.0|With many unpredictable twists of its plot, Downton Abbey has been an interesting glimpse into English life after WWI. The characters all have their flaws, and that makes it more interesting to return to each week. I think each season gets better at drawing us into their drama.  We started with season one this year, and the first episode did not draw my husband into the storyline.  However, once he saw the second one, he was hooked.  This is one we watch together.
B00005ASOC|5.0|I love this movie and have watched it counless times. Sean Connery is great as always. Rob Brown as a teen with Buster Rhymes as his brother!!
B00915G6WQ|2.0|Just saw the last episode and watched final season... I gotta say Season 8 must be the WORST of them all. I'm not sure if the writers quit, or they just wanted to get this show over with, but the creativity was just not there. Highly disappointed with the final season, so much that I probably won't even purchase that one. I'll just stop it at Season 7
B0089EHWQE|5.0|COULD NOT PUT IT DOWN ONCE I STARTED IT.......GOT SO ENGROSSED THAT I STAYED UP MANY A NIGHT JUST TO FINISH IT...
B00DR0PDNE|3.0|The device looks pretty snazzy, until you realize that it needs a power source - a fact that is carefully omitted in the marketing.  I have a USB input right next to the HDMI port, so it's not a big deal, but if you don't you'll need to plug it in like any standard appliance.<br /><br />Second, the apps are very limited.  Google needs to quickly expand to Picasa and other apps to make this a more interesting product.<br /><br />On the positive side, it is fairly plug and play, and is pretty cool for the apps that do work (YouTube, Chrome).
B00AZMFK3K|4.0|It was pretty good, I liked the first one while the story isnt as good as the first one still a lot more entertaining than the original series of movies.
B009EEFTMC|5.0|I love the graphics on this game.  The colors and the ability to rotate the cube in 3 dimensions is great.  Lots of fun to play in those odd moments when you need to occupy yourself but do not want to get too involved in something complex.
0307744434|5.0|Received within a reasonable amount of time, and in excellent quality. no bending or frays on the cover. will be reading it soon for myself.
B004ZH66XO|3.0|This is a fun little game, quite addictive until you get to the last level of adventure which crashes the app every time on both difficulties.<br />As to the other reviews I haven't seen any adds or IAP, I was only able to buy items with in game coins and there were plenty to collect whilst playing so I guess they changed it for faotd.
B0008237BO|4.0|i like different pac albums for different reasons.  this ones dope because he's got some classic thug stuff plus a few more introspective songs.  all these years later i find myself just getting into some of the tracks on here.  you probably have heard &#34;hail mary&#34;, &#34;toss it up&#34; and &#34;to live and die in LA&#34;....  those are all bangers but there are some other nice joints as well.  i do agree he kinda wasted the against all odds beat going in on mobb deep and others.  with a hook talking about the truest ish he ever wrote, i wish he'd have picked a different topic... that song could have been so much better
B00D6SBOWG|5.0|I  LOVE THIS GAME  Hours of fun for everyone I recommend  it for anyone who likes solitary Graphics are great and I love Gopher
B00B5P37IG|1.0|I thought this was going to give me access to live tv via it's name Live TV. It is a bunch of religious channels and strange movies. There isn't much to watch that is not from another country. I can see enjoying this if you are not in this country but for someone here it just doesn't work. I will be removing this from my kindle fire.

B000002WPI|5.0|still very good.  if you have this album, there's nothing i'll say here that you don't already know.  if you don't have this album, stop reading reviews right now and click &#34;add to cart&#34;.  you wont regret it
B00DR0PDNE|5.0|This has turned into a hand little electronic gadget. It's simple to install and use. I was dreading setting this up but into turned into a breeze. easy to understand directions even for this person who is not a technical guru at all. Just a few minutes after I had it out of the box i was able to use it. The only drawback is that only a very few apps are able to use this. Netflix,YouTube and Google play at this time. But for $35 it's really a good investment for hopefully more in the future.
B00EY8BRGU|5.0|I watch a ton of movies. This one was a great ride. I never saw it coming and you won't either and that's why this was a blast. The question for you is....<br />who is keyser soze?
B00EQRMAJW|5.0|This cd is fantastic! I love that he hasn't strayed away from his RnB/Soul roots like so many other artist. This cd is truly great and worth your money and time.
B00915G6MG|5.0|NCIS season 10 has arrived and devoured. It seems there is never a dull moment with the NCIS team, each episode keeps you on the edge of your seat.  Highly recommended...
B00CWGLOY6|5.0|Read above. Yell it out and drag the middle \\"a\\".<br /><br />That's what it was like reading Saga. It was recommended by a friend. That friend is now really cool.<br /><br />Thanks friend.
B008GXHOFW|5.0|Graphics aren't so great but the game play is the best!!!!!!! I love that you can upgrade things so you don't have them all and play to not feel you earned anything.the black suit is the only way I could defeat the lizard there fore I had to earn it he was hard to defeat even with the black suit .the challenges were hard two but it is a great game.
B00F91RYL8|4.0|Most zombie movies are just a bunch of Zombies feeding on non-zombies. This movie actually had a different take. There was an actual plot. The zombies are acting as hosts to spread the virus and not just blindly chomping on humans for some unknown reason.  The plot is somewhat plausible where in this scenario the lead actor (Brad Pit) is less stupid than the Scientists who forget that observation is part of science. I liked this movie.
0131988425|5.0|Had to buy this book for college. Good book for a good price especially when you are in need of cheap books.
B000MV90F8|5.0|Excellent acting, story and quality of DVD. Current day Vatican can take the lead from the present Pope and  the courage and integrity of priests like Fr.O Flaherty.
B002TVQ4HG|5.0|Great cast! Melissa George and Liam Hemsworth are phenomenal. This movie keeps you guessing the whole time. If you like this, I highly recommend the movie Timecrimes.
B0040I09RM|5.0|Absolutely addicting-the show makes me want to see more. I just can't stop watching and cannot anticipate what will happen next z
B000SEGEKI|5.0|The book describes many of the best practices of software engineering, practices it may take you too long to come across and adopt. It's also an easy and fun read.
B009NPA3MS|5.0|Phillip Phillips is a diamond in the rough in the ruin that has become American Idol. He's got an incredible talent and a humble attitude that draws fans like flies to honey. His tone is rich and the content of his lyrics are relatable. I saw him recently on tour and he's as wonderful live as he is on this CD. There are few CDs out there that I can listen to the whole way through and love every song, and this is one of those albums. I would recommend &#34;Phil Phil&#34; to anyone and everyone.

B007XKEY6Q|2.0|This app would be great fun if it worked 1/2 the time.  I keep getting errors on it - One says &#34;I see you are playing on multiple devices&#34; and then kicks what I just drew into the trash, making me draw all over. Sometime losing pricey &#34;bombs&#34;.  I do NOT play on any other devices than my iPhone, so don't have a clue what is up with that.  Also, its says &#34;Free up some space on your device so we can keep playing&#34; and again, kicks me off.  My iPhone has 32 gigs!!! I know for a fact I have plenty of space.  Last week, I was trying to draw something and all it would do was give me little specks of color where my fingers touched the screen.  It was supposed to be a tractor! UGH!.  I would really like to play this game, but until all the bugs are fixed, I just uninstalled it. Boo.
B00F56AZK4|5.0|I've always loved jigsaw puzzles. This app is a great way to play on the go or when you just don't have the room to lay out a real puzzle. I can see myself eventually buying the in-app purchases, as well. This is a great app for all ages to enjoy! Love it.
B00E8KLWB4|3.0|This game is difficult to play on a iPhone and the rules for advancement are obscure. Graphics are great and puzzles are doable. Would be better on PC or tablet.
1608199096|5.0|I bought this book for my husband, who collects cookbooks, specifically for the beautiful binding.  The images are lovely, the binding is beautiful, and I haven't even looked at the recipes.  Two thumbs up from my husband.
B009LH1Y1W|5.0|Became a fan of the show half way through the 1st season! Working through season 8 and can't wait for 9!
B0091REZMW|3.0|I would give it 5 stars if I didn't have to start levels over when my daughter uninstalls it. Not sure why that happens when I retain friends, wall messages and gifts.
1781162646|5.0|Not a typical King story, but King nonetheless.  A little slow to start, but once it got going, it was very captivating. I love all things Stephen King and am not going to give a bad review based on a slow start or an atypical story.  Its not his usual weirdness, but it is sprinkled with a little strange. Not the best of his I have read, but I liked it fairly well.
B007ZXK08C|3.0|I found this book at a bit tedious & I flicked through some pages. However the plot was very clever & I found that I needed to read to the end to uncover the truth.
6305622914|5.0|This movie touches every emotion.  It is funny.  Is is sad.  It is hopeful.  The characters are developed so well you feel all of their emotions. It was relatively unhearlded when released, but it remains one of my all time favorites.

B009G7ZYPY|5.0|This is the third album of hers that we have acquired and we have enjoyed them all very much.  Simon even likes her.
B007HO392S|5.0|I recommend this album. I love all songs. &#34;Two black Cadillacs&#34;, &#34;Blown away&#34;, &#34;See you again&#34; and &#34;Who you are&#34; are the best.
B004J4WLB4|5.0|I found the story compelling and interesting with the references to flowers.  I found it hard to believe she could leave her baby to cry for so long.  I know she didn't trust anyone, not even herself, but I would have thought she would find someone who had helped her to help her again.  Many were willing.
B008Y7N7JW|5.0|Very good movie. It's a kill or be killed with love winning in the end. Can't wait to see the second one.
B0084670FU|5.0|Don't you love movies where you can't figure out where it's going to go, but it keeps you on the edge of the seat? Babel hits you like that and blows your mind away. Remember the movie &#34;Crash&#34;? Well, if you totally love that movie, then you should check this out too. I loved how the story was written and really felt the pain that Brad Pitt's character was going through. Cate Blanchett played his wife and she delivered a wonderful performance as well. Like I said, check it out!
B00DYFCYSO|4.0|My husband asked for this CD before it was even available, I was able to reserve it through Amazon.com.<br />One of my husband favorite songs is &#34;Who Do We think We are&#34; which is on this CD.<br />Good price from Amazon.com
0575089911|5.0|It had a suprise ending.  It took a little bit to get into the characters of the book, but once you did you couldn't put it down.  The heroine of the book is a normal everyday feeling person whom you can relate to.  I would compare this work to Terry Brooks and Robert Jordan.
B00BXZ3D6Y|5.0|,i enjoy using this app everyday its exactly what i was looking for, and my kids also love to record themselves just for fun!
B00E8KLWB4|5.0|Awesome game. Reminds me of Mystery Manor but better, good job!!!! The graphics are good and lots of attention to detail
B009KS4XRO|4.0|This is the best bingo app by far that I've found for my kindle fire. It's addictive for sure, with a lot more than just bingo..the slots are fun, and I love the different themed rooms. There are occasionally glitches, and they are pretty cheap with the bingo credits, which is a total bummer, but of course you can always buy more with real money! But overall, it's fun, and the best app out of all the others I've tried.
1932073221|5.0|Really cant recommend highly enough.  Thought provoking book that really helps in self reflection and actualizing wealth and in happiness.
1439153663|3.0|Although I thought the book was well-written, it was too heavy-handed with the abuse and melodrama aspects. The characters were interesting, but their overall arc (other than the antagonist) was disappointing.
B002ZG99TA|4.0|A funny movie, but serious at the same time.  I liked it.  It does keep you on the edge of your seat.
B000NY17J6|5.0|Such a GREAT CD / purchase!! The only thing I've been listening to for the last 2 weeks straight. Excellent Job, Linda!!!
0061122416|5.0|Although I generally do not enjoy fiction, there are a few exceptions, and this book is one of them. Actually, this is one of my all-time favorite, fictional books and judging from reactions around the world, with millions and millions of copies sold, I am not alone in feeling this way.<br /><br />The Alchemist is a fable about a young shepherd who travels the Mediterranean in search of a treasure. The plot itself is gripping, but veiled in the adventure are profound truths that are definite cause for pause in our hectic lives. Coehlo does an amazing job of teaching us \\"the essential wisdom of listening to our hearts, learning to read omens strewn along life's path, and, above all, following our dreams.\\" Warning, once you start this book, you won't want to put it down.
B00CCX9DUG|5.0|A wonderfully engrossing story. The version of events told here although fictional, is possible and written in such a way as to be vey believable.<br />I really could not it this book down and was sorry to finish it.
B000FA5SMK|5.0|This book was a good thriller, first time reading John Corey.  I love mystery books and this one was a winner.  I stayed up late two nights finishing it.  I would have finished it off in just one night but we were babysitting our grand child and I knew the next morning would be an early one with a four year old.
B0015AARJI|4.0|It is what I bought and it works like what it is. It came good. This guy sells stuff good.

B009IEXKXI|5.0|This was an engaging story, highly recommend. How he faces the challenges Mars throws at him, over and over was fascinating. I enjoyed the mix of science and action while getting to know, and like, the main character.
1455113549|1.0|This is the second set that I have purchased. My CD player has no difficulty playing other recorded books but once again I will have to return this one
B004DI7HZ6|5.0|What a great book.  The characters are wonderful and I can't wait to read the next one and the next.one.
B0035Q4AFC|5.0|I happened upon this movie when I was just browsing but I am so happy that I decided to watch it!  Fine performances by everyone and enjoyable to watch as well as a &#34;in-depth&#34; look into the beginnings of the Hollywood film industry.  Charlie Chaplin was truly one of the BEST performers of his time and obviously he was a creative genius.  I plan to watch again soon.
B007SZ0E1K|5.0|I've been using hand-me-down AMD cpus for a long time as I haven't had money for my own expensive Intel CPU. I must say it's worth spending the money to get this kind of performance. The reliability seems to be better as well but this is a new CPU vs a used one, so that may have something to do with it. I've overclocked this thing to 4.2Ghz, running it at 1.3V and good temps with my Hyper 212 EVO.<br /><br />I am happy with the purchase, even if it seems like the cost is a huge profit for Intel.
B00003CXAT|5.0|What a movie. It is full of chills and thrills and prehistoric monsters with attitudes. I always enjoy watching it ever time I pop it into my DVD player. It is a must have movie. Well acted, well directed. What more can I say?
B005VSRFEA|3.0|The first 25% of the book is very good, then the book trails off into communism like thinking and a dose of skepticism.  I recommend this book only for the part of systems theory, and keep in mind that when she is talking about politics and environmentalism that she comes from an erred philosophical base and you have to recognize that as she uses system theory to support communist or environmental ideas.  Her basic error is to view the &#34;good of the whole&#34;, but the error is that there is no good of the whole - just good of an individual (because good applies to living entities and a sum of individuals do not create a new entity).  This is the communist belief of a higher organism in which individuals must sacrifice to.  I prefer the examples using bathtub water flow and thermostats and so on and there are enough of them to learn from this book.
159562015X|4.0|I had my unit of 20 members take this recently and, for the price, was an excellent tool to promote discussion and visibility across the group.  You get what you put into it, and would benefit by a non partial individual administer the results (HR oriented).  Interesting that the tenants in this assessment apply to both your personal and professional aspects.
B00E8KLWB4|5.0|This game is good. Starts off real slow,but it is fun to play. If you are looking for a time waster, this is it. Quite fun
B00BMKH5NW|5.0|Upon finding this story, I had high expectations. Every one that I had was filled entirely. The beginning was a bit slow, but the ending makes up for everything. I was giggling like a child at Levi and couldn't have been more relieved with the accuracy of being a fangirl (I know this from experience). I couldn't put this book down and will cherish this book for the longest time.
B008XG1X18|5.0|I work as a cook in a nursing home unit of 16 residents and PINTREST has become a valuable tool for me in ideas for items to make for my residents.  This is the only tool I use.  Personally , it is a great source of info to me from every topic from cleaning tips, to crafts, to health info.  Thank you to the developers for placing the world at my fingertips!
B00E0OK2X2|5.0|This is a surprisingly good app. The basic premise is that you drag two fingers to two sides of the screen, which forms a line, and match the line up with circles on the screen. This app is surprisingly addictive, due to the amazing soundtrack. As you play, the game plays music for each new level. This music is very rhythmic and electronic, and works very well with the rest of the game. This app is developed by Double Fine, an independent game studio known for the action platformer Psychonauts, as well as the strategy action game Br&uuml;tal legend. When I first heard of this game, I was skeptical due to the nature of the nature of the gameplay. After playing it though, I can easily recommend it due to the addicting gameplay and awesome soundtrack. My only complaint is the poor tutorial, as it will take a few tries to fully understand it. Overall though, five out of five.
B0069G5Z9K|5.0|My little sis loves play in on it I also love to play on it. It's is a very fun and challenging game!

B005RYF5JA|5.0|I love listening to this group and can not wait to see more DVDs from Celtic Women in the near future.
B0050DIWFC|5.0|A must read. Couldn't put it down. Suspenseful and leaves you to draw your own conclusions as a true trial would.
B0067Q42BY|5.0|I think it's hard sometimes to easily pick up a new game. This one was the best ever. It &#34;teaches&#34; you how it works on a few test games and then you're turned loose.  I was defeating it in no time.
B0061PEAUY|4.0|Very good story. Kept me guessing untill the very end of the story. Kathy Reichs is a very good story teller.
B00CJGP116|3.0|It wasn't what I expected.  Didn't care for some of the songs and the music arrangements.  I guess I was expecting  more like Spanish singer Luis Miguel.
1416972250|5.0|I love this series!! I can't wait to get the next book i was addicted after the first few chapters!!
B00BHAT2XI|5.0|This show should be a genre of it's own.<br />The game of thrones has what every good television show should have, a very well written plot, well performed characters, and no expenses spared in creating the perfect and thrilling visual effect.<br /><br />But what makes the game of thrones so distinctive from other boring and repetitive and predictable power play television shows, is none of the characters are stupid, they each posses their own individual intellects and even pitfalls. It is exciting to see which character would end up surviving the entire ordeal.<br /><br />The game of thrones (yes, in spite it's nude scenes which may offend some people), is worth seeing.
B00C5R8364|5.0|Well researched, believable, current and interesting stories.<br /><br />I can't wait until he does another one!<br /><br />Best of the genre in my view.
B008XX6J4C|5.0|Having seen them perform on video I would say that to watch them perform is as much fun as listening.  I love their videos.
B008RA3X5E|5.0|It works really well! I especially like that I can set my personal music for my alarm and everything also seeing the weather as well is nice in the mornings. Overall just a really nice app.
6305128952|5.0|Great story on how issues can be over come with the animals we love, it takes patience and trust and a lot of TLC. Good story on the relationships of Man & horse.
1416972242|5.0|I love this series!! Can't wait to get the next book! ! Its hard to put the book down!! !!
B003G4W49C|5.0|I enjoyed the read thoroughly. The author has the ability to conjure up emotions myself that I hadn't yet imagined. Real sadness, joy, pain, anger, confusion, numbness, accompanied me throughout the story, and I cannot wait to read the next.<br />Intricately created characters, and the most beautiful of all, Ender Wiggin, were the reason this was such a wonderful book. Deeply philosophical meanings are sprinkled on the pages of this book. I suggest it as a read for any age.
B003TSEEDY|4.0|Dear Friend,<br /><br />I literally just finished reading this book, and felt compelled to write a review. Not because I'm some sort of intellectual who just loves to hear myself and show people how smart I am, or how well (or not well) I write. I am not even attempting to persuade anyone to purchase this book. I am writing this because I feel inspired. Mainly I feel inspired because at times I feel that the central character and I share many of the same attributes. Mainly the ability to watch and absorb, but not actively participate. Like Charlie, I am participating by writing this review because believe it or not, something as small as writing a simple review on Amazon can make a \\"wallflower\\" feel like a participant and not just a quiet observer. This is something I have taken from this book. This is not so much me explaining my inner battle, not like being a compulsive liar, or a maniac depressive or something that can actually be considered a battle from within that can have life changing results. Simply, this is a characteristic that I am aware of that I would like to change to a certain extent \\"because it's okay to feel things. And be who we are about them\\", and expressing oneself is the best way to feel things, even in the smallest ways.<br /><br />Kurt Vonnegut once said \\"to practice any art, no matter how well or badly is a way to make your soul grow\\". I have never written a review, the last time Ive done anything similar to this was probably a million years ago when I had to do my last book report ever. Bare with me, I'm sure my thoughts and opinions will become a jumbled up mess at some point. But I must remind myself that this is NOT about perfection. So here goes nothing...........<br /><br />\\"The Perks of Being a Wallflower\\" is a story of a young man named \\"Charlie\\", he makes it known he rather be anonymous to his audience so throughout the book he uses this particular fake name for his anonymity reasons. His audience is a person he has never actuallymeet, but knows through other people and feels comfortable enough to write letters to (you get the feeling very quickly that Charlie does not have many outlets for his feelings, so anything seems acceptable and helpful). These letters contain his days, his thought, his opinions, and mainly his raw feelings. Charlie is pleasant boy with a gentle presence and a sensitive soul. He is a bit odd in his feelings and has some troubles, troubles that throughout the book are a bit hard to pin point. You soon learn that he has lost two very important people in his life and figure that he has had a really hard time dealing with these losses. He is a lonely young man getting ready to start his freshman year of high school. He loves his family but has a disconnect from them mainly because of his quiet nature and sensitivity, which no one understands, but his mother is the most patient with him. He doesn't have  many friends and would be considered a loner until Sam and Patrick come along. With them comes a light that is shone into charlies gloomy world that gives him a new found hope and happiness. He feels less alone now that he has found two people who have genuinely taken an interest in him. Sam and Patrick are older, but when getting to know Charlie while reading this book you start to see that him being friends with older people is actually better for Charlie, as opposed to being friends with kids his own age. Because of Charlies over-sensitivity I believe it could've only been tolerated by people with a certain amount of maturity. They see Charlie as not just a sweet kid, but a person with a lot to contribute; whether he believes this quality about himself or not. Sam and Patrick are both very interesting people, both seniors and consider themselves to be very cultured and individualistic. Charlie takes notice of this and gravitates towards them and there circle of friends very quickly because they are so interesting, fun, honest, and forgiving.<br /><br />Throughout thisbook through the letters Charlie sends his anonymous reader, you feel Charlies love for everyone in his life including his siblings, parents, his teacher who takes a special interest in Charlie, his deceased aunt, and mostly his friends Sam and Patrick. Through the book you feel Charlies highs and his lows, but you also feel the dark cloud that seems to never be too far from Charlie. This sadness and guilt haunts Charlie regularly and just when it seems his has shaken it, it appears over his head gloomier and sadder than ever. You come to love Charlie very quickly when reading this book, he reminds us what it meant to be a timid teenager with a vulnerability and sensitivity that at times is indescribable. You also see how fiercely loyal Charlie is. When the tables turn and his friends start having hard times, Charlies love and devotion to his friends never changes, even when they \\"turn\\" on him, it never changes. Through his experiences you become invested in Charlie because there is a longing that you hope he gets better, with a mixer of wanting to protect him from the harshness of the world. When the book nears the end there are some revelations that are like a light switch coming on in a scarily dark room. The pieces that were missing from the puzzle are found, and with comes a maturity and acceptance that Charlie did not poses during the beginning of the book.<br /><br />Of course I highly recommend this book to anyone interested in reading a book that is beautifully simplistic. But I mainly recommend this book to anyone who is or once was a wallflower. I recommend this book to the sensitive souls that drift around in the cruel and hard world. I recommend this book to anyone who rather take a hug than throw a punch. I recommend this book to the high schooler feeling lost and alone. I recommend this book to anyone who loved the 90's as much as I did!!!! I also recommend reading this book with \\"The Smiths\\" music on repeat.<br /><br />Thanks for taking the time to read. Hopefully my reviews will get better as time goes on. Cheers!<br /><br />Teresa

B002MQYOFW|4.0|A fascinating story of what we will become if we turn our back on God. Because without the driving force of our God-given conscience we become barbaric and find ourselves capable of the unthinkable --  pitting child against child for our \\"entertainment\\".  Not only do we become like Rome in it's final days we find it an acceptable reality. The Hunger Games is powerfully told tale meant to challenge us to be better than we are. I'm

B00BEEC6L2|4.0|I recently purchased the Kindle version of Judge Dredd The Complete Case Files 01 instead of the paper version because it was slightly cheaper and there's the instant gratification of not having to wait for shipping. The comics are fantastic, other reviews will tell you more about the content, but the Kindle version was really poorly done. It is very hard to read because of the small size/low-resolution of each digitalized page, the panel-by-panel view is clunky (and still leaves the comics in a nearly unreadable format) at best, and Amazon does not permit the file to be viewed on their computer-based reader so there's no way to zoom-in far enough to read it without straining your eyes.  I think I'm going to ask for a refund and use that to get the paper version instead.

B002MCYWHG|1.0|If I could rate the concept of this item, I would give it 5 stars. What you should know about this. It is a seat on a support bar. The support bar goes from just under the handlebars to under the seat. So basically, it turned my women's bike into a man's bike. With it on, I had a hard time getting my leg over the side and pretty much made it impossible to stop my bike. I had to use my tiptoes to stand up my bike. Also. The seat is a little close to me. After a while it made it uncomfortable because I had to pedal with my legs turned slightly out. Not crazy about this product. Had to return it.

B00F35BV64|5.0|I love Star Trek (well, the original series, ST:TNG, or &#34;Star Trek: The Next Generation.&#34;  Deep Space Nine was OK, but I felt they went off the rails a bit with Voyager. I'm one of the few who actually liked &#34;Enterprise,&#34; but even though I actually worked in the Gene Roddenberry Building when I was employed by Paramount Television (one of the BEST jobs I ever had), I do not really consider myself a Trekkor (or  Trekkie. Dang! I can never get that straight).<br /><br />So this second installment of the 'JJ Abrahms Reboot' of the original series features the alternative universe timeline of that lovable crew: Kirk, Spock, Bones, and the rest..He sticks to the general current of the original series river, so the second film tracks with the original series BEST (imho) film, &#34;Star Trek: The Wrath of Khan&#34; featuring Ricardo Montalban as Khan (and he was OUTSTANDING as the evil Khan).  Somehow, JJ does the impossible and after seeing Benedict Cumberbatch's 'Sherlock Holmes' (a bravura performance in itself), cast him as this generation's evil Khan, which helped make this the best film in the series. From the warp core technology shot at CERN's Large Hadron Collider, to the volcano suit, bridge, and other tech, the film delivers impeccable production design.  The performances are all first rate; from Khan's deviousness to Spock's humanity; from Kirk's humility to Scotty's comedy; I really love this cast!<br /><br />The film is outstanding entertainment, with a mature dramatic locus while keeping that tension-breaking light-heartedness where required, this trek will be a part of my ever-expanding collection of sci-fi.  May the final frontier be with you,
B00DR0PDNE|4.0|Simple and easy to use. Nice product with no bells and whistles. Can't beat it for the price. Size is great..
B0053TMP24|5.0|I've always loved Rick Riodan's writing but I was honestly a little discouraged when there was no Annabeth. I was like why should I read this but after I got into it I was amazed. Just the fact that Gaea and the rest of the giants were raised I knew it was  to be a good book. I hope you love this book.
0312932081|5.0|One of the two best science fiction books I have ever read (I am 65) - the other being Stranger in a Strange Land,  this book is exciting from beginning to end and the ending blew me away.  What a shock - I had completely missed where this was heading.  Read it - you'll love it.
B0060MYM3S|5.0|Really enjoyed the movie.<br />All of the characters made it believable and entertaining, it is almost as good as the books..<br />Worth buying and watching again.
B00BCZU8WM|5.0|Its justin Timberlake why would I have any problems.  Took a while to get it but for the price all went well.
B006RXQ800|5.0|This is one of my all time favorite movies. Leonardo DiCaprio is a great actor but Daniel Day-Lewis steals every scene he's in like always. Cameron Diaz is awesome as well.
B00E5Q1LTY|5.0|I enjoyed the spin off of the classic wrath of Kahn. I am a treky fan but i enjoyed most of the movie. I could go without the love story with spok but it gives him a more human side that is different from the old spok. I would recommend this movie to anyone.
B009GIPDQS|5.0|In true Grisham style a great story. Terrific premise, believable characters. & all round page turner. Also look forward to a new John Grisham book
B00AFEY354|4.0|Really enjoyed the movie.<br />Both Emma Watson and the secondary characters made it believable and entertaining.<br />Worth buying and watching again.
B002XISFGS|4.0|I find this a perfect reproduction of the original motion picture. It is still one of the best ST movies :p
B008Q09K2U|3.0|I fell in love with Nelson DeMille ever since I read the first book from him, but during the time, I have realized that he is losing his sharpness and storytelling ability. The latest one from John Corey series is very average novel, which I wouldn't probably even consider of reading if I haven't read all the other novels from the series. If you are planning to start with DeMille with this book - don't! Take a look at Plum Island or General's Daugther or Gold Coast. All of them are much better than this one.
B004V9MU86|5.0|From the opening paragraphs, I just loved this book.  The descriptive prose is just beautiful, the narration (I thought of this character as the Angel of Death) was captivating, and the story so thought provoking as it presents a different angle on the lives of many good german people during the Hitler years.  I also found myself not relegating this story to history, but wondering about comparisons with current political situations and displaced people.  A great book for me is one that stays with me after I finish it, and this one certainly did.
B000P0J09C|5.0|This is an all around great movie.  While it is anti war and was made after the Vietnam conflict it makes excellent points as to the possible very real deterioration of the psyche of some people during Marine boot camp and the characterizing of some of the different and somewhat extreme personality types that were part of every company in every part of the military then and now.

B000VZYPB4|5.0|The casting is perfect!  The writers are brilliant.  Every episode is great!  Wish we had more TV like this.  Thanks!
B000OZ0NXA|3.0|I was really getting bored with this character and the patented way every story was written.  As he hobos around the USA he runs into similar situations in different parts of the country, always involved with law enforcement and always with a &#34;handy&#34; love interest.  Same result as the last book, the girls always fall in love with him and he always decides that he just doesn't want to be tied to just on location for the rest of his lift so it's on to the next location and the next book.

B00127RAJY|5.0|This program does as it states if you follow it completely and eat as needed for caloric reduction. It gives you the sweat and burn that will get the body in shape. As with any exercise program, always consult a physician and use common sense about what your body tells you. Would definitely recommend as part of a exercise regimen to get and stay in shape.
B004Q7DQLS|5.0|I was spellbound by Dragon Bound! Several months ago, I read the first chapter at the end of another book, and was intrigued, but didn't buy it right away. After, I couldn't remember the author or title, yet the premise stayed with me. Yesterday, while reading yet another paranormal that just wasn't doing it for me, I asked for help on a Goodreads thread. Someone immediately came back with the title and I couldn't be happier!<br />I thought Ms Harrison did a wonderful job building her worlds and the beings that inhabit them. Pia was a strong, feisty heroine with a smart mouth who deserved a strong bossy hero who would love and protect her with all that he is. Dragos was all that and more. It was fun watching an all powerful being come to terms with a loss of control. I enjoyed their story and will for sure be purchasing the next book in the series.
B001NHNG64|4.0|I feel like the author took a recipe for a book and ran it through every book in the series by just changing the locations and a few descriptions in the series.  There is always a beautiful young lady that falls in love with him and they hook up only to find that he is not through roaming and must move on and leave her.

B0036S4B6M|5.0|This book was very enlightening into the life in a Federal Prison setting.  Since I know 2 people who have actually been through this process I know that several of the things are fact and I felt that that gave credence to the rest of the information contained in the book. It was also entertaining as some of the lighter sides of incarceration were woven into the book.  I enjoyed the book a lot.
B000TDGGRY|5.0|I wish he will keep writing about Sigma Force...I am on the last book of the series I dont<br />want it to end
B00003CXI1|4.0|The &#34;Harry Potter And The Sorcerer's Stone&#34; movie is a fairly decent adaptation of J.K.Rowling's bestselling book.  The actors & actresses who were picked for the roles were pretty close to perfect and the cinematography did the story justice.  Of course, as usual I enjoyed the book more than the movie, but there are rarely times where that is not true.  It is tough to fit every nuance & subplot from a well-written novel into a single movie.  Fans of Harry Potter are sure to enjoy this.
B0060MYM3S|2.0|Everyone has their own taste in various entertainment . One of the best entertainment i know of is the Movie Industry .<br />My Hobby you might say is collecting movies . I have over 1,000 movies of both VHS & DVD's . I only like realistic Movies ,<br />Movies that are true to life and could be true not impossible to do . I found the Game of Thrones to confusing  , with to<br />many different Kingdoms , with to many different characters in each Kingdom to to follow . There is to many different plots<br />that jump around from one plot to another leaving you wondering &#34;What Happened &#34; . Throw in Witch-craft , Dragons and<br />after a while you become so confused as to who is who & which kingdom they are from . I didn't wipe it out completely<br />because i know there are people who love these types of movies which does not make it bad . It reminded me of &#34;Lord of<br />the Rings&#34; that i also did not like -------Rich mellinger
B00BRUQ7ZY|5.0|I found that Aslan, while a believing Muslim, is able to write of Jesus as an unbiased historian.  If I have any criticism of the book it is that I don't think that Aslan places enough emphasis on the fact that Jesus while being an apocalyptic prophet, also was preaching the impending visitation of &#34;one like the son of man' with God's avenging angels to wreak havoc on the Romans and those quisling Jews.  When Jesus and his followers went to the Mount of Olives along with their two swords, they expected the fulfilment of the prophecy of Zechariah where the avenging angels would appear.  Instead they were met by guards from the Temple police.

B005HJWWW8|5.0|I've had this amplifier for over half a year now and I absolutely love it! I had the E5 before this but misplaced it so needed a replacement. Went online and found this and ordered right away. I mainly use this with my Epic 4G Touch and Sony XB500 headphones and the bass is amazing, reaches levels and power that it couldn't reach before without it. It has the three EQ settings which are changed by sliding down the side slider. As another reviewer has mentioned though, you do have to be careful because to lock the device you have to slide up and and the slider clicks into place, and to change the EQ settings you have to slide down, so every now and then when you unlock the device by sliding back down, you might accidentally go to far and change to the next EQ setting. Other than that minor thing this is a great amplifier for a great price and is highly recommended by me without a doubt!
080414947X|5.0|This is another great Reacher book. I always hate to see them end and I can't wait for the next one.
B003DNN0L2|3.0|This was a cute movie, but it added way too much that wasn't in the book. I also was very disappointed in all the psuedo-ugly language in the movie. The characters say &#34;cuss&#34; instead of ugly words, but it is still crass. For a children's movie, it's just not appropriate.<br />Also, in the book, Mrs. Fox adores her husband and tells her children over and over &#34;Your father is a fantastic fox.&#34; In the movie, she is much less encouraging. Also, the children in the book are happy and sweet. And in the movie, they only have one child and he has so many issues. I'd rather not introduce my children to those attitudes and problems before it's necessary.

B00COGZ8FU|4.0|Ok, Tom Cruise pulls it off better than I would have given him credit for. My wife has read the books & gave it a thumbs up also. Not \\"Gone with the Wind\\" but a fun movie that is not too difficult to watch. Some cringeworthy pain / violence scenes but that's the genre right?
0385349947|5.0|I love this book!  I am getting my 20 year old daughter to read it too.  I think it will help her tremendously when she gets into her career.

B00DT55OGS|4.0|I really only started liking Belle & Sebastian with their Dear Catastrophe Waitress album.  Prior to that their albums were quite drowsy so I was pleased that this collection of b-sides and non-album tracks has the 21st century &#34;kick&#34; that I enjoy.  I only wish they would give more information on who sings and plays what instruments on their songs.  I even have the Fans Only DVD and B&S' unintelligible mumbling and non-desire to be pop stars gives very little clue as to who plays what.  I guess we have to take what they give (clever off-centre pop songs) and like it!
1400052181|5.0|I chose a 5 star rating because I have not been dissappointed yet with anything I have bought through Amazon.com.  I purchased the book for my step-daughter for school and it arrived post-haste as usual.  And the price always beats the price through the school.  Thank you Amazon.com!
B004LWZW4C|5.0|Worth the money and upgrade from DVD. The sound and picture quality is at it's best.<br />The price was right and shipping was really fast.
B008EZVNO0|2.0|I am a  HUGE  Van Morrison fan; have loved his music for decades and decades.  Am sad he put out this album  which (like  Bowie's last album) sounds very &#34;same-y&#34;. It makes me think of an aging baseball player who refuses to retire even though he's only batting 100. There is no stand out track....and just lands like a mish-mash of previous works.  I would say save your money and replay some old Van when he was THE MAN.

B00CUKTG2Q|5.0|Franz Ferdinand have not released a bad record yet!  Right Thoughts Right Words Right Action continues their string of punchy, almost march-like pop anthems that get your blood pumping and your feet tapping.  I haven't picked a favorite song yet.  They are all pretty even and as I continue to listen to it I'm sure a favorite will emerge.  I do wish radio would play them more so their appeal would be wider than it is.  I mean, their music is direct and to the point with understandable lyrics, mostly positive themes, and they have a great polished look about them.  Why shouldn't they be world-beaters?
B0058YPG1G|1.0|There are two major scenes in this season that are conducted entirely in Spanish with no clue as to what is going on. When broadcast there were English subtitles which were essential to understanding what was happening, but not so on the DVD. This is really a shame and frustrating to no end. Ironically, there are Spanish subtitles. What the hell is wrong with these people! It's a slap in the face of all non-Spanish speakers. Even if you saw the broadcast version with subtitles you will be hard pressed to explain to someone what is happening. Such a disappointment.

B004CLYKLI|5.0|I have literally pored through every parenting book that I can find and this one is by far the BEST! And it's not even a traditional 'parenting' book!<br /><br />My sister and I grew up being bumped around from place to place, and I have few life examples of what good parenting looks like, hence the poring through of the parenting books. What a gem this book was and I feel so blessed to have found it!<br /><br />My son is mostly black, and will attend a predominately white school - I literally REFUSED to give birth until I had received the keys to our tiny new apartment in district of one of the BEST schools in Toronto! My friends literally moved all our stuff in and set up his tiny crib while we were in the hospital!<br /><br />As he grows in this school he will begin to understand that the differences between him and the other students extends far beyond mere skin colour. Even now I am realizing as we spend time with the neighbourhood todder's - his future classmates, and their mothers, that there is an undeniable gaping chasm of difference between our styles and values.<br /><br />My son will not be able to simply destroy the property of others while I cut a cheque and sheepishly declare that 'boys will be boys'. If that happens, he can kiss Christmas goodbye! Not by choice but because there simply won't be any money left. And spending all our money on rehab and therapy?! Maybe his little friends can have a laugh at that one, but it will be out of the question in our house. If the drugs don't kill him, I just might! (kidding... or maybe not)<br /><br />I already feel alone and that other mother's don't agree with my parenting style. But they don't have my son, our genetics. I know that the sky is the limit for my son, if I can do things right, because the sky would have been the limit for me, had my parents cared. I may be hard on my son, but even harder is the anguish of knowing that you can perform better than the best, and knowing that you will never even have the opportunity to try because nobody cared, maybe even held you back. I live with that every day of my life.<br /><br />Amy's book made me feel validated and not alone for wanting the best for my son. I couldn't be more grateful because I found it just as I was at the crossroads of following the example of the neighbourhood moms, or doing things my own way. It's so easy to just be lazy and expect everything to turn out alright, especially when you're spoiled and rich. Amy Chua has affirmed and deepened my resolve to be the most active parent I can be, to recognize my son's strength and resilience and not treat him like he's made of eggshells, and push him to realize for himself everything that I can clearly see in him. That he is the BEST.<br /><br />I can't begin to describe what a difference this book has made for me, and my son, future Multiple Olympic Gold Medalist.<br /><br />As Robert Frost so eloquently wrote :<br />I shall be telling this with a sigh<br />Somewhere ages and ages hence:<br />Two roads diverged in a wood, and I--<br />I took the one less traveled by,<br />And that has made all the difference.the opportunity to try because nobody cared, maybe even held you back.

There has been no \\"warming\\" since 1998, record amounts of arctic ice, and sunspot activity signals a cooling period similiar to the one in the eighteenth century. So the stupid crap that comes out of Gore's mouth is pretty funny, like watching bad 1960s SF set in 1999, it is totally wrong.<br /><br />Greenies, sorry to insult their religion, but your god is a Southern born, Democrat a-hole.

B005DNSJB6|5.0|Every time I watch this movie I am am struck by how effective it is. I find myself ranging from tearing up to sobbing into a pillow for almost every scene. Not just because of the cruelty being committed in many of the scenes, but because of how beautiful a man John remained despite how he was treated. The movie is a perfect blend of brilliant acting, filming, writing, music and story. Please watch WITHOUT popcorn.

0143034901|1.0|As a very infrequent reader of fiction who was given TSOTW as a gift and in view of my skepticism of anything so popular, I decided to estimate my chances for a really unpleasant experience by consulting the 1-star and 2-star Amazon customer revues for this book. Ultimately, I came to agree with many of the criticisms advanced in these 87 essays: over-the-top dialogue and plot twists, superficial characterizations, chauvinist treatment of women, repetitious atmospherics and so forth. But my main dissatisfaction with this novel was not the subject of comment by ANY of these 87 reviewers and it arrived long before I was halfway through the book. On the very FIRST PAGE of the story, I was stopped cold by a sentence near the bottom: \\"My father and I lived in a modest apartment on Calle Santa Ana, a stone's throw from the church square.\\"<br /><br />Anyone familiar with Barcelona knows there is NO SUCH STREET as \\"Calle Santa Ana.\\" There IS such a street in Madrid and, no doubt, in other Spanish cities, but not in Barcelona. In this capital of the province of Catalunya (Catalonia in English), the street corresponding to the one named above is \\"Carrer Santa Anna.\\" You also won't find \\"Avenida del Tibidabo\\" (mentioned several times in TSOTW) in Barcelona but, instead, \\"Avinguda del Tibidabo.\\" Similarly, Barcelona's most celebrated boulevard is the \\"Passeig de Gr&agrave;cia\\" and not something starting with \\"Paseo.\\" These discrepancies are connected with the fact that more than one language is spoken within the country of Spain. While the majority in that country and their counterparts in Latin America speak the Castilian dialect (a language commonly known as \\"Spanish\\"), the native language of Catalunya, Valencia, the Balearic Islands and Andorra is Catalan.<br /><br />The Catalans are a long-suffering and heroic people, oppressed for hundreds of years by intolerant, Castilian-chauvinist monarchs, dictators and, even, elected central governments of Spain. Worst of all was the oppression of Catalunya under the clerical-fascist dictator, Francisco Franco, who never forgave their valiant struggle against him. The Generalissimo harbored a deep hatred of this revolutionary, anti-clerical province, with its history of workers' struggles and its \\"foreign\\" language and culture. After his 1939 victory in the Spanish Civil War, Franco carried out a relentless campaign of punishment against Catalunya, imprisoning and executing his political opponents, attempting to squelch its industrial development and banishing the Catalan language and culture from public life. Castilian became the sole legal language. It was only after Franco's death in 1975 that mass popular struggle forced the central government to yield regional autonomy and language rights to Catalunya.<br /><br />The author of TSOTW, Carlos Ruiz Zaf&oacute;n, is a native of Barcelona who lived there for nearly the first 30 years of his life. Did he identify with the struggles of his native land? It appears not. Various evidence suggests that Zaf&oacute;n has a Castilian family background and was raised and educated in that language. He has stated that he is not a Catalan nationalist, which certainly is his right. Nevertheless, he chose to set his first, serious, adult-oriented novel in Barcelona. Is it not reasonable, then, for a reader to expect a novel that is permeated with the flavor of this great Catalan city? Sad to say, that essential flavor is lacking, as in garlic soup without the garlic.<br /><br />Throughout TSOTW, Zaf&oacute;n used the names that Franco decreed for the streets of Barcelona: Castilian names. Some apologists claim this is nothing more than historical accuracy, that Zaf&oacute;n was merely reproducing the actual situation in the period of the novel: the 1940s and 1950s. In my opinion, if this was his motivation, then an explanatory footnote with an apology to Catalan sensibilities was absolutely mandatory, a matter of common decency. But there is no such footnote.Its absence serves both to confer legitimacy on Franco's Castilian chauvinism and to yield to the Spanish majority's linguistic narrow-mindedness. Evidence that I am not alone in noticing this neglect may be found in the Wikipedia piece on TSOTW. Under the heading \\"The Civil War and Franco dictatorship,\\" the unnamed commentator wrote: \\"Absent is any reference to the Franco regime's efforts to suppress the Catalan language . . . or to that language at all.\\"<br /><br />It is significant to note that Zaf&oacute;n wrote TSOTW in CASTILIAN and that the Catalan version of the novel, published several years later, was produced by a TRANSLATOR, not by Zaf&oacute;n. (Was he not sufficiently proficient in the language to produce a Catalan version or was he simply not interested in doing so?) But the absence of Catalan flavor in TSOTW extends well beyond the Castilian street names. Among the novel's large array of Barcelona denizens, for example, there are hardly any with traditional Catalan names. The given name of leading character Juli&aacute;n Carax would be Juli&agrave; in Catalan. Similarly, Daniel's beloved might have been called Beatriz in Madrid, but in Barcelona, she would be known as Beatrice. We find authentic-sounding Catalan names only among the novel's very minor characters, like the cross-dressing watchmaker, Don Federico Flavia i Pujades (a near miss for Zaf&oacute;n, though, because Federico is Castilian; in Catalan, he would be called Frederic) or like the owner of the Santa Lucia hospice, Baltasar Deulofeu i Carallot \\"the bastard son of a salted-pork entrepreneur and a fallen debutante, who was mostly known for his escapades as a professional gigolo and con artist\\" (Zaf&oacute;n at his excessive best!).<br /><br />Remember \\"Els Quatre Gats\\"? It was mentioned several times in TSOTW as a romantic place for a drink or a snack. Why was the caf&eacute;'s name rendered in perfect Catalan? Why did Zaf&oacute;n refrain from turning it into \\"Los Quatro Gatos\\"? Was the name simply too famous to \\"purify\\"? (It was Barcelona's version of the world famous \\"Le Chat Noir\\" of Paris.) There also is a little problem associated with the use of this caf&eacute; as a meeting place for its characters during the era portrayed in TSOTW: Els Quatre Gats, founded in 1897, went bankrupt and closed in 1903. It thereafter became the headquarters of the quite respectably Catholic \\"Saint Luke Artistic Circle.\\" (I doubt that a nonmember could have popped in there for a brandy or a ham sandwich, even if such items were served.) Franco's mutinous earthquake that began the civil war in 1936 triggered an anti-clerical tsunami that swept through Calatunya and destroyed many religious institutions. The \\"Circle\\" closed up shop at that time and Els Quatre Gats did not reopen as a caf&eacute; until 1989. Why was Zaf&oacute;n willing to indulge in such an anachronistic use of a Barcelona landmark if he was so concerned with \\"accurately\\" rendering Barcelona's streets with their Franco-era names?<br /><br />Finally, we arrive at the book's \\"walking tour\\" epilogue, \\"designed to give a flavour of the setting for The Shadow of the Wind . . . .\\" A \\"flavour\\" of the REAL Barcelona, perhaps? Sorry, no. Instead, a \\"flavour\\" of Zaf&oacute;n's Castilianized Barcelona. In the two pages of maps and in the pages of text that follow them, we again find \\"calle,\\" \\"avenida,\\" \\"plaza\\" and \\"paseo\\" throughout. Also \\"Puerta del &Aacute;ngel\\" (instead of Portal de l'&Agrave;ngel) and (the unkindest cut of all?) \\"Plaza de Catalu&ntilde;a\\" (instead of Plaça de Catalunya)!<br /><br />Somehow, though, this re-christening process was erratic. Thus, among the five sections of the Rambla, we find the names \\"dels Caputxins,\\" \\"dels Estudis\\" and \\"de Sant Josep.\\" Similarly, among the various \\"calles\\": \\"Ferran\\" and \\"Jaume.\\" What happened here? Did Zaf&oacute;n & co. miss the fact that these are Catalan names? Or did they run out of enthusiasm for their renaming project? Since this \\"walking tour\\"is meant for present-day readers, appeals (by uncritical Zaf&oacute;n fans) to Franco-era street name \\"authenticity\\" no longer apply.<br /><br />With regard to Barcelona, Zaf&oacute;n has stated \\"I'm haunted by the history of my city.\\" For many who also harbor such sentiments, it is sadly ironic that his \\"haunting\\" was manifested in Castilian and not in Catalan. Whether from indifference or from malice, the author of this world-wide best-seller has banished from its pages the Catalan essence of his native city even more effectively than the Generalissimo hoped to accomplish with methods of brute force.<br /><br />Barry Freed<br />September, 2013d famous \\"Le Chat Noir\\" of Paris.)

B007STBUIW|5.0|Awesome! The picture was restored - sound was amazing.<br />Helps it was 1 of my all time favs.<br />Really worth it for the quality on blu ray.
B005UG542S|5.0|Very easy to watch love quality of movie very happy with results will deff purchase movies like this its easy
0307730700|5.0|Author, Eric Blehm has written a truly inspiring story of valor.  He relays the account of Adam Brown, a young Arkansas man, who overcame his inner demons and a troubled past to become a Navy Seal Team Six Operator.<br /><br />Adam's wife, Kelly stood by his side throughout the entire ordeal -- believing in him, helping him overcome drug addiction, and cheering him through the grueling process of becoming one of the nation's most elite warriors.<br /><br />This is a story of redemption, courage, humor in adversity, faith and ultimate sacrifice.  A very compelling read.
B00COGZ8FU|3.0|Movie good.<br />Connection was terrible again, continues to stall and buffer and even shut down Roku. Netflix or Hulu does not do that. Please fix or I am going to stop renting from you.
1847940684|5.0|I didn't know about this book until my boss recommend it.<br />After read half of this book already I think it is very good and gives some insights very interesting on how to deal with activities and get them out of paper on daily basis.
B00005RDRO|4.0|If you are a fan of mystery novels and old mystery movies, than you should like this film.  Neal Simon's spoof on the old mystery writers, full of well known actors of the day.  The humor is both witty and tongue in cheek.  I found it worth adding to my library of films.
B004QZ9PLU|5.0|Awesome!  I love all the stories I have read by this author thus far. I am looking forward to his next story already. I would like to see The Best of Me become a movie. That would be great!
B00CMQX84A|5.0|I bought this for my granddaughters birthday and she absolutely loved it.  She has 2 other sisters and they watched it together,.  It was definitely a very good purchase.  Would make a great gift for the up coming holidays.
B00CMIK9D6|5.0|Fantastic, love it, great dance music too! remind me of Jacques Brel in some songs. promising future. should be played in the U.S.
B00B2JSRAS|4.0|Reading this book Lifted my spirit and gave me renewed hope! :0)<br />I enjoyed reading it and trying the experiments with my kids!!
B000FBFML6|4.0|Fitz Chivalry Farseer, now back at Buck Keep Castle to take on the duty of teaching a young Prince Dutiful, the ways of the 'Skill', finds himself entangled in many events unfolding there, as well as trying to keep his return a secret from those who believe him dead.  A good read, but recommend you get the first three novels; 'Assassin's Apprentice', 'Assassin's Quest', and 'Royal Assassin', before you delve into the books in this series.  All are by Robin Hobb, who brings all the characters to life very well.
B003VANOFY|5.0|I love how when someone busts into your room you can just flip the mic up and it auto mutes, no need to flip a switch or button.  The sounds is 100% amazing.  Combined with a sound card you have a stereo system on your head basically.
B008OOYALE|4.0|Awesome game that is hours of fun! Do not have to purchase anything, as you can receive gifts from friends and can hatch different dragons. BUT patience is a virtue here.... However it's all worth it for these cute, colorful lil guys and gals
B00EFB8UHU|5.0|Great! love it. When is the U.S. going to start playing French music or even worldwide music.  Bored with the English.... this country is so homogenous. they don't let  hardly anything in when it comes to foreign tunes
B007REV4YI|5.0|As usual...007 is a great series... excellent print and voice quality... no complaints. Planning to buy the entire 007 series.
B0091REZMW|4.0|Great game, very addictive. only annoyance is the energy timer but I suppose that just makes me do my days jobs in between ;)
B005544TRQ|5.0|I've heard about this show but I thought it was another &#34;lawyer&#34; show, but it's not.  The characters are well developed which make it interesting.
1878424319|3.0|need to find some new wisdom...all of this is circa 1960's and the baby boom generation still reads and is interested.  Some should be teaching it.
B00DR0PDNE|3.0|If you watch Netflix and don't want to spend close to a hundred dollars for the ROKU, then this is a must for you. I've used the PS3, Nintendo Wii and Android PC to stream Netflix on my TV with high-speed internet, but the quality on the Chromecast is much superior. Although, please note that if you don't have high-speed internet, you may not get the same quality. I've done an apples to apples comparison using the same internet speed.<br /><br />That being said, my primary reason for this purchase was to use the browser and cast directly onto my TV. It works! But the quality is very poor. Unless you want to read articles on your TV, movie streaming is very choppy, poor at best, it's nearly unviewable. This is very important because I have a laptop that surpasses Chromecast's minimum PC requirements for browser tab casting. I have a quad-core i7 chip. Just to be fair, this functionality is still in BETA.<br /><br />I own an android mini pc stick, which I use to stream video and movies on my tv now and I was hoping that the Chromecast would replace it. But unfortunately, the quality doesn't even come close and it won't be replacing it anytime soon. For the time being, it's only use is Netflix, for everything else, it's either the android mini pc stick or hdmi cable connection.
B00F8L2VO4|5.0|I've learned more Spanish in the three months that I've been using this app than I did in three years of high school/college classes. I'm so glad this is now available on Amazon so I can use it on my Kindle Fire as well as my phone! And now that they've added voice recognition to the mobile app it's even better... Oh and it's free and doesn't have any ads! Can't get much better than that!
B009LDCZ7I|4.0|Homeland Season 2 is not as good as season 1 was but it's still a good drama series and still worth watching if you don't mind a dark and adult-themed show.  This season just could not quite match the intensity of the first season.  The acting is still very good.  Claire Danes is once again outstanding as barely stable CIA operative Carrie Mathison.  The rest of the cast is still very good, especially Mandy Patinkin as Carrie's mentor at the CIA.<br /><br />Spoiler Alert:<br /><br />This season sees Brody (Damian Lewis) transformed into a CIA asset as Carrie and her CIA team turn him against his al-Qaeda captors.  There is a great deal of irony in this script and by the end of season 2 it seems that season 3 will find us completely reversed from the plot in season 1.  In season 1 Carrie was the only person in the USA who believed that Brody was working for al-Qaeda and was about to commit a terrorist attack.  In season 3 it appears that Carrie will be the only person who believes Brody is NOT a terrorist bomber.  Big time irony theme going there.<br /><br />So, bottom line, I still recommend this series for those who don't mind a dark and adult themed show, but it has taken a step back in the intensity of the drama from the first season.  Perhaps they will get that back in season 3.
B0000669JL|5.0|Have been a huge fan of Marley for years and lost most of my cd's in an accident. Ordered this gem because most of my favorites are on here and I am so glad I did. Very pleased.
B00CDT41RY|2.0|No real social value; just triggering emotions.  It would have been better to take into account a broader view of history.
B006WQLH7G|3.0|I downloaded this app to help protect my Kindle since my kids are always downloading things on it. Can't be too careful with technology these days. It says that it's protecting my Kindle, but that's it. I never know if it does scans or anything. I have Avast! on my laptop and love it though!
B00EYN3HTA|5.0|Peter, Enchantment and Stardust is the follow-up to the excellent Peter: A Darkened Fairytale, taking a poetic look at the magical world created by Mr. O'Brien. It is broken into segments to provide the reader with guidance, unfolding much the same as the novel before it.<br /><br />To highlight a  few of the many quality poems here, a particular favorite was Zombie Queen. The opening lines \\"Full of scabs and rotting flesh/Stench like sick from the nest,\\" paints a vivid picture in the reader's mind, setting a course for where the rest of the prose will go. It is vivid, solid imagery that invokes all the senses.<br /><br />Another is Quengorn, which for those that read Peter should be a welcome reminder of a favourite character. Here, a line that really jumps off the page is \\"Feel my claws squeeze into your back/It's all over... take a nap,\\" putting the reader on the receiving end of a majestic bird of prey. It is evocative storytelling at its finest, done with a bare minimum of words.<br /><br />A final one that definitely needs mentioning is The Gift. The line \\"Boys and girls with new beginnings/Innocence blessed, never sinning\\" speaks to deep-rooted sense of lessons learned and hope for the future. It is inspiring and uplifting, the kind of poem that although is found in the middle of the work, could easily be the closing number.<br /><br />All in all, this is another excellent work in the world of Peter by Mr. O'Brien. The style of the poetry is free-flowing and lends itself to easy reading, propelling the narrative forward. The word choice throughout is outstanding, as is the imagery. Will be enjoyed by readers of all varieties.
B009XIXVU6|4.0|I liked it because the story had so many different view points.  Was the ending expected, yes some, but the story was worth reading to get to it.
B000002IAZ|5.0|Great mix of a great band. I really only bought this album for the song 'For what its worth' but am very pleased with it.
B00DAPOHU6|5.0|If you are a fan of his earlier stuff you will dig this album. Slighty better than his last two, and a return to a more organic sound. Its worth purchasing
B008XG1X18|3.0|I downloaded this app thinking I would use it for all the neat ideas, but I find myself not using it as much as I thought. Although, there are some awesome things that I have tried so far!
B004HWYTP4|5.0|I had a good time when I was watching even though this was my second time. Recommend it! Funny and a kind of action.
B00D7Z4GQY|5.0|the ending was not what I expected, but I did know that a circle had to be completed some way.
B00DUGCLY4|4.0|This was a great game. It's free and really fun. Some of the questions are hard but the overall game is great!
B00785P2QC|4.0|Great.  Lots of fun. Good interface.  Played original game an its fun to be able to put buildings where you want
B00DQVSTCG|5.0|Watching this you realize the talent that she is and how she has inspired all the other people in the music industry. She really is remarkable and inspiring.
B00F91H666|5.0|Makes me want to fire up steam and play some zombie maps...very similar.  They move fast, make crazy screeching noises, and you have to fill them with 1,500 bullets before they die.
B009NFHF0Q|4.0|Unbelievable and yet believable. What was true and what was imagined? You make up your own mind. Good to read.
B005CGI4EG|5.0|Who doesn't love Al Bundy?  America's dysfunctional family is back with a vengeance in this series.  I am a big Married With Children fan (watched it religiously when it aired on Fox).
B007IXWL2C|5.0|I could not put the book down. I read it in 1 wks time. The storyline draws you right into Anastasia and Christian's world. It makes you laugh out loud, shed a few tears, wait in anticipation with your heart racing and it completely captivates you. It is never predictable because just when you think you know what is about to happen next, you are completely swept away by what actually happens. Can't wait to read the whole series over again!
B009LDD54K|5.0|I absolutely love this series! I don't have the HBO channels and just can't wait for the seasons come out on DVD!<br />They get better and better every year!<br />This year stayed at a resort for a week with a girlfriend and we had a Boardwalk Empire marathon with all 3 seasons!<br />It was one of my best vacations EVER!<br />Now have to wait another whole year for the 4th season:(
1933771690|2.0|Biocentrism is a difficult book to understand its premise. I don't believe the authors ever make it clear how life and consciousness are the keys to understanding the universe. It's a kind of the chicken before the egg or the other way around with no answers for the unanswerable. The theory of biocentrism as the an answer does no more for me than gods, an intelligent designer, or ant other theories. One thing the authors do bring out is the great question of how our world is so planned for life existence, but is biocentrism really a clear answer?
B00B7FOQCK|5.0|Product works perfectly with my macbook pro retina. I've had it for a couple of weeks and am very happy with it. I highly recommend it.
B00AREIAI8|3.0|It's good. Fun if you like repetition. Kids will like it though. I recommend it for all audiences. It's educational too. Teaching on how to take care of horses.
B00992CF6W|5.0|I loved this game when r u going to add updated 8.0.<br />Aren't you going to add in endermen ,cave systems and<br />infinent worlds
B00DYCBH4O|5.0|I really like Jane Austen's books but I prefer this one in particular. Classic romance, I guess women would like it best.
B007J4T2G8|5.0|Will be getting the next one<br />With great anticipation hope the next one is just as good and looking forward to it
B002L3ARRU|5.0|Its just one of those movies you have to see. Tons of funny scenes and a great, yet simply, storyline.
