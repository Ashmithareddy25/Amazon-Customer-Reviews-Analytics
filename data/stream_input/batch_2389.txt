B0034DGPEU|4.0|This is a deeply moving story of how slavery was tragic not just for African Americans but for the whites as well. The intertwining of the black and white stories is masterful.
B003ODIZL6|5.0|I kind of like this dictionary because it gives you a deeper meaning I loved it awesome job<br />In creating an dictionary with meaning
B0072OFOM6|4.0|While I don't feel like this season compares to the first season or even the follow up prequel season, I felt it was a successful comeback from a situation that could have been derailing, namely the death in real life of the main character's actor. Coming back from that with a lead worthy enough to play Spartacus helps their cause but the plot doesn't feel as tightly woven as previous seasons. Yes we get some great moments of Vengeance and some major deaths but I felt like they should have held back in some regards in terms of those chosen to die. Regardless, this is a great season of a show which I find is compelling and worthwhile to watch.
B004UHL9EK|2.0|why in the world does a stop watch need full network capabilities?  why does it need access to protected storage?<br /><br />if you are like me you wonder why and won't install, even if its the BEST app in the universe.  What's next?? we give all apps access to our credit reports, bank accounts and credit cards with out user intervention or knowledge?<br /><br />I know that there is a list of permission listed, but then they sneak a couple in when they figure everyone is just going to click ok.
B00AIUUXHC|5.0|this is the best shark game I have ever played. I think they should make another one. it is awesome!
B00BI745AA|3.0|My wife and I both loved the stage when we were stationed in NYC years ago. We made it a habit to go and see the plays on Broadway. This is not broadway - and even though we have a HDTV with 5.1 Surround Sound it's just not the same. The movie kept our interest - and it's OK.
B000005RRP|5.0|Classic, but new and surprisingly unknown release.  Although I own everything from the mighty Deep Purple including Fireball, this anniversary album took me by surprise. I was thinking of replacing the old Fireball CD I have  in my collection by this remasters CD, but after listening to this Anniversary Fireball I've come to a conclusion that it's just one more so familiar and yet so different album. The bottom line is keep them both. If you're a real Deep Purple fan you will have one more classic album in your collection.
B0067R0APK|3.0|lots of detail, but have to admit sometimes I just use the free one because it's more simple to see the weather quickly.
B0047Y0FGY|5.0|Tina Fey's memoir, Bossy Pants, was funny and poignant at the same time.  Few books make me laugh out loud, but this one did!
B004EWFV9K|3.0|Interesting but drags on and on.  I felt like the author wanted to make a very long story with a very limited plot.
B001E75QH0|5.0|I bought this set used, and just hoped for the best. Wow! I'm impressed. The DVD's are pristine and played without a single glitch. The DVD's (and everything) look just like new. I had VCR tapes of the first three Indiana Jones movies, but had to throw them away--they literally disintegrated. Now I've got the complete set and am quite pleased. This Amazon seller carries great products and provides great service.
B009IEXKXI|4.0|I know there are lots of reviews of this book but I feel compelled to add my 2 cents worth. This is one of the very best hard science fiction books I have ever read. I won't go into details here because so many others have already. I was going to rate it 5 stars but subtracted 1 star because I was a little disappointed in the abrupt ending (not going to include a spoiler, either). However the first 99% of the book is outstanding; I felt I was with him on Mars. I recommend it to any and all lovers of sci-fi
B000AMJG4Y|5.0|What can I say - this is the long awaited Final Fantasy movie that everyone has begged and pleaded to be produced.  If you are a Final Fantasy fan you already own this movie.  It was REALLY good.
0375869026|5.0|This is the best book; at a great time for the bullying that takes place in this time in our country. UPDATE: I just finished this book and I found that I didn't want it to end. I selected it for a Summer Academy bookclub for children that have learning challenges and I know it will impact their lives forever. What a wonderful book. Read it. No matter what age you are your life will be touched.
0771035799|5.0|It is upsetting how ignorant many physicians are in interpreting the results of published medical research and in applying those findings to patient care.  On the other hand, it shouldn't be surprising because physicians are not trained to be scientists.<br /><br />It's equally appalling how the pharmaceutical industry conducts its medical research (to maximize corporate profits); and, in the process, how drug companies impact the way much of medicine is practiced in this country (also to maximize their corporate profits).<br /><br />Anyone who has ever visited a doctor or taken prescription medications should read both of Ben Goldacre's eyeopening books \\"Bad Science\\" and \\"Bad Pharma\\".
B003XF1XOQ|4.0|I have loved the other books but I felt like this one was just like my life and I think there should have been a bit better ending. I'm trying not to cry now because my life is like katniss. I say if your life is not like katniss you won't understand as good but if you do you know what I mean. Trying not to cry when you know that everything that happens in this book could really happen to anyone it makes you realize that we need to know who we trust and who we love. Spoiler alert... I was so upset when prim had died after all that katniss went through for her. Another spoiler alert... when  katniss killed coin instead of snow I admit that surprised me till I figured out what she was saying and I agree with her. I will not tell you what it meant by what happened you will have to figure out what happens.

0099707004|5.0|Jeeves' droll humor while he's poking fun at his boss had me in stitches.  The humor is timeless, is spite of the fact there are no cellphones, laptops nor cable TV in this story as it takes place almost 100 years ago.
B009PK9SB8|5.0|I didn't realize how awesome this thing would be... it's so nice to be able to see what the camera is seeing!  I can set my shot up before I go on my bike rides!  And I like that it comes with 3 back doors! :)
B0094BB4TW|5.0|I love the way I have been able to find 'flashes from the past&#34;. Wish it was easier to find friends. It should have a way to separate people with the same name by asnwering or listing some details about them.
B00APUYWYA|5.0|great movie.  watched it with preteen kids (some inappropriate adult themed elements needed to be muted or missed - a little tricky). but otherwise brilliant.<br /><br />as an old acapella singer - this movie was very entertaining, the singing and performing was great - and you get to see a bit of the Virginia Hullabhoos - what's not to like?
B0063GORYU|5.0|Love it, hooked on it. Can't put it down. It's fun and challenging. Love it better than regular solitare. Should have different color and shapes.
0802473156|5.0|I would recommend this book to everyone regardless if you're single or married.  Everyone who reads this book will benefit in learning your own and your significant other's love language.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|It's the best game ever!!!!!  Especially since u can play online with ur friends. \\"Subway surfers\\" is the best!! Next to \\"cut the rope\\"!
B0073XV2W2|5.0|Anyone concerned about the direction this country is taking should read this book. A real life possibility. If not probability.
B00CDT41RY|5.0|this movie was great.  It has some of my favorite actors in it.  They did a great job!  This movie is entertaining.
B008Y7N7JW|5.0|Although, as typical with any book turned into movie, it was missing some details from the book, my entire family liked this movie.  I like how Katniss is showed to be strong but yet believable with flaws and weaknesses. Can NOT wait for the next movie this November!!
B00AREIAI8|4.0|this app is fun but,its one of those games where you some times you have to buy things called gems.like some times to train your horse.if you don't buy &quot;gems&quot; it just takes longer.besides that its fun
B0066W1AZK|5.0|Good game for all ages helps you to learn the game , it gives a change to some and helps other

B00065GX64|4.0|Disturbing melodrama at the time about a sick, terrified and psychotic child murderer. The murderer is brought to justice by the Berlin underground to face a vigilante courtroom.  Mob mentality takes over. An absolute riveting piece of filmmaking by director Fritz Lang which seems very contemporary. Dazzingly direction and cinematography for an early talkie. Peter Lorre is unforgettable as the panic-stricken child murderer.
B007IXWL2C|1.0|Badly written, shallow and  ridiculous caricatures of characters with a epileptic plot line all combine to make  this one of the worst books I have ever read. If you can get past that; the huge number of errors in this book cannot be ignored. It all adds up to a waste of your time. Check out  Sylvia Day if you want erotic literature.
B00992CF6W|5.0|I love this game, people say u can't get on servers. U need to Be on the same network. People say this glitches. C'mon people!!! Buy a new device, if u bought a Kindle plus a game, get an ipad and transfer the game in cloud. People say, IT NEEDS SURVIVAL!! Well, UR NOT LOOKING. Now I can have a chest full of diamond BLOCKS!!!

1455526959|3.0|Like most of the other reviewers, I have read all of the Harry Bosch books and I looked forward to reading this book, I ended up disappointed.  The book breaks down into thirds.  The first and last third are pretty good, the middle third seemed like filler where the author (Connelly?) seemed to be just grinding it out.  I know it may sound crazy, but this didn't seem like it was a typical Michael Connelly book which makes me ask if it was ghost written by someone else?  The cold case premise was a good way to start the book and the idea works, but there are some sections in the book that just don't work and are wasted pages.  An exmaple is there are a lot pages wasted describing the meals he had with his daughter and his girlfriend, which served no purpose other than to provide filler.  This is not the best Harry Bosch book written, and it leaves me hoping that future books will be better.
B00571F26Y|5.0|There are lots of copy-cats out there but few who actually think by themselves and go about their own path. Some come to conclusions that seem to contradict &#34;everything everyone knows&#34;, but not too seldom it turns out that everyone else actually have got it wrong. The power &#34;of everyone else says&#34; is so strong and everyone assumes someone else have investigated the &#34;truth&#34; a long time ago, but often no-one have.<br /><br />This book is interesting, well argumented and referenced, and is in itself enough to convince many people to stop eating what the food-industry is pumping out in millions of tons...<br /><br />My sister have an austistic child where it is very clear that everything containing gluten or milk affects the mood as well as the mental capacity and capability ! It may sound strange but if you had experienced it yourself this book would not be so strange at all, just a confirmation of something you already had figured out!<br /><br />For myself, wheat affects my joints and also gives me a headache.<br /><br />Don't fall into the trap of &#34;gluten free&#34; crap that just tries to mimic some high-gluten product without gluten, often it fails, and often it contains lots of strange substitutes and compunds.<br /><br />Most of the world (apart from parts of europe and USA) have no history of using wheat or milk...<br />My advice is to learn to cook asian food where wheat and milk never have been used (at least until western companies got them to go to superstores...)
B00APUYWYA|3.0|The music was terrific! The cast was outstanding! The plot was...well, ok, for a comedy! The movie was already funny.  It was unfortunate that, in order to get laughs, they had to have the lesbian character cop a feel and fall all over the other female characters. Maybe if it happened once...or even twice...it would have been ok.  But in a movie about the underdog succeeding, the nerds winning out, the fat girl being popular....it just didn't jive.
B000JMKQX0|5.0|This book is awesome.  I was a little thrown off by the lack of a linear plot at first, but it really works once you let go of your expectations and keep reading.  I have no idea how they could have filmed this.  I'm guessing the movie will be nothing like the book with only the title in common.
B006MW3UZW|5.0|Great entertainment.  Waited a long time to see this show after listening to many reviews along with workd of mouth praise.
B00BHNQ5XK|5.0|I wasn't expecting a lot from this film but it was so much better than I expected.  The tension really builds and the ending was a great twist and totally unexpected.  It's not jump out of your seat scary but definitely worth watching.
B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|Amazing how similar it is to Ken Folletl's epic novel, Fall of Giants,  What an amazing time that was.  World War I was supposed to be the war to end all wars.  Part II in Ken's Century Trilogy will most certainly prove that wrong.
1416575464|4.0|If you love the magazine, you'll love the book.  It's pretty much a best of compendium.  Great room layouts, good ideas, not much practical advice.
B0099Y2YL6|5.0|Absolutely wonderful series. I can't wait to be able to acquire Seasons 2 and 3 so that I an enjoy them as well.
B00BHU2A7I|5.0|Excellent film and Anthony Hopkins is brilliant.  It's based on the production of Psycho and I learned a lot that I didn't know before the film.  I'd recommend it to anyone that's a fan of Psycho or Hitchcock films in general.
B000059T00|5.0|The album sounds amazing. I had this on vinyl with all the pops and static, this is so clean. What's not to like?
B00ABO573A|4.0|I really don't understand some of the negative reviews on this film.  Maybe you have to be a gay man to appreciate the story line.  I could really relate to the plot line on so many levels.  It really resonated with some of my personal experiences and with experiences of a lot of my friends.  Well done indie film.
B008602KQI|5.0|More times than not, movies with this much theatrical hype are disappointing, but this hits the mark. Very rarely do I want to read the book after I've seen the movie, but this one appears to be one of the rarities that has be searching for the next step.
B0043JDUNS|5.0|I've always loved the Ironman series.  I find it to be the most successful of the Marvel comics films, probably due to Robert Downey, Jr.  I'm waiting impatiently for Ironman 3.  I'm not a fan of Gwyneth Paltrow but I can deal with her character in these films.
B0076HNCTQ|3.0|I find it harder and harder to go back and watch the 1970's and 1980's style of television. Melodrama and poor acting seemed to be all they had then. I know this was the fore runner to all the really good televiision that followed this era, but i couldn't get through the pilot without getting bored.
B00BF123WG|4.0|Very nice! I only wish some dialogs were not as fast paced, because it was hard to follow some scenes. But overall it is an excitong movie that really catches your attention
B0071XO8RA|5.0|I have been meaning to read these stories for awhile. And I'm not sure why I waited so long. Pick it up you won't be able to put it down
B005LAIIKI|5.0|I'm a huge Tarantino fan, and this is one of his best. Great cast as always, and once again Christoph Waltz does a phenomenal performance. Very violent, but you should expect that from Mr. Tarantino.
B000VC76JU|5.0|I love this and it works very well.  I will keep buying more due to the cost and quailty of the product
B00A7OIXW6|5.0|I love this movie! It's so clever, and anyone who grew up with &#34;old school&#34; video games will really enjoy it. I'm so tired of Pixar always winning the Oscar, when movies like this are out there and deserve to win.
B004JN1CW4|5.0|I was a little worried when I first started reading the series, there weren't very many good reviews. I take a chance because I was looking for a new dystopia series while waiting for the third book in the divergent series by Veronica Roth. After searching for a dystopia I came across the James Dashner series of the Maze Runner. I have to say I was extremely pleased with the entire series starting with the Maze Runner then the Scorch Trials and finally the death cure.I was a little disappointed in some areas. any and I would recommend a series to anyone who is mesmerized by the dystopian world and all of Its possibilities.
B0071XO8RA|5.0|I have the habit of finding a series I like and reading it start to finish. I've read the popular spy novels, war tech, detectives, historical novels and more. I found myself wanting something different, more fulfilling, more satisfying. Not that there aren't good stories and storytellers out there, it just mostly variations on a theme. And then I found \\"Wool\\". Wow. Science fiction, but not nerdy. Compelling, well written, engaging, thought provoking.<br /><br />You know you have found something when you reread passages just because they are crafted so well. You know you have found something when you find yourself thinking about the story during your workday. I'm 85% through the Wool Omnibus and don't need to finish it to know I will be reading everything by this author. Bravo.
B007J4T2G8|5.0|Ones you start reading this book,you cannot stop until you finish it. The book is breathtaking,obsessive  and life-changing . Everyone has<br /> to read it!!!
B0038BBA4I|5.0|If give it ten stars of I could.  I haven't been this excited over New music in years a long time
B005MLOKXA|4.0|Interesting people and cases make for an interesting show. Following the tradition of other law-firm shows the Good Wife mixes legal cases and the lives of the lawyers into some solid entertainment. If you liked past series of law shows such as LA Law and Boston Legal, I think you will enjoy this series, though it doesn't seem quite as quirky as those shows and characters.
B0094BB4TW|1.0|I've set this up to not give any notifications or to check for updates or anything else and it is still turning itself on constantly wasting my battery. It is also fairly slow compared to other apps I use.
B000XUBFE2|5.0|Every once in a while you come across a book who's words and images never leave you. The Book Thief is one of those rare gems.
B007Z9QP3K|5.0|This was one of the most exciting movies I've seen in a while.  It brings real U-Boat life and takes you to the fight.
B00BWJ7LYG|5.0|Can't wait to see the rest of this story. Great acting, fantastic production values, excellent direction..<br />stays true to the tale... and is in perfect keeping with the LOTR films. Must see
B00992CF6W|5.0|WARNING: ADDICTAVE It took me a while how to make the things in survival mode, but it was so fun!!! I LOVE THIS GAME, everyday I play it for hours!! It is TOTALLY worth 7$!!
B00CDT41RY|5.0|A brilliant piece of work.. acting directing .. the whole enchilada. Great cast, excellent script.<br />I see nothing controversial in the film. I cheered when Jamie whipped that a hole.
B0043RGXJS|5.0|I really enjoy Michael Buble whatever he does whether it be singing or just talking. He is a great performer.
B000JMKTLO|5.0|This is a riveting story that I could not put down. It took turns I never expected. You will not be able to put this one down.
B00005JL0I|4.0|I thought that It was funny and there was a plot to get David Niven (Sir James Bond) out of retirement to find out who is kidnapping or killing agents around the world. Confusing the enemy with other James Bonds of 007 male and female. Lots of beautiful woman who played leading roles in this movie Ursella Andress, Suzanne Bischette, etc.. A Documentary special feature on the making of the movie explaining the roles of Peter Sellers, Orson Wells, etc.<br />  Then theres another Special feature on the 1954 Casino Royale with Berry Nelson, Peter Lorre and Linda Christian. However, It is lacking the last 2 minutes of the movie.
B001OQCV6A|5.0|This movie is great and it is also wonderful that see Robert Downey, Jr. back and at his best.  I love these movies and I hope he makes more of them.  The man that plays his brother is excellent in his character and admired by me.  I saw him on the Graham Norton Show (BBC Network) and he is just as witty and funny and his character in the Sherlock Holmes movies.
B000JMKQX0|5.0|This was one of the best reads I have had in a long time.  It kept me up reading into the early morning.
B00992CF6W|5.0|I Think it is the best game ever!! When I started it I didn't know what to do. But now it is awesome!!
B000KRNCYY|5.0|If you love Celtic Woman, or even like them, this CD is great--good music, good selection, good harmony, all around lovely music you can listen to over and over and never tire of.

B005KDWUFA|5.0|Love it--especially the first song, wicked game sung in Italian.  Terrific combo of voices, love the way the intensity builds through the songs, love the selection of songs==good listening.
B007URVZJ6|5.0|The guidelines provide a simple method of getting your books published without all the hassles of sending out proposals and manuscripts to publishers who send out automatic rejections or the many you never hear from again - Not even counting the cost of mailings and time wasted. In the 21st Century of publishing, this is one of several more modern methods of getting your books to press.
B0096BIENY|5.0|Love it, love it--love the combination of the 4 glorious voices, the songs, the way they build the intensity during the songs!
B00B935SUY|5.0|Without too much self-serving vanity Dave Grohl revisits a wonderful history of a slice of pop music history. This is a documentary that musicians recommend to one another. In addition to the particulars, it is a clear an honest look at the art of the studio, and the importance and vibrancy of real playing vs the digital creation of musical artifacts. But it doesn't point fingers, and also gives a fair assessment of the value and inevitability of digital while celebrating performance, musicianship, while featuring some major contributors to the art of contemporary pop and rock.
0440246008|5.0|This is another of Lee Child's books with Jack Reacher as the main character.  As in all other of his books this is an exciting read.
B007CKNX28|5.0|Wonderful record, Jack White is getting better every day. The best deal? Got a digital copy on my Amazon Player and a physical CD. Great!
B007TXN4TK|3.0|Takes some getting use to this one and how it works. My grandson likes it. thought it was going to actually allow me to learn to play but I have not seen that in the thing, thinking of uninstalling it.
B00C7TAF3Y|5.0|Takes advantage of everything the kindle fire has to offer! Puzzles were challenging. Best game ever!! Can't wait for another one!!!
B0066WJLU6|5.0|Comes in handy very cool and bright. I use when my other half is already in bed and I dont want to turn on a light to disturb him
B008PALI5S|2.0|I'm sorry, I really wanted to like this disc, but it falls well short of the mark.  I'm an audiophile first, a classical music lover second.<br /><br />Granted, this is a Herculean undertaking, but this production falls short on so many technical counts, it is difficult to enjoy the performance.<br /><br />First, it's dark, the stage at the facility in Venezuela is not well lighted.  You spend most of the disc hoping someone will turn up the lights.  Second, Dudamel is out of focus for the entire performance.  Can't decide if this is a \\"depth of field\\" issue because it's so dark, or that the \\"Unmanned\\" camera focused on his position is simply out of focus.<br /><br />Like the cameras, the microphones appear to have been placed and not mixed or managed.  Far too much emphasis on the surround sound levels, causing the listener to put up with the sound of hundreds of squeaky metal chairs in each ear while attempting to follow the performance.<br /><br />The performers deserved better and I'm a little surprised DG put their name on this one.  Perhaps it is a far better stereo CD than a multi-track video production.<br /><br />Save your money, pass on this one.  If you want to see Blu Ray done right, treat yourself to Mahler 2 from Accentus, Riccardo Chailly and the Gewandhausorchester Leipiz.  It too is available from Amazon and could be used as a \\"Master Class\\" in how to do Blu Ray production of large-scale symphony orchestras.  You won't be sorry...<br /><br />UPDATE:  Just purchased Mahler 8 Blu-Ray with Riccardo Chailly on Accentus Music (Available on Amazon).  It is everything this Dudamel disc is not.  It is spectacular, and now my \\"Go-To\\" Mahler 8 disc....
B005K17RU0|5.0|I thought this was my comments  but this thing requires a certain amount of words (20) to give feedback. Stupid!!! what do you think?
B006MW3V6U|5.0|This series shows the aristocrats and servants and their lives. It is interesting to see how their relationships intertwined. The series is beautifully filmed.
B001V7UXG2|5.0|I love Woodhouse since I was a young fellow. This series is a wonderful recreation of the most remarkable character created for the english writer. Thanks for the adaptation and the extraordinary acting.
B007GE2H3G|1.0|Jen<br />The whole movie is violent, hand guns, machine guns tanks, kid knapping, robbing, drunkeness.  Don't let your kids watch this if voilence is a concern.  This is migrated!
B0055V6EZE|5.0|Seeing  \\"doctor House\\"  doing something different of sending someone to hell is a miracle that me and my family enjoyed  a lot. Laurie is a great musician and blues singer who shows his love to jazz as many english musicians did before .
B009AMANH4|4.0|I bought it because of my interest in American History; it was good, but not all I expected.The actors were outstanding,however.
B0022Q8CSC|5.0|As a die hard fan of the movies, I was urged on by my father to read the book, and in all honesty I have to admit that even though the movies are great, the book brings to life aspects that were not caught in the film. If you love the movies, you will love the book.
B00AF6MF9I|3.0|This game is kind of good. But it's nothing (Italisize nothing) compared to clash of clans. At least gameloft didn't try to take our money again.
B00B2V66VS|4.0|temple djn is fun to me but the only thing is,is that u habe to pay for like coins and gems and other things i mean like come on the game doesnt even have a facebook sigh in it only has twitter
B008HK3XU4|5.0|This makes life so easy and the fact that one's Kindle turns on as soon as you open the cover makes life much simpler without having to look for the little button on the side.  Once you select the angle at which you want to view it, it doesn't move.  Great. Would definitely recommend to this to anyone.
B008N9AAQ4|5.0|I bought this video on a recommendation of reviewers at AVS.com because it has great material that help see the potential in HD TV's. It was really an amazing movie that show different parts of the world. It looks great on my samsung. I would definitely recommend this to anyone.
1616890835|5.0|This book is an incredible &#34;blast from the past&#34; for us experienced old school sign painters. The book posits the notion sign painting is enjoying a renaissance after nearly three decades of computer driven cookie cutter signs being made by people without traditional design skills or talents. I'm slowly seeing this happening in my market area and couldn't be more happy. Excellent read with very high qulity images.
B004UHL9EK|4.0|This is a usable app, but it's missing some polish. Almost every action requires two presses. It really needs to have dedicated start/stop/pause buttons on the timers on screen. Also missing is a copy function. Instead of copying the default cook timer, I was forced to create a tea timer from scratch. Backups are a nice touch. I would be slightly disappointed had I paid for this app, but, since it works better than the free app I had, I'll stick with it, hoping for some UI polish in a future update. One star lost for lacking a clone feature. Harsh, but that is a essential feature to me.
B0089LOKHG|3.0|This book could have been so much better, I was so disappointed with the ending.  It wasn't closure enough for me, but at this point it is what it is.  It wasn't my favorite in the series but I had to finish it to see what happens.  Most of the book was great, you could kind of see where it was going, but again disappointing ending.  I will however continue to read Lauren Oliver books to see what she has in store for us next.
076781326X|4.0|What a perfect movie.  No wonder it got so many awards.  But, my DVD has two sides and they are not labeled correctly.  Side A is really Side B
0765325950|5.0|A Memory of Light was the perfect ending to a wonderful series.  This book is filled with action from cover to cover, and it more than delivers on the promises of the previous books.
B00005QZ7U|5.0|This movie is one of the few that I can go back and keep watching it from year to year.
B00CDSVZHY|2.0|The movie was great but I ordered HD and although I got a warning that it would be downgraded if my service couldn't stream HD. I'm ok but during the 24 hours we watched twice and the quality was bad. I would have to seriously think before I order from amazon again (HD)
B0000VCZKM|5.0|I used this DVD with my kids at the elementary school.  It teaches many vital lessons about history and about life.
B005LAII80|5.0|Years ago I watched the over-the-top Sylvester Stallone version, and that experience almost kept me away from this movie.<br /><br />Excellent performances by Karl Urban, Lena Headey, Olivia Thirlby, Wood Harris, and Domhnall Gleeson.
B004UHL9EK|5.0|This is a great timer. You can have multiple timers saved. I love the trigger function. You set one timer to trigger another, start the first one and the second one starts as soon as the first one goes off. I see this being very useful. The stopwatch and alarm clock are just basic. No different than the ones that come on my phone (nexus 4). But I still gives five stars for the timer and plan on keeping this app just for that. I hope multiple stopwatches will be added in the future. Still great faotd.
B006GHA9QQ|4.0|I am a big fan of Andrew Lloyd Webber and I really enjoy the Phantom of the Opera.  I enjoyed the cinematography in this sequel, that they did from the play.  The music, while not as good as the haunting music from Phantom of the Opera is enjoyable and fater a few listens to it, it grows on you.
B009O2XY12|1.0|download problem, game is frozen once you hit play so I can't honestly say if it is a fun game.
B001UV4XJ2|5.0|just loved the story plot, the production, and the great action throughout this great movie, ending this wonderful series.  the best in the series and can watch it over and over again. well done. well done.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|I'm a big horseback rider and this made me think of my ranch!!!<br />Really good to have when you're bored!
1564148793|5.0|been having problems for years and could never figure out why. this book helped me see what the problem was and also helped me put a stop to all the problems that i was dealing with these many years. it taught me things i never new about or even that there was such a thing. this book was well worth the money i paid. i would recommend this to others.
B0081L391C|4.0|So fun these guys were great and the cameo with Johnny and Peter was awsome. I loved 21 Jump Street has a kid and glade there is a movie now.
B001UV4XHY|5.0|well it was a good movie, but i though it was a bit slow and i think it could have been made better. i know it was made to lead up to the next movie but it could have more action in it. do not get me wrong it is a good movie. it just feels like it was missing something.
B00466HM28|5.0|The product works great out of the box.  Just have to do a few adjustsments in ableton in order to use the knobs, but no serious issues.
1589795474|5.0|I love how this book gives you a better understand about money and how the author identifies wealth.  One key factor to being rich is to live frugally while accumulating wealth. A definite buy for any friends and family struggling financially, but also great for everyone who wants to make smarter decisions financially.
B004RX03NK|5.0|Best album of all time hands down. I feel bad about only giving it 5 stars. Buy several. This album should be a million times platinum.
B003U6BE8I|5.0|A good movie for all ages.  Helps to know Greek Mythology to understand who is who in the Characters of the show.
B004GYY714|5.0|Great alternative to the others offered. No buffering or annoying commercials and great variety of music and talk from all over the world. ** I am now addicted to podcasts!*
B002SVBDYQ|2.0|I was a fan of the movies and wanted all the best songs but now I am just vamp'd out.
B007REV4YI|4.0|I can't seem to get enough of Jame's exploits. They, the various writers seem to pubs the boundaries quite easily. It was very entertaining. I am a watcher that comes in sits down switches off an want to be entertained. I thought it was awatchergood show. Looking forward to the next one.
B0062LU85S|2.0|Loved the movies, but my love did not withstand the test of time. All vamp'd out. Sick of people with complexions like a gravestone.
B004UHL9EK|5.0|I love this apps! That what I want!!  It's,much better than android stock OS..<br /><br />Samsung Galaxy S Relay 4G<br />Android 4.0.4
B001JOIEZ4|2.0|The real issue I have with the songs from this CD is that I am just sick of vampires. Once a fan of the movies, I'm just vamp'ed out.
B004AP9W46|5.0|What does it take to enter the mythical Christian afterlife place called heaven? You have to forgive yourself and forgive the deity referred to as ‘God’ by the western peoples. This, to me, was the best of Anne Rice’s books in the Vampire Chronicles.  Interview with a Vampire and Queen of the Damn (book not the silly movie) were also good, but Memnoch was the best. Mrs. Rice explores the mind of the deity called the Devil/Satan.  It explores a plausible treatise on the Christian religion She explores purgatory and what it takes to cross into heaven. The brilliance of the two conditions, ‘forgive self and forgive god’, is demonstrated as it is truly the only two concepts it takes to worship the Christian god.  Most Christians have to apologize for their god’s inactions and the way life goes.  Then they have to forgive themselves of the guilt of all the things they have done. This is one of the best fictional accountings of Western, and especially the Catholic, dogma and beliefs and their failure to address the human condition. It will make you think. Bravo Anne Rice for that!
B005DOJ68K|4.0|Flashback to the Oldsmobile driving too fast all around the back roads. Great music then. Great music now. Glad I got to cherry pick the ones I wanted to keep from the past and the ones I didn't.
B0094M4R3Q|5.0|Very good family movie, our grandgirls kids loved it and I would recommend this movie to anyone at any age group!
B005VXK5RY|5.0|Loved em in the past. Love em now. Their words and music withstand the test of time. Awesome. Get some~
0307352153|5.0|If you have ever been described as introverted, shy, too quiet, anti-social or accused of not participating or not leadership material, this book will change how you have been taught to think or feel about yourself.  Every teacher should HAVE to read this before they ever enter a classroom.  Every parent should memorize this book.
B00594XOZU|1.0|I used to love kik, until a bunch if weirdos and creeps AND pervs looked me up, yuck!! If you're a real nice gal or guy & don't like being bothered by the likes of pervs, creeps, stalkers,& weirdos, DON'T, and I mean DON'T get kik messenger!!!
B007FEFLTO|5.0|Thank you Ken for another great read, THIS IS WONDERFUL hiSTORY AND FICTION ALL WRAPPED UP IN ONE BOOK. Highly recommended reading.
0316069884|5.0|I want everyone I know to read this book. I was a vegetarian before reading it, but I've never really cared to convince my friends and family to follow that lifestyle. I never wanted to be that annoying person who tried to impose her beliefs on others. After reading this I feel an obligation to make sure they all know about the evils of factory farming.
B00A6PD9I4|3.0|I ordered Brave for my 3 yr old daughter to familiarize her with the film before we went to Disney on Ice but she didn't sit through the entire movie (as she does with others).  The arguing between mother and daughter, the men fighting for Brave's attention, the very vicious bear fight. It's for older kids, I guess. Still a bit too much fighting and not enough comedy or humor.
B0028RXXE8|5.0|This is perhaps merely a soap opera in costume, but I loved it.  Among other things, it sent me back to read Shakespeare's \\"Julius Caesar\\" and to watch \\"I, Claudius\\" again, which despite -- even, perhaps, because of? -- a lack of production values, remains the great televisual introduction to Rome-based drama.  \\"Rome\\" lacks Graves's Livia -- she lived later in history, but I am not sure that any other fictional character can ever match her -- but it is full of interesting characters, whom a viewer can vilify or with whom identify.  It is also self-revealing, in that I found myself pulling for Pullo, the sociopath, instead of Vorenus the prig.  Well-written, well-acted, beautifully filmed.  Highly recommended for adult audiences.
B009WO7NQO|4.0|Best birds I've played, would recommend this to all my friends. boba missions are really tough even with walkthroughs though.
B00004YM0D|5.0|Bought for a friend, and his only complaint was one of the songs in the movie was not on this soundtrack.  I told him that it was the only Soundtrack and that's the way it come.  Not my fault.<br /><br />But he loves it.<br /><br />Carolyn G.
B008OPZYNQ|5.0|The DVD arrived much earlier than I expected it would and is great quality. Thanks heaps. Also the film is fantastic.
0061900656|5.0|I specifically wanted a book for my two year-old about becoming a big brother that had a positive tone to it. This fit the bill perfectly! It does assume that the baby is already here, but we only have a month to go so I'll adjust the story slightly until then.
B000AJIF4E|4.0|The sound is superb. Some other reviews led me to worry about comfort, but I found the phones light, well-fitting and not too tight. The only reason I did not give a 5 is that the item description mentioned a &#34;9.8 foot&#34; cord, which I wanted so that I could sit in my chair a reasonable distance from my tv and amp. However, the cord is a very tightly wound spiral that requires a good pull to get it beyond 4 or 5 feet. It will GO to the full length, but the tension practically pulls it off your head and I need to hold the cord in my hand or wrap it around something to take advantage of the full length---and I still worry about putting that much tension on the jack. Otherwise, it is well made and the sound is marvelous.
B007V2UGPE|4.0|Nice game and kids love it, needs to give balls or charms regardless if level won or loss to encourage more playing
B0031RAOVY|5.0|Got it for the wife as she had seen it on TV and wanted it. Makes a great chick flick.
1439153663|5.0|I read this as a book club selection.  I found the book very interesting and it provided a glimpse into American history during the 1850s forward.  I have loaned it to two people and they both loved it. (One found it depressing.)
B00BB8RKH6|2.0|The only part of this movie I liked was the plane crash in the beginning.  It was action packed and suspenseful, and Denzel Washington is amazing.  But after that the movie spiraled down into a depressing account of alcohol and drug addiction, and how addiction will destroy your life and the lives around you.  Depressing.  This \\"Flight\\" should have been canceled before take-off.
B009X01FJS|4.0|I really like this case. It is very functional and cute. The only complaint I have is the Kindle doesn't always automatically come on when you open it like Marware claims it does. Other than that, it's great!
B004UHL9EK|5.0|This app is a stellar piece of programming.  It has so many features that it boggles the mind.  The graphics are beautiful, the options are endless, and the voice used to announce the alerts sounds cooler than Siri.<br /><br />And before you assume that the app is lacking a feature (like I did, bad user) check out the Preference Menu.  The option is probably set somewhere in there.  You can customize things like Timer Sort preference, and Timer Tap Settings.  The timer tap settings will allow you to tap once on the timer to start/stop it instead of pulling up the control menu (which is the default).<br /><br />I also liked the log export feature.  I was able to export it and email the .csv file to myself.<br /><br />The only thing that I can nit-pick about this app is that the menu icons are not very intuitive.  It took me a while to figure out what each icon did.  Especially the Sort Icon on the timer page.  That one  had me stumped for a while.  And the only bug I found (using on a Kindle Fire HD) was that the app froze when I tried to select a custom icon picture from my shared library.<br /><br />So this is probably one of the most useful apps I encountered so far, and one that I will actually keep on my Kindle.
B00498XRPE|4.0|Sci-fi suspense/horror<br />Strong female Hero<br />Classic Ridley Scott<br />First of a series<br />It is a must see for anyone interested in the above subheadings.
B005K0HDGE|5.0|If you are a Stephen King fan, as am I, I believe you too will love this book.  In typical King fashion, it is like nothing you have ever read before.  It is about trying to change the future by going back to the past and changing the events that led up to the tragedy;<br />ultimately the death of President Kennedy at the hands of Oswald.
B000059GEI|5.0|Do not love this moivie at all because Marily Monroe has anything to do with it--she could be totally out of the movie and that would be fine with me.  It's about the Donohoes.
B007V2UGPE|5.0|This is one of the best games I have ever played. I would recommend this game to anyone. This game is AMAZING.
B004XJRQUQ|5.0|I got so emotionally involved with the characters that I cried often, especially in Mockingjay. You've bonded with the characters by then and I could hardly put the book down to go to work every day. I am sad that it is over but look forward to the 2nd & 3rd movies so I can enjoy it (and be terrified) all over again. I'm so sad it's finished :-(
B00BB8RKH6|5.0|Powerful movie worth watching. Valuable lesson to learn on so many levels. I have recommended the movie to many friends and their thoughts of the movie are the same.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|I love playing this game it feels like I have my very own horse I strongly recommend it to everyone .
0143122916|5.0|Where do I begin? You MUST READ this book! No ifs, ands, or buts because why in the world are we not talking about this situation going on in North Korea? Why are we not teaching about this? Why are we not doing something about it?<br /><br />I think about what I know about North Korea and realize it is very little. I know the leader scares me a bit, but I had no idea how bad it really is. As an educator and parent why do we not raise the awareness? We teach about the Holocaust and other terrible moments in history, but why not teach about this? This is our modern Holocaust. We always talk about making history and our teaching relevant to our kids. What will they say when they realize they lived through such a terrible moment in history and had no idea?<br /><br />I am beyond blown away by what was documented in this story and journey of Shin. What I like about the book is that it is real. There is not a fairy tale ending(although I wish there was for his sake). His adjustment to the real world is never going to stop. I cannot believe that a human being survived what he did.<br /><br />There are no words to put down in this review to explain what you will read about Shin and the life he lived. You have to read it for yourself. I feel shocked that I know so little of these events. I had to stop reading this book at times. Not because it was bad, but because I just could not endure anymore events that Shin went through. I needed a breather from the abuse. I could not stay away for long because I had to know what was going to happen next.<br /><br />Read this book. If nothing more than to bring awareness to things happening in this world right now that we are clueless about. I guarantee that once you read this book, you will want to help raise awareness.
B00BD2DRHW|5.0|This game is pretty cool. It's not addicting, but  I love it. I guess that if you don't like building than you will think it sucks.
B000002J0N|5.0|As usual, the music is under rated and timeless. I think seperately these guys are fabulous, together they set an incredible standard.
B0064X7FVE|4.0|It works excellent and provides all the info as their network channel. My only gripe is that there are too many objects crammed onto the screen; it's too busy and loses a point for lack of clarity.
B00AOB40CY|1.0|I just purchased this HD video for my Kindle and the video keeps pausing. I've never had any problems with any other downloads before. It's very annoying.
B0058VW36U|5.0|I love this game I have on my kindle and my ipod. I just wish it had a free version. But I still love this game it so fun!!!
0316228532|2.0|First of all, I absolutely loved Rowling's writing style in the book.  Her storytelling is fabulous and I was completely charmed.  The book moves at the glacial pace that small towns typically do and I enjoyed that.  The characters were all facinating in their own unique ways.  Yes many were cliches but aren't we all cliches when it comes down to it.  My biggest complaint was the ending.  THERE WASN'T ONE!  It felt like she got to a deadline and simply stopped. Instead we are left with a deeply depressing ending with nothing learned and nothing gained by any of the central characters.  So I spent many enjoyable hours meandering through this small town but ultimately what was the point?  Sorry JK but I need a little more.  I don't need a happy ending but I need to feel like there is an actual point to a story like this.
B00AA0TZTW|4.0|This is typical Hendrix. I enjoy the quality of this CD.  A good addition to my collection. Recommended for any true Hendrix Fan

B0064X7FVE|5.0|I like this app. It has great graphics and is easy to use.  Just what I needed. I would rather use it on my kindle than on the pc.
0984725113|3.0|Two-thirds of this book is beautifully succinct and yet remains insightful. The mechanisation of the production process, whether in the manufacturing or services sector, is inevitable and will have a deleterious impact on labour's ability to sell its labour power - we 'race against the machine'. Unfortunately, I cannot give this book more than three stars because the end third, specifically its recommendations, are the same recommendations a neoclassical economist would have who has never even considered the impact robots are having on the prospects for employment. Without explaining what they mean, the authors start saying that labour should not be 'racing against the machine', but should be 'racing with the machine'. Lexicology aside, what does that actually entail? Apparently it means that most of the population should turn into entrepreneurs, despite there being no precedent for such a transformation having been possible or desirable (yes, many were self-employed during the nascent stages of the Industrial Revolution, but they were engaged in non-entrepreneurial tasks such as basket-weaving). What happens to those entrepreneurs that fail? What happens to those who do not have the enterprise? Well the solution for them is the typical supply-sider argument that labour should be rendered more 'flexible' and more highly skilled. But surely that doesn't halt the inevitable mechanisation of even these tasks?<br /><br />Don't read this book looking for answers, but do read it for a common-sense argument for why the digital revolution really will change the capitalist mode of production (specifically its employment of wage-labourers) forever.
B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|A Must see if you missed the last season. Wonderful episodes, just like the first two. Now, I can't wait for the fourth.
B000JMKQX0|4.0|The great thing about the zombie genre is the seemingly limitless opportunities for social commentary. The original 1960's Star Trek offered the same type of vehicle. Most of the negative reviews on this forum center around the style of writing - a collection of short stories with no link to each other. I disagree - the link is that each one contains a nugget (or several) on the human condition. The fact that these come from all over the world, each with a unique cultural spin makes it all the better. As a zombie fan, I thoroughly enjoyed this and would recommend it to others who like the genre.

B008JFUO36|2.0|I am a big sci-fi fan and was really looking forward to seeing Oblivion.  This sci-fi post apocalyptic earth movie has great computer graphics but my wife and I felt the movie was long and tedious even though it's only 125 minutes.  Even Tom Cruise and Morgan Freeman can only do so much to save this movie.
B007REV4T8|5.0|This is IMHO the best James Bond movie EVER!<br />This is not a flighty opinion either, I own all of the others and have a love for the franchise.<br />Craig has grown into the Bond we knew was there, hoped was there in the last two outings, a fully developed character with a supporting cast that really works this time around!<br />Skyfall tugs at the heart, teases the future while honoring the past.
B008B68IV8|5.0|At first when I heard my granddaughter wanted one of these monster dolls I didn't like the idea, until I went online to see them, they are just adorable.
014241493X|4.0|I really liked the book! I think that the author did a really good job! There were a few parts that were really suspenseful and scary but there were still some really funny parts. There were some slow parts but they weren't too boring. I think there should be a sequel because the story doesn't seem finished. If you like mysteries this is for you. The book is definitely worth the price! (or should I say worth more than the price because the price is less than $10... lol)
B0071XO8RA|5.0|Holy smokes!! I am rarely this entertained by an ebook, much less sci-fi. All I can say is that Hugh Howey made me stay up most of the night reading because there was no alternative. I absolutely MUST know what happens next. Don't even try to wiggle your way out of it, Howey!

B000FC1LOC|5.0|I told a handful of people I was reading this book and they all said the same thing back, &#34;You're going to cry!&#34;<br />I read through the entire book and although it was truly heartwrenching I didn't shed a single tear until the end. The twist is so incredible and sad that I probably should have seen it coming, but when it came I was totally unaware and cried for a good five minutes. Maybe you're tougher than I am but the twists and silly little tidbits in this story boosted me to a Five-Star review.
B005ERIRZE|4.0|The Willpower Instinct is based on a course the author gives at a prestigious american university. She covers a number of ways to handle your willpower but ultimately, it becomes about mindfulness about our cravings, urges and decisions. There were a number of good lessons: the white bear exercise, you and you 2.0 and surfing the urge.<br />A study asked participants to not think about a white bear. It was pretty much impossible. The only way to escape an undesired thought is very counter intuitive: allow it to enter your consciousness. Simply allowing it to enter and observing it will not hurt us is quite powerful. If you've ever been anxious or woken up at night praying you'll fall asleep you'll know when the white bear applies.<br />You and you 2.0 observes when we procrastinate we think you in the future (you 2.0) is more energetic, happier, smarter, stronger and less stressed than you. When you can accept that the future you won't be Superman but the same old you, you might just get things done straight away.<br />The last strategy I'll discuss involves the intense observation of addictive urges - some might think this applies to alcoholics only, but anyone who looks at their cell phone more than they like or drinks coffee as a habit is an addict in my mind. In this excercise, smokers were told to spend an hour and a half going through the steps of lighting a cigarette, without touching the flame to the cigarette and surfing but not satisfying the urge. Taking these steps, smokers were able to resist their urges much more easily a week later.<br />The tough part of the book is reading it slowly, maximum one chapter every three/four days (ideally one per week) and using the strategies. Isn't it ironic reading the book properly requires above average willpower? Just like any self help book, for the book to work the reader needs to participate to make it a success. Aren't they going to write the book that the reader only has to read and all changes will be complete ;-)? Good luck and enjoy - don't expect miracles, expect some sensible, well-researched advice and strategies that if employed might help make the change you want.
B0024FAR5M|5.0|This show is amazing. I can not wait for the next season to start. Hot guys and hot exciting action.
B0011KQSZ4|5.0|With a incredible cast, this movie was destined to be a riot. With some outlandish events taking place at a funeral, there's no way it could be handled in a dignified way. Great movie and great time.

B00729GQ0A|4.0|The Forever Girl is incredibly well written. The characters are imperfect and real and I fell in love with them in Part 1 so I had to purchase the rest of the book to find out just what the rest of their story was. The plot and subplots were rich and full of depth, and contained twists and turns that I never saw coming but loved when I discovered them. I look forward to reading book 2 and hearing more of this story.
B007SGM084|5.0|When i started reading, i could not put my ipad down... So glad i vought the bundle because its a bit cheaper than buying one book at a time. Read the books twice and might read them again when im bored. :)
B008JGSM6G|2.0|loading sucked and the game was very slow compared to all the others<br />I have. Very disappointed in this one
B00BGIC4I6|4.0|Relatable, but not as funny as I expected.  Still very good and entertaining.  I don't have a problem with swearing but some of it (from the kids) was unnecessary.
0741470314|5.0|This book will really open your eyes to the to the hellish life he had to live for about the last 10 years of his life. And you will understand why he lived as he did.I found this to be an honest portrayal of his life as seen through the eyes of those closest to him. If you already love Michael this will book will truly touch your heart.  It made me feel good that someone was finally defending him and helping us understand his difficult life.<br />If you're one who still believes all the media hype then maybe this book will change your mind.An absolute must have for fans.<br />As always, We love you Michael and miss you much.

B0032KNA4I|4.0|Almost everyone discusses the plausibility  of the film, the CGI effects, the plot, acting etc.  This is only a review of the actual quality of the transfer to Blu Ray.  I do have the Standard Def version but this really is not a side by side comparison of this enjoyable popcorn movie.<br /><br />The Video transfer is pretty clean with realistic colorations and natural skin tones.  The CGI effects while coolly color graded slightly blend in very nicely with the real camera work.  I saw no artifacts or aliasing at all and could not see any green screen halos around the actors either.  I do think that there was some crushing of the blacks in some scenes which reduce details a bit but this was not very often.  Contrast was quite good and, despite the many scenes where stair stepping could have been produced, I did not see any.  The Mbps rate varied between the mid teens and mid twenties.  In truth, the original Standard Def version also had  pretty decent imaging and I do not think that this film was truly remastered for blu ray but you will see sharper imaging throughout most of the film.<br /><br />The Audio is certainly the star of the transfer with superb use of all channels in its lossless DST MA 5.1.  The dialogue is crisp and clean and very transparent.  The audio engineers did a fine job of audio steering to both the front and rear sound stages with a multitude of discreet channeling to every speaker in the home theater.  Audio panning across the front stage is great but also pretty common with Blu Rays but the audio engineers obviously took great pains to make full use of discreet channeling to the rears.  While huge explosions and waves, buildings crumbling all envelop the listener, there was also an extraordinary amount of the smaller foley fx coming out of both the right and left rear channels that were completely discreet.  Panning from the rear to the front stage and diagonally was also plentiful. For a film such as this, your LFE sub channel will earn the money it cost you to buy.  The audio for 2012 is completely DEMO worthy to show off any home theater.<br /><br />With this single disc version, most of the extras from the Standard Def version have been left off.  While there is commentary and an alternate ending that can be found on the SD DVD, all the deleted scenes have been left off as well as other extras.<br />Included was the Ultraviolet code which you can supposedly download but I couldn't figure out a way to download to my iTunes library without also installing some kind of other application which I am loath to do.<br /><br />I would say, that for the great audio alone, this was a worthy purchase for me for $8.00 at BB.<br />All my reviews regard only the quality of the transfer to Blu Ray and hope this review has been of some help to you in deciding your purchase decision.<br />Thankse money it cost you to buy.

B0009P5YXO|5.0|I bought this for a friend that loves Doctor Who for his birthday and the loved it more than i though he would and I'm not a Doctor Who fan but it looked pretty damn cool.
B006WXHJGC|5.0|So many have discussed their opinions of the historical accuracy, acting, storyline, plot evaluations etc, I won't be redundant but just review the quality of the Blu Ray disc itself.  I picked this up on a lark at BB for 8.00 and, originally, had been disappointed with the film when I saw it in the theater.  I am not disappointed any longer.  The Directors Cuts adds an additional 15 minutes that beautifully fleshes out the action and characters.  It reminds me of the original release of The Abyss which left everyone confused until they released the brilliant extended cut.(still waiting for its release on BluRay)  The additional 15 minutes of scenes are not something picked up off the cutting room floor, they should have been included in the theatrical release and, if done so, would have avoided the critical panning and relatively poor box office results.<br /><br />The Video transfer is really quite clean with realistic color grading and skin tones.  There was a slight desaturation to the color grading which matched the bleakness of the middle ages and monochromatic colors of clothing worn by all but the most wealthy.  I saw no artifacting, or aliasing at any point.  Stair stepping, which would have been particularly noticeable during crowd scenes was not in evidence.  The Mbps rate averaged in the mid twenties.  All in all, a very good transfer to blu ray but I do doubt that this had been remastered.  The original was also decent so it was probably a simple format transfer.  While I like the easy to negotiate Universal interactive menus, there are too many things that take up disc space that could be devoted to a higher Mbps rate and thus a better video image.  I don't use BD Live and doubt many do but it takes up room on the disc.  Likewise, previews of other films also take up valuable room on the disc and force you, the consumer, to pay for advertising,  There is also a Pocket Blu App, huh?<br />Video: 4 stars<br /><br />Never the less, extras included some deleted scenes that didn't even make it into the extended cut as well as a long documentary with interviews on the making of the film.  As I said, I was initially disappointed in the theatrical release but the extended version is excellent and makes me wish they would continue the story in a 'Robin Hood-Rise of the Arrows' version.<br /><br />Audio: 5 Stars.  The lossless DTS MA 5.1 creates a clean and transparent sound stage for both the front sides and rears of your home theater.  Dialogue is easy to understand and there need be no roller coasting of your remotes volume to adjust at any point in the theater.  The film has a plentiful amount of discreet channeling not only to the front sides but also to the rears as well as panning of audio between the stages.  Your sub LFE channel contributes greatly to the ambience but does not intrude into the environment.<br /><br />You will be pleasantly surprised by Extended Director's Cut of Robin Hood and I do recommend the Blu Ray purchase.<br />All my reviews reflect only my evaluation of the actual transfer to Blu Ray and its quality and I do  hope this review has been of some help to you in deciding upon your purchase.<br />Thankseted scenes that didn't even make it into the extended cut as well as a long documentary with interviews on the making of the film.

B004GHNIRK|4.0|It is a very good story, but too wordy.  Too much detail about wars. Good thing my and reader has a dictionary for many of the words.  I am still trying to finish it and find Cosette back in the chapter with the title Cosette.<br /><br />I am a fast reader but this book is a challenge and slows me down a lot.

B003G4W49C|5.0|Enders was respected more for what he thought he could do than all the rest of the students except for the 5 year old.
B00AB2NYNC|4.0|Excellent music and very good quality, the extra DVD was a big bonus and so much cheaper than in Australia.
B007WFR0QS|5.0|I heard &#34;Breaking the Law&#34; and knew I had to purchase this album. Admittedly at first only four songs stood out to me as being really good. But by the third day of listening I was in love with the whole album and lifelong Emeli Sandé fan.
B008JGSM6G|5.0|Very addicting! Fun to play. My 3 year old likes to play too. It is a great way to keep you entertained

B000VM9Z8K|3.0|Out of all the books from this author I have read, this one just didn't pull me in. It was a good read, don't get me wrong. But it took me a while to get into it and there were too many loose ends.left in the ending.
B007REV4T8|3.0|was buiness as usual in the 007 movies thought maybe it would change up a lil but not a chnce same stiuffey cheesey jokes and plots from the  007 seroies doubtfull if they should make any more unless they chnge with the times and spice it up a bit 007 was always known for gadgets and new things in spy game and action and sex  and violence to it seemed they are now making politicaly correct 007 movie with blazey politicaly correct non sense rolled into it not what a 007 moview should be its was dispointiong to say the least
B00A0MJA1I|5.0|Nice movie for both girls and boys.  5 year old thinks it is great.  2 year old thinks it is scary.
B008RA3X5E|5.0|I love how you can play your own music to wake  up to.  I also love all the different clock styles....so easy and fun!!!
B00005N6KG|2.0|I purchased this headset because I wanted an over the head style because I have very small ears.  It worked great with no wind.  As soon as a wind gust it blew backwards.  Did not work for small ears.  Sound quality was good.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|THIS BOOK WAS AMAZING!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!<br />One of my most favorite books of all time!<br />I love the Hunger Game so much!!!!!
B007MDB548|5.0|My daughter loves tinkerbell and this one is about sisters.  This movie is super cute and has very pretty graphics.
B003DKJ5ZU|4.0|\\"Tinker Bell and the Great Fairy Rescue (Two-Disc Blu-ray/ DVD Combo)\\" is terrifically enjoyable for the young-at-heart no matter the age. We all love Tinker Bell and have since she first appeared in \\"Peter Pan.\\" So put this Blu-ray/DVD combo in your player, sit back (with or with the children and grandchildren) and enjoy!
B00A80SHFM|5.0|I you saw the move you will love this cd to listen to over and over again.<br />Transports you back again to the scenes in the movie.
0240815807|5.0|Mixing is an art. Sometimes, as a former recording engineer producer, I fear that it is a lost art. That is why I was so pleased to read \\"Mixing Secrets for the Small Studio\\"<br /><br />Many of us these days have access to small studios, with production boards that don't look like they belong in a railroad switching tower. Having that gear and have the skills and understanding to use our mixing equipment effectively are two separate things entirely. That is the value of \\"Mixing Secrets for the Small Studio.\\" It leaves little out and assumes little by way of prior experience. It's the rare books that can benefit the beginner, the intermediate and, yes, even the advanced audio mixing artist. Well done!
B0091LS07E|5.0|Did you know Bob Dylan mentions A. Keys in one of his songs?<br />Wonder why ? Just listen to this talent.<br />Is it really fair to give all that musical gift of writing and voice and \\"out of the box\\" musical thinking AND SUCH BEAUTY to one person ?<br />Of course, she paid her dues to rise above the odds of success of the N. Y ghetto.<br />Cream rises to the top.
B001THZAAI|4.0|I first saw this while visiting a friend in France. I enjoyed it then and I enjoy it now! No stabbing, shooting or beheading!
B001M0HGR2|5.0|Yeah...took way to long to see Ironman 1. My Wife and I rented the Amazon instant video yesterday and after a FAST 2 hrs., We said let's watch 2 now.....just as good! I always wondered why talented R.D.Jr. Would want to get involved in a simple action movie, but this is a developed character and is challenging to an actor of his caliber.
B005S9EK5Y|3.0|In spite of all the hype, I was a little disappointed. I'll take a live performance any day. Meh! It was okay.
B0045XGRQE|5.0|Really had fun can't wait for 3. Watch these and get ready for the new Ironman 3. 2hours of fun per movie!
B0071XO8RA|5.0|Very fun read not exactly sci fi but definitely a unique story.  Kudos to the author for such a well written story
B004LROUW2|5.0|This story really kept me engrossed in the relationship between Aumame and Tengo. It was a great fantasy concept!<br />Recommended to anyone who likes the stories like 1984.
B004ZMWUCU|5.0|Irish tale that keeps on tellin' Now my wife is starting ito read. Kindle is a great system for vacation reading.
B00ATDOVNK|4.0|A bit shorter than some other adventure HO games but nice graphics and story. A little pricey at $5 but I love this genre so I didn't mind.
B0059XTTW8|4.0|Very good Spy  Story, I read the true story last year. This drama is pretty faithful to the original &#34;Mole&#34; Story, Thanks for a great monie, John
B00BHHIWQO|3.0|It was okay, but, I really wasn't into the game, so, I deleted it off my Kindle. Sorry about that.
B009ZZDNT6|4.0|I like this app it is cute and functional<br />I test it for an appointment and it worked great.<br />I do like clocks and this is a good fit for me.
B0094BB4TW|5.0|I've used facebook for a long time, and like the interaction with others on it. Also, it's pretty easy to navigate.
B006LSZECO|5.0|My book club mixes up serious literature with lighter, more fun, less taxing on the brain reads.  I wasn't expecting much more than pure entertainment from this book, but was delighted with not one, but two, plot twists that took me by surprise.  This book is beautifully written, fast paced, and fun!
B00B2V66VS|5.0|I am not sure which one I like the most but I believe this one is  easier than the first. Lot of fun.
0060558121|2.0|I enjoyed a lot about the book, but I found that he jumps to asides frequently in the book. Many of them are unneeded or unwanted. Much like many of Steven Kings older books.
B004MC8CA2|5.0|I am happy this app is available. I try and read my bible daily. What I like most is the read<br />Along. This helps me to hear the correct pronunciation of many words.
0765316994|4.0|I found the book to be quite amusing. It felt like a classic space western, like Star Trek, but doesn't take it seriously.
B00BSBVLF8|5.0|I loved this! I saw Ka at the MGM Grand back in 2006 and was emotionally overwhelmed by the experience. It has stayed with me as the most amazing production I have ever seen, so when Worlds away came along and incorporated elements from Ka, O, Viva Elvis, Beatles Love, Mystere, and Zumanity I was thrilled to watch a new story unfold among those familiar elements. It has very little spoken conversation but it honestly doesn't need it. It's a wonderful story and visually stunning. I highly recommend it for all ages!
B00CEIGYAG|5.0|Daft Punk returns with a funky beat, an almost entirely analog experience, and Pharrell Williams providing a divine lead vocal. Its a tease of Random Access Memories but certainly a well thought-out tease.
B009KKLQKO|4.0|I was lucky to see the Beach Boys in concert 50th anniversary edition at the outdoor Sandia Resort Casino amphitheater in Albuquerque after the 4th of July holiday. They sang for nearly three hours! I watched the DVD and I finally figured out what was going on. What is on the DVD is just the second half of the concert. The first half is missing for some reason! Hopefully someone will release the entire concert soon. The concert was wonderful watching the group with Brian Wilson joining the band. It looks like he's looking at an electronic prompter with the song lyrics. The one thing I was disappointed with is the lack of interaction of each member and also the lack of any dialogue about the songs by the band members during the show. I read that the Beach Boys have disbanded once again so enjoy what you have of the group and this DVD. I recommend to buy it and enjoy it with friends.
B0064TVQ5E|4.0|Nice relaxing challenge for the thinker. I continue to challenge my highest score to solve the puzzles in less time.
B0070NSPCU|5.0|This is a good story were the hero has earned respect and does the right things but struggles with his decisions.  A few rough patches were the story telling was rough, but the concepts and the attachment you feel for the characters more than makes up for it. An enjoyable read.
B004ZMWUCU|5.0|This was a good story but very shocking and true.  The priest<br />and nuns should have been investigated and  reprimanded knowing that they were doing the wrong things with the orphans.
B000059TCE|5.0|We're big fans of Disney and dalmatians at our home, so this set was a big hit.  It's a keeper.
B00BEZTMWW|5.0|I bought the movie for my son after he read the books.<br />He loved them both and we've been enjoying quiet a bit. I love the deal on the 5-Disc set too!
B000FC12ZA|5.0|Loved this book!  It really makes you think about your life. What's important and what's not so. Would recommend to anyone who can read.
B00BSBT8M6|2.0|There is a scene with a Hyena killing a Zebra in a lifeboat and then fighting in the same boat with an Orangutan. How can a movie with such a graphic scene be rated PG?  This movie should be rated at least PG-13.  If you have little kids please watch the movie yourself first and decide if it is appropriate for your little ones. The Rating board did an awful job in rating this movie.
B000J159N8|5.0|Mel Gibson is at his best playing the part of  Col. Hal Moore who is one of America's finest.<br />This DVD puts you directly in the line of fire.<br />If you can handle it, WE WERE SOLDIERS is for you!
B00BF123WG|5.0|the battery arrived  on day two, a full two days ahead of promised date.<br />I couldn't be happier with the product fit & performance<br />how can you beat that?<br />Great!
B008QTVNUI|5.0|When are we going to get  td see season two ?  this series was very well done,  let me know when season two is available
B008QYT7DI|5.0|I have loved de Saint-Exupery's, &#34;The Little Prince&#34; for many years. This is a very simple story of how we should respect others, what is expected of us, and of how our actions are interpreted by others; a very lovely book. I can't get enough of it and it is a favorite gift of mine to those I love.
B008AK8FHM|5.0|A very inspiring and uplifting work.  I was moved by this entire experience and felt that Eben's nearly unbelievable tale was an example of life's many close, yet hidden miracles of life.
B005LAIIGC|5.0|We saw this movie at the theatre and new instantly we would have to buy it when it came out on DVD. I would recommend for 6 and over because there are a few scary scenes.
B0064MGU98|5.0|This show keeps you coming back for more.  I'm addicted!  Great acting and fun characters I can't stop watching it!
B006MW3UZW|5.0|Watch this show. Even if you don't think you'll like it, even if you never like period pieces like this, just watch it. Now. It's entertaining and well-made with great actors. Just watch it.
B004ZGI1V0|5.0|Liam Neeson is as good in this movie as he was in Taken. Great location in Berlin Germany with the city's scenery along with the action scenes and suspense makes this a good evenings entertainment.
B00CDSVZHY|5.0|The film was much better than I expected, and everyone was very well cast. I love the German and Dicaprio really stole the show for me. My one complaint is Tarantino's cameo as an Australian mine worker. Terrible accent, physically looked out of place with the other characters, and just felt very self-serving. He should take a page from Stan Lee's cameos and dial the role back a bit.
B00BGIBVP8|2.0|This is 40 you could call a movie that is sort of a sequel to Knocked Up. This movie tries really hard to be funny but misses the mark more than it hits. The story goes nowhere and the movie is way to long and drawn out without being funny or even heartfelt in most places. It tends to get into the more annoying and vulgar territory more often than not. Not that I mind annoying and vulgar, but funny with some annoying and vulgar. The only highlight of the movie is the youngest daughter who has some funny and sweet moments and accounts for a two star as opposed to less than that. Not the best of comedies and I would recommend to skip this one unless you just have some time to kill.
B005LAJ17M|5.0|After watching the show, I now know what it was a big hit.  Just awesome! Can't wait for Season 2.
B0084IG8TM|5.0|This movie is truly one of my favorites! When i saw you get a dvd and an ultra-violet copy as well I was ecstatic. This movie practically sells its self, not to mention at a low price!
B009UX2YAC|5.0|Download was quick and easy for my kindle fire. This app is like Temple Run where you have to run and pick up things along the way, avoiding traps and not getting caught by the bad guy. It's challenging and lots of fun especially for a free app. People of all ages will love it.
B000HSKUBE|5.0|Freakish, creepy, and ugly, but riveting!  If you like subterfuge this one's for you. Ian Richardson is just over the top. One of the best acting performances I've ever seen. All of the acting is superb actually!  I didn't want it to end.
B00AZKCU7G|5.0|This is a real masterpiece and provides great insight into the inner circle surrounding Lincoln during the war and fight for the 13th amendment. I loved reading Team of Rivals, which is farther reaching than the movie but still Spielberg did a magnificent job taking different elements from the story and putting it together.
B00564GPKY|5.0|Amazing, lots of new insights. I have changed behaviors for the better.  I have even used Philosophies learned in this book at work and have gotten great results.  I am a small business owner and I feel shaping culture is important and I have begun with the help of this book.
B00BTYP6QE|5.0|If you like the previous Cut the Rope games, you'll love this one. Om Nom is as adorable as ever.
B002OMZTSU|3.0|I enjoyed it.  I was intrigued about him and bought the book. He is reasonably funny in print and not the best writer.
B005K17RU0|4.0|it's a pretty decent app. Sometimes I think it has too much going on with it. I guess that is a good thing unless you are just looking for the temp
B009QA3VY2|5.0|As the last century settles in the political and social attitudes of various families to one another and  to members thereof are treated in a complex action that is both smooth and colorful in its treatment and in its physical and metaphysical descriptions.  I picked this story after reading another by Forster.
B001I45UFC|5.0|This story had a great message that was subtly presented by one of the great Christian writers of the past century. It is appealing to children and adults.
B00B8WXFWE|5.0|Jordan I love you! The remix is my favorite :-) definite great buy! Xoxo..MARIA mix of great songs and beats
B00BEZTMWW|4.0|it is amazing to be able to feel you are part of a different world! Amazing movie! Loved it but the musical part at the beginning!
B008Y7N7JW|5.0|Streaming quality was great on my Kindle Fire HD and the movie was pretty good too :) Just got my prime account and loving it already!
B00A757EFW|4.0|I Loved it as a kid and love it still! Very easy to play! What more is there to say....
B00BEZTMFY|4.0|It's full of charm but there is a lot of added running around that I don't think needed to be there. Perhaps stuff needed to be added to make it stand up on it's own but if so much stuff hadn't been added you wouldn't need so many movies. This feels like the extended version.
B0063IH60K|4.0|I downloaded for my niece. It is a fun game to keep her busy in the grocery store! Helps keep me sain!
0805047905|5.0|so glad i found this book. my two oldest grandchildren  17, 15, loved it and now, my newest granchildren 9 mnths. will love it also. thank you for having it on your website,, now grandma is happy

B007SOQBCM|2.0|This app doesn't work well with my kindle fire. I can see usernames, but yet when i watch....everthing distorts and freezes
B00B1E6FF8|5.0|Academy award nominee for best picture and best director best lead actress Jessica chastain best director katheryn bigelow overall a good movie about the capture and killing of Osama bin laden

B00B4VI8MQ|1.0|Tried three times to download to kindle fire. spent over three hours. when reached 750 Mb of a 670 Mb download decided it was a lost cause. have had good experiences with G5 games in the past so will probably try them again but glad this one was free.
B00821PCJS|5.0|This is one of my favorite shows. And it's actually just as much about the alien invasion as it is about the drama. One of the best shows on cable.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|No fuss compelling story. Captivating and moving. Can't wait to read the next books and find out what happens to the victors!
B004G7UTXG|5.0|Simply stunning masterpiece with a soundtrack to match. Great but sad story about past events that need to be memorialized.
B004H4XLRE|5.0|I bought this toy for my son's 5th birthday, and he just loves it!!  It launches 10 cars at once, and he loves to watch them race and see who wins!  When we got, he noticed numbers above each car slot, and now he insists on the right car be in the right slot!  :-)  Would definitely recommend this toy!
1426209584|5.0|I don't really want to write an essay. And more words required, really! I'll never respond to this again; and I still need one more word.
B000VYNYN0|4.0|One of the best Horror Movies of all time!! Can't go wrong with a movie night and Evil Dead! If you've never seen this, you're missing out on a classic!
B006FO3ERQ|4.0|Canada has a unique and very creative plot, centering on events which profoundly impacted the lives of twin teenagers.  The story focuses primarily on one twin and how he copes with external events which wrench his life.  The book is very well written<br /><br />The book drags a bit as the author tends feels compelled to re-enforce his points over and over.  The author derives lessons from the events and how the characters react ans formulate there vision of how to reconcile their lives - some of which I found hrd to follow<br /><br />Overall worth reading
B008XX6J4C|5.0|This is a wonderful CD.  I listen to it alot.  I would recomend it to anyone who likes Cello, and Piano music.
B009G7ZYPY|5.0|This is my favorite of her three cd's so far. I hope she will keep recording for a long time to come.
B00632HWOG|1.0|If this is the best app that's &#34;out there&#34; for the Kindle, I'm glad I returned the Kindle Fire.<br />Don't waste your time.
1619695006|2.0|I was so disappointed.Perhaps I was expecting too much after Harry Potter but I really could have done without all of the details of teenage lust.
1594203334|5.0|Enjoyable, insightful, candid about the realities of being a mom. Great lessons from France.<br /><br />As an aside, the book's jacket cover had dark marks on it across the top, so it did not look very clean when it arrived though the book is new.
B009LY72LQ|4.0|I really like that they re-released this with 2 torsos. Bought this for my little girl, and she loves making her own dolls, you can mix and match the parts, its like legos for lil girls, who doesn't want to make your own dolls? Mine says she's like Frankenstein making her own monsters.
B0091REZMW|3.0|You cannot get all the items in a room at one time.  You have to keep returning to the same room over and over again.
B008DVJO8C|5.0|I Love this c.d. I bought it for my husband, but I think I definitely listen to it more than he does. In This Moment has fantastic music, the lyrics and music are great. Maria's voice is amazing she can do it all.
B008JGSM6G|3.0|Most of the game was easy.  There were a few 14X14 games that were challenging to me.  Overall the game was easy to complete.  I only did the free sections.
B005Y4241K|5.0|beautiful voice beautiful music, songs from other artists are awesome recommend for all ADELE FANS..this is my first cd of ADELEs music...can't get enough
B00B2V66VS|4.0|I enjoyed playing the game, improving my score and getting farther.  The big knock to the game is all the cheating that can be done on the game.  i got to the top 1% in scoring only to find out that people ahead of me had ran hundreds or thousands of meters in one game.  This was a big let down for me, because I could not be near the best unless I cheated like everyone else.
B00AO2S45W|5.0|great music a little different style in some songs.  upbeat mellow it is Dido, i would recommend purchasing now..to good to miss.
B0086700CM|4.0|I enjoyed playing the game, improving my score and getting farther.  The big knock to the game is all the cheating that can be done on the game.  i got to the top 1% in scoring only to find out that people ahead of me had ran hundreds or thousands of meters in one game.  This was a big let down for me, because I could not be near the best unless I cheated like everyone else.
B00992CF6W|5.0|its great but I didn't get it from amozon I got it from 4shared.com .easy all u have to do is type in the app u want and download it
B000JMLFLW|3.0|I downloaded this as a book to read for the Kindle PC app.  I deleted the Kindle PC app and this book.  I did not have the chance to actually read the book.
B009ZQC7MY|5.0|I really got in to the series.  It is a catching story line and the actors are believable.  Can't wait to see season 4
B00BFUUMO8|3.0|Needs more missions! Sometimes there are no missions to complete and there is nothing to do except decorate the park. Also sometimes it doesn't save and you have to redo some actions. If these were fixed it would be a 5 STAR.
0131101633|5.0|This is a great book. All the examples are of actual, working programs and it doesn't come with distracting pictures, activities, etc. that other books try to add to make them seem more interesting. Straight, dry, practical. Awesome.
B005T87QCI|1.0|everything cost more money!!!!<br />they only give you a handfull of robots the rest cost 99 cents!! each!! don't buy this game buy chaos or get subway suffer you will thank me later
B00AREIAI8|5.0|Awesome game create a horse and train and clean it. Great game for those who wish for a horse but can't have one.
B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|This show will keep you smiling and you'll also find yourself leaning in to hear the dialect and phrasings that are so uniquely British. It's a unique insight and view of a world so foreign to me. I love the historical aspect. The fashions of the day are divine. I just want to stare at them and examine the fabric and construction. Highclere Castle beckons to be visited.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|This game is awesome<br /><br />I like it very much and you will to and it is way better than temple run
B0063IH60K|4.0|Easy to play and fun. Only objection is the ads that pop up before each game. That is a nuisance
B00B6QXN56|5.0|This is one of THE best CDs I've purchased in many years.  The 2-CD set is unbeatable, enjoyable music from the first song to the last.  Beautiful guitar playing and excellent vocals.  We saw this musician on a PBS show and couldn't wait to purchase this CD; we were not disappointed.
143911000X|5.0|Everything that you could want in a Book by Barney Stinson and then some.  I gave it to a Bro for his wedding gift.
B0014J8D9Q|5.0|This movie is a classic western in the mould of &#34;High Noon&#34; and &#34;Shane&#34;.<br />Eastwood is the reluctant gunslinger as were Gary Cooper and Alan Ladd. :-)
B00008GKEG|5.0|11 hours of previously unseen footage -- the Boys & Sir George Martin were the best.  Esptien's death was a blessing to their ultimate genius. (Sad but true - although he does deserve credit until Sir George took the helm.)  And it was not too long after that, they took the 'helm' from Mr. Martin. Their genius was light-years ahead of their time.  Even comparing them to Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart & Beethoven is a complex dilemma.  True genius should not be &#34;compared&#34; but enjoyed throughout the centuries.
B0095ZQ36G|3.0|This interesting book chrinicles, for the most part, the Luftwaffe career of one of Germany's best (and luckiest) ace fighter pilots.  But given the wealth of scholarly WWII material out there, I gave it fewer stars.  It is a great and riveting story, and airplane enthusiasts will enjoy it, but even there, the real enthusiast will want more information about the planes.  The actual act of chivalry is brief in life and in the book, and still remains a mystery to me as to the pilot's true motives, It was indeed an act of chivalry, but how that fits into the war climate in 1943, the pilots' code, or the pilot's code remains unclear.  I think, to the participants there is a mystery as to why the pilot &#34;let this one go.&#34;  But I reiterate that it is a good read and well worth reading.
B0000542D2|5.0|Thank God it was in Black & White, it truly captured the dark, dank Liverpudlian atmosphere.<br />It shows us what the Boys were like before they conquered the USA and then the world.<br />A MUST for every Beatle fan!
B008Y7N7JW|5.0|Although strictly futuristic, the story is engaging throughout.  The actors do a superb job. Woody Harrelson and Jennifer Lawrence create memorable characters  Visuals and sound are good. Perhaps there are lessons about oligarchs and greed that are worthy of thought.
B00AU15HPC|5.0|I bought my first copy of Days of Future Past in 1971. All the songs were great, but everyone's favorite was (and still is) Nights in White Satin. Justin's singing on that album, many more Moodies albums and his solo albums ensured that I would buy this one. He still composes and sings wonderful songs after all these years. Any Justin Hayward fan will certainly enjoy Spirits of the Western Sky . I also hope that Justin can pick up a few new fans from this album.
B008Y6QZ56|4.0|I think some development of the characters were needed but it was enough to hold my attention. The battles were certaintly intense and helped it along at just the right moment. With that said I think the start was slow.
B000TRXRUY|5.0|I've never seen this film before and I enjoyed it for what it was.  I'm in Tae Kwon Do and my instructor loves Bruce Lee, so that was my initial reason for watching the movie.
B00C32R64G|4.0|Not their best album, but a good, solid album from Volbeat. If you like their other albums, you'll enjoy this one.
1416914293|4.0|Loved it, but not as much I loved the first one. At least I got to see more of Simon and Clary. I think it was frustrating but not like bad frustration but like AHHH THEY NEED TO AHH I JUST.. AHHH WHY WHY WHY!! For people who have read this, you understand my frustration.<br /><br />City of Ashes reveals a journey of love, loss, and laughs but most of all acceptance. After Clary finds out the truth about her past, she has to accept who she really is.<br /><br />It starts out like hours later of CoB. I was captivated from the very beginning. There's action, suspense, and some parts dragged but I love Cassie's style of writing. I think we all agree now that she is the \\"Queen of Cliffhangers\\".<br /><br />I deducted a star because of the relationship between Jace and Clary. Clary can be so very annoying at times and Jace can be still an ass but they're trying to avoid each other but can't. As for the Simon and Clary part, I liked but I had hopes for Jace. Dating Simon is like dating a brother.<br /><br />I was still convinced that in the end of City of Bones, that \\"thing\\" didn't happen and then in the end of this, I was STILL convinced it didn't happen. I'm just in denial about it.<br /><br />I bet Cassie likes trolling us. Almost every single book, there's a cliffhanger! She's like \\"Yes, yes, that's the ending and you have to wait a year or so to read the next book.\\"<br /><br />Overall, this wasn't my favorite book in the series BUT, I still very enjoyed it and I recommend all of you to read this series. You don't want to miss this. This will be the next big thing. Trust me.<br /><br />More of my reviews:[...]
B004ZMWUCU|5.0|I absolutely loved this book. I will recommend it to my faithful friends who all beg me for book recommendations. I found it to be poignant and beautiful.
1416914307|5.0|Wow. Just wow. Omg the ending! This is gonna be so hard for me to write without any spoilers. I'm just gonna write a non spoilers and spoilers part.<br /><br />Throughout this whole entire book... I tried so hard not to throw it out the window. (For all y'all who read it you know what I mean) The Mortal Instruments is one of my favorite series that EVER invented. Cassandra Clare is an amazing writer. Yeah some parts of the novel dragged but then BOOM! It hits the ground running.<br /><br />Again, this is so hard to review without spoilers so... Please pick up this book and if you haven't already read City of Bones, GO READ IT!! You won't regret it.<br /><br />NOW FOR THE SPOILERS:<br />Warning, it might be a little ranty<br /><br />FINALLY! FINALLY THEY KNOW THE TRUTH!! I was so happy when Clary and Jace realize that they weren't brothers and sisters. It took two books and I was literally going insane like yelling at the book and saying they weren't siblings. I almost threw this out the window and I actually started banging this on my table because I was so frustrated.<br /><br />So it starts out with Clary getting ready to go to Alicante with Jace -still thinking they are siblings. Jace tricks Clary into staying for her safety but it backfires. Then we see Jace flirting with Aline who is \\"Sebastian Verlac's\\" cousin. Then more characters come in like Luke's sister Amatis. And Simon ends up in jail....again.<br /><br />In the end, Valentine shows up, Jocelyn's awake and apparently with Luke, and s*** starts to go down.<br /><br />We have a war with Valentine and Shadowhunters and Downworlders are helping each other -which I thought was really cute after all these time hating on each other. During that, Jace and Sebastian are fighting and Jace then realize that Clary isn't his sister and Sebastian/Jonathan is. Then the fight with Valentine, he dies and Jace dies. Angel comes and saves Jace and THE END.<br /><br />Secrets are revealed, and full of non stop drama and action packed scenes unravels. Can't wait to read/reread City of Fallen Angels.<br /><br />(My book blog:[...])n Angels.    (My book blog:[...])
B008Y7N7JW|5.0|must watch this movie! We can't wait for the next film in this franchise!! We've seen it three times and keep jumping at the same parts!
1250007208|5.0|An Amazing New Twist on a Classic!<br /><br />Cyborg Cinderella. I think that it was the concept of an altered twist on the Cinderella tale that really made me yearn for this release as much as I did, and Marissa Meyer fulfilled all of my fantasy dreams. Castle on Earth, yes! How about a evil empire on the Moon that is hellbent on taking over ruling Earth by offing a huge portion of the population so evil Queen can marry hot prince who is crushing on said cyborg Cinderella?! OH yeah!<br /><br />Cinder is a story about a girl named Cinder who lives with the evil stepmother in New Beijing surviving by hiding out in her workshop and selling parts and repairs in the city market. We open up to Cinder revealing that she is a cyborg, part human-part machine, living in a futuristic world that wants nothing to do with cyborgs and yet they are also looking to sell off a cyborg to two into research for a cure to end a crippling disease rippling through the population. Cinder is soon asked to repair a service machine to the one and only horribly attractive, conflicted and kind Prince Kai.<br /><br />Is this book just about a relationship, nope, it is about the harsh reality of interplanetary conflict, death and disease, machine repair, medical practices, and personal leg repair. The character interactions between Kai and Cinder are fabulously written and intertwined in the plot throughout the story but really what caught me was Cinder. This amazing young woman lives a harsh life but also she carries within her a spark to greatness. We soon find in these pages a complicated past and a harrowing future for this young heroine in a world out to shun her. Marissa Meyer has taken an old tale and fashioned it into a new beautiful work that will captivate readers and keep them anticipating until the very last page.<br /><br />Book YA Reviews [...]
B00AZNEW5G|5.0|Fabulous, thoughtful and as vindicating as hell! This movie was extremely well directed and a powerhouse. Had to own this one!!
0307463745|3.0|Really quick read with some great points. I give it 3 because it's not work of genius but if you're into business stuff, this could be useful.
B005DJREJS|4.0|I started Watching when it first came out, not the typical MTV series..really enjoyed it and I've been watching ever since
B00CEIGYAG|5.0|They will revive our stagnant music scene. They represent perfection, but are connecting with the roots of who we are, the groove :) I can't imagine having their whole album, but this little chunk is fine for now!
B00BHHIWQO|5.0|Great game playing with family member miles away..Lots of fun hope my account doesn't. run short of cash before I can catch up with her....
B008AK8FHM|2.0|Interesting reading but no way to prove the experience, It seemed real to rhe author<br /> but so do some dreams appear real after we experience them.
B0052UZIFA|5.0|I'm not telling anyone anything groundbreaking here, but plants vs. zombies is incredible. I'm playing through the main story mode for what i think is the twentieth time. Don't hesitate, buy this game, you won't regret it.
B00899F0G8|3.0|This show is okay to watch when nothing else is on TV, but DAMN ! we are in the third season now and they are STILL are looking for this &#34;A&#34; character. Its REDICULOUS! I'm tired of seeing the same ole same ole and three seasons the plot has not changed and makes the writer looks like he cant find them anything else to get into. This is one series that is dragging out and its becoming Boring and draining. Please find something else to talk about. Please find a new problem for us to figure out. I am at the point right now where I could care less about this series. The affair with the dad and student was a good one, hot teacher, jazzy dressing student good one, finding out the guy next door is your half brother good one. Three seasons of the exact same thing... ABSOLUTE horrible !
B005EHILV4|4.0|I purchased this 302USB a month and a half ago, and though I haven't explored its full potential yet, I'll review what I know so far.<br /><br />Pros:<br /><br />Quick, easy, automatic driver install.<br />Works great with Audacity.<br />Simple Windows audio device setup.  One Input device, One Output device. They're both named \\"USB Audio CODEC\\".<br />Predictable, dependable audio.<br />XLR-1/4in combo jack allows all sorts of audio devices.<br />USB out/in selection great for recording FROM computer as well.<br /><br />Cons:<br /><br />Seems to demand too much power from certain USB ports.  Couldn't use it on my laptop's USB ports or my desktop HTPC's front ports without a powered hub(well, I could use it, but the levels were so low it wasn't worth it).  Not sure what the voltage standard is for USB, but this thing seems to demand the highest voltage, whatever that may be.<br /><br />Overall, if you're like me, looking to record random instrumental samples and mess around, then go for it.  It does what it advertises, it's high quality, and it looks darn purty.  I have it paired with a Sennheiser E609 and so far have had great results.<br /><br />However, I'm sure there are better alternatives in the $100-300 range that do all this, plus don't have the USB power issue.  For the price though, friggin' bruce.
1451662432|3.0|It's a book ! The book arrived in good condition. The book has details of his life and the way it is written you can tell that Arnold was involved a lot in the writing versus being a narrative. He peaks a lot about hi workout days, and how it was for him being from another country and coming to America. Good book if your Arnold fan or if your in an airport and have time to burn and just want to read a book. The book is big and bulky, but its ok it can fit in your laptop bag.
098357670X|5.0|I love this book and am very happy I ordered it, it was well worth the price I paid for it.
B009LH1Y1W|5.0|I love this show, this is my favorite show. After the show air, they could put it online a little faster but it is a very good show and I love it. I have the complete 6, 7 and 8th season through amazon prime and I can catch it anywhere and anytime I please long as I have an internet connection. What I do not like is, I have paid for the show yet the only place I can watch it is on amazon.com. That needs to change or someone need to come out with a website where if I pay for a series of TV shows, movie or whatever. I am able to watch it without being connected to the internet. where I am able to download it to my desktop and watch when ever.
B008HT4FUW|5.0|I think this is the best series I've ever watched, couldn't wait to see every episode when it was on PBS.  It was so wonderful I just had to order the series so my family can rewatch it anytime we like.
0062238868|5.0|What Chris did for his country is so above and beyond.  Book explains in plain language what had brought him to his fame.  Chris is pretty humble.
B00012QM8G|5.0|This movie seems more like a documentary than a movie, because it tells the story of Mr. Schindler, a German with a heart, and a war profiteer.
B000TEUCFA|5.0|Not only does Stacey sing like non other (the best), but her sister was my best friend when we were in grade school.<br />Buy anything you can find by Stacey Kent. Her music touches your soul.
B000P0J0EW|5.0|The Shawshank Redemption is I believe still one of the most popular movies on the top 10 list. Well worth seeing.
B0054JZC6E|5.0|this game is so much freaking fun! I love when I can finally unlock a new mini game to play.
0783225733|4.0|If you've ever wondered what really happened on the Apollo 13 moon mission, then this movie will show you. It is good to know what these Astronauts went through trying to get back home after an explosion caused them to abort their moon landing.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|I just love this app it is great and it is really fun for all genders boy or girl love
B0031RSBU0|5.0|An excellent book, displaying once again, how Mankell can develop stories with complicated plots from obscure parts of the world.
B00BEZTMQ8|5.0|I loved this movie! Arrived quickly in perfect condition! Definitely a must have! Although, I was a bit disappointed that they haven't released an extended edition yet. So if I was you I would wait until the extended edition is available and then get this epic movie:)
B008ASGP3U|5.0|Another mystery with John Rebus. What more could you want? Rankin has brought Rebus out of retirement...thank goodness. This novel is extremely well-crafted and ranks with the best of this lengthy series.
B00AIUUXHC|5.0|I love this game. its addicting. its also fun to play in school when your bored. the only problem ive had is the game has frozen once. otherwise I love it
B00B999E12|5.0|this order came fast just 2 days this movie was great  the music is even greater this has almost every song on the film  some of the tracks  have opera themes but very emotional the high light song is snow angel the piano track for the film this music is definitely  good for those who need emotion when writing a  novel of there own or to read a novel like paradise lost.
B0093H8HXS|5.0|100% advisable, good packaging.<br />The product is received without any fault, perfect performance.<br />That packaging is more compact, reliable, safe.
0062502174|5.0|Everyone should have read this.<br />It helps you to get a clear vision on the purpose of your life and look for your happyness in your surrounding world and within.<br />It gives you a boost to start applying its theories in your own life.<br />Many thanks to the author. I loved it and am sure to read it at least one more time but then with pencil and paper ...
B0083P1QUM|5.0|Once again Patricia Cornwell has written another winner!!<br />I have read every one of her books and have never been disappointed.
B00BHMETKC|5.0|Nice little side story to the Iraq Hostage Headline well told. Kudos for Affleck balancing directing and acting and keeping us in suspense despite knowing the outcome.
B002APU580|5.0|This is one of those classic love stories that you just can't stop watching, over, and over.  You get a true feel for this historical period, without the Hollywood glitter and glamor we so often see. One of my favorite movies.
0439023513|5.0|The one thing I did not like about Mockingjay was the end. I won't spoil it but I just want to say that I don't think Collins did justice to the characters. It could have easily been extended into a 4th book, so why go the direction that it went? Still, it is a 5-star series IMO, so I won't rate it below a 5.
B000NI8F5G|5.0|While the heyday of the musical is long past, this film combines all of the elements of great movie making into a near perfect picture.  Whether you appreciate the historical turn of silents into talkies, the irreverent Hollywood insider's view of &#34;how thing work in the studio system&#34;, the innovative and gymnastic choreography, or, yes, the iconic music, there is something here for everyone.  Gene Kelly showed an uncanny genius and a unique level of dedication to his craft in what he accomplished with this great American Classic.  A must see, regardless of whether you are a casual filmgoer or a film buff.
0439023491|5.0|Books 1 & 2 are the best of the series, in my opinion. Catching Fire has wonderful twists and kept me very engaged, even though I actually have a lot of difficulty engaging with books, even if they are YA level. Can't wait for the movie and glad I didn't hear about the books until all 3 were out, so I could just devour them!
B002RI9L76|5.0|I read it as a child and reading it now really opened my eyes of how great this book is :D
B005R4HUZM|5.0|Say what you will about the French, their culture is second to none. Writers such as Baudelaire, Flaubert, and, yes, Stendhal were each in his own way decades ahead of their time, writing works which were both the first and the best of their kind. This Kindle edition appears (I'm almost halfway) very well-edited and error-free. It's intriguing, suspenseful, entertaining and highly literary at the same time. Penetrating psychological insight is combined with an exquisite style, sometimes humorous, sometimes poetic, but always apposite. A true masterpiece, which I can't wait to finish.
B009UX2YAC|3.0|I love this game!!!!!  Every time I play it its so fun... but I keep telling myself that I'll do something else with my life but I keep coming back to play it becuz its so looping addictive!!!!!  The three stars are because sometimes it has glitches
B00BF11STU|3.0|It's an important movie to watch so that we understand more of the threats we have to deal with. As a movie just average
B00BGIC4I6|1.0|Just like all the others.  I thought it was boring.  I would like to see Paul Rudd in something good as I consider him a good actor.  After seeing this maybe I am wrong about him.
0345529057|5.0|the series of books is really  good. The package and covers look so nice. I love them very very much.
B000QCS8TW|5.0|The book is great. I started watching the series before reading the book to get my fix until season 3 came out. At first I didn't even know the show was based off of some books. The shows follows the books very closely which is nice. I am a fan of walking dead and it doesn't really follow the comic.<br />Looking forward to reading the rest of the books in the series!
B004UHL9EK|5.0|It requires phone abilities is because there is a feature on the app that makes it possible to alert you while in a phone call or not. It also has plenty of other features including a talk to you future.
B009IEXKXI|5.0|Gripping, amazing, loved it! Lost hours of sleep and my productivity suffered because I couldn't put this book down. Totally worth it.
B001AQQR2S|5.0|I absolutely love this movie no matter how many times I watch it! It's fun and magical and revengeful and its so sweet. And the fact that's its on Amazon prime instant watch is frickin awesome!!!
B000W93CHC|5.0|Read this right after finishing Pillars of the Earth.  I highly recommend this book, but if you have not read Pillars, read it first.  Historical fiction at its best.
B00BF11STU|4.0|We know the ending, but you are still excited about watching the outcome. The movie allows the viewer to understand the process that the FBI, CIA and others must endure to track and locate a terrorist. Enjoyed every moment, makes me glad to be in America.
B007VUA7VO|5.0|This is a great app, I use it a lot to work out how  long  my kindle will take to charge or if I have enough battery to watch a film.I highly recommend it.
B009XHAM8G|5.0|This book gets 5 stars because it will bring up emotions of every person that reads it. It is a wonderful to read long with your child.
B007ZYABW6|1.0|This not a true story and I think it is shameful that monny is being made off this lie.  If you plan to walk across the Godi Desert with out water it will be best for you to find better survival skills than you will find in this book.
B004EPZ06G|5.0|A fun movie, just as crazy as the first one. Not sure I dig having every dvd come with an Ultra Violet Digital Copy, but oh well.
B002KEZ96Y|2.0|Yes, the Dude and all.  I love Jeff Bridges and I like Zen stoners but maybe I just grew out of it.<br /><br />Anyway, I watched enough to &#34;get&#34; the occasional references to this apparently iconic movie but just couldn't stay with it after two attempts.  Bye Dude, moving on here.
B003Y5H574|5.0|Love this movie. Great plot, and great acting. I really love the soundtrack, and the overall sentiment of this film.
B0057KXXFM|4.0|Just wanted something fun to listen to, and in my opinion that's is what limp is about. Fred durst writes about the same crap he always has but the band sounds better.
B004LWZW7Y|5.0|My son adores this movie. This is his second copy, because he exhausts the playback features on the last DVD. He even does the cat dance performance. meow!
B00BGIBVP8|2.0|I really hate to say this but after seeing Apatow's two new films, I keep thinking that what Danielle Steel is to upper class east coasts elites, Apatow is with wealthy west coast hollywood. I can't blame the guy for writing and making what he knows, but his (directed) comedies are really starting to feel far removed from everyday reality. Yes, there are some universal elements to what it is like getting older in a first world society, but it is through a prism of a small minority. If movies are mixed tapes, this could have said a lot more with a lot less.
B00AREIAI8|4.0|This is a very fun, easy , and interesting game that me and my sister's have found to be very entertaining.
1780721676|5.0|Did the fast for 5 consecutive days and lost 10 lbs. Wasn't as hard as I thought it would be. I did drink a lot more water than usual about 64 ounces a day plus 2 coffee's & 2 hot green teas.
B007TBZ63Y|5.0|This book is just amazing!!!!! I started all the way from Percy Jackson and the Olympians and now I'm here. In the books everything ties together! I love it. I loved learning new things about roman gods and mythology. 12 years old now-20 years then and I'll still be reading these books. Words can't describe how amazing Rick Riordan created this lovely series. once you start reading you get sucked in the mystery, romance, and suspense.
B0063GORYU|5.0|I love Spider.  It tests my ability to move the cards in such a way so that I can Win.  The hints are wonderful,
B005GFPZYK|4.0|Insightful book into the heroic mind of our military personnel.  The book makes you feel like you're in the battle with him although in the safety of the good ol' USA.
B0063IH60K|5.0|The hints are wonderful.  I am improving and can win many of the Random deals.  It's an old standby, but I really enjoy it.
B00AQ71FLK|5.0|I've bee told this is a bad game wand you know what all the people that told me that h saga 're angry birds and temple run and even halo so don't listen to the get this app and I promise that you will love it
B007TNQ7EY|5.0|played it while I was on my plane to pass time thinking it wouldn't be that good and boy was I wrong! this game is amazing!
0765365278|5.0|This book is one of the best fantasy novels ever written and is an absolute must-read. I strongly recommend it
B009U9S6FI|5.0|Must read for those interested in psychology, or just wanting to consider how they're living and why.  Great book for taking perspective.
B00B1E6FF8|5.0|This turned out to be a fantastic movie. You are able to see the whole story of the hunt for Osama bin Lasen. The lead hunter Maya(played by Jessica Chastain) makes it her life pursuit to catch Osama bin Laden.They have a clue only to have it dissapear. The search for bin Laden is bordered in<br />Pakistan and Afghanistan.Maya escapes several assassination attempts and bombings in her pursuit if bin Laden.After running into several dead ends they<br />finally find his location. Next they have to ge tapproval from the President to move on the target. After finally getting approcal American Navy Seals<br />fly in to kill Osama bin Laden. This is a good up close look at the actual capture of the most wanted man alive Osama bin Laden. This is a very good movie<br />do not miss it.
B000I62JAK|5.0|This movie is one of my favorite comedies, it always puts me in a great mood after watching it, classic Ben Stiller.
B005Q1W10A|5.0|The characters are so well developed that one can't but be fascinated with this glimpse into war time WWI. The acting makes you either love or hate the characters. Very well done!
B007SGLZP8|5.0|It was a very interesting story well developed and kept you guessing until the end. I think it was one of the more memorable Grisham novels.
142313866X|4.0|As others have said, the pictures and content are great, but this book deserves better binding, it's very flimsy and means it has to be handled gently for fear of it falling apart.  But overall it's a wonderful book!
B005GFPZYK|3.0|This book was OK, but not rivetting. attention to detail was good but a little too much personal opion for my liking. I believe that if you nothing nice too say, sometimes your better off saying nothing at all.
B00C0NFMKI|5.0|Simply Put.. i love paramore. Here I am just typing enough to be able to post this review. Ok? bye.

B004GHNIRK|5.0|One of those movies that grips you from beginning to end.  Javier should have been a singer not an actor (Russell Crow) could use some singing lessons, but everyone else in the movie sang beautifully.
B003O86MY8|4.0|Found him through Pandora. Loved it, plan to get more of his music. A great talent worth listening to anytime.

B0064MGU98|5.0|I had never heard of this series until I saw my partner watching an episode about a week ago.  It took about 5 minutes for me to become a fan.  I immediately set about trying to figure out a way I could start watching the show from the first episode of the first season and discovered that Prime customers of Amazon can have one month's streaming free of charge.  I'm now viewing season two and I'm pleased to report that I'm still mesmerized by the creativity of the writers on The Good Wife.  Each episode has its own identity and proves to me that I'm not as smart as I think I am.  The episode that still has me in awe is the one in which Will finds himself doing battle with an intractable military court system.  I imagine that it is extremely unlikely that this scenario (i.e. a civilian lawyer defending a soldier in a military court) would ever take place...but it sure made for high drama and I think I heard Rodney King in the background whispering, &#34;Can we all just get along?&#34;  The gradual process of turning mutual disdain into a grudging respect for the cleverness of the opposing side and finally, as is true with any powerful love story, the opponents become true admirers.  I gotta see this episode again, but I'm going to wait until I finish all of season two.
B009GEDP26|5.0|It's truly one of the best, most enjoyable shows on television! Never miss it! Saving on my DVR till it's realeased on DVD/AmazonPrime :)
B007REV4T8|5.0|Skyfall is a movie filled with a lot of action. I would definitely watch this movie over and over again.
B006Y5EDRG|5.0|I love this show! The music is amazing! The leading ladies are so much fun to watch! Katherine McPhee's &#34;Don't Forget Me&#34; in the finale, is something you'll never be able to forget (loved it)! Buy the soundtrack too! so much fun!
B0099114WO|5.0|This was a very funny movie. Meryl and Tommy  were great together. We laughed all the way through the movie.
B00B69UQJY|5.0|Excellent album, merging Blues and gospel w/ steamy electronics; Dave's sultry baritone brings this album full circle. Not since Songs of Faith & Devotion and Violator has DM sounded so good!
B009AMANBA|4.0|This movie was good. The movie was entertaining, but sometimes a little slow in moving along. It is a movie I would watch but not over and over

B002MQYOFW|4.0|The reason for reading this is comes from my nine year old granddaughter. I was skeptical at first, however I enjoyed it. Can,t wait to read the next book.

1892005034|5.0|This is an incredibly powerful piece of work, which, if attended to with diligence, can and will change the quality of one's life and one's relationships in a profound way. The concept is simple, insightful, but not always easy to apply - hence practice.<br /><br />To hear the sound of another's voice, which consists of not just words but more importantly the feelings and the associated needs, requires that the listener be completely present and empathic. This is neither easy nor always available to us in today's hectic life style. However, it is worth our time and practice to stay the course.<br /><br />Techniques and concepts described in this book (listen, paraphrase, ask, understand needs versus feelings etc) are simple and powerful and highly recommended.<br /><br />One practice that the book does not quite touch upon, which would help the reader enormously in tapping into these concepts is that of meditation. Meditation brings about self awareness, which in turn increases our awareness of emotional states of another, allowing us to relate with greater empathy.<br /><br />If you are serious about understanding and being understood, this is your book. If you are looking for a superficial fix to your deeper problems, even then give this a chance to surprise you.
0385349947|5.0|I think this is a book that everyone can relate and to start thinking outside the 'norm' and comfort zone. she's one of my new hero. Amazing, exceptional and dynamic woman! Great clear speaker... Not to mention addicting down to earth speeches that keep you searching for more of her speeches! I'm so at awe with her tremendous ability to attempt to move woman forward. What an inspiration! I would love to have her run for Presidency. I hope she choose that path and lead the entire nation to a new revolution of woman in power! What an awesome ideal to ponder!! The new generations of my 3 girls will definitely hear this many more times so they will be very clear and aware of the 'real' life situation out there as they strive to achieve their dreams. Most importantly, I certainly wish I had this wealth of information when I was in my 20's. I believe my life would take a different turn!!
B00005V9IL|5.0|I received an advance copy of this set and it's spectacular and is reasons.  I can tell you having only gotten to see a few episodes of the series total that the show itself is  entertaining.

B004UHL9EK|5.0|A lot, apparently - more than I ever would have guessed.<br /><br />First of all I tried this on my 1st gen Kindle Fire and have yet to have a problem. Some features like vibration are obviously not going to work, and you have to remember that for an alarm to go off, you need to put the Fire to sleep, rather than powering it off.<br /><br />So, feature-wise, the first thing you see is basically an unlimited number of timers you can set up and operate simultaneously. Unlike a simple timer where you'd just set the duration every time you start the app, here your timers are remembered, so if you have a regular event you need to time, your setup work is minimized. This might be useful for a teacher, for example.<br /><br />For each timer you have saved you can choose an icon and a descriptive title, and set the usual features such as whether to vibrate and what sound to play. You can also have the timer repeat automatically at a specified interval. There's a mysterious trigger function I haven't been able to determine the use of, yet. There's a quick-set button that lets you quickly create and start a timer with a handful of common times, but I wish it would be removed from your  list of timers after you stop it (at least, optionally).<br /><br />The timer has a snooze function; when a timer is going off you can have it pause its alarm for a predefined amount of time. I can see this being useful. Sometimes I have a timer going off and can't deal with it right then and need another reminder in a few minutes.<br /><br />The app also sports an alarm clock mode. Here the features are in line with what you'd expect from a competent alarm clock: you can set multiple alarms to repeat on specific days (or not repeat), choose ringtones and vibration for each, display different icons and names for them, and toggle them on and off without losing their settings.<br /><br />Finally there is a stopwatch mode with the usual lap functionality. Oddly here though, you can only run one stopwatch at a time.  Multiple stopwatches (while perhaps more difficult to operate than a single one!) seem more useful to me than multiple timers.<br /><br />Other options include different fonts for the numbers, many different settings for the alarm clock such as alarm duration, vibrate pattern, sound fade in, snooze setting and more (interestingly, limited options for stopping the alarm such as flipping the device over or pushing a volume button); options regarding using the status bar; whether or not to automatically start at boot (to make the alarm clock function useful), and even a cloud backup and restore function for your settings.<br /><br />Rotating the device brings up a larger display of one of your active timers (seems to be the one that is going to expire soonest).<br /><br />The last use/activation time is shown for your timers and alarms and maintained in a log. Again, not sure how this is useful but it is there.<br /><br />So now we get to some of the weirdness.<br /><br />There's a little inconsistency in the user interface. In the timer screen, the device's menu button brings up a menu with preferences, filter, exit, help (the help being very minimal), restart all, and delete all. In the alarm clock or stopwatch mode, however, the menu button does nothing, and instead you have access to a settings button in the upper right of the screen, to get to the preferences, which is not there at all in the timer screen. To get the other options from the main menu you have to go back to the timer screen.<br /><br />In timer mode there is no quick way to stop/reset a timer. You have to touch the line for the timer and then choose your operation from a menu. It would make sense to me to have a start/stop/pause button always displayed for each timer, so only one press is needed to do the most likely operation.<br /><br />In stopwatch mode there is a mysterious floppy disk icon. I think all that does is save the time displayed as a timer on the timer screen. Whatthis could be useful for I'm not sure.<br /><br />Also in timer mode is the mysterious trigger function. The help does not describe it and its functionality is not obvious. WHen I tried it, it just kept re-alarming every few seconds after it went off and it was difficult to make it stop.<br /><br />The controls to set times are a little weird. In one mode they are very short (vertically) \\"dial\\" like controls (similar to normal android number chooser wheels) which are kind of inconvenient. In another mode they take up the whole screen which makes them easier to set although it looks excessive and silly. Functional in either case, just inconsistent.<br /><br />With those little oddities out of the way however this seems like quite a useful timer app, especially if you need a number of pre-set timers on a regular basis.

B0088EDMMS|5.0|how can you not love this movie. The quality on blu-ray is so different from the dvd its really worth buying, so do it. buy it now!
B005K17RU0|2.0|Too many things began popping up and I deleted it. It blasted out a warning right in the middle of dinner. Scared everyone. I could not figure how to lower or cut the volume out.
B0094BB4TW|1.0|Facebook app on kindle fire hd. It keeps giving me a network error even though im  on my own wifi with great signal. I tried removing and reinstalling but still got the same networking error. Facebook stop changing your code on a daily basis and finally make things work. Why make people frustrated?? Facebook you suck and anyone else responsible for keeping the apps running correctly on these devices.
B00005Q4CS|5.0|This is an extremely difficult movie to watch but it is important to watch, for any age group. For anyone wishing to escape their lives and sink into drug abuse, it aptly portrays the downhill slide. The hallucinations, shootings, amputations, prostitution are all very realistic. It is both sad but also uplifting in that we can all learn from this.let us hope this can help prevent people from destroying their lives.
B002WV5A9G|5.0|Loved to see the &#34;prequels&#34; to the Star Trek movies and can't wait to see the new one coming out in May
B00AF6MF9I|5.0|Gameloft has really outdone themselves on this game, I just wish that you can also play without Wi-Fi because I hardly ever get it.
B0071XO8RA|5.0|I recommend this book to anyone looking for a fun sci-fi fantasy book.  Might especially jump out to those who have played the fallout game series. Once I started reading, I couldn't stop.  I'm hoping for a t.v. series on this book sometime!
0738711500|5.0|Very easy to follow and Ms.Ellershaw seems to know what you want to do next but tells you what you should do, to become familiar with the deck and how to properly use it.  The deck is beautifully done.
B0099Y2MYK|5.0|Great series. Only thing wrong is season 4 is not out yet and we have to wait till the end of the year.
086571701X|5.0|This book has all the information I was looking for to start a home aquaponics system.  It covers everything from the build of the system to the spec on what you will need to care for the fish and plants, plus a few of the authors tips on making it work better than most systems.  Great book also to use as a reference to know what plants work best and how to keep the water perfect for both the fish and the plants
B00BHHIWQO|5.0|What a fun game. Make sure to try it out.  Great way to kill time.  Challenges the mind.  Can play for hours.
B0064MPXFA|5.0|Julianne Margolies, is the right person for this role and portrays the good wife in a very believeable character!  The scenerios played out in each legal episode is mindboggling!  Constant technical maneuvering legal/illegal surprises, who is investigating who, not knowing who to trust and more  . . .  is a major suspense to each episode!  This series will make you laugh with amazement and also touch you at certain moments!  Very moving and entertaining!  Highly recommended!
B00992CF6W|5.0|This is my only version of minecraft I can't afford the real one but other than that I love it
B00BEPVAV8|4.0|Good game. I wish there wasn't a time limit. Also better control and getting to choose different tracks would be good.
B00AFEXRME|5.0|Denzel Washington oozes charisma in this movie. And the female lead (newer so can't remember her name) does a great job in this movie. She is very beautiful in a down to earth but sort of exotic way at the same time. I am in recovery. There are many things that happen in this movie that &#34;normies&#34; might feel are far fetched but those of us who have more than dabbled with drugs and/or alcohol can totally relate to the characters in this movie. The ending is something I didn't even see coming. This movie has great messages. It is too bad that many people will likely not understand the significance of those messages.Regardless, I highly recommend this movie to everyone. If you know someone in recovery, watch it with them to hear their perspective.
B0084AZXKK|5.0|This is an old story but I had forgotten many of the details of the story.  It could be that all I knew was from the movies.  I enjoyed the read.
B0087GF8ZG|3.0|It's good for a small closet, the battery goes down pretty fast. Won't buy it again. I won't put it in the hallway. I would use Beams.
B007J4T2G8|5.0|I couldn't put it down. This is one of the most amazing book series I've ever read. I love this series
B00BF11STU|5.0|It's already been done. Just watch it. You won't be disappointed. Very intense, and gives you a greater appreciation of our intel community. The one thing I was afraid the movie would do was that it would give Obama to much props. It did no such thing. In fact, it showed what it took to finally track down UBL, many things the current president was totally against doing.
B007IXWKUK|5.0|If you liked book 1 you'll love book 2 the plot thickens in the second book that makes you anticipate the third book
B002M87W2W|4.0|This musical is fun, sounds great, bright colors, and entertains my 8 year old thoroughly. I find it fun too.

B00AAQHP66|5.0|After a visit to Kauai' this winter and watching the surfers for hours on end, we just had to have this movie.  We missed seeing it in the theaters.  Glad that I purchased it.  have watched it twice and loaned it out once already.

B000OIZSVY|5.0|This book was actually really fun to read.  Yes, the author tends to use some big words and makes some pretentious statements, but it was extremely entertaining!  I loved every page of this book, learned quite a bit of history of punctuation marks, etc.<br /><br />Yes, this book is aimed at a British audience, so some of the jokes, grammar, etc. was aimed in that direction; but I loved it.
B004LWZW8S|5.0|ENJOYED MOVIE REALLY GOOD.IT HAD A  GOOD LINE AND GREAT ACTORS WHICH MADE THE MOVIE MORE ENJOYABLE.I RECAMEND IT TO ANYONE.
B00992CF6W|5.0|I wish that it would connect to other  world better. But it is a great game. So yea thank you for listening
6305841861|5.0|I know that sounds funny but it is true. I brought this set as a gift and a came in before the date listed. Imagine my shock a company that keeps there word. Anyway, the movies were of a very high quality and boxed perfectly. I give this company 2 thumbs up. God bless!<br /><br />K.M.

B00701897I|5.0|It was out standing I would recommend young and old to watch. I first saw this at the movies.when I got my 3d tv  and blue ray I had to get this movie so my grands could watch.
0385536828|5.0|An excellent new novel from Ian McEwan. He very easily transports you back to the bleakness of 1970's era Britain and tells an interesting story about a girl recruited to be a spy. My favorite parts of the book were actually the sections where he was summarizing the works of the writer in the story. So you had these little interesting stories within the story. As a writer myself, I can truly appreciated the challenge of coming up with so many stories at once. The protagonist is an interesting character who's sexiness oozes of the pages and you can easily see why the author falls under her spell. It does at times move rather slowly, but this book is like a fine wine, where every word and clever turn of phrase is meant to be savored. The end is fantastic - and very clever - perhaps to clever for it's own good but it was at least satisfying and by no means bleak as novels like this tend to be. McEwan continues to show that he can be both a literary writer and good storyteller without compromising both.
B001F63D66|5.0|Great, hilarious, sexy, and clever I absolutely love this movie.At first I was unsure, but as the minutes started to go by the better the movie got. Definitely want to watch it again and again. Not the best to watch with kids around.
B000LXHK2C|5.0|It is seldom that I like to watch a movie repeatedly - not this one.  I have watched it several times and it always entertains.  There must be something about growing grapes, making wine and living in France.  I love the plot, the characters, the romance and the ending - entertainment without being 'heavy'.  Well done throughout.  A personal favorite.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|The game is very enjoyable with fun aspects a wide range of boards and character's. The fact you can connect to face book is great to.
B008220C56|4.0|Wow so many bad reviews, all because the movie was set as a play within a play. I loved the movie. It was arty, with beautiful photography & a great story. Perhaps I am not like most people, but I don't see any reason to keep making new versions of movies, much less watch them, if they are clones of the previous versions. What monotony! You need a new twist & this version with scenes played out on stage worked for me. I especially loved when a meadow is shown in the theater, among the seats. That's inventive. I rented the movie first & loved it so much I am now here to buy it.
B00AQ3K8IU|4.0|Nice romantic story that isl predictable but you still want to keep reading it. Would suit any age group.  Enjoy
B005D9MUWY|5.0|best keyboard app ever! highly recommended. definitely worth buying.<br />I used to have a blackberry Torch and thought I could not live without a physical keyboard on my smartphone but thanks to SwiftKey I have been set free.
B007FEZQF8|5.0|I really wish I had read the comics before seeing the show. Reading them now is a fix while the tv series is on hiatus.
B004UJAOLM|4.0|A very good book. One book that is not so easily forgotten. A timeless classic. Characters and story flow seamlessly right to the end. Ending was a little lacking .
B004SBQGHS|3.0|What a game I can not put it down. Every minute I get I'm playing this game.One glitch I have found is I try and purchase the Eagle and never receive it but also states that I had already purchased this item. Does the same when trying to purchase extras. Maybe that's why it takes me so long but it keeps me occupied.
B00C7KYXHW|5.0|I know that this is a ripoff of the movie, but as long as the writers stay on point, I see this as a very exciting thriller of a series. My imagination goes wild with all the possible plot twist and turns. This could make for amazing Television.

1455523550|3.0|This is the first Nicholas Sparks book I've read and probably the last.  The book started out good and then right in the middle the author started saying the same thing over and over and over.  That got boring very fast.  I was disappointed at the plot twist at the end.  Jo wasn't really there.  Why not?  Katie needed a real friend.  Did all of them recover from everything that happened just like that?  This book just wasn't that good.
B001ANSSDC|5.0|Liked these characters and was &#34;rooting&#34; for them and their happiness.  Characters very quirky, which kept me guessing.  Enjoyable, nice writing.  Now want to see the movie to compare to author's vision.
B00CEIGYAG|5.0|Great great song. Makes you wanna dance or drive with the top down. Having Pharell on the track was geniua.Daft Punk has won me over again as always.  They never disappoint me.
B000JMKTLO|4.0|I liked this novel, but was almost &#34;spooked&#34; by it for several days after, just couldn't get it out of my mind.  Very disturbed and flawed characters.  I'd read it because I like Flynn's writing style, having just read Gone Girls.  This is not for anyone who may be weak emotionally.
B00B1E6FF8|2.0|The real story is the accomplishment of the men actually on the raid, not the office workers.  They risked everything to put this monster out of business and deserve more.

B007VUCAVO|5.0|This is a great app that does exactly what it says it will do.  It takes the guess work out of charging and using my Kindle Fire.
B00AF6MF9I|5.0|awesome game that includes fighting with virtual real military men from the US and were u can build your own base
B005S9EKCW|4.0|But still, an enjoyable movie. Yes, Russell Crowe is not as strong a singer as some of the cast, but still his acting was good. Only quibble with the movie is too many close-ups. This is a story on a grand scale, not close-ups of people singing. I thought HBC and SBC were mis-cast as the innkeepers. I think my issues with the movie revolve around the director and his choices.
B00B6QXN56|5.0|This is the album I've been waiting for from Joe.  His electric albums are superb, but this one brings down the house.  With a set of ideal musicians helping out, he combines his own stylistic licks to a combination of folk, jazz, and blues.
B004UHL9EK|5.0|I've purchased many apps and mostly only been able to keep track of 2 times. This app gives you multiple time keeping options that. I'm a online gamer and I need a timer to remind me when I need to be back to check my games, or other online gamers will steal my game profits. And the alarm options are awesome! You can use this for timers, alarms,  stopwatch.  Yea sure there's no widget but that's no problem. Put the icon on your home screen. Get this app. You'll find a use for it.
B00AREIAI8|4.0|It kept me busy and I liked it<br />Th I s review was made so that I would receive more jewels
B0034DGPEU|5.0|Heart warming and heart breaking at the same time . One of the best books I have read in a long time
B00C2VIA52|5.0|A great title, i suggest it highly. Gameloft gives us another great order and chaos title. I havent experienced and crashes or bugs, its a nice and solid game. Smmoth grapics, challenging, stragetic card battles and fun gameplay make this a must have for kindle fire owners.
B00CBKLO52|5.0|In this sim, you have many options to choose your controls, and the physics are correct..<br />Your plane will react as an RC should, not like a real  plane.<br />You will notice that there is little weight and inertia.<br />The plane bounces and the engine is stronger in proportion to the mass than that of a real plane.<br />It's a good training exercise so you won't wreck  your first real RC.<br />Too bad you cannot leave the training field because the graphics are gorgeous and make you want to fly farther.
B007IXWL2C|5.0|Everything you didn't know about sex!  Read all three.  Hide it from all who are faint of heart.  Enjoy it!
1250012570|5.0|Eleanor & Park meet on the school bus. She's an outcast, the new girl, flaming red hair and friendless. He's quiet, keeps to himself, and reluctantly scoots over for her to sit down. And the rest is history.<br /><br />Beautifully written, Eleanor & Park is filled with rich and gooey sentences I want to read again and again. Rowell does a fantastic job describing Park's loving but far from perfect family as well as Eleanor's harsh and dangerous home life. These two character's backgrounds are portrayed beautifully, creating a delicate backdrop to this young adult realistic love.<br /><br />Eleanor is picked on, she's bullied, but she hasn't lost hope. She hasn't lost herself. Park doesn't fit in. He's half Korean which both defines him and is the way others see him, but this subject is handled playfully, with care.<br /><br />Complicated yet pure first love stands against the setting of dark and sometimes dangerous times makes Eleanor & Park not unique. But Rowell does such a wonderful job writing about them, it is as if you've never read a story of star crossed lovers. As if you've never read a story about first love. As if you are falling in love for the first time. All over again.<br /><br />And that may be what allows this novel to stand out from the others out there. The beautiful writing, the sharp and witty dialogue, the flawed characters.<br /><br />I see Eleanor on the bus. And Park sitting next to her. Driving away.<br /><br />Can't recommend it enough.
B00BHMF578|4.0|Amazing considering it is based on a true story. Very entertaining as well. Some parts though seemed a little stretch from reality. I don't understand the best picture award. It was good but not that good.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|Once I started reading this, I couldn't stop.  The book held my attention so well I finished it within 48 hours!  I highly recommend this and the other two books in the trilogy.
B009AMANH4|3.0|Too hard to navigate the menu...  No contrast to know where you are making your choice.  Could use a less artful, dark presentation.  I still do not know how I finally found the movie.
1452113432|5.0|excellent and delicious!!!!<br /><br />Ms Khoo is a great chef with an easy flair to cook that makes it very interesting.
B0060MYKTY|5.0|Even more enjoyable than season one, if possible.  The cast ages well and the complicated plot fascinates any history buff.
B00BIRRDZ4|5.0|Great melodic tones and easy listening.  Really great work again by Dawes.  This band just continues to put great songs.
B00684J49U|5.0|I own all of Grey's Anatomy, so of course when the new ones are released, I have to buy them.  I love that show.
B003TSEEDY|5.0|I really enjoyed the movie, but the book tied together many loose ends. It made a lot of my own anxiety slip into Charley's world.
B00A3NQNUU|1.0|Submitted an order for gems and ended up with nothing but a charge on my account. Don't recommend taking the chance as I have received no refund or gems.<br /><br />Interestingly something happened in the app shortly after the review but still no Gems.<br /><br />Device - Kindle Fire HD.
B00CAJMGDI|5.0|I've never been a huge violin fan, but I love this album and artist. There are very very few albums where I love every song, and this one is it! I can't wait for more releases from this talented young lady!
B00BFUUMO8|5.0|Can't believe this game is as good as it is and free!  This game holds my interest and is still easy to keep going without having to spend real money.  If you like sim builder type games, you will enjoy this one.
B000ZMVAXO|5.0|I purchased this for a gift for my son, who plays guitar.  He wanted to play without deafening everyone..<br />This Headphone does the trick..Wonderful product...Fast shipping...very happy with my purchase.
B0082Z447U|5.0|I am not an avid 'reader' but this audible book I could not put down. The orators were amazing.  H..A..M..
B004SIIBGU|4.0|It's a good app and works well. I wish I could do some more stuff with it but it works well whenever I am away from my pc.
B000P0J0AQ|5.0|I Needed the trilogy and Animatrix to teach a class about the philosophical and social implications of these films. These are great DVD copies of these films.
B00B2V66VS|4.0|My son loves the app but I am always hearing him complain about it freezing and once there was a few days in a row that it wouldn't open. It could use an update.
B00AQO1VYY|5.0|This is a great album, the sound quality is great of the live shows. It is worth the price and is a great edition
B002BWP49M|5.0|I love the movie. The whole saga! If you are gonna buy it do it in blu-ray. It's worth it!
B00AREIAI8|5.0|This was the best game I have ever played in my life scene I love horses so much I can play it any time I want
B008JMKN4Y|5.0|What kind I say. I love Travis and Abby I couldnt put the book down. Read the book in 8 hours a record for me. I've read books fast, this one I just could not put down!
0061673730|5.0|..but no one has disagreed that &#34;QUALITY&#34;  is difficult to define objectively but we seem to know it immediately upon encountering it.<br /><br />I'd say that describes my reaction to ZMM.<br /><br />And I am about ready to buy another copy, my third one.<br /><br />Whenever I lose patience, get stuck, my temptation is still to go faster to try force it.  And each time I circle back to  Pirsig's admonishment to stop, slow down to a crawl, walk away, or just breathe.  It has saved me each time from even larger errors.<br /><br />The other day I read where a famous musician said to another who was trying to learn a piece of music but going too fast and stumbling over it.  He said, &#34;The Slower you go the faster you will get there&#34;.<br /><br />I'll bet Pirsig would have been nodding his head vigorously at that.
B00CBRH4YU|1.0|The system is broken. This movie was split into two parts.  Part one played fine. Part 2 failed to play at all.  Your software sucks.
1416955070|3.0|Ok I admit it, I drank the City of Bones Kool-Aid and I liked it.<br /><br />Is this book the most outstanding piece of literature to cross my path in all my years? Hell no<br /><br />Has the concept of the story been done before? Why yes, yes it has. A young teen all of a sudden discovers that they are something they did not know they were before..Can you say Buffy, Twillight, Harry Potter, Percy Jackson, and a bout a hundred others.<br /><br />Did I like the writing? Not really. I almost gave up within the first 20 pages because it sounded like it had been written by a 12 year old.<br /><br />So why you ask am do I like it ( or not asked, but I'm going to tell you anyways)?<br /><br />Despite all the issues I found with the book, I did find the book enjoyable. It was an easy read, I like the concept of the main character discovering something very different about themselves, and I like how it played out. It really was not boring, it had a lot of action, and the characters spoke like their age. There was even a little bit of some angsty teenage romance that reminded me of myself when I was that age.<br /><br />My favorite character out of the story...Jace. Yes folks i very much liked him. I never thought he was an ass or a jerk. A smart ass perhaps, but so am I and I have always loved other smart asses as well. I feel kinda sorry for the poor guy. He did'nt have the most normal childhood. So I kinda have to give him some slack for some of his attitude. hey it could be worse, he could have turned out like Jeffrey Dahmer.<br /><br />So..I can't wait to read the other books in this series. Yes I know, roll your eyes & shake your head at me. I can deal with it!
B005LAIHXQ|3.0|Yes, it IS colossal, it DOES have mind-bending SFX, it certainly grips the viewer and probably no one but Ridley Scott could put on a show like this. That said, it seems to be an epic missing a story and one with actors who could have been given a more literate script.  Rapace does not disappoint, but even she (who received top billing for this) can only do so much. If you liked the \\"Alien\\" series, this is certainly your cup of tea and you get your money's worth in movie magic.  Many scenes do beg of the imagination and we can only have wished Charlize had more to say than the script gave her. Certainly good flick to go with the popcorn...
1475143389|4.0|Just imagine that some takes the (HUGE) time to synthesize for you a lot of what's tried in bodybuilding and then contrasts and verifies it with science, in less than 200 pages. Add to this an author willing that you communicate with him and that answers almost every comment about his book with arguments that make sense.<br /><br />This is definitely going to save you lots of time and clarify your mind.<br /><br />The only \\"bad\\" things I have to say about it are:<br />- Unfortunately, Michael Matthews, the author, does not acknowledge any specific formation on the area or any bodybuilding title BUT the info is really backed up by scientific papers and, in addition, (although it is up to you to trust this), common sense (nothing sounds unhealthy, hard to believe, tied to any commercial brand, contrary to what is said in bodybuilding forums...) and his experience of 10 years lifting weights as a \\"normal\\" person, which may be way more useful for people like me.<br />- The layout of contents: it is not bad and it is really readable and enjoyable, it would have been nice to have the info structure in better blocks of knowledge (such as Motivation, Workout ...) than one chapter after the other.<br /><br />I haven't tried his method yet (but I have tried parts of it before reading it and I can tell that I agree with him based on my experience, such as the incredible effect of HIIT, the low rep range...) but I'm going to do it and I'm almost sure that is going to give great results.
B003K1EYM6|5.0|We bought this to take on vacation so we could load pictures onto my ipad and share them on facebook. It works great!! Makes sharing so much easier!
1610390938|5.0|For those who work or are just interested in the field of global aid, this can be enjoyed by all. Anecdotal and scientific, a great mix of varying experiences and findings by economists and aid workers. I found the author's ideas refreshing and optimistic. Banerjee and Duflo are obviously brilliant.
B009IEXKXI|5.0|I won't go on much, I just wanted to say it was a refreshingly fun, feel-good story. There were a lot of laugh out loud moments, the story moved along at a good pace, and the ending was satisfying.<br />I think I paid two bucks for this book. I've paid a whole lot more for a whole lot less. I was so pleased with the value that I took time to leave a review.<br /><br />Thanks for sharing your story with me, Andy. I'm going to go look right now and see if you've written anything else for me to read. Well done, my man!!!
B001ANYDAO|5.0|Just a great read. Malcolm Gladwell is always interesting and his subject matter is wonderfully diverse. Have recommended to others.
B004UPAN6W|4.0|First time I was disappointed but watched it again last night and it was much better. Can't wait for the next x-men with the old and first class time travel. Woot!
B00AA0TZTW|4.0|This has a couple tracks not heard on many Hendrix albums. I am a huge fan so I buy pretty much any and all Hendrix albums. There are a lot of good ones out there that have great live and unreleased versions of great songs. Hendrix has bad business sense and signed all  and any record contracts that were offered to him. Look around, Whooping Cat is one record label he signed onto that has a lot of great and rare tracks.
B002DQLGHU|5.0|I've never been the kind of person that buys into hype and to be honest, I hate most big budget films, So until this weekend, I've avoided everything Harry Potter. That being said, I have never met anyone who had anything bad to say about the Potter films, so I finally decided to give it a shot, and boy was I surprised! For those select few who don't know the story, Harry Potter is the son of two legendary wizards, who was hidden with distant relatives, in order to protect him. Until his eleventh birthday, he had no idea that he was famous or had the potential to be the most power wizard the world has ever known. Potter is invited to join the Hogwarts school of wizardry and that is when the adventure begins. British Actor, Daniel Radcliffe, plays Potter and is nothing short of spectacular. Before the Potter films, Radcliffe had very limited acting experience and many say, he got the part, because of his resemblance to Harry Potter on the cover of the book. That may be how he got the part, but he defiantly shows he has the talent to go along with the right look. His performance was terrific, but there is something to be said about having the right Director, and Christopher Columbus was the perfect choice. Columbus has a ton of experience working with young newcomers in films with high expectations. Overall, the story is extremely well written, the young cast was refreshing and full of energy, the direction was stellar, and the set, costumes, and effects were some of the best I've ever seen. I'm not going to go run out and join a quitage team, but I am going to see the rest of the series. Harry Potter is a huge budget franchise, but for once, a blockbuster film does live up to the hype, and earns the title of a must see movie!
B00BMKDTNC|5.0|Finally after 12 years or so I have finished the series. There were obvious differences once Sanderson took over after the loss of Jordan, but all in all it was the epic conclusion I have been waiting for. Well done.
B003MC5N28|5.0|Great read. Definitely makes you think about your own life and how it could be if you lived in the community.
B004QL7K8E|3.0|First off it looks like a 5 year old filmed it Blair Witch style and secondly the acting is HORRIBLE
B008MM9630|5.0|This game has great pictures and sound. You rarely have to use real money and it is super fun. I just can't stop playing!!!
B006MW3UZW|5.0|My friends Amanda I are totally addicted to this show. I absolutely love all of the characters and can't wait to watch the next season!!
B004SBS8LA|5.0|can get you angry enough to keep on playing.a great way to spend waiting some where.such as doctors offices,airlines,road trips.Easy to do fun to do .a crowd gatherer.
B000U7XUKK|5.0|I have been a fan of Arcade Fire for years and enjoyed seeing them in concert. I purchased this album to help round out my AF collection :)
B000FCKGPC|5.0|This is truly an epic story of friends snd foes, heros and traitors. As the story develops in parallell you continue to explore the contradictory world of Westeros and the free cities. When you think the story is about to become predictable it suddenly shifts and the gameplan is changed in an instant. The weak becomes the strong and the strong goes weak. If you've read the first books in this epos there is really no going back, just buy it and start the feast!
B000TO0TCQ|5.0|This was the best Alex rider book yet. It was fast-paced, with just a bit of humor and suspense. There is a lot of double crossing wich keeps you on your feet for the entire book. I strongly recommend this book to anyone who is a fan of Alex rider! I hope you fund this review helpful.
B004LROUNG|5.0|I really a enjoy almost all of John Grishams books and this was no exception, Typical plot twists and interesting insights into inner workings of legal profession.
B00AN0KGWE|5.0|How do they come up with this stuff?  Great scenes, background, story lines.  I am hooked.<br />Like a good book that is hard to put down.  Can't wait for the next season.
B006LSZECO|5.0|I read this book on recommendation of a friend who is a teacher.  Others had said it took a number of chapters to really get into the story but I was hooked after only a couple.  Just when I thought I had it figured out, there would be a totally unexpected twist.  I was totally involved to the end.
B007BVMVDU|5.0|How do they come up with this stuff?  Great scenes, background, story lines.  I am hooked.<br />Like a good book that is hard to put down.  Can't wait for the next season.
B00BEZTMWW|5.0|Really enjoyed the version of the book.  There are some variations pulled from Tolkien's other works and incorporated to make enough content for a trilogy.
B00AAQRNQ8|5.0|I needed this as I used my old mouse for my mac for gaming, and this was for my windows 7 laptop. its very quick and responsive. haven't fully tested it out just yet but works for me. would recommend it to others
B00B2YH7BS|5.0|Big Foo fan, so I take an interest in anything that Dave and the guys do. I loved it, I think every Foo fan will enjoy it.
1594744769|4.0|This book is filled with vivid imagination, that the photos help bring to life. When browsing don't be scared to look through the photos, they do not spoil anything in the book and are beautiful.<br /><br />The opening really gets you involved in the story it's a about Jacob and his grandfather, and his grandfather tells wild tails of how he escaped Nazi occupied poland and how he fought monsters, Jacob is growing the whole time, and the audience grows with as dream filled child to a skeptical teenager, who drifts apart.  Then a tragedy strikes making Jacob revaluate his grandfathers old stories and try to find truth in them.<br /><br />Then Jacob gets a psychiatrist that tells him it would do good to go to the island where these stories took place his father who's writing a book on bird's is convinced togo cause the island is full of rare birds, He finds the place where all his grandfather's stories took place in a war torn mansion, that hasn't had a visitor in quite a long time. Then things got really interesting and there's a million of spoilers. so I don't want to say anymore.<br /><br />The  Peculiars are interesting I could've spent more time with them, it take a while, like a hundred pages to solve the mystery and be introduced to them then I felt like I only had a hundred pages to get to know all nine Peculiars about form of them and their head mistress we get to know pretty well until the danger hits then we don't  learn any more characters.  he loop was really interesting I could have spent more time talking about that.<br /><br />The romance really works in the book, and the mystery are really good as well, towards the end durning the action I did feel it was written as well it was very hard to describe, and the bad creature was a little to cage and the description at the beginning of the book seemed different towards the end.<br /><br />This book does in a cliff hanger sort of theirs a lot of things left unresolved which I didn't like, and was totally unprepared for.<br /><br />I would recommend this book for teenagers 13 to read alone ten to read with a parent, there's a lot of drinking jokes, and a little adult humor. It reminded me of a Roald Dahl book, in some parts, and the Maximum Ride series.<br /><br />If there is a sequel then I will read itprepared for.<br /><br />I would recommend this book for teenagers 13 to read alone ten to read with a parent, there's a lot of drinking jokes, and a little adult humor.

B003O86FMW|4.0|This writer is very good at painting a great mental visual with her writing.  The books are hard to put down once you start reading!  I loved the movie adaptation of the first Hunger Games.  I loved the characters and I think that is one reason I wanted to read the books too!  Now, I can not wait for the second book to be made into a movie! I am reading the third book now and I know that i will be done all too soon.  Highly recommended!
B002S45V32|5.0|Come on this is a Classic if you grew up in the 80s like me!  It's great fun to see the stars look so young.  The story is also a classic boy meets girl - what is there not to love???
B000M343BM|5.0|There have been a lot of baseball movies made over many decades.  Most are serious, but some are funny.  Major League (1989) is funny.  It's about the last place Cleveland Indians who can't seem to buy a win if they tried.  Fan attendance is terrible, the owner wants the team to lose so she can move the team to Miami, the players suck, and even the radio announcers are asleep at the wheel.  Does this team have any prayer at all?  Watch to find out.  This movie doesn't have just one memorable character.  Every single character is memorable, it seems.  The Indians themselves are a team full of characters.  The movie is a comedy, but it also has a lot of serious moments as well.  Just when you think a scene is going to play out completely serious, there's some comedy thrown in when you might not be expecting it.  This movie has humor, action, romance, everything.  The Indians games were actually filmed at County Stadium in Milwaukee.<br /><br />The Natural (1984) is my favorite baseball movie, but Major League is a classic comedy that I highly recommend when you're in the mood for a baseball movie that's funny.
B007GE2H3G|5.0|If you haven't seen it yet, I highly suggest you do. Tin Tin is Steven Spielberg's attempt  at turning the great Comic into an animation film using a virtual camera. It really has a Indiana Jones live-action meets the beloved Toy Story animated film feel to it. You will watch the movie and see what a long way Animated films has come.
B002UM5BXW|4.0|Your restaurant dining experiences will never be the same again.  The bowels of a big time restaurant are a pressure cooker day in and night out.  The under belly of the restaurant world is truly exposed.  Not for the faint at heart!
B007IXWL2C|3.0|The writing in this book is absolutely terrible, repetitive and predictable.<br /><br />Somehow, this kept me completely interested and I, shamefully, can say I've read all three in the series.
B004ECFW94|4.0|Domingo sings remarkably well for a 69-year-old, but he doesn't sound like a baritone; I heard Invar Wixell and Piero Cappucilli sing it live, and liked them better
B000OZ0NXA|4.0|Good story line. Very detailed plot. Some tactical stuff was inaccurate. Almost like the author tried too hard to explain tactical strategy. I would read another especially to compare author's writing technique to this book.
B000FBFN1U|4.0|Really enjoy the mix of medieval and fantasy. Political jockeying is like a slow chess match.  Can't wait to finish and get onto book 4.
B008VBYN80|1.0|Over the past month, the only thing the game hasn't done is work correctly.  I can't ask for anything so I'm stuck in the story and can't advance.  I can't log into gameloft.  I can't send out gifts to friends, or visit them.  The game freezes up and I have to restart my phone to fix it.  When I am able to play I dont get to keep any xp i earned from the previous playtime cause it resets it back to 0.  And now I just logged into facebook to PVP, it reset all my battle rankings.  And oved the past month I have been assured 5 different times that in the next couple days a updte will be realeased to fix all the problems.
B00BGDF1FO|5.0|Absolutely amazing music! I recommend this even if you don't like the game. My favorite track is &#34;Only Thing I Know for Real&#34;.
B000E6EHGI|4.0|Thought I was selecting an option that would include AutoRip.  Missed the distinction in choices, so am missing the satisfaction that would have come from Cloud access.  Enable retro conversion for validated albums, and I'm going to be a solid fan.
B00942G4UA|5.0|A truly eye-opening and sobering film, that has motivated a lasting change in my diet.  The atrocities of our modern food industry is quite sickening... I am thankful for people to expose the hidden wrongs
B008B11R1Q|5.0|...this is an AMAZING CD in my opinion...maybe not breaking new ground...but very unique, deep, meaningful music.  I can listen to both of their CDs over and over again nonstop for hours on end....always depends on what you like of course....other stuff i like...Everything But the Girl, Sade, Kevin Yost....mostly, chill, lounge music...electronic, ambient, alternative....buy this and enjoy!
B0050DIWFC|5.0|Defending Jacob is not only suspenseful but with all of its twists and turns it does not allow you to put it down. I highly recommend this one. Definitely one of my favorite reads.
B007N8RULO|2.0|I loved this game,played all the time. All of a sudden yesterday it started putting the cards on the same color,wouldn't let me move appropriate cards manually and just was exasperating!!! Called tech support for Kindle, he reset my Kindle(lost my pictures & bookmarks) but it still won't work. Tried deleting & reinstalling, didn't help. Any one else have this problem?
0545265355|5.0|Just what she wanted & will def look for more book buy for her in comimg months. Thank you so much!
034580404X|5.0|my husband wanted to read this so i got it for him.i did not care for the reviews,so i was not interested.  later, i ran out of reading material and started reading them. this is not classic stuff ,it is entertainment . they are fun books, cute, light hearted and funny sometimes.  they took my mind off of my day to day problems for  a while.  i read them all in a week.
B00BMKDTNC|5.0|I don't know that I've ever been as thoroughly satisfied with a book series as I was with the Wheel of Time -- especially after Brandon Sanderson picked it up. And A Memory of Light is the absolute best of the bunch. Sanderson truly captures the essence of what Robert Jordan began, and although some of the events in the book made me a little sad, I felt a genuine sense of fulfillment and closure at the end.<br /><br />If you've been reading the Wheel of Time series, do NOT miss this book!<br /><br />But, um, DO read the books that precede this one first. Things will make a lot more sense that way ;-)
B003JTHXOK|4.0|This was a good story.  It was heart warming and had a very surprising ending. Reminded me of \\"Sleeping with the Enemy.\\"
B0089EHWQE|5.0|\\"Me Before You\\" is an emotional insightful story that will have you pondering the meaning of life.<br /><br />After losing her job at a local tea shop Louisa has to find another job and reluctantly accepts a six month position as a companion for Will Traynor. Will is brash, ill tempered and lives a discontented life, permanently in a wheel chair, and at the mercy of others.<br /><br />What is absolutely beautiful about this story is how the two come together and fall in love. While Will's plight is explored so is Louisa's even though hers is not as obvious.  The characters are superbly developed and jump off the page with realism while the plot has depth and moves along at the perfect pace. Much of the narrative is written from Louisa's point of view however there are a few excerpts from others such as Will's parents.<br /><br />Moyes seamlessly educates readers in regards to the trials and tribulations of a paraplegic's daily routine as well as introduces the controversial idea of euthanasia.  Should assisted suicide be legal?  How deteriorated does a persons health need to be before it is okay? Should those who assist be held legally accountable? These are just a few of the questions that arise.<br /><br />The ending is predictable leaving you soaking wet from tears but the story is so intricate and intimate that it will be tough to put down.
B0089LOG02|5.0|I had never heard of this part of American history before and was very moved by a story that could have been one of many children of the time.  This was a well written book,  and kept my interest from beginning to end.  One of those books you hate to see come to an end.
B00AZNEW5G|5.0|Love this movie.  I would advise everyone to see this movie.  It keeps you in your seat wondering what else is going to happen.
B006VFLIYK|5.0|Another Baldacci novel with more twists and turns than a bag of Twizzlers. Great story lines and interwoven plot twists.
B001PPLIEG|5.0|I LOVE IT!  Daniel Craig is wonderful in both pictures.  He does justice as 007.  His walk is just great.  I saw those movies and went home and pre-ordered the DVD.  I also like Judi.  I also saw Sky Fall and ordered the DVD.  My daughter and I enjoyed these three movies.  I think Craig is the best of the individuals who have played James Bond.  5 Stars!  Sometime the action was almost too much!  Great, great, really great!<br /><br />bond
B00284G2IA|4.0|This is the last concert Nightwish did before they fired Tarja later that night.  I'd say that they were successful.  Emppu is really &#34;on&#34; during the whole show.  My reason for not giving it a 5/5 is that I would have liked to have seen it done more as concert footage than a music video like it is at some points, and there are some facets of a few songs that I simply dislike, even on the studio versions.  (Tarja is a fantastic singer.  Why is Marco screaming in the otherwise quite good &#34;Slaying the Dreamer&#34;?)
B001BKTEZA|5.0|Has always been my favorite. For all that have so much today, this should be required reading. History does repeat itself.
B008602KQI|5.0|The first book absolutely captured me! The author developed the characters well with a great descriptive storyline that kept me reading for hours. Book 2-catching fire- had the same descriptiveness but, in my opinion, didn't hook me in as much. Don't worry, book 3-mocking jay- re-excited me all over again! There were some surprising twists you weren't expecting. Overall, this is a great series for someone who enjoys fiction stories about futuristic societies and can handle a little violence and facing some depressing realities of our current society.
1849025975|5.0|I love Orwell's writing and he didn't disappoint me here. His description of his militia going to the Zaragoza front for the first time still makes me smile when I read it: \\"We straggled along with far less cohesion than a flock of sheep\\". I like Orwell's fiction but I think he is at his best when recounting his experiences.<br /><br />From what Orwell writes, the Republican police/Civil Guards and the PSUC (the Catalan Communist party) acted shamefully. They cared more about getting rid of opposition to themselves in Barcelona than in fighting the Fascists at the front, and kept the better weapons for this. At the front soldiers had old rifles and no proper oil for them (instead they had to use olive oil or whatever other lubricants they could get ahold of), few machine guns and no pistols, while the police in Barcelona had machine guns and automatic pistols. This is like how Stalin spent more energy eliminating conceivable threats to his own power in the Soviet Union than preparing for an attack by Germany. Writing about the Belgian soldier Georges Kopp, who had fought with POUM and had been imprisoned by some combination of the PSUC and police, Orwell says \\"He was a man who had sacrificed everything- family, nationality, livelihood- simply to come to Spain and fight against Fascism.... And all they could do in return was to fling him into jail. It is waste of time to be angry, but the stupid malignity of this kind of thing does try one's patience.\\"<br /><br />Orwell has a subdued anger at journalists who wrote about the Spanish Civil War without having gone to the front and who did not understand what was really happening in Barcelona or other cities. They wrote as if what was happening was just a convenient starting point to elaborate according to their political ideas of what ought to be happening. Denying that there is such a thing as objective truth is to me the main horror Orwell tried to convey with 1984, and I think his ideas about this came from seeing the lack of correspondence between what he read in foreign and Spanish Communist newspapers and what he saw in Spain. In his essay \\"Looking Back on the Spanish War\\", Orwell writes, \\"I know it is the fashion to say that most of recorded history is lies anyway. I am willing to believe that history is for the most part inaccurate and biased, but what is peculiar to our own age is the abandonment of the idea that history could be truthfully written.... It is just this common basis of agreement, with its implication that human beings are all one species of animal, that totalitarianism destroys.\\"<br /><br />Either before you read this book or while you're reading it, you should glance at the Wikipedia pages for POUM, PSUC, CNT, UGT, the Popular Front, and look at a map of Spain to know where places like Huesca, Zaragoza and Barcelona are. And I think it would help to have a map of Barcelona available when you're reading Orwell's description of the fighting in that city, especially to know what the Ramblas is. Orwell talks about the conflicts between the POUM and the PSUC but assumes to some extent that the reader already knows what these organizations are. These are all things that would just take a few minutes to look up; what would take longer is learning about what led to the Spanish Civil War, which Orwell hardly talks about (because he is giving an account of what it was like to be in the middle of things, not an historical summary).
B00BO2VKBG|5.0|A unique band. Great sabbathy type riffs, eerie lyrics, John Lennon-esque vocal style. Beautiful psychedelic sounds.<br />A must have. I traveled from Los Angeles to London last month to see them play two nights in a row. Of course they rocked! Uncle Acid is awesome!
B00C1XZ2LQ|4.0|I think the Oblivion soundtrack, streaming on Mashable.com, is a decent soundtrack. But it's more subdued and lacks the epic grandeur of some of the Tron Legacy songs.
B000HEWEDK|5.0|I was just a kid when I first watched that film.<br />I just loved it and the fantastic special effects ( very good ones even by today standards ).<br />Anne Francis was a wonderful vision in her short dresses.<br />Now I have my own copy.
B0045HCIYA|5.0|A movie about a single mom doing what she has to do for custody of her daughter, especially after a bad court decision. There is plenty of comedy, but plenty of serious stuff. The dancing is amazing; I guess Demi did it all herself. I'm sure she had great teachers, but you have to be able to move to pull off that kind of dancing.  Her movie daughter is her real life daughter, Rumor. Burt Reynolds and Armand Assante prove why they are enduring stars. Just overall an excellent movie, in my opinion.
B00BI745AA|1.0|The book and play were great.  This movie...  Why did they have to make it a musical (with bad singing).
B000SJJCX4|5.0|Great tuner for the price. It works much better off of a steady power source then battery though.  All in all a great value.
B0059XTUVI|1.0|I was really disappointed in The Iron Lady. Sure, Meryl Streep knocks another one out of the park (the woman is truly remarkable and one of the greatest actors of all time), but I was hoping for a historical drama and I got instead a lurid drama about a woman suffering from dementia. I'm neither a fan nor a hater of Thatcher. Matter-of-fact, I don't really know much about her at all even as I knew of her and recall some of the events out of the UK in the 70s and 80s. I wanted to watch, especially in the aftermath of her recent passing, to get some perspective, even if it was Hollywood-ized. This movie was a travesty. Unless the point of the movie was to show the ravages of Alzheimer's or dementia - and it wasn't - there's little excuse for such a cold blooded production, regardless of how you feel about her and her political record. For God's sake, I've seen Hitler given more compassionate treatment.<br /><br />I kept waiting for it to settle into a continual story of her rise and career, but just when it got going; we were back to her home and her stumbling incoherence. Historical content was given a back seat and a great opportunity to lay her career out for public examination was thrown out in the process. In choosing cheap titillation over more tasteful and intellectually appealing options, the film fails terribly. What a waste of a great performance.
B009NQKPUW|3.0|It has many interesting ideas and some really awesome special effects.  The part that I didn't care for is the nitpicky nerd in me's fault.  Several things that take place in the movie contradict things established in previous movies set in the same universe.  As a stand alone film, it is entertaining and interesting with wonderful effects.  As an entry in the Aliens universe it leaves a bit to be desired with massive plot holes relative to the other films.
B002RXHW6S|1.0|DO NOT BUY!!!!!!!! They send two order for me and both came with a leak!!!!<br />What I gonna tell to my kid?? He start to cry every time that we show to him the toy and them we send it back because this toy doesn't work! Twice???????? it is unbelievable!!!<br />RESPECT YOUR CUSTOMERS AND STOP TO SELL IT!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
B00AB0Z88S|5.0|Mesmerizing images abound throughout this movie and will keep your attention whether or not you find the story hard to swallow. The 3D effects are not overdone. Though a little longer than expected, I've watched it twice and could watch it again.
B007ZGO7EM|1.0|It was dissapointing, no better that the built in one. I couldn't figure out how to switch modes to make it do all the things it said it could
B004J4WKTW|5.0|Love the characters, setting, and plot of the book.  Morgenstern created a world of fantasy that kept me hooked up until the end.
B005SAJJHM|5.0|Such a fun show that makes you laugh out loud! We love to watch this show...great stress relief after a long day!
B00BFUUMO8|5.0|Jurassic Park Builder is a very fun game to play. I look forward to picking up my Kindle to play and challenge myself to achieve the game missions. One thing I would change is larger dollar bill rewards to earn the T-Rex, and Stegosaurus. I don't want to spend $ to get these dinosaurs. Overall, an excellent game.
B00BEPVAV8|5.0|I just bought a game called Beach Buggy Blitz. In my opinion it is really cool! I like this game because I love racing games. I can support that because in the game, you are racing against the computer. In additon, while you are racing, you collect coins that you later can use to buy an avatar,new vehicle, powerups, and gadgets.This is why I think Beach Buggy Blitz is awesome!
B004ZJZPZC|5.0|Love the movie, actors and actresses. And the music. Good value for the money and recommend the blue ray copy
B003QTSMXE|5.0|A bit of anime, sci-fi and romance blended up in a tale that's kind of short on dialogue and long on super-cuteness.  Wall-E, quite a remarkable little fellow appears to be the last in a series of machines charged with a massive planetary clean up job that will take him eons to complete alone.  It is clear that whatever humanity has managed to do to botch up the environment, it was bad enough to leave the surface pockmarked, scarred, littered with garbage and removed all traces of blue from the sky.  This blight seems to have caused mass exodus from our planet and transformed what's left of the human race to the most supreme obesity-riddled couch potatoes of the future.  What is evident from the very first scenes is how special he is and the rest of the story rides on the coat-tails of that understanding.  Wall-E has a lot of built in charm and the story sends a message about conservation and care of the earth while also asking us to look at issues of food and weight, inactivity and how we substitute playing with technology in place of good old human interaction.  &#60;3
B008NW67IQ|5.0|Listen, if you're a dude and you're looking to talk to girls you better buy this album. This is all girls are talking about. Name three songs and she'll wanna talk to you. Sing it on karaoke and you're golden. Thank you dirty indie bands!
B000ZLFALI|4.0|The sound track is the best part of this movie.  my teens watch it over and over.  Hard to get that kind of value from something these days.
B005WUHAX8|1.0|I bought 2 lifeproof, for my wife iphone and for me. My red lifeproof is great but my wifes pink lifeproof Im sure is not an original product.<br /><br />The first day it craked without even falling. The following week the plastic clear cover ( where you touch the screen ) had a big bump.<br /><br />Yo can see the difference on quality material on both Lifeproof.
0316017930|5.0|Malcolm Gladwell is a great writer, explaining the unpredictable and unexpected!  His clear writing style makes this a quick read, and gives you lots to think about.  A great follow up to the first book.  I'm hooked.
B0029LCJJS|5.0|The wonderful story of Henry the 8th  is well casted!  It had us captured quickly. I would rewatch this series over and over again!
B005COO1X6|4.0|Lived up to SK's standards, wished there was a little more to the story. Still kept me reading thru the suspense.
B00B23O96A|3.0|Just one year after Sir Paul released an album of old standard classics, Clapton has now done the same. Not as good as Paul's effort, but one song (Gotta Get Over) makes it worth while. That is the only modern-sounding track on the album. None of the offerings were written by Clapton.
B0092EE5HY|5.0|I gave Tuf Voyaging five stars because it was such a great and exciting read. The character development and descriptive action makes this a series of fun adventures that I wish would not end. We could all be a little more Tuf.
B003W5C0VW|4.0|Although it would have been nice if they didn't just keep the camera facing the band (mostly Mick Jagger) the whole time, this was a great concert to capture the Stones at their music-best. Mick Taylor has been the best guitar player the band has ever had, and he is cooking on this DVD.
B002KYHZLQ|5.0|Fantastic world and magic system with a tight plot and deft writing. Worth getting into, no doubt. Diverse characters come together in an unexpected climax that leaves you wanting more.
B004NOH9LC|4.0|Good casting and a good story. Not too deep but there are a couple lessons in there. Harrison Ford is great as the crusty older anchor.
B0063IH60K|5.0|Simple free easy to use it's pretty much what you think it is adds are annoying but it's free so good enough
B003YFIUW8|5.0|The thing about a good book is that it's suppose to pull you in so that you become apart of it. &#34;Room&#34; is that kind of book. From the first page, until the last, I felt like Jack was telling me the story of his life.<br /><br />I wish I could articulate how this book made me feel. The closest I can get is to say it made me claustrophobic, more so in the latter parts of the book. I can't imagine living these characters lives. Ms Donoghue has done an excellent job with this story. I highly recommend this book.
B0034G4P8A|4.0|With a more than solid cast, led by Anthony Hopkins and Chris Hemsworth, and a fantastic director in Kenneth Branagh, this movie was pretty darn awesome. The look of Asgard is grand and epic and really looks like a cross between magic & technology.The costumes were really well done as well, they looked functional, well being otherworldy. The action was pretty brutal and kick ass, seeing Thor wielding Mjolnir, his hammer, and just hurling it at the enemy is great. The action over all was pretty well done, although sometimes it was a bit to chaotic. The story did feel a bit rushed in parts, and the romance aspect was a bit limp, but considering how much had to be introduced and explained about the Asgardians, they did a good job. Can't wait to see where they go with the sequel.
B005C8ENI0|4.0|Kept me interested, good job taking seemingly unrelated events/people and connecting them.  I will probably watch it again just to see it from a new perspective.
B005IZLPMY|4.0|I was hopeful that this movie would be good, as Joe Johnston did really awesome with the period movie Rocketeer & Chris Evans may finally show that he is more than the goof ball, he can actually act, as seen in Sunshine and even Push. My hope was well founded & exceeded, as it was everything I could have wanted and more. It just worked, and Chris Evans was Steve Rogers, Captain America. The Story was fantastic & enjoyable, as was the action. Aside from Evans, the rest of the cast were perfect, especially Tommy Lee Jones & Hugo Weaving, as well as Dominic Cooper as Howard Stark. My only real nit picky complaint was that the movie could have had more Howling Commandos in it, or at least let is in on their names during the movie, maybe next time. From the story & look to the acting & action plus it's connections to the Marvel Cinematic Universe & The Avengers, I can't recommend this movie enough.
B001HN6922|4.0|This was a cute movie. Not as good as the first but sequels rarely are. still a pretty good movie
B0021L8V1Q|3.0|Coming off the success of the first Iron Man movie, it was inevitable that a sequel would be made. So we have RDJ once again donning his Iron Man armor, with the same charismatic appeal he unleashed in the 1st movie, now with the added smarmyness of Sam Rockwell as Justin Hammer, Mickey Rourke exuding malice in the role of Ivan Vanko/Whiplash & the always stunning Scarlett Johansson as Black Widow. Also along for the ride are many returning actors, except one, as the phenomenal Don Cheadle has stepped into the role of James Rhodes & eventually suits up in his own War Machine armor. RDJ adds more depth to the role of Tony Stark, as he has to deal with his own technology slowly killing him, as well as his father's past coming back to hinder, but eventually helping him & also the wider heroic world come calling in the guise of Samuel L. Jackson's Nick Fury & S.H.I.E.L.D. Though the movie is overstuffed at times, RDJ & Co. keep it a fun ride that rockets us ever closer to The Avengers.
B0030IIZ4M|5.0|Love the detail and the story line. Very kid friendly which is hard to come by even in Disney movies
B001KVZ6HK|5.0|Joss Whedon's The Avengers is a perfect movie, with very minor flaws. Watching the movie filled me with the awe & excitement of a true spectacle, well at the same time making me genuinely laugh out loud, & also making me feel for these soldiers out of time, flawed men in armor, assassins seeking redemption, Gods who make mistakes, marksmen trying not to miss the target & scientists filled with anger. All the actors involved pulled me in & catapulted me through this massive vision of powerful beings colliding physically & mentally. Joss showed the innate property of Marvel characters, though they may posses abilities beyond normal humans, they still feel, have flaws, make mistakes, have good days & bad, they are still grounded in humanity, even the demigods, that you begin to identify with their struggles & want them to persevere & win the day. Joss Whedon, only he could have assembled such a great movie, he truly deserves the adoration of movie goers worldwide.
B007IXWKUK|2.0|It was an ok read. Was expecting more. All the explicit parts had become far to predictable and less needed.
B004JMSIRC|4.0|Marvel Studios shows that with quality talent, an enthusiastic director & a story that doesn't stray far from the source material, comic book movie's can be more than a special f/x reel. Robert Downey, Jr. owns the role of Tony Stark, the mercurial genius inventor & president of Stark Industries, bringing the human element to the armored avenger. Be it his over the top public persona, or his reinvention after his abduction by terrorists, or his more comedic moments, RDJ brings Stark out of the comic page & imbues him with enough of himself that an audience is willing to take flight when he finally dons the armor. RDJ is ably assisted by his strong willed girl friday, Pepper Potts, enjoyably played by Gwyneth Paltrow. As well as his military liaison and friend James Rhodes, here played by Terrence Howard. And as antagonist we get the ever amazing Jeff Bridges, looking like he is enjoying being quite evil. The movie isn't perfect, but is still great, Iron Man always entertains.
B00AREIAI8|4.0|Very very fun. Always something to do with this game. Everyone should have this game and recommend it to all their friends
B00C6B8TB8|4.0|Universal's 2nd try at a Hulk film is much better than the Ang Lee directed movie, moving past the \\"Daddy Issues\\" & getting to more of what the audience wants, to see Hulk Smash! Though the movie is more action orientated, that doesn't mean it leaves the characters and their story arcs behind, as Bruce Banner truly grows from his experiences throughout the movie, getting past his need to \\"cure\\" himself, and moving forward in accepting what he is. Casting of this movie was great, headed by the remarkable Edward Norton, playing Bruce Banner on the run perfectly, with equal parts tragedy & humanity, as he comes to terms with the power he holds within himself. As the dual foils for Bruce/Hulk to play off of is William Hurt as \\"Thunderbolt\\" Ross, on his Ahab like search for his green whale, also along for the ride is Tim Roth as Emil Blonsky/Abomination, finally, as the calming force in Bruce's life is Liv Tyler as Betty Ross. With big action & an enjoyable story, a truly worthy Hulk movie.
B00AEJM6H2|5.0|Been playing Jewels Star for a few weeks and I have to say I'm not bored or tired with it at all. I have other Jewel match games, but I always come back to this one. There are several modes of play to keep it interesting. No annoying adds popping up all the time. You don't feel like the game is going to cut you off any moment, so it's calm and fun not  frenzied. Give it a try if you like this type of game this is a good one to download.
B0016BP0PW|5.0|Gift for my daughter, I saw her light up when I told her the movie was on television.  I know she will be excited to have both the video and sound track.  The movie was definitely engaging  as my daughter sang along with the characters.  It was just nice to see my daughter engaged and focused again.
B004UJTG6Q|1.0|I thought this book was not very interesting, because I could barely pay attention and finish it. It was a long story.
B00275EHJG|5.0|If you liked Toy Story and Toy Story 2, then you will LOVE Toy Story 3.<br />I had to watch it a few hundred times by now, since this is THE favorite movie of my son (almost 3 years old) and he watches it over and over and over again. Sometimes I have to make him stop the movie and sush him outside to get some fresh air, otherwise he would sit in front of the computer and watch it.<br />Anyway, the story is very adorable. My favorite character is Mr. Potato Head. I just love his sarcastic comments. :)<br />My entire family enjoyed this movie.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|I absolutely love it it is the best game ever . I think there can be more options do  your character ,and for the people that chase you .and that there could be more power ups .
B001AW156U|1.0|not a good fit. This was a waist of my money. They didn't even come in a box, probably used
B00BG08FKK|5.0|This product was everything i thought it would be and came on the day it said. the only thing is, is that it was a little slanted but thats ok the cd was perfect!!!!
0802473156|5.0|This changed my way of understanding my wife and her understanding me. This was a college book, but I would buy this if you want to be a better husband and better wife. This book will cause growth in your life.
B00000GAIW|5.0|This is a great record from an excellent group, what can I say...it's art! And it's in great condition.  seriously?
B00985E3UG|4.0|Shortly after starting to read this book I realized that my eating habits must change.  I began reading labels and counting milligrams.  Very powerful and eye opening.
B00CDSVZHY|3.0|This movie started out fantastic but as soon as the Candieland (Leonardo DiCaprio) middle section evolved, it was a huge disappointment.  Overall a 3 on a scale of 5.
B00CBRI9G2|1.0|This movie has no dialogue to speak of, it is filmed strangely and is absolutely absurd. I can't think of one redeeming value in this film.
B00881VLCE|5.0|I think this is an excellent puzzle game with multiple difficulty levels . Which makes it possible to select the option you have time for.
B00A0SLTCU|2.0|I liked the original Total Recall better. Sometimes remakes are good. But, for me I just didn't care for this movie.
B008XBCJ34|5.0|I had seen this movie before, but it so much more in 3D.  It really comes to life and makes a great movie even better.
B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|I have Amazon Prime so I get free movie streaming to my phone, iPad and TVs. Best series ever! I can't wait until season 4!
B008SAZHLQ|5.0|This is a book that I thought I would not like. As a young teen who doesn't believe in love, it seems odd that I would buy a book like this. But, it made me want to believe in love. This book is so cute and deals with some situations that show how love can make even the darkest situations seem not so bad. The characters seemed so real and it felt like I was watching a romance play out between two friends of mine. I would recommend this to anybody! Please read it now.
B005ZOBNOI|5.0|Although the storyline is a tragic one, the author handles it with loving care and infuses young hearts with genuine feelings that affirm not all young love is &#34;puppy&#34; love. The main characters are well developed and their actions and reactions revolve around wisdom beyond their years.  Often victims living with their limitations and challenges at such a young age must grow up fast and the author showed these young people up for the task.
B005LJKEXS|2.0|I ordered two of these since I'm a computer tech and like to keep extras in stock and unfortunately didn't get around to opening the box until 5 months later, way past the Amazon return policy. Turns out they mixed up the order and sent me a BlueRigger DVI to HDMI cable instead. Both of the boxes looked identical in size. I really like Amazon but I will never again let things sit on the shelf without inspecting what I got. As far as the performance of the cable I would say it does a good job but I have had times where the Alfa 1000mw adapter I was using with it would work far better when plugged in directly, and would constantly cycle on and off when plugged in through this cable. I believe it works, but I'm still skeptical and may have to order one more to test them out further or just go with another brand next time.
B008764ZQ4|3.0|The soundtrack itself is wonderful. However the download from Amazon has a lot of skips and glitch places. Not the first time either.
B009J2VR3Y|4.0|Not great, but good listening.  I got what I paid for.  Don't like being forced to use this many words.
B008G12ERC|5.0|This is another great Muse album.  I cannot stop  listening to it.  There sound is beyond any other.  If you love Muse, they did not disappoint
B008AK8FHM|4.0|I enjoy stories of the unknown and the powerful beings that exist. The book did get a bit off track for a short time
030758836X|5.0|WOW! this has to be one of THE BEST books I have ever read!  I went out of course and bought her other book.  Oddly enough I have SHARP OBJECTS sitting in my library and didn't even know it..<br />This is literally a roller coaster ride that has you rooting for both of the main the characters till the very end.  Surprises are around every corner and you don't even see them coming!<br />You must buy this book and read it!  NOW~
B0095ZQ36G|4.0|Drags a little in the beginning, but once it gets going, it's good.  It's interesting and kind of sad that Franz was getting hate calls all the way to the end of his life, but probably not from the people he was shooting at in the war.<br /><br />Easily worth taking the time to read.
B008OOYALE|5.0|Its a lot of fun and I like feeding the dragons and watching them grow you can invite friends and get rewards for different things
B0055OK2T0|3.0|The movie did not disappoint.  It was about as I expected. Action, mystery. Plot kept me guessing. Worth watching. Ok
B005PK56TA|5.0|I loved the unexpected twist & turns. the story line beggining to end. Its mystery, suspense, love & hate rolled into a crazy story!
0786956291|5.0|Good quality product with clear instructions on how to play the game and start your first adventure! I didn't know how to play at all but quickly learned the basics of 4th edition DnD and completed my first solo mission with ease and little confusion. Recommend getting this especially if you have friends who want to play!
B005K17RU0|1.0|I liked the previous version but intensely despise this update.  While it appears at first to show some thoughtful improvements it soon becomes apparent this release still requires serious debugging and adjustments to the interface, at least on the Kindle Fire.
B008JFUO4U|4.0|Hot-shot pilot moves in expensive, cutting edge fighter jets, wide-scenic shots of Tom Cruise on a motorcycle...get \\"Take My Breath Away\\" out of your head - we're talking about Oblivion here! While the similarities between Oblivion and Top Gun end at the aforementioned, there is no question that \\"Maverick\\" has all the right moves to portray galactic mechanic, Jack Harper in the most visually dazzling film of the year so far.<br /><br />Oblivion opens in 2077 after an alien threat has left Earth a barren wasteland fit only for extracting a few vital resources before humanity abandons the planet altogether to start a new existence on Saturn's largest moon, Titan. Cruise's Harper is a glorified serviceman who supervises and repairs the various resource-extraction devices along with his partner Victoria (Andrea Riseborough). As the two near the completion of their jobs on Earth, Harper begins having visions of his life prior to the mandatory memory-wipe that is required for service-workers. These visions lead him on a chain of events that cause him to question everything he thought he knew about his life.<br /><br />Director Joseph Kosinski creates a vividly rich and nuanced futuristic environment where much of the technology feels like what truly is on the horizon. Kosinski directed 2010's under-rated visual spectacle, Tron Legacy, and it is apparent that he has his finger on the pulse of crisp, sci-fi style. Narrative-wise, Oblivion is a much more complex story than is likely expected. The complexities do provide some depth to the film and force the audience to pay close attention; however, the juxtaposition between the style and the narrative is not smooth. Occasionally, the film is forced into a lull as it tries to tie up its intricate plot points without sacrificing its visual pageantry. This is most apparent in the scenes that develop the sub-plot involving a human resistance leader named Beech (Morgan Freeman) and a mysterious NASA survivor named Julia (Olga Kurylenko).<br /><br />Oblivion's chief attributes are clearly its visual elements. Freeman and Kurylenko's characters are thinly developed and the actors are mostly unremarkable.

0316228532|2.0|Bought it for my husband because he is such a Potter fan, but he didn't like it. He stopped reading it. I'll read it myself, but haven't had the time.
B000I62JAK|5.0|A great performance by Ben Stiller and all the actors including his parents who are always a riot.  Two thumbs up!
1401233384|5.0|The Flash has never been one of my favorite characters, or even a character I was ever really interested in reading about.  But Geoff Johns took The Flash and made this character very interesting and told a story that had me very interested to find out what was going to happen next and to find out if The Flash would triumph or if he would be defeated by Reverse Flash.<br /><br />***SPOILERS***  ***SPOILERS***  ***SPOILERS***<br /><br />So the fact that The Flash could run so fast that he could travel back in time was very interesting!  On top of that the fact that he used that power to go back in time and save his mother was not only cool and selfless, but it showed how good of a person he was.<br /><br />The switch where Bruce Wayne actually died that night after the movies and then his father lived and became the Batman was very cool!  Geoff Johns made this new Batman darker and grittier than the Batman we know and love and this had me turning the pages quickly to see how The Flash and this new Batman interacted.<br /><br />Flash is without his speed powers in this book, and also in this world the Justice League is non-existent so The Flash can't just go running to them looking for help, he has to rely on himself to get the job done.  On the flip side, our main villains of this comic are Aqua Man and Wonder Woman who are taking their respective armies to war with one another and the people of this world are caught in the crossfire.  So Barry has Batman help him recreate the experiment that originally gave him his powers.  He is eventually successful and he is once again a speedster.  Then Reverse Flash shows up just as Flash has gathered a fighting force of heroes in order to fight the Atlanteans and the Amazons.  Reverse Flash is defeated by Batman and Flash fixes what he did by travelling through time and set things right.  Also he brings a letter from Batman's father to Bruce Wayne and gives it to him and is actually able to bring tears to Bruce Wayne's eyes.<br /><br />***END SPOILERS***  ***END SPOILERS***  ***END SPOILERS***<br /><br />This comic took a character I couldn't care less about and made me interested in him, his powers, his backstory, and his fate.  After reading this comic I will more than likely pick up other Flash books and see if any of the other stories are this good as well.r /><br />***END SPOILERS***  ***END SPOILERS***  ***END SPOILERS***<br /><br />This comic took a character I couldn't care less about and made me interested in him, his powers, his backstory, and his fate.

B0083P1QUM|1.0|Very hard to follow , skipped some of it to get on  with the story.Had good story too much detail
B009UX2YAC|2.0|Cool game but frustrating because the swipe controls aren't iron clad. When you swipe left or right the avatar tries to jump and vice versa.  Does the opposite of what you command more often than not. Can be more frustrating than mot especially if you don't understand how to gain progress during game play, which I don't. Guess that's why my nephew rarely plays it. Cool graphics but the loose controls render it kind of a let down waste of time
B006LSZECO|2.0|This was a great book, until the end. Some parts were dark. Twisted. But after reading all those pages, some of which were redundant, it just stops. Like there should be part 2 which I would not read. Readers deserve closure. BIG waste of my time and money
B0013TXA5Y|5.0|I loved every word. It's romantic and thrilling the whole way through  I would read this again! I wouldd tell all  teens to read this
B00B1MJ02K|5.0|i like it i recomended no more nice cd i will wating for dvd to buy  done send more info
B00CEIGYAG|4.0|Good, not great.  Really on the funk side.  Anticipating the full album and hope that this is just the tip of the iceberg.  After 8 years you would hope there would be something special.
B005RJ6AIK|5.0|My Grandmother and family are from Hawaii, it brings back good memories for me. Excellent soundtrack, which I ordered for myself and my Grandmother. She is a Class of '42 graduate of Kamehameha School for Girls and she approved, so you know its good. :)
B0099Y2MYK|5.0|Unbelivably good. Given a choice, I wouldn't have killed off Matthew, but I understand he wanted out to do some stage work, so what the heck. They'll think up something for next year and as long as Maggie Smith and old Bates are in it, we'll enjoy.
B002ODEJYE|5.0|I love watching this tour! It is absolutely amazing to be able to watch it over and over and over!
B0064MGU98|5.0|keeps me wanting to watch more from week to week.  it is an intriguing show to watch and i'd recommend it to my friends.
B003LQ3YXU|5.0|Doctor Who is an awesome British SciFi TV series about a Time Lord, the &#34;Doctor&#34; who travels through time and space in his TARDIS.
B000JMKQX0|5.0|I loved it. I had to work and eat and read and that's all I was concerned with for  couple days
B00B7PIRIE|5.0|Downton Abbey is the BEST show ever.  It is like a book you can't put down!  I know you will love it too!
B007ZGBZHE|4.0|Most everything one expects from a Pendergast novel.  I would have given it 5 stars except it was not one of the Pendergast novels I had to get up nights to read.  Probably because it is all I would expect but not a notch above.
B00B2166BS|4.0|have to flip nexs 10 upside down wile in its case. Keeps my unit charged under the harshest usage. Worth the $20
B000JY8F22|4.0|I bought this movie for $2.95 in one of those \\"Treasure Hunt\\" sleeves (used DVDs from rentals) that say absolutely NOTHING about the movie.<br /><br />After settling in and getting past the WTF initial reactions, I found the acting to be superb, and the characterizations to be a little more close to home (yet stereotyped) than a lot of us want.<br /><br />But I still had that nagging thought that Jude Law is still playing the part of Alfie and that the other three characters were mirrors of him, kind of \\"Alfie and the Alfettes.\\" Nobody seemed to have a clue about what they really wanted and it appeared nobody really got to see the other person. Everybody fell for infatuation.<br /><br />Beyond that angst, not much else there.  Not a chick flick, not a date flick, not a feel gooder, and nothing any kid should see.<br /><br />If you enjoy good acting estranged from reality (or perhaps too close too it?) give it a shot.
B007WFR0QS|5.0|Not familiar with this artist when I purchased cd.  Read a review about the cd (a rave) in Entertainment magazine.  The rave review was run on target, in my opinion.  A very enjoyable cd.
B00C4QLG2O|5.0|I loved the trash talk, the comedy, the future laws and grittyness at times. T I would have liked to see a little more of how the judges lived, and why the cadets are so young.
B00BCZU8WM|4.0|First cd by Justin Timberlake that I've purchased.  Not in the least bit disappointment.  By the way, I'm 70 years old.  Really enjoy his evolved style.
B008RA3X5E|4.0|Perfect for travel or when the power goes out!  Love the ablity to dim.  It is larger than the clock that we use in our room and much brighter!
B00BI73CVI|3.0|I am not going to give any spoilers away here I just didn't care for the movie as much as I was anticipating.  For the most part everyone did a beautiful job singing with one exception.  I think the kids did a phenomenal job and actually were my favorites.  I was not a fan of Russel Crowe's singing.  Not a bad movie just not my cup of tea.  I doubt I will watch it again.
B004DLPXAO|5.0|I love that my phone is now a multi use piece of equipment.  Thanks to kindle for Andoroid, I am excited about the access I now have to read my favorite book anytime, anywhere.
B0064MGU98|5.0|Story, writing, directing, acting.....all excellent. Mystery, romance......an intimate exploration of the experience of betrayal and ethics and loyalty.  I was enthralled from the first episode.
B008XG1X18|5.0|cant get enough of this! I can find the best stuff!I can share my interests with others and repin there's!
B0040HO16S|5.0|I just discovered this series on Prime.  It is an older mini series and doesn't have the polish and sophistication as Downton Abbey.  This in no way takes away from the enjoyment.<br /><br />The characters are funny, sad, loving, old and young, kind - each is interesting in their own way and the dynamics between the characters makes it a wonderful series to watch.<br /><br />It doesn't have the spectacular scenes that Downton does, but then it is an older series.  This doesn't take away from the enjoyment of the period settings, village, homes, etc.  I have just become so used to the new digital age of tv and movies.<br /><br />I am so glad there are many episodes to watch and I know I will be sad when there are no more.
B00000I41J|5.0|Does not grab you like a \\"Kind of Blue\\" or \\"In a Silent Way\\", but it is a popourri of different sounds. All ranging from a ten to an eight. It never fails you, but is more like a playlist than I wanted. Adderley and Miles together have always pulled me in. That is another factor, that I like, it is a good to excellent meshing of styles, that always pleases.The chemistry between Miles and Cannonball is like the Lennon McCartney of Jazz. I only wish these masters had done more material. It is a tremendous prelude to \\"Kind Of Blue\\" or I would have given it five stars. Maybe it is five stars, but \\"Kind Of Blue\\" is so well known, even outside of the jazz world. What a listen though. I bet you cannot listen to this album without tapping your feet, it is impossible!!!!.......and that is goooood!This CD has gradually become one of my favorites. It would definitely be in my top ten. It gets better the more I listen to it. I have heard it compared to the two classics listed above, and I did not agree. After repeated listening, I would have to place it right after \\"In a Silent Way\\". It gets that good after repeated listening, my next in line would be \\"Red Clay\\" by Freddie Hubbard. A CD that has truly been overlooked as a true classic. Classic to me is that Jazz that creeps into your soul and does not let go. I have listened to this CD constantly since I bought it about a month ago.
B000RLHDUM|5.0|Seen it before, got it on amazon cause it was cheap and available.  Watched it on date night with my girlfriend.  Great movie.
B007R3BB7Y|5.0|If you are a jazz fan, and like jazz you can sit and listen to, OR do anything requiring concentration, this CD has both of those attributes I like in traditional jazz. This could be what is now considered, &#34;New Age&#34;, except that the music itself is to extraordinary to really hold water. This man was a tortured soul, who seemed most comfortable when he was sitting in front of a keyboard. He railed against any kind of amplificatioutn, much less fusion. His music is pure, not simple in structure to the untrained mind, and it will not get you until about your third listen. Than he has got you in his grasp. Trickling tones, that invade your senses without being &#34;New Age&#34;. Far from it, because after the third or fourth time you listen to it, you realize how brilliant and innovative his jazz riffs really are. Clear, yet unique, rippling like molasses dripping off a picnic table in the wintertime. Take a chance on this, but beware of the addictive qualities contained within.
B00BF11STU|3.0|Movie was unrealistic. Main character's behavior was a tad on a psychotoc, obsessive compulsive side. The ending was a disappointment as well, just like her emotional lability. Overall, an ok moviewhich I would see once. Boring plot, predictable, nothing original.
B0091REZMW|4.0|fun and addictive good time waster. just wish it was easier to gett some diamonds. otherwise really good game. thanks
B00169N0BK|5.0|Not much to say really: It does what it's designed to do and it does it really well. I've used Datacolor spiders, Huey (poor) and more expensive X-Rite products -- I replaced an older i1 Photo Pro with this device and I'm completely happy. I've built 1/2 a dozen paper profiles since I received it and they're all excellent.<br /><br />This is a 5 star product.<br /><br />Joe
B007A4SDCG|5.0|I recommend this book to anyone who is trying to figure out what to do next.  Resistance has been what it has been about, but, thanks to Steven, not any more,
B000VHXD7O|4.0|Very good war movie. We should still use our lative tongue to make it harder to understand what we are saying.
B0063B2BNE|4.0|Still a good series although it can be a bit repetitive at times. I still enjoy it, but don't look forward to it like I once did.
B009LHFYNG|5.0|This is a superb textbook with outstanding examples and illustrations. The previous edition was outstanding, and this is even better. Chapter authors make explicit links between laboratory findings and clinical implications. Should be compulsory reading for psychiatry and neurology residents. Highly recommended for medical students.
B0044C3RB4|5.0|Love this series as it's something different that the norm. The characters blend well together and while watching it, I forget it's fiction!
0545128285|5.0|Harry Potter! Does anything else need to be said? I love this, once again JKR has a winner, even as an adult I can enjoy this book.
B0044CBMVG|4.0|Still a good series although it can be a bit repetitive at times. I still enjoy it, but don't look forward to it like I once did.
B003F3FJQO|4.0|I liked the series very much but this particular book seemed boring, as it was the middle of the storyline.
0744014549|5.0|As a fan of Lara's, this book has a lot of back story and wonderful artwork. Many of the pages are frame worthy, being near photographic in quality.
B00CEIGYAG|5.0|I am in love with this song, I waitied until midnight for the release. only thing I found wrong with it was that it was too short.
B00CEIGYAG|5.0|Anyone who appreciates music can recognize that Daft Punk is the pioneer of all things EDM. People can say all they want about how it is not as catchy as something by Avicii or Skrillex, but they also need to realize that their music wouldn't exist without Daft Punk
B00785P2QC|5.0|Good but you do run out of land fast and have to buy their stuff still it's a perfect game
B008Y2FRFO|4.0|This is an excellent way to get your coin game fix.  You have to wait for coins to regenerate (or buy them) and that keeps it fresh.
B001NZ1IGG|5.0|I love this album!! Andrew Wood was a great front man. I really believe that if not for his passing Stone Gossard & Jeff Ament  would not have been available to form Pearl Jam. Songs like This is Shangrila, Stardog  Champion, Stargazer & Crown if Thorns are brilliant. Not a bad song on the album.
B006OV7RQ4|5.0|dealer sent it  to me with god speed!!  that was seriously excellent!!  It was packaged in a very safely sensable manner.  i have to recommend this dealer!!
B009S33I68|5.0|I first saw Mel Gibson movie (awesome left me in tiers). When I saw this book listing knew I had to read it as a follow up. I've read many military histories, but none a clear reciting of timeline facts that held me page by page like a novel. Thank you all who served then and since.
B003UBTX6S|5.0|Great litte read, my wife was reading this and got me stated ...:} now i cant stop reading them im hooked
B009G3T01M|5.0|This is hip hop at its best. Good music with a profound message. I really love this artist's flow and technique.
B004UJAOLM|4.0|If you like the Bronte sisters, this is another good book in their style of writing.  The book goes back and forth in the history of a man who is now the current owner of Wuthering Heights.
B005P1YCNK|4.0|This book is an easy read and I would view it as a good &#34;refresher&#34;.  The ideas in this book are nothing new or revolutionary, but it is a good reminder of some great practices.
B00APUYWYA|5.0|I love this movie it is so funny I totally recommend this!!! I think everyone should watch this ;) you guys will love this
B003JTHXOK|5.0|I love the way Nicolas Sparks wrights! This book was suspenseful and romanticl It's a good book for a rainy day.
B00BEPVAV8|5.0|great graphics best game at the app store just like temple run but with cars gameplay is incrediable beach buggy blitz
B000I9X67M|5.0|why can't  i just rate it with the stars?i don't like being made to do this. it's just wrong. ty
B002N14GPE|5.0|=w= This movie was very good. The acting was superb along with just the right camera angles and even the shakiness of them some times. The thing I like most about it, is the fact that the trailers that I saw for it gave nothing about it away and left you with nothing more than an impression that there was a psychotic child.....not a full grown woman that had a rare hormone disorder.....XD I absolutely loved it.
B003O86FMW|5.0|I'm a forty year old dad and Iove this series! Great writing and pacing, tightly plotted. Ms. Collins is at top form.
B007SGLZP8|5.0|Great story.  I have read all of Grishams books and this one did not disappoint me.  Fast moving, exciting with lots of twists.
B00BWJARHO|3.0|I was concerned after seeing the trailer, and unfortunately did not find the movie to be any better. Too many liberties taken with the subject material. And while, yes, the book was written to be more simplistic than The Lord of The Rings (and thus, arguably, targeted to a younger audience), the whole goblin scene was just too childish. I'll probably watch the remaining movies, but I certainly won't be seeing them in theatres or paying a premium to do so.
B0095ZMMCK|3.0|The book centers around a cyber attack on the USA, and Jack Jr. trying to find out who's doing it. That's basically the whole story in a nutshell.<br /><br />I've read some of the other reviews, some saying things are not correct technically, some are saying it's not correct in details regarding cities, planes,etc some say it could never happen etc, well all of the previous statements maybe true but I read this type of book for enjoyment not research, so for me the previous statements really don't matter too much -  having said that - this is really not a bad book. It's a fast read, so don't let the 800 pgs scare you, some sections were extremely interesting, some others were a slow read.<br /><br /> I do think Clancy needs to up his game if he's going to charge over $9.99. I do not think this is worth the $14.99 price, so I strongly suggest you wait until the price drops. ( I received it as a gift).<br /><br />Short Review:<br />An ok read + current story line + read for enjoyment not info = read it but NOT @ $14.99 wait for a price drop
1476734941|5.0|Question:  for what percentage of homo sapiens time on this planet did the species have grocery stores?<br />Answer:  a very, very small percentage.<br />The implication is that for most of that time, mankind was subject to intermittent fast,<br />i.e., feast or famine.  We are their survivors and we have their bodies, which are<br />necessarily then well-accommodated to fasting.<br />Since I want to lose weight quickly, I have been doing the alternate day fasting regime<br />and I have lost 5 pounds in 2.5 weeks.  I feel much better and will continue.<br />Remember you do get 500/600 calories on the fast days.<br />For me, any hunger pangs passed quickly;  I felt great; I did my usual 1.5 mile run.<br />In other words, I can just live my life as usual on a fast day.<br />And the rewards are tremendous:  weight goes down, blood sugar goes down, you look better,<br />feel better, think better.  I wish I had known about this approach 20 years ago.<br /><br />It's well worth buying the book -- it has a lot of good information in it.<br />If you can find the corresponding 50min BBC/PBS TV show, that's good too.<br /><br />Finding a good reliable consistent scale is not easy in my experience.<br />The Epica Precision Pro Digital Body Fat Scale is pretty good.<br />I don't trust anything other than the weight though.<br />The Aviva Accuchek blood glucose meter is good and shows me that my blood glucose is decreasing.
B0001AVZA8|5.0|I think this is a great movie!!  I ordered it from Amazon because it was a great price.  Some of these older movies are getting hard to find in the stores.  Funny, though, cause this movie isn't that old.  Anyway, it was shipped really fast.  It's so convenient to order these movies from Amazon.  They are cheaper than some stores, and they are delivered right to your mailbox.  It couldn't be any easier than that!!  I order more movies from Amazon than anything else.
B0064MPXFA|5.0|Give your brain a treat - much more stimulating than watching grown women throw drinks at each other and try to pull out each others hair extensions out.  There's great tension between the characters and the story lines are fantastic. I don't think there's any better television out there.
B00BEYYEE4|1.0|I saw this weak film in the theaters. It was extremely boring and predictable. It is a passer for sure
B0064X7FVE|5.0|Down loaded an used with kindle. To my surprise worked well even on commercial aircraft. It also indicated position of aircraft.
B00CEIGYAG|5.0|Daft punk fans your wait is finally over! 2013 is the year of Daft Punk! This song is incredibly funky and original in a &#34;market&#34; that has been lacking recently
B004ZMWUCU|5.0|Outstanding read. The title drew me to the novel and I never let loose until the very end. McKenna wrote a fantastic story that will entertain everyone!
B00CFEJGO0|3.0|a few gun haters gathered around to make an episode about demonizing hunting and the outdoors. this series seems interesting so far but I don't see any relation between any of the development that reminds me of Hannibal lector. the actor portraying him lacks the scary resolve of Anthony Hopkins because with one look at Anthony you know terrible things are going on in his head and that scares you because he is so smug.
B0042J6VUS|3.0|Too small for a droid Razr but fine for an Iphone. Far from fancy but holds the phone. Dont expect much
B0013TXA5Y|5.0|I personally thought this book deserved a 5-star review. It had a very original and creative plot, and all the characters have realistic personalities.<br /><br />I'm seeing a lot pf people saying that the chacters are ripoffs from Harry Potter. I don't understand this at all. While there may be some similarities, there are certainly differences, too.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|When I finally got hold of it, I began reading immediately. If you're like me, you will become totally obsessed very soon. I still can't get over how great this book is. It is addictive if you can handle the violence. Have a great first read, to anyone who is looking to buy it!
B009UX2YAC|5.0|Love the game i would tell anyone who plays temple run to get any of the subway surfers this is so addictive so if you crave action purchase this it is free just go to ur app store and type it in
B00AKL1XPU|5.0|It's fun and the in purchase apps not too annoying. If you like animal rescues, this game is for you,!
B007R3AZNK|5.0|After seeing Joe Bonamassa at the Byron Bay Blues Fest in 2011 I started buying his cd's.  I thought Blues deluxe was really good, his first album with Beth Hart is a must have and so is this.  Great music.  Joe's singing is getting better and the last song with Jimmy Barnes is a knockout.  Any body who loves great electric blues will love this - top class.
0307341577|3.0|I loved Flynns other novels so I finally decided to read dark places. The book started off excellent. Flynn is an excellent whodunit writer. You don't really like the characters but u tolerate their imperfections because let's face it, you know a Patty or a Michelle or a Runner. Somewhere within the last 60 pages you can kind of see where the book is going (if you've been paying close attention) and you're hoping you're wrong because it really makes no sense. So you &#34;speed read&#34;, desperately trying to figure out this family mystery and &#34;sigh&#34; you are right, and you are disappointed. I won't say it's predictable per se, but Flynn leaves you enough clues for this puzzle. There was just way too much going on for this to be believable! I know it's fiction but, the circumstances were so unlikely I actually chuckled at some parts. Ben is so detached and unmoved toward some characters you wonder if he should in a psych ward instead of jail, along with his sister Libby and some of those crazy women who are fans of Ben (come to think of it every one in the book is nuts!) I would recommend this read if you're bored on a flight. Otherwise read sharp objects or gone girl.
B0079KKJ3M|5.0|I want to buy the soundtrak of this movie too. Is it available? I didn't find it. If is possible in CD. Thanks

B007BVOEPI|5.0|I was captivated from the first episode. The show draws you in and keeps in anticipating what will happen in the next episode. Watched the whole season one in one weekend.
B0001VV1GK|5.0|My 4 yr old granddaughter just loved it.  She is fascinated with cars and has a great imagination.<br />She used to use cardboard boxes to make garages for her trucks and cars.<br />Now she has a real garage and plays for hours.

B00B8M4IMK|5.0|I haven't had much luck with car chargers. They always seem to stop working fairly quickly. I've stopped using them and just resorted to making sure my device is fully charged before leaving the house. I didn't have high hopes for this charger either until I was amazed at how fast it charged my daughter's iPod Touch 5th generation. I don't know if we just got lucky but my daughter's iPod was completely dead before we got into the van. We plugged it in and her iPod Touch was completely charged in less than 15 minutes. I'm being completely honest. She was like mom that was quick, and I'm like what was quick? She then stated that her iPod Touch had finished charging. I was amazed so this car charger definitely gets kudos for how fast it charges devices. I also tested it on my iPad 2, Android phone, iPod Touch 4th generation and an iPhone 4S. Each device charged fairly quickly. I also like the fact that the car charger worked up front and behind the driver's side. I have a panel of outlets in my van to plugin devices such as Playstation etc. My kids riding in the back can choose to use either the electrical outlet or the AC Adapter outlet. I have a 2012 Chrysler Town & Country. I would recommend getting this charger especially since it has the dual slots for Android and iOS devices. It also charges the devices fairly quickly which I'm very happy about!
B001NLKZUA|5.0|Shocking and intriguing, this book is an awesome read!!  There's just the right amount of romance and action...I love this series
B00BDZV9M4|5.0|Sounds good its perfect and the price was great no problems my son and me love dat we got it for such a great deal at amozon
1593272774|5.0|A great collection of simple projects that can be put together for big projects.  My 9 year old spent hours going through different types of latches, hinges, and little machines.
B003JTHXOK|4.0|A good love story with a little suspense and a really surprise ending that made you smile and say I would have never guessed
B00AB7HESI|4.0|They love it so much that they keep telling me hopefully &#34;Mama, you have to READ and SPELL with this game&#34;  I am not a huge fan of video games, and they know that purported educational value will be a plus on their side. My younger son asked for a 'smartboard' during the game and got a board with a graduation cap, so it's funny too.  He also mis-spelled something and got a hilarious animal instead, so there may be some merit to their claims after all.  They encountered it at their school library where it was an allowed game for reading and spelling time for first graders.
B00BF11STU|4.0|There were some gritty, harsh scenes in the movie but I thought the acting was very good and the story was believable.
B002LII6KA|4.0|very nice complete anthology of the matrix...if you are a fan you are going to thoroughly enjoy this collection..it's awesome !!!
B00B5HQKNI|3.0|Lame subject retiring bond! Not up to par with other bond movies. Was movie just made for money using Bond name?
0446554995|5.0|Oh my goodness! I finally have my hands on Two Grave and it's begins with a bang.<br />Douglas Preston and Lincoln Child are my two favorite writers above all else.<br />Read the trilogy - they go great with each other!
B005OCFHHK|5.0|The is so nice.  We had the earlier movies on VHS.  I'm very happy to have them all on Blu-Ray.
B005LAIIJY|5.0|Outrageous, funny, violent, absurd, brilliant, insane, stunning, over-the-top...  what else ya got?  A one-of-a-kind Tarantino masterpiece that I consider his best work since \\"Pulp Fiction\\".  An amazing job by the entire cast and crew - and oh, that soundtrack - how eclectic can you get?  Also filled with an abundance of QT 'hommages' to films, TV shows, directors and genres.  And don't miss the last line of the movie, after the credits - perfect!
B009IJJ5B4|5.0|if you enjoy your main characters being geniuses with issues that are severe and they view as acceptable then this incarnation of Sherlock Holmes might be the one for you.<br />New York detective drama, comparable to CSI or NCIS with, as far as i'm concerned, better actors and more interesting case evolution.
B0031RAOW8|5.0|Love it. Never though a movie would mąkę me cry like it did. If you have a shiba or a Akti this movie will touch at your hart a little more.
B0099Y2MYK|5.0|Once your involved in this series, you can't get enough!  Wonderful cast, great scenery and costumes.  What a wonderful writer, he is!
B00AREIAI8|5.0|This is a great game for the whole family!! Great graphics and realistic horse behaviour and movement. Lots of mini games and challenges to keep you entertained for hours!
B00AA0TZTW|5.0|I really thought this was another remix of Jimi's stuff which is worth a listen to me anytime but damn the sound was wonderful and to hear some songs by THE MAN that i never heard before was worth it's weight in gold !
B009IF8CH6|5.0|I love it! It was easy to buy and easy to download to my Kindle. Downloading the full season on Amazon was much cheaper than buying a full season, say, at Walmart. I love the Kindle store an the options it gives you!
B00AZRBLHO|5.0|I have worked in organizations that mimic how poorly IT could be managed and if half the suggestions in this book were implemented there I would probably still be working there. If you could get an executive in your company to read this book then you'll be better for it.
B005VPRDAY|5.0|Small kit but its nice. My niece played with it for hours. SO its a pretty good deal better than a store
1451668945|5.0|In \\"Daddy's Gone A Hunting,\\" Mary Higgins Clark has woven an intricate plot where characters and events, that are seemingly unrelated, intertwine to create the mystery and suspense I've come to expect from her novels. As a reader, the book kept me eagerly turning the pages and, as a writer, I have the deepest admiration for her ability to create and sustain suspense from the first page until the end of the book. I highly recommend \\"Daddy's Gone A Hunting.\\" Mary Higgins Clark truly is \\"The Queen of Suspense.\\"
B001E75QH0|5.0|Good action stories, good movies. Fun to watch over again 5 years down the road. Hary Potter series is good to.
B00992CF6W|5.0|This game is amazing, but it doesn't have everything from the pc or xbox version, but is still a fantastic game
B00B2V66VS|5.0|I LOVE IT!!! Its an awesome game I'm hooked for hours. I've been waiting for tuis ssequel its a lot more advanced the graphics are outstanding this time and its just so fun to play. I will always love the temple run series
B00AQ3K8IU|5.0|This book was absolutely amazing. I started reading it just knowing it was a love story. The story line in great. I love the friendships and relationships in the book. I  don't want to say too much and ruin the book but i would highly recommend it.
B007ZXK08C|5.0|one of my favourite books I've read for a long time. I was obsessed by it. I thought about it when I wasn't reading it. It was the first thing I thought about when i woke up in the morning. I had to have a break from reading after I finished it because it was so intense and so awesome. Didn't like the ending, just because it wasn't what I wanted to happen, but it's still amazeballs.
B00ATDOVNK|5.0|I loved it. It was exciting and fun and so intense. I loved it. I would recommend it to anyone who likes fun finding object games.
B005K0HDGE|5.0|I have never been a big reader of Stephen King's books, but this is my second of his to read (after The Stand).  I've always thought of his books as being mostly of the horror genre.  I heard great things about this one, so I decided to give it a try.<br /><br />This book was captivating, even as such a long novel, and it wove in historical details that fit the story so well that I had to put the book aside to go read up on some of the actual events that happened during this time.<br /><br />I highly recommend this book, and think you will enjoy every page of it!
B001KDQ4KQ|5.0|I loved the intertwined love story and unexpected turns. I couldn't put it down. Makes me think of a love that everyone wishes they had. I will be recommending this book to everyone.
B00BQUUH7E|2.0|Have to reboot game if am opiton is not chosen quickly... Screen will not allow you to tap anything.... Kindle fire and galaxy s2...  Works if you very around this annoying bug.  Hoping for a fix to give Bete review.
B00BSBVLF8|2.0|Better to see live than on a TV screen. My wife and I rarely stop watching a movie. This oone we BOTH agreed to stop!
030758836X|3.0|The premise sounded interesting so I picked it up. I love a good mystery, whodunit, and the more twists and turns the better. I am not a fan of the he said, she said, back and forth narrative, but it somehow works in this book. The book started out strong, and just when my interest started to wane a bit, a good twist would come along.. ah, gasp, oh my ....but the last 1/4 or so of the book was a letdown.. I know it's fiction, but it was way out there.. It really fizzled for me towards the end. It had so much potential ,but came up short. I honestly don't think I liked any character in this book.. well maybe one or two of the detectives working the case. I didn't like Nick, or Amy or \\"Go. The Amazing Amy storyline was too much...
B002KEZ96Y|5.0|You either love this movie, or you probably don't &#34;get it.&#34;  Great cast of characters, Jeff Bridges at his best.  Make yourself a white russian and enjoy!
B000SMWUPS|5.0|The items look like they will do the trick b ut I havn't got to use them much as there is lots of snow outside and going for strollers rides are very cold.  thanks a lot nat. P. S i purchsed this item a amazon
B00003CXAA|5.0|What else can you say? It's the godfather! Classic mob movie for any body who does not own these needs to get it!
B00AB7HESI|4.0|i love this game but the fact that you have to pay about a dollar more for updates kinda stinks other than that its absolutely amazing
B0074VA2T2|1.0|Really wanted this app, but it did not work on my Droid phone. I downloaded this app twice, but when I try to use it, it kept saying force close. I deleted the app. from my phone.
B004UHL9EK|5.0|The amount of granularity allowed with this apps timers, alarms, triggers, and stopwatches, is excellent!  it's simple to use as well.
B008CRC506|4.0|I have always been a Marilyn Monroe fan.  I was surprised when a friend talked me into watching the second season of Smath.  I enjoyed it so much I had to buy the First Season which I enjoyed and watched it all in one sitting!
B001NBEWN6|4.0|The authors writing style is enjoyable to read. The story really engrossed you. Making you feel intimate with the characters. A very good novel.
1616614609|5.0|Got this on a whim and actually had fun with it.  Game with friends who constantly try new and interesting things to varying degrees of enjoyment, then this might be the game for you.  I personally loved playing this game with friends.  It's a mix of cyberpunk and card games where you play against each other to make the cred.  Takes a little bit to get started, but once you do, it goes pretty quickly.  For 2-players, but there are things online for modifying it to include more people and how to do so.  Not like standard CCG (Customizable Card Games), like Magic: The Gathering and such, but can expand with expansion packs.  Recommend this for people you like card games and strategy games or just looking for an alternative to the CCGs out there.
B0099Y2MYK|4.0|Better than the second series, which almost lost me. The storytellers keep everything moving at a cracking pace, and I watched it all within a week.
B00AREIAI8|3.0|its good but when training for competitions it needs to explain that you don't keep tapping the button you have to wait THEN tap the button when it goes into the blue part.
B00BGIC2J2|3.0|Not really worth it.ok movie could have been better..  rent something else, pass this movie and find another selection. G
B008Y2FRFO|3.0|Haven't played it much, so guess I am not to interested in it.  Will give it more of a chance and see.
B004SBULWE|5.0|Great! Does as advertised and helps save my battery life.you would be amaze at how many apps still run on the background
B00785P2QC|5.0|Fun game . Lots to do. Can waste hours on this one. G5 games are usually good. Recommend to others of all ages
B00AU15HPC|4.0|Loving all the reviews, positive and negative. They give quite a clear picture.<br />I got the album as a birthday present a couple of weeks ago. Here's my view.<br />I love Justin's songs of all the Moodies. His solo albums though can be patchy. Do I care? No, I can live with getting one or two good songs.<br />On this album, the song \\"The Western Sky\\" is a pearl. It is a quiet and restrained piece of music. Turn it up to admire the guitar work, the strings, the vocals. The guy is in his 60s, his voice is not what it was. But, it is still lovely to listen to. Turn up \\"The Western Sky\\" and listen--there's a surprising amount of power there.<br />The album is in 3 parts. There are songs close to his Moody Blues and solo albums. Other than Western Sky, none of them struck me at first. For one thing, the words don't always seem to fit the music. Listen to the song \\"In the beginning\\" whose lyrics start, appropriately enough \\"in the beginning\\". Are there are enough beats in the music for all those syllables? But, dang it, now that I've listened to the album in the car for a week...all of these songs are pulsating in my brain. On The Road To Love, an up tempo rocker is another one that grows on you. But I'm still getting a lot of pleasure from soaking myself in all of them.<br />The second part of the album are the country music songs. They don't all work for me, but I am thrilled he is doing it. Justin has a perfect voice for country--he'll sing a word with a catch in his voice, almost a sob. Please keep this up! Some of the country style songs are original, others have been sung on other solo albums as rock ballads.<br />The third part of the album includes an extended techno version of Out There Somewhere. This is unlikely to be a favorite of old-time fans, but it works great while driving along. Justin tells a story that they danced around to this music after each day's sessions and eventually decided to include it in the album. This is fine by me--there is a LOT of music on this album. Just counting the familiar music you get your money's worth. The country style bits and techno are a bonus. I am also approving that Justin is still an artist, still growing, still changing, still trying new things.<br /><br />Check out the YouTube versions (Michael Davison's Western Sky has some lovely images), download the Moody Blues app to your iPad and come to your own conclusion. As Mike Pinder might say: I've said my piece and I'm leaving it all up to you.
B005NFVZTM|5.0|Great sound and view I really love it; make my trip more pleasant. On my way out of town.<br />l will recommend
B008MG1E4A|5.0|I loved this book and could not put it down, my brother recommended it to me. I would recommend this book to anyone.
B0070Y46UY|5.0|Exciting-I couldn't stop reading!  I was sure this was a true story but still believe it all Could have happened!
B00B7G3NFU|5.0|So well done -- humor infused with sadness and longing.  The acting is believable, and his story is inspirational.  You will be glad you rented this one.
B0055SWM08|5.0|quell is a wonderful puzzle game with great soothing music. i can play for an hour. it gets complicated enougb to be challenging and allows tips when stuck on a level. great for all ages.
B00005KAQP|5.0|love this movie had a great cast and a very good story enough said, maggie smith was great as the head nun
B009AMAGXK|5.0|I know it is hard to separate the review of a movie and that of its literary counterpart. I do my best to look at the as a separate story, because in most cases they are. Beautiful Creature is a great book and I do wish that the movie could have instilled a little more of the key points from the book into it's big screen adaptation, but as a movie I really enjoyed it. There was a great cast to the movie and some great scenery throughout the movie. If your going to harshly pick about the differences between the book and movie, this probably will not be the movie for you. However, if you intend on watching it as more of a cinematic adventure then your in for a good time. It was a entertaining movie and was not a waste of money in my opinion. There were a lot of good parts of the movie and on that alone makes it at least a 4 star, but add in the on camera chemistry between the lead characters as well as the supporting cast I boost it up to a 4 1/2 star (Unfortunately Amazon doesn't do half stars so I'm gonna round up to a 5). I would love to give it a full 5 star, but I want to be as accurate as possible and unfortunately it did lack some in the plot department. It is an understandable plot, but it seems kind of rushed in places and that can detract from the overall experience. All in all it's a really good movie, hence I say MOVIE, if you looking the book it's located else where. Yes, they are the same overall story, but two different worlds just like most every adaptation. So try not to get hung up on the differences and take the movie for what it is. If the writers of the book didn't take the initiative in getting things changed then it's not meant to be one in the same, instead they allowed for someone else to have their own interpretation of their beloved book. If it's alright with them them it's alright for me.<br /><br />If your looking for a great way to spend a little down time and be entertained, then I would recommend buy or at least renting Beautiful Creatures when it comes out.<br /><br />If your looking for a big screen version of an excellent book, you may want to rent it when available, although I wouldn't get too caught up on all the changes. You might be better off finding something else to watch if your going to ruin the movie for yourself.<br /><br />I'll be ready to re-watch it when it comes out and maybe you will be too.
B00AR3WD8W|5.0|You can listen to any CD by Elvis The King, and you will never get disapointed.  This concert was a sensation in 1973, and still is.  Now it's a double, which means twice as much good music.
B00B769XB8|5.0|Hansel & Gretel: Witch Hunters was a pretty good re-imagining to a fairy tale. Even though there were aspects of the original story that was not strictly for children this was a great change. I had my doubts going into this movie, but by the time the credits rolled I was excited and looking forward to another. It had a nice selection of action and weapons along with some great actors and actresses. It was all in all a great movie and one I will definitely buy when it comes out. There was not a who heck of a lot to the overall plot and story, but it was enough to move along the story pretty fluidly. It a fun and entertaining movie that is well worth the time and money.
B000002AGN|4.0|My Daughter plays CD more than me. I purchased for my Husband and he has a struggle just to listen.
B003O86FMW|5.0|Love love love!<br />I have never been so on edge during a whole book like I was with this one. The whole book had me so warped up in it!
B003K1EYM6|4.0|Originally when I attempted to transfer photos from my Sony CyberShot, I received an error message on the iPad 2 saying the connected USB device required too much power so I moved on to the SD card option; the SD card reader did not recognize my card (Sony memory stick ProDuo) so I thought this adapter was useless. After fiddling with my camera and the different options, I came across a USB power setting and switched it to off then attempted the transfer with the USB adapter again -- it worked fantastically! Transferred 1 GB worth of photos in a minute or so. Great product, I just wish the SD reader worked (but that could be that my card is incompatible)!
B0091REZMW|5.0|love this game...cool features and new levels ...seasonal challenges and helping friends makes it enjoyable and social...would definitely recommend to friends
B00846REIS|5.0|Really enjoyed reading this book.  Can't wait for the next ones!  I have already read them more than once.  Addictive!
B000PKX2KA|5.0|For an inexpensive GPS receiver, this little unit is a dandy. Installation was easy on a Win 7 laptop, the included software configures one of your USB ports as a serial port. I'm using it with DeLorme Topo North America. Inside the house, it nails our position from a cold start in just a couple minutes. Much faster outside. Has the excellent Sirf III chip set, which is no longer the most sensitive GPS receiver available, but still works well. A bargain at less than $30!
B009GX6TQ6|5.0|This is a biased review.<br /><br />I love NCIS LA and have thoroughly enjoyed this season. In my humble opinion, this is the best season so far.
B000FBFN1U|5.0|I loved this book so much. I cried at the red wedding party and was completely shocked at other parts. Definitely would recommend this book!!!
B001ANSSDC|5.0|This book started out a bit confusing for me.  It's written differently from any book I have ever read before, but before long, I was experiencing life through the eyes of Pat Peoples.  I thoroughly enjoyed the book and appreciate being able to live inside the mind of someone like Pat and his friend Tiffany.
B00008G8LG|3.0|Color on the DVD was not clear at times.  Waves of color i some scenes.  It has such beautiful scenery and I love the story.  Ann Watkins
B005FFW46S|5.0|Terry Pratchett delivers again. Nice to see more of young Sam and Lady Sybil. Vetinari has some interesting, if minor, development in this as well. The take on goblins is well done.
B00A11AN6O|5.0|Very easy to use.  Uploads pics fast.  Easy to save to device, or leave them in the cloud.  Love it.  Have already recommended to a friend.
0671510991|4.0|Reading this now for war college.  It is a fascinating enough read that I bought a copy for myself (to keep).  Kissinger is a master at reading between the lines...which is a &#34;must&#34; for understanding international diplomacy.  This book is a fantastic introduction to US history in international engagement (although note that chapters aren't necessarily US-centric...US hasn't always been a hegemony or one pole of a bipolar world).  My main criticism is that sometimes Kissinger goes a bit too &#34;Bismarckian&#34;...or sometimes isn't realistic enough.  E.g., his views in Teddy Roosevelt seem a bit forced, and his views on UK appeasement of Hitler seem a bit harsh.  But definitely worth the food for thought for readers interested in international engagement.
B008JFUO36|5.0|There exists an ache deep within each of us, longing to know who we are, where we came from, and why we were created. Deep down in the core of our being, we know there is something more. Like Jack Harper, we do not want to simply live a purposeless life as the security repair man; a sterile life of a thousand repetitions.    In this sense, Jack typifies all of humanity in this movie. In him, we find the war waging within each of us. Do we allow ourselves to forget who we are? Do we give in to sin, and allow it to dull our intellect, even our memory? How many of us have lost our joy, our vigor for life. How far we have fallen indeed, and how sad and cynical we have become. Earth really *is* devastated. Yet there is still hope for humanity, in compassion, in love. In this way, Jack serves as a figure of all humanity, who's self-revelation marks a new beginning for mankind.    Yes, I know, I read into movies too much.
B007BVOEPI|5.0|I just started through the series a couple weeks ago and am definitely hooked! Lots of things going on, lots of characters, great locations/sets. Definitely recommend this one!
B005LAII1C|4.0|This is definitely a guy's movie, but it really has some funny moments and Ted's animation is outstanding.  Not recommended for your girlfriend or wife!!
B009YP9L7U|5.0|Loved it couldn't put it down! So romantic like a fairy tale! But hot and sexy at the Sam e time!
B002NZK5QY|2.0|We really liked the film &#34;Amadeus&#34; and wanted to watch it through till the end.  Unfortunately, the disc we received was of very poor quality and cut off after 143 minutes, so we can't see the end.  If Amazon wants to send a replacement, so that we get a chance to see the end, that would be great.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|I think it is the best horse game for kindle and I think anyone who likes horses should definitely get this app.
B00992CF6W|5.0|You must test this game because if you want a cheaper minecraft then you should get this game. I love it an  so those my brother
034580404X|5.0|I am not a big fan of reading and was coaxed by several friends to give this series a try.  I have to say it was one of the easiest books to read.  Besides the obvious, I felt the story was very well written.  I felt such a connection to Ana because I have recently felt the same feelings as she had in a relationship with someone also very mercurial.  I found myself crying with her several times through the story and also laughing and agreeing with her inner goddess.  After I was finished with the series I found myself missing it, so I just started re-reading it!  I can't wait for the 4th book - Inner Goddess!
B00AHG9KYE|4.0|This should not be the end of the story but Sir Clarke is no longer with us to finish it. Oh that he and Ray Kurzweil were right and that he had a Braincap and tablet.
B005K01VZS|5.0|Like all of Mitch Albom's books that I have read, there is a strong moral message of how faith can win  over ambivalence and ignorance. Although,it reads like a novel it is based on a true story. One of the most meaningful statements in the book which I will quote here is: \\"If you could pack for heaven, this was hou you'd do it, touching everything and taking nothing\\". Albom shows that coming from poverty is no sin and that a sincere apology strengthens one's individual faith and resolve to reverse his/her impoverished conditions. Excellent Read!
B007TNS6JI|5.0|If you love a hack and slash as much as the next person, this game is for you. Cool upgrades and easy game play.
B00821OX98|5.0|I like this show because there are many good lessons for how to survive in the case of a major disaster that wipes out life as we know it and forces us to learn how to survive with each other.  I like the fact that two unlikely partners learn to respect each other's strengths and come to actually like each other.  I like that one woman positively influences the group with her faith.  Then there are some realistic lousy things that go on too in the group of humanity that has survived.
B002DOSBMK|5.0|I loved this book I couldn't put it down it catches it attention straight from the beginning and dissent let it go
B0036EH3XE|5.0|A very enjoyable series touching on friendship, mortality, destiny, choices, love, hate, mistrust and confusion.  Yes, all of those and much more.
1582406723|5.0|AS A HUGE FAN OF THE AMC SERIES SINCE IT FIRST PREMIERED I WAS A LITTLE SLOW TO READ THE GRAPHIC NOVELS ,I ONLY ORDERED THE FIRST 3 VOLUMES A COUPLE OF WEEKS AGO AND THEY SET AROUND FOR A FEW DAYS AFTERWARDS BUT THEN I PICKED UP VOL. 1 AND I WAS INSTANTLY HOOKED ,ITS INTERESTING SEEING THE DIFFERENT WAYS THAT THE STORY LINES GO AND ONCE I STARTED READING I COULDNT PUT THEM DOWN I READ ALL THREE IN A COUPLE OF DAYS ,I NOW HAVE EVERY OTHER VOLUME ON ORDER FROM AMAZON ,CANT WAIT TO SEE WHERE THEY GO, A TREAT FOR ME SINCE THE SERIES HAS WRAPPED UP THE CURRENT SEASON.
B001FW58D6|5.0|Being a huge LOST fan, I was drawn to Fringe solely because of JJ Abrams. If you thought LOST was awesome, my God, watch Fringe and LOST will soon become a distant memory. This show is mind-blowing and so brilliantly done complete with fanstastic casting, amazing scripts, phenomenal directing and producing! I don't think there has ever been or ever will be a TV show as good as Fringe! It's that outstanding! The storyline is beyond creative. There are never unanswered questions for long (like in LOST--how frustrating!). The writers return again and again as the storyline flows through years and universes and back again. Very well-done, very!<br /><br />My favorite character is Walter Bishop played by John Noble. Fringe would not be the show it is without John Noble! I think I love him. I want Walter to be my grandfather! He is a hilarious character even though he doesn't mean to be! John's acting is so astounding that I'm constantly left wondering why he hasn't won numerous acting awards and graced countless magazine covers! He may just be one of the best actors in the history of film and TV! Perhaps if he were 20 years younger and in his prime, he would get the recognition he deserves for his incredible talent! I hope to see him cast again and again from this point on! The rest of the main cast (Anna Torv, Joshua Jackson, Jasika Nicole, Lance Reddick and Blair Brown) are all outstanding actors and actresses as well.<br /><br />Joshua Jackson really proved himself a talented actor! At first, I wasn't sold. I was a Dawson's Creek fan when I was younger and it was hard to see him as anyone other than Pacey! He seemed to be very similar in character to Pacey at the start of Season 1. A few episodes in and it was like \\"Pacey, who?\\". As the seasons carried on, Joshua became Peter! Anna Torv....Wow! First of all, what a beautiful woman! Hard to take her seriously as an FBI/Fringe agent being so pretty like that! I will say I wasn't too sure about her at first either but as the Fringe plot thickened (and multiple Olivias show up), all of a sudden, we get to see just how talented Anna really is! Then...then she's William Bell! OMG! I love those scenes! Jasika Nicole...I grew to love her as Astrid! Her warm, loving and compassionate support for Walter and her role in the team....I'm totally sold! Blair Brown was outstanding as Nina! I love her voice and beguiling looks. She always had me on the edge of my seat wondering what she was up to! That's hard to convey in facial expressions alone. She totally nailed it!  Lance Reddick...wish they built his character up a bit more but he was fantastic as Phillip Broyles. He had that \\"look\\" in his eyes that really brought Phillip to life.<br /><br />I'm truly just so sad to see Fringe end that I have held off on watching the last season until now. I don't want to say goodbye to such a fantastic story and cast. I plan to buy all the seasons on DVD and any books I can get my hands on. I have never done that before with any other show or any movie so my out-of-character fanaticism speaks for itself! I look forward to the day that I forget most of the show (will that ever happen!?) and watch the episodes all over again, maybe even with my kids at my side! This show made television history!the Fringe plot thickened (and multiple Olivias show up), all of a sudden, we get to see just how talented Anna really is! Then...then she's William Bell! OMG! I love those scenes! Jasika Nicole...I grew to love her as Astrid! Her warm, loving and compassionate support for Walter and her role in the team....I'm totally sold! Blair Brown was outstanding as Nina! I love her voice and beguiling looks. She always had me on the edge of my seat wondering what she was up to! That's hard to convey in facial expressions alone. She totally nailed it!  Lance Reddick...wish they built his character up a bit more but he was fantastic as Phillip Broyles. He had that \\"look\\" in his eyes that really brought Phillip to life.<br /><br />I'm truly just so sad to see Fringe end that I have held off on watching the last season until now. I don't want to say goodbye to such a fantastic story and cast. I plan to buy all the seasons on DVD and any books I can get my hands on. I have never done that before with any other show or any movie so my out-of-character fanaticism speaks for itself! I look forward to the day that I forget most of the show (will that ever happen!?) and watch the episodes all over again, maybe even with my kids at my side! This show made television history!
B00BB8RKH6|4.0|Morgan freeman does his usual outstanding job acting.  Movie is a cliff hanger and will have you sitting on your edge of your seat.  The story line is thought provoking dealing with alcoholism and finally facing the reality you are an alcoholic.
B008DVJMAW|4.0|Great southern rock. I had never heard of this band until I saw them on Itunes. I liked enough their stuff that I bought the cd. Glad I did..they are pretty cool.
B0016KJKIG|5.0|Didn't realize the leatherman came with this case so now I have a spare.  Oh-well, it could come in handy.  Keep it as backup.  It is a good product, especially if you've lost the original.
0385349947|5.0|I purchased this for three people in my office. I think it is a must-have for all women in the workplace!! It's inspiring!!
B00867GHS8|5.0|I have always loved this movie and was excited to see it in 3D! It is a great family movie. The 3D was excellent and made the movie fun to watch again.
B001ANSSDC|3.0|I like this very much; showed how we need to be &#34;careful for what we wish for&#34;......sometimes the alternate is right in frront of us.  I think perhaps the movie was better.  Didn't see it.
B006H5120E|5.0|This movie was good and 3D made it better! I watch this movie at least once a year and am glad to have the 3D version in my collection. The 3D looks great!
B000URWYTS|5.0|Give you an insight about this very famous and talented man and the workings of his mind.  It kept me reading and I just hated to see it end; although the ending was a surprise to me.  I would highly recommend reading this one.
B005S9EKCW|5.0|Have always loved the music from this story. Already have two versions of this in concert. This movie really shows the principal character as they should be. A real treat.
B003YL4LYI|5.0|I've read the first four volumes straight through and never<br />tire of them!  I would recommend starting from the beginning<br />volume if you're interested in getting the full tale of &#34;Game of Thrones.&#34;
B000002GYR|4.0|I gave this as a gift to my Son In Law and he loved it.  He is a big Tom Waits fan.  Can't wait to give him other Tom Wait items.
B000FCKGPC|5.0|Excellent, just like the previous volumes of the story!<br />Start from the beginning volume if you're interested<br />in this tale; otherwise, too confusing.
B006OOHYIC|4.0|I like this puzzle - it keeps you thinking.  There are not a huge number of levels, so it does not take too long to complete it, which is a downside.
B005GFPZYK|4.0|It's an easy read, but it something you do  want to read for entertainment. It's graphic and accurately illustrates the challenges in was.
B004ZMWUCU|5.0|Great character descriptions. Also liked how past and present were woven together. Really enjoyed this book.  Almost hate to leave these folks behind
B001ANSSDC|5.0|I was captivated with this book from beginning to end.  It was hard to put down. I had the desire to read the book before I saw the movie and was not disappointed for a second.
B005GFPZYK|5.0|Very good. I thought his story was just amazing and some of the things he did were crazy. Amazing troops we have.
B00BMVTS1S|5.0|love that we were surprised to find this among the videos that were able to be watched WAY before payperview or DVD purchase, just a few clicks of the Wii remote and my password and we were set for the evening, my brother hadn't been able to watch it yet and was hoping he could still catch it in theaters but we were able to surprise him and watch it all comfy at my house!
B00AA0TZTW|4.0|I down loaded the Mp3 versions to try them out and was surprised how good the sound and the guitar work Jimi did in these songs. All in all a good find for the die hard Hendrix fan. Would I consider it a monumental event ??  \\"No\\", but like all the other artist who have passed away recently Ill take what ever they can find and enjoy it.
B00BI5IXL4|5.0|The picure quality on the streaming was excellent, no hitches or buffering problems. The video was clear and the audio was too, I was able to purchase this without having to worry about DVD scratches interfering with future enjoyment and I didn't have to buy a blueray player to get a great pic.
B001MTENOC|5.0|I'm not even sure where to begin. This is perhaps one of the most important books ever to be written or read. This book could literally save humanity if everyone read it and understood the implications.
B004ZMWUCU|5.0|This is a well-written story with all the joy and sadness of the human condition. I'll look for more by McKenna.
B0091REZMW|5.0|its so good and obsessive best game ever!!! is a great hidden objects game ...... if you don't enjoy this game soo much your beyond crazy and insane
B00CDT41RY|1.0|I want my money back. If this continue I will cancel my prime subscription. You have to be more attentive to technical details. You have to make refunds of digitalis purchase easier.
B009FZFONO|5.0|WD is getting better and better.Character are getting deeper and the show has great potential.IF the writers don't go corporate and smarmy, if the cast stays motivated, and if the story line opens up this might be magnificent.  But we need a deeper look at what happened.  We need a bigger view of what's out there in the world now.  We need a broader perspective and better practical input of what is going on. Those things can be the difference between clever and great.
B007FEFLTO|5.0|Haven't finished yet, but it's as wonderful as Book 1.  Amazing how Follett is able to weave the characters of all the different countries together.
B005S9EK5Y|3.0|I confess to being a Les Mis addict so I enjoy everything relating to it . I have read the book twice and am now on its third reading . I own several versions of the movie , both the 10th and 25th anniversary DVD's of the musical and have seen 3 live performances . None of the movies or musicals can really do justice to Hugo's masterpiece , one of the great works of fiction . They all concentrate on the confrontation between Valjean and Javert i.e.justice v the law and the allied redemption and forgiveness and tend to ignore to some degree the real message of the book , the plight of the &#34; miserable ones &#34; , hence the title . However one must not be too harsh in judgement . This DVD is the movie of the musical and not of the book , so must be judged as such . The definitive musical standard was set by the Dream Cast assembled for the 10 th anniversary concert .This version does not attain that standard , it would have been a welcome surprise had it done so . But it is still good and enjoyable to watch . However , if you have not read the book and think that this DVD will be sufficient to understand the social commentary that Hugo was attempting to convey then you will be mistaken . Buy this DVD , enjoy it but also read the book to savour fully the awesome intensity of Hugo's monumental work .
030758836X|5.0|-If you want a boring, cookie-cutter ending to a book....if you need everything wrapped in a neat, little bow...this book isn't for you.  It is smart, fast paced, cringe-inducing, honest and deeply disturbed. The characters in turn break your heart and make you despise them and nothing is black and white. But you will think about it long after.  Amazing
B009FZHYKU|5.0|Can't believe I am hooked on a &#34;zombie&#34; show, but I am.  The drama of the survival aspect of the show is the real attraction.  I never watched a show that was so willing to kill off beloved characters so easily.  That keeps you tuned in too...rooting for your favorites to stay alive.
B00BHHIWQO|5.0|Addictive very goo d fun!! Been playing on laptop now on my kindle! Highly recommended! Trying too get more players!
B008AK8FHM|5.0|Hard to know where to begin. A loving, all true all knowing God, your conscientiousness not produced by the neurons but a soul or spirit living beyond time and space. No matter your religious or scientific bent this book will change your life!
0142419400|5.0|As a big fan of chick lit books, I'm really shocked at how long it took me to read this book.  Though this book can also fall in the YA genre, it most definitely falls into chick lit as well.  And stories such as this are the reason I so enjoy a good chick lit story.  It was sweet, emotional, and totally adorable!<br /><br />Anna gets sent to a boarding school in Paris.  Her father insists it will be a wonderful experience and oh-so-much fun, yet Anna is convinced otherwise.  She's happy in Atlanta with her BFF and love interest (who she just kissed - ohmygosh, is there a chance of a future for these lovebirds?!) and really has no interest in venturing off to a world unknown, where she doesn't even know how to speak their language.  She assumes from day one she will hate this trip, but she'll give it her best shot.<br /><br />I just adored Anna right from the beginning.  She gets thrown into this situation where she's the total underdog and completely overwhelmed... yet she adorably makes the best of it.  She's super friendly and meets friends easiy (including the loveable St. Clair!) and after much effort starts fitting right in with the locals.  Though the language is a struggle for her, she does her best.  She's a trooper, and I really liked that in her.  And can we just take a moment to talk about St. Clair?  Oh my GAWD... do people like him really exist?!  I forgot about my husband sitting next to me for a second.  Just a SECOND!  But still... wow.  Do they make St. Clairs that are my age?? ;)<br /><br />I completely fell in love with this author instantly.  Perkins' writing style is creative, fun and impeccable.  I felt as though I was right there in Paris with these characters, experiencing it all firsthand.  It definitely brought back some memories from my college years... though I didn't go to school in Paris.  (I wish!)  And man, did she get the teenage crush aspect exactly right!  The overwhelming emotions, the doubt, the questions... she had it all.  Amazing!<br /><br />This narrator was great as well.  I often complain about a female narrator trying to do a male voice.  Either it comes off too whiny or too feminine a majority of the time.  Kim Mai Guest did a fabulous St. Clair!  I loved him to pieces.  She also had the perfect rich, popular girl you love to hate voice.  You know, the whole \\"Like, seriously? You're ca-RAZY!\\" type of valley girl voice.  She nailed it!<br /><br />I may be the last person to read this story.  So if for some reason you're like me and have been living under a rock for the last year and a half and haven't yet read it, I suggest you do so. :)zing!<br /><br />This narrator was great as well.

0071636080|5.0|This book shows how Steve Jobs was insanely great because he prepared insanely. The chapters show that native talent, coupled with deep determination, can produce a great result.
B00BGIC2J2|2.0|This movie unfortunately is long winded, crass at times and not particularly funny.  It is only in the last few minutes that the couple actually creates a believable chemistry and gets the audience interested in their story- thats just too late...
0792838912|5.0|The chemistry between Kim Bassinger and Mickey Rourke is undeniable in this movie.  A very sensual and intense tale indeed.
B00B8WXFWE|1.0|I am not going to lie... I absolutely love the new kids... I am disappointed in this cd... it is all slow songs except for like 1... it has a feel of like they just threw it together right quick to make some fast money... I liked the block a lot!!! this does not even come close to being anywhere near as good... I have tried to listen to it a few times thinking that I just need to get to know it but this did not help... so if you are a fan of fun upbeat NKOTB songs this cd is not for you... I hope my review was helpful
B007FTZDN8|5.0|TED is a fascinating learning app for everyone but especially those interested in science.  The presentations are  given primarily in laymen terms so just about anyone can understand the concepts.  Check it out!
B001FVV2X2|5.0|Kinda like X-files meets Twilight Zone meets Dr Frankenstein....  I was riveted from the pilot and watched every episode. Enjoy!
030758836X|2.0|If you enjoyed a movie such as Arlington Road, you might like this. If you hated that movie (as I did), don't spend your time on this read, I assure you you will be disappointed.
B004XN3FHA|5.0|With the headlights of my 2007 Honda CRV on high beam shining on some bushes 200 ft away this light is every bit as bright as my headlights.
B00B2V66VS|5.0|A lot of fun, but tough for an old Guy; my reflexes are not what they once were.  I'll just practice, practice, PRACTICE!
B00BGICGJ8|1.0|This was a horrible movie. The out-takes were funny, but the movie was long and dry. I didn't think it would ever end. Don't buy! Borrow from a friend.
B0046B8GEQ|5.0|Recommended to us by our six year old granddaughter who wanted to see it yet again. And now we know why. Despicable Me was a wonderful family movie, often narrated by our granddaughter as she saw it for probably the fifth time and us for the first!
B000I9U972|5.0|This is one of the funniest movies ever! It's one of those movies that if you liked it then it has to be watched again every few years. The soundtrack is great too.
B008HK3XOU|3.0|The marware vibe standing case for kindle fire HD, It easily bend in the wrong place. Otherwise, it works well.
B00AHSGNJM|5.0|The actors in this movie are so colorful in their actions and words. Easy for a 3 year old to understand the actions and motives as the movie progresses. They love the turtles, espeically the sea gulls, and the aquarium inhabitants. Just a great overall movie. And NO ONE could do the job that Ellen does as Dora!
B00AQMQBKK|5.0|If you like the table top game elder sign, then definitely snag this app. Absolutely fantastic, it completely captures the mythos of the setting combined with background music and awesome artwork really give the feeling of being in a lovecraft tale. 2 expansion modules add additional investigators and old ones  at about $3 a pop is worth it. Hopefully a third expansion will be on the way to coincide with the expansion for the table top game! Love to seethe addition of blessed and cursed dice.  Remember your matching wits against one of the old ones, expect your investigators to get snuffed out or go insane more often then not! Look forward to seeing more fantasy flight games ported over.
B007IXWKUK|4.0|This book has more surprises and twists than the first. I could hardly put it down. Ana gets on my nerves when she continues her habit of over thinking things and over complicating things but honestly most women in books are given this characteristic. This books goes deeper into Christian's life, as well as builds on the love story. If you enjoyed the first one and like love stories than this book is for you.
B002TQKS14|5.0|Incredibly educational, entertaining and useful.<br />Author Michael Pollan begins by explaining in depth how Americans live in a &#34;corn dependent&#34; society and its implications both for the farmer, for the consumer and the taxpayer.  He emphasizes that most corn produced IS NOT for human eating.<br />He then presents various eating scenarios in depth, beginning with the one most of follow which is going to the supermarket and buying everything there.  He devotes much effort to explaining how corn fed beef, pork, and chicken have become mainstays and what this means in terms of the healfh of the animals and of the consumers.<br />He then analyzes in depth a second option which is the organic one.  The reader discovers that much of what is sold as &#34;organic&#34; is not quite what it looks like.  He does spend time on a single farm which is truly organic, but points out that this is an exception.<br />Finally he explores the possibility of &#34;hunting and gathering&#34; food and its consequiences.<br />He also cooks from each of these sources and serves it up to his family and vicariously to the reader.  Some of the dishes sound truly delicious.<br />To the reader: beware of going mushroom hunting on your own, unless you really know what you are doing.

B00AREIAI8|5.0|This app is awesome! I highly recommend this app! It is so fun! You get to take care of your very own horse.
B009LMTDL0|4.0|I read a lot of biographies and management books...and was really looking forward to this book. It was definitely engaging, held my interest and was a quick read. As an executive, though a bit older than Sheryl, I found this book somewhat unrealistic and whiny. People at the top are there because, beyond brains and education, they work 60-70+ hours a week. Man or woman, this is the way capitalism works--and it seems fair to me. I raised 2 daughters while working full time and made the choice to be home most nights for dinner v. rising all the way to the top. Several male and female co-workers chose to rise beyond me...I don't begrudge them, as they put in the work and deserved it. Most of these women did not have kids--it's a trade-off. (Though I do 'lean-in' quite naturally!)<br /><br />The part of the book I enjoyed most was her discussion of how poorly women treat other women in the work place. We need to go out of our way to treat our sisters better. The book does a good job in discussing how women tend to judge one another--all women want and deserve respect. I was stunned to find a story near the end that also happened to me--after returning from a 3-week maternity leave in which I was bored beyond belief (chosing to have kids late in life at an age where I could afford good help) my female boss invited me to her office upon my return to revile me by saying \\"she would have had more respect for me if I had taken my full 6 weeks.\\" Really? (She only lasted a year.)<br /><br />The older I get the more firmly I believe that in the workplace there is high value in just being nice and experience has taught me that nice people really DO get rewarded.<br /><br /> [[ASIN:0385349947 Lean In: Women, Work, and the Will to Lead]]
B000JMKTLO|5.0|A great book that takes you through the complicated life of the narrator and her childhood home. I just could not put it down.
B003O86FMW|5.0|I like how its divided and enjoyed the lecture. The end was so unexpected I'm still in shock! Cant wait to start the next one
B0027MJU00|5.0|The twists and turns in this story were like a rollercoaster- thrilling. Gillian Flynn is a great storyteller. Highly recommend. Can not wait until another of her books come out.
B001C1066E|1.0|Not what I expected it to be. There was so little room I could only fit like 10 pennies in it.
B006LSZECO|5.0|Another excellent book by Gillian Flynn. I can not wait another the next one is out! I have read all three and enjoyed each and every one!
B003TSEEDY|5.0|This boom was perfect. I see life differently now. Now, I feel infinite. And I'm not afraid anymore. Thank you.
B0099Y2MYK|5.0|This is a fully biased review because I greatly enjoy the show. Downton Season 3 will make you cry. While World War I has ended, drama is not far from Grantham & Crawley houses. If you loved seasons 1 & 2, 3 will not disappoint, though it will likely bring out more emotions.
B0010SKUYM|5.0|I've never been so enthralled and captivated in a book before. Rothfuss displayed a mastery of the English language and has me very eager for his next books.
0385349947|5.0|I purchased this as I am about to graduate from university and join the workforce & had heard the positive reviews in the Economist about it. I am a few chapters in & so far it doesn't disappoint. Hard cover, new, reasonably priced.
1401224792|4.0|The writing was excellent except too much of the story involved a flashback which regular readers of Fables will already know.  Perhaps it was necessary for people who are not familiar with Fables but I think they could have done it just as well in fewer pages.  The artwork was disappointing - at times it seemed more like sketchings.
B002ZTQVGQ|5.0|My son and I truly enjoy this movie so I was very happy to add this to our collection! I purchased this on the 16th and by the 19th it was on my doorstep! Truly wonderful service all around. 5 Stars!
B007MB5OCE|5.0|This book is a fun and interesting read.  I find myself coming back to it in my mind quite frequently.
B008K6HN8I|5.0|This is a great app, lets you get to any folder the easy way.  I recommend this fo everyone that has a tablet.
B005DOKK7Q|5.0|Love the bright color. Fits my purse. Keeps my Fire safe. Easy to clean. Easy to open and close. Good investment.
B00BTYP6QE|5.0|The entire family loves this series. I hope to see more in the future.  We love to see our son learning new problem solving and puzzle skills.
B00B2V66VS|3.0|I love this game there's more than just the plain water background of the first... but after I get so many power ups etc. the game wants to not load and I have to uninstall it then reinstall it again. When I do this I lose all my current stuff (except my high score) and it upsets me that I have to get everything all over again!!!
B005IQZB14|5.0|This was the type of book that you can't put down.  Cheryl Strayed put so much of her heart and soul into this book, and it shows.  I even bought a copy for my mom and sister, and they loved it.  Now, we all want to go hiking!
0060594888|5.0|I read it through once and am going to read it again and follow the program outlined.  I got this book from the library and was about 1/4 through when I decided to purchase it.  It will help me reach my dreams.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|This is the best app I have ever bought...honestly<br />It's just so much fun it's awesome I wish I knew how to unlock the girl
B004UHL9EK|5.0|Nice, neat, smooth and very customisable. I like! Would suggest a bigger start button. As big as the Dismiss button....
0307341577|4.0|This book had everything that's good about mystery novels...character building, suspense, twists and turns.  Some of the character building left me unsure if I actually liked any of the people in the book, though.  All of the characters had qualities that can only be described as disgusting.
B000FBFN1U|5.0|Amazing plot, and a great continuation of the story. The characters continue to develop, and new characters arise as favorites.
B00BEZTMFY|5.0|i gave this rating as it was a wonderful movie.  I think that it was better than the &#34;Lord of the Rings.  What I liked about it that it did not have so many hobbits running around in it.  I would recommand it to everyone.
0385528752|4.0|I ready it from my local library and chose to have my own copy I can personalize. I benefit from the supporting information and practical applications.
1451648537|4.0|While reading the book, it was surprising to note how many traits Jobs had in common with psychopaths.  In researching the question stated in my headline, I discovered that, in fact, many CEO's and other leaders can be classified as psychopaths albeit not to the same degree as those who commit murder and other violent acts.  In recent years, as the psychiatric community and other researchers have begun to publish studies claiming that many of our captains of industry, military commanders and other highly placed individuals show psychopathic tendencies, U.S. companies and other employers have begun to test applicants for these characteristics.  Of course, considering the fortune Jobs made for Apple, one has to wonder whether these companies, etc., are screening against psychopaths or are looking to hire them!
B005T87QCI|5.0|He enjoys the fighting. Graphics are good and controls work well, but you have to pay a dollar more to build your own robot.
B008220BP2|5.0|But seriously, though, this was a really good movie. It's nice to see a good love story come out of the Zombie boom of recent years. The last one was Shaun of the Dead, in my opinion.<br /><br />It's got all the best things:<br /><br />-Zombies<br />-Great Actors<br />-Humor<br />-A Love Story That Doesn't Feel Cobbled Together or Forced<br />-Awesome Tunes<br />-John Malkovich<br /><br />And if any of those brilliant sort of bullet points don't make you want to see this film, I don't think you have taste. Or a pulse. (HA HA HA I made a funny!.)<br /><br />Anyway, what I'm really getting at here is that this is a movie that doesn't let its setting or the fact that the male lead is a zombie inhibit it from being just a fun movie with a good story and a lot of heart.
B004XJRQUQ|5.0|This series continues to blow me away, even though I've read it several times already. These books are life changing!
B0025UHKNS|5.0|I have moved on to the 610 for a slightly smaller watch but will say that this never gave me any trouble through thousands of miles. my only tip would be to lock the bezel in wet conditions.(hold both buttons on right side) handed this down to a running partner and it is still running perfectly. Excellent purchase!!!
B008JFUO4U|5.0|\\"Oblivion\\" is great! This is how the story goes: 2077: Jack Harper (Tom Cruise) serves as a security repairmen stationed on an evacuated Earth. Part of a massive operation to extract vital resources after decades of war with a terrifying alien threat who still scavenges what's left of our planet, Jack's mission is almost complete. In a matter of two weeks, he will join the remaining survivors on a lunar colony far from the war-torn world he has long called home.<br /><br />Living in and patrolling the breathtaking skies from thousands of feet above, Jack's soaring existence is brought crashing down after he rescues a beautiful stranger from a downed spacecraft. Drawn to Jack through a connection that transcends logic, her arrival triggers a chain of events that forces him to question everything he thought he knew. With a reality that is shattered as he discovers shocking truths that connect him to Earth of the past, Jack will be pushed to a heroism he didn't know he contained within. The fate of humanity now rests solely in the hands of a man who believed our world was soon to be lost forever.<br /><br />The cast led by Tom Cruise (as Jack Harper) & Morgan Freeman (as Beech) is great. The directing by Joseph Kosinski (who also produced & wrote the screenplay and the comic book of which the movie is based on) is great. The screenplay by Kosinski, Karl Gajdusek & Michael Arndt (which is based on the comic book by Kosinski & Arvid Nelson) is great.<br /><br />The music by M83, Joseph Trapanese & Anthony Gonzalez is great. The cinematography by Claudio Miranda is great. The film editing by Richard Francis-Bruce is great. The casting by Marcia Ross is great. The production design by Darren Gilford is great. The art direction by Joseph Bahran, Todd Cherniawsky, James Clyne & Kevin Ishioka is great. The set decoration by Ronald R. Reiss, set designs by Steve Cooper, Joseph Hiura, Robert Andrew Johnson, Jeff Markwith, Maya Shimoguchi & Randall D. Wilkins, set dressings by Frank Hendrick, Kevin C. Lang, Daniel Newton & Meagan Skerchock is great. The costume design by Marlene Stewart is great. The special effects coordinated by Eggert Ketilsson, supervised by Michael Meinardus is great. The visual effects coordinated by Danielle Bemis, Patrick Halm, Chelsea Kammeyer, Zhunan Li, Sebastian Meszmann, Elizabeth Montes, Hayley Perkins, Sharina Radia, Cara Samuels, Deborah R. Scott, Julia Smola, Adrian Steel, Shanshan Xie & Siyun Yi, supervised by Eric Barba & Bjorn Mayer is great. The stunts coordinated by Robert Alonzo & Joey Box is great.<br /><br />This is a well-done, well-crafted sci-fi / action / adventure film that is entertaining and well-made. This is a film that also has an interesting and intriguingly-done concept that is / or has been solidly interpreted on film. Tom Cruise gives a solidly great performance as Jack Harper. Joseph Kosinski has crafted a film that is completely different and original from his previous film, \\"Tron: Legacy\\", the sequel to \\"Tron\\". This is one of the best sci-fi films of the year and probably, one of the best films of the spring season, as well.

B006LSZECO|1.0|Boring, I fell asleep so many times while trying to read this book I didn't know if I would ever get through it. To me it was a terrible waste of money. The book did not flow well and just about the time you thought it may get interesting, it didn't.
B00770KR7W|2.0|My son wanted this for his birthday.  It was broken within 20 minutes of being open.  The foot cracked and can't be fixed.  He is 9 so it wasn't like he was pounding it on the table.  Pretty disappointing.
B00B3HJMLM|5.0|This album is dedicated to young people who want to enjoy their spring break parties...fun in the sun and cold beer.  Party on.
006224454X|1.0|This is one of the most boring books I have ever read and as another reviewer said could have been written in 20 pages. I am amazed at the positive reviews.<br /><br />I ploughed on to the predictable end and resented all my wasted time. This is the sort of book I would like a refund for wasting money and time on.
B009MO5ES8|4.0|\\"Premium Rush\\" was apparently a late-summer release -- not usually a help at the box office.  I don't know how it did in that regard but I found it to be very exciting and visually involving with some good  touches of humor along the way.  The lead character \\"Wiley\\" is played  by Joseph Gordon-Levitt, whom I consider to be a very gifted actor judging from some of his earlier films, notably \\"Mysterious Skin\\" (2004) and \\"The Lookout\\" (2007).  He is also fine in this film with great screen presence and physical ability; he did many of the risky bicycle stunts himself.  He plays the part of a delivery guy on a bike in busy Manhattan who is attempting to deliver a package that his adversary, well played by Michael Shannon, wants to grab before he can deliver it.<br /><br />Basically this is a rather simple set up story wise, but the  cinematography throughout Manhattan has to be seen to be believed.  The camera car is the real hero of the film and is shown in the special features section as being a highly maneuverable vehicle having a camera arm in its roof extending several feet beyond the front or back of the car.  I imagine the cinematographer would be sitting in the back seat with camera controls and a video-assist set up providing control of a Panaflex hanging from the end of the arm resulting in the some very nifty shooting.  Watching on a flat-screen of a decent size, the viewer's sense of motion and involvement is undeniable.  Gordon-Levitt's \\"Wiley\\" character hooks us right from the start and we are on the bike with him thanks to the subjective POV shooting made possible with the camera car.<br /><br />Joseph Gordon-Levitt has had a few small but important roles in some recent big-ticket pictures; I'm predicting that his blockbuster is not too far away.  :.
B0063M22QO|4.0|I enjoy playing the game, but it does not save the new games that were added such as basket, kite flying, and vial.
B009FB3XTA|5.0|If you are a Twilight Fan, then you will want all of the CD's from the Films. Even if you aren't a Twilight fan, the music is great.
B0094M4R3Q|4.0|Great movie for the light side.  Not much more I can add to this.  I will watch again.  Enjoyable and relaxing.
B008BRC6NS|4.0|I liked the CD very much, but I would like to have had more of Jennifer' newer song on the CD. The CD is worth buying. I would recommend to all who like Jennifer Lopez to buy this CD.

B00BSBT8M6|5.0|This movie was fantastic for our whole family! Even though the younger members didn't understand everything in the plot,the amazing graphics and animal scenes kept them happy! Those of us that did understand everything were impressed and moved emotionally..... Great acting and scripting! LOVED it!!!
B00632HWOG|5.0|Because I use Yahoo mail it is so much easier to get it on my Kindle than the usual method
B0071XO8RA|5.0|If you like your fiction speculative, your characters colorful, and your plots twisted, you will love Wool. It has been quite a while since I was so thoroughly engaged in a narrative like this, but Howey is that special blend of story-teller and world-builder that leaves you with a smile on your face and a hunger for more.
B006P4FBUE|5.0|Great for going over  a few notes when practicing my music and I don't need to get out my keyboard.

B0019N95IK|5.0|Breathtaking visuals and terrific extras, plus getting to know the intrepid, but flawed and sometimes renegade Archer along with earth's first explorers in deep space is pure pleasure. These stories represent the best of what science fiction and especially Star Trek can offer. Highly recommended
B00005LK94|5.0|Movie that older children should watch. Family values, tough time survival, and believing in ourselves....Being respectful of nature. Movie moves at a slower pace, but teaches a LOT.
B00006RCOB|5.0|From the get-go let me state that I was a huge fan of the novel that this film was based on, and was very stunned that the translation of that book into celluloid was equally as good. A freakish accomplishment given the notorious track record of such translations.<br /><br />Also, let me preface that I'm a huge fan of Clint Eastwood. Long before he became the elder statesman of the film industry and winning several Academy Awards, these early directorial efforts proved that he was always much more than a rugged action star. In fact, I willingly suffered through films that I suspected I would dislike, simply to enjoy his performances.<br /><br />Indications of his future brilliance were all on display in this 80's action/thriller.<br /><br />Tells the story of Mitchell Gant, retired officer of the US Air Force. Having left the service due to what was then called Delayed Stress Syndrome, what we now call PTSD, Gant suffers intermittent and debilitating flashbacks when confronted with intense emotional situations; the illness grounding him into an early retirement. But a seminal breakthrough across the planet requires his very specific set of skills be employed once more.<br /><br />Despite having access to thousands of current and former military pilots from across the free world, Gant is the lone aviator who fits a very specific profile needed for an emergency mission. In addition to being fluent in Russian and a former member of the Constant Peg Aggressor Squadron - US pilots trained in obtained Soviet aircraft and their combat styles - he's also a dead-ringer for a known heroine dealer.<br /><br />As Gant is \\"volunteered\\" for the mission, it becomes clear that almost every intelligence and military officer involved in the secret project does not believe he'll succeed. With so many disparate parts and parties that have to synch perfectly, it's an unspoken but foregone conclusion that the effort is doomed. And any failure along the mission path equals tortuous death at the hands of the KGB -or- a lonely frozen death by drowning in the Arctic Sea.<br /><br />For all intents, he knows this is a one-way suicide mission.<br /><br />A very entertaining action/thriller with Eastwood guiding what could have easily wrecked with over-dramatization and collapsing into cold war hyperbole. His deft handing of the script emphasizing the thievery and thief - and less the geopolitical ramifications of a revolutionary combat airframe that threatens world peace.<br /><br />Movie Notes:<br /><br />- Firefox's author, Craig Thomas, wrote the novel based on his own air combat experience and strange rumors he had heard through the professional grapevine about a theoretical aircraft design that was said to be \\"invisible\\" to radar.<br /><br />Though vehemently denied for a quarter of a century, in 1988, and nearly 12 years after Thomas' book was published in 1977, the United States announced that it had produced so-called stealth aircraft that were undetectable to radar detection systems of that period.<br /><br />- The name Firefox is not the name associated with or given by the Soviet air force to their planes. Just as today with Russian aircraft, in the west we assign nicknames beginning with certain letters to help our forces quickly and easily identify opposition hardware. For example, the letters 'B' for bombers or 'C' for commercial. In the novel, an imagined MiG-31 advanced combat aircraft is given the NATO nickname of Firefox - 'F' for fighter.<br /><br />Personal Note:<br /><br />- I'm a fan of character actor Freddie Jones, and absolutely love his typical presentation of character: The professional who speaks with emphatic pronunciation overlaid with a personality of smooth knowing guile. Thought his performance was superlative as the MI6 officer who authors the fantastical plan to steal Russia's most advanced aircraft.at the hands of the KGB -or- a lonely frozen death by drowning in the Arctic Sea.<br /><br />For all intents, he knows this is a one-way suicide mission.<br /><br />A very entertaining action/thriller with Eastwood guiding what could have easily wrecked with over-dramatization and collapsing into cold war hyperbole.

B00C7TAF3Y|5.0|Such a cool game I couldn't stop! I finished in a few hours but those hours where fun! They should make another room.<br /><br />Overall:<br />Totally worth 2 bucks!!! :)
B00C1BUYX4|3.0|Zzzzzzzzzz! Wake me up when it's over. Oh, I'm supposed to like it because its about the 13th amendment and its passage? I like movies that I find entertaining, not tedious historical reenactments Iike this one.
078401213X|1.0|Bad movies like this stereotypes math/science lovers as strange geeks.  What a piece of doo doo as a movie.  I wouldn't watch it again even if someone paid me to.
B00BGZ8OLA|5.0|Amazing movie. Beautiful to look at, entertaining and with a great message. It would be easy to rewatch several times.
B005NFVZTM|4.0|It did a great job at character building and setting the stage for the other X-Men movies.  Plus, it had enough action and suspense to keep you involved and wanting more.
B00BEZTMWW|5.0|Excellent movie, good fun and fantastic pictures. We are looking forward to part two of this fantastic journey which closes nicely the gap to Lord of the Ring.
B00CEIGYAG|5.0|Daft Punk are back and this new album is shaping up to be their best work... The bass line is infectious.
B00B2V66VS|4.0|only thing I hate is the tunnel thing with the cart cause I always die when I have to duck.
B007ZGO7EM|5.0|One of the main reasons I love this particular app is the keypad size and functions. You need to try it.
B00A9T1HUO|2.0|This vocalist is a favorite but this one missed the boat for intensity and variety.I had higher expectations. It certainly made me long for the return of retail stores so I could scan more and ask a few questions of someone who knows his/her music.
B00AUBNFEW|5.0|Ornette was a pioneer in new free jazz improvisation, and this LP was one of his best and still sounds fresh and innovative. Amazing playing from all members of the band. And this 45 rpm recording shows of the music with the best sonics ever available. Highly recommended.
B00AG6Z92C|2.0|I really felt it was more and more of the same and devoid of a variety of feeling and depth of sentiment which I think should befit this theme. I really like this performer and was disappointed.
B00B2DSIAI|4.0|My grandson doesn't really understand the old computer games connections, but loves the movie. It's one of his favorites. I will buy it for my other grand kids.
B0083ZBW2Y|5.0|Even though this is an old book, it's really interesting. It's about this dog who is a St. Bernard Shepherd mix who gets stolen from sunny California. Then is taken to the snowy Klondike to be a sled dog that goes through many trials.
030758836X|2.0|I'm really not sure how this particular book is getting such rave reviews.  Perhaps it is because I listened to the audiobook rather than reading it myself, but this book just went on forever before getting remotely interesting.  The first half is very obviously written to get us to think the husband did it, so obviously done that of course he didn't do it... Once you get past that part, the plotline is a bit unusual and very chilling, but even that part drags on for quite a long time.  This was my introduction to Gillian Flynn, and I won't be reading another of her novels as a result.
B00C5W3SBE|5.0|I when to  see the the movie in 3d it was great i have a 3d tv I'am not going to pay far 30 bucks far just a blueray I want a 3d copy are all 3d br d dvd. Thank you
B005K17RU0|5.0|As a frequent traveler, I find this app very necessary.  Have always depended on Accuweather and now that I have it for mobile device, it is even more useful.
B008XG1X18|3.0|It needs not to be forcing close so often. It runs too slow on occasion too. Otherwise it is a good app.
B008XG1X18|5.0|who hoo.  No longer have to wait till I get to computer to check out pinterets latest. Love the craft boards.
0142407542|5.0|I love these books. As far as I know there are too, I have a 3 year old an she has loved the Gruffalo since she was just 2.
B00A81MV3U|1.0|If your idea of a date movie is a family screaming at each other from beginning to end, plus actors shouting, rather than speaking....then this is for you.<br />Jennifer Lawrence pouts and says the F word a lot, which is obviously how to win as Oscar in 2013. Bradley Cooper seems to think that to be taken seriously in a movie, that he has to over act in just about every scene.<br />If I suffered with mental illness I would be insulted by this portrayal and in my opinion it fails on every level.<br />What happened to nuanced acting, letting expression say the lines for you, rather than shouting everything at the top your voice ?<br />I had been looking forward to this for so long and ended up really disappointed.
B004ZMWUCU|5.0|Loved the main characters in this story and couldn't wait to see how their lives would unfold.  Couldn't put it down.  Moments of humor woven into such tragic parts of their lives.  Ending was not what I predicted, a book is even better to me when I can't figure it out halfway through.  Story has some heartbreaking parts, but my heart is full after having read this story.
B005HXGE9G|5.0|I liked his genesis stuff going back to foxtrot to the lamp album. his solo stuff is good as well.
B008OOYALE|4.0|Good game<br />Like the different types of dragons you can breed to create hybrids and rare dragons......just wish you made more money..and didn't cost as much to remove debris....
B004NJW976|5.0|I got this one because i am a Moby fan and liked his stuff since 1999 album play. It is a good album to get if you like his stuff.
B00ATDOVNK|4.0|This is one of the best games I have played in this genre. The story is a bit light on plot, but the great graphics and surprise effects kept me completely entertained. Not a bad way to waste a few hours. Using the map is a great way to progress in the game without using hints. Loved the elevator. All in all very imaginative.
B00005RFAI|5.0|This album is a good one to have if you like pink and her music. I enjoy it and like her new stuff too.
1401938906|4.0|This little book gives readers a chance to try out the principles of the Law of Attraction. The author reviews each of nine principles and then provides an experiment to test the theory.  Each experiment lasts no longer than 48 hours and requires no special equipment or great effort to complete.  More of a playbook than a workbook, it gives the reader the opportunity to have some fun and lighten up.<br /><br />The author's approach is light and her writing is, at times, almost jokey. But overall this is a fun approach to cover fairly standard LOA ground. Recommended.
B005LZW9CG|5.0|I enjoyed the 1990's remasters of his stuff. but his gold one that came out are great to get if you like new sounding albums of his.
B00BQ1DAHC|5.0|I preordered this because my son and I really enjoyed their last CD. This new one has really grown on me and I cant stop playing it. I really like their guitar work, drums, and the lead singer's voice. Thanks, Volbeat...you guys rock!
B00BR4QNJ0|5.0|sequel to my favorite game and even better than the first one. this game will blow your mind. if you don't have this app you are missing out.
B00APAENUI|4.0|I have been reading through the Honor Harrington books from start for the past week or so.  I am a huge military sci-fi fan and I cannot believe that I haven't discovered these books before.  The space battles in these books are incredible.  However, the seeming invincibility of Honor Harrington is beginning to get a little annoying.  To be honest, every break seems to fall her way.  I am not sure if anyone can defeat her, in space combat or otherwise.<br /><br />There is really no drama if you are certain that Honor cannot lose.  I will continue reading, but ultimately this will probably make these books less enjoyable.  At this point, even if she did lose to someone or something, I am not sure I would find that credible.  I hope that Weber's tale lures me back in again as the books progress.
B00BR4QNJ0|5.0|this is the best you cant be a zombie that I know of which is a let down but has 2 new awesome characters with their own ability's
B008OOYALE|5.0|I love this game because you  get to take care of dragons .I think other people will love playing this game very much too.
B009X010RU|4.0|The design is solid. The color is nice. It provides a good buffer for the tablet. The stand on the back is a little flimsy but it works. The elastic is great and it's good not to have a magnet.
1476734941|3.0|This text is interesting in diet outlined that it presented, but it lacks sufficient science to back up the claims.  It is more anecdotal in nature than hard science.
B005S9EKCW|5.0|I've seen the movie at the theatre and feel it's the best movie i've ever seen. Totally spectacular and very moving.
B0045HCJRG|5.0|To the few of us old enough to remember being taught manners. The bar room scene and dance are worth the price.
B009LL4LMM|5.0|Great little game with super cute graphics and a nice storyline. Quite easy to complete and can be finished in a couple of hours as it gets quite addictive...<br />Great free app of the day!
B003DNN0L2|5.0|Mr. Fox comes highly recommended.  Non stop laughter and smiles.  Ash and Kristopherson really get the job done!  What the cus!
B003Q6CUAI|5.0|Cannot fault this. It explains everything, makes perfect sense and it does work. Lots of ideas and explanations on how the human digestion system works.  I just want a magic quick fix.
0688014291|5.0|I have always enjoyed this book. I keep loaning them ou and they never come back. It's a quick read but has so much inside.
B007TK77QE|5.0|I was dubious about this book despite being a Harry Potter fan. I wondered if she could keep me glued to the story as she had done in the past. The short answer is yes, I loved it and did not want to put it down. I have recommended it to so many people as people have the misconception the J K can only do childrens stories. Not so
B004XJRQUQ|5.0|5 stars because it makes you read and read and read and never want to stop!<br /><br />I loved it because it has an amazing, thrilling story. Not just romance, but there's a political struggle behind the whole story.<br />Besides, you keep reading to see who will Katniss choose: Peeta or Gale? She does make a choice :)
B005K17RU0|5.0|I am always using this app to check how the weather is going to be, It is just the best weather app for checking current and week long weather conditions.
B0093LFXIG|5.0|It's fantastic because even if you are a McFly fan for years, there are things you can't possibly imagine. I really didn't have high expectations, thought it would have just a couple of uninteresting facts...I couldn't be more wrong.<br /><br />After you read it, you get a feeling that the guys are really just like anyone else. They've had happy, funny, glamorous, dangerous and really really serious and sad moments in their lifetime as a band. It's amazing that they decided to share so much with everybody. That's what makes them so....unique...so....McFly!<br /><br />It makes you laugh, smile, cry and mainly, understand so much about McFly and the decisions they made throughout their carreer.<br />It is also great that the whole book is narrated by them. You can visualize each one saying what they are saying.<br /><br />I recommend it to any McFly fan :)
B00005JKNF|1.0|If you like Dowton Abbey, which I do (a lot!), you may not like this.  It was hard to hear and see, and the story was slow and plodding.  The video quality was murky and the sound was often unintelligible.  We had to use subtitles to follow the plot, such as it was.  The characters were not engaging or interesting and the acting talent, especially the fabulous Maggie Smith, was wasted.  I don't know why this movie received so much critical and popular acclaim.  I could have done a lot of better things with the time I spend watching it, including rearranging my sock drawer.
B00AZKCU7G|5.0|One of the two films i went to see in a theater. DVDs are my way of seeing films for the cost of the popcorn

B009AMANH4|5.0|The best portrayal of some of the closing days of the civil war and Lincoln's struggles I've seen. Truly deserved the recognition it received.
B005PK1G76|5.0|This fits perfectly on our Graco Mickey Mouse stroller! I don't know what I was thinking getting a stroller with no child tray or parent tray. We used this yesterday for the first time, at our trip to the zoo. It held two drinks(Playtex 9oz sippy cup, and Gatorade bottle) with no problem. In the middle I put a snack cup and two sandwiches in with the bottles and it held perfectly! It is smaller than what it looks like from the picture, but it is more than I could of asked for especially for the price. I can't wait to use it on our trip to Disney in a couple months. It is definitely worth the money, and I would highly recommend it! I am actually thinking of getting one to use a child tray since it was smaller in size than I expected.
