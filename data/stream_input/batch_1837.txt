B009FZFONO|5.0|Great scare fest with good action and drama.<br />Only downside is they need professional technical experts for better realism.<br />two thumbs up.
B00008BXJG|3.0|I like the first couple of songs but most of the album, not so much.  I will give it a couple of more shots.
B005LAJ23A|5.0|Great scare fest with good action and drama.<br />Only downside is they need professional technical experts for better realism.<br />two thumbs up.
B00355L2TU|5.0|I bought this through Amazon's instant videos to supplement the core fitness class I attend. I did not find level 1 challenging enough so I moved on to level 2.  It has been about 2 weeks and I like level 2 so far, but sometimes I pause the video to increase the workout's intensity (extend the cardio, do more reps in the strength and ab training, etc.). I have not done level 3 yet but I look forward to it!
B007704HO6|4.0|Enjoyed the book. Great to have a look into Bob's & James's life.  Hard to put book down wanting to know what was happening next.
B0076DELIG|4.0|Harry Bosch in great form.  The twists and turns made it very suspenseful - I would recommend it highly.  I hope Connelly wiritees mor Bosch books
B0053O89WY|5.0|my whole family loves this show, its hilarious, and yet not stupid like a lot of shows of today, you learn something new every episode as well!
B007HACDLK|4.0|This is a very good story, with lots of dramatic interplay between the good guys and the bad guys. Mitch Rapp comes on a little strong in the early chapters with his caustic disregard for the chain of command. This, however, is corrected by an explosion induced bout of amnesia. Thankfully, once back in his familiar form, Rapp proves to be the ruthless eliminator of anyone who gets in his way, that we all remember. The story moves well with lots of good action scenes, and some surprising turns in the plot toward the end.
6304711905|5.0|this movie is excellent, if it doesn't make you want to be a cowboy nothing will, excellent story line as well as gun play.
B001AH6ZWY|5.0|Great movie! Another outstanding performance by Jodie Foster. The characters in this movie were well developed with intense depth.  Very enjoyable and not your typical Hollywood movie.
B004SBS8LA|5.0|angry birds took the world by storm and this is a great add on game that took the attention away from the evil piggies!
B002VPE1WK|5.0|It is great bag and it has lot of room for all accessories of SLR D3200. Aesthetic is ver good. Thank you amazon
B000ICZD4I|5.0|this movie is crazy, they kill and man and cook him and feed him to the whole town, its hilarious and creepy all at the same time, a  must see!
B006LSZECO|4.0|Well written, interesting plot, definitely a page turner.  One surprise after another from page 1 to the very last one.
B00AHSIQWE|5.0|this movie is absolutely amazing, one of the best batman movies ever made, christopher nolan is a genius and i will watch any movie with his name associated!
B00A9C3RB8|1.0|This movie i thought would be funny with some sexual humor but all it was, was stupid low class kick you in the balls kind of funny. I didn't even finish the movie because the story line and filler was so bad, i love the actors but the movie left much to be desired.
B00000JLWW|5.0|this is seriously one of the best movies of all time, the story line is excellent, James Cameron is awesome!
B000XUBFE2|5.0|Outstanding novel, a must read.  I don't want to give away anything, but one of the most well-crafted books I've read in years.  Creative, gritty, real, beautiful and excruciating.  I plan to teach it in the future as an English teacher, it is worth re-reading and thinking about.
B0006N2EZ0|5.0|this is a great movie, kevin costner is awesome, whitney, god rest her soul, is amazing! queen of the night for sure!
B0085P2Z6E|5.0|This game helps pass the time like no other.  I work nights and it helps significantly.  It helps to keep me awake and alert.
B001KDQ4KQ|5.0|This story deals with a very difficult yet real issue: suicide. Written with gentleness, compassion & honesty, the reader learns all sides of the story. Nothing is ever black and white, nor is there a simple solution to a problem. This story expands the mind & heart of the reader.
B0017R5UAA|4.0|I first heard of Fleet Foxes from the free MP3 download of &#34;Mykonos&#34; from the Amazon MP3 store, and loved it.  Then I started checking out the other songs on Youtube, and had to own this album.  These are the perfect &#34;road-trip&#34; songs; majestic and free flowing, with an independent spirit tagging along for the ride.<br /><br />Standout songs (for me) include: Ragged Wood, Quiet Houses, Heard Them Stirring, Your Protector, Meadowlarks
B00003CXSP|5.0|good movie good ship great shape quick how many words can i say great good quick in oh three more
1442474440|5.0|The classic pirate tale.  This hardcover edition is glorious, with the immaculate paintings of N.C. Wyeth scattered throughout.  The perfect novel to add to anyone's collection.
B007J4T2G8|4.0|Unique story enjoyed reading it not for the beam but the story behind  it and my applause for Ana leaving.
B000FCK65W|4.0|This book is amazing.  The characters are well developed and the story is a history lesson for those who didnt experience the great depression.  My, how times have changed.
B007J4T2G8|5.0|Very erotic!!!! The charactere were interesting and I was looking forward to what was going to happen next. Loved it.
B005LAIHR2|5.0|I was really surprised  by this movie. It had received some really bad reviews when it was in the theatres. Yet if you grew up in the 80s when suset strip was setting the stage for some of our classic bands then you will love this. My favorite of the movie was when Cruise did wanted dead or alive he was awsome. Great music from that time
B003JIPJRE|5.0|If you are a Batman fan, you will love this one. It is yet another heartbreaker in Bruce Wayne's life.
B00006674X|5.0|This by far is one of Elvis's best movies. I had read once that he really did not like doing movies, that he didnt fancy himself an actor. Yet it really feels and looks like he really ejoyed doing this one.
B004DSX5B6|5.0|I have purchased several multi-tools for the men in my life over the years, and this is consistently the one they rave about and ask me where to get more so they can give them to their friends (and hoard to have one in every place they may need it!).  It is very well constructed and is one-stop shopping for many everyday uses.
B0091LS07E|4.0|Alicia Keys rocks!  She has a great voice that is not mainstream, and man can she play the piano!  Having said that, if I would have looked closer and seen that Nicki Minaj was on this album, I would have never bought it.  She ruins the experience of Girl On Fire for me.  NM is classless and talentless (my opinion) and Alicia Keys would have been better off without bringing her on to collaborate.
B008AWBQGM|4.0|This album is well written and performed to a superior level of musicianship. The sound is more countryish than hard southern rock, but quite enjoyable to listen to.
B000OONQ9O|5.0|like bad boys my husband has wanted this movie for quite some time and thanks to Amazon he is now enjoying both. Thx!
B000003CMC|4.0|I am a big fan of the Allman Brothers, but the quality of this recording was not superior as I had expected it would be. I thought that this album had been remastered, but it appears that this particular release is an early recording. In retrospect it appears that the deluxe edition being offered would be a much better buy than this one.
B0085P2Z6E|3.0|Not bad. But the story drones on forever.  Good seek and find. Very pretty. I don't have anything else to say
B004ZZS4CC|5.0|She helped me to understand just how one can be brainwashed into believing an abuser...and accepting that because i was 18 when i told, \\"i should not have known better\\"...which is what i always felt. Jaycee is so brave to let the world feel her pain, her fear and her struggles. I thank her for doing this...she helped me..and probably many others as well
B0070Y46UY|5.0|i dont read a lot of books but liked this a lot<br />that is all i have to say about that
B009SJ3GUK|5.0|Missed an episode.  Amazon and American Horror story...great combo!  Highly recommend both seasons.  One episode and you will be addicted.
0446343129|5.0|Very good history of sugar use, with amazing information on health effects of eating sugar.  I don't eat sweets anyway, but get tempted this time of year with all the treats out.  Get your sweets from fruit, skip the white sugar!<br />Update.  I have read the book twice more.  It has a lot of valuable information in it besides sugar.  Like why Chinese smokers don't get lung cancer in the high rates like we have in the States.  Also on treating low blood sugar and diabetics.  Study, absorb, it is Life saving information.
B009NPA3Q4|4.0|If you loved Phillip Phillips on American Idol, you will love this CD. He has stayed true to his sound.
9562916464|5.0|If you are challenged by grammar, then this is a great book and it not, it's still a great book. Classic.
B002NVTSGQ|5.0|One of my favorite episodes ever of Modern Family. I had been searching for this episode everywhere and finally found it! Amazing episode.
B004DLPXAO|5.0|I love Kindle but I don't' have the time to read I'd like and it's for my phone so I'm having to use reading glasses now and I hate them. Otherwise it's a great app.
B005IQZB14|5.0|I loved this book, though there were some things I found offensive.  Casual sex and use of the &#34;f&#34; bomb are never pretty in women, though I guess it's supposed to show we can get down and dirty like men do.  (Is that a good thing?)  But in this book, it was a real part of the journey as Cheryl strayed (yes, this is a pun) from her &#34;boring&#34; life.  I have hiked a little of the Pacific Crest Trail in Washington, so I could imagine parts of her trek.  Wow.  That she stuck with it when others (didn't matter if it was men or women) dropped by the way was impressive.  Frankly, I hoped at the end she would reunite with her husband.  He sounded like a nice guy.  She didn't but it sounds like she emerged with a new view of herself and maybe even a kinder, gentler woman.  There were parts I think many outdoors women could relate to.  I have no problem recommending it with the caviat mentioned at the beginning of this review.
B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|It's the a wonderful harbinger of a new season, season 3, starting January 6, 2013.  Absolutely....am itching to watch it!
B0084U0IEG|4.0|While the topic of this book is ostensibly British secret agents during the Mad Men era, it's actually rather a gentle book, focused much more on youthful reminiscences and young love. It's suspenseful enough to keep things moving along, with a wry, smart narrator who's still not quite smart enough to read the men in her life properly, and some interesting twists that, without giving any spoilers away, provide some thoughts on how the act of a writer in examining events can also change those events and make them less authentic. In some aspects this idea of being an observer can come across as distancing, but overall the book is an intriguing and fast read that should be compelling for people who are fans of things like the show The Hour.
B009YP9L7U|3.0|Don't read this if you are looking for in-depth characters or elaborate back-stories.  This is just a fun, fast read.  There are gaping holes in the story like pages were forgotten--leaves the reader wondering &#34;what just happened; how did she get there so fast&#34;?  At times, one must read between the lines.  Cute story, and entertaining for an afternoon.
B001EOQWEO|5.0|Guess I'm still a kid at heart. Fun movie with a little love interest. Wall-E is Fun-E! my kids,nephews & nieces are going to enjoy it for a long time i'm betting.
B009NPKTN6|5.0|The cast of this movie is incredible.  Tom Cruise,  Alec Baldwin, Russell Brandt, Catherine Zeta Jones, Julianne Hough, Mary J.Blige and many more well known stars.  I really enjoyed hearing the music i grew up on ( the 80's ).  Everything you think was happening in the LA bar scene in the 80's is on this film.  Lots of great entertainment.
B008F5YDRI|4.0|This film was funny and romantic. Nicely done, although not super believable. Ewan McGregor was fantastic as always. It was entertaining and visually very beautiful.
B005LAIHZE|5.0|This movie exceeded my expectations. I had read the book and was really pleased with the movie. I would recommend this movie to any action movie buff.
B0095T3H2U|4.0|This film was really cute and funny and dramatic. However, it was like three films in one.  They could have made a trilogy, really. Make sure you have the time to watch this before you commit.
B00846TRHY|4.0|I found the movie to be riveting and challenging in our response to the brutality against the people of Sudan. Coarse language was hard to tolerate at times.
1400049628|5.0|There really isn't anything I can say that hasn't already been said. This book is great. It covers lots of topics, like how to choose a new home, weapons... and explains the strengths and weaknesses of each option. The way everything is presented, like this really could happen, kept the book from seeming like some kind of fairy tale. I love it.
B002V091IO|5.0|This was a sweet love story that took me back to memories of fun youth. It was well written and I could not put it down. Lovely!
0307888681|5.0|I love how the story is told from the perspective of lots of people. Not just one, or event the viewpoint of the person that gathered all of the stories. By staying in a short-story format, it is easy to read in small sections, and stays believable. I still reread this book every few weeks.
B004LOMB2Q|5.0|I have three different systems, tablet, windows phone and Windows desktop. Evermore is the only way I can sync between all three. It works and works well.
B008IYR2BA|5.0|This is Fabulous!  I just loved the whole season.  Wonderful depth and plot twists.  The writers did a top notch job.
B003O86FMW|5.0|Great story!  I will definitely read again before the movies come out.  I would recommend to anyone looking for an easy exciting read.
B004QX07G4|3.0|I love Ellen!  Her talk show is great, but this book was just okay.  I think her humor is better in the spoken word, rather than the written word.
B002BU4HWE|1.0|Not only is this movie completely inaccurate historically (both Jim Averil and Ella were hanged by &#34;regulators&#34; for starters, but that's only the beginning of the colossal betrayal of history in this film), it is so contrived and boring as to be too painful to watch.  The endless scenes of screaming immigrants were beyond tiresome.  The violence against women and children during the &#34;war&#34; scenes was obscene and completely made up...few were killed in this &#34;war&#34; (the movie has a cast of thousands dying), and the only women's death I know of was a hanging.  I'm so tired of Hollywood's messaging...why can't we have honest Westerns, or stories of any genre without all the arrogant self-indulgence of crusading idiots.
B005D63ICI|5.0|This season was terrific.  I really don't have much more to add than that to this review, but I have to have over 16 words.
B009NPK1IO|5.0|Although this isn't my favorite season ever, it is essential when we are so near the end. The last episode is my favorite.
B004LOMB2Q|4.0|It is an awesome note taker but hate the daily updating.  It does not seem to update anything.  Overall I still like it.
B009HEJXFS|4.0|Josh Brolin was wonderful as a young K, so funny to see him acting like Tommy Lee Jones.  Great story line, fun to watch, loved how they tied it all up in the end.
B0098VYKSA|4.0|Go ahead and Just watch it. It is a good spin on the Snow White story. It does not disappoint.
B008ODZUN2|2.0|Although with any affair, you don't expect rosy outcomes, but there is also more romance. The chemisty I felt was terribly lacking.<br />I watched it to see Rachel Weisz's performance which although great didn't detract from how disjointed the story was told.<br />I suppose the continuous &#34;flashbacks&#34; and learning why this is the end seem to leave me cold. I don't have any feeling or understanding for any of the characters.
B008NABUU8|2.0|after the update,game music plays but the screen is now blank. I had to push random areas to close game...please fix. (HTC Sensation)
B009WO7NQO|5.0|I Really love this game!! Has Great graphics!! Great Star Wars themes!! Way to go Angry Birds!!! 2 Thumbs up!!!
B00AE2LJVS|4.0|Good characters and some interesting plotlines (some of it based on a true story apparently) but the action only occurs in fits and starts and the movie drags a bit at times. Performances are solid.
B009FZHYKU|5.0|I love this show, and I was upset when i had to miss some episodes. Luckily, Amazon had them in a couple of days :D
0670033693|5.0|I wanted to read this book because I love the tv series. I think they do a great job with the series, but Mr. Johnson's books are incredible! As the first book in the series Cold Dish introduces you to all of the intricate facets of the main characters and the world they inhabit. I loaned my copy to one of my sisters and she couldn't put it down either. You will not be disappointed.
B0038TRGSY|5.0|I love this movie, and so does my daughter.  We rented movie for our trip.  The length of rental was good.
B00800WIK2|1.0|I received this product fine. My sone was excited to use it and tried it out right away. It worked maybe 2 of the 15 times my sone tried to play a game. Even after calibrating it several times. He would try and play a game, when pushing the buttons it did not work. He would take his IPhone out and double check to make sure it was in place properly and try again. This happened several times and we gave up and sent it back!!! DO NOT WASTE YOUR MONEY!!!!!
B00A6N7BS0|5.0|this movie was great lots of shooting and sex!!! Must see thumbs up hurah oh and weed too almost forgot
B00A0R0CG0|4.0|We all sat down and had a family movie day and this was one we watched, niceand clean funny and memorable!!
B004SJ3AXI|1.0|I hated this game and deleted it. Awful to work. I just don't get it, why everyone is so excited about angry birds.
B009YP9L7U|5.0|I enjoyed the book. Laughed out loud a few times.  If your looking for a fun book to read this is it.
B0076DELIG|4.0|Never disappointed with a Michale Connelly Book.  Can visualize each character.<br />It is an easy read with not too much information that is not relevent to the story
B00AMBK6J2|3.0|There are definitely some funny parts in the movie but it's not great or anything. I would say that it is worth watching though. The Boston accents are enough for a few good laughs.
B0085YNML2|5.0|I really like this game. Its not to hard. You have to swing from flowers to get stars. Different flowers do different things and there are different colors. Somes levels really make you think first. And some I have had to do over and over again. You can skip a level and go back to it later, which I like. My 4 year old tries to play, but most levels are to hard for him.
B004EPYZSU|4.0|I love watching movies with Harrison Ford and Daniel Craig, both great actors so I decided to buy this movie. I wasn't disappointed. I didn't think the aliens were the best they could come up with, they are much better in Star Wars or Star Trek.
B00A0ABQLM|5.0|[[VIDEOID:mo3N7LAZAT5FT1U]]☞ I'd like to first point out why I received this product:<br /><br />A short time ago, a Windows Update decided to mess with my BIOS settings, disabling my Lan card, AND all usb devices on boot, so I could not use my keyboard to get the BIOS, and at the time, I had no idea what happened, causing me to lose an entire day trying to solve the problem. Microsoft Support said: \\"Your port is broken\\", \\"nothing we can do\\", \\"not our fault\\".<br /><br />NOT TRUE<br />I figured out how to manually reset the BIOS with a CMOS reset switch, and finally had the ability to see what had been changed, and sure enough a WINDOWS UPDATE caused my Lan Card to be disabled. (Very irritating)<br /><br />☞ Onto my Review:<br />Cost: Inexpensive compared to most 3.0 USB to ether devices, and it comes with drivers that are separate from your internal Lan card: ☆☆☆☆☆ / ☆☆☆☆☆<br />Ease of Use: less than 5mins to install/setup. ☆☆☆☆☆ / ☆☆☆☆☆<br />Use: ☆☆ / ☆☆☆☆☆<br /><br />[Let me explain...this product is nice, and it's nice that it uses 3.0 for fast data transfer, as you'll need fast data transfer for a high speed network up to 1000 Mbps, and pretty low cost compared to other adapters, and has a nice design...but who would need this?]<br /><br /> ☛ Someone who's lan card may be corrupt or their ethernet port was destroyed.<br /> ☛ Someone who when building a computer doesn't want to pay for a network adapter.<br /> ☛ Someone (like me) who loses internet connection through a BIOS peripheral being disabled.<br /> ☛ Someone who does not have wi-fi on his/her router/modem, and somehow was not able to connect through their ethernet port.<br /> ☛ Someone who may want to connect to multiple Lan networks at the same time.<br /> ☛ Someone with more technical than I who sees a higher purpose using the 3.0 Gigabit speeds.<br /><br />Personally, I never lost internet connection, because I recently had bought awireless adapter (from the same company) which saved my butt. It seems as if, wireless adapters would cost less than this, but this allows for a direct ethernet line which would mean faster, and a faster more reliable connection.<br /><br />☞ My video explanation:<br />I took the ethernet cord from the back of my computer disabling my internet access to test the device. (that's why there's pictures) I also went more advanced, and disabled my Lan Card to see if this device was using my Lan Card or it's Lan Card drivers. Sure enough, it does use it's own Lan Card drivers which is something that's hard to find.<br /><br />Conclusion: ★★★★★ / ★★★★★<br />Nothing wrong with the device itself, and nothing wrong with the service I received.<br />It's inexpensive, and comes with it's own drivers which supports a independent network card through usb.<br />It supports USB 3.0 and 2.0 and up to 1000 Mbps, and is compatible with a few types of ethernet cords.<br /><br />In my opinion, the only \\"fault\\" to this product, is that it may not serve a purpose to most, so be sure you buy it for a purpose. If you have a wi-fi network, it might be better to get a less expensive Network Adapter if needed.<br /><br />-----------------------------------<br /><br />Questions:<br />What other uses may this serve to others? My knowledge of this product is very low, as I've never actually seen a ethernet cord being plugged into a USB port before. It's new, and unique, but is it worth it?
B007KQ6XYY|5.0|My children love this game! It helps with their cognitive development.  Try it out.  It's cool! Keeps their brain active.
B009ZE27US|5.0|weird app but Coll to.it awesome bra.aawweessoommee .it no sucked.game is Coll. it like Mario exsept with swords bra. :) Ps lt said I was 456.

B00AHSIQWE|5.0|Best of the series by Christopher Nolan, definitely a great one to round out the series while also leaving room for more movies in the future.
B00AMBH70S|5.0|But when it ended, I felt like I was read for it to start...  Awesome flick though, great action, intense.  I loved the characters too.
B0091REZMW|4.0|The game takes a bit to understand, but easily guides you to success.  You will be hooked after visiting a few rooms and finding the required items on the list.
B007PT3QOQ|2.0|Well as many said after the most recent update there are some serious glitches.  After I go past a certain point in any of the menu it just shuts off. Another issue I have is the energy... after around level fifty you really don't get an increase in energy till around level 110 and that only takes you up 5 to 55. I wish there was a way to increase your energy. Please fix it... I really was addicted before all this...
B003XF1XOQ|5.0|like a desert one cannot just stop eating--an excellent counter balance to more substantive reading materials: engrossing, absorbing, exciting, consuming.
B007EECSFA|5.0|Loved every moment of this book! Looking forward to more books from this author.  I was up late several nights, unable to put it down!
B00A7CF1QY|3.0|I enjoyed the movie all the way until three end. I couldn't believe it just abruptly ended like that. Kind of disappointing.
B001ANSSDC|5.0|This is the first Matthew Quick novel I've read and I really liked it.  The characters are excellent, the story sad and funny.  The conclusion is just right.  Pat is the main character who has had a mental breakdown and has been in a psyc hospital.  His long suffering, very understanding Mom moves him back home to take care of him; this is where the story begins.  Read it, you'll laugh and cry.  A great read.
B007IXWL2C|5.0|I love this book need more like it wonderful read I love Christian grey can't wait for the movie wow
0525951652|5.0|Well-researched, good story line, details about WWI I didn't know, excellent writing skills.  Would recommend this book to anyone who enjoys historical fiction.
B008TMA1LY|3.0|I didn't know when I got it that you had to literally spend money to buy extras.  The game itself is exciting.  Paying money to get more help, more tables etc. stinks!
B000RHMQBC|5.0|Directed by Martin Scorsese from Paul Schrader's semi-autobiographical script, TAXI DRIVER is depicts the emotional struggles of an self-isolated loser who through some cosmic joke becomes a hero after he attacks and murders three lowlifes. This when Travis Bickle's irrational plan to assassinate a presidential candidate at one of his rallies is thwarted by watchful Secret Service men.<br /><br />With nothing to fill his days with, ex-Vietnam vet Bickle accepts an overnight cabbie job that guarantees him very long hours. Unlike his fellow drivers, Travis is willing to take fares to the most dangerous areas of NYC. His brief friendship with an attractive gal ends badly and her rebuff sends him into a downward spiral of isolation and obsessive dreams of revenge against the decadent city he chooses to wander through. These sociopathic impulses play out in a most dramatic and explosive fashion.<br /><br />Ultimately, Travis appears to come out intact: calmer, seemingly sane, but one is left to wonder if he'll kill again someday.<br /><br />An undeniable modern classic and a chilling reflection of its bleak time. Features Bernard Herrmann's last film score, a darkly brooding jazz suite driven by saxman Tom Scott that nicely fits the story's mood.<br /><br />.<br />Parenthetical number preceding title is a 1 to 10 IMDb viewer poll rating.<br /><br />(8.5) Taxi Driver (1976) - Robert De Niro/Jodie Foster/Cybill Shepherd/Harvey Keitel/Peter Boyle/Albert Brooks/Leonard Harris/Joe Spinell/Martin Scorsese
B006ZAZ31U|5.0|This book is about a true hero.  A true role model for anyone that has personal struggles.  This guy is the best example of selfless service.  Adams face should be the definition of warrior and hero.  If you like military story this might be the best every.  If you like personal stories of coming from the bottom and seeing your way to success this is the book for you.  If you know someone battling personal demons this book is for them.
B00914JWSW|3.0|I love Barbara's singing...this CD was okay but not one I would rate more than 3 stars.  I was not overly impressed with the songs and I definitely had a problem with the background talking around some of the songs.  Hopefully, the next release(s) will be top-notched as only she normally produces.
B004SJ3BCI|4.0|Never having played this before I thought it was a pretty fun game. I'm not real game-savvy so it was right up my alley!
0446580848|1.0|this is a sad effort by De mille, boring , long winded,I had rerad 80% of the book on my kindle and nothing had happened, The Panther was missing in non action, a terrble read, a travel log would be a better description. Cliff
B008JGSM6G|4.0|Fun, easy game to play. I'm sure some of the higher levels get more challenging, but just starting out its just right for me!
B009J2VQSK|5.0|I do not understand why people review movie soundtrack CD's if they have not seen the movie. In this case its impossible to understand the context within each song/track are used. Anyway, yes, the music on this CD is quite varied but works well with this amazing film. I do like the Danny Elfman tracks and \\"Silver Lining\\" by Jesse J. The duet of \\"Girl From the North Country\\" is used in a very poignant moment in the film. I still remeber the moment in the film when this music was used. Go see this film-don't miss it and then this music will make sense. There have been a lot of great films this year and this one is one of the best.
B006KX3GXO|5.0|Ive tried so many other photo editing app and was constantly diappointed until i found this. Its a really great app. No other photo editing app compares to picsart :D
B008D28HYS|5.0|Great take on a picross puzzle game. Good variety of levels too. Would recommend this. This has.kept.me.up late many a night because I wanted to finish a picture.
B009FZFONO|5.0|I love it!, thanks for having it on HD! I am so happy that I was able to watch season 3
B002N83GYE|2.0|This book was very disappointing. I thought that it could have been a lot better. There are many other books on Steve Jobs that I highly recommend that I think people will enjoy a lot more. Overall, this book falls short.
B009329ZF2|4.0|The trailers and advertising did not help much to promote this movie. I definitely recommend to watch it to appreciate this adventurous, fantastic and yet romantic story. Acting is great, special effects are very good. Enjoy!
B009WO7NQO|5.0|My son, 8, loves all the angry birds apps. It really keeps him occupied on long road trips. I recommend this app!
B00A0SKFLG|4.0|I opt for the Terminator, without denying Farrel Colin any quality, however this remake totally over shadows the original version, and for obvious reasons. To begin with the cutting off the Martian scenario is a better reflection to the times we could be living in a possible next future. Today we are certain that Mars will not be colonized for another century or so, we are deeply exploring the possibility to produce a cybernetic entity, and the planet's population growing at incredible speed might give you an idea of the future, or should I say a possible future. I found quite interesting that huge elevator connecting two extremities of the planet, however it seems a bit far fetched that it could go trough Earth core harmlessly, but then again this is sci-fi, and with sci-fi anything goes. Acting is excellent. Special effects: fabulous. Maybe the fighting action is a bit exaggerated. I recommend to must see.
B009SJ3GUK|5.0|American horror story season 2 does not disappoint in any way and Amazon delivers it to my account the next day after it runs, commercial free and ready to stream on my roku. I could not be happier!
B009NQKPUW|3.0|I read a lot of comments and critiques on Prometheus, and most of it was not to good. Funny, because I loved the other  Alien movies, and I was deceived by the complexity of this last achievement. I too found it created too many unanswered questions and like many others I am of the opinion that Prometheus is the first of a triplet that Cameron is cooking up and not telling us. Let's wait and see. Special effects were beautiful and I loved the space ship Prometheus as much I liked the Nostromo and the Sulacco, of the previous movies. Acting was great!
B0094BB4TW|1.0|Would have rated this app lower than 1 star, if it was possible. Same complaint as the majority of other users:  Newsfeed doesn't work properly.  You'd think a multi-billion dollar company like FB would be able to produce a simple mobile app that actually worked!?! What a joke!
B009HEJXFS|4.0|I gave MIB3 4 stars for its level of entertainment and fantasy. As usual the cast is impeccable, the special effects are well done and finally the story follows the trend usual to MIB movies. Can't wait to see the next one... there has to be a next!
B008Y2FRFO|5.0|hands down. Got a kindle for Xmas downloaded this the first day and have not stopped playing since!!! The challenge is in not trying to pay for comic. ;)
B000FCKC4C|5.0|Very simple story but very insightful...I will read it again!  I am surprised I missed this 10 years ago but very glad I caught it on its anniversary.
B004DLPXAO|5.0|Works fine for me.  I have it on my phone, it seems to do the job.  I think also it's the one I put on my Nexus 7.  I do use the app almost every day.
B004LQI1PA|5.0|I can't say enough about this production.  I have seen this play 3 times (my brother has seen it 5 times all over the world) and this is a superior presentation using cast members from all of the major productions.  Worth the time to watch it!
B009HEJXFS|3.0|This movie is ok but not what I was expecting. To me it did not live up to MIB levels.
031603441X|1.0|This book has some interesting information but it's obvious Richards would rather revise history at the expense of people he hates rather than keep his story straight and tell the truth, thereby contradicting himself in the process. Case in point--Brian Jones. In this book Richards has decided to reverse himself and claim Ian Stewart rather than Brian Jones was the band's visionary, \\"glue\\" and decision-maker. In his 1971 Rolling Stone interview, Richards states \\"Brian was the one who kept us all together\\" in the early days. In \\"Life,\\" Richards decides to write that Ian Stewart \\"was the spark and energy and organization that actually kept it together in the early days.\\" Sorry, but I'll believe the 1971 interview, which seems much more credible because (1) it took place much closer in time to the events discussed, and (2) contains far less venom than \\"Life\\". Richards in 1971: \\"Brian at that time [mid-1963] is the leader of the band. He pulled us all together...\\" and \\"He got us together, Charlie, Mick and Me.\\" Richards states in Stanley Booth's 'True Adventures of the Rolling Stones' that \\"In the early Summer [of 1962], Brian decided to get a band together. So I went round to this rehearsal...\\" Richards in \\"Life\\": \\"It was his [Ian Stewart's] vision, the band, and basically he picked who was going to be in it.\\" No, Stu didn't pick who was in the band, it was Jones, as evidenced by Richards' own words in Booth's book: \\"Brian doesn't know what to do, kick me out and keep it together with these cats or kick those two out and have a band again.\\"<br /><br />In \\"Life\\" Richards often contradicts himself, sometimes on facing pages within the book: \\"Brian thought it was his band for some weird reason\\" shortly later: \\"In the early negotiations, it was always Brian who would go to our meeting as our leader. We were not permitted--by Brian\\"<br /><br />As for being a hypocrite, Richards complains in \\"Life\\" about Brian Jones' illness and not showing up for gigs. \\"When you're schlepping around 350 days a year and you've got to drag a dead weight it becomes pretty vicious\\" Fast-forward to the 70's when Richards' own *voluntary* drug use (not illness) literally ground the band's activities to a halt. For example, \\"My trial was finally heard in Toronto in 1978. We knew it might sink us all...\\"<br /><br />If Richards would direct some of his viciousness at himself for his own actions, he wouldn't come off sounding like such an adolescent. A compilation of all the reversals Richard makes in this book compared to  earlier statements would be entertaining to say the least.
B009IEXKXI|4.0|I would start by saying this book was great, but that would be an understatement.  It starts off after the events that caused Mark Watney to be left stranded and presumably dead during Ares 3.  From there, it's a constant thrill ride.  Andy did a really great job of making Mark Watney a \\"real person\\" and not just a character in a book.  This book is definitely worth the $0.99 purchase price.  Read it.  Now.
B0083DJWGO|4.0|Very good book. A seemingly simple concept, anti-fragile, is at the core of so much. Well explained and developed, humorous and insightful. I liked it and recommend it to anyone who is curious about the world we live in.
B0017I1IZA|5.0|Always fun to read her book.  Love to learn more about the Plum family and how Stepanie solves the mysteries
B0076DELIG|4.0|i am a big fan of Michael Connelly., but lately some of his books seem tired.  he sure came back to life with this one. a very detailed and insightful look at the work needed to solve a mystery, especially an older one. Connelly's characters are at the top of their game and Harry's attitude is still with us. good dialogue, good story, well told.
B009JBZH54|5.0|the picture and sound qualities are just superb...<br />Nolan does justice to all three of the batman movies<br />and the storyline is well developed
B000UZQI0Q|2.0|The 1st book in the series, Mistborn, is magnificent.  It introduces a whole new system of magic, a fascinatingly immortal bad guy emperor, and tantalizing journal entries at the start of each chapter.  And if the characters are a bit simplistic, that is ok, they are fun and interesting, and the story moves along nicely.<br /><br />Book two, The Well of Ascension, essentially has only the simplistic characters.  It even re-uses the SAME previously tantalizing journal entries at the top of each chapter--which (surprise, surprise) go from fascinating to really boring when you see the exact same entries a second time.  I did finish reading the book, so it does not deserve 1 star, but I am annoyed with myself for finishing.<br /><br />I highly recommend reading Mistborn--and then stop reading the series.
B002NZTZ8S|5.0|My 3 year old loves trains so this was the perfect movie for him to watch and learn more about Christmas, in a way I couldn't explain. Definitely a good family movie!
B00AMBLDEE|5.0|Great acting and constant action. More surprising and not predictable. Perfect casting, especially in the lead female role. Interesting but subtle connections to the other Jason Bourne flicks.
B004ZZS4CC|3.0|After seeing this young woman on television talk shows, I felt so bad for her and grabbed her book. The first part where she discusses her life before, during and after the ordeal was what I wanted to hear of the story and what she couldn't talk about on TV. A most amazing young woman who lost her childhood from a horrible couple while walking on the way to her bus stop. How she could endure all this in such a young naive girls mind is disheartening. The last few chapters were a bit boring for me,after she told her entire story and how she was relating to today's world with now a couple children to bring up. Always hear that the abducted often relate with their abductors especially when their children. So naive they don't know they can yell, scream or run away which is frustrating. Felt bad for her, she still has a way to go in learning about life and bringing up children now that its all over. To take away the childhood of an innocent child is horrible. I wish her and her babies well.
B008Z9YGEE|4.0|I had read the first 2 books of the trilogy before watching the movie. Unlike most book-movie adaptations this one was pretty successful. While the book focuses on Katniss's point of view, her feelings/thoughts/fears, the movie focuses more on the games themselves. Skipping over the romanticism and the relationships among the characters as well as the history of panem. No need to read the book before watching the movie but if you are thinking of reading the books the movie is a good introduction.
B007IXWKUK|5.0|OMG!!!!!  I wondered if #2 would be any better or just a continuance of the same ol'thing. Oh no, it got better and it made me happy to keep the story going, answering more questions on the Christen and Ana relationship.  His demons are going to wreck their relationship if he doesn't get it together, but then who cares in the moment, this man is the epitomy of romance...slow, sweet, romance under total erotic elements anytime and anywhere. She's really getting into some of his kinky mannerisms, and he's starting to release his former life that can't hold a candle to the love he feels for this succulent morsel of femininity. The wrench gets throw in when former subs come into his life.  This guy is so awesome they all want to return to his bed.  Don't blame them! Men should also read this and learn a few things! To live vicariously through Ana...oh yes!
B00A8Z6KN8|3.0|This is a wonderful piece of music and takes you straight back to watching the movie, as each track takes you on the journey again.<br /><br />However, this soundtrack suffers from the fact that you need to listen to it from start to finish.  There are no repeatable tracks that sound right out of context of the overall thing.  Really, it should be a single track of a couple of hours long.
B007J4T2G8|5.0|Heard so much about this book, had some time over the holidays to read it. Well...I read it in 3 nights.  Had a difficult time putting it down!  What is this Christen guy and will Ana and he get together.  He keeps telling her she'll regret any relationship they enter. That would have scared me and I'd have run!  Getting to this relationship was awesome and it made me wonder if this is a smart move on her part, maybe he's right, he's a devil in disguise....  This book kept me spell-bound and I couldn't wait to finish it.  Then when I did, I WANTED MORE!  Rich, sultry, erotic, leaving me with a definite glow~  Did I mention erotic...oh yes it was. I'm an author and I am so in awe of E.L. James.
B0076DELIG|5.0|Harry at his best, jumping the system, internal affairs all over him, a Houdini trick and maybe a new lady--good reading!
B009YP9L7U|5.0|This book places you right inside the story made by Megan &Conner's love, taking you through every emotion.  The love, passion, and raw emotion they experience take you over every cliff and keeps you wanting more.
034580404X|5.0|I just loved all these books.  Took me about 2 weeks to read them all.  They have gone through 7 other of my friends and all the pages are falling out. Wish there were more books out there like these ones.  Great love story.
B0034DGPEU|4.0|I had a hard time putting this book down.  Characters are wonderfully developed.  Good discussion for book clubs using history and social interactions.  Really enjoyed!
B008JGSM6G|5.0|This app is surprisingly fun and addictive. I did not expect it to be a game that I wouldn't want to put down. I have it on my phone too and let a coworker play it and get I didn't get my phone back til the end of the  day and they were fighting over playing on my phone. True story. All who could have now downloaded it and the others have  more people to borrow phones from.
B005MXQD5Q|5.0|Loved it!  Saw part of this program on PBS and had to have it.  The man with the golden voice.
B003CSV7TK|5.0|Cannot help but love this movie...great memories...sent to my niece's family for their family Christmas celebration and tradition...great  never fails to deliver
B005GFPZYK|5.0|An amazing story about an incredibly brave soldier. Thank You to all the service men and women that have kept and continue to keep us safe.
B0099G6Q5E|5.0|Love the movie and the soundtrack is amazing. If you like a-cappella, this is a CD for you! I would recommend the film and soundtrack to anyone.
B000JMKQX0|4.0|Not really sure what I expected from the book after seeing the movie trailer, but the one thought that kept going through my mind was &#34;how are they going to make a movie out of this book?&#34;.  Notwithstanding, I really enjoyed the book.  At various times it made me cry, pissed me off, left me sad and a little hopeful at the same time.  The only negative was the constant looking at the index to see what a word or event meant.  I felt the author could have just put it in (parenthesis), but that may have just been because it was supposed to read more like a briefing than a book.  I will say at times I had to keep reminding myself it wasn't real.
B001HBYHFA|5.0|Well made, and excellent acting. A joy to watch with an immersive story line. One word to summ it up &#34;Shiny&#34;
072325804X|5.0|All the biggest stories created and drawn by Beatrix. The paintings are beautiful, well printed, and published by the original publisher. A book that is good to have at home, even if you don't have children.
B00APUYWYA|5.0|Rebel Wilson is so funny in this movie...Good cast along side her...Will be watching again...Music is not bad...Check it out
B006LSZECO|4.0|Very well written novel. Kept  you interested with all the twists. The only reason I didn't give it a five star rating  is I felt a let down with the ending.
0385535147|5.0|This is a page turner and a fast read.  The plots, sub plots, and hidden twists that Mr. Grisham has created keep you hooked until the surprise ending!
145210655X|5.0|This was the perfect gift for a family member who adores Star Wars and is a parent of a young child. Jeffrey Brown hits it right on the money. Bravo!
1439102430|3.0|It's well written, however the subject matter of infanticide was disturbing to me.  So, be forewarned before you buy it.
B00A9C3RB8|5.0|FUNNY, FUNNY!  Loved the theme, and especially loved Tommy Lee Jones in this.  It's unusual to see him in such a funny role, but he - as always - did it like the pro he is.  Love his acting!  Meryl Streep is also always a great actress.  She was totally right on the money with her acting.  It's one of the few movies I would see again.
B00127RAJY|4.0|I got three jillian michaels dvd's. They all came pretty quickly and I was happy about that. It is a pretty difficult workout, so if you are a beginner, I suggest either going with something else, or expect to not make it all the way through the first few times at least. That being said, it is a great workout and will help you lose pounds, assuming you have the healthy diet to go with it.
B005ZUR724|1.0|I really like this game but gameloft really has problems with most of there games. I really hope they fix this phantom update thing. like most people I injoyed it for 2 days after this phantom update came up. Its a really good game but bad company. I'v bought many of gamlofts game and &quot; to my surprise &quot; they all have problems why does gameloft keep screwing us over? why?<br />I recommend buying or getting free games from glue. there much more better with updates and bug fixes. They dont have better games but at least they work.
B007THA4FI|5.0|As always JK is a great writer. It was a very fast download. I have read it several time now.
B009FZHYKU|5.0|I am addicted to this show. If not for amazon I would have to wait until the season was over befor watching it.
B0052TDGQO|5.0|Scotty is amazing and his voice is definitely Country.  I am so glad that he has made it in the music industry.  The product was shipped and delivered as promised.  Thank you
B009FZHYKU|5.0|Albeit, sourced from comic books. With the constant recycling of old ideas for tv shows, this is a refreshed take on armageddon. Some might say that there have been a lot of copies of \\"Night of the Living Dead. This may be true, but this show and the two \\"28\\" films are the most imaginative of the genre.
B009SJ3H8Q|5.0|what a season opener & only gets better with each show. Don't miss season 1  either.  You will be hooked form the beginning.
B004J64QR4|4.0|I can't compare it to the 10th anniversary edition, since I haven't seen that, although I now plan to. In fact, I was only familiar with the book. However, I did see the live stage version, I've seen some remarks about the stage version. AFAIK, the 25th was only presented in concert format. With the exception of the closeups and, of course, the encores, this version is what I saw on stage. The strong points were the performances of Boe, Lewis, Salonga and Karimloo. I can't really add much to what's been already said about Jonas. I'm merely a competent tenor and I realized suddenly while listening that I have more resonance and projection than he. He was actually worse in the live performance. His voice got lost much more there. I think they actually enhanced him a bit for this recording.<br /><br />One more petty gripe caused me to subtract a star. The video quality was not what I expected, so far as resolution. I watched the cloud version on a new computer with a 24&#34; LED monitor. I understand the quality on the 10th anniversary version is worse, so I may just buy that CD.
B0076DELIG|5.0|I loved this book, and Harry Bosch. I would like to see more of the Harry Bosch books! Keep writing
B005NJU8PA|2.0|Though some of it is fun and some of it helpful it mostly feels like the author took everything he knew a little about and used it to fill space.  The writing is punchy, opinionated, egocentric and  an easy read.  It feels more like a Google search than a book.
B009OYSFDM|5.0|For a superhero, this guy is so excellent!  Love that he actually has a life and relationships that matter.  He and his sidekick are super to watch :-)
B002P79KAC|5.0|Funny in the extreme, sweet in part, and true in spirit to all us nerds. If you don't like it, you were probably a jock in high school.
B009IJJ5B4|5.0|This is a really smart, fun show.  I can't wait for the new episodes to come out!  Sherlock Holmes has never been better!
B001KPK6Q2|5.0|Excellent interpretations. Her voice is amazing and her songs are filled with so much emotion, that it left me stunned. People that love romantic and country music with feeling will enjoy this album, like me and my daughter did.
B008HK3XU4|4.0|I especially like the elastic closure that keeps the case from falling open. I also like that you can easily charge the Kindle while it is in the case. Color is much to my liking.
075669812X|5.0|My 3 & 4 year old nephews love these. They are both huge Ninjago fans, and were very excited to read about the characters and get the green Ninjago!
B007N5YIUS|4.0|Fun, as I find all &#34;Birds&#34; games. It is a little easier than others I have played, but sometimes it is refreshing to be able to win on the first try! Good for the ego!<br />Ads do not bother me in the least. I like being able to play for free.<br />Suggestion: Why not offer limited free play (like sample books) on some games so we could see if we would want to purchase?
B006WQLH7G|4.0|Installed with no problems.<br />Does not appear to slow down my Polaroid tablet.<br />Only had it running 2 days but no plroblems so far.
B004SJ3BCI|4.0|My first time playing computer games. This one has been a little challenging for me. Maybe this is a good thing.
B007HACDLK|4.0|Vince Flynn is back.  His last novel was subpar, but The Last Man is another solid read.  If you are a fan of Mitch Rapp you will enjoy this book.
B0086700CM|3.0|I didn't like the type of game this was -- running to escape and having to turn corners, jump over things, etc. Of course,  I am new to computer games. May like it better when I get tired of &#34;Birds&#34;!
B004LWZWGK|1.0|I'd only recommend this movie to you under two circumstances. 1. You enjoy huge plot holes and nonsensical action. 2. You are a Nolanite (a person who has a fetish for Christopher Nolan).<br /><br />Other wise watch Batman (1988), Batman Returns, Batman Begins, or Dark Knight for your Batman fix.
B007URVZJ6|5.0|This book is truly all one needs to format and publish an e-book on Kindle. Clear and concise are the step by step instructions within. Thankfully missing from the text is the all to prevalent ounce of tripe that separates the professional from the wannabe. Download this booklet, study the clearly outlined formatting instructions and you shall need no other.
B009WO7NQO|5.0|I was in hysterics playing this game.  I laughed and played and laughed and played the whole game in one sitting.  Can't wait for the next &#34;Angry Birds&#34; game.

B000077VR3|5.0|My daughter specifically requested this dvd as a Christmas gift.  She loves it, and has told me on many occasions that the actors have excellent chemistry on screen, and portray their characters with such depth of feeling.<br />She has told me that she has cried each time she watched this movie, so if you want an evocative, tear-jerker of a movie, get this flick.  I feel that if it stirs emotions, whether happy or sad, it is a good film.  If you feel nothing, it isn't worth the money or the time.  SO, this is good film to watch, for the emotion, for the cinematography, for the cast.
B00AFWEPVI|3.0|I just can't figure out how to delete pictures off of the app when I decide I don't want to keep them
B007ZGO7EM|5.0|I think the kindle calculator is super brill. It is the best calculator ever. I really reccomend this for kindle users
0345803507|1.0|not worth your money, these are not for children, they are really trashy so save your money...  I DIDN'T REALIZE JUST WHAT THEY WERE..SAW SO MANY ADDS FOR THEM.
B009S8PEHY|5.0|This collection includes many traditional Christmas songs sung by Rod in a more mellow style than what I am used to hearing from him, but exactly right for this type of music.
B001OGWY1W|4.0|I enjoyed the Dark Knight, including the late Heath Ledger who played the Joker and Christian Bale who played Batman. Can't wait Batman Rises w/ bad guy Bane.
B007ZGO7EM|5.0|I never knew how often I needed a calculator until I downloaded this one. Simple design and easy to use. The % key is especially helpful.
B00785P2QC|3.0|Its a wonderful simulation. With my personal pro-con list, its a lot more enjoyable to me. Its downside is the time to redeem enough \\"cash \\" to buy additional property.
B007Q0OV6Q|5.0|I bought this for each of my boys, ages 11 and 14, this December.  They had a different one last year.  I was really happy that Lego makes a variety of Star Wars Advent calendars.  My boys LOVE it!  Every morning, while eating breakfast, they open and assemble their daily \\"discovery.\\"  One son is a LEGO fan and the other loves Star Wars.  Lego Advent calendars are pricy, but worth it!
B0083P1QUM|5.0|What can I say!!  It is an excellent book and I have read all of Patricia Cornwell's books and always find them to be very interesting.
B0038P59A0|3.0|The thing I didn't care for was it did not follow the story line of Sherlock Holmes very well.  Sherlock was nonviolent in the book.  There was a lot going on, and it was engaging and interesting, but more like an action adventure than a mystery.
B008YWY0HK|5.0|My daughter just loves this one, and so do I. It is a really neat story with laughter and seriousness all wrapped up om this one little flick.
1452656304|3.0|This was the audio book of the story.<br />It was OK, but I felt like it was too long.<br />I was glad to get the chance to listen to it,<br />but it had quite a different feel then the movie.
B004LWZWGA|5.0|This is a good movie, and we are able to enjoy it as much as we like at home, would recommend it to others.
0756686970|5.0|We bought this book for a brother's step son.  After he opened it I was jealous about the depth of the Lego universe and how much it has grown in 25 years!<br /><br />This book is very OCD in the fact that it shows all the Lego characters made around the Star Wars universe.  It even shows rare versions and lists minor changes in different releases.  It even lists what movie the character is from (I - VI, Clone, Extended).<br /><br />This book is great for any Lego AND Star Wars fan.
B00004XMTJ|5.0|This is such an awesome DVD. Can enjoy it over and over. Would recommend this DVD to all. Worth every penny.
B00574P9EQ|5.0|My boys loved the books and wanted the movies for Christmas. They are a great kid friendly story, especially relatable to my three boys. Great quality.
B000V63BN6|5.0|Could not ask for a better deal when this was 2.99! Needed some Stevie and this fixed it. If want a greatest hits album this about covers it. The only thing missing is Isn't she lovely.
B007VUA7VO|5.0|Outstanding. It does everything I required and more. It takes away the guess work and makes an already enjoyable product even better.
B005GSZZ1A|5.0|A captivating REAL story in an age where realism seems absent.<br />I recommend this book. The author includes historical information about Korea - a bonus.
B004EBZX6W|3.0|This is a great app that could easily earn 5 stars. Unfortunately, the developer seems to have chosen to keep it ad based rather than offering a paid, ad-free version, and I find ads to be a serious turn-off in any app. I'm so sick of seeing blurry in-app ads for a local car dealer I've sworn never, ever, to do business with them. Ever. Seriously. (Yes, I mean YOU Pohanka Hyundai) In fact, I can't recall ever actually seeing an in-app advertisement that made me want to buy whatever product they were selling, but I can think of dozens of apps I've looked at and then removed because they were ad based. Most such ads are poorly done, difficult to actually read on such a small screen, and block portions of the app you're trying to use, and that's exactly the case with this app. Sorry, that makes this app worth, maximum, 3 stars to me.

B004EPZ0AM|5.0|my granddaughters must watch movie.  every time she comes over she wants to watch this movie.  Almost wore me out on it.  3 years old
B00A6PD9I4|5.0|The characters were brilliant!  I loved the Scottish accents and the story!  The main character was a real fireball!  I am hoping to score this DVD for Christmas!
B007ZGO7EM|4.0|This is a basic calculator and is very useful to make a little bit more sophisticated calculations like achieve calculations in the  scientific and or business field. There are quite a few available in the internet and it should be only be adapted to the android environment.
B0041C1ZXE|5.0|While taking sonic cues from the past, Tame Impala take psychedelic music to a new place.  The tracks are well laid out and very well recorded.  It's amazing when young artists make a collection of works that are this well informed, groovy, and continuously interesting.  This LP is a must buy.
1451688091|5.0|I truly believe that as American citizens, we have a responsibility to understand out form of government and our history.  Perhaps the most important part of this, after the revolutionary period, is the Civil War period and the presidency of Abraham Lincoln, who wrought great changes in the fabric of our society and in the sphere of politics, laws and governance.  To understand Lincoln and how he accomplished his greatest achievements, one must know and understand the man and how he thought... His philosophy ... His passions.... His ability to engage others and how he dealt with adversity.<br />The author of this book has examined Lincoln and all of these things at a time when our politicians are as unproductive uctive and uninspiring as they have ever been in our country's history.  The contrast between our current leaders and those in. The time of Lincoln is glaring... And she seems to be telling us that we all could take a page out of their books to be brave and make the toughest decisions. To understand when to compromise and when to stand firm.. Mst of all to think carefully about the ramifications of our decisions.<br />The movie is a spectacular representation of only a very small part of this book.
B0073LWEXK|4.0|Almost worth 5 stars. It could use an introductory summary. Very good graphics, works smoothly, demands intuitive thinking. Great on a Kindle Fire when you have a few free moments to do nothing important..
B008B4KVS8|3.0|I remember seeing this movie when I was a kid and it's not too bad even now.  Some of the special effects show their age (particularly jets flying at the end), but the movie is still good fun.  Fairly good action and if you haven't seen it before, keeps you guessing as to who the bad guy will turn out to be in the end.  Family friendly.  Wouldn't pay more than ten bucks for it, but I do recommend it.
B00AQ3K8IU|5.0|I almost don't trust myself to write this review because I'm pretty sure...no, I know it will be impossible for me to put into words the experience of Hopeless.<br /><br />The title in itself is packed with irony because every single thing about this book is...more. I felt this book before I even finished the first chapter. Yes, the story is dark, but this type of beauty doesn't need light to be seen. This type of beauty is meant to be felt, experienced. Hopeless is beautiful and I felt every single part of it.<br /><br />Colleen Hoover's attention to detail develops the story and gives it life. I'm not talking about detailed descriptions; I'm talking about those small personalized touches that make a story real. Those little pieces that seem completely random until you finally realize that they all fit together perfectly, flawlessly.<br /><br />I apologize for being too lazy to look up another word in my thesaurus, but the characters were perfect. I loved Sky's unabashed honesty. I felt everything right along with her...everything. Some of the situations she found herself in were hilarious! I was uncomfortable. I was embarrassed. I was heartbroken. I was hearthealed. I was emotionally connected to everything that was happening in the story.<br /><br />Holder. He was...I--I don't have the words. Holder...I just can't. He was...he was simply amazing. Everything about him, perfect. Every single thing that came out of his mouth was dripping with so many different emotions that I'm...I melted every single time he spoke. Every. Time.<br /><br />The physical connection between Holder and Sky made it difficult to breathe; the moments of intense passion, emotion, feeling. I needed the descriptive nature of those scenes (not because I'm a pervert), but because I needed to feel the emotion. I needed to feel...everything. I felt everything. It brought a level of intimacy that left me speechless.<br /><br />I love how you think you have it all figured out...until you don't. We're easily let to figure out some things, but then slammed with something we didn't see coming. It's emotionally charged from beginning to end. Don't be scared of the dark issues. There are emotions that without pain are impossible to experience. They are beautiful emotions because they come from healing. They come from a heart that has been broken, damaged. A heart that has been put back together. Sky and Holder broke me, but then they put me back together. These emotions are the most beautiful and intense emotions that you can feel. This book allows us to experience that; to feel everything. It is something to be thankful for and I am truly thankful for every part of it.<br /><br />I don't care if you're a fan of erotica, contemporary, romance, fantasy, YA, or fairy porn. This book will deliver something for EVERYONE! Hopeless took a part of me with it, but it gave me a piece of it in return. A piece I will keep forever and ever.

B007704PRU|4.0|I started reading this as soon as I finished Delirium and I found the first quarter of the book a little tedious, if not a little boring.  But eventually the story caught me and I starting loving it.  Cannot wait for the 3rd book!!!
B00992CF6W|5.0|Minecraft pe is the best game I've ever played besides the real minecraft. Don't listen to those bad reviews. This game has been number one on Apple android and now Amazon!!!! Keep up the good work Mojang keep the updates coming.
B0043VDIAG|5.0|Just finished reading this last night - I could not put this book down.  This is a great story with interesting characters and plot.  If you love a bit of a love story with a bit of a dark side, give this one a go.
B003YL4LYI|3.0|Mr. Martin prolongs the magic with another meaty tome that mostly page count and little action. Extraneous plot threads are summarily extinguished as not a whole lot happens to the protagonists of the story. I'm guessing the publisher and/or author thought the reading public (both of them) would gobble up anything written in the Westoros universe so long as it had Martin's name on it.
B00866H7SS|3.0|I did really enjoy this book but just as an easy to read kind of book.  It kept me interested and entertained so I'd probably give it 3.5 stars if half stars were allowed.
B005K17RU0|4.0|I like this app. I use it daily, of course. Having the temp show down in the right hand corner of my galaxy tab is very handy.
B004KZOXJA|5.0|Absolutely fell in love with this story and could not put it down.  Have been recommending it to my friends and they've loved it too.  I have such a vivid picture in my head of the characters and the setting and would love to see it as a movie.
B0016JBCJW|5.0|I really enjoyed the humor and interplay between the three brothers in this movie as well as a great ending.
B008GVD6D8|3.0|I did really enjoy this book but just as an easy to read kind of book.  It kept me interested and entertained so I'd probably give it 3.5 stars if half stars were allowed.
B005HSG3VK|5.0|For the price, it's built well and my mom, who I bought this for, loves it. It works just as described and the casing is solid. I don't know if anyone has had a problem with the stand but it is simple to use and she's had no problems using it. She's 75 and she loves this case.
098478280X|5.0|This book covers all the important topics required for coding interviews. Not as useful for Program/Project Manager type questions (which are more process oriented, from my experience), but you should definitely read this if you are preparing in addition to http://www.amazon.com/s/ref=nb_sb_ss_i_0_14?url=search-alias%3Daps&field-keywords=programming+interviews+exposed&sprefix=programming+in%2Caps%2C255
B00ADYY7MA|5.0|Excellent music for both country and non-country music fans.  Huge fan of the show and music is one of the reasons why.
B004WY2M8I|5.0|Some of the best books I ever read!! I cant stop reading  I cant wait to read what's going to happen next!! Definitely A Top Notch series!!!
B00APUYWYA|5.0|A cute movie with good music. Glee worthy singing. Cute rom-com plot. Hilarious writing. Funny enough the boyfriend will like it.<br /><br />Worth it.
B004DLPXAO|3.0|Why do the apps that Amazon makes themselves update faster on the Google Play Store than they do on Amazon's own App Store?  Also, why does it this app even show up in my Play Store app list when I installed it from here?
B000T433CO|3.0|has its moments.  Acting not bad, if you in the mood for a christmas movie would recommend for a laugh
B004UJAOLM|5.0|This movie was amazing and now I am reading the book.  I highly recommend it. You will enjoy both the movie an book.
B004J4WKTW|5.0|One of the most interesting reads I've encountered for a long time.  Allows the reader to imagine the fantastic space created by the characters.  It's nice to encounter a well written book that expects only that the reader use her imaginiation.  You will NOT be disappointed!
B0085P2Z6E|5.0|totally love this game. love the strategy. I SPEND HOURS GOING THRU EACH CHAPTER AND SOLVING EACH PUZZLE. _<br />'would like to see more apps like this one.
B0070Y46UY|4.0|just enjoyed it. nothing extra special i like these kind of stories. life of pi was writen for quick reading.
B0085YNML2|5.0|This is a great little puzzle game. The levels start off fairly simple and get much harder as you progress. You really have to think about the timing, colors, distance, and goal.
B005LLSNNE|5.0|I love every season of Sons of Anarchy, I'm addicted to it! I recommend that everyone watch this show, all 5 seasons!
B0064TVQ5E|4.0|I'm a Mahjong addict. It's kind of hard to make out the differences of the tiles because they are so small but good game. Was confusing at first because I&#34;m used to different tile patterns but great game when you get used to them.
0735204551|5.0|The rating fits the way I feel!!!!!!!!!!!!  I like it be cause it make me feel good and happy when i read it
B004SJ3BCI|5.0|Great to kill some time. Challenging fun levels. Lots of levels for a free game. My kids and I both enjoy.
B008ASLK8A|5.0|The movie was very enjoyable. I thought it was better than the first one.  Would recommend to everyone.  A great movie for the entire family.
B000YHG72E|5.0|It is so wonderful I have watched it 3 times since I bought it with my great grandchildren so very good!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
B009NPKTN6|5.0|excellent music: the pantheon of excellent rock songs!!!!<br /><br />soooooo much good music it's sobering<br /><br />excellent renditions as well.<br /><br />i absolutely recommend this movie
B009VL299E|5.0|Metallica has been one of my favorite bands for many years... from Live S***, Cunning Stunts, S&M, Nimes, and Mexico City, I have a lot of their live DVDs. This one probably has the best audio/video quality and even some pretty cool packaging.    The main reason for my purchase: the set list. Yes, there are 10 songs that were already on the Nimes DVD... but there are 16 songs that were not. Even cuts from the Garage sessions! Basically, I saw \\"Damage Inc.\\" on their website and went straight to the record store. \\"The Shortest Straw\\" was awesome, too.    I have no qualms with the band's performance, either. They've built a legendary reputation off their relentless touring. They've been going hard for a long, long time, so I'll accept the imperfections and be grateful that they keep giving us awesome new set lists on DVD!    PS - Props for doing this one indie style!
B002FQOI0A|5.0|Madeline L'Engle's Wrinkle in Time was one of my all time favorite books. I LOVE how Rebecca Stead uses this book to put a tiny wrinke in my time of reading. I couldn't put it down.
B009SJ3GUK|5.0|This show is absolutely amazing. It combines a new type of scary while tipping its hat to the classic greats. The way that they are able to balance all the subplots is beyond me. Jessica Lange is so badass in everyway
B009GEBBNQ|1.0|I rate this movie with only one star because of video streaming issues at Amazon. I understand the entire Internet isn't under Amazon's control but it seems I don't have nearly as many issue with good old Netflix.<br /><br />I saw the movie at the theater and it is a 5+ Star movie but my nephews will never know that because of the problems watching it via Amazon online.
B009A3NGF4|5.0|Every track on this album is wonderful.  The bonus tracks are well worth the extra $2.00.  i would recommend this album to everyone!
B004J4WKUQ|3.0|This book describes a post apocalyptic  world which primarily lived through a virtual reality universe.  It's like World of Warcraft on a much grander scale.  The story is fun to read with a great retro component.  Without any major plot twists, the story is somewhat predictable.
B007SGLZP8|5.0|I read all of Grishams books. Sometimes it is hard to guess an ending . But, I had this one figured out early .
B000YHG72E|4.0|An excellent family movie for all ages - you can't go wrong with Elf! My kids love it and I bought it for my mother as an Xmas gift!
B0072KZ0Z6|5.0|I found this at a great price and it's a great show...worth every penny!...i would have paid more but i'm glad i didn't have to!
B0020PJJHS|4.0|While Brosnan will not go down as they greatest Bond ever, this is a solid first outing.  Just enough gadgets and not quite as campy as late Roger Moore films.  Definitely worth watching...
B009SQRL4U|5.0|This movie is so funny, sweet and even my older boys, 10 and 12, loved it because of the military aspect!!!
B006ZAZ31U|5.0|Absolutely great. any time you think you cant get through something just take time to read Adam's story and it will make you realize you can do anything you set your mind to
B002HWRYJE|5.0|THIS MOVIE BRINGS BACK MEMORIES WHEN I JUST LOVED THAT SERIES OF STAR TREK WHEN IT WAS A WEEKLY SERIES ON TV. IT HELPED TO ESCAPE REALITY IN A WAY.
B002SS8S7E|4.0|A great begining story to what turned out to be a great series. Going to the point of how Bruce became Batman was the most intriguing story I have seen by DC in a long time.
B004A8ZWVK|5.0|THIS FILM WAS JUST WONDERFULLY PUT TOGETHER. I CAN DEFINITELY IDETIFY WITH THIS FILM. IT BEEN HARD ROAD TO OVERCOME BUT IT WAS WORTH IT.
B009VB97EY|5.0|really fun ....everyone in the theater loved it ....really fun..............what more can i say really had a good time liked the movie.......
1452101248|5.0|This is a gorgeous and inspiring cookbook featuring recipes from the Middle East.  The Pictures are visually enticing also and draw you into new cooking adventures.
B008Y2FRFO|5.0|this is the best game in the world I think everyone in the world should play it it is awsome
B002MQYOFW|5.0|This. Is not my usual type of book I read but I was reading it with my granddaughter and I just couldn't put it down. I can't wait until my granddaughter finishes it so we can talk about it. I'm already at the half point of ten second book and enjoying this one to
B009SQRL4U|4.0|this is a movie that is cute and funny.  will be adding this to our list of regular christmas movies.
B0085YNML2|5.0|Very challenging...... Love it!!!  My kids are better at these games than I am.  I am sure they will love it.
B001NHNG64|5.0|I like the action, Jacks thinking and his attitude. Most men would like to be as free as he is.
B00AMBLXP8|2.0|This is probably just my patircular taste but I only found a few snips to be funny. I only decided to watch the movie because I had heard some coworkers talk about how funny it was and I happen to love Mark W. However, as expected I didn't care for the movie.
B005LAIH4A|5.0|This is a movie my 8 year old and 4 year old both love to watch over and over. The message of the importance to respect our environment and care for it is also a great message for the kids. Dr. Seuss never fails to deliver great stories, and I'm glad to see them brought to the film world as well.
B005LAJ22Q|5.0|Love this show.<br />There's actual chemistry between the characters.<br />no matter how out of this world a situation may seem, the plot and the cast keep things rolling and involved. There is literally NEVER a dull moment.<br />I love that many of the plot twists and most gut turning moments depend on peoples short comings and personal vendettas.<br />Cast, shooting, plot, camera work, zombie make up are all super sweet
B009FZHYKU|5.0|Love Walking Dead! It keeps you on your toes because no character is safe from the zombies. Thank you for making it available for purchase! :)
B00A6PD9I4|4.0|My husband and I rented Brave via Amazon instant video (which was awesome!) and we really enjoyed the movie but thought it was much too scary for our 5 and 3 year old boys. There was a lot of scary and intense bear parts, and people hunting bears. There was humor spread throughout, my husband and I laughed out loud quite a few times, but overall not very kid friendly. We will be waiting quite a while before watching it with our boys.
B008Y2FRFO|2.0|Saw this in my reviews and forgot I even had it. Without paying more money you can’t keep playing. You can only go so far and then you have to pay. Not that much fun.
B00992CF6W|4.0|It's very similar but there's no survival and there's no clouds. I would prefer it have at least an ocean at the edge of the world and animals.
B007EECSFA|2.0|I found this book to be very long and very boring.  I am usually a Kate Morton fan, but this one was not my cuo of tea!
B004SIMNF0|5.0|Bought this after another photographer mentioned having something similar to help as he did photograph sessions. I finally decided on the Spider Pro because it goes completely around the waist rather than clipping to the belt. It has been a LIFE SAVER and made photo sessions so much easier. Definitely worth the money.
B008LV8TSU|5.0|I first picked up Howls Moving Castle in my teen years and have loved it since. The story of Sophie, a mad hatter, and Howl, a temperamental wizard never gets old. In fact, each time I read it, something reveals its self in the story that I hadnt noticed before. Ms Wynne Jones is a master story teller.
B009FZHYKU|5.0|Simply the best show on tv ever!!!!! Can't wait for the rest of season three it's gonna be epic!!!! Go rick!!!
B0019IIPZO|5.0|For an old flick, it spurs the imagination and has much excitement and curiosity. A great addition is the trilogy for the video library.
B0076DELIG|4.0|A bit predictable but I liked it.  One of his not so good . Look forward to the next one
B00AE2LJVS|3.0|All the elements of a good film are scattered in there, but they just don't come together very well. The movie ends up a bit disconnected and rather anti-climactic.
B005IQ39AY|3.0|The game is okay. I have enjoyed playing it, but it doesn't really take a lot of skill to play it.
B0052RDHTM|5.0|Learned so much about this time period while enjoying the characters and story line. Some of the situations where different characters meet is a little too coincidental, but not impossible to believe and makes for an interesting story line. Looking forward to next book in series.
B000YABS8E|5.0|I love this movie.  It's been one of my favorites and when we got rid of our VCR I had to find it on DVD to add to my collection.
B0096DZKZC|5.0|I love any kind of sonic game myself and the kids do too.  It is a great game for a pretty good price.
B00A7ZWUJC|1.0|I'm a pretty casual fan of Rihanna's. I usually end up liking only a handful of songs from her albums. Every year it seems, especially the last 3-4, she has to release her obligatory annual album. \\"Good Girl Gone Bad\\" was as close to a masterpiece that Rihanna has ever come, \\"Rated R\\" Capitalized on her \\"then-split\\" from Chris Brown, and \\"Loud\\" would be a close second as my fav Riri disc. Lots of fun, upbeat and not nearly as depressing as a lot of her content has become as of recent.<br /><br />\\"Talk That Talk\\" was fairly decent, mostly cohesive. I count 9 songs off the deluxe edition in my ipod to date. But I found that as much as I enjoy \\"We Found Love\\", this album gave me the feeling that it was rushed and hurried into production to be there on time for x-mas sales and black friday. As much as I got that mediocre feeling with \\"Talk That Talk\\", I am feeling it even more now with \\"Unapologetic\\".<br /><br />\\"Diamonds\\" was a terrible lead single. I hate the way that Rihanna is trying to do vocal aerobics like she is Beyonce or something on this track. Light hearted fare like \\"What's my Name\\" is far better suited to Rihanna, as opposed to trying to come off as an accomplished student of voice. Not buying it. The music dosen't rope me in and the lyrics are quite remedial. It reeked of desperation from the moment I heard it.<br /><br />Overall the album doesn't feel like a cohesive work. It sounds more to me like a mix of studio leftovers from previous recording sessions and tracks recorded in haste, to get this crap out the public ASAP! \\"Phresh Off The Runway\\" has a fun track, but I can barely even understand what she is saying under the autotune nightmare that is her vocals. \\"Numb\\" is one of the songs that is listenable for me, but I sometimes cringe when I arrive at Eminem's wasted guest appearance. I wasn't feeling \\"Loveeee Song\\" or \\"Pour it up\\", nothing really keeping me engaged in the music, vocals are forgettable. I did enjoy \\"What Now\\" in spite of the cliched backing ballad track. Sounds like Beyonce's \\"Hello\\" to me. But I still enjoy it.<br /><br />\\"Nobody's Business\\" is pathetic. Im tired of all the attention Riri and Chris Brown get for their dysfunction. I dont care about your love life. I care about the music. needless to say, they clearly do not. It's a forgettable track about two stars so self-involved that they have to write dumb crap like this just to get attention. \\"Get It Over With\\" is a song that I can listen to without qualms. I like the dreamy, light and calm production of the song. Almost makes her seem human for a brief moment. \\"Love Without Tragedy/Mother Mary\\" is a mixed bag for me. I listen to the song until it gets to the \\"Mother Mary\\" part. It kinda gets bland for me once the song hits that point.<br /><br />Most of what else is here is barely worth mentioning. Ballads like \\"Stay\\" have never been Rihanna's strong suit, and there isn't anything special or mind popping about the song at all.  \\"No Love Allowed\\" is just some more generic reggae styled crap that is also becoming a headache for me. Ever since \\"Man Down\\" she thinks that every time she does this itll be a hit. Its a hard disc to get through folks. Thank my lucky stars it was free.<br /><br />Rihanna seems to be taking her superstardom for granted at this point. Her last 4 albums have been mostly hit or miss for me. Whats awesome is absolutely great, but when she is bad, she really sucks. This album completly exposes itself for what it really is: A half-assed, mediocre attempt at capitalising on tabloid controversies and attempt to get street credit by saying the F-word a LOT and a bunch of flimsy  single sexual entendres.<br /><br />There is nothing groundbreaking here. No new territory to be explored. Its more of the same stale formula that Rihanna has worn out on her last 1,000 albums. Some of the songs don't even sound finished, and that was kinda of an issue I had with \\"Talk That Talk\\". Rushed. Half-baked. Unengaging and uninspiried. I honestly at this point want to know what lyrics that the \\"team\\" or Rihanna herself have written that your average fifth grader cannot....<br /><br />It's really not worth buying, and if you do have to listen, I hope your ears don't bleed. Not much else to say....barf! is Rihanna even believeing what she is selling at this point? Some of it is good, but overall, the big picture just sees the crap to good ratio on her discs working more in favor of crap. Dont Download it and don't buy the coaster. The person who gifted this to me meant well, but I can't take anymore of Rihanna. Its really just all hype. Remind me again why people actually spend money on this?
159413586X|5.0|This is one of the best series I have ever read and was so sad to learn that this is definitely the end of the series.  It is well written and easy to read.  I couldn't put it down and I am going to reread just to see if I catch on to anything now that I have read all three books.
B002UBRFDC|5.0|I read this book on recommendation.  I was enthralled form the start.  The protagonists, the writing style, and the rich (though Americanized) depiction of Japanese culture was enough to vault this book into my top 5 before I had even finished half of it.  Through and through a great story, and according to a PBS documentary on Samurai Japan, incredibly accurate from a historical standpoint.
B0086700CM|5.0|Easy to learn loads and plays well, good game to play with the kids and to compete for a high score!
B0081L391C|5.0|This movie kept me laughing all the way through, waiting on a part 2 now. this mivie was actaully better then the original tv series.
B004SJ3BCI|5.0|The kids always love to play this game and I usually don't run into many problems with it.  Loads and plays well, would definitely recommend.
B009FZHYKU|3.0|this show is seriously in need of some excitement, at the rate its going I;m going to root for the walkers to bite everyone. BORING!
B004SIIBGU|4.0|Easy to use on all our devices. Nice clean user interface. Looks great on the Kindle. Pretty straight forward app
B000OZ0NXA|4.0|This book is the first in a series starring Jack Teacher.  It is written in short declarative sentences. Just like this review is written.  Some people have complained about this, but I feel that this style fits the personality of Reacher.<br />For readers who love action and a pretty good mystery this book would be right up their alley.  Child keeps you turning the pages and wanting more. He's created an American James Bond, albeit one who is much more rough around the edges.<br />In some ways he's a Bond mixed with a modern day Mike Hammer.<br /><br />There are a couple of
B007VUA7VO|5.0|Absolutely one of the best battery apps there is. Very user friendly and more info available than most other battery apps you have to pay for
1932735410|5.0|I took a week long PMP boot camp and was utterly lost trying to swim through all the information at the fast pace it was being hurled at me. I tried reading the PMBOK and found it so dry and unorganized that I never actually made it through the entire book. This exam prep book was put into language that made all the concepts easy to understand and I credit it for my passing of the PMP. Highly recommend!
B0097NGUJG|5.0|This is a fantastic album that has the the complex vocal tones and rhythms that remind me of Radiohead but it is distinctly different.  It may not be groundbreaking, but it's complex and catchy and solid album that's worth a listen.<br />--Update--<br />I bought this album months ago and it's just grown on me.  Breezeblocks, for example is just a fantastic track (even though the video is a bit creepy).
B0076DELIG|4.0|Not one of the better Bosch books but interesting.  It seems as Harry gets older he's not as &#34;inspiring&#34; as he used to be.
B00AMBLXP8|4.0|This is a excellent comedy and directorial debut from Seth Macfarlane.  It takes a 'realistic' look at an imaginary teddy-bear that comes to life.  The film is a lot fun with a decent plot and great acting (Mark Wahlberg and Mila Kunis) and voice over work (Seth Macfarlane).<br /><br />If you are looking for fun, well made comedy, this is highly recommended.
B009WO7NQO|4.0|Interesting and fun.  The music and sounds are very much like the original movies.  It can be difficult at times.
B009RI4FRU|5.0|This is one of Wes Anderson's best in my opinion.  It's charming, hilarious, and absurd.  It captures all of those awkward social moments in life without being too serious in a way that only Anderson can do.<br /><br />It's perfectly acted, Bill Murray, Edward Norton, and Bruce Willis are all pros that never disappoint.<br /><br />The young protagonists are fantastic as well playing adolescents - not yet adults, but not entirely children dealing with adult feelings.<br /><br />It's amazing that such genuine human emotion and heart can be conveyed with such absurd and hilarious events.<br /><br />This is easily the best film I've seen all year.
B009IQG5M4|5.0|One of the most prestigious films from Disney's Touchstone Pictures division, \\"The Joy Luck Club\\" is a generation-spanning, no-holds-barred drama about the interlocking lives and fates of Asian women who meet each week to play Mah-Jongg.<br /><br />My mom used to do the Mah-Jongg nights in my youthful days, when we lived in Miami. We are neither Asian nor Jewish, but it would appear that the archetypical mother figure is very similar among cultures, including my mom's which is Italian. The gathering scene at the beginning of \\"Joy Luck Club,\\" especially with its cacaphony of loud, multiple conversations, reminded me very much of when my mother's relatives used to get together.<br /><br />My point is that there is much in \\"The Joy Luck Club\\" with which many of us can identify, regardless of gender or culture. People are people and life can be cruel as well as wonderful.<br /><br />Be warned -- the goings get very tough in some of the flashback sequence. One scene in particular will never quite leave my mind, or my wife's. I won't spoil it but it involves France Nuyen's character as a young wife and mother, pushed to the edge. (Parent's note: this is a film about a family, but definitely NOT a family film and is rated \\"R.\\") My ignorance of the other actors' work is my shortcoming, because these artists are clearly outstanding in their blend of intensity, strength and dimension.<br /><br />Ms. Nuyen is among the more familiar actors in the film, at least to my little world. She's been in countless films and TV shows, but I remember her best at the side of her husband, actor Robert Culp, on numerous talk shows. Ming Na Wen, the speaking voice of Mulan, plays the central young character. Christopher Rich (\\"Murphy Brown,\\" \\"The Charmings,\\" \\"Reba\\") appears as a well-meaning but occasionally -- and painfully -- oafish suitor.<br /><br />The photography is brilliant and looks marvelous in Blu-ray. The disc could have used some bonus features, though, especially an Audio Commentary. I'm sure budgetary issues are forcing bonus features to the sidelines, but lots of us out here love them, sometimes as much -- and sometimes better than -- the movies.tary.

B008FPOIT6|5.0|I enjoyed Mr. Penumbra&#34;s 24-Hour Bookstore so much that  I read it twice!!! and recommended it to my bookreading granddaughter!

B007HACDLK|5.0|best book ive read in awhile. makes you think if this is really whats going on in that part of the world
B004U52VPS|5.0|iT IS AN EXCELLENT PRODUCT.<br />LOOKS LIKE THAT IN THE WEB PAGE.<br />I LOVE ANGRY BIRDS PRODUCTS.<br />PERFECT THE GAME FOR MY BOY
B00AE2LJVS|2.0|kinda boring to be honest. I felt that it was slow and wasn't a very enjoyable movie to watch. I love the cast but they just didn't do it for me in this movie.
B008HT4FUW|5.0|This is for Blu Ray version review. Since we ALL agree the show itself is a fantastic one so I added my approval along with thousands of supporters of this great show. Still, when I first watched Downton Abbie on regular TV broadcast and the second time on Internet Network (Netf..x), I was frustrated with the picture quality and truly wished the audio & video effects could be better. Then I BOUGHT THE BLU-RAY. WOW..the High Quality of visual & sound from this blu-ray set makes every dollar worth of collecting it. Buy the Blu-Ray and enjoy the show again & again with ultimate Superior picture and sound quality. EXCELLENT blu-ray.
030726999X|5.0|This is the #rd book in series and wasnt as good as first 3 but still really good. Hope she comes out with another one.
B008FSCNTK|3.0|I'm listening to Diana's latest as I type.  Normally, in trying to evaluate the merits of an album I find the critical comments to be more valuable than the usual \\"fanboy\\" adulation.  In this case - maybe because Ms Krall has confounded our expectations - I find much of the criticism to be overblown.  Yes, the rhythm can be plodding at times.  Yes, there are guitar and banjo - but they don't overwhelm her vocals.  And, perhaps in keeping with the cathouse theme, the breathiness of her voice is emphasized.  Overall, it's not an entirely successful experiment.  But I applaud Ms Krall's willingness to experiment and to move outside the Great American Songbook.  3 1/2 stars.
B000NGTJTY|3.0|Movie has a good story line, and good actors.  But, to gory and too much foul language for my taste.
B009C7JS14|3.0|It would be nice to have the future forecast available. I do like the layout, it has a very clear picture
B003YL4LYI|4.0|I read reviews that this one was boring, but I am fully entertained thus far and only 50% of the way through!
B008JFUUQ2|5.0|Rebel Wilson was Too Funny! Loved the Bella's I didn't know Anna Kendrick could Sing till this movie came out. IMHO I thought She was GREAT in this movie! all the Girls in the Bella's were Awesome!! I Enjoyed it Very Much!! Love the Blu-ray format also!! never watched a movie on blu-ray before. Excellent picture quailty and the audio was Awesome too!!
B002I9Z8I0|5.0|I got this for my dad and he was estactic! He has always love Star Trek and I found all 6 movies for a great price!
0811876373|5.0|Very adorable cook book for cake pops.  My favorite is the movie popcorn cake pop.  Many other cute ones but that is my fav.  You can find this great book at Cost Plus World Market and other retailers if you would like to see it before you buy it.  I definitely recommend this book if you would like to take your cake pops to the next level.
B000HKW7E0|5.0|I've seen this movie at least twice a year every year since it came out! It is a classic that will always get a laugh out of me each Christmas! If you haven't seen it do us all a favorite and rent it right now
B0013TXA5Y|5.0|As the first book it gets a little confusing at the beginning because your trying to get into a rythm. But once you get into it, you'll never want to stop reading.
B00A9C3RB8|2.0|Do not watch unless you can relate of course. I'm 28 and thought some parts were honest and real, but I think it would be great for the parents to watch to rekindle some old flames maybe
B001NLKZUA|5.0|This book was really good. I couldn't put it down. Everything is beautifully written so that it makes you feel as if your in the book. If your the type of person that loves mystery, romance, and supernatural things then this book is for you.
B008LY9AWG|5.0|No one better than Connelly. These are great stories! If you like short stories, you will love these. Read them now!
B001NLL93W|5.0|This book was really good. The tension that was created and the love between Jace and Clary is soo emotional. I couldn't put this book down.
B0076DELIG|5.0|And Connelly at his best, too. If you've been enjoying Connelly for the past 20 years, this will continue the love affair. If you're new to Harry Bosch, this is a great piece to start.
B003XF1XOQ|3.0|Moved slower than the first two but grabbed me at the end. I do hunger for more. Very enjoyable book.
B005QPMB2Y|5.0|works on some tablets and phones but not all. Could not get it to work on my Motorola android phone.
6305428042|5.0|I absolutely love this movie and was beyond thrilled when my 12 year old daughter requested it for Christmas!  Makes me relive my childhood every time I see it.  :)
B007BFSYMS|5.0|Great app with plenty of noise to drowned out those creaky noise that go boom in the night not much different then the lite version
B000W4HJ44|5.0|I can't offer a great review as I bought this for my daughter for Christmas.  I myself don't care for the movie, but she loves it!
B00A8ECU24|5.0|The best Pony Game on the Android store.  Free.  To beat the game requires some cash, but there are days of free play before one gets to that point.<br /><br />There are some minor bugs, but they don't hurt gameplay too much.  Also some new mini games would be nice.
B003WTE886|5.0|This cd is a Christmas gift for my 12 year old so I can't really offer a review.  But she requested this cd and LOVES to listen to music!
B0064X7FVE|2.0|most are about the same. crowded looking, and many times locks up and doesn't work without rebooting. this is no different
B009NQKPUW|3.0|This is an entertaining enough movie. If you liked the other Alien movies then you will enjoy this movie also.
B00A757EFW|3.0|For free this is a nice little game.  Probably will update to full game.  Wife will enjoy playing on long trip.
B001NIC0A6|5.0|I've always loved this movie. However, when my VCR bit the dust, I could not watch the movie any longer. It is action-packed all the way to the end and entangles a love story at the same time. How could you possibly go wrong with Pierce Brosnan and Linda Hamilton. But the movie has taken on new meaning for me because of a line in the movie by Grant Heslov who plays Greg. When Linda Hamilton's character drives up with the daily coffee, Grant says \\"Yes, it's coffee time. Coffee...coffee,coffee,coffee,coffee,coffee, Cappucino! Java! Yes\\". I have a new cat named \\"Coffee\\" and when I call her all I have to do is say, \\"Coffee...coffee,coffee,coffee,coffee,coffee\\" and she comes running.
B006LSZECO|3.0|Didn't really keep my interest. Found I had to force myself to continue. Its well-written, just not that interesting. I had already figured it out 25 percent thru.
B000PC0S5K|5.0|More spiritual insights. If you are ready for higher intelligence here you go. More spiritual food to help you along your journey.
B0027MJU00|5.0|Loved every page.  Gillian has perfected the art of clever, wonderful writing.  Will keep you wanting more.  Count on several sleepless nights.
B007J4T2G8|2.0|Well written, the erotic parts are very good, the rest is very boooring. It is a romance novel, good only for domination ideas.....
B00A7Z8KAU|5.0|I have sketchbook mobile...love the app, but Pro is so much better. Navigation, paint brushes and interface is so much fluid when trying to get things done....this apps is a professional/ beginners artistic dream....Come on autodesk make 3d max into an app for kindle fire hd.
B009YP9L7U|5.0|Easy read, cute story finished it in a day, I needed to know what was gonna happen next. Recommend for a nice getaway from reality!
B00447L4JG|5.0|I LOVED THE MOVIE. I SANG WITH THE SONGS. THE STORY IS FUNNY AS WELL AS TOUCHING.. YOU WILL LOVE THE MOVIE. IT HAS A GOOD STORY LINE. AS WELL AS MAKING YOU FEEL APART OF IT.
B009SJ3GUK|5.0|As a big fan of the first season, season 2 is more horrific and shocking. It is insane and I can't wait for each new episode!
B005LAIISA|5.0|WE LOVED THE OTHER MOVIES. AND THIS ONE IS NO DIFFERENT. IT WAS VERY FUNNY. IT ALSO HAD A GREAT STORY. IT KEPT US IN OUR SEATS. AND FOR A MOVIE TO DO THAT TO MY HUSBAND IS HARD TO DO. IF YOU LOVED THE OTHER ICE AGES. YOU WILL LOVE THIS ONE ALSO.
B006TTC54A|5.0|My husband and I have watched this so many times and have never gotten tired of it.  This is definitely one of our favorite comedies of all time, and can you imagine.......there was no vulgarity in it.  How could that possibly be?!?!?!  We love it!
B00AMBK6J2|5.0|if you love family guy you will love this. Has all the actors/voices from family guy but in a live action movie. I was laughing pretty much the entire movie.
B000YHG72E|4.0|This is one of those silly movies that you just have to get a good laugh at.  Have watched it several times. Love it!
B009HELT3C|5.0|I think this is the best of the three! I suppose it may be that it ties them all together but still, my favorite of the three.
B002LMV7TS|4.0|This was a good movie.  Looks like it might be a little scary for kids but our 6 year old granddaughter loves it.  We have watched it several times and have enjoyed it.
B007IXWKUK|5.0|I love these books. I cant put them down<br />I am way too interested in them. I hope more are written
0375851569|5.0|This is a great gift for kids starting to read by their own<br />The price is low<br />The books are fun and educational<br />Can't wait to order number 2!
B007IXWL2C|5.0|I love these books. I love the Characters.<br />I love the story I hope they write more of this<br />couple i want to see how they life together progresses.<br />I wanna see Ana and Christan Have a baby!
B0070Y46UY|5.0|th book is great so far, even though i have not finished i already have a favorite part. it is the carnivorus island and where pi uses the wildlife to experiment woth the algae. my next favorite part is when pi think that Richard Parker is taking to him instead of a frech man. i recommend this book to anyone who will listen. to all of you that use this review, trust me it is an instant classic
B008JGSM6G|5.0|Great game. Higher levels are challenging. Wish I had not blown my free hints at lower levels as I was learning the game.
B005IQZB14|3.0|In The Wild the author was not particularly likable.  I liked the beginning of the book more than the hike itself.  There were too many details of the places she hiked and traveled.
B009ZE27US|1.0|this app ducks it rodent even give. ur real age don't bother. ur time to get this app its busts waste of tor f****** time
B000FC2L1Y|5.0|I didn't think I'd be so enthralled with this series, but I am. Great blend of fiction, fantasy and time travel.
141694737X|4.0|I don't know why I assumed this was a full size book but it isn't.  It's a very tiny little book but it will work for the price.
B004P1JEWU|5.0|Anyone who likes fantasy will love these books. Haven't been able to put the series down in the last two months. It's a mix of lord of the rings, Harry potter and 50 shades of grey
B000V39KDO|5.0|well done. gripping. entertaining. liked the female role models (although not for young kids!). It is almost like watching a cartoon story it is so overdone, but done well.
B000002UAI|5.0|The Beatles, worlds ahead of us even today.  We still don't know why or what got them together, all we know is that there's Beethoven, Mozart, and The Beatles.  &#34;Beatles For Sale&#34; was released for Christmas in 1964 and was one of the first Beatles albums I listened to.  This isn't &#34;Abbey Road&#34; or &#34;The White Album&#34;, so it's not revolutionary, but if you compare this to other albums that were out in 1964.....exactly.
B009JBZH54|5.0|All the newer Batman movies at a very reasonable price.  I was just going to buy the last movie of this trilogy, but saw this option at a comparable price to the latest Blu Ray Batman movie, and found this to be the better value.  Although, IMO, I believe the third and last movie isn't quite as good as the second movie.  We almost forgot how good the first movie, was so we watched it again.  Just a nice collection to have at a reasonable price which we recommend to others.
B000N3SSBM|5.0|This film is proof that it's not about the cast, but about the challenges they present themselves and completely and solve them before your very eyes.  Some say Ace Ventura and Dumb and Dumber are his best films, but I disagree.
0470449756|4.0|This is great for anyone wishing to practice their Verbal knowledge of the GMAT. It also gives a general summary of the types of questions you can expect from each section. The Reading Comprehension section gives you Main Idea, Inference, etc. along with a few Strategies which are really helpful if you aren't planning on buying any of the other study guides. I loved this thing, but it does have 1 down side... a ton of problem, but most of them are on the easier side, so if you are looking to challenge yourself on Verbal, this is not the place.
B008673ZAQ|4.0|Most people compare this to Fifty Shades, I say it doesn't even come close.  It's a good story, and I will definitely purchase book 3 when it comes out, but it's no Fifty Shades.
B00AIQP9DE|5.0|fun game. one of the better g5 games at a good price of $2.99. keep them coming g5. I wish they were longer tho.
B00846REIS|4.0|This is a good book, although I am more partial to the Fifty Shades trilogy.  A good book, and I did continue to the second book....of course the third when it comes out.  But it seems their relationship is a little more &#34;troubled&#34; rather than meant to be.
B009ZXT4BY|4.0|it was a great game I would so buy it bit the sounds where scary as **** I was so scared and wood takes a long time to get but it is a great style and the crafting should be implimented into minecraft pe just like that
B006LSZECO|3.0|I read this book, and thought it was a great story up until the end.  I'm sorry to say that I did NOT like the ending at ALL.  I'm not a person who always has to have a happy ending, but the wife in this book?  She definitely deserved to get hers in the end.  Not continue to make everyone's life miserable for the rest of time.  :(
B004FP1WX0|5.0|I thought this movie was great! I could really relate so I felt involved in the movie the entire time. Since the t.v show premered, I've been very eager to see the movie.
B000N2HBSO|5.0|This is a very interesting and well written book.  You will not want to put it down once you start!
B00AE2J93I|1.0|I fell asleep watching this.  It just didn't grab my attention at all.  The characters lacked inspiration and didn't seem to have a uniqueness that could be attributed to them...seemed like a run-of-the-mill animation.
0525953728|3.0|No Easy Day is 1/2 an account of \\"Mark Owens'\\" life as a SEAL, 1/3 planning for the UBL mission, and the balance is the mission, itself.  With all the hoo haw made about Mr Owens' not getting military vetting/approval for the book, I expected something I hadn't heard or read in the press.  Mr Owens makes the claim that he wrote the book to \\"set the record straight,\\" but as far as I could tell, there was nothing to set straight.  Sure, the initial reports said UBL engaged the SEAL team alongside assorted other to-be-expected incidents of erroneous reporting, but those were corrected in short order after the raid.<br /><br />I thought it was suspicious at the time that this was being rushed to print while JAG was breathing down this book's neck.  Was Mr Owens looking to boost Obama's re-election chances?  (No).  Was the publisher taking a calculated risk in cashing in on this first-hand account while the election brought focus to this story? (Undoubtedly yes).  Was this a \\"kneecapping\\" by a disgruntled ex-SEAL as suggested by veterans in several of the 1-star reviews?  (I have no basis for an opinion).  What I do know is this book, while interesting enough, offers little to regular readers of any major newspaper in terms of what happened in the UBL mission.  The reader gets vignettes of other SEAL activity that never saw the light of day in the press, but these are all pretty antiseptic.<br /><br />The row over potentially leaked secrets is, in hindsight, laughable.  I attended an event for entrepreneurs where a former high-ranking Navy SEAL gave a lecture circuit talk - the theme being the perseverance and dedication required to get a brand new business off the ground are (loosely speaking) similar to what it takes to become a SEAL (and here's how our boys do it).  The talk and accompanying film probably gave more insight to the makings of a SEAL than No Easy Day does, without the operational/mission-related anecdotes.<br /><br />At the end of the day, Mr Owens' bookand the noise surrounding his breach of protocol was, in my opinion, much ado about nothing.  Mr Owens says in the introduction that if you're looking for secrets, you're holding the wrong book.  In this he is absolutely correct.  If you read the newspaper, you know most of what this book says already.<br /><br />No Easy Day is important in the fact it is a first-hand account of a historically significant military operation, and it has it's share of thrill.  It is, however, unlikely to blow you away.  Pun intended.
B00AMBK6J2|5.0|I expected this to be somewhat stupid but was delighted at the humor and life situations in the movie.  This is definitely a keeper.
B007HACDLK|5.0|Flynn writes with the kind of description and phraesing that gives the confidence he is an expert. &#34;The Last Man&#34; gives you the feeling he is sharing a very private personal experience, bathed in adventure and believable intrige, can't wait for the next new publication, have read and enjoyed all of his previous books,as well.
B009HELT3C|4.0|I think I liked this one the best. Really good story and Josh Brolin does a supurb job channeling Tommy Lee Jones as Agent K. Would definitely recommend this one.
B000SEGEKI|5.0|Two thumbs up! Must have for all developers, programmers, architects and consultants. This book make you more productive, smarter and better developer.
0891419063|5.0|Truly the best book ive ever read.  Not only did the author have a facinating story to tell, but he did it so well in a very candid and truthful manner.  Still hunting for one this good.
B002ZG999U|5.0|I recommend seeing this movie..It was action packed and very entertaining.The dvd was in great condition. I can't wait to see II
B00867GHS8|5.0|Thank You Dinsey/Pixar for listening to me!!!!!!!!!! I have been wanting Nemo on Bluray since forever. It never gets old. Dori is my favorite! Now I have the digital copy so I can download it to my phone and watch it whenever. Im a kid at heart.
B0058YPGSY|5.0|Got the dvd and instantly watch this season. I had all the other seasons already.Really good series and dvd was great quality
B004JZBGWI|4.0|Nice to be able to write down what comes to ones mind and not have to remember - especially at my age.
B009WO7NQO|3.0|Poor design, poor engineering and even worst implementation. Do not enjoy playing &#34;Star Wars&#34; as it is totally not fun<br />at any of the levels.
B009B0L324|5.0|;I was very impressed with the production and playing of the music!! Any fan of this group would cherish these collections forever!!
B00AMBLXP8|4.0|Really a funny story and well done.  It was exactly what I expected from Family Guy creator Seth macfarlane.  If your looking for an academy award nominee, Ted probably isn't your pick.  If you want a laugh out loud raunchy non-pc movie, Ted should be right up your alley.
1476712042|5.0|This is the first book I have read by Jamie McGuire and I look forward to reading &#34;Walking Disaster&#34; when it comes out.  This was such a sweet love story.  After I was done reading the book,  I went back and read certain parts over again.  Just a really sweet story.
030758836X|4.0|Leaves you wonder where it is going, the writing style is unique, the characters intriging.  It is a possible reread
B001NHN7TU|5.0|Always get my stuff ahead of schedule. Love this movie. It is full if cheese but a great popcorn horror flick.
B0086449YA|5.0|Yes I was one of the lucky people to see Mark in concert. He opened for Bob Dylan and man was he great....
B000VMFDW2|5.0|I am a huge WWII history buff and have read many accounts of a soldiers experience during this war.  So far, this has been the best one I have read.  The reader feels like they are actually there in the foxhole with Sledge.  Not for the faint of heart!  Great read!
B0076DELIG|3.0|Halfway through the book, you knew where it was headed and, sure enough, that is where it took you.<br />Would have liked more flashbacks into what the journalist was like or felt.  Need more depth to characters other than the<br />protagonist.
B009SJ3H8Q|5.0|Nothing good ever happens. The show is very hard to put down even with all the crazy things happening. Watch it!
B008P1EWIM|1.0|Love the looks,but the closest readings are too far away to do me any good. Useless to me. Weather channel...not as pretty, but practical. Had I known I would not have bought it.
B0001US62I|1.0|I would put this unpleasant little film in the `horror' category. The plot, such as it is, is about private eye Harry Angel's attempts to track down a has-been singer by the name of Johnny Favourite, supposedly for a solicitor, Herman Winesap (Dann Florek) and his client Louis Cyphre (Robert DeNiro). In fact, Cyphe is really Lucifer in disguise and the whole film is simply a showcase for New Orleans-based voodoo with thoroughly gruesome effects. The lovely Charlotte Rampling has a brief part as fortune teller Margaret Crusemark before she too is butchered. Angel (Mickey Rourke) has a brief fling with another sorceress Epiphany Proudfoot (Lisa Bonet) before she too ends up in a bloodbath. This film is totally missable.
B005WUHAX8|5.0|Purchased it used and it looked like new. I have used it and absolutely issues, my daughter even accidentally dropped it and it protected it. Highly recommend this product.
B009SQRL4U|4.0|This was a very cute Christmas movie and the whole family liked it. The adventure with the grandpa and Arthur made the kids laugh.
B0000VCZKM|5.0|It was packaged really well and shipped promptly. I had it before it said that I would have it. Of course I love this movie. Oldie but goodie.
B00917IQFY|2.0|Well I guess they had their hay day and this isn't it. Get Howlin' Wind, Heat Treatment or one of the early albums if you don't have them. This is pretty disappointing. The political Graham Parker isn't very interesting although the Rumour seem capable still. Not totally horrible, just unnecessary.
B008YWY0HK|5.0|I loved this movie! It's my new disney favorite! Woohoo!<br /><br />It was the lion king before! It took a while!
B000T433CO|1.0|No romantic comedy has any reason being 2.5 hours long. It was pure torture. There was so much stuff that could have been left out--esp. the entire subplot with Eli Wallach. When a girl wants to watch a chick flick, she doesn't think \\"Oh, I hope she finds a fulfilling friendship with the old man next door!\\" So many plot holes you could drive a truck through them. I like a good romance, but this wasn't it. If you like Jane Austin and the Brontes, STAY AWAY.
B005HSG3TC|1.0|I purchased in error, it was very nice, but I wanted something with a cover and this was jus a shell, didnot dislike, but not really what i wanted so I returned and purchased another
0321885112|5.0|First off, this book is a pleasure to read. I sat down and read the entire book in one go...in only a couple of hours. Second, the book is motivating. Mike removed the fear of being a horrible drawer, so I started right away not being concerned with the artist quality. The third aspect that makes the book so brilliant is that Mike shares a ton of techniques and examples...the entire book is sketchnotes after all! The outcome is that I have been actively sketchnoting and surprisingly am not nearly as horrible at it as I thought. Thanks Mike!
B00AMBH70S|5.0|Once the movie actually begins, you will not want to move from your seat. Could not answer the door or phone, as you cannot be distracted for even a moment. A great film all the way around.
B0098VYKSA|5.0|I was very surprised that I like this move but actually I really loved it.  Full of action and it did keep my interest.
B004USLWVE|4.0|While it is full loaded, it becomes too heavy to be used as a sling bag.it is just a good container, not a good bag.
B00A7CF1QY|5.0|I've watched the previous Bourne movies and this was kept my interest all through the movie.  I would definitely recommend this movie to my friends,  In fact, I already have!
B003O86FMW|5.0|I loved this one as much as the first, hard to put it down!<br />Starting book three now, can't wait!
B00867GHS8|5.0|This movie was great in Blu-ray.  I loved it the first time in regular digital and absolutely loved it in blu-ray.  I've wated this movie several times my self.  Definitely recommend this movie in Blu-ray.  Loved it!!!
B000GOUMPI|4.0|The movie itself is great. However, the digital formatting of movies does have a ways to go. There were times where this movie seemed a bit pixilated and two dimensional. The convenience of the product is great (able to buy and download instantly) but look forward to the technology improving.
B009VB998I|5.0|A perfect movie for children and even for their parents.  It left me with a wonderful feeling of well-being and I've watched it several times.  I would recommend this movie.
B009O07NDY|4.0|You can't go wrong with Howard Shore's beautiful music. It reprises familiar strains of  soundtracks past, but also introduces us to new themes and instruments. The packaging of the album was beautiful. However, the cheap little staples holding the album booklet popped right off (was it supposed to come off??) and tore up the bookelet. A picky detail, but if I'm paying for a special edition, I expect these details to be thought of.
B009CPN2G8|4.0|This was a cute movie and a great family film.  I definitely would recommend this movie to anyone with children.
B0083SBJXS|5.0|I saw this in the theatre and knew that I just had to own it.  For all us ladies out there, we can't pass up Robert Downey Jr as Ironman!  The whole cast is fantastic and the movie is a blast to watch.  I have watched it at home a few more times already and keep catching little things that I missed in the theatre.  A totally action-packed, witty film.  If you haven't seen the movie, it is a must see for action/comic book enthusiasts!
B0080CL0HM|5.0|An amazing movie accurately portraying the times of Maupassant and 1890's Paris,<br />The decor and sets are outstanding.<br />Robert Pattinson delivers an amazing performance,<br />Only warning, make sure to brush up on your French history: the power of the press, colonization in Africa, French 3rd Republic<br /><br />Enjoy, it really is an amazing movie !
B0094BB4TW|2.0|After the first five or six posts on the news feed, pictures and formatting stop.  It is makes it very difficult to read and keep up with what is being talked about.
B000SZK41M|5.0|Best of the series. classic Bruce Willis. Funny, action packed. Great holiday flick with some classic lines. Would recommend to all!
B000FCKC4C|5.0|This book will help you realize that dreams have just one purpose...to be achieved. Written in a fantasy style, it will motivate you to pursue your dreams no matter how difficult they might seem.
B009FHRRAA|5.0|so this was a required buy. The mostly unknown tracks on their demo (Disc 2) are awesome. It makes me wonder why they included \\"Settle for Nothing\\" on their studio album, when \\"Mindset's a Threat\\" and \\"Clear the Lane\\" are much better tracks.
B009FZHYKU|5.0|I haven't been this addicted to a new series since Lost. Waiting until February for the 2nd half of season 3 is going to be tough.
B0032CVAQQ|5.0|Great book recommend all to read! Have suggested all my friends to read this book for children, roommates and marriages.
B005PR44XC|5.0|Michael Lewis has found his rightful occupation. It is not Wall Street trader but writer and a fine writer he is.<br />I have read all his books and have found them all to be insightful and humorous to boot.
B001VWBFTG|5.0|coldplay viva la vida it a good album with a great collection of music it is awesome the combination of sounds
B006964E8S|1.0|Baldacci use to write readable books earlier in his career but his latest stuff is embarrassing. Boys own adventure with superhero thrown in for good measure.<br />I don't read Lee child but I imagine this is the model he is following.<br />Don't waste your money or time on this dross.
B000H5TVJY|5.0|received on time best of psycho movies i have seen in a long time would recommend others to see.christtian bale was execellent in the role he played as well.
0375507256|5.0|I went back and forth about buying this as I knew the Wachkowsi duo was adapting this for film and I didn't wan't to be all, eh, the book was better or worse, this is NOTHING like the book. Started this reading at the library while on break and two days later had my own copy in my hands to savor each page. Seriously, David Mitchell is a genius. I loved every page! Still haven't seen the movie but have re-read this book three times. Worth the time and the money.
B009WO7NQO|5.0|My kids love it very much! It is so awesome game. I played it once it's so fun to play!
B0007RT9LM|5.0|I love this movie...had on VHS but it got ruined in a move...so I m glad I was able 2 find it on DVD.....
B0000DJE9R|5.0|Great has all the loved songs on here the only one missing is man in the mirror but other than that<br /><br />The King!<br /><br />Shipped on time.
B004Y1USV2|5.0|This band has been on my top 20 since I first heard of them many many years ago.  I enjoy thier songs and musical aptitude.
B00AMBH70S|4.0|Keeps you engaged. Good action flick. Continues the &#34;legacy&#34; of &#34;edge of your seat&#34; involvement. Five mores words are required.
B00AMBK0X4|2.0|For months, I've heard how great 'Ted' was, and that it was a &#34;must watch.&#34; I finally caved and rented this, and indeed I had a few moments where I chuckled. However, it was far from the laugh out loud comedy I was expecting. I'm left with the distinct impression that this movie would be better under the influence of recreational pharmaceuticals.
B000JQV68A|4.0|I downloaded this because after reading the Great Gatsby I was a fan and I wanted to check out some of his other works.
B009JBWOU0|5.0|I've been looking to buy TDKR and Batman Begins, I own TDK only, so for the price you get all 3 plus a cool book and box, what's not to like? Can't beat the price really, great for any Batman fan!
B008HJGPVO|5.0|I've owned couple stylus for apple products, samsung, and now kindle.  out of all the stylus i've tried so far, this pen tops the chart.  It's very precise has a nice feel and thickness to it that doesn't tire out your hand.  I also really like the simple and sophisticated looking design.  I recommend to everyone!
B008XBCJ34|5.0|Loved this movie before I got it in 3D!<br />The home version is almost as great as the wide screen.
B00AMBLDEE|5.0|Renner was great - as good or better than Damon and the tie-in to the previous Bourne movies makes it work. Hopefully there will be another
B00AHSIQWE|3.0|The movie crashed three times so this review is biased because I was already aggravated.<br />I thought the movie had too many philosophic discourses that slowed down the action.<br />And Bale seemed outmatched as never before.<br />I'll give it another chance, but right now I feel the Dark Night should have stayed down.
B009FZFONO|5.0|Absolutely love the show. Each episode draws you in and leaves you wondering what's coming next. Great storyline, characters, and overall mood. The show is very graphic in nature at times, but other than that I would recommend it to anyone.
B007IXWL2C|5.0|I am completely addicted to these books, I have read them multiple times!  The story is great but the way these books are written are so good it sucks you into them and you can't seem to get enough.
B009ZZDNT6|5.0|I like that you can easily see which alarms are &#34;on&#34;. And I do like the musical sound of the alarm...most alarms are annoying, but the first sound I selected is perfect.
B007SGLZP8|5.0|Best book I've read in some time and I read a lot of books.  Make time for this one since you won't want to put it down.
B000022TSY|5.0|Grew up around motorcycles and riding(and I still ride ) so it brought back old memories of good times!<br />Excellent movie!!
B008AK8FHM|5.0|I truly enjoyed reading this book because it really revealed a side of life that I haven't really understood.  So for all of the skeptics out there I highly recommend this book to you!
B000SGRONM|1.0|This was a horrible selection for our book club. I didn't finish it & neither did most of the club. Very bleak & twisted.
B009RI4FRU|5.0|lovely movie, wonderful actors, a story for all ages.i can't  wait to watch it again with my daughter and grandsons!
B0076DELIG|5.0|Its always a great pleasure to read a solid story, well prepared and seemingly realistic... and Harry Bosch evolution in life.
B0090EKRKU|5.0|I think I enjoyed this movie as much as my daughters.  The humor was very cute.  Sure, it is a eco-message movie, but so what?  The kids enjoy it and what is wrong with having kids that recognize trees give us air to breathe?
0802130208|5.0|Great book!!  Takes a certain sense of humor to appreciate, very dry and witty.  Will have you rolling with laughter.  And this was written 40 yrs ago?  Gotta check this one out.
B007J4T2G8|5.0|I do not do much reading, but this book kept my attention all the way through. Couldn't put it down.
B004SDEP38|1.0|Free is only for reading. If you want to usethe app for new documents you have to buy full version.
B007FEFLTO|3.0|but still worth reading. classic case of the sophomore slump.... he somehow managed to make the first world war more exciting than the second. was just kind of slow throughout, and i felt like i had a much closer connection to the characters in the first book because he did a lot more to develop them. can't wait to see what the third book is like!
B009WUBERW|4.0|A lot a of action and that's good, but very predictable. Grew up on these action stars but there looking a little old. At least there are no super heros in it.
B009NQKPUW|2.0|This movie suck it was advertised as full of action it was not I had to sit though two hour of crap
B0076DCT2G|5.0|I have read all of DeMille's books.  This one was among the best.  I found myself laughing out loud at the clever reparte.  The plot was amazing with a number of surprising twists.  The characterization of each of the characters was especially good.  I highly recommend the book -- you will not be disappointed.
B003CSV7TK|5.0|This movie is a classic and is still one of the best Christmas shows we watch every year. We all love the Classics!
B007HACDLK|4.0|Being a big fan of the Mitch Rapp series, I enjoyed the book very much.  There were a number of surprises, most of which I didn't see coming.  I would have given it 5 stars, but the ending and resolution of issues was too quick.  Still, I highly recommend the book.
B008YI91HS|5.0|Here is a movies that you will want to watch over and over. It haves supense and action to keep you watching.
B007N5YIUS|5.0|Wonderful game. Lots of fun! My family and I love playing together. Would definately recommend to others. I love it!
B003JTHXOK|3.0|This is a standard Nicholas Sparks novel.  Very easy read, a little surprise at the end.  Something to read on a rainy cold day as it gives you a nice warm feeling.
B0011Z5IXC|4.0|Spotify doesn't have Led Zeppelin, so I thought I'd look into getting the 4 disc boxed set. Then I noticed that this has all the songs I really wanted for a fraction of the cost. It was well worth the $11.
B009HV2JT8|3.0|Entertaining, I gave it 3 stars. Is it a great movie?, no but it is decent. I would suggest to be at least 12 to watch it.
B0063IH60K|5.0|Simple & easy to play. I like it very much. I would recomend it.Excellent way to kill time waiting in doctors office.
B007SGLZP8|5.0|Great storyline. Although its fiction things like this happen in every state in many large cities. It's nice to see it in writing.
B00AGDVWDK|1.0|I would have given it no stars if I had that option.  The movie is an Asian language movie and I did not realize that when I purchased.  Don't know how to check the original ad to see if it was my mistake. I don't speak the language, so spent the money for nothing.
0345803485|1.0|OMG, I don't understand how this book is bestseller, this is a terrible book not to mention ridiculous. It's a complete waste of time and money, I should have listen to my dear friend who told me not to waste my money but no I wanted to see what all the fuss was about. Well, I can tell you this much-the fuss is full of crap and nonsense. If you want go-ahead waste of your time and money but take my word for it, you will regret every bit of it; so frustrating and extremely disappointed.
B0070Y46UY|5.0|I don't usually read &#34;best sellers&#34;, but this one had caught my eye years ago.  With the movie forthcoming and a recommendation from a co-worker, I decided to give it a try.  I was hooked by the first page, and lost a lot of sleep because I couldn't put it down.  The novel is captivating due to setting, it's look at religious philosophy, and it's adventurous nature.  In the end, I was stunned.  Well worth the read.
098555780X|5.0|Fansastic product and fast service.... Book was easy to understand and makes a great reference book for beginners as well as the professional
B0042UEU8M|4.0|Spoiler alert!<br />I thought this movie was about man who lost his brother, and gets psychologically unstable and have delusions.<br />Instead, it was about a man who sees ghosts. Even though that's a repeated idea, Zac Efron somehow manages to make it a good movie.
B000069AUI|5.0|Coldplay is one of my favorites.  I lost this CD awhile ago and was so happy you had it.  Thanks.
B009329Y30|5.0|There's not a single character in this movie that I would change.<br />All of the changes they made to the book was something that was needed.
B008FRFN7A|5.0|I had no way to print and needed a knitting pattern. But I had no computer. But I did have a Kindle Fire and a wireless printer. I searched the app store and found what I needed and within minutes had my pattern. The app installed easily and is so easy to use! Great product! And it was free!
B0011EU0NG|5.0|I remember watching this movie when I was growing up and then enjoyed sharing it with my kids. Now I get to share it with my grandkids. Love Dick Van Dyke in anything he has done.
B009ZAY8MM|5.0|Its only flaw is that there are only 6 songs. I could listen to this all day long, and they use their voices in the most artistic way I can imagine.
B00A1XOPE8|4.0|I thoroughly enjoyed The Emperor's Soul. I liked the story, especially the magic system that was implemented. This book inspired me to read other work by Mr. Sanderson.
B008P1EWIM|3.0|I have an AccuWeather in my Iphone that is better then this product but this does provide the required information in a reasonable format.
B006LSZECO|5.0|Excellent story....I couldn't put it down.  Very well written with lots of twists to the plot.<br />Would definitely recommend this book.
B008I43DYU|2.0|I would not recomend this product to anyone. If I could figure out how to remove the product from my Kindle I would.
B005COO1X6|5.0|Great short story in classic Stephen King style. If you are a fan you will enjoy this book! I did!!
B008XG1X18|5.0|I thought I was creative.... The people and ideas on this site are amazing. New twists for things I was doing everyday! A fresh change to a recipe that I have always made makes me a hero at my house. I'm addicted!
140131046X|5.0|A story of Renewal and Strengthening of Faith brought about by two different people in Mitch Albom's life, from two contrasting backgrounds.  For anyone who would like a true story of how Faith can build lives from different backgrounds, one of poverty and struggle, and one of education and opportunity. How this Faith effects and shapes the lives of those around them, including Mitch Albom.
B009G7ZYPY|5.0|I can listen it to all day long.  Susan Boyle has a turn of phrase that is different but lovely.  Would have loved a duet between her and Judy Garland on &#34;Somewhere Over the Rainbow!&#34;  She has a beautiful voice and expresses the music and emotions that is rare today.
B004R13U6Y|1.0|Disappointed because I downloaded this app to use fillable PDF and the app continues to force close before the one page before it fully loads.  If this can be fixed I would change review.
B007FEZQF8|5.0|I'm a big fan of the tv series on amc an desided to start reading the story. The book is amazing and I wish I had the money to get the next one in the series right now. I highly recommend reading this book if you like zombies.
B004ADH1RI|5.0|This has become a Halloween tradition for our family. Either we watch it while handing out the candy or the night we carve our pumpkin, usually a One-Eyed Willie jack-o-lantern.
B008HK3XKO|5.0|This is a very nice case. Good quality, good feel, does a good job for propping it up for watching video. The strap not only keeps it closed when you need it but you can wrap it around your hand for getting a better grip. The thing I love the most is how my Fire goes to sleep and wakes up when the cover is opened/closed. Brilliant! Awesome case.
B008Y2FRFO|4.0|I like it, visit the game most days, but not enough to spend money to get coins.  Trying to get those trinkits off the end is addicting.
B0000508U6|5.0|I Love it, the cd came to Perú in excellent conditions and its a perfect present for christmas for my sister because she loves Coldplay.
B0064TVQ5E|4.0|While the tiles are a little small for me I love the background music it is so relaxing.  I play this when I need quiet time.
B0056BMK6K|5.0|this book is very informative and fun, it will definitely help your ebook marketing, and i love that this guy has a great sense of humor
B007THA4FI|3.0|I am having a hard time with this book.  I keep trying but I don't get it.  The jacket mentions that there is pre-history with this story, maybe it should be a pre-requisite.
B0047WJ12K|1.0|Juvenile for an idiotic plot premise.  Juvenile for wooden acting.  Juvenile for loud booming noises.  Juvenile for lots of things blowing up and falling down.  Juvenile for lots of flames.  No wonder juveniles love it...
B007XKEY6Q|5.0|My whole family is into this game.  We interact everynight drawing for each other.  I laugh often watching others express themselves.  Love it - thank you!
B006L0A5P8|4.0|I have used 1Password for a long time and think highly of it. Many sites don't conform to its fill in option. It is easy to use and one of the better password products available. Also, they update a lot and keep things current.
B00AMBK0X4|1.0|Just not really that funny...Sorry Seth - I know you may have talent somewhere, it just didn't shine for me in this movie.
B007SGLZP8|4.0|I haven't read Grisham in awhile. This was worth coming back. It is an interesting plot with some nice characters.
B009VB97EY|2.0|Kind of a stupid movie, I love the actors but this work is not their best.  I would not recommend this movie.
B007HACDLK|5.0|Vince Flynn can really deliver!  I can't get enough of Mitch Rapp and I hope Vince gives us more of him!
B0063IH60K|5.0|For those of us who love playing online games like Solitaire this is a good one.  I recommend this game.
B008RV5K4U|4.0|I confess I was more than a little bit skeptical when I heard that Time Warner was coming out with an animated film version of Frank Miller's classic 1986 graphic novel [[ASIN:1563893428 Batman: The Dark Knight Returns]], figuring it was yet another venal cash-grab by a company that is not known for its scrupulous behavior, particularly over the last decade or so. I am happy to report I have been proven wrong; this is an excellent film that remains very faithful to Miller's bleak vision of the Darknight Detective. It's also one that, unlike a lot of similiar projects, actually justifies its own existence, at least in my opinion. How is that, you ask? Well, when I read the original graphic novel in the 80s, I recall thinking, \\"This is superhero film noir.\\" Now that it's a movie, it actually IS a film noir (okay, technically it's a neo-noir, but you know what I mean), and quite a good one to boot; I think that's pretty neat.<br /><br />A couple of minor critiques: First, the filmmakers decided to eliminated almost all of the narration from the original comic here. Normally, this would be a valid aesthetic decision; however, I feel that it works against the film here, as it deprives the work of one of its most explictly noirish elements and most (although not all) of its best lines. Secondly, although this film , unlike many of the other DC Universe Animated Movies, is quite easily understandable to the non-fanboy viewer, there is some discussion in the film of Jason Todd (aka the second Robin) that may be  confusing to the neophyte. Fortunately, this is quite easily rectified by a quick perusal of the graphic novel [[ASIN:1401232744 Batman: A Death in the Family]], to which I commend you.<br /><br />My rating: 4 1/2 stars (out of 5). If you enjoyed the first Tim Burton Batman movie or any of the Christopher Nolan ones, you will almost certainly enjoy this one as well.
B009ZZDNT6|1.0|I didn't like.  There were no instructions and i couldn't get it to work. It was a waste of my time and effort. No likee.
B007J4T2G8|2.0|This book must be designed for women who are fascinated by the prospect of being dominated. What a strange affliction.!
B002VPE1WK|5.0|I got this backpack for free with my purchase of my Canon T3i. I wasn't really expecting a whole lot to be honest, but I was completely wrong in my expectations. The backpack is sturdy, contains moveable compartments for a body with lens plus 8 additional lenses. It has 3 compartments for cords and accessories as well as straps to hold a full size tripod. Sturdy with well built zippers and adjustable straps. It is a great starter camera backpack and much cheaper then the name brand ones.
B009VB7QQA|2.0|Boring and slow. Actions scenes are great, however very short. Why am I forced to write 4 more words? I gave my review!
B00AE2J93I|4.0|3year old loved it and had some decent jokes that only parents will get.  I am sure we will watch again
B008Y1YK0I|5.0|My memory of the motion picture Lawrence of Arabia goes back to seeing it in glorious 70mm at a first run theatre in Philadelphia back in the '60s. Having previously purchased a fine DVD copy of the movie, I was hopeful the new Blu-ray version would come even closer to my visual remembrance of that film.<br /><br />To say the least, I wasn't disappointed. On my 55&#34; Panasonic Plasma screen the Blu-ray is superior to the DVD in depth, tonal range, color and detail. For instance, when viewing distant scenes we can still discern details of figures and animals, while in the regular DVD they appear as indistinct blobs. The viewing experience doesn't quite come up to seeing in 70mm on a huge screen in a theatre, but it's as good as it gets on a home screen.
B009GE9Y44|1.0|This is an animated cartoon. I thought it was the new version in the series. Lame. Lame Lame Lame Lame
B00797MB0O|4.0|Patton Oswalt and Charlize Theron make this movie work. Great all the way around: prodction, writing, supporting cast.  Everything great.  I was expecting a more stereotypical \\"girl goes back to small home town\\" with hijinx...but this is a work of art.
B007HACDLK|4.0|AS always Flynn's the Last Man, a very good read, but not up to the best of the  entire series.
B008ULRY78|4.0|Love the movie, nice effects and fight scenes. So-so storyline but typical of this type of movie. This is not like Kungfu Shuffle, which was amazing, but was still quite enjoyable. Don't look for humor here.
1452110581|5.0|This is hilarious. I love animals of all kinds, and if cats suddenly developed the ability to write poetry, these poems would be it!
B00338QENI|5.0|Excellent book!  Enjoyed the combination of learning about Henrietta's family and information about HeLa and the controversy surrounding medical research.  Would highly recommend!
B007SGLZP8|5.0|Well written and kept my interest throughout.  Lots of surprises and with great ending.  The plot was very well thought out.
1423124960|4.0|What more can you ask for, but Disney Princess at bedtime.  If this book would only put the kids to bed also i would have gave it 5 stars.
B0074MZSWW|4.0|Great band! Love!!! Soulful and moving with all the southern rock from the old days infused with their own signature style.
B007MDB548|5.0|My daughters (6,3) love this movie, like any fairy movie this is a must have with girls in the house.  Dont know how much of a lifesaver this is when you pop it in and glue them to the television.
B0094BB4TW|1.0|this version of facebook app is terrible, only loads a few of the most current updates.  you cant go past 6 or 7 post.  Pretty much useless!!<br /><br />this need to be corrected with a proper update the fire hd!
B0074VTHKM|4.0|Another hit!  Especially liked that the story included a child.  A departure from his usual characters, but that ia why it was so interesting.
B008AK8FHM|5.0|Eben Alexander's account of his near death experience is vivid, richly detailed and subjected to the highly educated neurosurgeon's scientific scrutiny. This book gave my almost half century long agnosticism an endpoint. The book is also a great read.
B006LSZECO|4.0|Unexpected Ending.  I will want to read more books by this author.  Have already shared this book with my reading friend.
B007IXWL2C|5.0|This book was awesome I hope the movie comes out soon. Really liked it a lot.  Would recommend it to anyone.
B003XF1XOQ|5.0|A lot of what I read in this series seem to correlate to our own society and the way that it is being transformed into a distinct us versus them mentality. What's next? Will we find the once-poor engaging in putting the once-rich into the Hunger Games for their own self-righteous retribution? Scarry thought!
B007IXWKUK|5.0|This book was awesome I hope the movie comes out soon. Really liked it a lot.  Would recommend it to anyone.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|This game Is really cool. Its like another type of temple run but has a few more options with you being able to change the setting to holiday or getting to have more characters and hover boards!
B000FC12SM|5.0|I have known this book was out there for a while but never took the time to read it.  It points out many basic man/woman conflicts and suggests ways to deal with them.  Wish I had red this book long ago.
B008JGSM6G|5.0|This is a really cool puzzle game and it helps your mind figuring things out and it is reallly fun and is addictive too
B009OYTAL8|5.0|Exciting, realalistic, intelligent great acting<br />Good looking actors great script.<br /><br />Believable story a real super hero.<br /><br />Good balance between the evil and good in people.
B000YHG72E|5.0|I love this movie.  It is one of my favorite holiday films, and brings happiness and cheer to the season.
B000FDEU12|5.0|I was driving when I heard Avi's \\"Ani Ma'amin\\" on WRCJ, and I almost had to pull over. As it is, I raced home to find it, first on Youtube, so I could listen to it again, and then here on Amazon, so I could arder the CD. What an incredible, lyrical piece- and what great bass playing. The entire album is like that- lyrical, melodic, and powerful. Cohen uses a variety of European and Mideastern flavored themes and rhythms and from that creates a very unique and moving music.
B00A31UXLW|5.0|Another of Connelly Harry Bosch series, I have found them all good as I did this one, Harry just keeps getting better!
B005KAH7QU|3.0|Good action movie.  Always fun to watch when someone has exceptional skills.  Eight more words required, so here they are.
B007SGLZP8|3.0|Not up to his earlier standards.  Lots of twists and turns, and it moved along and kept me interested, but, all in all, just a quick moderately entertaining read.
B008Z9YGEE|4.0|Enjoyed this movie.  It is different than others, but could be upsetting to younger children.  Five more words required and written.
B0026WNGBA|4.0|Chi Running explores every aspect of running in detail. The author's passion is evident. I thoroughly enjoyed the book but found myself skimming past the personal details and getting to what mattered: style, form, the how-to, the nitty-gritty.
1478343516|1.0|I had purchased this book (physical copy) for my niece, who begged and pleaded with Santa to get the complete Sherlock Holmes collection.  Reading the reviews here, I figured this was a good deal.  Imagine my surprise when the book arrived, and I leafed through it.  The text is tiny.  Tiny, tiny, tiny.  And not a single paragraph break at all.  Every story, every novel is one long giant paragraph.  How in the holy heck is someone supposed to read this?
B006BY2DBI|5.0|Well, I have read Faulkner, Steinbeck, Camus, Merton, Joyce, Binchy, Walter Macken, Ionesco,Sartre, David Foster Wallace (go, Hal, go), but I have to say that this Englishman shows promise,,,,he is a tad prosey and waxes poetic,,,(perhaps a little too too much porter in the wee hours, yes?),,,,but his prose while flowery, IF GIVEN the TIME and PERSISTENCE,,,,I think most of you in the 21st century might very well benefit from spending sometime reading this kid's plays....sure some of them are about kings and Danes and forest creatures,,,but GIVE HIM A BREAK,,,,maybe he was raised near the woods,,,hmmmm? Sherwood Forest?  but i digress...anyways,,,a lot to keep you busy on those cold lonely nights,,,and who knows,,,maybe some struggling actor group will put on a few of his plays LIVE: maybe on a nice summer night,,,a Midsummer's Dream,,,who knows,,,stay tuned.
B00AMBH70S|4.0|I was wary that Bourne Legacy would disappoint and be a disappointing attempt to cash in on the sucesses without the star power expense. Due to high regard for Jeremy Renner's work, I gave it a chance.<br /><br />I was not disappointed. Action to the nth degree. Cogent logical plot. Superb acting. Jeremy Renner will be a top tier male lead for years to come
0307887448|5.0|This book is very good. Fast paced with characters you care about. It has components of a mystery and an action story set in the future (sci-fi?) but is very Nostalgic about the 80s and 90s pop culture. Very entertaining read if you have any interest in the above.
B00AMBLDEE|4.0|the franchise will definitely live on and the quality of the blue ray was great streaming it. i want to watch it again.
B005NJU8PA|5.0|I bought it for the time hacks Tim always provides as I had no interest in cooking. Now I'm cooking and my wife is astonished.  Me too.  And I have great recipes for the slow carb diet which I follow.
1594202842|2.0|I picked up the book because I heard it was a humorous account of a strict mother.  Having been a strict mother, I thought I'd enjoy it.<br /><br />First I recommended my own children read it.  See, their own mom wasn't so bad after all.<br /><br />Second, I hope Amy and her husband are saving for therapy.  Her children will need some - lots.<br /><br />Third, instead of humorous I found the book sad to the point of depressing.  No amount of framing this as funny can balance the abuse Amy wrought on her children.<br /><br />Fourth - can we say flaming racist?  In reading this book, one discovers that Chinese parents are amazing and their children are exceptional.  And Western parents are inept slugs who barely bother to rear their children.  The level of racism in this book is blatant and shocking.<br /><br />Cultural traditions aside, screaming at her children, denying them basic care so they can practice more hours, robbing them of a childhood, calling them hateful names - that's abuse.  Plain and simple.<br /><br />She excuses her abuse by saying that after each episode her daughter would come and snuggle.  Can we say Stockholm syndrome?<br /><br />I applaud her youngest child for standing her ground and breaking away.  There's hope.<br /><br />If you are a childcare or mental health advocate - read this book - for ammunition and research.<br /><br />If you are a parent, perhaps you'll be comforted to know that no matter how bad you are - you aren't Amy Chua.<br /><br />Amy - get therapy and apologize to your children.  And don't air your sick treatment of them in a public forum if you don't want people saying you are a sad, sick woman.

B009FZHYKU|5.0|We were able to watch the complete season while streaming on my kindle afetr I purchased it. Worth every penny
B00A9C3RB8|1.0|I didn't realize I was ordering a movie via streaming video. I searched all over and could not find how to get my money back and cancel my order. Very bad customer support, shame on you..you big, rich corporate conglomerate, heartless money hogger.
B001TXWJ4M|5.0|AWESOME!!! played well, prespective was great, I recoomend the series to all of my friends. I love amazon . I will continue to purchse
B005LAIH4A|5.0|Fun to watch, great animation.  Good for adults as well as kids.  Has moral points of view it teaches kids about life.  Great entertainment!
B005PK553C|5.0|this is an epic series! Loved the effects and crazy story line.  So glad I purchased it and Season 2.  Loved it!
B009VSW15Y|4.0|Considering the fact that I have not been using it for 24 hours yet, it seems to be quite good as far as definition is concerned.<br />The only drawback is the fact that it is difficult to use it as a casmera when you have to look at it and focus over your shoulder.
B001NTJV6G|5.0|This is an album I already knew I loved. I bought the CD years ago and it's all scratched up now. I was happy to be able to get the digital version on my kindle fire.
B007HACDLK|5.0|I was introduced to Vince Flynn books about 6 years ago, and have since read every book he has written.  The plots are intriquing, the writing is good and although the ending is usually good news, one cannot normally predict how he will get there until the end...and we are always left wanting more - waiting for the next book to come out.
B004I744AS|5.0|What I love about this dictionary: clear pronunciation of the word, definitions from different sources, and translation into the desired language.
0307592731|5.0|I really enjoyed this book and could relate to it on several different levels. I thought this was going to be a book about man vs nature . The will to set a goal and reach that goal through all the difficulty that would arise on such a long journey. There is  element is well documented and leads the reader from the California desert to the final end of this amazing trip. But it reaches into a much deeper experience about having months to work through personal tramas and coming to terms of her life and how everything fit together. Ultimately it is about forgivness and healing. This book reminds me of a movie I saw called \\"The Way\\" and deals with some of the same issues and themes.
B00881VLCE|5.0|Luv this game it is awesome has great free puzzles. The pictures r beautiful. Great for my Kindle fire.I highly recommend. this game.
0062200399|5.0|This was already one of my favorite books and I waited months to buy this edition. It's a proper book (stitched binding and all!) and I love it. Highly recommended.
B008VBYN80|1.0|It basically requires you to spend real money in order to do anything.  It also runs all the time and drains the battery life of your kindle and slows it down.  Do not waste your time with this game.
1400049628|4.0|I've always thought this book was funny when I saw it in stores. Finally bought it as a gift. It's perfect.
B00A8ECU24|5.0|After playing this game for a few minutes, I am completely in love with it. It is a wonderful experience for Bronies. I recommend this game for everypony.
B004SBS8LA|4.0|Althought it isn't the HD version, so the pictures look HUGE, it works fine on my Kindle Fire and is a nice addition to the library of Angry Birds that I have.
0316228532|3.0|J.K. Rowling. Casual Vacancy.  Basically, I think she should stay with Harry Potter.  It catches one's interest, and has some redeeming social message in conveying what everyday British society has become -- the scum left of our heritage.  I read it all, but was unsure to whom I would recommend it.
B00AMBK0X4|3.0|Cute movie but way too much bad language.  It was like their goal was to see how many bad words they could get in there and how many times.
B004X75RCW|5.0|The Proposal was light, encouraging, entertaining and an excellent comedy.  That's why it was given 5 stars!!!  My favorite scene was in the woods with Sandra and Betty White!
B001VFTYW8|5.0|I enjoyed Unnatural Exposure very much.  The characters were well developed and the plot very well done.  I enjoyed it very much and would recommend it to my friends.

B001MSMULG|4.0|I enjoy reading about mystery/thirillers and an a new fan to Daniel Silva's work.  Really enjoyed his writing style and and looking forward to reading the rest of his books about Gabriel Allon.  I always start with the first book in a series and try to keep them in order so I can continue to get to know the characters better.  Anyone who likes a good spy novel will be in for a treat.
B008HK3XKO|5.0|Well made and a good price .Very well thought out in design and is good at many angles.<br />I am done.
B005K17RU0|5.0|Accurate and up to date what else can you ask for. I got this app about a month back and now I plan my days around it.
B00AMGYXP0|5.0|glad to receive the item. Box a little smashed though. Packaging was absolutely horrible! Box was not sealed... was crushed... you could see inside my package because someone was able to press the side which was just a folded together untaped box. It 's amazing my products didn't fall out. Terrible packaging!,, But product gets high rating.
B0027MJU00|5.0|Dark Places is an excellent novel. This is the first book that I have read by Gillian Flynn and I look forward to reading others that she has written.
B000001FDQ|4.0|Malmsteen is an artist by any measure and this is a great example of his skill and finesse. I can't comment on his technique, but as an amateur admirer of guitar, it is truly remarkable what he does on this album
B009GEBBNQ|5.0|My boys absolutely love this movie.  As a mom, I wasn't too thrilled, but was pleasantly surprised.  Very entertaining, even for someone who is not a fan of comics or action movies in general.
B005GFPZYK|4.0|Chris Kyle is not only the real deal as a sniper, but does a very credible job as a writer.  This book kept my interest all the way through and was very well written.
B00AHSIQWE|4.0|I think of the trilogy this was probably my least favorite. Now that isn't to say it was bad, it was a good movie that fit well with the other two movies and wrapped up the trilogy nicely. It just wasn't as good as the first two.
B005FI6IRG|5.0|I had read many of the oter reviews on this disc and thougt they were a little over the top in some cases.<br />I was wrong . This is an &#34;over the top&#34; recording. William Christie has done the world a great service by bringing thes two<br />glorius voices together. The mucic is fascinating and the interpetations superb.<br />In my opinion it is the finest duet singing since the pairing of Joan Sutherland and Marilyn Horne.<br />Thanks guys. I hope we hear more from you in the future.
B007GCY8FS|4.0|Once again, Lee Child delivers a rough and ready Jack Reacher in action.  This is another unusual crime novel in which ex-military policeman Jack Reacher rocks and rolls through the bad guys.  The Reacher stories are more adventure than anything else, but there is a touch of police-procedure in them as well.  If you have any imagination at all, Child's novel has got to be a better way to get to know Jack Reacher than that new film of the same name..  Jack Reacher is over 6 feet tall and is a close combat fighter and a crack shjot.  He could have been credibly played by Nick Nolte or Gérard Depardieu  in their younger days, but someone else, a credible pilot but less than believable street fighter, got the part.  Wanted Man is a great read, a page turner if you like escapist reading, which I guess we all do at some time.  I give this novel a solid four stars, but if you arfe searching for the next Hemingway, you are probably on the wrong shelf..
B006CDCWDM|5.0|I Love Rafa.....and it was great reading his life story......I just can't wait till he returns to Tennis.....Hopefully The Australian!!!
B000N2HCM4|1.0|This book is full of contradictions and inaccuracies.  Many parts don't make sense.  Much of it seems like the imagination of someone who has &#34;delusions of grandeur,&#34; thinking themself to be extraordinarily gifted beyond everyone else.  In summary, this book is a load of ****.
0062082353|5.0|Wow when you read this book it will really open up your eyes and see what our Seals go thru....powerful......
B005SFR7YE|5.0|A wonder stage production of this masterfully accomplished art form!  Keeping in mind that everything was accomplished, live, on stage; the sets, are carefully executed.  The physical limitations of stage verses the &#34;cutting room floor&#34; of Hollywood productions is clear.  Prepare yourself for &#34;the event of a lifetime.&#34;  Flawlessly executed!
B008XX6J4C|5.0|Unexpected sounds that are contemporary, yet classical in so many ways. I would order it again and will  keep an eye on others.
B0086700CM|4.0|I got this game because of all of the internet buzz it was generating. Usually ibuzz is a buzzkill but not this time. Temple Run is fantastic. You get the feeling you're Indiana Jones running for your life to escape. Charming character names, and many objectives to unlock. Imangi Studios has a bright future if they can duplicate the success of this gem.
B007GCY8FS|4.0|Lee Child, Wanted Man<br /><br />As always Lee Child is enjoyable and Jack Reacher leads an enviable life-style.  A delightful fast read.
B00AHSMDQY|4.0|While the Nolan series was a more realistic take on the &#34;Batman  Mystique&#34;, these movies were also very true to the origins of the character. Most people don't realize The Batman is a borderline psychotic. The Dark Knight showcases this psychosis better than any other previous effort. Bruce Wayne is not just some rich playboy playing vigilante. He's a man driven by an obsession. Very action packed yet does not seem to rely heavily on CGI. The one perplexing thing about Bane is no to very little back-story is presented. This worked in the previous film because the Joker was an absolute character. The Bane character needed more development. This was probably Christian Bale's best acting effort and of the three and Gary Oldman is stellar as usual. Overall very enjoyable with a bit of a teaser at the end. Will there be more?
B0096DFBZQ|3.0|Namco started it all in the 70s with the original Pac Mac, then followed it up with the wildly successful Ms. Pac Man. This game builds on that fun and offers hours of enjoyment. I played the game on an Android tablet and so far have had hours of enjoyment. What makes a game great is you play it over and over. If this were in an arcade I would have already spent quite a few rolls of quarters.
B006LSZECO|5.0|Gillian Flynn is an amazing author, I hope she keeps putting out books like this! I read this in just one day!
B00866H7SS|2.0|I did not enjoy Syliva Day's Bared to You Novel.<br />The story line was not well developed the situations the characters found themselves in was very unrealistic.
B00571F26Y|5.0|This is a must read and will have you looking a labels more closely.  I wish I would have read it a long time ago.  Read and wonder what if? and why?
B00BEZTMQ8|4.0|3 1/2 Stars = Very Good<br /><br />As a big fan of \\"the Lord of the Rings\\" trilogy, which I consider the best trio of films ever made, I was ecstatic to hear about a prequel trilogy in \\"the Hobbit\\" & that Peter Jackson was helming them! I know many don't share that point of view on this new trio of films that have read the books, but as I have not read either \\"the Lord of the Rings\\" or \\"the Hobbit,\\" it pretty much goes without saying that I'm not here to compare the movies to books, but movies to movies. So with much relish, I went to \\"the Hobbit: An Unexpected Journey\\" today, & to be honest, I was not overwhelmed, but I was not underwhelmed either.<br /><br />Yes, I went into this film reading several reviews about it, so I was not expecting the pure cinematic magic & genius of the prior films, & I didn't get that, but I got a film that may go on to classic status, but never masterpiece. Without giving a million things away about the film, I will say that there are several down falls here. For one, \\"the Hobbit: An Unexpected Journey\\" does not have the feeling of impending doom & desperation that the first three have. It veers to far towards a children's film the first half of the movie, with to much cuteness & comedy taking place, & not enough serious content. Though it starts out pretty good in setting the story up the first 15-20 minutes, one has to wonder how the dwarves ever made it to the status of overlords? Their pretty much portrayed as something more akin to \\"Snow White & the Seven Dwarves,\\" as all except a couple of the dwarves are inept in their intelligence, & seem to want to just eat, drink & be merry. Here I think Jackson made the same mistake as \\"Star Wars\\" episodes, \\"Return of the Jedi\\" (discounting the final show down between Luke, Darth Vader, & the Emperor), & \\"the Phantom Menace.\\" Jackson dummied the movie down to appeal to a young audience, taking the chance of alienating the older adult audience. Also, another mistake made in this film is that Jackson threw everything he could possibly dream up in \\"Middle Earth,\\" & tossed it at you like a asteroid hurdling towards you through the movie screen at the speed of light. I mean, there was two, maybe three times the variety of creatures than previous films, & just to many characters to really be able to grasp & hold on to, & feel a real connection with. There was just to much shoved into a to small time frame of space, even if the film is almost three hours long. In this respect, \\"the Hobbit: An Unexpected Journey\\" pales before the first three films, but then again, this is a very tall order, & Jackson is proved to be human after all.<br /><br />Even with all I said I didn't like about \\"the Hobbit: An Unexpected Journey\\" there is more I liked. I really can't put a finger on it, but I feel this film will grow on me with repeated viewings. It has a great premise, & a director that is capable of taking it to greater heights with the two following films, if he fixes the mistakes made here. I do have to say the 3-D was amazing, & really made \\"Middle Earth\\" come to life, though in the fast moving sequences, there was some blur with the background. This will most likely be fixed & improved on. It also does not hurt that many characters from \\"The Lord of the Rings\\" have returned with the same actors. I look forward to their roles & the part they'll play in the future films!<br /><br />All in all, this is a film that may reach classic status with me in time. It was a huge undertaking, & had almost the impossible task to live up to \\"Lord of the Rings.\\" For the time being, I'll rate this a very good film, that you should see for yourself & make your own opinion. It is well worth the watch!Jackson threw everything he could possibly dream up in \\"Middle Earth,\\" & tossed it at you like a asteroid hurdling towards you through the movie screen at the speed of light.

B00AECGQF2|5.0|One way to save Barbie's hair!  My daughter LOVES this.  Rather than cutting and trying to color her dolls' hair, she is able to get her fix with this great game/app.  We also have the first edition too. This is cute, clean (no pun intended) fun.  The audio for each styling makes it more real and though some of the 'customers' are a bit odd looking, it doesn't take away from the fun.  Have to admit that I enjoy playing as well.

B007SGLZP8|4.0|A classic Grisham story that is really fun and fast paced. I would expect it to soon  be a movie.
B008AK8FHM|5.0|This book has given me a very strong conviction that consciosness is a basic web in cosmos. This web is not part of the material world as science define it at present. All life have souls wich are parts of this web and therfore immortal. Science must aksept this and start redefine tid limits. This conviction comfort an old man.
B0093LINVK|5.0|Pros: Tiny.  Extremely quiet (like almost inaudible with your ear right up against it).  Draws between 6 - 12 watts normally while running, almost nothing when in standby. Very sturdy case, made with engineering grade plastic (think high end DSLR plastic) backed by steel - case has zero flex.  Easy to assemble.  Mount for back of monitors with open vesa mount, very secure/sturdy mount.  Cool graphical BIOS.<br /><br />Cons: Software installation more complicated due to lack of optical drive (obviously) and lack of native Win7 ethernet drivers.  Would be nice if they included Centrino Wireless N-Bluetooth module in Kit.  Mickey mouse power cable (only $2.99 online) not included.  Hdmi output needs adapter for DVI monitors.  Needs usb audio dongle ($7) for non HDMI use.<br /><br />I assembled mine in about 10 minutes with 8G (2x4) of Mushkin DDR3 Ram and a 120G Mushkin Msata Drive and the 6235 Centrino module (about $30) for Bluetooth and Wireless-N with zero issues.  To install Win7 from a USB key I needed to create an .iso of the Win7 install DVD and then create a bootable USB key using a utility Microsoft supplies on their website.<br /><br />At a minimum have the intel chipset drivers and ethernet drivers downloaded on your usb key and install them first, then you can use the tool on intel's support site to auto detect the rest of the missing drivers.  If you try using the auto detect tool on intel's website prior to having the chipset drivers installed it will crash or hang due to how the probe works.<br /><br />Note Windows will try to make the bluetooth work out of the box with Win-7 intall but you need the intel bluetooth driver installed for it to actually work.<br /><br />I replaced my kids clunky 4 year old desktop PC with this by mounting it to the vesa mount of an old acer monitor.  It only had DVI so I needed a cheap adapter($7) for hdmi->dvi and usb sound ($7).  The old pc was a Core2 8500 (3.2Ghz) with 8 GB and this runs circles around it due to the flash drive.  I'm using a bluetooth mouse/keyboard and it's a great all-in-one PC now!  I can see them having HDMI due to small adapter size and compatibility with TVs but I do with they would break the audio out, little usb sound key sticking out is not clean.  On a hdmi monitor/tv you'll have no prob since audio is carried over the hdmi of course.

B00170MYIS|4.0|This battery should be sold in a bundle pack One is not enough. Charge time a little long but life is good. Unique in its size, Sony really limits your choice for replacement. There maybe be knock offs but they are nowhere close to the actual Sony battery.
B001C4AFOY|5.0|Considering this is based on a true event, this a wonderful love story. To take a bullet for someone you love has to be the most unselfish test of true love. Lovely scenery and gowns a must see for victorian fans.

B001JIHGO0|5.0|Love the action and romance between the two stars. Big fan of Jackman and he is ever HOT in this movie, even down to his hat and coat. If you're a fan of the vampire being the &#34;bad guy&#34; in a quirky way you'll love this movie
B002ZG99QS|3.0|The graphics are insane and as a Tron fan I looked forward to this movie. Story line dragged out however and if it wasn't for the graphics I would probably have fallen asleep. I like movies that I can watch over and over again. This is not one of them. Maybe in 3-5 years, I will pick it up again.
0767020308|5.0|Before she became a bombshell this role as Emma is sweet and endearing. She plays Emma as an innocent young victorian who starts out as a snob and grows up learning life's lessons. I think Jane Austen would approve of this version of her book

B0086213XW|3.0|As others have noted, this film takes a subject as old as mankind, and adds nothing to the discussion.  It does, however, put a portrait of its generation on the wall among the others.  Aesthetically, the film reminds me of &#34;Portlandia&#34; although none of the characters are all that quirky, but, they certainly do have their issues, some more than others.<br /><br />Sarah Silverman adds comic relief with her usual brand of straight-on, twisted nice girl schtick.  Some early scenes seem badly filmed, but by the middle they seem to have settled into a vintage-postcard look, with much of the movie filmed in an attractive part of Toronto that seemed to suggest the American South (without the southerners).  Much of the film seems to take place in the summer, everyone glistens with sweat and table fans are everywhere.  I found the interior spaces especially appealing.<br /><br />The story...<br /><br />Michelle Williams plays a skittish character with fears of being afraid (might as well, nobody else has done it) and of connections.  This becomes quite literal as the movie progresses---any love scene or attempted love scene, either with her puppy-dog of a husband or her paramour abruptly ends if someone touches her.  Being a modern girl, of course, this is all about &#34;them&#34; not her.  Everyone else has to adapt to her, she doesn't have to make any effort to examine her unreasonable behavior.  If you think about it, it's a great way to get control over others, and call the shots.  As a result, her character was too repelling for my tastes and her appearances tended to irritate me more than draw any sympathy.<br /><br />Then there's the idea of the marriage.  What's wrong with it?  It's not that her husband doesn't touch her, as one reviewer stated:  If anyone touches her, she pulls away, until the end of the film.  She seems to have a good if strange marriage, but that could define a lot of couples.  Why is she so attracted to this one guy, a timid artist who won't show his work?  In the end, she runs off and he finds her and it appears that the attraction is the transitory appeal of the new, as all of the sex in the film is at the end---all at once---and at one point, a second woman shows up, then a second man, and then she goes &#34;home&#34; when it turns out that Silverman (her stepsister, an alcoholic) has gone off on a binge, and it appears that she's (Williams) dumped her marriage for a life of sex.<br /><br />The selfishness of Williams character and the general lack of maturity that seems to characterize too much of that generation were to me a flaw that hurt the film.  I liked looking at the film, I liked the spaces, and some of the faces, but overall it was the characters that took what might have been a four star film and left it with three.
B005NPBT5M|4.0|There isn't much more to say about it. If you don't know about this album, then you probably won't want it:) Loved it in Highschool so I grabbed a copy when it was on sale. There are some really good songs on here, even if much of it is so overplayed that it has become a bit of a joke.
B00AMBLXP8|5.0|If you like Family Guy you will love this movie,  great cast, love Mark Wahlberg. Its a must see.  Yeah
B009OYSFDM|5.0|Arrow is really like no other show on air right now. It's like robin hood by how he rights the wrong of people in power over the city. And then similar to Batman by the technology and devices he uses. There are twists and unexpected turns that leave you wondering what this family, this city has done to be so corrupt, that Oliver Queen will risk his life to make it right. This show is one I can't stop watching!
B004SJ3BCI|4.0|Grreat for free. Could use a few more levels/games without paying angry birds angry birds angry birds ! Swat pigs
B009FZHYKU|5.0|Saw my first episode of TWD during a marathon on AMC...it was somewhere in the middle of season 2 and spooked me...stopped watching asi don't usually like these kinds of shows. Fast forward to watching season 3 episode 1 on demand...was so drawn in I couldn't stand it...half way through episode 1, h opted onto amazon and order season 1 and 2. By the end of episode 1, season 3, I was heading to Target to buy the DVDs  right then and there because it is THAT GOOD!<br /><br />Just an amazing cast of characters, well written show...for a girly single mom who owns her own business and hates scr ay movies...this is my absolute favorite show hands down
B009RI4FRU|5.0|this is a very nice move, we enjoyed it a lot! I will recommend it to my friends ! !
B000I8H7RI|5.0|There are lots of layers to this film<br />Tippi Hedren is very good as well as Rod Taylor and Jessica Tandy<br />Can seem a bit out there, but look up references or studies to enhance overall understanding
B00AA0TJO8|3.0|I purchased this game for my sons, ages 6 and 9.  We all thought drawing your own stick figure to use in-game was a ton of fun.  My boys would constantly re-draw their figures and laugh at all the new creations.<br /><br />I did not play the game, but watched a bit of the gameplay.  It looked to be pretty entertaining, it is a puzzle-type game of interacting with the game environment.  It looked to be fun to play, but both my kids quickly tired of the game and I don't think they have played it after that first day.  This is out of character, they rarely lose interest in a  game so quickly.<br /><br />The game is cleverly done, and worth the few bucks to buy.  The gameplay itself seems a little easy.  It does foster creativity, which is always a plus.
0131103628|5.0|I'm a college student with CS major, I found this book the most important book ever in my career, every time I started over reading it, I learned more. It is not just a book, it is the bible that every programmer should read and dig.
B0019I6WDG|5.0|I love this movie because of the dry humor and the corky music. I can't even begin to tell you how many times I've watched this movie over and over again!
B00957T6X6|5.0|Great books.  I am watching the videos and find this helps to keep track of the characters.  It is very good.
B009LHWEKW|2.0|Supernatural is a great show. Enough said about that. If you've made it to season 8, then no review is needed.  I was disappointed in Amazons picture quality though. I was expecting to be able to play it through my tv but found that when I streamed it through my computer to my tv the picture got jerky at times. Netflix streaming is significantly better and smoother. I had high hopes for Amazin to get in the streaming market but they just aren't there yet. Downloading and watching videos works great. However, Amazin just can't pull off tv quality streaming yet. Too bad.
B007SGLZP8|5.0|twists and turns as only grisham can do.  I was feeling that his story lines were all starting to read alike, but this one was different and had me turning the pages faster.  A good read.
B009JBZH54|5.0|Who wouldn't want to get the whole series on Blu Ray and it comes with a few extras and all 3 movies on digital format that you can watch on your computer, video game console, phone.
B00A6PD8RQ|5.0|We watched this film with our 3 teenage children.  Pixar films are great for both the young and older viewers.  Brave continues Pixar's films providing subtle adult humor mixed with with plenty of lovable characters and action for younger viewers.  We especially liked the theme of mending hurt feelings and broken families.  We can all learn lessons from Brave and be entertained at the same time.<br /><br />We would recommend this film to friends and family.
B008Y2FRFO|5.0|there is some thought in playing this or it can be mindless fun....like that coins replenish them selves over time....works great on my kindle fire
B005IQZB14|5.0|From the first page, I couldn't put the book down.  It is exciting, heart rendering and thought provoking.  My mother died when I was 40 and I could so identify with Cheryl's raw feelings and her descriptions of her love for her mother.<br />My only disappointment is that I wanted to give it to my 16 year old son and there were 2 parts I thought were inappropriate for a teen.  Otherwise, it would be a &#34;G&#34; rated book for all audiences!
B00AHSIQWE|5.0|I am a huge batman fan, and this one has to be my new favorite. I love how everything was left and how most of what I love about the story of batman is included in the trilogy thanks to this film.
B000I9U9A4|5.0|One of the best performances I've seen.  I've had a copy for several years and watched it many times.  When my brother visits he often ask to watch it again.  In fact I just bought another copy for my son.  My one regret is that there hasn't been a sequal.
B009VB97EY|1.0|We made it as far as we did in this movie because I was certain there might be some sort of plot. Because movies have plots, right?<br /><br />3/4 of the way through it still hadnt really developed so we just had to turn it off.<br /><br />The acting was terrible too.
B007ZRZF8I|3.0|My kids enjoy this game and free is always alright with me.  I think Amazon games are worth the space.
B009RI4FRU|4.0|It was funny, witty & adolescently romantic(in a good way). I really didn't expect to like it as much as I did & that's what makes a great movie.
B005HSL626|1.0|My kids enjoy this game and free is always alright with me.  I think Amazon games are worth the space.
B000V63BN6|5.0|This is a great collection of my favorite Stevie Wonder songs at a very low price.  It is the Definitive Collection.
B004SJ3AXI|4.0|Love the seasonal game and the kids can't get enough. It does update alot and takes up quite a bit of space, but fun.
B0090EJR1K|5.0|amazingly funny movie. Not sure how i missed it. Good fun to watch with friends and family. Especially the US portions of the movie
B007N9FKCY|2.0|It's like a test of patience.  It's not so much a technique,  but feats of timing you have to succeed within th game.<br /><br />Its like torture after few minutes, rather than a fun game.
B003VS0CWY|5.0|Loved it!<br />Don't like the requirements for commenting. Guess I won't do any more reviews. 5 more words required, enough
030759565X|5.0|Great author's notes and tips for each recipe.  Beautiful photographs.  Wholesome ingredients although a few were not at my local grocery store.
B00475AYJQ|5.0|Great second installment to the Kingkiller Chronicle. More than lives up to the expectation created by his first book &#34;The Name of the Wind&#34;
B000JMKTLO|5.0|This held me all the way through.  I liked it better than her Gone Girl book which I thought was excellent.
1844137864|5.0|All of the witty, satiric humour you'd come to expect from Banksy; plus several amazing snapshots with commentary from the artist.
B0085YNML2|4.0|its pretty fun. I got it for free so i cant complain. It reminded me ALOT of cut the rope.
B008IYR2BA|5.0|I really enjoyed Dexter's journey into understanding his darkness and realizing his light.  Knowing his darkness would not exist without light was just...well....beautiful!
0345803485|5.0|The book that got me hooked was on my doorstep quicker than i could have found it in the bookstore.  Great book, great service, will definitley order again!
B004OC07F8|5.0|If you have an open mind.. you will get it. If not go back to your corproate world, bring home a pay check and retire.<br />If you want to honestly make a change to help your company.. then heed these words.
0345803507|5.0|For those of us who have read this series you can imagine the turmoil i found myself in when i finished #2, and didnt have #3.  Thanks to this seller that changed in the blink of an eye.  Thank you!!
B0063IH60K|4.0|I just like to play the game when time is open. Like the different variants that are available and the training video.
B00913DPW2|3.0|To me this game is a bit confusing.  I never really know what to do next.  I wish when you clicked on something it would kind of tell you what you should be doing or looking for.
B0050R0XEG|5.0|It took about 2 days for our 9 yr old boy to assemble this.  It was pretty smooth and he enjoyed the aesthetically made interiors.  He found the expanding roof to be the hardest one to keep steady.  He worked hard on that portion alone.
B007V5XT1O|4.0|This may be something on my end, but still haven't figured out how to access the digitial booklet that supposedly came with this download.  The album is fabulous!  RAVE
B00A8ECU24|1.0|Make for damn sure in app buying turned off if you let your child use this! Built to pick mom and dads pocket
B002W2U3H4|5.0|Good quality and very easy to access via the Smart TV application installed on the HDTV.  I would recommend this movie to anyone.
B00AMBK0X4|4.0|very funny, like his other irreverent stuff, no taboo subjects, yet adds some humanity to the absurd, Wahlberg hits it also.
B000929AJQ|5.0|I pretty much like the whole album, especially since \\"The line begins to blur\\" is one of my favorite songs by them. Anyways, good CD.
B006CQLGXG|5.0|Great retelling of this classic story I have a hardbound edition of the annotated edition, but sometimes it is best to just read it as it was published originally.
B00004Z459|5.0|I love their first two CD's. Every single song on this album I like. I like the beat, the lyrics, all of it. I'm not a fan of their newer albums... They have completely changed. Oh well, at least I can still always listen to their old stuff.
B0073LWEXK|3.0|I liked this game--not really tricky but very fun for the price.  My kids enjoyed playing it too--the content is very kid-friendly.
B00008H2LB|5.0|I love this CD by them. I like their old stuff, not so much their new CD's. They really have changed, not for the better in my opinion. Oh well, I will stick to Meteora and Hybrid Theory. Amazing albums.
B004MC8CA2|5.0|This Bible app is fabulous because you get to choose from many different versions that'll help you better understand the words of God and His disciples.
034580404X|5.0|Great books!!  The books keep you entertained from beginning to end.  I am so happy I bought them when I did.
B0094BB4TW|5.0|It's Facebook, what more can I say?  If you liie Facebook, then of course you'd like the app for your Kindle.  It really just make the display from your Android phone a lot bigger.
B000Q6GUW0|5.0|So many people were talking about this show so I thought I would order this dvd.  I'm so glad I did.  Its keeps you holding your breathe and thinking what's next.
B000W93CHC|5.0|Simply a good read with great characterization. Greed, selflessness, love, hate, forgivable, unforgivable.  It runs the gamut of humanness and lack of humanity, Highly recommend for escape reading.
B004ZJZPXO|5.0|Terrific!!!  For those who love adventure with a GREAT cast.  The network should be shot for canceling this series. OK?
B008LY9AWG|5.0|Each of the three stories in this book could easily be made into a movie!  The stories are compelling and extremely well written. I have great admiration for authors who can tell such a great story in so few words.
B004ZN9RWK|5.0|This is one of the greatest albums for all time.  Still stands up today<br />and it will never get old.
B00AMBK0X4|3.0|Occasionally raunchy, but if you're not easily offended and like male humor, you'll love this. I saw the uncut version.
B000HC2LI0|5.0|This is a great series and really stands up even today.  I have given this as a gift<br />and everyone loves it.
B006GECE9Y|5.0|Allows viewing of websites that other browsers do not work well on.<br /><br />An excellent replacement of the standard Android browser.
B0097EWK3A|5.0|I loved this game! I have enjoyed Big Fish computer games before, especially the mystery ones and this one for the Kindle does not dissapoint.  The graphics are great.  Not only are there a boat load of missing object scenes, but the other puzzles take some thought to figure out. Some people may not like that the game takes you to the same location multiple times, but I didn't mind that part and found it easy to track my progress by using the map inside the notebook.  A great play and well worth the cost.
B0096DFBZQ|5.0|I think I had the chance to play this once or twice. The kids found it on my tablet and now I have not had a chance to get back to it.....
B000YHG72E|3.0|Obviously created for a younger audience...which is fine but I was expecting more laughing out loud than I received.  It's still worth the watch if you can't find Christmas Vacation.
B007SGM084|5.0|THE best books I've ever read! I see myself re-reading these over and over for years to come! I can't wait to read whatever E.L.James has in store for us next!
B008AK8FHM|5.0|I do not buy in completely it was still a good read.  Much of it took a leap of faith and I have already allocated my faith for this lifetime.
B00574PQDU|4.0|This movie was not what I expected going in but was a worth a watch. Although I am a guy who mostly likes action movies and I thought that this was going to be more of the typical action type movie and it wasn't, I liked it just the same.  Matt Damon and Emily Blunt are fun to watch and there is enough shmoopiness for many women to like it as well.  This would probably work as a couples date night movie.
B0031Q0XCA|5.0|It doesn't get much better than Zooey Deschanel and Joseph Gordon-Levitt in the same movie!  The chemistry between Zooey and Joseph is amazing!
B00AMBLDEE|4.0|I gave this movie 4 stars because it unexpectedly fits very well with the rest of the Bourne series, which is my favorite action series.  Jeremy Renner does not replace Matt Damon but he wasn't meant to as his character is that of another agent serving during the same timeline as Jason Bourne.  Renner's character does not have the same range of emotional vulnerability nor the feeling of mental toughness as the Jason Bourne charactor but that is okay as the movie makes it clear that the two characters are not competing in any way.<br />Rachel Weiss' character does an excellent job in this movie, even better in my opinion than the female actors in the Matt Damon movies, and that adds needed dimension in this movie. Overall very good movie for fans of the Bourne series if you watch with no preconceptions.
B005CVWWJY|5.0|Just Great. If you lived or even If you are a fan of the 80s, you are in for a awesome book.
B009GEEMLY|4.0|I am not a fan of any of the comic book based movies as I didn't grow up reading the comic books and feel that those who did tend to be a little fanatical and immature even in adulthood.  With that said, I have an open mind and really liked this movie.  The dialog was witty and funny and the action was very intertaining.  Well worth the the time and price even if you are not a geeky comic fan.
B009X01FJS|3.0|This feel like a quality case, however, it adds weight to the Kindle HD which is already on the hefty side.  Another negative is that there is no opening in the case to plug in the Kindle for charging. You have to lay the Kindle down with the case open.
B002GJI8PM|5.0|love all three LotR soundtracks, almost more than the movies themselves. these in particular emphasize how fundamental a good score is to the success of movie (not commercial success necessarily, but success in having a lasting impact). these stand on their own as marvelous compositions that are a joy to experience.
B00AHSINKO|2.0|Everyone says this is a great movie. While the acting was certainly outstanding, the story itself was fundamentally and wildly depressing. Not at all the &#34;funny&#34; experience so many friends had suggested it was. And the eventual resolution was rushed and rather lacking in credibility - even for superficial Hollywood. Not a bad moivie, I suppose, but just not entertaining. Unless, of course, you haven't had sex for umpteen years and then perhaps it would be cathartic...
B00AIQP9DE|4.0|Pretty good game, played it Straight through.  It kept me interested.  Fun graphics, cool cutscenes, and nice audio.  I recommend this for all.
B002NZTZ8S|5.0|Our kids really enjoy this movie at Christmas, it has become a tradition with our family to watch it some time between Thanksgiving and Christmas.
B000062V9C|5.0|We were unaware that this movie would not play in the United States DVD players. We had no idea what Region 2 meant. What a disappointment it was for our 3 year old granddaughter that it didn't work. We had to return it. Very disappointed that there was no disclaimer on the website.
B00A6PD9I4|3.0|The idea and themes of the film are strong, but the overall execution of the story has many weak places and points that cause the watcher to go &#34;wait a sec...&#34;. Many of these could have been easily fixed with a ten-second shot or one line but were not. I won't give examples, so as not to spoil anything for those who still want to see it. As I said to my husband, &#34;I'd certainly be happy to have our daughter see it, but I won't make any push to expose her to it or buy it since it just isn't what I've come to expect from something with Pixar's name on it.&#34;
B001EN71CW|5.0|This is my favorite sci-fi series, though it's admittedly a space western if you're judging strictly.  Excellent writing, direction, and cast.  It's a shame it was cancelled so early in it's run.  When I get depressed on seeing yet another reality show popping up on cable, Firefly still often gets a spin in the PS3.
B0085Z3B2Q|4.0|Good movie, I just wish they had the little five minuet original cartoon. ( plus I like that I can keep the blue-ray and give my mom the DVD)
B0076DELIG|4.0|Well crafted mystery within a cold case<br />Det. Harry Bosch,Police procedural .<br />It's a  \\"Can't -Put- It-Down\\" Michael Connelly crime  novel! Great Fun!
B001EN71CW|5.0|I was so glad when they put these out on blue-ray. There are no translated captions for the Chinese. Other than that, just what I was looking for!
B00AMBLXP8|3.0|Definitely expecting more out of Ted.  I laughed, but there are funnier and more clever movies out there.  Could have done without the serious relationship stuff
B0025KW29U|5.0|First thing I asked my hubby after watching this was: Was it time for Joss to make another colt classic already?
B00846REIS|4.0|Fan-Freaking-Tastic! Loved this book. Had such a better story line than 50 shades. Can't wait till the next one comes out!
B00AMBK0X4|4.0|I am 68 years old. I enjoy watching a variety of different movies. I watch most moveis for the sheer entertainment that they provide. I make an effort to only watch movies that have been rated at least three stars or more. I have been known to stop watching some movies within the first five to ten minutes. I added that to let you know that I am not one to just watch something for the sake of watching it. Some movies I refuse to watch because of who is in the movie. I have always enjoyed most ot Mark Wahlberg's movies. I can't say the same for Will Ferrell or Adam Sandler, just to name a couple that I would not watch at all. This movie is light hearted and funny.
B009ERK1T0|5.0|This is one of the best records of the year. The deftones have been one of my favorite bands since high school because they always put out amazing albums. All the songs are great and are examples of what they do best-heavy,melodic music.
B003WE9TU8|5.0|If you want a zombie book with a difference then World War Z is the one to go for. It's a tough book to review because it is so unconventional. There are no characters to get comfortable with and no plot line to speak off. What you have is a series of interviews detailing the zombie invasion. Sounds boring doesn't it? At page one I thought it was going to be hard book to get through. I was wrong. The brilliance of World War Z is sheer scope of the author's research. He's looked at the idea of a zombie war from every conceivable aspect. His interviews cover social, religious, political, family, celebrity and any aspect you can imagine. There are interviews with astronauts, submarine commanders, blind Japanese warriors, soldiers, mercenaries, spooks and politicians. Brooks has covered all the bases. The accounts are well written and engaging on every level. An intelligent concept that was cleverly executed within one of the most fanciful areas of modern fiction. A great and very different read.
B00AMBH70S|2.0|Filmography is nothing like the original Bourne films. Worth seeing just to see I guess, but just a little boring.
0142420891|5.0|Couldn't wait to get this sequel!  Purchased 1st book for my teenage daughter as required reading for school and we both became hooked!
B00AMBH70S|3.0|Action packed, just not as polished as the ones with Jason Bourne.  Worth a look see... Just don't expect Jason Bourne!
014241543X|5.0|purchased for by daughter's required summer reading for school.  We both loved this book and immediately purchased the follow-up from Amazon and couldn't wait for it to arrive.
B007VUA7VO|5.0|I love it I no longer have to look at the little battery on the top I now have battery hd.
B007FTZDN8|5.0|The point of TED seems to be to present information that is unique and not thought about in the media. TED achieves this goal, but it depends upon the conference. I have listened to some of the &#34;popular&#34; conferences, &#34;School kills creativity&#34;, etc, and I thought these were awesome, and they were sprinkled with humor.
1451695195|5.0|Should be required reading for all the curious about the after life.It is also a great read on a cool stormy day just get a blanket wrap up and enjoy.
B002PEP4U0|4.0|This is an amazing, true story about an amazing child who educates himself and persists in building a windmill that ultimately provides electricity for his family's home.  Getting through the drought and famine takes some perseverance on the reader's part, but the story is well worth it.
B000W27AE0|5.0|I can say honestly that this album is a part of my life. I don't mean it's incorporated in my daily life but throughout my years this album has cried with my soul ,laughed with my soul and soothed my soul. and when I hear these songs I feel like I'm whole again.
B004MC8CA2|5.0|Easy to search for specific verses.  Great plan options for daily devotions or bible reading schedules.  Love that it will read the text aloud...definitely helps with some of the hard to pronounce words!
B003YV0A02|5.0|I actually just saw this for the first time, and really enjoyed it. I can't believe it took me so long! I would definitely recommend it!
B009NQKPUW|4.0|Great movie, If your a die hard scifi fan. I really can't wait until part two. Take a chance on this movie decide for yourself.
B005S9EJ46|5.0|Great cast, good script and a cinematic delight.  Its one of those films that you can watch over and over again.
B00AMBLXP8|5.0|Movie is one of the best love it. I got to purchase Ted for Christmas :) He will be my best friend lol
B001ANSSDC|3.0|This was a good, easy read. The only thing I was upset about is that it spoils the ending to a few \\"classics\\" that I have yet to read! A Farewell to Arms, The Scarlet Letter, and The Great Gatsby are the three I recall, there may be others that I've already read.
B001NLKT60|5.0|Picked it up,  couldn't put it down.  Great reading from start to finish. Looking forward to reading The girl who kicked the hornets nest.
B005HSL626|5.0|I love this game! It is a good way to send time while waiting. And free. Can not beat that!
B0076DELIG|3.0|What you'd expect from a Harry Bosch novel. Not very exciting or interesting. Certainly far short of his best when he wrote \\" the poet\\"
B005LAIH4A|5.0|It was a very cute movie..I bought it for the grandkids for christmas..they couldnt wait to watch it..we have watched it 3 times already..
B001JNNE64|5.0|I bought this used because it is one of my favorite movies(but i didn't want to spend too much money), and it came like new!!!
0345803507|5.0|These books speak for themselves.  Ok, yes, they have a lot of adult nature scenes... but the story is so good that it's really not about that in my opinion.  Not the best writing ability, but who cares, the story outweighs that hundred times over.
B004SJ3BCI|5.0|Absolutely love this!  It really makes me laugh!  Challenging, too!  Keeps me entertained for hours.  Great game!  Would recommend it.
0812993357|5.0|This is a great chatty take on the fashion magazine industry of the past fifty years, told with good humor, honesty, sugar and salt. Coddington is real, saw it all, and tells all. She didn't do drugs, she says, and there is not a lot of boring stuff like that. She did wear and then style the top fashions of five decades, with the top photographers, and editors of the day, and we get what seems like an unstudied reminiscence. Very readable, and I just wish I could have regular dinners with Coddington. What a trip!
B003O86FMW|5.0|This kept me on the edge of my seat just like the first book, and had my heart beating rapidly in some parts. Can't wait trad the next book.
B005I4JG80|5.0|Helps provide perspective to parenting from a different part of the world, and perspective is always good when you are tackling something as hard as raising children!
B007SGLZP8|4.0|Good and fun read with memorable characters and a scheme that is convoluted and interesting to the reader.  Grisham builds the plot and characters well.
B0058A119G|3.0|I was expecting some new songs rather than more of the old ones therefore I was disappointed with this album although I'm a big Streisand fan.
B004DI7HZ6|5.0|Couldn't put it down once I started it. Recommended or all who loved Twilight, Harry Potter or anything like it.
B00957T6X6|5.0|I saw these books for many years before I finally picked it up when I got my kindle. On one hand, I am glad that I held off until I had 5 books to read, on the other hand - these books are amazing!  I love how each chapter is set-up, and the author has such a great flow - I finished book 1 in a week and now am almost done with book 2.... so exciting!
0142419400|5.0|Anna's father is a well known author, and with that comes the idea (since he's rich and all) of sending Anna to boarding school - in Paris. Now to think getting to study in Paris is an amazing experience, but not to Anna. She feels like she's leaving her entire life in Atlanta and venture into the unknown.<br /><br />But lo and behold, things seem to work out for her after all. Getting shipped off to Paris wasn't as bad as she thought. She makes new friends, eats great food, explores the wonderful city, and befriends swoon-worthy, Etienne St. Claire. Too bad he has a girlfriend, and Anna is somewhat \\"unavailable\\" as well.<br /><br />While things might be getting bad over at Atlanta, she find comfort in hanging out with St. Claire. Gladly he feels likewise, but with this comes the growing feeling of falling in love with the already-taken best friend. And as Anna tries to fight off her feelings for St. Claire, he somehow makes it even harder...<br /><br />I never thought I'd find myself enjoy a contemporary chic lit novel this much. Don't get me wrong, I enjoy chic literatures now and then but I never found them as lovable as Anna and the French Kiss. It's so cute and light that it makes me mushy. I have no idea why it is a wonderful story, it just is!<br /><br />There are several things that made this book work for me: I admire Anna for trying to do the right thing. She doesn't want to be the girl that a guy cheats with over their girlfriends. I like the idea that St. Claire isn't the tall, dark, handsome dude that has been the stereotype over male leads. The idea of being in Paris is just divine! *sigh* Who doesn't want to experience touring Paris, right?<br /><br />Anna and St. Claire's story just proves that love really does happen in so many forms. You can't settle for the images of a love story that you, yourself formulated on your own. When it happens, it happens... and it's your choice whether to take the leap or not.<br /><br />Anna and the French Kiss is the epitome of a cheesy chick flick - there's the romantic setting (Paris), a protag looking to fit in (Anna), the hot but unfortunately unavailable best friend (St. Claire), and then there's the ever beautiful girlfriend of the best friend. Come to think of it, there's nothing really new to this book... BUT Stephanie Perkins sure knows how to turn a simple story to an all out beautiful, tickled pink tale.epitome of a cheesy chick flick - there's the romantic setting (Paris), a protag looking to fit in (Anna), the hot but unfortunately unavailable best friend (St. Claire), and then there's the ever beautiful girlfriend of the best friend.

1594203334|5.0|If you are looking for some rigid list of how to raise your child, find another book.  If you're looking for a good story that makes you think about why and how you parent - read this!  This will make you wonder and make you laugh.  It gives good insights on how sometimes its a little like this, and sometimes its a little like that, but its all within the framework that you set-up.<br /><br />My most ah-ha! moment came when they made note of how French children say hello and good-bye to all adults, and how that elevates them to respecting the adults, but also for the adults to respect them.  This was when I looked around at my friends' houses and how their children never came to say hello or good-bye and were always seated at a 'children's table'.... definitely made me think about it....<br /><br />Hopefully you will enjoy it as much as I did, and put some of it to good use.
B0076DCT2G|2.0|I've really enjoyed many DeMille books, but this one was a disappointment.  The protagonist is nothing but along for the ride for much of the book. Indeed, there is very little action until the very end or even very much detective work. I kept reading to see what was going to happen, but after a while I was pissed off. Life is short: Read something else...
B004SJ3BCI|3.0|Fun to play. Does get boring. Only play it when there is nothing else to do. My kids play it more then I do.
B0059XTV4Y|5.0|This story had me captured from the beginning. I am not a Madonna fan at all BUT she did this story justice.<br />We saw a side that no one has captured before, Wallis's point of view. A lot of people see her as \\"stealing the King from his thrown\\" but not many have considered what she had to give up and go through. I love how a modern day woman who is un-happy could find herself through the history of W & E. The music & acting are stunning.<br />I usually do not purchase movies but this one is going in my small collection.
B003QS9WIE|5.0|I love this movie.  It is very well done and is great at keeping you guessing throughout the duration.<br />Well done.
B0096PYUE2|1.0|it doesn't work well like the adobe flash player Be nice that the adobe flash player was available for the kindle
B001KVZ6ES|3.0|Movie is GREAT! Have watched it several times and it clearly is a masterpiece. I am only giving this item 3 stars though due to the lack of special features on the disk, It is presented like a poor quality dvd with no special features, menu sucks, cheap case and insert, etc. A shame really that they would treat a movie that way...
B009K45Y62|4.0|I liked the editing, however there are some defects, such as the box of discs, is very weak and gave me the impression that it is a bad product, wish it was like the Brazilian edition, which besides this box, comes the traditional case for the person choose where to place the disc!
B001KVZ6HK|4.0|Not going to add spoilers here, but once you watch this it will leave anyone who is a true fan saying to them selves &#34;Awesome movie.....but why this and why that and they shouldn't have done that and this is wrong, etc.&#34;
B002V092M4|5.0|I watched tehe movie twice. I read the movie plot on wikipedia. I read the book. Now I understand this great but also complex piece of art. The book is a tough read as it is an investigation, with a lot of dialogues, not much action, many today and past back and forward, however the story is a complicated one and I donot know if there would be a simpler way to tell it. A must read for spy novel lovers.

B00ABGEFWC|2.0|My 6 year old daughter plays this game quite a bit.  I bet she would give it more stars, but as a parent this game is kind of lacking.  Make sure you turn on parental control before handing over this game to your little one.  The in-app purchasing is designed to be simple.  Sometimes I think these game developers are intentionally trying to rack up your phone bill by making it too easy for kids to buy things.  The tutorials in the game lead you directly (multiple times) to make in-app purchases.  Kinda shameful to be honest.  I also notice that this game has a ton of notifications.  If my daughter plays it during the day I'll have about 10 notifications from this game.  It would appear that at least some remedial skills in reading would be required.<br /><br />Pros:<br />Kids that like LPS will like it.  It is cute and fluffy<br /><br />Cons:<br />In-app purchasing shamelessly leads youngsters to purchases so make sure parental control is enabled<br />Does require some reading skill<br />Lots of notifications so your notification bar will get cluttered

B00992CF6W|5.0|it works great on kindle fire I love it I just started to play the creeper kind of scares me but awesome.
B003GK22HA|1.0|I did not manage to get to the end of this book, I got bored way before. It is hard to feel any sympathy for the characters, especially Taita, the narrator. Too many qualities in a single person, there is nothing he cannot do and spends too much time explaining the customs of ancient Egypt to the readers of the 20th century.
B009NQKXYK|4.0|Frightening...awesome effects...one of the better new sci fi thrillers to hit the screen this year. I rated it four stars.

B001NLL8LA|5.0|Worth reading a second time. As thrilling as all Jack Reacher novels. I recommend reading all of Lee Childs books.
076115678X|1.0|I expected from the great reviews that this book would provide me with great insights and tips to improve my hair .  Well folks it did not.  I got the book a few weeks ago, read some pages and found it to be boring and not helpful.  To everyone out there this book is not going to give you a miracle recipe to your hair troubles:(

B004QPOVF0|5.0|As a huge AC DC fan, this CD is incredible.  I was fortunate enough to enjoy the show live on tour BLACK ICE.  This is a quality reproduction of the live concert, antics, show and performance of one of the greatest bands of all time.  If you ever wanted to see AC DC in concert, this CD &#34;Live at River Plate&#34; is a close second to the real thing.<br />At the concert, my dad really wanted to see the cartoon that started off the show.  I looked everywhere and couldnt find it.  It is included in its entirety on this CD.  It is humerous and entertaining in typical AC DC fashion.  I am enormously pleased with this addition to my AC DC collection.
B009FZHYKU|5.0|Love this show keeps me on the edge of my seat. I recommend this show to every one and the acting is awesome
B000FC2KL0|3.0|I must admit that I have not finished reading this book yet.  I am a big fan of the Chili Peppers but not rabid like tattoo on my ankle kind of fan.  I have most of their CDs but have not seen them in concert yet (not for lack of trying though).  I was intrigued about a short synopsis in which Kiedis speaks of his tendency to destroy his body with drugs and then seeking out the healthiest foods.  I purchase the book on my kindle to read as we were traveling across country.  I was hooked in the first chapter.  The following narrative about a life of freedom, excess in drugs and sex were riveting.  But I stalled a little over half way through.  It became tedious and really very similar to the antics of any addict except of course Kiedis is famous.  I am really hoping to return to the book over the Christmas break and wrap this up but this is the first time I have not read a book cover to cover in one sitting.  I will hopefully return to this review and update it with more stars.
B00867GJYK|5.0|Finding Nemo is one of those films that can completely change your outlook on film. If Toy Story was the pitch, then Finding Nemo is the home run! To say this film is the greatest of the Pixar library is an understatement. This film is one of greatest animation films of all time! Period.<br /><br />The story centers around Marlin (Albert Brooks), a clown fish who has tragically lost his wife and all his children but one, Nemo. We see this in the first 10 minutes which, let's be honest is pretty tough to watch. Not just for children either. However sad and horrific the scene may be, it is essential to the story. So we understand that Marlin, naturally is overly protective of the one thing left in his life, his son.<br /><br />We join Marlin on Nemo on Nemo's first day at school. He is very excited to go, and naturally he would be. However his father is very nervous letting his son out of his sight for the first time. While at school Marlin finds out they are going to the same area where he wife and children were killed. So he rushes to Nemo's \\"safety\\". When he gets there he see's Nemo being dared to go out to see and touch a boat. Marlin shouts at Nemo being overly harsh, seeing as Nemo wasn't actually going to do it. When Marlin turns his back, Nemo rushes to the boat to spite his father. As a kid would. Tragedy strikes when Nemo is kidnapped by divers. The rest of the film follows Marlin trying desperately to find his lost son.<br /><br />Where the movie shines most is the characters. Marlin and Nemo are perfect. Marlin being incredibly likable and sympathetic. And Nemo is a normal, innocent kid who never gets annoying, which plagues most films with a child lead. Along Marlins journey we come across Dory (Ellen DeGeneres) a lovable blue fish with short term memory loss. This could have been annoying but they manage to pull it off very well. Along Marlin and Dory's Journey we come across vegetarian sharks, hippie turtles and many other funny and memorable characters.<br /><br />We also get other characters in a fish tank that Nemo is put in by the kidnappers. The greatest of which is Gill(Willem Dafoe). He is a fish from the ocean who has many scars due to his failed attempt at escape. There are other characters who are very likable and very, very funny. I won't spoil the rest of it for those who haven't seen it. The score, by Thomas Newman, is beautiful. There are no catchy tunes just music that creates atmosphere and a somber feel. The film is driven along by an understated soundtrack that never over shadows the perfect script.<br /><br />For a film mainly aimed at children, this film is essential for adults, especially those with children. The perfect Screenplay never feels false to preachy. People may take a different message from it, which most great films should do. The film features the most stunning animation i have ever seen. Bright colors and a crystal clear picture, which makes you want to get as close to the screen as possible to emerge yourself in this beautiful ocean world. It looks even better on Blu-Ray. If there was a film to show the Blu-Ray cynics, this is it. With perfect picture quality and great sound. This is definitely a must-buy!<br /><br />P.S The Blu-Ray discs are region free however the DVD is restricted to Region 1.
1451695195|4.0|Good reading, bought two copies for presents.<br />Would take a lot of the fear of dying away for many people as they age.<br />He came across as 100% genuine
145210655X|5.0|I bought this as a gift for a friend, but I couldn't resist flipping through it myself. The jokes are great for a parent, or really anyone with young kids in their life, who likes Star Wars. Definitely recommend.

0393338827|4.0|The Big Short takes the reader on a fantastic ride inside the most recent, and many would say ongoing, financial crisis. Lewis introduces us to people who bet against the subprime mortgage market, in all its variations, and in doing so became unimaginably wealthy. They are presented as a few select heroes pitted against the corrupt and often stupid villains of Wall Street insiders and their legion of minions. Has anything really changed since then?<br /><br />If Dr. Evil ever resurfaces in another installment of Austin Powers, puts his little finger to his mouth and makes a ransom demand for anything less than, \\"one gazillion dollars,\\" it will seem preposterous and, once again, a cue for all to laugh.<br /><br />The shock and awe of billions or even trillions of dollars are past us. They are now just strings of meaningless zeros heading off into the vastness of infinity. Take for example the capitalized notional value of derivatives--pegged at 1.2 quadrillion dollars (December 2012). Really?<br /><br />That's the equivalent of 20 years worth of economic activity for the entire planet. And derivatives are only one asset class expecting a return on investment (ROI). When others classes, such as stocks, (traditional) bonds, money market instruments, real estate holdings, etcetera, are added to the mix, financial expectations, going forward, become even more unrealistic and ridiculous.<br /><br />Due to a system of circular collateralization, debt, money and other financial assets essentially get boiled down to the same thing--mental constructs of value. The assigned values are now stratospheric. At best, they are delusional, dishonest and corrupt, and at worst, dangerously catastrophic.<br /><br />It's not the values in and of themselves that represent a threat; it's the global financial system--and everyone in it expecting some sort of benefit, return or payback. Interest on global debt (estimated at $100 trillion), along with the expected ROI on other assets, requires continuous growth and a level of physical activity that's beyond the productive capacity of a finite planet to produce it.<br /><br />The level of physical activity being undertaken to meet the demands of the global financial system is literally killing off the natural capital that's required to sustain human life. The ongoing financial crisis is not about strengthening banking regulations, reeling in reckless spending, evoking austerity measures or even curtailing greed, it's how to deal with the consequences of a global capitalistic system that will ultimately fail. And along with that managing the psychotic state of human collective consciousness arising out of our committed efforts to try and save a doomed system.<br /><br />For now, it seems, nearly everyone continues to be bullish on capitalism. Those with a desire to become gazillionaires are shorting natural capital markets and are betting that an ecological and social collapse can be avoided. Inherently, and by extension, they have deliberately and without shame or guilt shorted the rest of us too.<br /><br />And yet, who's effing who here? Each time we climb into the hamster wheel and begin to run, aren't we also willingly putting everything at risk?<br /><br />Most of what you've just read doesn't show up directly in The Big Short--rather it's been inspired by it. The story does tell of a select few who saw things differently and had the courage to act. I've taken a short position on capitalism. Crazy! Read The Big Short: Inside the Doomsday Machine and then judge.
B000P0J09C|4.0|Full Metal Jacket is a great war movie but the movie is divided into part one the boys getting trained by the drill sargent, second being the war.  I was very into the movie in the first half because of all the one liners from the drill sargent thanks to the script, but then seem the rest of the movie went on longer then should have because of some of the scenes and humor lines within the war scenes.  I am not taking that away from the movie I still give it a 4 star rating because I enjoy it most of the way threw the movie.  Though if you love a great war movie with mutiple great one liners worth repeating over and over again then buy this movie and add it to your collection, plus it is a movie on the 100 greatest movies of all time list which I totally agree with it being on that list.  But like some people say I don't agree it's \\"the best war movie ever made.\\"  If you have yet to watch it least once in your life buy it and enjoy the movie all the way threw because it has lots to offer fans of war movies.

B004TI5N38|4.0|I was casting about for a new book and author to try out and came across Balcacci's Zero Day.  Side note but related to this: I've been a big fan of Lee Child's Jack Reacher series (and have admittedly gone a bit 'sour' with Tom Cruise playing him in upcoming movie).  Baldacci's John Puller comes across as a Jack Reacher type who seems to have much of the same persona and character.  Puller is also Army but still active and in CID, (Reacher was Military Cop).  I won't go into the specifics of the story line suffice it the book has a good plot and it's well woven with solid and interesting character development of the others in the story.  I found it a very good and enjoyable read, one that keeps you page turning to see what comes next.  I'm hoping that Baldacci keeps pumping out the Puller books, and I see that he's got another one called The Forgotten that's going to be on my next to read list.  Who knows, Puller may replace Reacher as my \\"favorite\\" good guy with an attitude....
B004P7O4QK|2.0|The cd only has 11 songs which is less than half of which were on the show. The cd should be a complete reporduction of the show

B005HSG3VK|5.0|I really had a hard time looking and finding a good case for my new KF. I was primarily looking for something that wouldn't add more to the weight of the Kindle and would be durable. I've had this case for 2 weeks already and still looks in good conditions seeing how sometimes I just throw my KF in my purse. It's very light (in weight), it stands perfectly on the flap, it's made of this rubbery material which seem very durable! I haven't had an incident of dropping my KF yet (thankfully) but looks like it would protect it. I got mines in pink and the color is very true to the picture shown (hot pink). I also love the elastic that can be used to keep your kindle closed. I read that it was not good because it was just glued on but mine is still very much intact. Yes, it's a little bit pricey but I think it's worth your money, if you're looking for a simple case that won't add bulk or weight to your KF. I would definitely buy another one again!
B0054JZC6E|4.0|its good to pass class time when you have everything done. makes things a challenge but each game only has so much fun.
B005NJU8PA|5.0|Its more than just a cooking book. You will find many interesting skills that you can learn. Great present for holidays!!
B007Q0OV6Q|5.0|My son loves the anticipation of each day's surprise.  Very good choice for the holidays.  Legos hit a home run again this year!
B005GSZZ1A|4.0|I chose this book because I love historical fiction but this one is biographical.  I learned a lot about North Korea and was shocked that these things still go on in the world.  Don't people evolve in these countries?  I found it very interesting and easy to read.  If you want to know what is going on in other parts of the world, this is one book to read.  It will open your eyes.
B0054JZC6E|3.0|its fine I guess, I don't really care at all. I'm just doing this for the 250,000 that I'm getting in the game. I just need a few more words and ill be done. omg why is it taking so many letters?!  this is a waste of time.
B000YHG72E|4.0|My daughter was home sick from school and getting incredibly bored with tv, games, etc.  Decided to pick a holiday movie that we could watch together.  She picked Elf.  I've seen it before and enjoy Will Ferrel's character, but it was much more fun seeing my daughter react to it!<br />Not sure if it was the movie or my wireless dvd player, but about 3/4 of the way through, it stopped.  I was able to get it going again, but not until I backed completely out of the movie and then resumed playing it.  Guessing it was my machine though!
B004JK61K0|5.0|Product works well. Had no difficulty setting up. Takes a bit of sorting to figure out which mail came from yahoo or gmail. But not too hard
B00168HARG|5.0|Nothing to say - new in box as expected. words words words words words words words words words words word.
B009GIPDQS|4.0|Grisham has once again proved he is an authority on legal thrillers with this classy fiction. The book is unbeleivably gripping and addictive. Reminded me of his earlier masterpeice &#34;The Broker&#34;. If you are looking for an intelligent thriller, make this your choice for the season. Totally worth the time !!
B0017XD3OY|4.0|It is a really interesting movie because of all the action.  The reason I gave it a 4 instead of a 5 is because of the ending, which is sad.  I really thought it was interesting when Will Smith shot at a store dummy which he had set up and which he talked to<br />all the time.  It was interesting how he  rigged his house with traps to keep out the zombies.
B007IXWL2C|2.0|It was the same as the other two books!!! it became borring. I couldn´t even finish it!!!<br />It needs more stories from the other characters.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|One of the best book series ever. Great book for all ages and both genders. I have read it, my husband and our 13 year old son.
B005LAIIPS|4.0|Really good follow-up to the Mat Damon series.  The movie has an exciting plot that works well as a follow-up to the original Jason Bourne series.
B00AMBK0X4|4.0|It had a decent story line and some real funny parts.  I liked it enough to give it four stars because it at<br />least had a different story line to it.  I like family guy humor and I liked this movie.  I want to see the rated<br />R one just to see what the difference was.
B009HELT3C|4.0|This is certainly one of the best MIB  movies I have seen.  It certainly is better than the second movie (which I liked) and is as good or better than the first MIB.  Good Fun!
B002O5M4SA|5.0|I enjoyed this film in 1994. I have the uncut on DVD and decided to get this one on bluray at a cheaper cost and with uncut scenes.<br />Gary oldman is my favorite character in this movie. Entertaining dialogue, humor, and dangerous. I laugh often when I see this film. XD<br />The picture quality on bluray 1080p is dramatically excellent than a DVD.<br /><br />I couldn't ask for more on this high quality bluray disc. Of course with today's society, we all have cell phones and computers opposed to the past relying on newspapers, tv, and beepers/pagers.
B00A3NQNUU|5.0|I love raising dragons and building their habitiats.  It's really a lot of fun, but I wish the dragons didn't cost so much.
B000SEGUDE|4.0|The plot(s) starts off slow sometimes to the point of boredom, but eventually grabs your attention. However, the writing style and prose make it a great read all by itself.
0802136834|4.0|I found this a thorough and accurate read of the women who shared the life of Henry the Eigth. I like the way Alison Weir paints a picture with facts rather than emotionalism. It did put in perspective each wives character and role in his life. Enjoyable read.

B009VL28W2|5.0|This tour has garnered quite a few live releases, and I have seem them all from Nimes, to Mexico to Sophia and on.  I do not detract stars based on set lists, I simply review the product itself, set list is really a matter of opinion.  Now down to the bolts:  Great picture, viewed on a LG LED 55 inch tv via PS3 and it was amazing, the 5.1 DTS-HD sound was fantastic.  I didn't really find the cam views a distraction, nor do I think it was frantic or manic.  I've seen frantic filming and I didn't feel this concert had that, there are switches but they aren't anything that detracted from my viewing personally.  AC/DC's River release had far faster changes and took some getting used to, but I still didn't feel it detracted from the experience, but again, this is really a personal preference, you'll have to watch to see if it's an issue for you (which you can view on MetallicaTV on youtube, full songs from this release)before purchasing.  The extra songs included were a great addition, all of these tracks were voted on by the fans and the inclusion of Shortest Straw is just something of a bear hug, one of my favorites.  I also thought their older stuff sounded great, not as slow and chugging as some of their previous performances, I thought they were fast and furious in this show.  I would recommend the show to anyone who loved Death Magnetic, these songs shine live.  I couldn't find any reason to subtract stars based on the product, the packaging and everything was fine, the price was quite reasonable.  Overall 5 stars.
B004UHSB5A|5.0|This is a good game and I and my husband like playing it.  It is difficult to get it to stick to the tiles once in awhile, but I guess I just need to work it better.
B009SQRL4U|4.0|My son really enjoyed this show.  It had a nice message to it, which as a parent I really appreciated.<br />It's worth a watch.
B007FEFLTO|5.0|Well ... I resisted buying this because the Kindle price was essentially the same as the Hardbound. Seemed unfair (the Hardbound has value for resale, I would have it 20 years from now, I can give it to friends, and so forth). But Book one was so compelling that I broke down and bought the Kindle version of Winter of the World. I'm still irritated about the price, but not sorry. It's a great read, completely engaging, just a pleasure to curl up with in the evening.
B009GEBBNQ|4.0|The Avengers is a great action movie based on favorite comic book heroes. Amazon instant video is a great way to watch, easy delivery via the Internet, low cost, great quality. We watched using Amazon App on a Roku unit on a HD TV.<br />Cheers, Bill
B009FZFONO|4.0|I love this series... it is and isn't just like the books....  but it's an emotional wild ride that makes my wife and I constantly imagine.. what if?
B001G7HKZ4|4.0|Sometimes it's nice to slip out of our world into a funny romantic place. Loved the transformation and the quick thinknig.
0375842209|4.0|Hitler is slowly rising to power and Liesel is having to grow up. As a German, if you weren't for Hitler you were a threat. First her father disappears. Next her mother is chronically ill and finds she can't afford to take care of herself or her children--Liesel and her brother. Liesel's mother arranges with an agency for her children to be put in foster care. Then her brother doesn't make it--he dies on the train en route.<br /><br />Leisel is still placed with the Hubermans. While in there care, she learns about war time, injustice, and how different people deal with tragedy.<br /><br />Since it is told from the perspective of death through the eyes of a poor, young, non-Nazi, it definitely sheds a different light on that time period. The writing style seemed disjointed and didn't capture my interest until about half-way through; though Zusak does paint some unique word picture. Still, The Book Thief was well worth my time and I would recommend it to young adults and up.
B002ZG975Q|5.0|But if you like the story of Beauty and the Beast and don't mind that it is a little weak in some ways it is a wonderful movie.
0061743526|5.0|For many this book is among required reading usually in high school. Somehow I had avoided reading it until it was highly recommended by my book club.<br />Once I started I couldn't put it down. I finished in about a week. The style is similar to Huck Finn, but with a female protagonist.<br /><br />Scout is growing up in the South, when blacks aren't really slaves anymore but are still segregated. Some people, like her father, consider blacks as human and equal. Others still view them as separate and unequal.<br /><br />Since Scout's mother died, her father allows her to figure out life in her own way--traipsing around in overalls, instead of dresses, with her brother Jem. Aunt Alexandra wants to teach Scout to be a lady, but to do so goes against Scout's dad's philosophy of life.<br /><br />In some ways, Harper Lee expresses some rather forward thinking. However some parents may not want their children reading about rape, though I think it was dealt with tactfully.
B00AQ3K8IU|5.0|Is it possible to top perfection?<br /><br />Anyone that knows me knows I LOVE the Slammed series by Colleen Hoover with all my heart. To me that book was perfection and I really didn't think that Colleen would be able to top it.  And she didn't top it. No, she double-decker ice cream scoop, hot fudge sauce, whipped cream, and sprinkles topped it.<br /><br />I am once again amazed at Colleen's ability to bring her characters to life and how they can so easily get under my skin. Sky is strong, brave, but yet a broken young woman.  There are many points in the story that have you wondering why something that would bother or embarrass anyone else simply doesn't faze her at all. The reality is that I love that about her.  I envy her ability to take life so nonchalantly. I don't, however, envy all that she had to go through and wouldn't wish that on my worst enemy. My heart broke for her in many places and I'm still not sure if it is completely put back together.<br /><br />Holder is....well, Holder is scary. He's scary because he is so damn perfect. Not perfect in a flawless sort of way, because he definitely has his flaws, but perfect in a way that makes you feel protected, in a way that makes you feel secure, and perfect in a way that oozes swoon-worthy masculinity and makes your heart pitter-patter with everything that comes from his mouth.  There is no poetry in Hopeless, but Holder's words felt like poetry to me.<br /><br />Before delving into this book, I didn't read the synopsis and I didn't read any teasers.  I simply put my faith in Colleen that she would write something that would blow me away.  And she didn't disappoint. So in this review I am not going to give anything about the story away.  I simply challenge you to pick it up and start reading.  Your decision to do so will be validated with the emotions your heart feels throughout the book.<br /><br />Hopeless is a book that will make you laugh, make you cry, rip out your heart, shatter it in little tiny pieces, stomp on it a little, and then duct tape it all back together. It's not simply a love story, it's a journey that will change you forever.  I am forever changed because of this book.<br /><br />If you have a heartbeat and a soul, you should read this book.  Heck, even if you're a zombie, you should read this book.  You will LIKE it.  You will LIVE it.  You will LOVE it.<br /><br />Please note: Hopeless is in no way related to Colleen Hoover's Slammed series.  And although the characters are in high school, the subject matter is darker and more geared toward an audience 17 and above.
B000W93CHC|4.0|Not as good as Pillars of the Earth, but still a good read.  Predictable at times. I ready to re-read it!
B0076DELIG|3.0|The Black Box is the first Michael Connelly novel or short story which does not meet the previous standards.  The police procedures are good, but the story line seems to be a secondary thought to carry the procedures. Getting al little soap operaish, with the interaction with his daughter.  Is it some kind of guilt????

6305922756|3.0|The movie is a cult classic, but there is something wrong with the disc. It will play normally and then all of the sudden mess up for a bit.
B009D7CP2M|5.0|The gripping international bestseller about motherhood gone awry<br /><br />Eva never really wanted to be a mother - and certainly not the mother of the unlovable boy who murdered seven of his fellow high school students, a cafeteria worker, and a much-adored teacher who tried to befriend him, all two days before his sixteenth birthday. Now, two years later, it is time for her to come to terms with marriage, career, family, parenthood, and Kevin's horrific rampage in a series of startlingly direct correspondences with her estranged husband, Franklin. Uneasy with the sacrifices and social demotion of motherhood from the start, Eva fears that her alarming dislike for her own son may be responsible for driving him so nihilistically off the rails.
B00AMBM9MO|3.0|it was alright, had a few really funny parts but wasn't as advertised &#34;as the funniest movie of all time&#34;
B000A6T1JU|5.0|Love it.  Shipped quick.  One of the best all time movies. ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha
B009VB7QQA|4.0|I really enjoyed it, my gf and I watched it one night with very low expectations but were very pleasantly surprised!
B009LXEBD4|5.0|For someone who seldom buys CDs anymore, this manage to keep my attention throughout.  It is an enjoyable mix of songs.
B005LAJ1HW|5.0|Great set at a great price! I love the show. I can't wait to receive the third season boxed set when it comes out.
B0076DELIG|5.0|Typical great story from Michael Connelly, kept me engaged the whole time....keep those Harry Bosch novels coming!<br />Hope the next one is on its way!
B0055SWM08|5.0|This is a very beautiful puzzle game with such lovely background music. The puzzles aren't terribly challenging; they consist of collecting pearls by moving a drop of water around obstacles. Enough challenge to work your brain, but not so much that your eyes squint.
B00AE2IJIE|4.0|First mistake: didn't order hi-def, you most certainly must use it if it's available.<br />Primary reason I ordered it was Kodi Smitt McFee even if it was just his voice. Secondary reason, sounded  like a novel storyline barring' 'The 6th Sense' premise.<br />After watching it and only then did I read it was stop motion. Shame is with standard def. and looking for more I never noticed. Plain and simple for general consumption it was ok but I just didn't care, not about the characters, not about the plot, and most certainly not about the stop motion.<br />---------------------------------<br />Note Added 4/21/13: I just re-watched Norman again, this time in hi-def on NF and indeed there is more to see when viewing that way. The facial expressions; I couldn't believe how expressive they were and he was. This movie truly does have heart and I did care about him the second time around even his little butterball friend that stuck by him and his wise mouthed sister who finally<br />realized, though weird at times he was still her brother and it was her job to look after him.<br />Do forgive my first impression, it definitely may not be a classic but it most certainly is a small gem worth viewing at least once...<br />and maybe even twice if your heart was closed first viewing.
B007UXSPK2|4.0|This movie was full of action, as anticipated.  The cinematography in several of the scenes was worth the wait from the other three in the series.  A movie well done.
B005NJU8PA|5.0|I bought this book to 9 of my friends, due to all the good tips on learning. But it´s also funny and mind-broadening, and lastly, but none the least: an excellent cook book!
B0096CDG0O|2.0|Dice With Buddies<br />Takes too long to play.  Don't like having to wait for other person to play. I am sorry that I ordered it now.
B0076DELIG|3.0|I feel like Harry Bosch is an old friend because I've read so many of Connelly's books but this one didn't seem to get anywhere until at least 3 quarters through it and by that time I just couldn't wait to get it over with!  It dragged in the middle and by the ending  I really didn't care anymore!
B005XN31LY|5.0|Fantastic series with a wild twist on the fairy tale world.  Even my children are addicted:)  Characters are very interesting and will draw you in
B000FC1AGG|5.0|This story is hilarious!! I kept laughing out loud every time he tease her with her own secrets. The main character is very relatable!
B005LAII62|5.0|I highly recommend this movie.  It was very cute and my daughter loved it!  A must see for any tween.
B005LAJ17M|5.0|I have dealt with folks who struggle with bipolar disorders and Claire Danes (you might remember her from My So Called Life) plays that role as a bipolar CIA agent to a tee. She is so good, that it is downright scary. I just finished watching the 2nd season yesterday and I can attest to the fact that this won't be a show you will get sick of. It gets better!!!<br /><br />The plot of the show is indeed quite frightening to even think about. But that is what makes it such an intriguing show. Is Brody a war hero or a terrorist? Well... watch and find out!!!
B009IJJ5B4|5.0|This episode keeps the deductive reasoning phenomenal without over-reaching.  Slow trust and relationship building between Holmes and Watson continues. When are criminals going to realize that it is so easy to tell if someone was killed somewhere else and then dumped?
B0060MYM7O|5.0|The show blows my mind and it only gets better. It is hard to match season 1's shocking finale, but the writers of the show were clearly up to the task. Though my wife loves it, it is worth mentioning that males might be more inclined to like it with the violence and barbaric behavior.
B008MG1E4A|5.0|Great book! I couldn't put it down! Gives all of us a small glimpse of the training out soldiers go through to fight for us every day
1419702238|5.0|love the books keeps my grandaughter entertained, and out of my hair i hate to write don't like reviews like this
B008F9E306|5.0|Flat out one of the best album from the King. It emphasizes very specifically on being a trouble man. T.I. is the new old school for real.
B004I8WD6E|4.0|The assembly was easy and it has been a good case.  I like the feel and look of it.  But as others have said, the screen protector smears easily and you just can't carry around the cloth all the time.
B004QZ9PLU|5.0|It was as usual a heart warming book by Sparks. It hit the heart strings as deep as possible! Definitely a book I will read again
B004GVUPFE|4.0|interesting, like playing ,a bit of a challenge played it just a bit but intend to play more as time permits
B000SW2F80|5.0|Fun to watch late at night, or early in the morning just as long as it is dark outside. Makes it more creepy!
B005IQ39AY|4.0|fun game need to make sure not to tap while moving the direction of the bubble it is interesting trying to beat your own score
B005NJU8PA|5.0|Best book on learning yet.  I especially like the examples, and how he used cooking as the platform to teach about learning.
B005COO1X6|3.0|Mile 81<br />Pretty simple plot which doesn't really go anywhere. Okay read for airplane or bus, but read yourself to judge.
B0002O06N0|5.0|By far my favorite Black Keys cd. This was done very well. Guitar work and drums are excellant again. I suggest buying this to get a good idea of Black Keys
B00A6PD9I4|5.0|The movie was good and we enjoyed it with our grandsons. The price was much better than paying on demand with Brighthouse.
B0013K6WLM|5.0|I really have gotten into the Black Keys within the last few months. energetic!!! This cd is very good. Reminds me of some 60s music.
1579129129|5.0|This is a wonderful book - purchased for my daughter who is a naturalist and LOVES her skull collection. It's a Christmas gift which she does not have yet - but I know she'll love the book.
B0086700CM|4.0|This is a fun fast action game to play for all ages.  I would recommend it AND it was free.
B004LZEV4Q|5.0|This is a wonderful book that I read to  and with my grandson...He hasn't received it what because it is his xmas gift.  I hope he loves it I thinki he will.It was easy to set up the reading of the pages and recording was fun!
B0044XV3R8|5.0|good good good<br />yayaya awesome good job everything was good and shipped on time. yes yes i need one more word sweet okay done
B003Y059EK|1.0|This movie was completely different from &#34;The Wizard of Oz&#34;. I would NOT recommend it. I am sorry I rented.
B002ZG977Y|5.0|good good good good good everything was good no damage good good came in on time good good good good. yeah
B003EY7IRC|5.0|I have read all the MacKayla Lane books so far and Iced is next.  Every one of her books is fantastic and good from start to finish.  I enjoyed reading this book as much as I enjoyed reading the first.  In one word &#34;EXCELLENT&#34;.
B009FZHYKU|1.0|Not able to view this on Amazons website. States  Adobe Flash not installed. Guess what it is installed. Do not have any problems watching videos at Netflix or Google Play!!!
B0076DELIG|5.0|I've read every Harry Bosch book that Michael Connelly has written and this one ranks right up there with the best. Connellly has a way to engulf the reader in personal details that seem relevant to the crime details and put the reader in Harry's shoes. I'm retired Army and served in Viet Nam so many of the post-war anecdotes that Harry relates to are ones that I have lived myself. Just finished The Black Box and as always am looking forward to the next episode.
B000XUBFE2|5.0|Many books have been written about the holocaust but this one brings home with such clarity how cruel and how compassionate humans are capable of being. I personally have never read a book quite like The Book Thief. I have recommended it to our book club.
B00AMBLXP8|4.0|The movie plays with your emotions but overall its a comedy. I had a hard time at first separating Ted from Peter from family guy since Seth plays his voice but as the film went on I got over it. That is the only reason for the four star rating otherwise great movie it wasn't all given away in the trailers like most movies are.
B007H7XJD4|4.0|Immortals is exactly what you would think it is. A sweet action movie with decent acting and a tense plot line. If you like movies like &#34;300&#34; or &#34;Troy&#34; you will like this movie.
B009XY97VC|4.0|Great music, a couple of the songs aren't my favorites but that's going to happen with any cd, just personal taste.<br />It is, however, quite a bit different from the music I normally see from Two Steps From Hell. There is a lighter, more kindly outlook to the music, and the entire album seems to be telling a story of some sort.<br />It is still very much Two Steps From Hell though, the composition is beautiful.<br />This is the first time I have bought an entire album from them, usually I just buy my favorite tracks, and I am very glad I decided to get the whole thing.
B0076DCT2G|5.0|The Panther.  Nelson DeMille is my favorite author, The Panther is another of his John Corey stories.  Enjoying it tremendously.

B0094BB4TW|1.0|it only gives me the last 10 updates! i don't like that at all! Other than that it's  good but scrolling thru status is what FB is all about!
B008AK8FHM|2.0|I thought the author was more intrested in telling his readers how great he is,,,much too much ego and not really as advertised. Proof of Heaven
0316227706|5.0|Beautiful book.  I bought the grandkids this book for Christmas.  I am sure they will enjoy it as much as we did.
0199571120|5.0|Yes we have dictionaries on our iPads and Kindles, but there is something about the ability to look in this huge book and find a word.  Maybe the sheer size of it is what is so fascinating.  I researched dictionaries and this one came out on top.  I understand why.
B009FZHYKU|5.0|Since 1967 I have followed only a few TV series, so far I can count them two hands with room for a couple more. I have been a zombie movie fan since &#34;Night of the Living Dead&#34;. I love &#34;B&#34; zombie movies if they are really bad and I am always on the hunt for &#34;A&#34;'s. This series is very enjoyable in that the characters are believable, the story is going somewhere and it is well written.<br />It is not a gore fest or constantly running at high speed, however when there is gore it is believable without being over done and  the pace can pickup in an instant. Don't fall in love with any characters because you do not know who is next. I learned early on in the series, that a character may seem to a key component in the building of the story and then suddenly in the middle of some character interaction with where the story seems to going......
B0034G4P8A|5.0|I love Thor and I was able to pick this movie up on a holiday special after Thanksgiving and a great price.  Thanks Amazon!!
0761169253|5.0|I read this book one Sunday afternoon while hanging out at the local cafe. What an encouraging and inspiring read. I loved it and hope to meet the author someday, since he's in Austin where I live. I carry this book with me in my purse and it never fails to lift my spirits.
B004LWZWGK|5.0|Love the DVD combo sets, they are great for watching the movies on older player, new Blue-ray, and portable electronic and the computer.  Great deal!
B001NHNG64|3.0|I've read 2 other Reacher books in the past so this is not my first time reading a Child/Reacher book.  I found myself skimming huge chunks of the book as characters were walking around in the woods.  Also found some of the situations preposterous.  This hostage that is so important that they went through incredible effort to get to her to the camp is left alone in a room without a guard or a camera and this other massive hulk of a guy who has shown himself skilled enough to escape and kill other members of your team is routinely left under minimal guard so that he can engineer multiple escapes.  Wanted to like it more than I did.
B005IZLPMY|5.0|I love Captain America and I was able to pick this movie up on a holiday special after Thanksgiving and a great price.  Thanks Amazon!!
B0074D3CAQ|5.0|This book was awesome.  It makes you think about your own personal relationships and maybe re-think things that you can do to improve them.
B004EPYZQ2|5.0|I love Super 8 and I was able to pick this movie up on a holiday special after Thanksgiving and a great price.  Thanks Amazon!!
B00499K9E0|5.0|I am re-watching the series, and \\"A Study in Pink\\" is the beginning of this re-worked, modernized Sherlock Holmes. For example. the way the show included present-day touches, such as displaying text messages onscreen for the audience to see is genius.<br /><br />First time around, I was enthralled with Benedict Cumberbatch as Sherlock Holmes, all pale and cheekbones, and this time watching I am absolutely in love with Martin Freeman's Dr. John Holmes.<br />I focused on his nuanced expressions and his mannerisms and think he is so amazing in this role.<br />The two of them together is British cleverness at its best.<br /><br />Cheers!
B0076DELIG|5.0|Harry is one of my favourite characters in the police procedural.  I like the way Michael Connelly portrays a police department and the politics that happen within the department.  Harry is real to me even though I know that this is fiction writing.  I also like the realistic relationship Harry has with his daughter.  Harry certainly has his flaws, but I can live them.  The plot in the story is thought out and keeps you turning the pages.  I really enjoyed The Black Box
B009IEXKXI|5.0|A definite winner here, the raw and unfiltered main character, astronaut Mark Watney, guides you through his survival story, via log entries, on the surface of Mars.  Interspersed throughout problem-solving, technical and scientific jargon is the character's interesting takes on the situation at hand, and we get to see what goes through his mind during critical situations.  An unlikely, but nonetheless enjoyable, sequence of events takes the reader along on a journey with Mark, who impresses with his knowledge as well as his humor.  Having the ability to connect with this likable character really made this a page turner.  Well done, Mr. Weir!
B007GCY8FS|4.0|I really like the author Lee Child and his character Jack Reacher.  This story takes many twists and turns as Jack hitches a ride with two men and a woman.  Jack is a tough character and sometimes I wish he wasn't so tough.  Reacher does have a softer side, but he doesn't show it very often.
B00AHSMDQY|5.0|the movie ties together and wraps up (sort of) the triolgy nicely. good action, great story, very well delivered by the actors.
B0009FU0ZQ|5.0|I really enjoy the Jesse Stone series starring Tom Selleck. I have the whole series and have enjoyed the character development. My only complaint is that there is little action and a lot of whispy music between little dialogue. In great measure, that is intentional because that enhances the same feeling about the Jesse Stone character.<br /><br />I recommend the whole series and can't wait for more. But, don't expect new releases to come along quickly, Selleck has other irons in the fire, and these are low-budget project films.
B00AL3KEE8|5.0|Quentin Tarantino is the master when it comes to using music in movies.  No matter what the situation, the music always perfectly captures the emotion that you are seeing on screen.  \\"Django Unchained\\" is one of the most interesting and diverse movie soundtracks to be released in a long time.  I highly recommend it (along with all of Tarantino's other soundtracks - check out \\"Jackie Brown\\" and \\"Inglourious Basterds\\" if you haven't done so already).<br /><br />There are a lot of great songs on this album - a few newly produced for the film, but most are older songs.  My two personal favorites are \\"Who Did That to You?\\" by John Legend and \\"100 Black Coffins\\" by Rick Ross.  But every song on this album is memorable.<br /><br />Instead of using an original score, Tarantino uses existing music from classic films.  Therefore, on this album you will find tracks from the great film composers Ennio Morricone and Jerry Goldsmith.  Among them, \\"Sister Sara's Theme\\" and \\"Un Monumento\\" are the best.  These cues have been taken from other westerns and have been re-purposed for use in Tarantino's film.<br /><br />Another unqiue touch is that this album includes some dialogue from the film... normally this would be useless on a soundtrack, but the writing in this film is so great and the actors deliver the lines in a way that almost make it sound musical.  So while listening to this album, every once in a while you'll hear a memorable quote from Jamie Foxx, Christoph Waltz, and Samuel L. Jackson, among others.<br /><br />**Note: iTunes seems to have an exclusive 24th track - \\"Ode to Django\\" by RZA.

B00005JMFQ|1.0|I'm sorry, did someone say this is a Christmas movie?  Actually, that's how this movie is billed ~ a Christmas movie.  Not only that, it's apparently so popular with a certain segment of our society that it's considered the most awesome Christmas movie!  Wow.  Words almost escape me.<br /><br />I'll give you that this movie has some great actors, actors that I really like.  That's why I saw it when it first came out.  I sat through the whole thing waiting for something to happen to redeem it.  Didn't happen.<br /><br />Not only does this movie have absolutely nothing to do with Christmas (other than apparently the ending of the movie takes place on Christmas day), but really, all it has to do with is shallow people looking for love or more accurately stated, sex.  That's right, sex.  This movie illustrates perfectly the average person's massive confusion between LOVE and LUST.  I found the movie pretty sad, pathetic really.  But it makes it all the worse to call this sorry movie a \\"Christmas\\" movie.  Good grief.

0307596885|5.0|I can't believe it, but I finally read an Alice Munro story collection.  I'm not sure what took me so long, but now I've done it, and I understand all the hype.  Munro has a way of capturing a mood or emotional state in just a few brief words.  Her characters are normal people, but she tells the stories so as to reveal the deeper meanings and struggles in everyday lives.  I was particularly surprised by how many of these stories feel like epics.  They cover decades of time in just a few pages without feeling rushed or compressed.  For the most part, Munro focuses on routine events and quiet moments.  The drama is understated, and the subtleties are beautiful.<br /><br />Like most story collections, some of the stories here really captured my attention while others were less affecting.  Overall, however, this collection is very strong.  The first story in the collection, To Reach Japan, is still haunting me, and I read that one about a month ago.  I've since read it again.  All parents of young children should read this story...it truly captures the tension we all feel between living our own lives and living our lives as parents.  Other favorites from this collection include Corrie, Train, and Night.  The final four stories are described by Munro as more autobiographical than anything she's published before, so long-time Munro fans won't want to miss those.
B00633W614|4.0|I personally like Jeffrey Archer, not because he is such a great author, but because his works are always very easy to read, interesting to try to figure its twist a nd turns and they always have a suprising ending. As does the ending of this work. Leads to discussion and many various personal endings. Book club likes it as an light reading.....Joan Smith
B0081L37Z0|5.0|LMAO, These two are great together, and the camios in it are perfect.. make sure the kids arent watching... yes its that funny
B0073LWEXK|4.0|This is a great game but not long enough, I feel like there could be more areas to explore on it.
B004SJ3AXI|5.0|My kids and I love this game,,, keeps us occupied while waiting, and so many levels to finish. Fun game
B0098VXMNE|1.0|If you are a psychopath that enjoys blood, torture, flying body parts and the most crude, sub-mammalian depictions of sexuality I've ever seen, this is your show. Especially if you don't care that the writing sucks and the acting is worse. Characters that you don't give a damn about... it's all there. Perhaps the writers were trying to show just how unevolved we were as a species as recently as the Roman Empire. This is a complete waste of time. I could barely make it through a single episode. I want my time and my money back! I guess Starz is far behind HBO, Shotime, and AMC in producing quality programming.
B006OCM0G0|1.0|I guess Im just not a cook game kinda person, too much work, and I wanna play challenging games, not mindless waste of time games
B003GYEGNO|5.0|Great characterization and, as a native NY-er, accurate portrayal of times- still true today! Would make a great movie.... anyone?
B008JGSM6G|5.0|we all play this on my phone and kindle.. from our 8 year old- to the adults..we see how many levels we all pass..
B007MJ9LA2|4.0|If you're a fan you'll really enjoy this.  If you're not, I wouldn't bother.  If you're &#34;Santana curious&#34; there are better. more definitive options out there.
B0047Y0FGY|5.0|READ IT&#62;&#62;&#62;&#62; if you have the chance. It is a great story and a good laugh, Tina hits on alot of fun topics, and stories
B00AMBM9MO|4.0|Not a movie for people who have problems with \\"toilet\\" humor. It's written by Seth McFarlane, so you know what you're getting!
B004SRPXWQ|4.0|It's a very cute app but not something that I want to play with often but it's kind of fun to have to show the grand kids or to putter around with once in a great while. It does make me laugh.
B00A8ECU24|5.0|Very fun game. It's good if you're patient so you don't have to spend real money on the game.<br /> I recommend it for any brony or pegasister.
B008JGSM6G|3.0|It's too easy...I find it very boring. Good thing for an elementary kid to play with. My 3rd grade grand daughter likes it.
B000HKW7E0|5.0|I would urge anyone that for whatever reason has not seen this to immediately go watch it!  It will become a Christmastime viewing tradition for years to come!  I can’t think of a day regardless of the time of year that I don’t use a quote from this movie!  Love it!!!
B0086700CM|4.0|It is fast paced and fun but not a relaxing type game. I do not play this one very often.
B000W93CHC|5.0|I really enjoyed reading this book. Great sequal and I would love  to see movies of both books. I understand there is a movie of &#34;Pillars of the Earth&#34;.
B005XI9456|1.0|It stinks. Bieber takes a few good songs and makes them terrible.  Bieber may be a talented singer, but his producer did him absolutely no favors on this travesty of an album.
B00AMBLXP8|1.0|This flick was gross, disgusting and not funny; in fact, is was boring. If you are looking for genuine comedy, search elsewhere.
B008ZOHCKE|3.0|I think this is a good app. I like to write lots of things through out my day. However, the password/security does not work. I put in a password but it doesn't take it. Whenever I open the app it just takes me back to my last page, never asks for it. I'd give 5 stars if the password problem were fixed.
B004SD5GZ4|5.0|Adobe Reader is needed to open .pdf. files as Microsoft Office Word is needed to open .doc files. One can view, pint, or collaborate with their .pdf files. The program is user-friendly and easy to familiarize yourself with the command icons. The best thing about Adobe Reader is that it's offered free of charge, as opposed to Microsoft Word where you have to buy Microsoft Office. Adobe Reader is also a great alternative to sending documents. In other words, when I send documents to a recipient, I send both a .doc file and a .pdf file. If the recipient does not have Microsoft Word, they can view the file as a .pdf instead. This app will fulfill all of your document needs.
B007JM4CWY|5.0|I got this when it was free. This game is addictive and makes you think. It kills my battery but it's so worth it!
B008BTOVL6|5.0|I was a little concerned I would have to purchase a special player or a converter but this works great for me and I'm in the states. (Possibly my player downloaded the requisite information to play?)
B008AK8FHM|5.0|I have read many books on the subject of NDEs and all have offered unique views of what happens after death or near death.<br />Proof of Heaven shines an all together different experience from most with the explanation of the three realms, having no memory of &#34;self&#34; or loved ones on earth.<br />The book is seen from the scientific as well as the spiritual from someone who has true knowledge of both and the courage and compassion to tell the world his story.<br />It made me look at myself, others and the universe we live in with greater hope and awareness!
B006MW3V6U|5.0|This is an amazing series. The UK version has a lot of scenes that were cut out by PBS in America. It is Worth buying.
B00AMBK6J2|2.0|I was hoping this would be better than it was, I'm a big fan of Family Guy and raunchy comedies.  Ted attempted to be a raunchy comedy but it ended up being cheesy.
B0097NGUJG|4.0|While Pitchfork gave them a scathing review, they won the 2012 Mercury Prize, so the reception has clearly been mixed. While their lyrics leave something to be desired, the music itself is an interesting sound that has yet to get old after two months of heavy rotation. I'd recommend it.
B003XF1XOQ|4.0|Great ending to a great trilogy.Has an ending you don't see coming. Lots of action.Lots of twist and turns. Once I started reading couldn't stop until I finished .
B0066WJLU6|5.0|The flashlight works as expected and provides light in a pinch.  However, since it uses up battery I limit using it.
B0052RE4MQ|5.0|A great book to read after...or before Veronica Roth's Divergent Series.  I really connected with the characters.  I can't get enough of series books!
B007N8RULO|4.0|I like the function of spider solitaire for the most part.  However, the way it fits the kindle fire screen does not utilize the space well.  If they started closer to the top they could either increase the size of the cards or get more cards on a stack before they start bunching up.
B002NZTZ8S|5.0|My six year old grandson enjoys seeing it again and again.  It is a great Christmas movie.<br />Very true to the book.
B009FZFONO|5.0|I love this series so much and was afraid that I wouldn't be able to watch it due to me &#34;cutting the cord&#34; with Comcast a few months prior.  Although with a one day delay, Amazon delivered my episodes weekly.  Price was definitely reasonable considering I now own the episodes in HD.  HD streaming episodes were flawless and commercial free (huge plus!).  I do wish that Amazon offered the after show episodes, the Talking Dead...but other than that I look forward to watching the second half of the show when it airs in the spring.
B0063M22QO|5.0|Love this game.  So many levels and different layouts.  The whole family plays it.  Would highly recommend it!!  You won't be disappointed.
B00280LYIC|5.0|Great book. My 10 yr old loves this whole series. Great for AR points too Strong, moral characters are another strong point.
B0041D843M|5.0|I bought this book after watching the documentary Forks over Knives. I was very interested in this book because I knew it was a deeper look into why of eating a whole foods plant based diet. I was not disappointed. Dr. Campbell explains in an easy to understand manner. He also includes all of the research reference material so you can look it up for yourself. This book is very well written and a must read for anyone who wants to follow a whole foods plant based diet.
B0017SWPXY|5.0|A great book on many levels, this is an easy read that will make you think, will encourage and inspire you-- and appreciate your dog! (You'll also learn a little about professional auto racing)
B005RAO0GS|5.0|I must say i wasnt a fan of florence and the machine at first, but they have grown on me! this cd is really awesome and all the songs i can play over and over agian! This cd is a lot better than the cd \\"lungs\\" by far. good job florence and the machine!
B00AE2IJIE|1.0|We found the movie to be a disappointment.  'Sad to see poor values acted out by main characters throughout.  Even though obviously fiction, it manages to promote very realistic positive spins on moral-less behavior.  As a result we chose not to show ParaNorman to our family.  Could have been a fun flick.
B003CSV7TK|5.0|This version is the classic one.  The setting is in New York City in the late 1940s, so it might seem a bit out of date for some viewers, but that should not be the case.  The acting is excellent, and the story is very moving.  The little girl is played by a young Natalie Wood, and her mother is played by Maureen O'Hara.  The male lead (not Santa) is John Payne.  These are all excellent actors, and they give wonderful performances.  I put this film in the same category as &#34;It's a Wonderful Life,&#34; which is the Christmas classic starring Jimmy Stewart and Donna Reed.  I bought it because I like to see it over and over and to share the film with family (on loan only, of course).  It is a must see for children.  As for me, I like to see the film any time of the year when I need a mood adjustment.  It never fails.
B00AHXDECG|5.0|Great album - as good as his last.  He's one of my favorites and I would recommend to anyone who enjoys good music.
B00899E5B4|5.0|Love this album. Great guitar work. Shows Joe still has it. Tell Joe there is room for digital music,too! OK?
B0063GORYU|5.0|Just as good as the one on my main computer.Nice features and functions.  Would definitely recommend for those who like Spider Solitaire.
B00AMBLDEE|5.0|I truly enjoyed it, maybe because of low expectations. Definitely different without Matt, but still a great film. Would recommend.
B007TXN4TK|2.0|I used the beginner function and even then it was too fast and I have played keyboards before.  They need to improve it before I'd buy it.
B007HACDLK|5.0|The book I think is well written and it always keeps me interested..never a dull moment and I love the Rapp character.
B0063IH60K|5.0|Is easy to play and lots of functions to change the appearance of the screen and the back of the cards, colors, etc.
B00A77II0U|4.0|Love the game. Fun to play. Had trouble putting it down. Great story. Highly recommend if you like scary finding games. Great game.
B004SJ3BCI|1.0|Not everyone is a computer game expert and this game comes with no instructions on how to even start it.  Don't like it at all.
B00AMBH70S|3.0|I thought the ended was too open ended and did not wrap a lot of loose ends up.  Overall though, the movie had a good story and good action.
B005P06AAO|5.0|My daughter had been trying to get me to watch this show. I finally sat down and watched the entire series in one day. Love it!!
B00AHSIQWE|5.0|This movie has everything you want.  Action, story, plot twists, the whole 9 yards.  Would watch this movie again for sure.
B00AIQP9DE|3.0|I love the graphics and storyline but when I try to download it when its installing it doesn't let me play.
B00451VH8E|1.0|I had no idea when I ordered the Blue Ray that I might have difficulty getting it to play on my Blue Ray (which is about 5 years old).  I so far am unable to get it to run and it annoys me that the lead-in tells me to go to Blueray.com if I have problems.  My grandaughter and I were looking forward to seeing it..  We waited over 2 weeks to get it and then met with this frustration.
075669812X|5.0|Good value at a super price.  High quality & vivid colors.<br />Would recommend to anyone with kids interested in Lego's.
B006MW3V6U|5.0|Well acted!  Well done!  Great cast!  Superb costumes!  Great characters that draw you in!  Addicting, so much so that I watched the first season in 2 days!  Need I say more?
B000M5NRLC|5.0|I purchased for my granddaughter and she loved it and watched the entire movie in one sitting on her tablet.
B003CSV7TK|5.0|this is a great family Christmas show.  We've watched it from the time our kids were little - now they are both grown!
B004SJ3BCI|5.0|For those days you have to wait or try to keep your tongue this is the game.  I thought it was just for kids but no!!!  This is great and gets better and better the farther you go.  A must for folks that like to challenge their minds.
B00AMBLDEE|3.0|Loved the action but following the plot proved a bit difficult. However the last 45 minutes was riviting.  Liked it a lot but didn't love it.
B00AHSIQWE|1.0|This is a poorly written and poorly directed film about nothing. My husband and  fell asleep watching it, despite being Batman fans.
B000SGSU58|5.0|I think Michael Connelly is one of the better writers of today.<br />I have read every one of his books & I await each new release
B004SD5GZ4|4.0|can't tell you to much about it since I am not sure how often it is needed when working on the kindle fire hd
B001GUXJQA|5.0|I think Michael Connelly is one of the better writers of today.<br />I have read every one of his books & I await each new release.
B00A6PD9I4|4.0|Not a typical Disney love movie.  An excellent movie from Disney enjoyed watching with my kids.  A tale of bond between mother and a child.  Nice one enjoyed twice watching it.
B00AMBK0X4|4.0|Funny as heck; a smart movie that hits the cultural references. Raunchy  too; not a movie for the kids. I enjoyed it.
B0087HT36U|4.0|This game is fine.  Pretty simple to play.fgihbgt jhbgfffdd kjhgfddd jhgffghh deergv jhhy. Ju ddrfcg kk gygvff gfff. Ijhh ihbvg
B009HEJXFS|4.0|A good night cap that wraps up the MiB series. No Rip Torn -- which is too bad. No &#34;Frank&#34; the pug either.. The movie scenes are funny. The franchise should close with this one, however, the shark has been jumped.
0345803485|1.0|I am an avid reader, and I actually like books that go a little more in detail, but this was just ridiculous.  It was basically hard core porn masked as romance.  I had no idea what I was getting into, and sorry I wasted my time.  Unless you want pure trash with characters that too closely resemble Twilight, I recommend looking elsewhere.  I know a lot of people liked it, and to each their own, I suppose.
B003WEA4UM|4.0|A very intriguing, well written book composed of several stories of diverse subject matter, from different historical times (past, approximate present and future) with a very clever thread loosely binding them together. I saw the movie and then read the book.... wish it had been the other way around: the movie would have been much easier to follow. I will be buying it on DVD when it becomes available. Buy the BOOK now you won't regret it!!<br /><br />I'll be looking for more of David Mitchell's writings
0345803507|1.0|The final one of this B-rated paper porn.  I am a little ashamed that I continued reading them.  I ended up skipping at least 2/3rds or more of the book, as the sex scenes were ridiculously numerous and repetitive.  The plot is just terribly simple and unimaginative.  They remind me of a smut version of Twilight, with worse characters (though I enjoyed twilight, mind you, especially the books).  Anyway, as an avid reader that reads anything from Dean Koontz, Lord of the Rings Trilogy (and more Tolkien), Harry Potter series, classic novels, etc, this is probably the worst set of books I have wasted my time with.  Fortunately I am a very fast reader AND I skipped so many sex parts that they were all done quite fast (within a day or two each).
B001NLKT60|5.0|Enjoyed this book very much!!  ...and, of course, I jumped right into Book 3!  Can't wait to see how this triology ends.
B001MTENOC|5.0|My sister had me listen to this on audio while I was out visiting in August, and since we only got through about half of it I bought the Kindle version to finish.  I enjoyed this very much, and found it very enlightening.  Finally something just &#34;feels&#34; right.
B009FZHYKU|5.0|Best yet... full of action and suspense... can't wait till the return of the season in February ... yes yes yes!!!
0345803493|1.0|After the first book I should have stopped.  I will admit that they are very easy reads, but too easy.  I started skipping the sex scenes, as they became so numerous and repetitive!  And the romance part...ugh, please.  Still resembling a bad B-rated porn knock off of Twilight to me.
B008YU0AOE|4.0|This app is easy to install and use. I have used it and so have my kids. I would recommend it to friends.
B005KR6OBM|5.0|I started watching this show a year ago, roughly, after my father suggested it.  I was instantly hooked, and decided to buy all 4 seasons.  There are even bloopers from some of the shows, which I found to be hilarious.
B009RI4FRU|5.0|Great movie, husband can't have enough , so I had to buy it for him for Christmas ! Plus we are fans of Bill Murray , great actor!
B00AB7HESI|5.0|I first bought this game on the Nintendo DS. I couldn't put it down until I finished it.<br /><br />You really win this game with your imagination.<br /><br />The game starts you off with a goal like cross this gap. You then need to type in an item to &#34;spawn&#34; to complete the objective. It can be a bridge, jet pack, or a helicopter. The choice is yours, and there lies the charm. In this version they take it another level. Adjectives. It doesn't sound like much, but the ability to make a micro RC helicopter, a string, and a dynamite leads to some fun times.<br /><br />The game itself is very good in length. There is plenty to do, and even a sandbox mode accessible right from the start. Future updates, will also be adding more maps to play.<br /><br />The gameplay, polish, charm, and openness to the game is enough to warrant a purchase. This isn't one of those gimmicky tablet games. This is the reason why we play games.<br /><br />5/5 Enjoy!
B009FZFONO|5.0|I'm hooked since season 1 this show keeps getting better! Cannot wait for the rest of season 3! Great story and then add ZOMBIES and you have got a winner!
0670019933|5.0|I would recommend this book to all my friends jack kerouac's descriptive in depth descriptions of living on the road are as close as you can get to real adventure in the modern day. smoke rocks and gang bang
B005M5PENG|5.0|I thought amazon gave a reasonable price per episode and the quality of streaming was perfect. I also just became a fan and love the series
B002ZTIIXK|5.0|Nice pairing of the old with the new.  True KD Lang fans will really like this CD set.  I know I did.
B00846REIS|1.0|Well, this book was a big disappointment and a waste of money. I read FSOG. Got tired of the repetitive verbiage used but I still enjoyed it. I was also looking for something similar. Do not buy this book. You might as well reread FSOG. I can not believe Silvia Day hasn't been sued. The only difference is names and coasts. Every time a \\"new\\" character is introduced, I know exactly who it is in FSOG. I have never seen such a blatant rip off.
B006LSZECO|4.0|Lots of twists and turns. Kept me interested, and I enjoyed the book.<br />Would read a sequel if there is ever one.
B000I9YWDO|5.0|A classic movie; it's funny no matter how many times I watch it.  Maybe the best comedy of all times!
B003UYV08E|4.0|Although not as good as the first movie, it still provided thrilling escapist entertainment. Robert Downey Jr is still his quirky best in the role of Tony Stark.
B009A3NGF4|5.0|If you enjoyed the first cd don't hesitate to get this one. I was pleased by the quality and really enjoyed the cd.
B00004TS0E|5.0|nice movie love it  thanks its for my granddaughters  I have the old version but wanted to get it upgraded I will tell friends to get it as well for their children
0307592731|4.0|I heard great things about this book before I read it but, I was still skeptical about how a virtual one character story about a woman in the wilderness was going to stay interesting for 300+ pages. Happily, I was wrong and loved this book!<br /><br />I enjoy hiking, but my version of hiking is a couple hour excursion with some friends, so I cannot say that I went into this book with a keen interest in \\"hiking\\" in the PCT sense. Yet, Strayed's storytelling and writing style managed to keep me engaged on every page. She interspersed the admittedly colorful details of her \\"before\\" life with her hike on the Pacific Crest Trail (PCT), giving the story many dimensions and additional characters.<br /><br />Strayed is a complex person. At times, I found her self-pitying, rash, self-absorbed, and irresponsible. At other times, I found her inspiring, mentally tough, brave, and resourceful. Overall, I think her complexity as a \\"character\\" was part of what made the story compelling and she ended up being someone I rooted for.<br /><br />Finally, I can add the PCT and long distance hiking as a topic that I've learned a bit more about, an outcome I always appreciate in a good book.<br /><br />For more reviews, check out my blog, Sarah's Book Shelves.
B008CJ0KBU|4.0|This series sounds like it would be a cheesy scifi, but it is so not so.  Each episode lets you explore the very complicated world of the Fae and especially that of Bo, as she learns her way around.  Her plucky human side kick, keeps Bo grounded.  Yet Kinzi fits into the world better than most humans.  The rest of the characters are spot on and wonderful.  Enjoy!!
B0098VXBIA|3.0|It was cute... or better said, it had very cute parts, but it was a little spread all over the place... if that makes any sense.  Too many story lines... they still mix well, but too many.
B0076DELIG|5.0|Harry once again finds a way to go off the grid in the face of institutional opposition and &#34;common sense&#34; and come out smelling like a rose.
B0095R64AO|3.0|It was a very cute movie.  Perfect for one of those days where you just need to find something to watch and relax to.  Don't expect something completely out of this world, but it's still a good/fun watch.
B000AOA2G8|4.0|I bought one of these 20 years ago so I could remove my old cottered steel bottom bracket and install my TA Cyclotouriste triple.  This works very well for those old vintage bottom brackets, as well as old Campagnolo Record bottom brackets.  My HCW4 is sturdy steel with a chrome-plated finish and it will last forever.  My only beef is that long ago I broke off one of the pins, and replacements seem hard to get.  I would rather use this than a large adjustable wrench if it fits your fixed cup.
B00AMBM9MO|1.0|We waited and waited for it to get good and ended up turning it off.  It was slow and just not funny.
B0098VYCCE|2.0|I was looking forward to this movie, thought it would be a neat retelling of a classic.  boring, just plain boring.  Don't waste your money.  They went for visual effects, with very little story.
B00A757EFW|5.0|Dang. This is awesome! I did all levels without even losing a life! Are any of you surprised? You have to be surprised.
B000SW16NU|5.0|i love this movie. but this version is not the directors cut i thought i bought, i have it on dvd, this version is the original theater version,
1594744769|4.0|Jacob has grown up believing that his grandfather's tales of adventure and magical children were a fantasy. However, when Jacob's life is suddenly turned upside down, he must go on a quest to a tiny island off Wales to see the orphanage his grandfather grew up in. There, he discovers that there was some element of truth in his grandfather's stories...and he finds out that his life is in danger. This book was a fantastic idea. Riggs used some unique vintage photographs that he'd borrowed from a few collectors and built a story around the weird images. The photos were fascinating...I really loved looking at them. And I was excited to see what sort of story was built around them. However, the story was a bit contrived. I suppose that it would have to be, given that it's built around some randomly rescued photos...So Riggs deserves some credit for a good eye and a creative idea. His writing was a bit lack-luster...as I said, it was a bit contrived, and it leaned too heavily on formulaic fantasy. Shades of X-men, Groundhog Day, etc. abound. Nothing wrong with using old formulas, of course - no concept is every fully new - but overall the writing just didn't hold its own. I might or might not pick up the next book in the series...we'll see.  I'll probably read it eventually because I imagine Riggs' writing might improve on the second book, and it will seem less contrived if it's based on plot development instead of photographs.
B007SGLZP8|5.0|The plot, which seemed quite predictable at the beginning, will take you on a wild ride of surprises as you read on!<br />It was Vintage Grisham!  Great dialogue during interrigation sequences.  I highly recommend it.
0465068367|4.0|In the early 1930's the Chinese city of Nanking was occupied by Japanese soldiers. Tens of thousands of civilians were killed by Japanese soldiers to save money for supplies. Women were brutally raped and mutilated. But the stories of these victims and the foreigners who risked their lives to help them are not often told. Iris Chang wanted the world to know about these atrocities. Her brutal history was very difficult for me to read because the atrocities were described in such detail that I felt sick. I had to take frequent breaks. But it was a very engaging narrative, so I always wanted to pick it back up again. Chang certainly knew how to write an interesting story! Several times while reading the book, though, I felt as though Chang was too emotionally involved to write a completely reliable narrative. I'm not denying the massacres at Nanking, mind, but I think Chang had a very anti-Japanese view which would have made her prefer the larger estimates for death numbers, made especially-brutal rapes sound more common than they may have been, and made the Japanese sound purely evil as a whole group without exception. Nevertheless, this book taught me a lot about the relationship between the Chinese and the Japanese. As long as the readers keep in mind Chang's emotions, they can learn a lot from this engaging history.
B007X98S82|5.0|The recordings that I keep returning to are those of Nathan Milstein and Julia Fischer (such an interpretation at the age of 21 is amazing).  This recording joins that short list, and may even surpass that of Nathan Milstein upon further listening.<br /><br />Highly recommended (but get the Milstein and Fischer as well!)
0525423656|3.0|Cassia has been at a work camp for months now, but she hasn't had the chance to find her lost love, Ky. So, when an opportunity arises for her to be sent \\"accidentally\\" to the Outer Provinces she snatches it up. Upon landing in the Outer Provinces, Cassia and her new friend Indie run away from Society, following Ky's path. Meanwhile, Ky has also run away from Society with a couple of new friends. Will they find each other before Society or The Enemy find them? I thought Matched was a cute book - nothing amazing, but not disappointing. Crossed was pretty much the same. This story is more about world building than action or teenanged angst. That makes it unique in the YA dystopia genre right now. I look forward to reading the third, but it's not going to be in my hands tomorrow, by any means.
