B003VANOFY|4.0|Pros: Comfortable, great quality sound and voice communication. I am a woman and was worried it would feel too heavy, but it is well balanced and sits well. Works with glasses too.<br /><br />Cons: One star off because the surround sound occasionally needs to be &#34;reset&#34; by turning the surround sound switch off and then on. This appears to be a driver issue that will hopefully get fixed in the future; in the interim, disabling other sound output devices (speakers) seemed to take care of it.<br /><br />Note: I have an average-sized female head, and this fits well on the smallest adjustment. If you have a very small head, you might find it hard to get snug enough.
0316069434|4.0|When Harry Bosch starts on this twenty-year-old case, it appears hopeless. But Harry is nothing if not persistent, and soon he has a handful of pieces to a puzzle, and an emerging image that isn't what I first expected. Granted, there are predictable elements - Harry bucks authority, goes off on his own, and gets into a life-or-death situation - but that's part of why I keep coming back.
B005LAIISA|5.0|Never a dull moment with plenty of laughts. It tells a nice wholesome story. I want to save acorns for the squirrell.
B00AQ3K8IU|5.0|I couldn't put this book down!  Such a great book can't wait to read more from this author.  Must read!
B00APUQRPC|5.0|I am really intrigued to see Clint Eastwood still in the movies.  He did a real fine job as the dad.  But he sure had a lot to learn about being the best father to his daughter.  So often that happens in real life.  But it was good for the daughter to keep trying to make amends with him.  I truly enjoyed this movie.  Great story
B008XBCJ34|1.0|Was disappointed, first time watching the movie, I had to fast forward a few times due to the movie skipping.
B00APUYWYA|3.0|It was an ok movie.  But I wonder if all the girls were doing the actual  singing in the movie. It was a goofy movie. I won't ever watch it again though.
B004QX07G4|5.0|I LOVE Ellen and I LOVE this book...I'll be getting a pedicure, sitting on a plane or laying in bed laughing out loud!!! it's hysterical
B005K0HDGE|5.0|Loved this book! A great fiction without the of the wall sci-fi aspects. Very interesting to see snippets of history played out in this book. Highly recommended.
B0001AP13A|1.0|This is not a review on the album itself, just the quality of the vinyl record. I have ordered this record twice and each time side A skips terribly at the same exact spots. My only guess is that it is a bad pressing. Even my older, more scratched records do not skip. The album itself is one of my favorites, but avoid buying it on vinyl unless you want it for decoration.
B0083P1QUM|4.0|The story starts out kind of slow and jumps around, but the author brings it all together in a fast read.
B004JN1D2I|5.0|I really love this series.  I especially love how long the books are so that I can get into the plot.
0142403873|5.0|A really cute children's book they can easily follow along. Such a brave and clever little mouse. My kids love it!
B007SGLZP8|4.0|Grisham does a good job in this book of moving the plot along even though the real plot isn't revealed until the end.
B001UV4XIS|5.0|I LOVE THIS MOVIE. But the case is pretty cheap and the discs will get scratched if thrown around. Definitely worth the money.
B00002N9ER|5.0|Put this in my husbands stocking, since his huge D-cell Maglite is always rolling off the shelf... He had it installed in about 3 minutes. It works great and looks cool.
B001UV4XHY|5.0|I LOVE THIS MOVIE. But the case is pretty cheap and the discs will get scratched if thrown around. Definitely worth the money.
B000083E79|5.0|Cher is absolutely the best. Great sound quality, and photo images on case were wonderful. Contains most of her best songs
B006O6F932|1.0|Very disappointed. I purchased this for my 5 year old. It is extremely flimsy. Its already falling apart on us. Its practically made of cardboard. I never write reviews. But to pay $70 for cardboard, made by Mattel mind you is absolutely ridiculous. Buyer beware!!!
B00006CXSS|5.0|Although he has not opened the gift yet, he was blown away to receive the entire set as a gift
B008YWY0HK|4.0|Great animated film.  Better on a second viewing.  Pixar as always delivers the anticipated phenomenal animation.  The score was complimentary to the action and the story while &#34;simple&#34; was sufficiently embellished to keep interest throughout.  Suitable for kiddies and adults.  A good addition to any family film library.
B00787IR2Q|5.0|Having watched this movie when it first came out, I'd remembered that it was funny. I recently shared it with my son and found us both laughing and enjoying the happy--and touching--moments together. It's good to watch those classics now and again.
B007TXN4TK|5.0|This is a rather amazing game to play.  It took me a couple of times to figure out how it works but it's quite fun.
0071752854|5.0|This book got recommended to me by my business mentor, so I bought it. The ideas are great and eye opening. Showed me that all the work I thought I was putting in might actually ruining my chances of results.
B004LOMB2Q|5.0|Love this app. I can now take notes at meetings without dragging my laptop all over the place. Well worth the cost.
B008FYZIVY|5.0|I need not add my voice to the chorus about the writing, acting, scenery and cinematography - all excellent.  However, the blu - ray discs \\"stutter\\" slightly, every 5 seconds or so, in my blu- ray player (which is an excellent Panasonic with all upgrades downloaded).  What I mean by \\"stutter\\" is that the scene jumps ever so slightly at short, regular intervals.  It is not that obtrusive, but it is one of those things that once you notice it, you can choose to ignore it or let it drive you crazy.<br /><br />I don't know whether this is because this version was originally British and got this defect while being trasferred to US - playable form, or whether it is unique to my set of discs, or some other reason.  I know that my TV can be adjusted to try to fix this, but I have not tried that yet.  Based on the reviews here, at least a couple of others are having playability issues.  I don't know whether the DVD versions do this as well.
B004J64QSI|4.0|This is a concert film, not the play.  They were terrific performances, however, since I had not seen the play first it was somewhat difficult to keep up with the story since there is not much acting (someone gets her hair cut, she still has hair or another person is bleeding but there is no blood).  The performances were really good but it would be better appreciated after one has seen the play.
B003O86FMW|5.0|I can't put these books down! The ending makes it so you have to get the next. I'm already doing to pick it up!
B007BFSYMS|5.0|After having some trouble falling asleep as of late, I decided to try the white noise deal and after reviewing a handful of programs I selected this one and one other.  On the \\"other\\" program you get the app and then have to download your sounds.  This program comes already populated with sounds.  It appears that you can download sounds - but I haven't tried that as I was happy with one of the sounds as packaged.<br /><br />Lucky for me the \\"water\\" sounds just like my old aquarium and recalling those days I slept like a rock.  So gave it a go last night and instead of laying there for hours, apparently went to sleepy land in no time at all.  Normally I wake up several times during the night - but not last night.  Needless to say I think I'm hooked.<br /><br />Things I like:  Being able to set the amount of time the sounds will play.  Being able to adjust the app sounds separately from the phone volume.  I like the \\"Prevent Interruptions\\" button. I like the clock - but I have to say that, damn - it's bright.  I didn't read the directions and since my phone sits in a holder I had to place a hat over it to dim it down.  Upon reading the directions today though - it's very simple to darken or brighten the display - and even change colors.  There is a dozen or so different switches that one can choose from.<br /><br />Things I don't like:  Well - none so far.<br /><br />Big thumbs up and highly recommend.
B004PVKFR8|4.0|Bought it for &#34;Sail&#34;. Was very happy with the rest of the album as well. Some tracks seem un-needed, but can't complain. Great listening experience.
B0063GORYU|5.0|I spend way too much time playing this game. Great for someone who doesn't really have much of a life. I don't know if whoever made this .<br />silly 20 word rule knows how hard it is to type on a kindle.
B005LAIHYU|3.0|It's funny especially with Abe Lincoln swinging his ax as he fights off the vampires located near New Orleans.  Tim Burton does a fantastic job with the graphics.
B007J4T2G8|4.0|Purchased the triliogy to take a proactive approach to my wife's book clubs demand for something different.  I won the best gift
B007SGLZP8|3.0|Do not get me wrong, this is a good read but  the premise threw me off a bit.  There were times it was a bit boring but I have read better books by John Grisham.
B000267JQK|5.0|From all the versions of this CD is this the best one.<br />20 great songs, four of them only available on this CD, and a DVD with 30 minutes of live-concert and four videos.
B00A9X9TIW|3.0|Time Travel.... Always found interesting. I'm a huge fan of science fiction. I won't get into details about how good the movies I let you decide for yourself. Is it worth renting or streaming most definitely. The fact that future me could be sent back in time to be murdered by present me gave me nightmares.
B005GVA2L0|5.0|After the very bad album The Open Door the complete turn to a great album with four bonus tracks you must have.<br />Only the three ballads are not as good as the rest.
B007WEQ3K8|5.0|Nice variety of puzzled. Easy to use. Helps pads the time in the car while at the same time keeping the mind sharp.
B0091QSNEE|5.0|[Updated Review]<br />The Support team let me know it's a known issue for the Nabi2 and that they are working on it. They will also be adding new dishes to cook.<br /><br />5 stars once the scrolling issue fix is released. Thank you for the communication!<br /><br />--<br /><br />Screen auto scrolls up to higher rooms in restaurant. If you try to scroll down, it centers back up. Having same issue for Hospital game. Any fix?
B006OCM0G0|5.0|Make bake and sell u can improve your shop with gems and coins add  me as soon as u get an account oreo710
B005LAJ22Q|5.0|This show is very well done. Season one started out great and season two contiunes the trend. Movies and shows about Zombies have been done over and over but this particular series is easily the best in my opinion. It's done so well you can almost smell the corpses and you may start looking around a little more carefully after dark.
B0010SKTRA|5.0|A totally fascinating book that is accessible to non-scientists/non-doctors on the origin of various parts of our bodies.  Shubin writes with a flair for the comic, but it isn't silly.  I loved this book and can think of many people I want to give it to.
B00AQ3K8IU|1.0|The great reviews prompted me to buy & read this.  I got up to Chapter 3 & gave up.  Story doesn't really tie together well.
B009K45Y62|5.0|Collectible, looks amazing, super creative to have the Blu-rays just hidden in the back of the display broken cowl, and a great trilogy to watch to boot!
B000OZ0NXA|1.0|I decided to read the book before I saw the movie.  I was disappointed with the short, choppy sentences and waiting for the author to tie everything together as the story went along.  I won't be reading any more from this author.
B006KX3GXO|5.0|this app is great since im only 11 i take alot of pictures with my friends and with this app it really helps when the picture doesnt come out right you can change it with the app in my opinion this app is the best one yet
B007HACDLK|5.0|I have read the series and again Flynn has given a good read.  I had trouble putting the book down.
B0095ZMMCK|5.0|Also, not entirely unreal. Based around real international issues. Cyber warfare is upon us now and a very real threat to our security.
0545265355|5.0|I love these books!  Nice to have the box set of hardcover.  I'm reading them for the third time and find things I had missed the first and second time!
B006MW3V6U|5.0|I just love period movies and Downton Abbey is exceptional.  Clothing, enviroment, furnishings supurb.  I want someone to tell me this series will go on forever.  Whoever chose the actors really knows his/her stuff.  Congrats for giving us viewers something to watch with that has immense worth.  Thank you.!!!!!
B003JTHXOK|5.0|One of the best suspenseful, thrilling, romantic, couldn't put down books that I have read in a very long time!
B00A757EFW|1.0|Totally not what I was expecting this game SUCKS...Do not waste your time with this one. Would much rather play Bridges,Flow,Angry Birds,ETC
B009YQJ322|4.0|After watching this \\"low budget\\" effort to bring the serious Dredd back to the screen I was impressed. The work of Thirlby and Urban should be commended right alongside Headey and Harris and various others this movie rocked and given that with the money constraints and the spectre of the Stallone Dredd hovering over it says alot. Had this $40million dollar film made more than $36 million worldwide we would of been hearing about the second Dredd: Origins and Democracy, The screenwriter talked of a planned trilogy including the third film bringing Judge Death to the screen but alas we will just have this gem that reminds me of 80's movies like Robocop, Road Warrior and Die Hard to look forward to and this movie like those rocked! This day in a life take on Dredd gladly honors the comics and its dark humor. Dredd and a rookie Judge Anderson infiltrate Peach Trees one of several huge housing complexes that is a cross between an apartment complex and a mall where folks could live and die there nevering leaving. What starts as a routine investigation about three skinned bodies that fall from the sky becomes a race to escape with their lives. Anderson who is considered a mutant due to her latent psychic abilities is our eyes that follow the mostly quiet Dredd through the maze of guns and bodies. Like another movie I loved \\"The Raid:Redemption\\" this movie is fun simple and kick ass with the blood and action. Highly recommended.
B006LSZECO|4.0|The unexpected twists in this novel were very entertaining. It was a good  read though I didn't like the ending.
B007EECSFA|5.0|I've read all of Kate Morton's books and eagerly await the next one. She writes excellently and pulls together many strands over the course - usually - of a couple of decades. There is always an &#34;aha&#34; revelation at the end and the stories and characters generally live on my head for weeks after I've finished the book.
B00AA0TJO8|4.0|Love this game.  The only glich I run into is when the game gets interrupted I have to restart on Droid incredible.
B004FGMDOQ|4.0|It was a unique story and i kept my nose in it. The pictures added tremendously to the story. Would recommend it to others.
030758836X|1.0|I found this book to be so frustrating; I hung in there in hopes of it coming together into something that makes sense.  Nope.  The ending was less exciting than a match being dumped in water.  It was, however, a great cure for insomnia.
B006BDHAX0|4.0|Engaging and passable. But lacks challenge. more a race against the clock than selective removal of pieces. never the less, lot of levels and formations, so very enjoyable and effective gaming.
B008673ZAQ|4.0|If you liked 50 Shades of Grey you will like the Crossfire series. I personally liked this book the best so far! Had more story and plots then just the screwing the whole time. Can't wait fir the third book to be released in May!
B005K17RU0|5.0|Everything I could possibly need to know about the weather is here in one spot. Easy to read and use.
B0009P42S2|5.0|This product was great and the concept of the pricing was ideal for<br />the product type! This was great !
1609611543|5.0|I do not usually purchase health books but I saw this book in a store and felt it was staring back at me. It is a very readable, scientific (many references to university studies) explanation of the devastation that the excessive consumption of carbohydrates can wreak on the human body. Books on bad carbs are not new but few are as readable and convincing as \\"Wheat Belly\\". More importantly the book clearly identifies bad carb #1 - wheat. I read the book in a day and began implementing its recommendations that evening. Already I feel better about myself.
B009YP9L7U|4.0|I'll try anything free pretty much. It met expectations but I was a little disappointed with the ending. It summed it up too quickly.
B000E1ZBGS|2.0|I read somewhere recently that the directors/producers of this version made some intentional decisions to do unnecessary things like lowering the financial status of the Bennets to near-poverty, changing some of the dialog to sound more modern and reflective of (their own shallow experience with) teenaged girls, and changing the timeframe entirely because the director \\"didn't like\\" the fashions of the time in which Austen set her original novel. They apparently wanted this version to appeal more to a younger audience. Thus, along with the issues mentioned above, you will also find faster cuts and dialog, scenes in which the characters do things that would be completely unacceptable for the time (Lizzie with her hair completely down, or Darcy walking across fields with his shirt flapping open), and some very strange behavior from the family (Jane allowing a man in her room while she is in her nightdress). Not to mention the blatant attempt to infer sexual innuendo where there simply isn't any. (Seriously? That shot of the pig's...um...boy parts? Lizzie making a very vulgar check of Wickham's rear? ...Was the director influenced by a 13 year old boy?)<br />Knightly's portrayal bugged me more than a little. I couldn't figure out what she was giggling at half the time, and the other half, the character was doing things blatantly out of character for Austen's heroine. I did, however, appreciate the fact that Mrs. Bennet is slightly more lovable in this version. The 1995 portrayal grates on the \\"nerves\\" and is way over done, but I thought this actress did a much more appropriate job of it.<br />It is worth a look every once in a while, but if you want to see an adaptation that actually attempts to remain true to the story and the customs of the day (and not our narcissistic modern teenaged audience) then I, too, would recommend the Ehle/Firth BBC production.
111846446X|5.0|Written by the good people who put Raspberry Pi together, it is an excellent read. It's tone and accuracy say much about the desire of these people to put programming and innovation into the hands of all of us.<br /><br />Very much a hands on guide to success with the Raspberry Pi.<br /><br />I would recommend reading it before putting your hands on a Raspberry Pi.
B007VUA7VO|5.0|This app is great . I check it every day on my kindle fire hd ,and it is just wonderful. Of course this review might be  a little childish , because im only 10 . But i think this is a great app
B0063IH60K|5.0|Good game.  Haven't had much time to really enjoy it, since I am still learning how to download and the rest of my options on the Kindle.
B003O86FMW|5.0|I seen the movie and to be honest I've NEVER IN MY LIFE have read 10pages in a book let alone an entire book in about 36hours...I can't wait to read the last! This is amazing!!
B005DOKM9M|5.0|Like this sleeve.  I did find several lower cost sleeves at Big Logs, but this one is a lot nicer.
B0090EHVMC|5.0|Great family movie<br />We loved it. I highly recommend this movie to other families<br /><br />The animation was excellent, characters were great and the movie was a family favorite
B0086700CM|4.0|Hard game to play.  Still need to practice so I can control the movement better. Seems to be enjoyable tho.
B003JTHXOK|5.0|This book was amazing from beginning to the end. Nicolas sparks never seems to let Me down.  I can't wait for the movie next month!!!!!
B004SJ3BCI|4.0|My children gave me a kindel for christmas.. so I would not be taking a pile of books everywhere.. this is the first game I have had  .. and I find I am not very good at it .. But getting better .. maybe not so bad for an 80 year old..
B005XQLBU4|4.0|Easy to control and easy to  understand good to play if you are have only short time and you need a littel bit fun
B005CRQ4GU|5.0|Diary of a Wimpy kid is a great book to read and I suggest it to anyone even the people who hate reading because I am sure they will like it.
B003DNN0L2|5.0|The characters are interesting and enjoyable to watch. The story is pitch perfect. Fantastic Mr. Fox is truly enjoyable to watch for the whole family. It's a great kids movie and fun for the whole family to watch.
B00005JA8B|5.0|It was a good gift to give around the holidays. Would buy more. People love it more thean anything. thanks
B004TI5N38|5.0|David Baldacci could write about anything and it would become an instant best-seller. He has the style and ability and all of books are enjoyable and non-stop action and interesting.
B0050PYNO4|5.0|Great science fiction comedy. I personally love all the nods to other sci-fi favorites through out the movie. See if you too can find them all.
B00846REIS|5.0|This book keeps me warm in the Winter like a sweet Southern Summer!! Kudos Ms. Day... Kudos!!! Love isn't enough of a word to describe how I feel!!!
0307887960|5.0|Heard about this book through family members and friends. Skeptical at first, but after following the diet for 3 weeks, lost 6 pounds. Would recommend to friends to try it.
B004LSO6YI|5.0|Love this movie. It's entertaining, inspiring and simply awesome. I have a good mind to purchase this movie for my collection :-).
1449410243|5.0|As always, The Oatmeal made me laugh out loud.... and Bro. Inman sure does know cats; well done!! And all the signs point to our little kitteh's sinister plans for our demise....
B003JTHXOK|5.0|I could not put it down! finished it in 2 days. Hope the movie is as good as the book! Would love a sequel!
0330449931|2.0|The first person novel is a bit verbose and slow moving. Many facts helped me enjoy the story since I have been to Egypt several times.
B000JML90Y|4.0|Great to hear the other opinion, and it IS opinion.  We totally disagree.  Although we dont we still read other opinions
1439127700|5.0|For any US history and presidential history buff out there, this is a must read !!! It's a dense and incredibly detailed account of the relationships between living presidents and it's absolutely a wonderful read. There are so many great and entertaining stories included in it's 525 pages that you feel you learn something new on every page. I thought the authors did an incredible job specifically on the presidents up to Clinton and Bush 41. I guess time needs to pass before the interesting stories evolve from the more recent presidents. The behind the scene stories are riveting and again any person that is deeply interested in US history and politics will absolutely love this book.
B009JBZH54|5.0|Ordered as a Christmas present! Paid less for it here than in the store. It had extremly  fast shipping!! These are fantastic movies and a great item to add ro any movie lover's collection!
B005Z271Y6|3.0|I wouldn't recommend playing this when kids are around due to her course language.  Given her talent the cussing is entirely unnecessary.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|It was a great read! Great book keeps you intrigued!!!<br />Cant wait to read the next two books in the trilogy!
1594487154|3.0|I just did a subject line pitch.  Pink actually identifies seven different pitches, but don't worry you probably already do them.  Here is another one, a one word pitch for the book: Good.<br /><br />That means you should read, but feel free to skip parts - like the first three chapters.<br /><br />The new ABC's are a clever way to remember what you already knew - moderation between extroversion and introversion and between optimism and pessimism is good.  So is clarity.  The contrast principle reminds us that things are defined by what they are compared to - so careful comparisons (framing) are more important the descriptions you give things.<br /><br />The second section is a small toolbox of sales techniques.  Your elevator pitch too long now, Pink has some new options.  Being able to improvise, along with attunement (A from the ABC's) leads to more sales.  Take the long view and see sales as service.  All good points, none earth shattering or presented in great depth.<br /><br />If you already think sales can be a noble profession (does anyone think sales has to be sleezy?) - pick it up and thumb through it.
B0096HI226|5.0|Very entertaining!!!!!!!!! Good story, great characters, Great dancing! Channing and Mathew need to do more movies together. Highly recommend this movie
B00AF6MF9I|3.0|good game but when you exit game and come back later you find that all your work was not saved. Frustrating!!!
B005ZOBNOI|5.0|Amazingly well written love story. The story of Hazel and Gus was so touching. You wouldn't think a novel about two kids with cancer could be so good, but John Green developed such strong characters that I was crying as if I knew them personally by the end.
B0084AZXKK|5.0|Awesome! I've known about this book for many of my 60 years but never got around to reading it. Makes me want to read more of the classics!

B002PEP4SC|5.0|I watch Castle and I am SO glad I have watched the show then read the books. It is so much fun relating the characters from the show to the characters in the book. You can just picture Beckett and Castle in the storylines of the books. LOVE,LOVE,LOVE
B009NQKPUW|5.0|I had low expectations based on reviews.  But this was a must-see prequile (sp).  I enjoyed it.  Weak execution fo the storyline,  but wow what great elements of sci-fi.

B00APUYWYA|1.0|Didn`t connect with either the music or humor.  Definitely not for adults or the mature or music lovers or worth paying for
B008HK3XYK|5.0|This case is exactly what I was looking for! It barely adds any extra weight, yet feels like it is providing full protection. Many reviewers complain about only being able to use the ports when the case is open, but I love that it is PROTECTING my ports when I have my kindle tossed into my purse or sitting in my car. The flexibility of the angle you can stand your kindle works for everything. I prop it on a pillow next to me in bed to play games or read! The snap in function holds securely and I have yet to have an issue. High quality material for a great price! I've already recommended it to my friends and coworkers!
B004SJ3BCI|5.0|I love angry birds:) its fun its easy and its free!!!!!! angry birds hate green pigs after they take their eggs and revenge is all they can use!

B008673ZAQ|5.0|It was the second book to the trilogy and it was hot and I can't wait till the next book comes out.
B0094K1QR8|4.0|the movie starts out slow and repetitive, I actually thought about turning it off. So glad I didn't. after about the first half hour you get so engrossed you can't walk away if you try.
1582701709|5.0|Very inspirational.  This book gives you simple tools for living in a positive frequency.  You'll learn that everything in life is your choice and anything is possible.
B005V2EVBQ|4.0|The kindle Fire snaps right in. Adds almost no bulk and has complete access to the screen and buttons. Bought it on sale for $14. Very happy about that. But, definitely worth the retail of $29.

B0083ZRAJS|4.0|This book is so much better than the movie. There is more action and adventures. Dorothy meets more friends like, the winged monkeys (in the movie they were just used as evil minions of the wicked witch) the queen of the field mice, the China people (I wouldn't call them her friends) the wicked witch's minions, and the animals in the forest. If you've seen the movie you have to read the book, this book is so much better than the movie.
B00A3NQNUU|5.0|I LOVE THIS GAME!!!! It is very addictive to breed the dragons and feed them to make them grow. Most of the dragons require gems to buy, which disappointed me at first, but then I realized that you can get the same dragons by breeding, which is absolutely free once you have a breeding cave. The animation is very cute (the dragons always move) and my only regret is that I didn't download it sooner. I very highly recommend this game!!!! :-P
B005K0HDGE|5.0|This story put a few different twists on the time travel theme, and was a thoroughly enjoyable read.  Just the right length, the right level of detail, the right mix of subplots.  And King at his best in terms of razor-sharp description and commentary.  Especially enjoyable was the trip back to Lisbon Falls and the Moxie memorial.  It all brought back memories --- but hey!  Isn't nostalgia always better in retrospect?  But I digress...  Overall, a great story, very well told with good plot twists, based on another of King's \\"what if\\" premises.  Highly recommend this book.
B00884GR0W|3.0|We got this as free app of the day, and it was very entertaining at first, but the controls are awkward and mining takes a long time compared to minecraft. In my opinion, for a few extra dollars you can buy Survivalcraft ( a version of minecraft ) which is a WAY better game. It's a good thing that we got this for free, because I don't think it is worth it's price. I do like how it's more role play than similar games, though.
B00AAAKH80|5.0|This cd is really great. There isnt many cds out where al the songs are good like this one. great. group
B006ATJXQW|4.0|Pretty good because I never liked prequels take know?? Well I need more words for this review so ... okay
B0007939NO|5.0|As a family we love to see this movie over and over again.  We know all the songs and the kids know much of the dialoge.
B001KDQ4KQ|5.0|I've always loved Jodi Picoult and there was no disappointment this time. Great characters, wonderful construction. Highly recommend this book!
B00005N6KG|5.0|Great headphones.  Just what I was looking for!  I have been looking for these for a long time!  Glad I finally found them!  Great price too.
B004U8VWIM|5.0|As a chauvinist, I thought, seriously, this is a ballet movie and as appealing to men as The Notebook. But I was wrong. Great movie with some good twists. Natalie Portman won the award well deserved.
B004LSJCJM|5.0|Love Joe Bonamassa  I have two his albums (CD) now ( the other being The Legend of John Henry) and this is definitely the better of the two. Looking forward to picking up more of his recordings.
B00AYB1RGG|5.0|Great action, special effects, and cut scenes. Pay attention to how Dredd and his partner move through the building and tactically clear rooms and corridors. The most tactically sound choreography in a movie that I've ever seen.
B008RTE08E|4.0|For a Beatles fan like myself I enjoyed it, not as much though as their earlier movies, Help and  A Hard Days Night. It had a Monty Python feel to it but it lacked direction and a plot.
B005K17RU0|4.0|Really like this app. Installed quickly and forecasts are spot on. A great way to stay abreast of the weather when traveling.
B005NJU8PA|4.0|Seriously amusing - although if you can already cook it's a little tame in some respects. He seems to be all over how to be a better person, continuously educate yourself and improve. Great references to his other publications ;-) i.e. great cross marketing! Thanks Tim!
0698118308|5.0|This is a fun story about cloud shapes. My 3 year old grandson and I read this all the time. He never gets tired of it.
B0063IH60K|1.0|I found out that the so called free programs are not free, but are loaded with interruptions. Most systems include this game.
0064430170|5.0|My Grandson loves this book,especially the pictures. He loves anything that has to do with the moon,so it was perfect.
B002VECM72|5.0|Sandra Bullock is so great in this movie and we love football. We bought this as one of our first blu-rays because it is going to be a classic.
B005LAIHR2|5.0|My daughter and I saw this play in San Francisco and we loved it. I was worried that some of the charm would be taken by a big star movie, but it was just as much fun. I was worried that Tom Cruz would not fit the part, but he did such a great job. This movie is for fun and a gives a great sense of nastalgia of the age. That being said, even my teenage daughter loved it. We also got the soundtrack for a road trip to the beach and we had a great time (and laugh) singing along.
B004UJTG6Q|5.0|The book was really good. I loved how the  auhor captured all the emotions of all the characters in this book. I also liked how the author made me feel like i liked back then with tom. At the beginning i thought that tom and huckleberry finn were the bad guys but at the end it seemed like they were heroes.  That is why i loved this book
B00005YW4H|5.0|Her debut album...still her best so far. Her voice, with perfect orchestral back-ups, make this an album that belongs in every collection.
B0053TMP24|5.0|Super good read fit along perfectly with the first happy to tell you what I thought about this book really
044654759X|3.0|Heartbreaking. That word may apply to all of WWII??? Anyway, I'm currently reading IN THE GARDEN OF BEASTS by Erik Larsson, non-fiction, about the American ambassador to Germany during the mid-1930s and Hitler's rise to power--a book I highly recommend to provide an understanding about how all the horror came to be.
B00571F26Y|5.0|This book gives sound remarks about the genetic modifications done to our sources of wheat decades ago which has changed it into a super-carb.  I have completely eliminated wheat from my diet, consume much more fruits & vegetables, take Juice Plus+ every day, and have seen dramatic changes in my health.  This book is a must-read for people who are serious about their health & immune system.
B0094BB4TW|2.0|I really like this app. Unfortunately, the majority of the time it does not work at all on my kindle 8.9. It opens, and then attempts to connect with mobile fb via the internet. Sometimes, it can't even manage that and opens a random window. When it is working correctly, it is very good. I have been waiting for the developers to fix this since I received the kindle back in November. Unacceptable.
B00884GR0W|1.0|this game was fun until I figured out that when you are fighting enemies they have way more life and do way more damage to you so I tried to build a weapon and had to look everywhere just to get the materials for the block that takes more materials to make weapons.
B003JTHXOK|5.0|What a great book. I couldn't put it down.  This story made me want to keep reading to see what happened next. I would highly recommend!
B008KRJWEK|5.0|Several controls make this fun. Not your just go and kill zombies, you get different cars, boost and many obstacles.
B000SCHC0Q|5.0|For anyone who wants to know the real Afghanistan, and how the current conflict occurred, this is the simplest way to learn your history, geography and politics of that area, all while learning about the real people.
B005LAII08|5.0|I was a little concerned with the cost of this DVD set, however, it was well worth it.  We recently purchased a 3D television and some of the 3D movies are not as clear as others.  Brave is a fantastic video to view in 3D, even had my family members watch it with my 7 year old daughter.  Great buy.
B008Y2FRFO|3.0|the game is kind of. fun but gets. boring.  so times. so if you. get it don't be surprised if it gets boring
B009UX2YAC|5.0|This is the best game ever. I recommend this game. My high score is 658 coins. It is so easy once you get the hang of it. GET THE GAME FOR FREE.
B0064T6LV8|4.0|I like it a lot. I play it all the time. The game keep you busy and grabs your attention. I have to get use to it
B009WO7NQO|5.0|I like this game better than the regular Angry Birds and I don't have any problems playing it on my new Kindle Fire
B007TNS6JI|5.0|Great game! It is fun to play, and our whole family is happily killing all kinds of monsters. I'm sure yours will too.
B005IA9K2G|5.0|Wonderful, family,touching,emotional,fun story set at the turn of the century!  Love these musicals! Meet Me in St. Louis was terrific and worthwhile viewing for any family!
034580404X|2.0|The first quarter of the first book was bedazzling, but then I started to get bored. So much repetition and then, one crisis after another. I' just started the third book and have had the trilogy a year now. I don't know if I'll ever finish it.
B0074VTHKM|4.0|I don't care if it is a kid's book, I love this series!  Theodore is a precocious, responsible, yet childish character and his problems are never really earthshattering, but what a great read!  And the parents being lawyers explain the intricacies of his personality and his tackling of mysterious doings.  Perfect for business trips, I take him along for a quick read!  And of course John Grisham has proven to be a superb author, so what's to think about?  Read it!
B008AK8FHM|3.0|I got this in the hopes of getting a glimpse into the afterlife.  While you do get a glimpse, I felt like the story got lost in all of the  medical information.  Dr. Alexander is obviously an extremely intelligent man, and while I understand his desire to convey the whole picture, I expected the book to be mainly about his experience.  I'm glad to have read the book, but would have enjoyed it more without SO much medical references.
B0095ZQ36G|5.0|This is a comprehensive documentary that reads like a riveting novel.  Well written, it follows two pilots through WWII; the trials, stress, skills and emergency situations they encountered as well as the unwritten codes of morality and humanity.  A great read!
B005H0IW6W|5.0|the dude did a great job and it is really a nice piece of music album to play with family and friends at home.
B000003MZU|5.0|I hear it the first time in 1996 and I still listening to it.  The rhythm and lyrics are excellent.
B007PT1PEY|5.0|I wanted to have a collection of Sherlock Holmes in digital format. Thanks a lot Amazon for the great book.
B0058YPL66|5.0|I really love this show. The first season is wonderful. It's a great show for the whole family. The show is basically a whole new perspective on fairytales. =)
B009HELT3C|1.0|I just couldn't get into this one. The plot line and the humor was fair at best. Save you time and money.
B003ODIZL6|1.0|This book doesn't make any sense I don't know where the words are!I would recommend this book to someone who understands this book
B008XBCJ34|3.0|One of the best movies I've seen but the 3 D is just average and should be better... Hope to find a better 3 D movie..
B008QTV3X0|5.0|It's as good as everyone says it is. Claire Danes is as compelling as ever as a brilliantly-perceptive, mentally-ill, CIA analyst. There are plot holes that are big enough to drive an explosive-laden rental truck through, but it's still good fun.
B0064X7FVE|5.0|This has been very helpful to know in advance what the weather will be in a certain area I have to drive through.  Flagstaff varies and if the weather is going to be very bad I then can plan on going the southern route of Arizona instead.
B00AQ3K8IU|4.0|To me this book was a heart wrenching tale that was easy to get lost in. This kind of love may be unlikely in \\"real\\" life, but it sure is fun to read about.
B009HELT3C|2.0|I liked the story line but it falls short of the excitment and pace of the first two....<br />Worth a watch but not a keeper...
B0017SWPXY|5.0|I loved this story!! Once I started reading, I couldn't stop. This story had humor and heart and I recommend it to everyone.
B007EECSFA|4.0|I love love love Kate Morton, her first three books were outstanding.  I could hardly wait for this one. BUT, though interesting, not nearly as good as the first three. It drags in places but the ending will surprise you!
B003JTHXOK|5.0|Fantastic Book, Nicolas Sparks is a great writer. I've read many of his books and I love them each of them
B00ATDOVNK|5.0|Entertaining with many rooms and puzzles to solve. Well worth it. Variety of brain teasers with intriguing story line. As usual, excellent graphics.
B003XF1XOQ|5.0|This was a great book full of surprises and the end was just perfect. I hope when they make the movie it stays pretty true to the book
B0074D3CAQ|4.0|This book was ultimately very sweet but also quite hard to read. The characters were just in so much pain. The pace was a bit slow for me but the book is worth the read.
B002HFP0QU|5.0|I love this CD. Had bought in a store and threw away the receipt when I realized it had a scratch in it and did not play right. Re-bought from amazon and Im loving it.
B00138H1RS|5.0|If you are into Jazz music... You'll love this CD.<br />You will pass up your house listening to this CD. Lol<br />It's that good.
B00AMBH70S|1.0|it's not anything like the previous ones, which could have been good, but isn't. i need 6 more words in this review.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|I love the game alot!!!  but it did take some getting use too.. after all with temple run you have to move your device back and forth but now you can just keep your device still!!  so its going to take some getting use too... Other than that i absolutly LOVE IT :D
B0025KVLTW|4.0|I produced record albums in the 1970's and 1980's when the \\"producer\\" of the recording ALWAYS listened to what we called \\"test pressings\\" to do exactly what we are discussing here: namely, checking the product PRIOR to mass producing the product in order to avoid putting out something that would have systematic errors. We knew that there was always the potential to have a problem on the master \\"stamper\\" resulting in the same \\"error\\" in every record.<br /><br />The batch of vinyl could also have impurities that would only be discovered by listening to a pressing from that \\"batch\\". Ergo, the reason for \\"test pressings\\". One record I produced had 4 test pressings, reflecting corrections each time, before we got the distortion out of the final track closest to the spindle hole. If we missed it, that would stand as the testament to the artist, the record company, the producer, and any future commitment to ever purchase another record from them.<br /><br />I spent the week listening late at night to my recent purchase of Magical Mystery Tour on the \\"heavy 180 gram vinyl\\". I probably would have bought Revolver as my first purchase of the new releases, but I was dying to find out what the \\"misprint\\" was - and I found it! Ha! I cannot say, and I don't think we should tell anyone what it is, but don't it make ya wonder? Capitol/Apple/EMI, whatcha thinkin'? Anyone old enough over there to know what you're doing regarding The Beatles? If you need help, I am sooooo willing to drive up the I-5 and 101 to sit down and put in the time to walk these things through just to stop you from embarrassing yourselves and what is the Tower.<br /><br />Basically, my MMT lp is a clean pressing and really nice to listen to. It is a wonderful thing to listen to a warmer sounding reproduction of these old songs than what I thought I would be settling for in the 09/09/09 CDs. I'll give this vinyl 4 stars: strong songs, warm reproduction of a digital remaster, but lacking 1 star due to the high price and pop 'n crackling \\"heavy 180 gram vinyl\\" (referring to the wording on the promotional sticker on the album cover).ce and pop 'n crackling \\"heavy 180 gram vinyl\\" (referring to the wording on the promotional sticker on the album cover).
0525952616|4.0|If you like me have been wondering who would take Michael Crichton's place as the preeminent writer of science and technology thrillers then look no further.  The pacing is snappy if at times relentless, the science and technology is accurate enough and the extrapolations are plausible. It's an old school thriller with themes taken from today's headlines.
B003O86FMW|4.0|Very good book, but led up to a small let down.  Needed more story here and not finish in the middle of a fight.
B0047Y0FGY|5.0|Easy read that provides some comic relief. Tina Fey reminds us why we liked her so much in SNL. Still curious about her scar though.
B003DBOS7Y|3.0|I like this product.  I was everything i expected it to be, and i would recommend it for anyone looking for something like this
B002MQYOFW|5.0|Could not put the book down! The plot has a lot of twists and turns, making this story suspenseful and exciting.

0887307280|4.0|The author takes one through the analysis of a conversation and review of a small business owner. The principles provided in this book have been proven and I look forward to applying them in my own business someday.
B00AA7O6QC|4.0|i liked the action sequences, and explosion parts of the movie.  I definitely would recommend it to anyone that likes action movies
B008IJTFYW|5.0|I love this app!!!! There are so many varieties of sounds you can use to help you fall asleep or just relax you to the point of bliss. I mostly listen to this when I go to bed. The app has a timer for the sounds to play. You can pick one or s combination of many. Create your own moods. Plus side for me... I having had any bad dreams for a while. :) I strongly suggest you try this out. I think it just might be the cup of tea your looking for. Back to relaxation I go!
B005GVF95O|5.0|my young-un loves, i mean loves this application.  she plays it all the time.  it was definitely a great buy for her learning

B007BFSYMS|5.0|I love this app. I use it every night to go to sleep. This app is definitely worth the $1.99.
B0091REZMW|3.0|Nothing wrong with the service. Game isn't what i expected. it is not the kind of game that i play.
B009CPJHY4|5.0|My husband and I saw it in the theater when it first came out.  We loved it so much that we saw it two more times through On Demand TV.  Each time we saw it we picked up on something that we missed in the prior viewings.  Consequently, we decided it was a must to have in our DVD collection.  We are both in our &#34;golden years&#34; and related to much of what was being experienced by the characters in the movie.  The acting was SUPERB.  It was recommended to us initially by a friend/family member, and we have subsequently recommended it to many of our friends and family.
B009NPKTN6|5.0|I can't believe I like a musical, but Cruise makes it happen. The rest of the cast is also outstanding.
075669812X|4.0|Very nice item. Really entertaining for kids who are into Ninjagos. Highly recommended, but be ready to buy more Ninjagos... They're all displayed in the book...
0811879631|5.0|I've been a big fan of Pixar movies since Toy Story came out when I was a kid, and I even went to school for a degree in animation. This is an amazing pre-production collection for any animation admirer AND professionals alike to have proudly on their bookshelf. It sits proudly on mine :D
B006WQLH7G|5.0|have avast on all my pcs.  works well on my kindle. very important to have to protect all your information
B009FZHYKU|5.0|Great story along with a lot of monsters some of them alive but the majority of them are dead of course.
B0070Y46UY|5.0|This book fills every readers craving from start to finish. The ending has completely blown my mind. I am floored. So fantastic beyond belief. READ THIS BOOK ASAP BEFORE THE MOVIE COMES OUT!!!!!
B00992CF6W|5.0|I love this game. My brother and I play survival together. We have soooooooo much fun. We collect resources then build a home before night. Because at night monsters come. There are spiders(which only attack at night)  creepers( which are little green things that blow up and come at night) zombies and skeletons with bows and arrows. On creative mode there are so many blocks to choose from. There is gold and some type of diamond. But there are lots of other things to build with. My latest thing is a cute city. I play it all day.
B000EYK4GW|5.0|Awesome value! Great condition! My niece's favorite movie and she absolutely loves it! She watches it constantly. Soooo glad I could find it in such great condition for such a great price. Should've seen my 2 year old niece's face light up when she opened it on Christmas! THANKS!!!
B009VSW15Y|5.0|Received the Kindle HD for a gift - a great feature was the camera; so when I saw this app at this price - it was great!
B004G600A4|4.0|Fairly good value. Was descibed as very good condition and I wouldn't say it was in &#34;very good&#34; condition. THe disc was fine but the case was in rough shape
1878424319|5.0|this book is wonderful! i borrowed a copy from a friend and loved it so i bought a copy myself. recommend it to everyone! quick read but very rich.
B0021L8UPS|5.0|This is a great movie, what a great ending to this movie.  I am a huge horror fan, but this isn't gory, but a sick twisted plot, which made the movie great in my opinion.
0307276902|5.0|i read this years ago and wanted to read it again. i dont read many books more than once but i will this one. very exciting and shocking. even if it isnt a true story there is a lot to learn form this book.
B007FEFLTO|5.0|I absolutely loved Book One of the trilogy and have fallen in love with this one.  I have the hardback and the Kindle version and am thoroughly enjoying the reading experience.

B009ZQGNPQ|5.0|This is a great show, I just rewatched seasons one and two in anticipation of this third season.  can't wait to get started!<br /><br />  FYI, you can watch this show for free on the PBS website.
B00A77II0U|5.0|Very thought provoking. Definitely could not put it down!<br />Seems short but is worth the money for the amount of different types of puzzles involved in the game play.
1451673442|3.0|Very interesting book to read it says that we should always be grateful for what we have which is true anyway weather you belive doing the excercises or not

B006AX6ONI|5.0|Short and to the point. Clear advice from a proven professional. Mark Cuban shares his success story, and advice on how to take it to the next level.
1451648537|5.0|It read like a novel but everything was real. I couldn't put it down. I bought four copies for friends and business colleagues
B00AIUUXHC|5.0|I have an incredibly stressful job and I love to come home to this game. I love the fact that you're playing the game from the shark's perspective&hellip;the graphics are good and I love eating the swimmers. I also really love the different marine life that come into play as
B007EECSFA|5.0|&#34;The Secret Keeper&#34; is a great read, the story moves smoothly through time, past and present, that leads you from a tragic beginning to a heartwarming surprise ending.  Would recommend for book clubs.
B0076DCT2G|4.0|Nelson DeMille always keeps me wanting more.  I felt this was a good book and enjoyed it but not as memorable as some of his past books.

B003JTHWJQ|2.0|i am not a religious believer so that is not the ideological difference i have with dawkins. i am also a great believer in science, so that is not the issue. however, i understand that science has limits. science has nothing to say about god, whether god exists or not. what can an undersea creature tell us about bicycles? nothing. does the undersea creature believe that bicycles exist? no, it does not. but that doesn't mean that bicycles don't exist. science has no ability to 'sense' god. that doesn't mean that god does not exist. it only means that science has nothing to say on the matter.<br />the next book i bought was Rock of Ages by stephen j gould. this is the point that gould makes in his book. he is a lot wiser than dawkins.

B005HSL626|5.0|I played the game on my Ipod. It is much better on the kindle. This is so much fun, love it!!!
B001RJTFP4|5.0|One of the best opening 20 minutes of any adventure film.  Plus, vampires to boot!  A great guilty pleasure of a film.
B006LSZECO|1.0|This book started out with an interesting premise;however the author failed to make any of the characters the least bit likeable. In my opinion, that is vital to keep the reader interested. I plodded through to the end of the book, hoping to see justice done, but again, the author failed me.  I doubt I'll read any of this author's other books. Unfortunately, I am having serious trouble finding good books -- way too many poorly written books get rave reviews.
B008MG1E4A|4.0|I read Blackhawk Down and that was a complicated read with several characters. This seems to be written for high schoolers, which is fine. I would have liked more detail , but as he states in the beginning he can't give out too much info because it's top secret info.
0141034645|2.0|Full disclosure: My review of this book is based on having read only the Preface and the section of Chapter 7 on \\"Animal Rights and the Decline of Cruelty to Animals.\\" Furthermore, I am an animal rights advocate. Nevertheless, I feel I am in a position to make a legitimate criticism of the book's central thesis. You can of course judge that for yourself.<br /><br />The Better Angels of Our Nature defends the thesis that violence committed by human beings has been on the decline, indeed drastic decline, throughout the last five thousand years. To his credit Steven Pinker gives explicit recognition to the animal issue as a component of the problem of human violence. Thus, he does not restrict the topic to violence suffered by human beings (at human hands), but instead admits under his purview violence to all sentient beings. So far so good.<br /><br />Pinker also reviews the history of the human mistreatment of other animals in lurid and comprehensive if highly condensed detail. Indeed, his opening confession of partially inadvertent complicity when a college student is one of the most horrific narratives I have ever read, and Pinker fully intended to elicit that response. Pinker is also aware of \\"fine points,\\" such as the disaster (for animals) of substituting chickens for cows in the American diet; and he extends his moral concern to fish as well.<br /><br />Where Pinker goes seriously wrong, in my opinion, is in his assessment of the current prevalence and future prospects of human violence against other animals. He seems to take the public relations pronouncements of the animal-use industries, in particular biomedical and agricultural, at face value and therefore as indicative of a meaningful decline of violence.<br /><br />If I may speculate: I think Pinker has been made gullible in this regard by three factors. First, he is impressed that \\"unlike the other Rights Revolutions, the movement for animal rights was not advanced by the affected parties themselves: the rats and pigeons were hardly in a position to press their case\\" (p. 456). From this he infers that it \\"has been driven purely by the ethical principle that one ought not to inflict suffering on a sentient being. ... Nor has it been a by-product of commerce, reciprocity, or any other positive-sum negotiation; the animals have nothing to offer us in exchange for our treating them more humanely\\" (p. 456). While this is appropriately flattering to animal rights advocates, it is fallacious to infer further, as Pinker does, that the entire animal movement may be thus characterized.<br /><br />The problem is that Pinker fails to recognize the schism in the animal movement between the rights approach and the welfare approach (regarding which see, for example, Gary Francione and Robert Garner, The Animal Rights Debate: Abolition or Regulation? Columbia University Press, 2010). The welfare folks generally approve (or at least see as inevitable) the use of other animals for human purposes but seek to make that use \\"humane.\\" Unfortunately, as Gary Francione would argue, this serves mainly to entrench animal use, which, as Lee Hall would argue, is inherently prone to animal abuse. And perhaps the most effective means of disguising and at the same time implementing this \\"lapse\\" from use to abuse is by appropriating the animal welfare terminology, beginning with the word \\"humane\\" (regarding which see my own little essay \\"What Is Humane?\\" accessible online at the Hastings Center's Bioethics Forum blog).<br /><br />The second (and related) cause of Pinker's gullibility, I surmise, is his acceptance of the notion of \\"justification\\" of animal use. For it is precisely by \\"justifying\\" such use that it is transformed into \\"humane\\" use ... regardless of how inherently cruel (or deadly) it is. Thus, he writes, \\"The change in the treatment of laboratory animals is part of yet another rights revolution: the growing conviction that animals should not be subjected to unjustifiable pain, injury, and death\\" (p. 456). Yet nowhere does he explain to the reader that this is a toothless limit on animal exploitation and indeed torture and killing. This is so for two reasons: (1) Anything whatever can be done to a laboratory animal provided it is deemed \\"justified\\" and (2) a procedure can be deemed \\"justified\\" provided it is necessary to carry out the intended research. (The most authoritative and comprehensive critical account of the real world of animal experimentation can be found in Larry Carbone's What Animals Want, Oxford University Press, 2004.)<br /><br />Pinker is so carried away by this idea that he can make an absurd statement like the following: \\"live animals [are] now protected from being hurt, stressed, or killed in the conduct of science\\" (p. 465). My God, they are (almost) all killed! Millions of them, every year! (See Carbone, p. 22.)<br /><br />My final speculation about the roots of Pinker's gullible acceptance of animal welfare bromides coming from the animal user industries is its being due to, quite simply, his not being a vegetarian (as I infer from his unqualified remark on p. 470 about hosting a dinner party in the 1990s and his refusal to comment on \\"my own practices\\" in a December 2011 interview at The Vegan Option blog). It is my abiding conviction (based on biased hunch) that the main reason people who are otherwise responsive to the plight of other animals at human hands nevertheless continue to condone it is that they are complicit in it, and this mainly because they refuse to give up the prerogative of eating animals and animal products. Thus, in no other way can I really comprehend why a person as intelligent and aware as Steven Pinker would be capable of spewing forth the red herrings and apologetics of his penultimate paragraph on page 474 (q.v. since it is too long to reproduce here) and then concluding the whole section on animal rights with the statement, \\"Given the recent changes in sensibilities, it is certain that the lives of animals will continue to improve\\" (p. 474).<br /><br />And what has all this to do with the main thesis of Pinker's book? Quite simply that in recent times, and with every prospect of increasing as there are more and more human beings on the planet and more and more of them become relatively affluent, the amount of violence in the world perpetrated by human beings against sentient beings has reached unprecedented levels due to technological advances in the exploitation of other animals. (For example, Google the Animal Kill Counter at the Action for Animals blog.)y, and death\\" (p. 456).

B0034G4OXQ|3.0|This picture features several attractive performers and one great visual effect, but it answers no questions about the \\"hereafter,\\" or where we go after we die.  The computer-created tsunami that opens the show is almost worth half the price of admission all by itself.  But beyond that, the film's pleasures are for me largely of the travelog variety in that I always enjoy seeing foreign locations such as Paris and London, etc.  The movie's one depiction of the hereafter is limited to a brief enactment of the sort of thing generally reported as a \\"near-death\\" experience.<br /><br />Matt Damon plays a reluctant \\"psychic\\" who has an apparently real ability to see a brief event in his subjects' past, although he's decided that a career driving a forklift is preferable to raking in the bucks doing five-minute \\"readings\\" for bereaved clients seeking contact with the departed.  Merely holding a person's hands for a moment allows Matt to enter that person's memory for an instant and thereby establish contact with the departed.  Actually, although we see the memories through Matt's eyes, we don't hear the departed talking to him, so his reports in that regard may just be a competent cold-reader in action.  And one wonders what more prolonged physical contact might produce in the way of insight.<br /><br />This film demonstrates again that with competent personnel and enough money, even a paper-thin plot idea can be turned into an entertaining flick.
B009FZHYKU|5.0|Great.  Season was great.  Word, word, word, word, word, word, word, word, word, word, word, word, word, word, word, word, word.

0765325950|5.0|It's hard to believe that my first reaction after reading 909 pages, of the 14th volume of a series filled with long books, was that it was too short to tell the story it had to tell. We're talking about a book, whose ch. 37, \\"The Last Battle,\\" is 190 pages long, and I think it wasn't a long enough story? Yup. This whole novel is a climax, but I think that if Robert Jordan had lived, we'd have seen at least a volume 15 of the Wheel of Time saga and the series would've been better for it (I'm not merely talking about expanding this last volume into two, but the final 3 novels into 4).<br /><br />What we do have, however, is darn good stuff. There are some excellent twists and turns as the prophecies unfold. We finally get an idea as to what it would've been like to have had to battle channelers in the Age of Legends. One thing I have problems with is that short shrift is given to some characters, including some of the major ones, especially considering the deaths of some of them. The fates for some characters delighted me, for others I was enraged, some at how their fates were mere asides, other times at the loss of particularly beloved characters.<br /><br />This concluding volume had an almost impossible task, and manages to do an amazing job, almost living up to the expectations that the series created. There are flaws here, but there is also an abundance of brillance. There is the thrill of desperation as the forces of Light end up with major struggles, which turn into hopeless tasks, and of watching pieces of puzzles scattered across the preceding volumes suddenly sanpping together, explaining things which had previously not been solved, for example Demandred and his influence suddenly makes all kinds of sense. A great deal remains unresolved at the end of this novel, which will no doubt delight the fanfiction crowd. But it is an ending, one many thought or feared would never arrive.<br /><br />Kudos and thanks to Brandon Sanderson for bringing this to completion, but above all, thank you Robert Jordan, Mr. James Oliver Rigney, Jr., who passed from us much, much too soon, prior to his 59th birthday. We'll always wonder \\"what if...\\" you'd lived to see this to completion, but thank you for what you have given us. The epic series \\"The Wheel of Time\\" is \\"MUST' reading for any fan of fantasy...and anyone who just loves a great story.

B000001EXR|4.0|Probably the most unappreciated KISS album. I guess many fans have expectations of what KISS is or should be in their opinion & this album wouldn't fit that. I found it refreshing to hear the band grow in a new direction. \\"Grunge\\" (I hate having to use that generic label) was very popular at the time & KISS has been following the trends since Dynasty. I don't know for sure but if I could ask Paul Stanley I bet he'd say \\"In the Mirror\\" was influenced by Soundgardens \\"My Wave\\". I don't understand the negative reaction to this album, were they supposed to do Revenge part 2? The natural tendency for most bands is to grow. Otherwise they become stale. Better to do something different & as a listener I like to have something that I didn't expect, as long as it's good. The alternative is to stay in a rut recycling old sounds & images (Tommy & Eric S) in hopes of coming close to past greatness. That may make them more money but is it producing anything that will stand the test of time?
B008JMKN4Y|5.0|This book was just what I needed, it was refreshing and fun...but heart wrenching and romantic in it's own way.  I've already pre-ordered the sequel, Walking Disaster!

B009IJJB8G|5.0|This is a very well written and acted series.  Each episode is unique and tends to avoid repetetive plot lines, yet is very consistant and familiar, and intriguing.
B000002H2H|5.0|Metallica has a number of great songs, but not all their albums are worth the time to listen to star to finish. MoP is overrated, but Lightning oddly enough winds up with the opposite fate--being their underrated masterpiece.<br /><br />Album's strongest part is the center (Title track, For Whom the Bell, & Fade to Black), but the songs coming both before and after do not disappoint. They reintroduce the album's atmosphere as well as vary the tone. That's the big advantage this album has over MoP. MoP is nothing but angry, Thrasher Metal. This album wavers between indignation, sorrow and heroic resolution. It has the gem Escape--which is one of the few great feel-good Metallica songs out there.
B0063IH60K|3.0|Works fine on my kindle fire hd. Could have more options, but for a free app it is fine. Plays well, but it took me a few tries to figure out how to skip the ads.

B0025UHKNS|2.0|I had high expectation. I have been a long time polar user and decided to give this a try. The website is great. However, the user interface on the device itself was not creating with user in mind. Garmin has discontinued the items (which I did now when I purchased the item).<br /> Acquiring satellite signal can be a challenge. Furthermore the calories count is way off base: a 5 mile run apparently burns 250 calories (so it's nearly half of what it should). This is an issue for me. I am a long distance runner, and having a correct assessment of what my calories expenditure is crucial to maintaining a healthy weight. I have tried to contact Garmin about this issue and all I got was an automatically generated answer which contained the same instruction as their online helped offer (so in my case customer support was awful).<br />The battery life is poor if you use the GPS. The plus side of things is when you ran out of power during a work out, the device saves whatever you have accomplished thus far in the work out.<br />Another downside is I occasionally work out indoor: but device is not compatible with Gym cardio equipment (which never was a problem with Polar: I could walk into the gym and the treadmill immediately recognized the HR monitor).<br />So in the end, I am happy that I did not purchase a more expensive HR monitor from Garmin. When  this stops working, I will probably go back to Polar. Too bad because this had great potential, but the lack of customer support did it for me.
B0084AXZK0|4.0|Loved this book can't believe I have not read it til now. I wanted to know the story behind the beautiful face that I had heard so much about and now I know. Was quite shocked that nobody I know has ever read it before. It is a short book so take a few hours and read it.
0345803485|5.0|I did not read this book nor did read the two books that came before.  However, My wife read all three books in about two weeks, and we just had the best sex ever.  Guys, tell your wife how much she means to you...  be serious...  and hang on for the ride....
B000FCJZ3G|5.0|I am from Poland so maybe there would be some English mistakes in my review.<br />I am very rarely write any review of any purchased book - but in this case I would make an exception. You see- maybe you think you know everything, but after I read this one - just one thought came to my mind- oh my god- so many years lost with banging with head on the damn wall! After reading and conseidering many issues mentioned in book - I got an insight what is totally wrong with my mind and thoughts. I also wanted big success- and have much desire with getting it - but it didnt help me much.<br />After that book I found out that I just want money, but still want to be the same as I was for many years- man with attituyude of poor guy. It wont help. So first I had to find what is stopping me inside. The book was great! And after 3 days I got - first sale online!<br /><br />First money on internet! Now you see that this book works. I love it. Thank you T. Harv Eker - for making this ideas available to be read by pople like me! Regards from Poland<br />Daniel

B00AQ3K8IU|1.0|Wow this book is terrible. It is the literary equivalent of an After-School Special. It seems that perhaps repetitive, non-descript, mind numbingly implausible writing has an audience though..probably pre-teen girls who are still naive to the way the actual world of dating works. Too bad the subject matter is too adult for the audience that might actually think this book is well written. Some parts of the story make absolutely no sense, it's as if the author forgot her own storyline and just threw in some &#34;plot twists&#34; without thinking them out at all. Don't waste your time, there are so many well written books out there!!!
B00632HWOG|3.0|The phone app works better that the computer version. The recent updates make a big difference in performance, which is a huge improvement!
B008PZ69RU|3.0|I was snowed in one afternoon and rather than do anything productive I elected to watch this film.  To my surprise it held my attention and I confess that I rather enjoyed it.  The story is interesting -- how lives connect and there are lots of great locations: Paris, Vienna, London, the Denver airport in a snowstorm. Many languages are spoken and a certain amount of skin is shown.  People fall in love and leave and switch partners, quit jobs and get fired.  An Imman and a psychiatrist are consulted as well as a call girl.  There's a Russian gangster too --something for almost everyone.  If I sound condescending I have to admit that I sat through the Whole Thing and if I were really honest I'd probably give it four stars.  But I won't because I don't really want to give shoppers the idea that this is a better film than it is.<br /><br />The cast is great, though and there are a few genuinely moving moments in the segment with Anthony Hopkins as a man searching for his missing daughter.  Jude Law is always exquisite and the rest of the cast is very good.  If you don't expect high art or you're snowed in you might enjoy this film.
B001NHNG64|4.0|another good Reacher story, this kept your interest until the end.  It pulled you in and did not let go
0765325950|5.0|I'm writing this review because I loved the book and I thought it was sad how most of the negative reviews of the book was simply because it was sold in hardcover before ebook. The review should be of the product. Video game publishers often delay PC releases. That doesn't mean that the game is bad and you should one star review the game when you've never played it.<br /><br />Anyways, I loved the book and I think Brandon did a great job finishing the series. I'm sad that the series is over, but I'm glad as well.
B004J4WKTW|4.0|I spent all day reading this story on New Year's day and enjoyed every minute of it! There are things I could criticize if I wanted to, but I preferred to just immerse myself in the story and enjoy the magic of it. Loved the descriptions! I liked it a lot!

B006Z7Z3S6|1.0|Wow, what a boring movie, the cover had all these great reviews of how fantastic this movie is and that it's the best horror film of the year, what a let down, kept waiting for the horror to come, it didn't, my wife fell asleep it was the interesting, the characters were fine and the acting good, but the story was just not up to par, could not consider this movie as anything but a waste of time, sorry I bought it and paid full price, trying to hard, special effects were nothing special, no scares, they say old time creepy, not really, the old time horror movies that relied on atmosphere and story development are nothing like this movie, don't waste your time, though the movie might bore you to death.

I zipped through it, chapter a day.<br /><br />However, I am very upset that just reading through it once the book has fallen apart, but I have taken all my notes inside the book, therefore a new book is hardly an option as it would take way too much time to go through and re put in all of these notes, but I would like a refund, because a book should not fall apart after reading it just once. I have owned the book for less than 10 days and the majority of the pages have fallen out.<br /><br />all in all, totally worth reading, just disappointed that my book fell apart in such a short amount of time with me just reading it.
B007XKEY6Q|5.0|This app is one of my favorite. It is so addicting. Although it can be a challenge it is very fun.
B000GCFY0I|5.0|title is true nuff said, but since 15 more words are required, i have to keep writing, three, two, one DONE!
B007SGM084|5.0|This book is one you can't put down. Very good.<br />I would recommend this book to everyone that's likes novels or love stories.
B00ABGEFWC|5.0|cool and very fun u never get bored is so and I llove it you never get bored is so much fun
B007KOMTUI|5.0|My wife and I have been watching this show since Season 1, and loved every season. This one is no exception. The creators keep a very consistent level of quality and entertainment. After House M.D. ended, this is the only show we've been watching. Can't wait for the next season!
B001EN71CW|4.0|I watched this for the first time.  It was quite entertaining.  It is sad that there isn't more because I have developed an interest in the characters. You can tell that the director had a lot planned as so many ideas were set in motion.  I can't give it 5 starts for two reasons: Firstly, The Blu-ray transfer wasn't that good.  Lot's of noise.  The opening battle scene in the first episode was terrible in terms of video noise.  It made me feel that the whole series might be like that.  Fortunately, it wasn't as bad but still not a clean transfer. Secondly, it's not appropriate for younger aged children due to adult themes (sexuality, violence and brief nudity).  I realize that this was intended but I find this unfortunate because I believe this series could have had a broader reach which may have helped it to survive (or not - no one really knows).
B007THA4FI|4.0|Casual vacancy has the good character development that we love and expect from Jk Rowling. I'm still reading the story but an enjoying it so far.
B00ABKGG0C|4.0|My friends were raving about this book, so I gave it a shot. I'm glad I did--it was one of the best fantasy books I've read in a long time.<br /><br />I'm pretty picky about fantasy. I often pick up fantasy books that look good, only to find long sections where nothing happens at all. Not this one! We meet the main character right away and the story gets started. And then it keeps going. The lore and legend of this world are deftly woven in with the action, so there are no boring parts to suffer through, because the story doesn't have to stop while Ryan explains things. The characterization is quite well done also, with even relatively minor characters having story arcs of their own.<br /><br />I see that some other reviewers noticed that this book needed an edit before it was published: yes, there are spelling mistakes as well as grammar mistakes and sentences that need the punctuation cleaned up. I almost quit reading when I saw that the first section is entirely in italics--ew, my eyes! And a lot of sentences were so confusingly written (commas in the wrong place, comma splices, misplaced participles, and more) that I had to go back and read them two or three times.<br /><br />Please know that I do not hold any of this against the author. All the mistakes would have been caught had this book been copy-edited. Since it was self-published, that evidently didn't happen. Good copy-editors are expensive, and so I don't blame the author for not hiring one. I see that he has been picked up by Penguin, so I'm hoping that future books won't have the same problems.<br /><br />In any case, I'm glad I read this book, because I really enjoyed it. It's a fast-moving story that takes place in a fully-realized fantasy world--if that sounds good to you, I urge you to forgive the errors and give it a read.
B008CJ0KI8|3.0|Where have I heard this style before? Oh yes. Sounds just like Dwele. But hold on - Dwele was doing this stuff ten years ago. Can't remember Dwele's album making the top 10 best of year list in all those rock music papers, and getting all that slavering adulation. What's Frank got that Dwele hasn't? Not much as far as I can see. Do yourself a favour, buy Dwele's first album too (or instead). It's better.
B00AMBK6J2|4.0|At times, a very funny movie with an amazing warped spin off of the pinocchio idea. Mark Wahlberg is excellent playing the straight faced lead character. While the language and some scenes are definitely r-rated, it is one of those few movies that my wife and I can just sit back and have full belly laughs at times.
B00AA7O22U|2.0|The first expendables movie was probably more enjoyable for the sheer novelty of seeing all these action stars that I watched over the past 25 years in one movie.  Well the novelty has worn off (and maybe I shouldn't have been googling their ages while watching the movie) but after seeing how ridiculous the story was and listening to the often overused one-liners I finally came to the realization that these guys are all laughing to the bank in whats seems to be their last grasp at the movie money tree. They're hoping your money is &#34;Expendable&#34; but don't bother funding their botox injections, face lifts and child support payments.  I guess I liked it even less than I originally thought.
B00AE2J5HI|3.0|Lame story<br />Mediocre acting because of  an unfocused script<br />There are alot of other movies you should spend 2 hours with--like: &#34;Perfect Pitch&#34;, or even watching TV episodes of &#34;justified&#34;.
B009M5CJI0|5.0|This book of many pages was intimidating at first, but Follett writes so well that the book is a fast read.
B0071XO8RA|5.0|I like science fiction, but haven't read anything in that genre for a while.  I'm not sure how I found this book--it's actually a bunch of Kindle Singles pulled together in one volume.  It's one of the most interesting, creative stories I've read in a long time. It has a great action plot, but also does a good job of pulling you into the characters' lives.  And this author has written a ton of other stories, that are also really good.  I would definitely give this story a try. I promise you won't be disappointed.
B00004RFCM|5.0|My daughter had been wanting to complete her collection and the price was right.  She now has her collection complete and I paid a fair price.  Win Win.
030758836X|2.0|I listened to the audiobook, which was very well read and actually, I think, that reading enhanced the quality of the book.  Gone Girl was quickly absorbing, and I eagerly anticipated what looked to be an extraordinary reading experience; something way superior to the usual fare at the bookstand. Then, without warning, about three-quarters of the way through, the plot and then the ending itself agonizingly went to hell before my very eyes, leaving me disappointed and feeling unfulfilled. Read the first half anyway.  The lead female character, particularly, is very interesting and I found her attitude, perceptiveness, and manner of speaking quite interesting and amusing.
B00013RC8O|3.0|My husband wanted to up grade his VCR tape to DVD. Unfortunatley, the quality of recording didn't change the quality of the movie.  He is a car guy and had to have it in his collection.
B0063IH60K|5.0|I like this version because it seems to be easy but I really am not that good at this game.
0061537969|5.0|Even if you aren't a dog lover, this book will touch your heart.  Truly one of the most enjoyable books I've read in a while. If you are a dog lover, it will be a treasure.
B0049P1VHS|5.0|The best show on TV; I would recommend it to anyone...well; not kids under 14. It is definately an adult program.
B00AQF8CJ0|5.0|u need to get the free one. its the same exact thing. ur just wasting ur money on HD. AWSOME GAME!!!!!!!! I &lt;3 IT!!!!!!!! ZEPTO LAB ROCKS.
B00APUYN0I|5.0|This movie was so much fun to watch. Halareous. Hope there is a sequel. Stay in and watch thus movie with your friend, husband, wife, or a favorite pet.  You won't be disappointed.
B00AE2J93I|5.0|really fun movie for the family, There is some adult humor that the little ones will overlook. We all loved it!
B004222UCS|3.0|This is Tony iommi's first solo album<br />he wanted to release the album under his own name, not BLACK SABBATH<br />but the record company wouldn't allow it and insisted that Tony still used the BLACK SABBATH name<br />this info is in the Liner notes booklet in this Deluxe edition<br /><br />well this is my least favourite Black sabbath album which is actually Tony iommi's first solo album<br />Disc one is the original album which has 9 tracks all Digitally remastered and sound very Good<br />not all tracks are Great in my opinion<br />mainly cause Glenn hughes is lead vocalist on this album which i'm not a big fan of<br />the rest of the band are excellent of course, Eric singer on Drums, Dave spitz on Bass and Geoff nicholls (keys)<br /><br />in my opinion only half the album is really Good the rest of the tracks are average<br /><br />but every Black sabbath fan will have opinions on certain Black sabbath albums<br />that some of their albums are way better recorded and produced than other Black sabbath albums<br />and it also depends who's the vocalist aswell<br />theres the Tony martin albums and the 3 Ronnie James Dio albums,<br />Heaven and Hell, Mob rules and Dehumanizer which are fantastic albums<br /><br />and then theres this album seventh star with Glenn hughes singing<br />so as i said every Black sabbath fan will have opinions on this album anyway<br /><br />Disc 2 is a Live concert at the Hammersmith odeon London 1986<br /><br />the only 2 tracks from the seventh star album is Danger zone and seventh star title track<br />the rest of the songs are repeated old sabbath classics<br />but with Glenn hughes on vocals, so i didn't think much of this LIVE CD<br />but the LIVE recording is excellent, it's radio broadcast pro soundboard recording<br /><br />so this Black sabbath seventh star Deluxe edition<br />is only worth the money if you're a big fan/Huge fan of Glenn hughes and love his vocals<br />and also the booklet inside the package which explainsthe making of the album<br />which is very informative.<br /><br />so for me this album was a waste of money cause i only liked some of the tracks<br />and is only recommended for hardcore Glenn Hughes fans<br />That's all i can say about this seventh star album
B00AQ3K8IU|5.0|I was up until 4 am this morning reading Hopeless, could not put it down!!!!<br /><br />Colleen Hoover's 3rd book was not a disappointment and lived up to my standards that were set after I read Slammed and Point of No Retreat, her first two books.<br /><br />Loved it!
B004222UC8|4.0|This is the first Black sabbath album to feature Tony martin on vocals<br /><br />Disc one is the original album released 1987 and every track sounds excellent and Tony iommi still plays excellent<br />the rest of the band at the time of this album Eric singer (Drums) and Bob Daisley on Bass are excellent aswell.<br /><br />Disc two has the Ray Gillen sessions<br />ray Gillen was the vocalist who singing for the band for a year i think but then he left<br />and Tony martin was brought in to sing, this info is in the liner notes of this Deluxe edition package<br />Disc one is Digitally remastered and sounds excellent<br /><br />But Different production on the Ray Gillen sessions than the Tony martin version<br />the Ray Gillen tracks sound like Demo versions of the finished album with Tony martin<br /><br />but it's up to you, if your a big fan of Ray Gillen then you'll enjoy Disc two<br />if your not then Just listen to Disc one<br />and the Liner notes booklet is excellent tells the whole story of the making of the album<br />and the reasons why Ray Gillen left and why Tony martin came in to sing<br /><br />forget the old cd releases of Eternal idol this Deluxe edition is definitely worth the money<br /><br />so if your a hardcore black sabbath fan and if you like Tony martin on vocals<br />then buy this Eternal idol Deluxe edition release.
B008OHV4PG|5.0|Can't imagine anyone not seeing the national treasure that resides in Neil Young's music and voice.  Live long, old man!
B002VQ7PVS|2.0|Not a very suspenseful book, had to force myself to finish it.  The daughter's story had no purpose except as an avenue to tell her mother's story, so, needles to say, the characters in her life were irrelevant, annoying, pointless.  The mother's story was somewhat predictable, not too surprising. I felt like I was constantly reading about changing buses or walking routes to avoid being followed or Eva and Romers love trysts.  It would have been interesting to find out more about Romer, how he came into his normal, upperclass life after killing everyone else and the war was over.  After all the killing he did, for him to kill himself in the end was too simple a way to end the book, a let down.  The description/write-up of the book was much more exciting than the book itself.
B008XG1X18|5.0|love this app...great if you are a pinterest addict like myself! i love being able to look up pins for recipes when im in a store in case i forgot to write something down
B004EKCNMA|5.0|Animation is gorgeous. Dialogue, I believe, is all or mostly from Dickens' story, so it's not modernized or dumbed down. Jim Carrey does a great job, as do the rest of the mostly UK-born cast.
B007MS5B6Q|5.0|i bought this for my boyfriend for christmas, and he bought me one too! we are keeping both, very awesome for collectors, love love love!
B00A3NQNUU|5.0|Dragonvale is the best app for  taking care of babies and raising babies. That way once you're 30or something and you have a baby you'll know exactly what to do!

B0091THDOM|3.0|I was sent a defective case which was a nightmare. I left a bad review on Amazon and figured that would be the last I heard or thought about it, but I was wrong. Snugg representatives read my review and contacted me telling me that they had a defective batch of cases sent out and due to their lifetime warranty, they were going to send me a new case, free of charge. They went out of their way to make sure my needs were met and I got what I paid for.
B001EN71DQ|5.0|Good quality, neat packaging and case. Another generation is going to see this classic.  I am glad I bought this.
B003ZSJ212|5.0|I got this for my husband for Christmas.  He loves it.  It has tons of special features.  The only thing that would make this better is if it also had the DVDs so that we could watch in the car etc.
B0083SBMBM|3.0|I guess it takes someone interested in fantasy heroes to get through this DVD. That's not me, but my grandson thought it was a really good movie. I gave it an extra star for my grandson's interest in this DVD.
B000BW7QWW|5.0|This movie pulled all of the other series of Fire Fly together.  It was well written and acted.  Each character is fleshed out and their purpose with each other is fulfilled in this final movie.  I highly recommend it.
B001OQCV2E|2.0|I watched the entire movie and not only is it noisy the whole way through...you felt like this movie was in a hurry to end & a lot of the effects made the mission of survival look corny as heck, not to mention totally impossible. I guess it's a good enough sci-fi movie..but it wasn't worth a higher ranting. Was not impressed. And I love John Cusack...he's good in almoist any movie. I say, save your money...this ads for this video are all hype as there is little to back their claims up.
B0000AQS0F|5.0|Just a fantastic development of characters, great story lines and plenty of chair griping action.  Watch them in order and save Serenity for last.  Awesome.
B007ZGO7EM|4.0|This app is simple, easy to use &amp; free!  Thanks for putting it out there .  I am getting a great deal of use out of it.
0307593525|5.0|Julia Child. What more can you say???<br /><br />My late husband and I used to watch her show on repeats Saturday afternoons.  She was the funniest thing on TV.<br /><br />I bought this set as a &#34;pre-retirement gift&#34; to myself.  I've always wanted to be a better cook, and this is one of my goals for my retirement: to become a better and more adventurous cook.<br /><br />Bon Appetite!
B00AQ3K8IU|5.0|Phenomenal! Her best book yet! Full of romance and twists! This is definitely a must read :-) Hope she writes more about these characters!

B000IZ9UEY|5.0|This is not the best plot. But it is a guy flick and a good one to boot. Some awesome knife/hand to hand scenes.
B002VPE1B6|5.0|My late husband loved this movie.  I have no clue, except the people are blue.  When he misplaced the first copy I had to rush order another one.
B0054JZC6E|5.0|This app was worth downloading has a bunch of games that you can enjoy anytime. no need to wait get it today
B005LAIGLE|3.0|OK movie.  Maybe I'll watch it again when I'm not tired.  It didn't hold my interest as much as most of his movies do.  I'd have shot the brother-in-law in the first 5 minutes.
B009IEXKXI|4.0|This is great book.  I read it in just a few days after i was hook in the first chapter.  I would recommend this book to anyone who wants a great easy going scifi book.  I think this would be a great movie.  :)

B007FEFLTO|5.0|It's a great mix of storytelling and World War II history!  It makes the World War II years come to life.

B00973902K|4.0|This was the #50 song in Rolling stone magazines list of the 50 best songs of 2012.but interestingly enough made #1 on Amazons' customers favorites list of the 100 best songs of 2012 probably because it was the most downloaded and streamed song of the year.good pop tune.

B0018AK9RA|5.0|Judas Priest Nostradamus 5 star!<br /><br />If you're a \\"growler\\", \\"traditionalist\\" or can't get past the \\"old\\" Priest sound/style, this may not be your mug o'blood...<br /><br />I've savored this album since its release. I've set it aside for months, and regularly came back to it also. As with any complex artistic expression, it takes many takes and re-takes to grasp the subtleties, and this opus has the delicacy of character and meaning which will likely take years to fully absorb. The greats keep revealing their form long after their creation.<br /><br />The whole album is 5+... composition, texture, instrument placement, story, originality, quality, packaging, price. (I got the deluxe with all the goodies).<br /><br />Disc I is a solid 5 star with some songs exceeding expectation.<br /><br />Disc II wraps up strongly and exceeds any rating system.<br /> -- Finishes off leaving you wanting more!... -- 5 star, maybe about 9!<br /><br />Well Done Mr. Halford and Crew!<br /><br /> Few albums rate an excessive 5 star all the way through with 10 songs, let alone a double, 23 track, 102+ minute album.<br /><br />I've been a Rob Halford fan since the 80's -- Ironically Point of Entry -- and every project with which he is involved is worth exploring. However, Nostradamus may be the pinnacle of his 40 years of collaborations. One of the best concept albums of the last 20 years!<br /><br />If not listening from vinyl, but MP3 or the like, ensure at least a 0.1 to 0.2 crossfade (WMP). This album is a 102 min song. Breaks between reduce the experience.<br /> Interestingly, the etymology of vinyl is the Latin vinum = \\"wine\\". As with wine, this album will alter your senses.<br /><br />Judas Priest<br /> Rocka Rolla (1974)<br /> Sad Wings of Destiny (1976)<br /> Sin After Sin (1977)<br /> Stained Class (1978)<br /> Killing Machine (1978) (released as Hell Bent for Leather in the USA 1979)<br /> Unleashed in the East (1979)<br /> British Steel (1980)<br /> Point of Entry (1981)<br /> Screaming for Vengeance (1982)<br /> Defenders of the Faith (1984)<br /> Turbo (1986)<br /> Priest...Live!

B009XY97VC|5.0|A lovely, energizing album! There are a few songs I don't care for (Back to Earth, geeehhhk) but they're infinitely outweighed by the pulse-rising For the Win or the eponymous Skyworld. Recommended for all trailer/cinema soundtrack lovers out there. Just buy it.<br /><br />I actually sit and crotchet while listening to this - gets the hook goin'!
B009VB7P6G|5.0|This movie is very entertaining for all ages.  Tinkerbell has a lot of spunk.  Her sister Periwinkle is the sweetest character you would enjoy on film.  The entire family should watch this together.

0060245867|5.0|All of Laura Joffe Numeroff's childrens books are exceptional, but this is probably my favorite.  Kids love the innocent determination of this curious little mouse.  Have a plate of chocolate chip cookies on hand while you're reading it!

B003KK65KG|5.0|Jodi Picoult takes a situation and views it from all angles, she draws the reader in with twists and characters that are easy to relate to - whether we love them, despise them, understand them or eventually pity them.<br /><br />A great story about un recognised and un resolved bullying.
B004AQR24W|5.0|My wife hates this movie. Therefore it has automatically become the best movie of the year.  There are some great throw back lines that had me on the floor laughing.
B005CRQ4GU|1.0|The book was about Greg Heffley want a date to the Valentine dance but he can't find a girl. So he keeps  on looking when he asked Rowley to be his Coleman to help him get a date.Then Rowley said that a girl named Abigail just broke up with her date.
B005K0HDGE|5.0|I loved this book. It kept me interested and was different. I was almost disappointed when it ended since I wanted to read more! I'd suggest this book to someone who enjoys Stephen King as well as a suspense book. GREAT!
B008P1EWIM|5.0|I really like the weather on this app.  It's nice to be able  to look  at  inside out of the weather..<br />I use it a lot. I would give it a 10'
B001KOFH2G|3.0|Movie is very good. wish they would make alot more! Goof film, good acting, good directing! everything you want in a SI Fi
B00005JKG9|3.0|Maybe I was expecting to much as I've heard from many people how great this movie was.  It had superb acting by Jack Lemmon but other than that it dragged quite a bit.
034580404X|5.0|I loved reading all 3 books, couldn't put them down. I looked at it as a great love story. I will read them again.
B003YL4LYI|5.0|I believe this one is better than a couple of the other Game of Thrones books. I haven't finished it yet, but it's definitely holding my interest! Hope book 6 comes out by the time I'm done with this one!
B008TRUDAS|5.0|I started out by reading Hopless by colleen which I LOVED, which led me to Slammed. The relationship in this book are incredible. I highly recommended
B00APUYWYA|5.0|How many kids got a job in a movie for this one? Hundreds, at least. They deserve those jobs as much as I deserve to enjoy a movie that has them in it. And dammit, I deserved this movie.<br /><br />We'd like to see them more often, but they only come along once in a while.<br /><br />This is the kind of movie you'd recommend by saying: \\"...even if you think you're going to hate it, watch it anyways, you'll be pleasantly surprised.\\"<br /><br />When's the sequel?
B00886XQO0|5.0|Ho scelto questa valutazione x far capire quanto sono ottime queste cuffie :) e consiglio a tutti gli interessati di comprarle.
B0098WWEH8|4.0|After high expectations following Veckatimest, many fans and hipsters were maybe expecting the something instantly mind-blowing, but there is little candy in this course. So, on first listen, the reaction is, &#34;meh.&#34; After repeated listens you begin to appreciate the range of flavors and their juxtaposition. With lyrics laden with emotion, the album leaves you quite satiated.
B00A11AN6O|5.0|5GB cloud drive is plenty of space for all documents and photos,especially when it is free of charge! The cloud drive is easy to access under Amazon account features and the selection process is a breeze!
B000VDDDVO|5.0|I watch this movie at least once a year.  I still get choked up.  I loaned my copy to someone and never got it back.  I was very pleased to get the original black and white version, in addition to the colorized version.  I also enjoyed the special features with interviews with Frank Capra and Jimmy Stewart, which I had not seen before.  Bert and Ernie!  Sheldon and Leonard!
B008FYZIVY|5.0|Excellent.  Price was okay.  I am sure that I will watch all again.  I am also certain that other fans of this series would enjoy too.
B005SFR7YE|5.0|I watched this live on PBS several years ago and loved it.  I bought a copy for myself as well as three of my other relatives for Christmas this year.  They all loved it!  Would buy from this seller again!<br /><br />If you like the Phantom and the music then this is a no brainer and a must have!
B003JTHXOK|4.0|This book is great. Keeps you wondering what will happen. Don't read a lot but couldn't put it down and read it in three days.
B0086700CM|5.0|This game is so good! I love it. It gives me something to do when I'm bored! Give it a try!!
B007SYWFRM|5.0|I love this game to pieces.its wonderful.what i dont like is that you dont win enough acorns to buy everything.

B002MQYOFW|5.0|Amazing book! Loved every minute  of it!!! KEPT MY ATTENTION THE whole  TIME! Would recommend this to everyone,! Wonderful series!
0920236162|5.0|This was a favorite of my children when they were young, and I look forward to reading it to my grandchildren. Elizabeth is a marvelously brave and clever heroine. And the story isn't just for kids. I did it as a puppet show for a group of theater graduate students, and they loved it!
B004H1V5RU|5.0|This puzzle is for adults or very late teens with lots of patience.  Those that tried it, liked it.  No one finished it quickly.  It proved to be a challenge for all.
B009IJJ5B4|5.0|Having seen both versions of Danny Boyle's Frankenstein with Miller and Cumberbatch alternating the roles of Monster and Maker, it is fascinating that this pair now have competing versions of a modern Sherlock Holmes. I have not finished all of the Elementary episodes, so I am not ready to choose a favorite. That being said, I do find Miller's Holmes well done. He introduces some new features of a Holmes personality. Knowing how to manipulate social situations (dinner with Watson's family) and having a taste for revenge that if visceral and not just cerebral. While the idea of a female Watson creates some new twists for the subplot of the relationship between these two, I fear that this may lead to some shortcomings if the series goes on too long.
B003CSV7TK|5.0|Certain movies have kind of become a tradition in our family.  We always watch &#34;Christmas Vacation&#34; on Thanksgiving night, then between Thanksgiving and Christmas we always fit in &#34;Christmas Carol&#34; (1939 Version), &#34;It's a Wonderful Life&#34;, &#34;Miracle on 34th Street&#34; and &#34;A Charlie Brown Christmas&#34;.  It wouldn't be the Christmas season without them.
B0071XO8RA|5.0|Hello! My name is Ron Swanson. In general I try never to speak with people, but I have been reading this Wool thing and it's damn good. You should buy it.<br /><br />Son, you should know that my recommendation is essentially a guarantee. Read this. Now.

0765325950|1.0|You choose to give me the middle finger and not release MoL as an ebook, I exercise my right to give one back to you with a one star review. I keep one in reserve for those trolls that feel it necessary to flame me and those that agree with me on this matter. RJs Bestseller List legacy is protected. Harriet's one star legacy begins.
B000W4KT64|5.0|I loved this movie.  If you ever watched American Bandstand with Dick Clark back in the 60's and enjoyed it ;this movie is for you. Blacks were not allow on tv; but in Hairspray there was Negro day on it version of &#34;American Band Stand&#34; when an over weight girl show up to dance the action starts as she is booted away from the show.  Reality dances in at the end that life is just not black and white.  Or I should say all white?  At any rate the DVD remake comes in clear and it's a movie that one can watch over and over again.
B008Y1YK9Y|3.0|Based on my own opinion, I thought the movie was okay but not as good as the first two.  However, I liked the story behind it with a tremendous ending, and one I did like.  The Seller sent this movie to me in excellent condition and in a timely manner.  Would purchase from this Seller again if the occasion arose.
6305433909|5.0|Whoopi Goldberg is back with nuns; but this time she is helping out teenagers and saving the high school from closing down.  The music is awesome and it's an inspirational movie to &#34;wake up and be somebody&#34;
B005544V6A|4.0|Not a &#34;must watch&#34; show, but it is entertaining enough to keep watching. Will watch the next seasons at my leisure
B002NZK5TG|3.0|This is a movie that will stand the test of time.  The movie is entertaining and the music is good (by the Four Tops) but beware of the ending too much cursing.
B00A9V2JSG|5.0|I really enjoyed this book. The writing is beautiful and very poetic. I love the main character, Lena. She goes through such a transition through this book. I can't wait to keep going on this literary adventure.
B00AQ3K8IU|4.0|Definitely a younger book, but still a page turner. I read this and then gave it to my teenager to read! We both agree that the plot is very different and couldn't put the book down after the first 50 pages!
B00AMBH70S|2.0|To give it some bonus points, the Bourne Legacy had some very successful action sequences. But that's about all. Jeremy Renner was unconvincing, and Rachel Weis was just as forced. Edward Norton tried to make the most of his contribution to the film, but with a story line as contrived and hard to follow as the Bourne Legacy was, he couldn't lift this film out of its poorly thought out plot. It is an unfortunate follow up to a fairly successful trilogy of entertaining films.
B005OHSR0E|5.0|The book sparks imagination and as a bonus us interactive with flaps to lift on every page. My 3 and 5 year old granddaughters loved this book
B005HSG3VK|4.0|This is a great case for protecting your Kindle.  It has a nice feel to it and fits the Kindle well.  The only downside is that the inside of it attracts dog hairs.  It's not that big of a deal, and I would buy this case again.
B009WO7NQO|5.0|My boys love playing Angry Birds Stars Wars.  The only part I don't like is that you have to buy the falcons in order to win some of the levels.
B00A9X9ORI|5.0|Great action and suspense.<br />I like the new guy. Big future for him.  He has 1960s good looks and chafm
0374275637|3.0|The first 3/4 of the book (300 pages) are worth reading, and contain interesting facts (not quite surprising or new, but interesting nevertheless). The last 100 are pretty redundant in content, and what's more troubling, it's full with math mistakes that appear obvious to anyone with some expertise in the field of probabilities.<br /><br />Anyway it's interesting to see the experiments the author proposes and \\"measure\\" to some extent how vulnerable you are to different bias, and a thoughful reading provides tools for fighting them as much as possible.
B008Y2FRFO|5.0|this tests your ability to strategize. learn where to place the coins for the best reward.<br />just try to beat me.
B009JZTOG8|5.0|awesome show! yes recommend this show to anyone. my 10 year old also enjoys it! Enjoy watching with the family.
B000000W71|3.0|Pretty good-some of my favorite songs on it. There are also a few song that I did not care for. Still love that guitar!
B008G12ERC|5.0|The best music I have heard in sooooo many years.......................makes me wander why,  enough words,<br />I am no longer allowed to speak with my mouth, and neither in dream synthesis
B0067TGSOK|5.0|Lots of ideas about easy entry businesses and how to launch and grow.  I was able to immediately impliment many of the ideas.
B008JGSM6G|5.0|This app not only got me hooked but my daughter too.  Of course,  now she is much better than I am.
B0044XV3QY|5.0|The extended version includes scenes that definitely add to the story.  For example, just what happened that betrayed omitacaya people.  Also, more scenes of native wildlife and culture.  Altho, the Bluray version isn't that much better in quality than the DVD version.  Better menu functions, but that's about it.
B006LSZECO|5.0|Well written, great characters, great plot, fast moving story. highly recommend reading this book. Six more words are required. Thanks
B005LAIIQC|5.0|The plot thickens.  Blackbriar is just  the tip of the iceberg.  I like the way they include current technology like the effectiveness of drones and the applications of &#34;viral weaponry&#34;.  Bourne gets a mention, but Jason does not make an appearance.  You can tell there will be more sequels.  Great movie to buy because you will want to watch it again and again.
6302158095|5.0|This is a classic! It is still as wonderful as I remember it.  Very happy I got this for my child to enjoy.
B00884GR0W|1.0|its mineceaft with confusing grafics mineble glowing greenness spawners and stupid quests like I need to bile a bout go get me wood its controls r impossible and it over all stonks
B00AK0X5VQ|5.0|This game is so cool...unique...and yes....relaxing!  This app is a great break from the fast pace of life.  It is just like you are drifting around  the universe interacting with all the other bodies in space.  Very cool distraction and very addicting.  May also help insomnia....lol
B005LAII12|5.0|What can I say, my husband loves this movie so I had to get it. Came perfectly packaged, on time and no problems.
030758836X|4.0|I enjoyed this book.  I do not want to give away too much because I hate spoilers but this book has all sorts of characters that are just not likable. As the plot develops the characters get stripped of their layers and nothing is as it seems.  you know that right from the first two chapters but you are not prepared for how it will go and the language of the book is unique to say the least.  Analogies that you might not expect to see are used, and it's like the author has a way of describing things, everyday things with a vivid and often slightly unpleasant twist which fits this book very well.  I will have to get her other books to read because i did enjoy this book a great deal.
B0027MJU00|5.0|I absolutely adore Gillian Flynn. Her writing is captivating and engrossing, yet substantive and worthwhile (if that makes sense). Fast paced or engrossing thrillers often feel like fast food. It feels good going down, but once you're done you're feeling a little off and wish you hadn't gone through that drive through. With Gillian Flynn you get the experience of an exciting thriller, yet she crafts a novel with characters worth remembering and thinking about.<br /><br />I have read all of her novels, and feel that she gets better with each one. Having catapulted to wide acclaim for Gone Girl, I am hoping that her first two novels will receive attention as well. Dark Places is one of my all time favorites. It's deep and rich and dark and twisted. It is compelling in its descent into darkness as you read each chapter, getting closer to the end. And the end does not disappoint.<br /><br />Gillian Flynn always finds a way to take something we know and turn into something unexpected. She's a fantastic author and I cannot wait for her future works.
148126477X|5.0|Got a free copy of this with my kindle and even though its taken me almost a year to get around to reading it I'm so glad I did. I fell in love with Elizabeth, Darcy and the whole gang all over again.
B0055PGUYU|4.0|I gave this book 4 out of 5 stars because it was engaging and actually taught me new ways of thinking about why I do the things I do.  I learned about my own habits and gained insight about how to replace them with new habits.  The majority of the book focused on historical examples in business and society about why some habits are or are not affective.  In spite of this rating, I found the entire book ended rather abruptly and I would have liked a larger selection that gave ideas on changing habits.  I would recommend this book to anyone who wants to learn more about themselves, counselors, pastors and teachers.
B000VBJEEG|5.0|Ratatouille is a superb movie! It fits perfect in my rat/mouse collection of over 1800 non living rats or mice.
B00A80SHFM|1.0|As a massive fan of the show (yes I have actually seen it 513 times over the last 23 years) I was looking forward to a fabulous interpretation for the movie, but for some reason Tom Hooper and the other creatives seem to have elected to go back to the book for inspiration. At least 25% of the lyrics have been changed with some songs and scenes being entirely revised, moved or even omitted.<br /><br />At least half of the new or revised material is not required and the decision to use Russell Crowe as Javert is one of the worst choices in both musical and cinema history. And do not even get me started about how amateur the filming looks using hand-held cameras, out of focus shots as the actors move around outside of the control of the camera personnel. It is clear why Tom Hooper is not being nominated for any awards; this is the man who helped to make one of, in my opinion, best films created in 'The king's speech.' Has he actually seen the show on stage?<br /><br />Now I have got the main rant out of my system let me talk about the music and highlights CD. Although prosessing a fine voice, Hugh seems to have been miscast as Valjean. He would have been outstanding as Javert and they should have let John Owen Jones take on the role for which he was born (check out the 25th anniversary production live recording for an example of the great man's work). Samantha Barks demonstrates fabulously how the talented former cast members would have made this film fly! Eddie Redmayne is the find of the film and should be snapped up to appear in the stage version immediately. Do not get me on the subject of the Thenardiers; Sacha doing \\"Master of the house\\" in a french accent scraps the bottom of the barrel!<br /><br />What was the point of the actors singing live? OK it helps not to limit the performance on the day, but wouldn't it have been better to dub the songs after principle filming? There are already sections of the film (and soundtrack) where this is used and it brings a much crisper effect. Also something could have been done about Russell.<br /><br />If you want to see how to do a musical on film, the brilliant 'my fair lady' is the perfect example. The more recent take on Andrew Lloyd Webber's 'Phantom' (another show with Sir Cameron's excellent guidance) is also worth the name. Unfortunately they have taken a lot of the heart, passion and rhythm out of the musical in my humble opinion.<br /><br />I never thought I would ever say this, but I can not recommend either the film or the soundtrack to anyone.[[ASIN:B00418NWZW Les Miserables 2010 Cast]]
B008YWY0HK|5.0|Great movie. Saw in theater and it is just as good at home. Don't need 7 more words to tell how great it is!
B00ATDOVNK|5.0|Game is quite challenging! It is a combination of hidden object, strategy, and adventure. Animation is good and sound . Is great!  If you are wishing  to kill sometime get this game!
B005LAJ17M|5.0|Received it in 2-days and was very satisfied! Highly recommend the series to watch and can't wait for the next one to come out!
B0096MM9GG|5.0|this game is just like the xbox ver! fun levels, fun game! this is the best! get it!<br /><br />ps. the game is hard at first but if you keep playing you good.
B004XJRQUQ|5.0|This trilogy was very satisfying. I heard so many mixed reviews but it turned out that the books were very entertaining. If you like suspense with a bit of romance thrown in this is a must read.
B00AIQP9DE|2.0|the game Dark Arcana the carnival was pretty cool until it froze up on me.  The  screen went black and never would open up and play again.  That sucked.
B0034G4P80|3.0|How can so many brilliant people get together and make such a fiasco? I could only take about 20 minutes of the eye-popping special effects before I started shutting down. All I ask is for are some  real characters I can care about, a reasonably, lively creative script, and some kind of slightly original story. Maybe I shouldn't criticize because I did only do most of the exposition, but I could see pretty clearly where this baby was going: right down the drain on a multi-million dollar thrill ride. Not even masterful actors like Hopkins can save messes like these. Compare him in this to what he did to us in Silence of the Lambs. Well, there are movies, and then there are just films. Maybe Hollywood should declare a moratorium on special effects for a spell. You can throw all the perfume in the world on a pig, but he's still going to stink.
B000FVQLQQ|4.0|This movie is wonderful at depicting the difference between true genius and basic intellect. While most of Russell Crowe's colleagues very intelligent, they are unable to push and expand their field to extent that he did so well. At the same time, the movie did a great job of contrasting his struggle with basic social skills and attitudes. The movie also illuminated an internal struggle of the mind when it works against itself.
B008JGSM6G|5.0|&lt;3 &lt;3 &lt;3 !!!!!! this is a fun, challenging time killer. I was immediately hooked. Easy enough for small children too.
B000FBFM9S|5.0|This novel has it all -- great characters, characters of all types from many races and social strata, humor, pathos, social commentary (between the lines), great writing. Makes me think we're in the 21st century and the world is very different than it was during the previous three thousand years.
1469984202|5.0|Loved this book. I was on vacation while is was reading this, and I couldn't put it down. Would recommend this to anyone.
B0084U0IEG|2.0|The narrator talks endlessly about herself, her work, her friends and there is no action to speak of. I'm not going to finish this one. Atonement was great, not this one. Sorry, tried to like it.
B007HACDLK|5.0|The CIA asassin does it again. He is the muscle and the brains. Always a great read and page turner
B00AYQNOU8|5.0|If you are into spirituality, photography, travel, music, and beautiful, ultra-high quality and amazing imagery mixed with the beginnings, middles, and ends of civilization and life itself, watch it. Worth it. 7 day rental- watch it more than once.
B007SGLZP8|1.0|This novel was an immense disappointment. Having read many of Grisham`s books, I can honestly say that the storyline was difficult to follow and was more than just a bit preposterous. His novels based more in reality are a much better read.
B008HK3XU4|5.0|I like this product. It is very convenient. and very good design. Price was very reasonable too. So I recommend it.
B008XG1X18|5.0|I love using this app on my kindle fire! Some inconsistencies here and there, but mostly a reliable Pinterest app.
B00AB0AR2U|4.0|Basically, you're a fan of these or you're not.  If you are not, you can stop reading now.  If you are, this is another solid entry in the series.  Fun with good action sequences.
B003JTHXOK|5.0|Wonderful yet again by Mr. SPARKS! An easy and relaxing read!  Finished in one day and wish it was longer or a sequel
B009HEJXFS|5.0|we enjoyed this one more than MIBII. Josh Bolin was great and Tommy Lee Jones (as always) had great lines.
B009X01FJS|1.0|This case is definitely NOT worth the price!! All your paying for is the pretty colors. Honestly, if your looking for something to protect your already expensive kindle I BEG YOU  just get the Otterbox. Just last night I dropped my kindle while it was in THIS case and my entire screen looks like a spider web now and kindle insurance doesn't cover drops and you can't replace the screen they make you replace the entire kindle for a $47 discount. Or u can buy a refurbished kindle at a discounted price. It doesn't matter that I paid $300 when it first came out or that I got a $65 case to protect it or that I spend an ungodly amount of money on Amazon.com a year they want you to replace the whole kindle. So please take this into consideration while deciding on a good case to buy.
B0072KZ0Z6|5.0|Being a New Girl series addict. I love having the first season on dvd to watch anytime the feeling happens.
B00AKS656U|5.0|A very very fun game all the levels are challenging but very fun and brings back memories of the old game
B009SJ3GUK|5.0|I can't wait for season 3 to see how the story changes. Jessica Lange is awesome as Sister Jude/Judy Martin...awesome!
B005LAIH2W|5.0|How could anyone give this movie a bad review, other than the lackluster name given to this film?  I have watched this movie 6 times, amnd it still catures the immagination.  I love this film!  I sure wuished I wouold have seen it the box office but the name just didn't strike an interest.  Maybe they should have named it \\"Barsoom\\" or \\"The Thurns Arrive\\" or some other mysterious name.  The title \\"John Carter\\" just doesn't cut it.  It's just not an interesting name. I thought I must live in a cave since I really didn't see much marekting on this film.  I have seen other comments on this as well, so I guess it's not just me.<br /><br />What amazes me the most is that the critics gave this film bad reviews.  I wonder what they were thinking?  This film is pure magic! It grabs you from the beginning to the very end of the film, and still leaves you wanting more.
B001O6W9QC|4.0|Another Stiller gem. It is filled with the same antics that keep me coming back to him for entertainment. Not only that he brings in the entire clan of Hollywood favorites to add their touch. Four stars in no  way takes away from teh entertainment value; I save 5 stars for truly artistic masterpieces on the level of Pulp Fiction.<br />A must see for anyone who likes to let go of reality.
B00AQ3K8IU|4.0|This book is very good. A bit tough to read especially for survivors of sexual abuse, so be warned. The reason I gave it four stars is because I felt like some of the things that happened were unrealistic.
0765325950|5.0|I started reading the Wheel of Time shortly after the release of The Eye of the World. By the time I had finished The Dragon Reborn, the Wheel of Time had become my most favorite series of fictional books ever written. Almost 20 years after finishing  the Dragon Reborn, I still believe that The Wheel of Time is the best and greatest series of fictional novels ever written!!!<br />A Memory of Light was awesome, and I loved reading every word, every line, and every page. I loved that a few of my theories were right, but I was also very happy to be surprised by much of the developments and plot lines with A Memory of Light.<br /><br />This book is truly an Epic ending to the Wheel of Time. A Memory of Light will certainly be re-read by me and countless other WOT fans for years and years and years.
B003TSEEDY|4.0|Hated how it ended. Did really understand why he was in the hospital or what ended up happening with sam
1401937519|5.0|I was very interested...Great Readiing!! I saw Anita on TV and I knew I had to read this book. It was difficult to put it down.
B0069G5Z9K|5.0|my kids and I play this for hours. it is so much fun to change up his outfits and actions. the challenges keep it entertaining.
B00622B3MY|5.0|It was a good movie - fun and action-packed.  We plan on watching it again very soon.  Cars with a 007 twist.
B007SGM084|4.0|My yardstick is whether I care about how it's going to turn out and whether I like the characters. In this instance, Ana and Christian took turns getting on my nerves but the story was still interesting enough to keep reading and find out what would happen next. I liked that it wasn't predictable.
B0058VW36U|5.0|I love this game. You actually use your brain to figure out how to cut the ropes. I will recommend it.
B0002HWJY6|3.0|MUCH SMALLER than I expected.  I bought it because I had also bought the Smurfs 3D 6 figure set, and thought it would be a place to store these little figures.  Well, they would not all fit.  Also, I don't understand why they didn't make the roof to snap on.  They could easily have made the roof to stay on, and it would have been a much better product.
B009RI4FRU|4.0|This DVD is an edited version of the movie shown at the movie theater.  There are scenes which have been eliminated which is not desirable.
B004GXL8GC|5.0|The Smurfs are really cute, and exactly what we expected them to be.  My granddaughter was excited to get them.
B008JGSM6G|4.0|This is a straight forward puzzle solving game. It has bright neon like colors that are fun to look at.
B00A8ECU24|5.0|This game is the best game I've ever played in my life!!!!!! I would absolutely recommend this game to a friend!!!
B0056C6XIA|1.0|Finish quality wasn't what I expected....it wasn't tight fit and it was far less of quality than other Bear Grylls multitool that I have for less $$$$.
B003ODIZL6|5.0|Works great for me and filled all of my need would recommend this to anyone that needed help with words
B00A3NQNUU|4.0|I just started playing this, but thus far it seems to be fairly entertaining.  I am lookingbforward to see what dragrons come of breeding...
B00AQ3K8IU|5.0|Great book.  It had me in tears by the end.  It is sad, lovely, good, exciting and anything but hopeless.
B00637HXNG|5.0|Saw this concert live in 2012, sound was not that good at the venue, but the show rocked.  If you like the Scorpions, save the ticket money and get the 3D Disc.  Great sound and video; better than live.
B00280LYIC|4.0|It was a good book. I enjoyed reading. I recommend this book. If you like the series you will love this book
B009B4ZEMA|3.0|the vocals were a little softer than what i'm used to hearing from christina, but it wasn't a bad album especially since i only had to spend $5 for the download
B00AE9UYJ4|5.0|I love this game so much I keep on playing it.I even played for a entire day! Buy it! It's scary
B005Q1W10A|5.0|If you are like me & love books, movies, & shows from this time. You will LOVE this show. And it's so good this season. I'm ready for season 3! ADDICTED!
B000VYX8PE|5.0|When I first started reading &#34;tha bad begining&#34; I thought I wouldn't like it. But when I started reading it a little more i just couldn't stop. I read it in two days.<br /><br />You shouldn't put this book down at first.
B005ZOBNOI|4.0|A reminder that a strong, healthy body is a gift. The characters eloquently faced their battles the universe handed them. Painfully honest and real.
B009YP9L7U|4.0|i think this book was a creative but cliche ...in its beginning it started off strong but as it reached it end it got rushed and that what bring  the book down..
B005CRQ4OW|2.0|I loved this book even my kids enjoyed it.  Madcass my daughter loves it she will console read it love it
B00AQ3K8IU|5.0|That's exactly how I felt reading this book. It captures every facet of your emotions and leaves you wanting more. My heart aches, yet rejoices. My head hurts from crying so much, but my heart is swollen. This is by far one of the best novels I've read in a very long time. Kudos!
B004QKNXIQ|5.0|Cute kids movie with some adult humor. The singing was decent and it wa a good spin on an old story.
B003YL4LYI|3.0|After 3 brilliant installations, the last two disappoint. Hopefully the final two will return the series to the original pedestal it once had.
B008YI91HS|5.0|My son just saw this movie for the first time, Even with its age he was totally wrapped up in it and practically hid under couch pillows when the T-rex roared. He loved it.
B002RV01QI|1.0|I heard one of the songs as I was getting a scan of my kidneys. I guess it was supposed to be soothing. It was, so I bought the CD. Now I want to kill myself when I hear it. THE most depressing thing I've ever heard. Boring, boring, boring. New Age crap.
B006CHML4I|4.0|i was very glad to receive this watch-it was 2 days and not special shipping! Thanks AMAZON.  I have always been a fan of Seiko Watches for everyday type wearing-this didn't disappoint- well built-all although I would have liked it a little bit bigger maybe ?-but still the quality of the construction { the Cloth belt is enforced with leather at the holes for securing it to the arm-is a nice touch }. the face is very readable - and well I just like the look of it.
B000SEHG5U|5.0|This book reaffirmed my belief that I'm not the only person who doesn't believe. There is no monster under the bed, there is no boogeyman in the closet, and there is no supreme being floating in the sky.. Dawkins is a literate genius. God bless him....oops.
B002ZBN13A|5.0|They have a great sound of their own and it is awesome to listen to! I would definitey suggest this album...
B008SOS63S|5.0|Pure genius. I have played guitar for years, and I've seen all the greats from Hendrix to Page, to Santana and Clapton. I've never heard anyone as good as Bonamassa. Buy the CD's buy the DVD's. Go see him live. A musical experience you should not miss.
B0083EW97W|5.0|Really like this . It has a stripped down homey feel to the music . Something like Olivia is awesome and kicky !
B0063IH60K|4.0|I love anything solitaire. Only thing is I would like to see auto complete start automatically instead of asking when you get to that point especially in a timed game.
044654146X|5.0|Israel, has always fascinated me. I went there on a holiday trip last year (2011) and started to see many developments and solutions they have created in different fields: solar energy, irrigation, IT development, agriculture and so on. So when I came across this book, I knew I had to have it in order to understand, how a young country (60 years) have surpassed older countries that posses vast natural resources and that there are not in a constant fight for survivor.<br /><br />This book is very easy to read. The authors portraits Israel from its beginnings and what they have done to be where they are right now with examples and without getting into much technical and economical terms.<br /><br />They have a long road ahead, but what they understand and its intrinsic in his culture is to keep innovation and coming up with solutions. Failure is not seen as something bad, but instead a learning experience that is encouraged.<br /><br />Excellent book. Applies both to the businesses and to the individual...
B004SJ3BCI|5.0|I actually find myself rocking as the bird flies across the trajectory! Love anything of angry birds!  Now on to piggies!
B00A8ECU24|5.0|I love this game! It's really fun. I recommend you get it if you enjoy the show. The only thing is you have to go to options if you want to get out and hearts are hard to get. Other than that, it's wonderful!
B004FP1WX0|5.0|This was such a well-done documentary that keeps you going the whole time. I don't want to give a way the ending, but there's a shocking twist and your heart will definitely be touched.
B0097GVJWQ|4.0|Interesting story and fun gameplay. Challenging puzzles but not impossible to solve. Good buy.<br />Can't wait for the next one!
0765325950|5.0|I'm about 1/3 of the way through the book and am enjoying it so far.  The build-up to this has been coming for over a decade and over thousands and thousands of pages, so I expect that there will be some let downs.  I know I will be sad when I reach the end and have to say goodbye to these wonderful characters.<br /><br />The main reason I'm writing this review is because of all the one-star reviews.  Every one of you rating this book as one-star because there's no initial release of an e-book should be ashamed of yourselves, very ASHAMED of yourselves.  You're no better than a 5-year old that throws a temper tantrum because Christmas won't get here soon enough.  In addition, all of you are disgracing the memory of Robert Jordan who has given all of us hours and hours of pleasure, thrills, excitements, and unforgettable characters and landscapes.  If you've enjoyed his books enough to make it to the last battle, then you are despicable to come here and trample over Robert Jordan's gift, his brilliantly-woven tapestry of a world, story, and people.  It is clear that taking up Jordan's mantle and finishing the book was a task that would have been daunting to any author.  Sanderson, while I disagree with some of his decisions, has done a brilliant and admirable job to get us all to the last battle after Jordan lost his too soon.  I simply don't know how Sanderson has managed to complete this epic AND simultaneously write some of the most creative fantasy fiction on the market today.  Yet because you can't have the e-book right away, you decide to take out your displeasure by kicking Sanderson in the face with your childish demands that the world exist to please you.  Without Jordan and without Sanderson you would never have even heard of Tarmon Gai'don or now finally made it there.<br /><br />I, for one, cherish this gift given by Jordan and Sanderson and sincerely apologize for the fact that some of their fan base consists of immature brats.
0792164903|4.0|If you're a fan if Johnny Dep, I am, then you'll enjoy this movie since he's ever bit as endearing as most of the characters he plays under the directorship of Tim Burton.  He plays constable I. Crane who is sent from NY upstate to investigate the murders of three people in the little village of Sleepy Hollow by Christopher Lee in a very small cameo.  He comes equipped with a whole lot of theory and some strange contraptions, more charm, and some baggage from childhood that wakens in Sleepy Hollow with the help of the lovely Christina Richie, from the Addams family movies, aka Wednesday now all grown up and blonde.  She's excellent in this movie.<br /><br />It's typically Tim Burton with weird cinematography, gnarled trees, dark sets, but it really does work in this one, since it should have all those things.  It's a good script, a very good cast including Christopher Walkin as the Horseman.  I will easily give this 4 stars for entertainment value alone.  Another good one to curl up with anytime.
0765325950|2.0|Wish Robert Jordan survived to finish this. Thank you Brandon for finishing the series. Just wish it was done more in Robert Jordan's style.<br /><br />Too many Americanisms in the character's dialogue, especially Mat.<br />Too many battle scenes that really just took up space and took time to read but didn't further the story.<br />A whole lot of new characters, with lots of pages dedicated to them.<br />Hasty job of tying up loose threads/plots.<br />Many major characters were given barely a nod in this book.<br />Didn't like the ending (Is that really how RJ planned it?)<br /><br />Recommend that you read a summary, skip the 900+ pages.
B009EEHVA0|5.0|Movie has lots of action works great on my kindle also when using HDMI calbe and watching it on TV and sounds good on surround sounds.
B002G4FQI4|4.0|This disc is great if you don't mind the compressed-to-death mix. Then again, this process is  standard in the modern recording industry. Luckily, I am able to overcome this inconvenience by using my audio software to tweak the sound to a more natural and smooth setting...and it sounds great! My favorite track, \\"Come in From the Cold\\",  has a Memphis soul backbeat and keyboard that is reminiscent of something that Al Green might have recorded. Perhaps he did and I'm not aware of it. This is not my favorite Benson album, but its worth having if you are a Benson fan. Overall,  nice selection and flow with James Taylor and Christopher Cross covers for added pleasure.
B004I744AS|5.0|good and complete definations, gives examples. Can't get any better. I now use it more often than the paper dictionary because of it's quality and ease of use.
B003O86FMW|4.0|More action than hunger<br />games. Look forward to movie, and book three. It is a bit chick flickie, but enjoyable.
B0094BB4TW|2.0|I removed it from my kindle fire . it wouldn't update, only shows a few posts on my news feed, and wouldn't allow me<br /> to comment or like anything..
B000002VMD|5.0|what can i say W .H .I .T .N .E .Y. . . . . . . . . .
B00A6N8F4Y|2.0|This star filled movie failed to entertain.  The basic idea of the story was poor so I should have guessed that no amount of star power could reverse the bad plot.
B003NFM3JU|5.0|I bought the combo pack for my wife for Christmas. Our whole family ended up watching it.<br />It was a very good per chase for the price. I highly recommend it.
0307165485|5.0|This is the perfect gift for a child that enjoys being read to.  All the stories are classic and gather easily the interested minds of young kids.
B0034G4OYK|5.0|I don't want to spoil anybody's experience explaining the movie itself in here. I just want to add that this story have some \\"underline\\" stories that are touching but also explained in a funny way; the father that wants to protect his daughter from the outside world but does not realize that our kids are just are a \\"lend\\" from life to us and someday they will go their own way, that they have to go to the outside world and learn from themselves even our best desires to protect them they will get hurt and learn from the experience and that's life something that all parents would empathize. The issue of acceptance of somebody just because is different it is also explained a human in a place of monsters, the issues with change and adaptation to new circumstances things that some adults will understand and appreciate and our kids will need to learn and assimilate. The animation is magnificent and my 5 years old found some parts hilarious (Frankenstein cannonball at the pool and further \\"disintegration\\").  There are some side jokes for adults that fortunately young kids most likely would not get. There are some characters that are simply hilarious such as Frankenstein, his wife, the couple of skeletons, the mummy, the werewolf, etc.<br />Like all this kind of movies the issues of love, parent's guidance, friendship, having fun and acceptance, change are masterfully displayed in my opinion. The movie is not too long like all kids movies should be.<br />The whole family really enjoyed watching this movie in the theatre and that's why we are ordering the DVD. Contrary to the opinion of others who think this movie is inferior to others (frankenweenie, etc) my son watched frankenweenie and he wanted to leave the theater before the movie ended, he was spooked by the \\"not too beautiful\\" characters and the darkness of Tim Burton, the fact the movie is black and white, etc, etc, etc.<br />I highly recommend this movie the laughter and some applauds of so many kids that were at thetheatre watching the movie certified my opinion.
B003O86FMW|5.0|I chose a five star rating. It was a good book. Having Peeta and Kat back in the arena is nice. Looking forward to the final book.
B005K17RU0|5.0|Really enjoy this app.  Radar, current weather, and an extended forecast, all in one program.  Good visuals, easy to navigate.
B008XG1X18|5.0|Find much information about all that you could have ever imagined, from health to natural products to any and everything!!
B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|This was a 5 minute recap of Seasons 1 & 2.  It was particularly useful to me, since I had not seen an episode at all.  And my viewing was hours before Season 3 - Episode 1.
0446554995|5.0|I love this book and I got it for a good price. Can't wait for the next one to come out. I really love this series
B0086700CM|5.0|this game is the best In the world.I love it and it downloaded fast and is a challenging game. if u like games that are fun you'll like this game
B003TSEEDY|4.0|A perspective worth considering. This is a well written story of compassion and honesty.  A look at how to keep life real without spinning out of control.
B00AFCEIB0|1.0|I do not like this app...it is very complicated and hard to use. I'm going to remove it from my computer!
B0026772N8|5.0|I really loved this book. It was my first time reading something that required a little more thinking. I would recommend it to anyone searching for a challenge.
B009KS4XRO|1.0|I loved this game at first...it was free...then when you get so you really like it you reach a point that you can't play anymore without spending alot of money!!!
B005ZOBNOI|5.0|It was just a good read. I'm just filling space now so that the book can get the review that it deserves.
B00APUQJLO|3.0|A film that leaves you feeling, &#34;WTF?&#34; This avant-garde work oozes with symbolism and metaphors. The first one you should pick up on is the rat. The rat symbolizes a universal currency when society is at its lowest point. Toward the end of the film, Eric's barber comments &#34;You're hair is ratty.&#34; Investor Eric Packer (Robert Patterson) represents all rich people whose world must be destroyed to make way for the new. This is your basic Phoenix or Shiva philosophy. Eric is being driven through NYC as all kind of events are happening outside of his limo. Eric is shielded from these events as his financial world goes to ruin. The world outside passes by almost in a surreal fashion and at times he blocks it out altogether.<br /><br />We have the destruction idea as Eric has bet against the Yuan, Chinese currency. The theory implies that China is the new empire built upon the ashes of our American empire. Don't bet against it.<br /><br />The people who enter Eric's cab appeal to be bits and pieces of his psyche. This is brought out when one woman who prattles on about philosophy (some key metaphor points) and claims she is his &#34;Chief of Theory.&#34; Sarah Gadon plays Eric's trophy wife, a woman he knows nothing about and hasn't slept with. Their whole relationship was odd and clearly symbolic of...God knows what. Eric builds his world on formula and balance when life has neither.<br /><br />For people who like their films straight forward, forget it. Good luck with this one.<br /><br />Parental Guide: F-bomb, sex, full frontal nudity (Patricia McKenzie). Perhaps the longest &#34;finger wave&#34; in film history.
B000RZIGSG|5.0|The movie and cd package was terrific. My wife loved it. My wife had a old cassette that would not play any more and the Flash dance dvd and cd fit the bill
B0097EWK3A|5.0|This game worked great on my kindle fire touchscreen. It was really fun to play and didn't have glitches like I expected it would.
B007BGQFTQ|5.0|I loved it so much I hope you do to I couldn't help but fall in love with these books they are amazing
B002C4YYEU|4.0|Really nicely done and a great touching story.  Don't analyze it too much like the critics did, just enjoy it!
B0084BMUFA|5.0|The essence of the spirit from the past that our stores  in the present try to conjur up in us in this  age of blasphemy to get us to buy more stuff.  The author reflects on a time and unity of people that now exists less and less.
B00817RYCG|5.0|A huge best-seller during the Vietnam War and after, when I was in college, I hadn't realized how radically modern it must have seemed when it was published. Lots of time-shifting; takes some attention.
B009FZHYKU|5.0|I am a subscriber of Netflix and they offer all episodes from the first two seasons for no extra cost than the monthly subscription. I really got hooked on this show and watched all episodes from the first two seasons, and found out the only way I could see the newer episodes from season 3 was to purchase from Amazon. Now I've purchased all of the season 3 episodes and I'm DYING for the next episode to be aired. This is a great show and about one of the most disgusting ones I've ever seen from the amount of blood, gore and be-headings.&#60;LOL&#62; At least I'll know how to fight blood thirsty crazed zombies if they ever start taking over the Earth. The key to killing them is to ALWAYS aim for the head. &#60;LOL&#62;
B002E8B212|5.0|This is a must for blues fans... It's a very relaxed setting for these two and they must have enjoyed playing as much as it is to hear them interact.
B004GHNIRK|5.0|Our society is heading in this direction but as for the book. I love it. I loved the original movie.  I don't care for the new version with the signing even though I like the people who play in the movie.
0765325950|5.0|I have only read about half of the book and am trying to enjoy it slowly because I know that once I am done with this book, there will be nothing else. I don't know about the rest of you, but I will definitely feel an emptiness after finishing the book because there will be nothing to look forward to in the world of WOT.<br /><br />I'm giving this book 5 stars already even before getting to the best parts because I want to counter balance the idiots that gave it a 1 star just because the ebook won't come out until spring. Get over yourselves. True fans of the series will buy Hard Covers, and that's a fact. Stupid Trolls.
B004T0XYM8|5.0|Sergio Lioni, great movie,great screen writer,great director great cast. All in all GRRREAT! What more could a you want out of an old classic western? Oh I almost forgot the music wow!
B009HV2JT8|1.0|What an idiotic premise, which of course is why I had to watch it! DO NOT WASTE YOUR TIME! It is 2 hours of my life I will never get back (movie is not that long but I realized I was still sitting there with my mouth agape long after the movie was over and am not really sure how much time had passed!).
B00A9X9TIW|1.0|Very disappointing, long, violent, stupid movie.  Don't waste your time.  It is confusing, hard to follow, gratuitous violence ridden, and without much plot.  A disappointing offering from Bruce Willis, who is usually fun to watch.
B00070Q7VO|2.0|Not that great.  his voice is something to be desired.  One or two songs ok, the rest mostly stink.  Wish I had passed.
B00A8ECU24|5.0|It's a really good game it's so cute and i love all the ponies some of them look really weird but the others look really cute I love this game :)
B000002I69|5.0|I was in 4th grade when I first heard Time Out on KDKA-AM radio out of Pittsburgh, PA. It was love at first listen. More recently,I had the sublime delight of experiencing the Dave Brubeck Quartet and Ramsey Lewis Trio on the same stage in State College, PA. Two legends in one long, luxurious evening of the best jazz this girl has ever heard. Dave asked his friend, Ramsey Lewis, if he would consider touring with him that year because Dave's cardiologist told him he wasn't up to a solo run. Ramsey said yes and the rest is jazz history. Time Out began with the high notes of what I imagine to be the chorus of the piece drifting around the hall and when the time was just right, the familiar intro appeared and the audience burst into heartful applause.There's something about a live performance, as if the sounds are woven into clothing designed just for you-- the listener--and there you sit, wrapped in it until the last chords of the piano fade and the lights come up.<br /><br />I've said all that to say this. A year or so later and Dave Brubeck is no longer with us. Thank God we still have his music. I am grateful for this collection and think you will be too.
B00AECGQF2|5.0|Toca Hair Salon ROCKS! I saw my cousins playing it on their ipods originally and then I decided to get it! Super fun and we like to do competitions for the best hair style! :) worth the $ too!
B0073XORCY|5.0|Certainly different from the original, but what do you expect?  Why would Tull do the same old thing again?  I love it and I highly recommend it to Tull fans, and anybody else with a bit of sophistication in their taste for rock music.
B003O86FMW|5.0|Somewhat predictable but still manages a few surprises.  The first book was needed to set the story up but this book far exceeds the hunger games.
B006OAB3ME|5.0|I've always been a fan of Paul McCartney - with and without The Beatles - but he outdid himself with this CD.  It has become one of my all-time favorites!<br />Although his voice is almost unrecognizable, it has a very pleasant quality, is easy to listen to, and completely suits the material he's chosen.  And with Diana Krall and other amazingly gifted musicians joining in, it's a perfect collaboration.  I can't imagine anyone not being impressed with this, especially us middle-aged and older folks who are familiar with the mostly old songs he sings.  And his original song, &#34;My Valentine&#34;, is one of the most poignant and haunting tunes I've heard in a long time.<br />This is one of those CD's you'll get hooked on and you'll want to share with all your music-loving friends.  At least, that's what I did.<br />Thanks, Paul...I still love you, yeah, yeah, yeah!!
B007CRTNWK|5.0|I had to pick a book that was at least 180 pages long. After watching the movie with my friend it made me want to read the book even more. There are some words that called for a dictionary, but all-in-all it's a very good book. It shows how difficult cancer is on the whole family not the patient. I side with Ana, her mother should not force her to practically kill herself for her sister. It would hard to suffer the loss of one daughter, let alone both.
B00AB0AR2U|3.0|Like playing the game.  Enjoyed some familiar names from the game.  It is just a mindless shoot out just like video game, enjoyable when you don't think much about the plot.  Nothing is suppose to make sense, just blow them all away.
B005IQZB14|5.0|Inspirational. Reminds me of my years as a forester, which I miss...I'd love to hike portions of the trail but now need ibuprofen to tolerate any hiking!
B008NA3I30|1.0|I just finished watching this movie and Im happy Im not the only one who didnt like this movie. I love Seth Rogan, but I swear I didn't understand what was going on between Seth's character and Margo. Margo was emotionally up and down. And then the end..like what really happened..there was a lot of things left unsaid and I guess I had to be a really intellectual person to understand.<br /><br />BTW: The naked women shower scene was not needed. Yikes! :/
B00000E9O7|5.0|i gave this to my husband for Christmas and he loved loved loved it. its a wonderful piece of work
B008NIS2SS|5.0|If you like jazz, this is a must have.  Bill Evans was one of the greatest jazz pianists of all time.  This has seven albums of his works and is a real treat to listen to.  If you like Miles Davis and John Coltrane, you have to listen to Bill Evans as well.  A classically trained pianist, he brought a disciplined playing to jazz, without ever losing the spontaneity characteristic of jazz.  If you don't love this album, you probably won't like Davis, Coltrane, or Art Tatum either.
B008GXHOFW|5.0|I love this game because I can buy lots and lots of stuff. My favorite thing you can buy is the black Spiderman outfit.This is the best game ever.
B003TSEEDY|4.0|I loved the book but I don't really understand some things.... Oh well I suppose the book wouldn't be as great if there wasn't some mystery to it
B002RI9UBS|5.0|This book is an excellent read and I am so glad that they have made a film of it Should be great
B000EXZI1E|5.0|The Bee Gees are the best band ever created. The harmonies, lyrics and beautifully crafted sounds of these three brothers are amazing. This particular album is one of their best.....great, great music
B001GJ9G90|3.0|A average movie. The suspense stuffs is just OK. I could have like it better without the love and hate stuffs.
B003ZSJ212|5.0|I've really been blown away by the quality of these blu-rays.  I feel like, especially in the case of the older trilogy, which is MUCH improved visually, like I'm almost watching the saga again for the first time.  Couple that with the price break and this is a money buy.
B000W089XS|5.0|A light-hearted comedy about three models trying to find love in NYC. The each prove, in their own way, that it's just as easy to fall in love with a rich man as it is to fall in love with a poor man. This is the perfect chick-flick! Comedy, romance, and fashion rolled into one. I would definitely recommend anyone to watch and enjoy this one.
B00846REIS|5.0|I read this after reading fifty shades due to the similarities and it wax great. A wonderful love story!! I definitely recommend..
B005PK57NU|5.0|Stated watching the Good Wife in Season 3.  Ordered Season 1 and 2 from Amazon to get caught up.  Love the show!
B0050DIWFC|5.0|I HAD to read this book as it was a Book Club pick, and I really didn't want to as I did not know this author.  But I read it and I just could hardly put it down.  I read every day but still did not finish it in time for Book Club Review, so I purposely could not go as I didn't want to know the ending until I had read it for myself - it was hard to read, but in retrospect it, in my opinion, was the only way it could end -
B00AHSIQWE|5.0|Best Batman movie I've seen yet.  Can't wait for the next one. I bet the next one will have Robin in it.
B004SJ3BCI|3.0|only downloaded this because an Amazon rep recommended it because I had not had anything downloaded on my Kindle Fir HD yet.  It's o.k. but I am not a big game player.  I played it a couple times just to try to understand it.  I have to play around with it some more before I can say much more about it.  I just downloaded it 2 days ago so they really have not given me enough time to try it out yet.
B005MLOOJA|5.0|Started watching The Good Wife in Season 3.  Really liked it so I ordered Season 1 and 2 from Amazon.  Love the show!
B0006GAO5Y|4.0|Ordered this because it was on t.v. with commercials and it has been a really long time since I watched these movies. The first 2 Rocky movies are pretty much classic but after that, they are just o.k. They were shipped rather quickly as I always get the super shipper and it comes way faster than you think. Amazon is awesome with that!!
B000006YXV|3.0|Great compilation, but missing one critical song - \\"I Want You.\\" Who wants to hear Marvin without that song? I would have given 5 stars otherwise.
B0000630YA|5.0|\\"Who's got the power?  'We do!' And who gave it to you?  Donny Osmond!\\"  Alice Cooper is King.  I'm one of the lucky ones that saw him in concert between his Killer and Welcome To My Nightmare albums (although I did buy Lace and Whiskey for some strange reason, but I can't remember any of the tunes).  Anyway, I'm an Alice Cooper fan.
B0082GQ5HG|3.0|It's not a bad Kids movie, the kids did sit a watch the movie they just didn't seem to have the wow factor of the movie.
B008Z9YGEE|1.0|Ok, I get it, people don't really care about good film making ultimately. And there is something that people responded to in this film, but I don't know what it could be.<br /><br />I read all the books, and really enjoyed them. The books should translate to a film fairly well. They are practically written as a screenplay. But even saying that, I did not watch this film expecting a match to the book, or even a perfect matching of the characters. I was ready to just see a good film, regardless of how true to the book they were.<br /><br />This is not even worthy of being called a film. It is some kind of cheap presentation. Something you'd see at a tourist attraction in a crappy little theater where someone shook the seats and sprayed mist in the air under the premise you were watching a &#34;Senseorama&#34; demonstration.<br /><br />Horrible screenwriting, horrible acting, horrible casting, non-existant cinematography, editing that feels like the result of some kind of computer algorithm that just mixes up shots randomly to music and dialogue, and seriously low budget visual FX. At least those crappy Transformer films get the FX right.<br /><br />There is no film making craft visible in this picture, it needs to be categorized as something else. It's not even on par with cheap and cheesy TV movie of the week style story telling. This is barely on par with most video game cut scenes.<br /><br />If you have any respect or admiration for cinema craft, do not waste your time sitting through this abomination.
B005LAJ212|5.0|What can I say, Great story line, Kept you guessing, Loved all the twists and turns, I do reccommend this season a must watch, I can't wait for season two.
B009GEEMLY|1.0|This is like taking a box of super hero toys and jamming your head repeatedly into the box with your eyes wide open until you are blind and bleeding.<br /><br />Another film where it's obvious nobody really cared about actual cinema craft. Good story telling, good photography, screw that let's make a bunch of really idiotic action sequences for people who are dressed for no sensible reason at all like 8 year olds on Halloween.<br /><br />At least there are some decent visual effects, that is the only reason I can see this film deserving the one star I am obliged to give it.<br /><br />This film is horrendous. If you think a guy wearing a red white and blue unitard and mask with a big A on it for &#34;America&#34; (plus little wings for ears) reading dramatic lines of dialogue sounds like good cinema, then maybe this is the film for you. Clearly, most of America actually bought it. But to me this is as low as it gets.
1451695195|5.0|Great book regarding out of body experiences. It is very believeable.I recommend it. It made a believer out of me.
B00A6PD8RQ|3.0|The Pixar formula is just a bit too omnipresent here. The jokes, the characters, the story beats, all so familiar and predictable that it's hard not to feel a little disappointed. The first trailers and images of this film really gave me the impression that Pixar was trying to push their story telling boundaries a little harder, but not so. It's an enjoyable film, beautiful designs and color work, great animation as always... but nothing out of the ordinary for Pixar. They took no chances at all I'm afraid. And let's be honest, they can afford to take a few chances.
B007J4T2G8|1.0|This story line is ridiculous.  I found myself laughing at the absurdity of the writing.  I am hoping there are zero number of young women who would ever put themselves in this position.
B007ZXK08C|4.0|Jennifer Byrne mentioned this on the book show.  She said that it was not suitable for panel discussion due to spoiler alerts.  Ditto.  Just do yourself a favour and read it!
B009UZBLSG|5.0|Purchased this to mirror my Nexus 4 display to TVs. There is a micro-usb port for charging (sync unconfirmed) and a regular sized HDMI port for output.<br /><br />Using a normal HDMI cable from monoprice, the mirroring works perfectly. No additional software required. Plug in and go.<br /><br />However using a monoprice redmere cable, I could not get the tele to pick up the signal. The redmere cable would have made this the perfect portable mirror setup. I confirmed the redmere HDMI cable works by try it on an xbox 360 on the same television.
0446580848|5.0|I couldn't wait for the paperback to come out.  I great read.  Can't put it down.  DeMille has done it again.
B009MF56GC|5.0|The Expendables is a very good movie love the one liners very funny looking forward for part 3 all the stars for one movie brilliant idea stallone love both expendables
B005ZOBNOI|5.0|This is a life changing book! You really must read it! It is so well written and make you feel so many emotions. You will love this book.
0765325950|5.0|I started reading WoT back in the 90s when i was just in 6th Grade. I've enjoyed every one of the books more than the previous. I'll admit I was a little Sad and the end of Memory of Light, but that was because it was the last book of the series. The book started with a bang and kept the pace up.
B002UXRGM0|5.0|Photography and narration are outstanding.  The prizing winning show is suitable for most youngsters as well as a nature teaching aid.
145210655X|4.0|Bought a couple copies of these for holiday gifts - perfect for Star Wars fans of all ages, especially for friends who are new dads and/or sons!
1419707671|5.0|We gave these books to our granddaughter for Christmas.  She was so excited!  She just loved them and had one read before they left to go home!
0439882826|5.0|Bought this as a Christmas gift for my cousin's new baby (he's a big fan of Star Wars) and EVERYONE wanted it. As in pretty much EVERY SINGLE MEMBER OF MY FAMILY.  When they saw this awesome book (that has a large pop-up on each two-page spread surrounded by 3-4 mini pop-up elements AND a pop-up Luke Skywalker with a light saber that actually LIGHTS UP!!!), poor &#34;Darth Vader and Son&#34; was relegated to &#34;old and busted,&#34; while this Star Wars book became the &#34;new hotness!&#34;
B00992CF6W|4.0|I have had minecraft since alpha stage just after Redstone. I'll say the pocket version is missing a ton on the main game in the pc, but not Beeing glued to my desk top is very nice, just lay in bed and be a lazy Sunday morning lol.<br />Or even late at night after a long day at work. Turn on that Pandora radio and this app and your good :)
B003JTHXOK|5.0|I loved this book! I couldn't put it down. It reminded me of the movie Enough with Jennifer Lopez. I love movies/books where a woman comes out on top! I gave it 5 stars bc it was able to maintain my attention and interest through the whole book. I wish there was a sequel to it...lol.
B001N4RORE|5.0|It was really just a lot of fun. Who cares about how professional it was.... the cast was amazing! :D
B004E2XAFW|5.0|My son-in-law loved this CD, so I would recommend it to anyone liking this type of music and the group.
1612183956|5.0|Just like the hundreds of other reviewers mention, this is the type of book you simply can't put down once you start.  I lost a few hours of sleep during the work nights last week because I had to see what would happen next, and then after that.  A few extra pages turned into a few more chapters and so on... I may have been a bit more groggy than usual the next morning but no regrets.  If you like adrenalin pumping, mystery novels that take you into a new place all together then this is one you won't want to pass up!<br /><br />And...Mr. Crouch, from one Twin Peaks fan to another, I cannot thank you enough for the charming Peaks references infused throughout your story. I do hope you will consider weaving in more of this in future works.  Thank also for the awesome tribute at the end!
B0068RHGJM|5.0|My son-in-law requested this for Christmas.  He was glad to have it added to his collection and thoroughly enjoys the CD.  Great gift for those liking this type of music.
B00ARAN9JW|2.0|Who keeps funding this Resident Evil stuff. I watched this one first simply because I thought it may be interesting. After watching it, I thought it was awful. It has always looked like an interesting watch and maybe similar to Mutant Chronicles. It's nothing like Mutant Chronicles in plot or quality.
B00936A0ZW|5.0|My son-in-law loves this particular music artist and had it on his Christimas list.  He wasn't disappointed at all with the product and was more than happy to have it added to his collection.
B008Y7BE7E|5.0|It's got Woody...Of course it's going to be great! Put up or shut up! Really liked that they incorporate the rules that you've always wondered about in every other post apocalyptic movie. Such as, buckle up or double tap. C'mon those are no brainers.
B007N5YIUS|5.0|this game is totally addicting I can't put it down!! I totally LOVE IT and recommend highly to all! :)
B007ZGO7EM|5.0|simple  to use and it  looks and feels like a real calculator on my kindle fire. very basic....uncomplicated.  very cool.  exactly what i was looking  for.
B00785P2QC|5.0|the only thing u could do different is have the whole board already unlocked and have more types of trucks
B008JMKN4Y|5.0|I absolutely loved this book and can't wait for more from Jamie McGuire! Abby and Travis are some of my most favorite characters!  Please read my review at:  [...]
B003ZSJ212|5.0|This was a steal!! We know these are great movies but very expensive.  I only purchased them from Amazon because they were affordable so it was a great surprise for my son!
B009RI4FRU|2.0|I wanted to see this in the movie theater, but missed it. I am glad I only paid 3.99 for the rental. This movie was slow and boring. I couldn't even get through it in the 4 hours I was on the plane. It was awful, I don't recommend it.
B0042FZOFU|5.0|What a deal!! I had been shopping everywhere for this product and it was way too expensive.  We are enjoying these movies!!
B006QQQ5SI|4.0|This movie is way better than most movies put out by Hollywood these days. It is a wonderful movie about birding and birder competition and relationships. As a birder, I thoroughly enjoyed the book and the movie is pretty faithful to the jist of the book. The movie is one a person can watch over and over again and again which I have done and will do when the need arises for a good quality movie.
0345477618|5.0|AWESOME book. My son loved it, it was more in depth than we thought. What a deal for the price!!
B000FBJAEG|5.0|I have now read three of David Baldacci's books and each one has been fantastic.  Great writer and definitely keeps you wondering what will happen next.
B009329Y30|3.0|It had some sweet moments and you were rooting for the characters but it didn't blow me away.  I'm not sure how much chemistry the two actors had.
B004TI5N38|5.0|Well written and kept me wanting to read longer to find out what was going to happen next.  GREAT AUTHOR!
B00AMBH70S|3.0|I really wanted to love it since I really like the lead actor but I have to say that it didn't come close to the other Bourne movies.  Not worth the extra $1 you charged in comparison to the $3.99 rental fee on everything else.  Wait till the price lowers to rent it.
0765325950|1.0|Agree with these other reviews. Forcing people to buy hardcovers is ridiculous.  Publish on kindle version as soon as it's released.
B002ZG974M|5.0|This documentary movie about babies raised from various cultural/ethic backgrounds is fantastically shared. It was insightful, funny, and educational. It was worth the purchase! Would highly recommend this to anyone wanting to learn more about child development and the roles of cultural influences.
B00AQ3K8IU|5.0|I don't read books I first started with the amazing 50 shades series even though in my opinion the 3rd book wasn't to impressinv. Anyway hopeless, I finished this book in 4 days I was up till 3:30am because I needed to know what happened. I most certainly enjoyed this book I am upset I read it so fast because I did not want it to end. I don't know what to read now. Amazing book read it read it read it
B004Z7AHTI|4.0|I bought this DVD collection as a Christmas gift for a niece who loves the series on Dairy of a Wimpy Kid. Collection set was a great deal.
B00ARAO720|4.0|My favorite bike is a steel frame beater with no gears, and I loved this movie. It won't win any awards but its a fast and furious nail-biter. You know the feel good ending is coming and yet it still maintains its suspense. If you think you'd enjoy watching steel kick some carbon butt, and some NYPD butt, check it out. If you love bikes, you might love this simple, good natured, joyous film too.
0307595579|4.0|This is a partial review of the trilogy:<br /><br />Stieg Larsson's series has been praised and admired by scores of reviewers before me and I would like to echo that sentiment: this is a really good series. Stieg Larsson's ability to mix horrible images with good and simple things truly is delightful. I don't know how many times Blomkist makes coffee, or Salander turns on her Powerbook, but his ability craft it in with the horrors surrounding the text creates a sense of grounding between the reader and the story. It brings a sense of realism and pleasure within a dreary world. A respite within all of the calamity.<br /><br />Salander is a super hero. She is incredibly brave, has great physical prowess  and an impeccable memory. Every super heroine must have a weakness, and her weakness is her ability to relate to others and her past. At the end of the series her past issues have become resolved, but definitely not her interpersonal problems. If you are a few books in and still unhappy with the progress of her character, I think you will always be unsatisfied with Miss Salander. She is resolute and unyielding. I don't think she is a character that you would encourage your children to emulate. Her fierce independence is definitely not worth the lonely soul.<br /><br />Other reviewers have slammed this series for feminist propaganda. There were many areas that bothered me in the series and I think the author, if he was still alive, would agree with you. The main characters repeatedly engage in multiple partners, S & M, and other things without penalty that butt against a conservative Christian world view.<br />The series never presents a moral compass. Religion is never mentioned as a viable answer. However, I think that the traditional conservative worldview is that as long as we don't do these certain things that we will be fine. Blomkist is a horrible man because he sleeps with multiple women in the text of the book without a display of conscience, yet his undying resolve for justice and truth can be overlooked.<br /><br />If you get a chance to read these books, be inspired by Blomkist and Salander to stand up for truth in the face of opposition. I think that is the best takeaway from this series: truth is worth fighting for, and it is never right to harm your neighbor be they a brother or a sister.resolve for justice and truth can be overlooked.<br /><br />If you get a chance to read these books, be inspired by Blomkist and Salander to stand up for truth in the face of opposition.

B007SYWFRM|5.0|I have a Kindle Fire and did not play games, but after trying a few I am hooked.<br />Love it. I enjoy Ice Age Village very much, better than any I've played.
B0063IH60K|5.0|Live to use this app to while away the hours when far from home. MobilityWare has definitely hit a home run here.
B000OBYLVO|4.0|I didn't feel this movie fit in the category with a Holiday movie as per say with This Christmas, Nothing LIke the Holidays etc. But the movie was good.  I enjoyed the movie.  I love Jack Black but did not like him in this part.  I would recommend this movie for the price I paid
0553213105|5.0|This is the best romance novel. We all want to find our Mr. Darcy. I'd even settle for Mr. Bingley. I love getting into Lizzie's world and reading about her journey to love.
B0018RWD1S|5.0|I was able to purchase this at a great price, not long after Amy's death.  I now have all her CD's.  Amazon took care of me as usual.  Amy will be missed.  A great talent gone to soon
1594200696|4.0|This is a great update on a classic. This really helps with the writing style and the added pictures are a bonus!
B005WUHAX8|5.0|This was a gift for my daughter.  She likes it very much. I do too.  I am going to order one, too
B003XF1XOQ|2.0|It was hard to finish this one. It read more like a video game than a book and was extremely redundant. After two books I was hoping for a good finish but instead the book dragged on. Katniss is such a weird main character that really never found her fire. I was hoping she would be the heroine she was in the first book, but she really never got there.
B000MR9D5E|5.0|I bought this as a gift for a 3 year old boy.  He is fascinated by the images and has watched it almost every day.  His parents enjoy it as well.
B0038BBA4I|5.0|This is a true album where every song makes sense in the progression of the album.  Numerous songs are great and all are good.
B000VBIGD6|5.0|One of my favorite xmas movies. Arrived 3 weeks before scheduled ETA and was a brand new movie in orginal packaging. I plan on keeping this around for years to come!  Great price too!
B00APUQRPC|5.0|This was a true to life, heart warming movie.  The casting was superb as was the acting.  I will never do another review for you,<br />since I am required to write a certain number of words.
B009IA3O2O|5.0|After the disappointment of their last album, this album returns to what I loved about Kamelot. He went back to the vocals like he had in Ghost Opera, Poetry for the Poisoned, and The Black Halo. If you loved those albums, you will love this one.
B00AQ3K8IU|5.0|Finished it in one day!!!  Not at all what I expected!  Heart stopping and emotional.  Hopeless is not how you'll feel after reading
B003VANOFY|4.0|I have had this headset for about 2 years now. The sound is amazing, and the battery life is surprisingly really long.<br /><br />The only issue I have had with it is the micro USB port actually stop working on it. It will eventually pull itself out using logitech's charging cable. I had to RMA mine twice because of this issue. Logitech was very helpful getting a new pair to me without cost both times. Since I've used my Kindle charging cable to charge it and I have had no issues. The only thing I can think of is that the cables latching system is way to tight and will slowly tear out your USB port over time.
B005K17RU0|5.0|This app is a great download, I use it everyday so I will know how to dress my kids and it is always accurate.
B001UV4XIS|5.0|movie works great<br />watched it a few times already<br />no scratches on the dvd and it also doesn't freeze up
B0067R0APK|4.0|Love this, it's come in so handy. One thing I wish it could do better at though is locate specific positions better. I type in an complete address &amp; it approximates where it might be on the screen. In this day &amp; age of GPS, I'm slightly surprised. But maybe they're still upgrading certain technical difficulties. Thank you for the peace of mind it creates with storm situations.
B002PMV9FG|5.0|movie works great<br />watched it a few times already<br />no scratches on the dvd and it also doesn't freeze up
B007SGM084|5.0|I was unable to stop reading Fifty Shades Trilogy. At first i was shoked but once i finished the first book I was hooked and couldnt stop until i finished the last one.
B001UV4XHY|5.0|movie works great<br />watched it a few times already<br />no scratches on the dvd and it also doesn't freeze up
B003JTHXOK|5.0|Loved it!  I shared every emotion in this book including sadness, strength, love, and hope.  I hope the movie is as good as the book.
B004GHNIRK|4.0|I liked it. It was fine. I don't really have much else to say other than it was good. Thanks.
B00280LYIM|5.0|I would recommend this book to any adventurous 10-13 year old. It's definitely a five star book. These books just keep getting better and better. I could picture every seen right in my head. Another Rick Riordan masterpiece
B002MQYOFW|5.0|I loved this book so much. It was deemed with tragedy and love. Let the hunger games begin. The End
B005CRQ4GU|5.0|It was so funny I laughed my pants off. Can't wait to read the next wimpy kid book.  So cool.
B005CRQ4GU|5.0|This book is awesome and a great addition to the diary of a wimpy kid series. It is also great a  an ebook I love  it and I hope u will too.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|A powerful book. Best book I ever read. Its very funny, but shows the emotion from each character. Simply amazing.
B00AHSIQWE|5.0|This entire Batman series was the best directed of all the comic book heros. Every movie touched a sense of my psyche. I can recall fearing for my own life at on point. Absolutely thrilling Great Movie. Great sequel. p.s 2nd was the best
B000NY17J6|5.0|I have always thought that Linda Ronstadt has one of the finest female voices to come down the pike in many a year!  Her range of emotion, power, and thoughtful nuances, have made listening to her music a pure pleasure over the years.  In this CD, we can listen to a great spectrum of Linda's wonderful work from the beginning to more current recordings, and this is already a favorite of ours!  I have to say that, unfortunately, Linda has come under some fire in some less and charitable comments I've seen, because of her change in weight.  For those that do not know, she suffers from a rare disease called &#34;Hashimoto's disease&#34;, and this is the cause of her medical problems and weight changes.  Those who have made snide comments about this have NOT done any homework about Linda, and should really check their facts.  She remains amongst the best of the best female vocalists, and is still just as lovely and sweet as she ever was!!  She is in our prayers, and in our hearts!  We love this CD!
B00ABGEFWC|5.0|This app is great. A good way to pass time and a fun game I'm 18 years old and I love this game....
B00005LOUP|5.0|An enjoyable and imaginative version of this venerable story from Dr. Seuss!  Jim Carrey's &#34;stream of consciousness&#34; delivery is just the thing for keeping you laughing and enjoying this delightful DVD!  Lots of humor in there for us adults, if we're listening, and the kids won't notice even in the least.  A nice addition to our Christmas DVD library!
B005IQ39AY|1.0|I actually love this but it needs a way to turn off vibration. It drives my wife nuts when I play it in bed.
B00APUQRPC|2.0|Honestly, I don't think of myself as a high brow movie goer, (though I have watched a lot lot of movies) but this plot and dialogue were SO predictable and heavy handed it was just uncomfortable. Plus much as I love him Clint is too old for this character who ought to be in his sixties to give proper tension too the plot. That being said, cast is great with lots of great character actors.
B009G8GRX6|5.0|I just started listening to Muse and I have been pleasantly surprised by their work. I am looking forward to buy the two previous albums as well. I think that the instrumental tracks in their albums make them different than other artists out there. If you like one song you won't be disappointed with the rest.
B006GECE9Y|4.0|Can't see much advantage to using one browser over another but works well and I am satisfied. Price is right
0446563048|5.0|I originally got this book from the Library, and couldn't put it down. The author and his team have a refreshing and exciting approach to running their successful business. After returning it to the Library, I decided to add this to my collection, for future reference and enjoyment.<br /><br />You can also &#34;Like&#34; Delivering Happiness on Facebook, and receive regular positive posts to your FB wall!<br /><br />The vendor had the book priced well, and it was delivered promptly and in it's described condition. Great job!
B004DLPXAO|5.0|This is a fun, easy to use product for downloading book to your android. I use it all the time and never have problems. I would recommend it.
B009OCR1X4|5.0|This is a most superior work that is uplifting. Folk who don't know about this soundtrack and the movie itself shouldn't wait to obtain it. It is most outstanding!
B008JGSM6G|4.0|This is a great game to keep your mind active &amp; having fun at the same time! Hope you enjoy it as much as I do.
B009E3EY38|5.0|The greatest band ever lived.<br />Love the music and you get also high quality product.<br />Really recommended for those (like myself) that could not get to the concert.
B008JGSM6G|5.0|This is addicting and great brain exercise! I would highly recommend!!  Really good way to decompress at the end of a long day.
B001ANSS5K|5.0|This  book was suspencful, heart wrenching tale. I can  guarntee you that you will no be able to put this book down.
0345803485|1.0|This guy treats women as sexual tools only.  This book is gross & after 6 chapters I couldn't read any more.
B006LSZECO|4.0|This book kept me interested the whole way through.  I really questioned who abducted Amy far into the story until it became clear who the culprit was.  The ending isn't exactly what I thought it should be, but overall a very good read.
0345803507|1.0|I despise treating women as a sexual tool which is this guys only intention.  Where does love & respect come in?
B002ZG99A4|3.0|The story line was not a intense as Expendables I.  I did like that they made the group a bit more vulnerable than the first (i.e. they can be killed).
1451696191|5.0|This books was simply phenomenal. I watched the movie and i was immediately in love! I bought the entire soundtrack, the book, and i will buy the movie when it comes out in Feb. 2013.<br /><br />Let me tell you this, we all know someone like Charlie. We need to look out, we need to CARE. we rarely do that these days, we're either too busy wasting time scrolling up and down facebook, taking shots at the bars acting wild, and dozing off in class!<br /><br />We can BE more, we can BE Sam and Patrick for the Charlies out there suffering and lingering for the sake of their life!<br /><br />Thank you Mr. Chbosky, I could only hope you write other such novels....i could only hope!
B00992CF6W|5.0|Works great on my kindle fire hd!pretty much flawless except it needs an update with water lava the nethers and some mods.kinda expensive but otherwise really good app.
B0066W1AZK|3.0|after a stalemate, you cant continue playing, and it drives me crazy! I give it three stars. so yeah. that's it
B009VB97EY|3.0|The movie wasn't good and it wasn't bad.  If you are into hot guys dancing with very little real story then you will love this movie.  If you are looking for a hard hitting view of the male stripper world then you probably should look elsewhere.
B005GFPZYK|5.0|This book highlighted the patriotism, professionalism, dedication, and sacrifices of America's fighting forces.<br /><br />God bless our troops, especially our snipers.
B00884GR0W|4.0|This is a good game. But, like the title says, it is always forceclosing on me. Please fix! It ruins the experience, because often when it forcecloses, it doesn't save my progess! Also, when you respawn, it would be helpful if you could be put back in the place the game last saved, instead of some random spot. I had no idea where I was when it happened, and now I can't find &quot;Ted the Viking&quot;:(  Besides the above, this is a good game.
B000W7JWUA|5.0|We replaced family monopoly with family Catan this holiday. Great game! It pretty easy to learn, and depending on how much trading and haggling we did, it took us 1.5 to 2 hours to get through a game (but we are pretty slow players).
B0063GORYU|5.0|its always a new challenge and a great fill in when waiting for someone to move on words with friends.  great free app
B00110K62U|5.0|It is my favorite musical, the cast was wonderful especially Colm Wilkenson, It arrived safely, before it was expected, that made me very happy
B00AKL1XPU|4.0|This game is one of the best games I have played! You don't have to much money.  You can find animals on safari!
B009LA1QW6|5.0|I love Lana Del Rey and this album really did her justice! The only problem I had was when the cd arrived, the case was cracked. That is all.
B00729Z6R4|5.0|I purchased this CD (again) for my sister because I already have it and enjoy it frequently.  It's a refreshing look into a style of music that I enjoy...great vocals, song structure, and guitar work.  Definitely worth the purchase if you enjoy rock n' roll from the 70's and 80's.
B003XF1XOQ|5.0|Great end to an incredible series. Each chapter kept you hanging and made you wonder what's going to happen next. Can't wait to see the movie!
B001NLKT60|5.0|Great read. Can't put it down. Better than the first. On my way to book three.<br /><br />The questions about her childhood answered here.
B000QRIGLC|5.0|Similar story as Restrepo only more tragic,sadly..however just as riveting. From the first page it's hard to put down. A must read!!
B002MQYOFW|5.0|Amazing how great this was - was unable to put the book down, and instantly wanted the other two books as well.  Well developed world and characters, and so much more story than the movie was able to put into a reasonable time - far easier to understand the characters, though the flash of the movie was good.
B00846REIS|5.0|I did't think there was life after 50 shades.  Although this book shared some similar words it was far from the same. Very intriguing. Very erotic. It was a page turner, I couldn't put the book down....  I Didn't want to put it down. Part 2 was just as captivating.  Can't wait for book number 3.
B009SQRL4U|4.0|Sweet story. It held my daughter's (5yrs old) attention the entire movie. It was nice to watch a movie our entire family could enjoy!
B007SGM084|5.0|What else is there to say, if you haven't read it......... SHAME on you!  Awesome read!  Well worth the purchase.
B00AYB0TOW|5.0|Solid blend of genres- blue collar superhero mixed with gritty post-apocalyptic noir. Considering the film is a snapshot of one day in the life of Dredd, there is a good amount of character development over the course of the film.  the film wasn't trying for comedy or romance, the plot focuses on the epic challenges faced by Dredd as he seeks to disperse justice.  the graphic violence and cursing adds to how good this movie is, I'm glad the producers didn't tone it down for a pg-13 rating and a broader commercial appeal.

B007SYWFRM|5.0|Very addicting game, I was hooked right away. :) I have not found many games that I like but this is a good one. There are 4 things to earn; gold coins, silver coins, acorns and hearts. All are used to purchase things in the game. It's a good game to play free but there is the option to buy more coins and acorns if you want to.
0316228532|1.0|Not the typical Rowlings book, Guess I was hoping for a  &#34;Harry Potter&#34;.  Just not a fan of her new genre. Definately not a page turner and not sure if I'm gonna finish it, cuz I need to reread the beginning to remember what's going on.
B0070XFNDE|5.0|This novel, as the other two in the cemetery of forgotten books, is as intriguing, emotional and fabulously written. Carlos Ruiz Zafon will take you again deep into the heart of Barcelona and once you start reading, you won't be able to put the book down. Not many authors can write so captivating as Ruiz Zafon. Must read, in my opinion.
B00AIQP9DE|4.0|I enjoyed the game very much. I found the games relitively fair. objects were not to hard to find. do yourself a tabor though. in the beginning of the game when you get to the managers office go through the book on the desk to achieve getting the key for the cabinet. this little fact makes the rest of the game enjoyable.

1401323820|4.0|I enjoy the Castle TV series so when I found there were books, thought I'd give one a try.  I really wasn't expecting much but was pleasantly surprised.  I found the series to be action packed and found myself unable to put them down.  Fortunately, I am retired and could spend all night reading to find out &#34;who done it.&#34;  I've read the entire Nikki Heat series and eagerly await more. P.S.  Don't be confused by the picture of the author; that's another mystery.

B00005N9CV|5.0|Of course Diana Krall is always wonderful.<br /><br />My reason for purchase is to study it as a singer to learn how to be a better singer or as a choice in how to sing the song in better way. Even if we are different than her singing style, one can understand the great musician ship of Diana Krall.  She is skilled as a Jazz piano player as well as being a singer.<br />Janie Martin
B000N2HBSO|5.0|I learned so much about the civil war and the Times ad they existed then. It is surprising to me that, although I live in the state of Lincoln, Illinois, so much of what is told in this book was a revelation to me. GOODWIN HAS really brought all these historical names to life. I feel that I understand American politics better and wish our present day politicians will read this book and use some of Lincoln's ideas and philosophies in their struggles for a better America today.

B009SJ3GUK|5.0|***Spoilers below***<br /><br />I am simply amazed at how FANTASTIC this show continues to be-- every single episode leaves me craving the next one. It's way better than Season 1, and that's saying a lot. Season 1 was totally addictive and ridiculously entertaining, but with Asylum, they've taken the show to an entirely new level of awesome. The cast is way bigger, the scope way more ambitious, and the stories even more twisted, if that's even possible. How twisted? \\"Spilt Milk,\\" the latest episode, casually deals with necrophilia like it ain't no thing. Totally chilling. That particular episode is filmed in a wonderful and exaggerated film noir style, and the writing is off-the-charts delicious. In my humble opinion, \\"Spilt Milk\\" is beyond brilliant. My favorite moment of that episode involves Lana (Sarah Paulson) leaving Briarcliff. There's a moment outside the building where Dr. Thredson (Zachary Quinto) sees her leaving in a taxi, and she does something so satisfying I actually jumped off the couch and screeched \\"HELL YES!\\" out loud.<br /><br />The best part about the second season is that the stories continue to surprise, even if you think you know what's coming.  Think you have the show figured out? Most likely you don't-- Asylum is that rarest of TV shows that constantly constantly delivers, even for a jaded viewer like me. The plots twist and turn constantly, and the characters are so textured and interesting, you never get bored watching any of them. Every single cast member is outstanding, even the background inmates who never get to say any lines. The main characters are richly developed, and every one of them is rife with backstory, conflict, and drama. The setting, an insane asylum in the 1960's called Briarcliff, defies the very definition of the word \\"creepy.\\" It's a hellacious prison that is disturbing on every conceivable level. Every detail of the place feeds the sinister atmosphere, right down to the icky damp walls in the basement.<br /><br />Briarcliff is run by a Catholic Monsignor, played by Joseph Fiennes. As with Sister Jude (Jessica Lange) and Sister Mary-Eunice (Lily Rabe), the Monsignor is both tortured and a torturer. Asylum subverts religion constantly, yet at the same time, it shows how real faith, not just faith manufactured to suit religion, can save souls. Of course that doesn't mean for one second that those souls will get see their own personal happy endings-- it's a made-for-cable horror-themed show! Odds are, they won't! And it's made by a team with a major pedigree of gory and outrageous content-- for all the reviewers complaining about the level of sex and violence, have any of you ever watched Nip/Tuck?? The show that cemented Asylum creators Ryan Murphy and Brad Falchuk's positions on the map? Nip/Tuck was a boobs and blood smorgasbord, and like Asylum, it was made for cable. Glee, their other big hit, is for primetime TV, which means they have to answer to a different level of censorship. I offer this to give anyone who hasn't seen American Horror Story some context into what you can expect from it(both seasons, but especially season 2)-- Glee, it ain't.<br /><br />Asylum also deals with some of the social issues that were hot-button subjects in the 60s, such as homosexuality, and women's rights. I personally find this kind of writing fearless and impressive, particularly because it's done with a slight-of-hand that makes it feel organic to the story. As with Season 1, the overall tone of Asylum is darkly comedic and irreverent.  Let me be clear-- the show is not a comedy, not by a long shot-- but it blends humor and the absurd effortlessly, while at the same time scaring the pants off anyone silly enough to watch it alone in the dark... or during the day! Yes, some of the absurdity is so over-the-top that at times I've wondered how on earth I'm taking the show seriously. This show throws most of the entire Sci-Fi and Horror genre's playbooks at its characters-- Nazis, aliens, satanicpossession, crazy medical experiments, mutant creatures, evil nuns, and serial killers.  Completely ridiculous plot points when you line them all up on a page like this, but in the show, somehow, they just work.<br /><br />Yes, there is a fair amount of blood and gore. Hell, one of the more notorious characters on the show is named \\"Bloody Face.\\" Some of the scenes are in fact hard to watch, but I don't agree with the reviewers who are decrying Season 2 as torture porn. Personally, I found the scenes of the medical experiments more gross than the Bloody Face ones, but maybe it's just me. Regardless, I'd remind those reviewers that the show is called American Horror Story, not \\"American Drama Story\\" or \\"American Thriller Story.\\"  The operative word is \\"horror!\\" And it's not trying to be some kind of shiny happy commentary on society, even if it does use those elements as part of its texture. Again, it's a cable show, which means it doesn't have to play within the same boundaries as a show for primetime.<br /><br />Asylum includes most of the behind-the-scenes talent that made Season 1 such a hit. Besides the creators/ head writers Ryan Murphy and Brad Falchuk, writer-producers James Wong and Tim Minear are still on the team. if you don't know who they are, their credits include The X-Files, Angel, and Firefly, among others. It's worth noting that James Wong was a regular front-card credit on all the fun monster/creature/supernatural episodes of X-Files, and he is also half of the brains behind the Final Destination horror movie series (again, among tons of other credits).<br /><br />The bottom line? If you like hyper-dramatic, outrageous, storytelling, and if you're comfortable with the horror genre, give Asylum a try. And if you haven't seen Season 1, don't worry-- Seasons 1 and 2 operate independently of each other. In other words, you don't have to watch Season 1 to start Season 2, because it's an entirely different story, with a new cast of characters. Many of the actors from Season 1 are also on Season 2, but they are playing different characters in each. However, Asylum is a serial in the sense that to get the most out of it, watch from the first episode of Season 2 until the last, because each episode builds upon previous Season 2 content.possession, crazy medical experiments, mutant creatures, evil nuns, and serial killers.

B0031YJFCQ|5.0|This was a well-written final book in the trilogy by Larsson. He did a good job of tying in the other two books, without repeating a lot of detail from the other two books.  I like that when I am reading a series.  The characterization was good, the descriptions excellent, the plot gripping.  A really good read.  Too sad for us that he is not with us to write more books.  A sorely missed talent.<br />Would highly recommend this book to anyone that enjoys a good who-done-it.

B009NRO5XE|5.0|The previous reviewer who one-starred this jewel while professing to be an audiophile has made me wonder: would a cinephile pan Woody Allen's \\"Manhattan\\" because it was filmed in black and white?  I hope not.  Moreover, this release is so well recorded that no true audiophile should diss it.<br /><br />OK, well.  I love Bryan Ferry.  He launched his career with Roxy Music and immediately launched a parallel solo career by reworking (mostly) other people's songs, with results ranging from mundane (\\"Taxi\\") to sublime (\\"Song to the Siren,\\" \\"The 'In' Crowd,\\" \\"Like a Hurricane,\\" for example).  \\"The Jazz Age\\" brings Ferry's career full circle, as he has reworked his own songs into 1920s hot jazz stunners.<br /><br />This is the first release in Ferry's 40+ year career on which he does not perform.  No worries, fans: Bryan's hand is firmly on the throttle throughout, and the result is perhaps his most groundbreaking release ever.<br /><br />No, this is not a geriatric tribute to music long since passed.  Rather, \\"The Jazz Age\\" is an unprecedented reinterpretation of 13 Ferry originals as if they had been debuted in America circa 1925.  To console the audiophile who sparked this review: relax, dude.  Ferry made \\"The Jazz Age\\" monaural on purpose.  He recorded it on 1920s-era equipment.  One channel.  That is why it sounds like genuine hot jazz, not like some sterile (though reverent) exhumation of music long since passed.<br /><br />Tell me another artist who could have turned his/her new wave catalog into genuinely hot jazz instrumentals.  Go ahead, I dare ya.<br /><br />I suppose that people who dislike hot jazz will not change their minds because of this album.  No problem, folks: go with God.  But if you can wrap your head around \\"The Jazz Age\\" by pretending that it is a parallel universe radio retransmission of a world in which Bryan Ferry was allowed to flourish forty years ahead of schedule, then click \\"Add to cart\\" and get ready to enjoy the album of this (or a muchearlier) decade.

B00A11AN6O|4.0|After realizing that Amazon will not update the Kindle Fire 1st generation, finding this on the cloud on the device the other day was a great boost. Now I can upload all the photos we want to show off on the Kindle to the cloud. We have uploaded all the photos of our puppy Juniper and now when out we can just show off to our hearts content. It is easy to download specific photos to the device. If we can't get an update these apps are going to be a life saver.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|This is one of the best books I have ever read!! It is amazing!<br />Everyone should read this book. It changes something inside of you.
0812992784|4.0|I recommend this book even though it is in some ways a bit disappointing.  I am a devoted reader of Salman Rushdie's amazing fiction and a passionate supporter of the battle he has fought for the right to free speech.  The reprehensible fatwa declared against him by the Ayatollah Khomeini on Valentine's Day 1989 for the so-called offenses against Muslims committed in \\"The Satanic Verses\\" would keep Rushdie under cover and dependent upon police protection for thirteen years.  This book deserves to be read to understand and honor the sacrifices Rushdie was forced to endure and to recognize those who stood with him.  (More people than Rushdie were affected, not least the Japanese translator of his book, who was murdered; the Italian translator and Norwegian publisher, who were both seriously wounded; and numerous booksellers whose shops were firebombed.)<br /><br />I say the book is a bit disappointing for two reasons.  First, it is not like his fiction.  It sounds obvious and even silly to say but in writing about a real life - even a life that could be described as stranger than fiction - Rushdie does not, perhaps can not, deliver the magical imagery, the enchanting wordplay, the unforgettable characters that we find in his novels.  To be fair, we do get some interesting portraits: the eccentric but devoted members of the police detail guarding him, some of his friends and family.  But these are generally shallow and occur only in the context of events.  The only `character' who is with us from beginning to end is Salman Rushdie.<br /><br />In some ways the book reads like a compilation of diary entries, except they are written in the third person.  (Which I found a little off-putting.  I do not know if Rushdie has explained why he wrote his own memoir in the third person.  It could be because, as a writer of fiction, it is his comfort zone.  It could be that it helped him avoid some of the pain of reliving the experience.  But it also could be that it allowed him tocreate some distance between himself and some of his actions, particularly regarding his relationships with women, which are, to put it mildly, inconsistent.)  No doubt Rushdie keeps a detailed journal which allowed him to be precise with names, dates and locations.  Still, there are numerous long passages describing mundane facts such as where he went, who he saw, what kind of wine they drank, and so on.  Rather than add richness to the story they induce drowsiness.  Worse, he will then inform us that he spent a weekend with the brilliant Mario Vargas Llosa but we don't get a word about what they discussed.<br /><br />Second, if there was a prize for name dropping, this book would get first, second and third place.  We read about his trip to the beach with Australian writer Peter Carey; partying in New York with Toni Morrison, Susan Sontag, Annie Leibovitz and Paul Simon; staying at Bono's \\"place\\" in Killiney; dinner with Jay McInerney (\\"Willie Nelson was there! And Matthew Modine!\\"); dinner with Eric (\\"and Tania\\") Idle, Steve Martin and Garry Shandling (who provides the funniest line in the book); something else with Bono; and so on.<br /><br />That said, however, I keep reminding myself that associating with Salman Rushdie in those days was potentially dangerous; public appearances with Rushdie were actually important statements of support, both for him and his cause.  So in the end I am glad to know who stood with him and who ran the other way.<br /><br />There are also some fascinating sections describing how the authorities go about protecting someone with a fatwa on his head.  We can judge by the results how effective they were.  According to Rushdie there were perpetual inconveniences but very few if any close calls.  Rushdie also brings us behind the scenes to the \\"Secret Policeman's Ball,\\" the annual shindig where both the protectors and the protected mingle; Margaret Thatcher (to drop a name) is one of the guests.<br /><br />If you're going to read one thing by Rushdie, don't start here, start with one of his novels.  (\\"The Satanic Verses\\" is a good choice but also consider \\"Midnight's Children,\\" which is amazing.)  If you're a fan, if you want some insight into the author, if you are interested in the struggle to maintain freedom of speech, \\"Joseph Anton\\" isn't perfect but is worth a read.

B005K17RU0|4.0|Easy to use with good features. Certainly as accurate as any other weather forecast. Covers the basics well.  Stylish design
B008Y2FRFO|3.0|Ok for an occasional silly waste of time. Not much variety but probably suits someone who doesn't want a brain stretching game.
B0076HN3T0|5.0|I wasn't a Foo Fighters fan until I watched this documentary.  I was in High School when Nirvana was big and like many teenagers I thought I had it all figured out.  That wasn't music, it was rubbish and I remained a hardened Zeppelin fan.  But<br />as I got older and started teaching music in high school (including the school's Rock Band class) my students started introducing<br />me to some of the music I had missed out on during the 90s.  One night on Hulu this documentary popped up and so I watched it<br />out of curiosity.  I was hooked.  Sadly the language in here isn't exactly appropriate for a high school class, I would love to show it to my students.  Instead I can only recommend that they see it on their own.  A very eye opening look into working bands in today's music industry and a view into the genius that is Dave Grohl.
B003MC5N28|5.0|My 12 year old son and I read this one and discussed it.  The storyline really got my son thinking and his imagination going.  BOTTOM LINE - Great Youth Lit adults enjoy too.
B008MG1E4A|5.0|Outstanding first hand account.  Unfortunately, Republicans who should read this, will not since they are soooo envious of the fact that it was Obama, and not one of their own, who disposed of Osama.
B005WUHAX8|3.0|I bought this in hopes of being a little smaller than an otter box, it wasn't.  I had to compare them side be side to see the miniscule difference in width.  The life proof case is longer than the otter box defender.  As for features, the screw cap which covers the head phones port would be lost on first use for me.  It is a little screw on piece when removed is no longer attached to the case.  Fat chance of me keeping track of it and without it.  I did not try to charge while the case was on, I knew I didn't want it as soon as I saw the size.  It did look like you needed an adapter to charge it.  The case is also slippery and I know I would drop it more than I already do.  BOTTOM LINE -  Looks like it would provide great protection but the small parts and size made me pass on it.
B005IQZB14|5.0|There are some books you enjoy enough, you want them to keep going. Wild is one these. You root for Cheryl's transformation and live her days on the trail with her.
B009M5CJI0|5.0|With a broad sweep of 20th C history, from pre-Hitler to the Cold War, I'm always amazed at Follett's skill in bringing history to life. He again follows the five families he introduced in his prequel,  The Fall of the Giants; and they are characters that fascinate.  I'm impressed by his historical research, his close association with historians as guides and consultants, and  simply thrilled to expand my knowledge of this era through his excellent work.
B001KQZ7I8|5.0|What can you say about a man who is a legend. His book is deep and profound at a level I hope few people ever have to experience. Don't say you never knew. Read this book!
B005FISBV2|5.0|Can never get enough of this incredibly great show.  I'm so looking forward to Season 8.  Hope it coninues to be great.
B007IXWKUK|3.0|The fantasy continues.  If only this character would share her thoughts with her lover instead of with the reader!  I guess it is the mixed  message that creates the drama for the story.
B003L77GRY|5.0|I still love to watch it over again.  We decided to buy it and since we can never get enough.
B003NFM3JK|5.0|I purchased this for my students to view after we read Dickens's A Christmas Carol.  They loved it! Excellent service and price.
B00915G6YE|5.0|I love this program so much.  My husband and I always look forward to continue watching it.  I can't wait for Season 8.
B008602KQI|5.0|I purchased this to supplement the reading of this series by my students.  The DVD was offered at an excellent price and was quickly received.
B003JTHXOK|5.0|This reviewer completely enjoy this book it was a classic love story.  I could not put the book done until it was finished.  It is a real page turner.  If some one is looking for a good book to curl up and spend the day reading this book is a must!  This reviewer can not wait for the movie it come out and see if it holds up to the book!
1423140605|5.0|I purchased this book for my classroom.  As always, Rick Riordan's books enthrall my students, and we are anxiously awaiting more in the series.  this was offered at an excellent price, and as always, prompt delivery.
B003G4W49C|5.0|An amazing science fiction epic following the story of a genius child unfortunate enough to be born into the hands of a desperate government willing to do anything, to anyone, to achieve their goals. Ender is separated from his family in order to go to a secluded battle school in space where he is to learn how to fight, plan battles, and lead soldiers, all the while being outcast by fellow students, manipulated by teachers, beaten by those who grow to hate him, and run down to complete exhaustion. All this in the hopes that he is \\"the one\\". The one to defeat the looming threat of a hostile alien species known as the Buggers.<br /><br />I have seen that some consider this book bad because it gives high intelligence to children and makes the story seem unbelievable. Keep in mind that this book (a work of science fiction) follows a \\"Genius\\" child and that the government program he becomes a part of only takes the most intelligent children of the world. Simply a handful each year from a population of billions. On top of that I believe adults give much too little credit to children and their capabilities at understanding what is going on in the world around them. Children do not lack intelligence just because of their age or lack of experience, they simply lack adults who can see their intelligence due to prejudice.<br /><br />I loved this book and highly recommend it!
B007FH9GA6|3.0|We've watched the Swedish productions of the entire triology. While Daniel Craig and Roony Mara provide commendable performances, we thought the Swedish productions were better and more accurately captured the original book by Steig Larsson. We thought the difference was the direction by David Fincher. We don't agree with Rotten Tomatoes (4 1/2 stars)
B0098VXBIA|5.0|we rented this for a girls night movie. It was so cute and funny too. Would recommend. Will probably watch it again in the future.
B0084BMUFA|4.0|I was watching a cartoon version of this story on the television and I realised that I wanted to read the original.<br /><br />Dickens (obviously) just uses words how direct and simple that is.
B005CRQ4GU|5.0|THIS IS THE BEST BOOK IN THE WORLD!!!!!!!!!! IT HAS BEEN THE MOST IMPORTANT BOOK IN THE WORLD I LOVE THIS SO MUCH!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
B00A8ECU24|3.0|My daughter said it was just ok, she wasn't too impressed.  I would recommend it too younger children, about age 4 or 5.
B005CRQ2DK|2.0|The book is cool but it sucks too the reason i do not like it is because  it is not right for me
B007SGLZP8|5.0|This was an easy read and an interesting book I will always read Grishams stuff it keeps you reading and looking for more.
B008R96NIY|5.0|Clark's major study of a complex topic has been well received across the political spectrum of  prominent reviews in Britain where it has just been  published.<br />His style of writing is exceptionally lucid and lively for such interwoven and counterpointed history.<br />I am one of many I know who has always been puzzled by questions of how the murder/assassination of an ArchDuke in Sarajevo could result in the clash of empires and wars that resulted in the deaths of millions. Clark's latest work, described by the Spectator as the product of indefatigable research into the intimidatingly vast body of sources, offers a balanced and nuanced explanation of a complex and convoluted story.  In particular, I value and found much that was new to me in the narrative and  analysis of the roles of Serbia, Tsarist Russia and France in perspective with then prevailing  views as to the decline of Hapsburg Austria and the Ottoman Empire as great powers.<br />As Clark regularly affirms, there are aspects of these Balkan, manoeuvres and outcomes that continue to have implications for contemporary European and global policy and the ways in which nations formulate it.<br />No one who sets out to read this important work will come away from it without respect for the thoroughness and depth of the research, the quality of the writing, and the challenges posed as to the ways in which conflicting national, ethnic and religious interests. I believe that time and a broad readership will endorse the high rating I give the work.
B007Z9QWVK|3.0|Disappointed in the lack of depth of the story line.  Bounced back and forth trying to parallel two stories which was a little trite.
B003D0E3FM|2.0|The movie would have been fine had the audio and video kept sync.  Unfortunately the video got ahead of the audio and I kept having to stop and restart.  Also, don't rent an online movie from Amazon until you're ready to watch it.  They cut you off the momemt your 48 hours are up.
B000N2HBSO|5.0|Goodwin is one of my favorite authors...her research, use of comparisons, language skills all make for delightful reading.I recommend her to anyone interested in history.
B004J4WLB4|5.0|wonderful story about a foster child and her opportunities to have a productive life, interwoven in the story are the meanings of flowers that are fun to read and think about when you see these flowers in real life.<br /><br />A page turner for sure. Also romance and motherhood are topics, all very  interesting and a different type of story.
B0058YPL66|5.0|love it got it for my daughter for Christmas  she was so happy to get it  !!! well get season two when it comes out
B002GHIPYI|5.0|Simply amazing.  These headphones are incredible.  Their sound is flawless, they're comfortable as anything, and the cord is LOOONG.  would absolutely recommend these to anyone looking to get into the high-quality headphone/audiophile world, but who doens't want to spend a ton of cash to do so.
B007T7MIR0|5.0|Very helpful product would recommend to others. Very useful for my tablet at work. And useful for paperwork also. Thanks a lot.
B005CRQ4GU|5.0|I loved this book. I loved the ending. I would recommend this book to anyone who likes this series.<br />I rated this five stars because it is really funny.
B005MMYBXI|5.0|Very entertaining and class acting. I would recommend this TV mini-series as well as Spartacus Seasons 1 and 2. Thoroughly enjoyable.
B0032CVAQQ|5.0|This is a great work book.  I liked the step by step instructions. It gives hope to those who have \\"lost\\" that remarriage feeling.  I was surprised at how you could apply this to your children as well. Will be getting a hard copy
B004JZBGWI|5.0|Since you can not put word on the kindle fire, this is the next best thing.<br />I love it because it is free.
B00992CF6W|5.0|The best game in the world if you don't think so than your life is ruined<br /><br />You should really get this game
B008FSCNTK|5.0|A friend recommended this Diana Krall CD and I'm glad I listened. It is my current favorite CD. I play it repeatedly.
B008476HBM|5.0|es un muy buen libro y tienes la oportunidad de  buscar el significado de las palabras inmediatamente , es bueno para empazar a leer en el kindle
0765325950|1.0|Four month delay for the eBook release? Ridiculous, I will not be spending money to read this one.  Hello, illegal download.
B0063IH60K|5.0|Love to play the game and it seems more fun on the Kindle. I can play watching TV during the commercials.
B0050DZ8J0|5.0|The Linkedin app is just like the website. Easy to navigate and easy to read. Very &#34;Kindle user&#34; friendly. '- D
B00AA0TJO8|5.0|I really enjoyed the puzzles and though behind this adventure. it was a great way to pass the time on a quiet day.
B008BO61BE|5.0|What can I say? It's the Anniversary Edition of SFV! It includes bonus songs and a DVD of their live performance at the 1983 US Festival. The DVD alone is worth the price. If you are a fan, don't hesitate to bring this home.
B0074AGVWK|4.0|Really enjoyed this story about an adult family who realised how easy life had been at home after they moved out
B001HN690O|5.0|I really enjoyed this movie and so does my son ... I think it's better than the 1st, which seems to be very rare when you start talking about these movies from Dreamworks and Pixar. Good message, good story - I liked it.
B0042VJ1PI|4.0|I really liked this book.<br /><br />It has a nice flow to it and reads easily. The characters are likeable and you can see where the author got his inspiration from if you have watched Castle.<br /><br />And the plot is great, i usually dont read murder mystery books but i will pick up the entire nikki her series
B008MG1E4A|3.0|I tought this book would add some insight into this historic event, and in fact it did. But, the overall pace and narative was plodding and slow and easy to put down time and again.
B0042X9L6A|5.0|This was in excellent condition and came with a couple different filters that I wasnt expecting. I received it in a very timely matter, thank you so much!
B00AQ3K8IU|3.0|i WOULD ACTUALL ONLY GIVE 2 L/2 STARS IF THERE WAS THAT AVAILABILITY.  PLENTY OF SEX BUT STORY SEEMED A LITTLE LONG AND DRAWN OUT TO ME.
B000FC10WU|4.0|I enjoyed the classic murder mystery. Great read on a rainy day with many twists and many great characters. Very reasonably priced.
B007SGLZP8|4.0|As my title shows, it is real good but I can honestly say I did not leap page to page.  And was not thrilled with the ending.
B0042GNDT8|5.0|The recordings here have been top recommendations for over fifty, now in some cases nearly sixty, years and nothing much is going change now. It is not quite complete but some things missing such as Reiner's \\"Till Eulenspiegel\\" may be found on compilations such as this: [[ASIN:B000239AT2 Fritz Reiner conducts Orchestral Works]]<br /><br />Of course all have been issued before separately but never this cheaply or in such good sound. The quality, even of the only mono recording here, the 1950 \\"Tod und Verkl&auml;rung\\", is extraordinarily satisfying; Reiner had the gift of training his virtuoso orchestra into a razor-sharp ensemble without crushing its sense of adventure and spontaneity, so you get to hear performances which combine the advantages of both studio and live playing.<br /><br />I have already reviewed the thrilling disc of opera excerpts here: [[ASIN:B000007RSZ Scenes From Salome & Elektra]] and have no more to add. Of course, Reiner's are not the only great recordings of this music; I will never jettison Ormandy's \\"Ein Heldenleben\\" or Karajan's and Kempe's famous accounts of the tone poems but nobody need feel deprived if this were their introduction to, or their sole collection of Strauss. There are starrier soloists on some versions but the contributions here are wholly satisfactory and it is first for the splendour of the Chicago Symphony under Reiner, recorded and remastered so vividly with just a  hint of residual hum and hiss remaining, that you would buy this no-frills, no notes, no nothing-but-cardboard-sleeves set of glorious music.
B0051MKMNC|5.0|This movie is simply great. The Blu-Ray disc has a wonderful quality and some interesting special features in the menu.
B00AQMSJI2|4.0|Cute characters with enough variability in activities to not be boring.  Can be frustrating to wait while things finish; exercise patience and all will be good.
B000002KHF|5.0|Van Morrison is a poet. Sometimes a bit of a clumsy one , but always the art is there. I don't have any doubts or regrets about purchasing this music and supporting this artist. &#34;Crazy Love&#34; is worth the price of admission in itself.
B00AKL1XPU|5.0|it's alot of fun animals are adorable!!<br />so life like the animals are!!!<br />I think everyone should try it!!<br />it keeps me sane!!!<br />and puts a smile on my face!
B004SD5GZ4|5.0|Always need a great pdf reader. Nothing like the best.<br />Highly recommended to all who use pdfs for home and work.
B009NPKTN6|4.0|I was lucky enough to see this show on Broadway in NYC and there is no comparison however I still found the movie entertaining.  The 80's music is a great reminder of the bands from that time.  I found it to be comical at times as well.  It was cheesy, singing not the best but it was a fun, feel good movie to watch.
0765325950|5.0|I will try to avoid spoilers so here it goes. To start with, this was a rather amazing and incredibly horrifying ending. It is amazing because of the sheer scope of all that is going on and horrifying because of the slaughter of so many of the characters that I have grown to know and love. I was always a bit annoyed at how many central characters there were throughout the series but realize now how attached I had become when they started dying  off one by one, some in heroic ways and others in very random and senseless ways. I wept when I read of several of their deaths, which is rare, I had not realized how attached I had become until now.<br /><br />After such longwinded chapters throughout the series, it was rather surprising and disappointing that the epilogue was only a mere 15-16 pages. I knew that not all the questions would be answered but I thought a bit more would go into covering what happened to many of the characters after the battle. If they had added an extra 80 to 85 pages of epilogue that would have been nice.<br /><br />I was very surprised when I saw how many 1 star reviews this book got until I scrolled through and realized pretty much all of them were by whiners complaining about the e-book release date. We all know that the people who are making those complaint never had any intention of paying for the e-book they were just intending to download it illegally from a torrent site and are annoyed that they are now going to have to wait a little longer to get their illegal copy. If you want to do a review for the e-book then do it when it comes out don't try to tank the rating for the hardback which is what you are supposed to be reviewing on this page.<br />I did read one reviewer who said he hated pretty much the last half of the series yet for some reason not mentioned kept reading. I do not understand why someone would continue to read a series they claim to have hated.<br /><br />Overall, it was an appropriate ending to a great series though avery sad one.
B008K6HN8I|5.0|Use to access the camera on the kindal fire worked as expected - I can see and access all system programs as needed
B009D0LBRO|1.0|Never worked. Don't waste your money. Even tried to download it three times.(after deleting it). Zero support for that prob.
0316066524|5.0|The book arrived on time. I will write a proper review whenever I finish reading this monster. Three more words.
0792839749|5.0|Glad to have this DVD and at a good price.  Children just love the movie and so do I.  Thanks!
B009MO5ES8|5.0|This movie FLIES by... watched it twice - Ingeniously written, acted and directed - You won't forget these characters - A thrill ride from the first frame. See it!
B00A0R0CG0|5.0|Funny as always.  I'm not sure who liked it more . . . me or my grandkids.  I guess &#34;maturity&#34; has nothing to do with it.
B009VLX8FS|5.0|Exceptional CD, enjoyed every song. I would recommend this cd to anyone who is a Taylor fan and even to those who are not.
B006LSZECO|3.0|I could not put this book down and its been a long time since I've been able to say that. HOWEVER, the ending ruined it all!!  I actually screamed out loud, &#34;ARE YOU SERIOUS?&#34;
B008476HBM|4.0|Good book for females only. I really can't see a male enjoying this book due to the narration of mostly  a female.
B000031XCR|5.0|Brand new unopened CD, played flawlessly - will look to this site for other titles and recommend same to others.........
B00AAX68HG|5.0|A light-hearted exercise in logic.  Easy and cute enough for the kids, who seem to do better at this type of game than I do!
B008SVS3FC|4.0|Some really cool tunes here from John Hiatt, the weirdest of which is the story about the Wood Chipper that certainly gets your attention!  This one was on my 2012 Christmas Collection.
B001B2CPH2|4.0|Many of you have already seen this, but have this and the Japanese version in your collection.  It is fascinating to see both approaches to the same theme.
B000QRIGJY|5.0|I love all Michael Connelly books.<br />I would highly recommend this book to anyone who likes a good crime drama.
B00A0SKFLG|4.0|Ton of action, intrigue and great story. It's different than the 1980s movie But was great. Liked the fight and action.
B008KMHFJY|5.0|I was torn between giving this 4 or 5 stars, I loved the book and couldn't put it down but Abby annoyed me a bit with how she would treat Travis.  After reading it becomes clear why she acts the ways she does so you understand a bit more but there are some times when you just want to shake her!  And in turn some of Travis's behaviour is questionable but thats what sucks you in right?<br /><br />There are lots of things happening all the way through that keeps the reader on the edge of their seat.<br /><br />Definitely worth a read if you are a fan of young love overcoming obstacles, I really enjoyed it.
0765325950|5.0|I first found the Wheel of Time in 1996. I was at a bookstore, looking for something new to read, when I saw these huge novels. I thought to myself, as big as they are this is going to be a really epic story, I should check it out. I did. I burned through the 7 books out at the time in about 7 weeks. I anxiously awaited every book in the series since.<br /><br />I got to meet Robert Jordan twice, at a signing for The Crossroads of Twilight, and for Knife of Dreams. Then he got sick. While I felt bad about thinking it, I was thinking but what if he dies! What about the ending? When he did pass away, I not only felt like I lost a favorite author, I felt like I lost all of the characters he created as well.<br /><br />Then Brandon Sanderson came in. I was nervous about it, but he stepped up to the plate in a big way, and gave up time on his own stories to finish this for us.<br /><br />This book summed up in a word: Amazing. A non stop battle from beginning to end, and everything tied together. While it is different than if Jordan had written it, it was still good. And it felt right.<br /><br />Thank you Robert Jordan for creating this world. Thank you Brandon Sanderson for finishing it.<br /><br />Let the Dragon ride again, on the winds of time
B00AQ3K8IU|5.0|I have never written a review on here , i see some that are really long but all i wanted to say is I loved this book!  Colleen's style of writing is brilliant and keeps you engaged through the entire story.  I could not put this book down.  You got invested in the characters and really felt like you we're living the story with them.<br />It is definitely an emotional rollercoaster but worth the ride.
B001KWTBVQ|5.0|I love, love, love, this movie!....Drew Barrymore is enchanting. The story is delightful!  A totally new take on a classic fairytale.
B00ATDOVNK|4.0|Nice distraction while spending time in a hospital waiting room.  The puzzles were challenging enough to be entertaining without being frustrating.
0321885112|5.0|I absolutely adore The Sketchnote Handbook. I received it as a gift a few weeks ago and have read it twice. It serves as a great introduction to sketchnoting for a couple of reasons.<br /><br />First, the book is gorgeously laid out without worrying about making \\"art\\". It feels sketchnoted, and it helps get the reader in the mindset.<br /><br />Second, Mike Rohde got a number of sketchnoters in the community to contribute a two-page spread each explaining how they sketchnote, why the sketchnote, or what they sketchnote. The other sketchnoters provide perspective and prevent the book from seeming like just one man's opinion (which it wouldn't, even without the extra sketchnoters).<br /><br />Third, it's easy to read and very digestable. I read it in a few hours and created my first sketchnote summarizing my takeaways shortly after. It's hard not to get enthusiastic about it.<br /><br />If you're curious about sketchnoting or want to spice up your meeting/class/presentation notes, definitely give this book a read.
B005WMQ5R8|5.0|There is 1 way to watch this movie,  on a large hdtv with the loudest possible sound system you can find. Words can not describe how f'ing epic this movie is, from the art to the music to the animation and directing, this is like the best f'ing thing out there. BUY  THIS!
B0052TDGQO|3.0|This young man has such an incredible voice for his age. Obviously this CD has been done to attract the young crowd but it is still worth listening to just to hear that voice. Stay true to country Scotty & you'll go a long way.
B004J4WKTW|4.0|A sad, dark story, but told well.  The characters are very interesting and the writer does a good job in making them real in a surreal way.
B005K0HDGE|4.0|I'll admit that I'm a fan of the work of Stephen King generally although there have been a few books that did nothing for me.  This book is a great reminder that King can really hit it with a story that doesn't scare you, but develops good, strong characters that you find yourself caring about.  I'm glad I took the time to try this out, it was a good read and I'm happy to recommend this.
B0054S6N04|5.0|I love , love ,love this book!!!  Linda Howard makes her characters fun and feisty plus the story lines always keep me on the edge of my seat!!! And I love the sequel...
0307272702|4.0|Taubes has said that he wrote 'Good Calories, Bad Calories' for doctors and professionals but he found that, at 800 plus pages, many could not find time to read it. So he condensed the information into  'Why We Get Fat',  a book that could be read on an aeroplane trip.<br /><br />He has succeeded in summarising the information in a clear and readable style.<br /><br />I prefer the longer version because I think it takes that long to really present the case he is making--that the dietary advice we are being given is wrong.<br /><br />If you do not have time to read Good Calories Bad Calories, do read 'Why We Get Fat and What to do About It'.  It might save your life.

B000O8OTNC|5.0|This works great for my KA-Bar. It can sharpen the serated edge and it keeps the perfect angle for the blade edge. It has a course sharpner and a fine sharpener. I don't need the course one because i always keep a good edge on my knife. Great little sharpener for keeping in your pocket. Easy to use.
159514188X|4.0|I think many of the people who gave this book poor ratings misinterpreted Asher's intention.  Granted, who am I to put words into the author's mouth?  But I didn't see Asher drawing Hannah as a sympathetic character who had legitimate reasons to commit suicide.  Rather, I felt he was trying to show that high school isn't the clamshell environment we teenagers sometimes consider it.  I think he was trying to show that Hannah *did* have options, she *did* have people reaching out to her . . . but she continually pushed them away.  In fact, near the end of the book, Hannah seems so determined to rack up more reasons to commit suicide that she makes a few incredibly poor choices (the hot tub scene with Bryce, anyone?).<br /><br />On the other hand, I think Asher also does a fantastic job demonstrating how people can try harder to reach out to the loners, the \\"outcasts,\\" the \\"weirdos\\" at school.  Perhaps Hannah wasn't really in a situation that merited suicide, but there are certainly things the people around her could have done better - or, in some instances, not done at all.  For example, spreading rumors.  Or perhaps reserving judgment on someone's character in spite of such rumors, as Clay does fails to do regarding Hannah's alleged reputation.<br /><br />I think Asher's ultimate message is that both parties are responsible: both the person committing suicide and the people who stood by and let it happen, or who, in some way, shape, or form, precipitated that last desperate act.  We can't always prevent someone from doing what s/he is determined to do, but we can try as hard as we can to understand them and help them.  We are not responsible for the way others live their lives, but we do hold every responsibility for how *we* live and treat the people in our lives.

B002MQYOFW|5.0|The Hunger Games had me sitting on the edge of my seat from the beginning to the end.  I can see how this fiction story line could someday be a reality.  Total government control over the people's everyday lives, to the point of dictating how much food is allotted to families is scary.  This could actually happen to a country weakend by a capital government.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|Much more detail than the movie. A must read and after I read it I had to start strait into the next book.
B003TSEEDY|5.0|This book is so honest about life. It's one of the only books to make me get a bit emotional out of a sentence. It really is a great book.
B004FGMDOQ|5.0|Not really at all what I expected! But still a wonderful book! Couldn't stop reading it, finished in two days!
B005K17RU0|4.0|I have had no problems with this app on my kindle fire. Gives exactly enough information to get me where I need to go.
B000FCK65W|5.0|Loved this book the characters are like an extented family. Betty Smith writes so simply without the  unnecessary violence and language  in so many books now written. will be looking for more of her work.
B007TBZ63Y|4.0|A classic with lots of twists that will keep readers at the edge of there seats all night just like all the other Rick Rorden books
B000066C1N|3.0|I love the movie and all it's songs but this sound track has slight variations from the songs in the motion picture.
B003XF1XOQ|5.0|Excellent reading. Great story line and ending. Just excellent,excellent and excellent. Going to send for my daughter to read. Good book.
B00081ELHY|5.0|Came with a huge poster and really nice sleeves, I can hardly believe I got all of it at this price! A fantastic must have!
B003TSEEDY|5.0|Took my back to my high school years. I loved the innocence of Charlie's character, seeing him learning lessons and &#34;growing up&#34;.
B006MW3V6U|5.0|Best show I have ever seen , ecellent photography, acting, set, costumes... I absolutely am hooked!! I am so happy to be able to start at the begining and watch the whole series!!
B005R32L66|2.0|Skype, especially Video calling on Skype, is GREAT and I use it on my computers (desk-top and laptops) often.  Unfortunately, it doesn't work on my new Kindle Fire that I received as a gift.  A real disappointment for sure. Tried all types of downloads no luck.
B00846REIS|3.0|I enjoyed the book and will read the others. That is one f*ed couple in dire need of help. *
B00AIQP9DE|4.0|Great graphics, and fun puzzles.  May be too easy for some but I thought that it was good for the Kindle Fire.
B0017SWPXY|5.0|I recommend it to anyone who needs a good read. There is little about it that isn't a pleasure...I got the kindle version so note that it is not a paperback nor a hard cover book.
B004XMMSZG|5.0|I am delighted with the revised dockBoss.  The original I received before Christmas did not work as per tiocesars' review, but after contacting Cablejive they sent a new version and it works well.

B003O86FMW|5.0|Wonderful book kept me on my toes with all the twists.  I read all three books in a Weeks time.
B009YU6FJM|3.0|Title says it all. Album is missing Chino's signature emotional vocals, evil guitar rifts, and those heavy drum beats. That said I still bought this album. I'll always look forward to their new stuff.
B008Y2FRFO|5.0|good time taker to use at the airport. seems to move realastic.  tum except the wait. yes yes yes yes
B00867GJYK|5.0|A christmas gift for my neice...it was her request and had needed a new DVD because she had worn her other out...delivery was very prompt and afforded us time to wrap the gift.
B007GEMQ2I|5.0|I had hesitated about buying legos from amazon after ordering a couple sets a few years ago and having them arrive with the boxes bashed and loose legos released from their individual bags sliding around inside the actual Danish lego box.  But when I saw the Lego Town Hall on sale for $180, I couldn't resist, as it was #1 on my son's Christmas list.  I was relieved when it arrived completely intact.  Perhaps complaints about the need for better packaging to protect the precious legos was taken into account after customers complained, as I ordered several lego items from amazon this Christmas season and they all arrived undamaged.  Hopefully, the Jeff Bezos customer service pledge was applied and from now on legos will be shipped with sufficient padding to protect them!  My son spent most of Christmas day putting it together!  It's a FANTASTIC set.
B00280LYHS|4.0|As one of a series, which I might mention I did NOT read in order, this book still held some surprises for me.  The neat thing about Riordan's young people series is that the man's sheer love of writing shouts off of every page.  Such a pleasure to read, and lots of humour of the sort I find delightful. Although he writes of demigods, he paints them with flaws which endear them to the reader.
B007IXWKUK|5.0|I loved it...couldn't put it down!  It was a page turned.  The best book of 2012!<br />Definitely a love story!
B00007GZR5|3.0|Few movies deal with what happens after death, and this is an interesting one, with great visuals. I got quite involved in the beginning, but quite detached after the main character dies and becomes a spirit... Have I been subject to too many intense movies lately? See it and see for yourself...<br />If you are a romantic, the idea  of a man literally going down to hell to save his wife will surely appeal to you.
B007ZGO7EM|5.0|A good basic calculator.  I really like the large numbers. It makes it so much easier to see, and for larger fingers  to hit the correct key. Also like the backspace key. Even though I may not hit the wrong key, I still sometime input the wrong number, and with the backspace key, I don't have to start all over. Thanks for a USEFUL faotd.
0345803485|3.0|It was not enjoyable but I kept reading it out of curiosity.  I have been sooo sheltered.  The girl in the story was turned on all the time, always biting her lip and turning crimson.  It just got a little too much for me.  I don't think I will read the next two.
B009ZZDNT6|5.0|This is a great little faotd.  I'm sure the full version is even better (it lets you set multiple alarms).  The only improvement I can see would be if it included the date, not just the day.  Thanks to the creator of the app.
B0014D6PCO|4.0|Much better story and character developement than the last one in the trilogy (Dark Knight Rises) and really good to watch again before watching the last one
B002RVCD6O|5.0|I just really like this series of movies and this one was well acted, had a good though somewhat intricate plot. There was a lot of suspense, drama and unexpected events. It made for a captivating film.
B0055V6EZE|5.0|Got this as a gift for my father-in-law and he LOVES it!  Stayed up all night listening to it and is truly impressed by the musical abilities of Hugh Laurie, who most know as \\"only\\" an actor. Excellent musical debut
B00A8ECU24|4.0|This review does not reflect what I think... I installed the app, and it is a reward for my girls if they are good. They seem very entertained by the app. This app doesnt crash or cause tantrums, so I have no problem with it. Sweet as sugar, good in small doses. Great for what it is meant to be. Well done.
B00004Y6NX|5.0|Brings back some &#34;old&#34; memories. LOL. Enjoyed them when and still surprised to remember most of the words.Good job of remastering or what ever you call it.
B004SJ3BCI|4.0|Ok, we all know angry birds. This game is now a classic. Good times, hours of fun. Not the most thought provoking, but still a great app, especially for touch screens.
B00AKEMHCA|5.0|I love this game.  the best part is the new towers and upgrades.  the greatest is temple of the monkey God.
B00AIQP9DE|5.0|One of the best games i ever played.  The subject matter was good as well.  Not too spooky but scary enough
B009E3EXMU|5.0|Wow! After seeing these guys perform at concerts since the 70's, it is simply a miracle that they can still deliver perfection at their age; (not to mention all the abuse they put themselves through!) They are truly the best rock musicians with extraordinary talent the planet has ever seen. A must buy.
B001KQZ7I8|5.0|ive never tried reading a book off of my smartphone, but I am now and it is a great book and I have no complaints
B004J4WKTW|4.0|The Night Circus is one of those books that I wish I had written. It is beautifully constructed and beautifully written. It is a richly layered novel telling a story about two magicians pitted against each other, on top of a story of a circus, on top of a young boy searching for his purpose in life. It plays around with notions of time and love and reality in a very clever and lyrical way and was an incredibly enjoyable book to read. My only criticism is that it peters out a bit towards the end. As a movie the ending would possibly have worked better, but as a book, and a book with the sort of structure that it has, I wanted more. This is Morgenstern's first novel and I hope she writes a lot more. If this is how she starts, I'd love to see what she produces with a couple more books under her belt.
B003XF1XOQ|5.0|I had a hard time putting this book down. I liked the ending.  Thought provoking and surprising at times but true to the story.
B005IQZB14|3.0|On one level this is a predictable story - woman whose life is a mess sets out to undertake a pilgrimage to find herself, overcomes many obstacles and emerges a better person. What makes this such an enthralling read, however, is that Strayed is such a complete and utter train wreck. Her personal life is a mess, and her preparation for the trail is, to put it politely, woeful, and yet she survives the experience and emerges at the other end with not so much a zen-like take on the world, but more importantly a genuine respect for herself. She is brutally honest about her own short comings and this book is as much about coming to terms with that and moving on. There are times when you want to slap her and tell her to get her life together, but ultimately you want her to emerge triumphant at the other end. Her writing style - one that goes on to evolve into her Dear Sugar columns and related book - is incredibly accessible making this an easy and enjoyable read.
B003Y5H5EW|5.0|Again, must love vampire stories/movies and I love this series!  Loads of action and great graphics plus the storyline is absolutly interesting.
B004DI7HZ6|4.0|I have been looking forward to reading this novel for a while after seeing people raving about it on Facebook. Had it not been for that raving, however, I would have abandoned this book after chapter one, and chapter two, and chapter three, and basically every chapter up until about chapter five. The beginning chapters of this novel are rubbish. It smacks of a publisher struggling to find a new Twilight, but for adults. It is fluffy and lightweight and there seems to be absolutely no point to the story - she goes to the library, she sees a vampire, she rows, rambles on about Oxford University, eats, sleeps, ogles aforementioned vampire, gets upset because other witches and daemons look at her blah blah blah.<br /><br />Fortunately, around chapter five it seems as if everybody is convinced that the bookshop browser will have committed to buying the novel and Harkness turns her hand to writing the novel she really wants to write. The next 35 chapters (and about 500 pages) are really enjoyable. The novel has depth, plunging into the history of science and evolution and well, just history in general balanced alongside a good old paranormal romance. It is well paced and a really good read. It is one of those novels that you find yourself still trapped in days after you've finished the last page. I'd highly recommend it, but be prepared, you'll have to wade through about 100 pages of crap before you get to the good stuff!
B0014KM8FK|5.0|Awesome set of 3 great Martin Lawrence films. All 3 are classics, Bad Boys 2 is better than the 1st but still good to have.
B0028MBKVG|4.0|I'm not sure how Born to Run ended up on my reading list this year, but I glad it did. This is a fascinating story about an ultra marathon built around a Mexican tribe for whom long distance running is not only a way of life, but also a source of great joy. It involves a journey to not only find the reclusive tribe but also get to the heart of why and how we should and could run; exploring our evolutionary predisposition towards running and how commercialism has got in the way of that. This is a great story, but one that requires a bit of persistence. I found the initial chapters a bit disjointed. The author has a tendency to go off on tangents, and in the early stages of the book this meant that I kept losing track of who he was talking about. The style doesn't really change over the course of the book, but I think he settles into a rhythm that holds it all together much more naturally. It was an interesting read on a subject that I knew little about.
B00AEFVRB2|5.0|Well, after too many surfer boy/not so lovable \\"hunk\\" Matthew McConaughey turns out an amazing performance in Killer Joe.  I thought twice about renting this after seeing all the bad reviews but we are so glad we did.  Killer Joe was suspenseful, creepy, disgusting and dramatic.  The ending is great if you follow the course of the numerous lines delivered by Dotty that make little sense while you are hearing them.  This is the best film we have seen in a very long time.
B004JHYRYU|5.0|Over the years I suspect I've bought close to ten copies of this book, perhaps more. I buy it and then give it away, pressing it into the hands of yet another person I know will love it. While there are many books I loved reading as a kid, I think this was my first adult love; the first book that took my hand, whispered tales of foreign lands and seduced me shamelessly.<br /><br />It has been twenty years since I first read The English Patient, and I love it as much now as I did then and yet it is a very different experience this time around. Back then I read it as someone who was setting out into the world, who had explored the world page by page, not step by step. I read it as someone who had never set foot in the desert, who had never climbed to the top of a towering sand dune:<br /><br />  The desert could not be claimed or owned-it was a piece of cloth carried by winds, never held down by stones and given a hundred shifting names...<br /><br />  The grooves and the corrugated sand resemble the hollow of the roof of a dog's mouth.<br /><br />I read it cocooned in the comforts of Australian suburbia, never having seen a harmattan sunset:<br /><br />  The harmattan blows across the Sahara filled with red dust, dust as fire, as flour, entering and coagulating in the locks of rifles. Mariners called this red wind the \\"sea of darkness.\\" Red sand fogs out of the Sahara were deposited as far north as Cornwall and Devon, producing showers of mud so great this was also mistaken for blood.<br /><br />And I read it never suspecting that one day I would attempt to send my own novels out into the world:<br /><br />  The word should be thinkering. Caravaggio's mind slips into this consideration, another syllable to suggest collecting a thought as one tinkers with a half-completed bicycle. Words are tricky things, a friend of his has told him, they're much more tricky than violins.<br /><br />I feel like I am reading it with new eyes (or perhaps older eyes would be more appropriate) and yet there's a lovely familiarity of being drawn back into the intertwined worlds of the four central characters; following them along familiar pathways, and watching their lives and loves unfold.<br /><br />  A novel is a mirror walking down a road.<br /><br />This is one to add to your personal library, but if you have the chance, buy two, then you'll never have to give away your own.riate) and yet there's a lovely familiarity of being drawn back into the intertwined worlds of the four central characters; following them along familiar pathways, and watching their lives and loves unfold.<br /><br />  A novel is a mirror walking down a road.<br /><br />This is one to add to your personal library, but if you have the chance, buy two, then you'll never have to give away your own.
B001N1DPDE|5.0|I bought this for my husband and its awesome! I would definitely recommend it. I especially like the safety feature so kids can't pull the knife out of the holster.
B0036S4C6G|3.0|A Visit From the Goon Squad is a clever book. It wends its way through the lives of a multitude of characters whose lives all overlap at some point - many tracing back to Bennie, a former musician turned promoter. Each chapter is told from a different person's perspective so it is a novel that takes a while to settle in to - just as you're becoming attached to one character you cut to a different one and the previous is lost to you forever...or until they reappear as a player in another person's life. But on the whole all of the view points are well constructed and build the character and events quickly in your head. This is a book that lends itself to being read in large chunks, perhaps on a flight or on holiday, as I found it hard at times to keep track of who was who. It is refreshing, however, to find an author who is willing to play around with the conventional structure of story telling.
B007ZGO7EM|5.0|I love this app. Easy to use. The keys are big.  Works like a charm.  My son is even learning to use it and he is 3.
B005LAJ22Q|5.0|What can I say ? ? I love this show so much that I bought the first couple of season just so my co-workers (who also love the show and are now hooked!) could see it!
B007XKEY6Q|5.0|I play with friends across the country and across the room. This game is just a whole lot of fun.
B005CA4SJW|5.0|What can I say ? ?  I love this show so much that I bought the first couple of seasons so my co workers (who now also love the show and are hooked!!!) could get into it!
B009E3EXMU|5.0|If you're a Zeppelin lover, this is a must have purchase !  It is nice having both the concert and practice dvd's, along with the cd's.
B009369Z8A|4.0|To be honest , when I first ordered this movie I didn't think I was going to like it - I was wrong.  I really enjoyed this movie
B007YJ8ZRK|1.0|Wow, what a waste of whatever I paid on this piece of trash. Had pretty much no plot in my opinion...nothing to say but BADDDD
B009POCG5Y|3.0|Love Clint Eastwood movies and while this certainly wasn't bad - it wasn't great either . . . . .
B000FC146C|5.0|I read this book so long ago, I wanted to 're-read it. Many things I hadn't remembered, so it was nice.  I fell in love with it all over again.
B005LAIIQC|3.0|Unfortunately this movie just didn't live up to any of the originals.  Was really hoping that it would, but it didn't.

B0051ANPZQ|5.0|As a junior high school teacher, I would like all of my student to read this book. It is touching, authentic, and compassionate. I would hope my students would see how powerful they are in regards to kindness and tolerance!
B0063IH60K|5.0|i really like this game. it has been my favorite for a long time and will continue to be a favorite.
B00ANGSSWS|5.0|This album is amazing!! My favorite song is Done For You. I would recommend this to anyone who loves music!
0316227706|5.0|I highly recommend this book to any dog lover.  I bought a few for Christmas as gifts.  Everyone loved them!  I think it really captures the personalities of &#34;man's best friend&#34;.  There are some amazing pictures in this book.  I can't imagine the work that went into each shot.
B007R41E8O|1.0|I purchased this game days ago and it still has not loaded. it gets to 76.0 and will not load anymore... huge waste of money.
B009YP9L7U|3.0|Book sounded interesting  I thought it was a little too drawn out in detail repeated too many times it was a little boring at times.
075669812X|5.0|My grandson loved this book. Was glad I found it and was able to get it for him. Thanks so much
B006WQLH7G|2.0|I'll give it another week. It won't connect to my google account, so every time I log in I get an error message. I prefer the Lookout mobile security, but it's not offered in the Amazon market. There are a lot of apps not offered in the Amazon market that I prefer on my Android devices. But like I said, I'll give it another week.
B0075PYG1M|5.0|Simply, this album is like that.<br /><br />GOOD, SOULFUL MUSIC.<br /><br />It is hard to get to the rest of the songs because the Lift Off is SO MERSMERIZING!<br /><br />Get that Remix EP, too.<br /><br />Respect to Robert and crew.<br /><br />Chris Dave. MEAN.
0143120255|3.0|The book was not what I expected as I had read a review of a book with same title.  There was some confusion on my part as I expected some writing.  This book is full of illustrations comparing the two cities so it was a good alternative to what I was expecting.
B004J09ONG|4.0|Thought the movie was great but way over priced. Never again. I'm switching back to Netflix. You would get more purchases if the prices were more reasonable.
B0098VYCCE|5.0|This was a fast transaction and download.  Great movie! I will use this service again.  My teens thought this was wonderful.
B00AQ3K8IU|5.0|Easy read, will keep you up into the early hours just to see I the story plot will let up! Believe me it doesn't. This story has so many emotions and heart jerking moments. Thank you for such a great story!
B006ZCWTV0|5.0|I'd heard \\"We Take Care Of Our Own\\" on the radio and liked it.  I didn't really fall in love with \\"Magic\\", but I've enjoyed so much of Bruce's music over the years, that I knew I had to get \\"Wrecking Ball\\".  And MAN, am I delighted with it !<br /><br />So many of the 70's rock legends are just rehashing their old songs over and over in their concerts.  And the ones who do write new songs ... well its pretty evident when you listen that they've lost most of their creative juice.  But Bruce is still producing some excellent work, and this CD is proof of that.<br /><br />My favorite songs are \\"Rocky Ground\\", \\"Land Of Hope And Dreams\\", \\"Death To My Hometown\\", \\"Wrecking Ball\\", and \\"Shackled And Drawn\\" (which has been my favorite song for about the last six months).<br /><br />Rock on, Bruce!  You've definitely still got it!!
B003JTHXOK|5.0|I Love Nicholas Sparks.  He keeps your attention and you never know what's going to happen next.  Very good purchase!
B007J4T2G8|4.0|Some people feel they will not read this book because it is too &#34;detailed&#34;. There is no way to get to know or understand who Christian is without the details. This is a love story. A great love story. I was a little disappointed with the end because I almost didn't buy it (probably because I assumed if I was her I wouldn't handle it that way).
B0063IH60K|4.0|I like to play solitaire anyway so having it on my kindle is convenient, especially when I'm out and am looking for something to occupy my time.
B007IXWL2C|4.0|I really fell in love with the characters in this series. I did feel like the ending came abruptly. It almost seemed like there could have been another book.
B00338QENI|5.0|Can't put it down. Loved how both sides (science&Henrietta) , can weave into a great read. Rebecca Skloot is an author I will add to my list. Thank you
B007IXWKUK|5.0|This was the best book of the trilogy. You learn so much more about Christian and grow to love him.
B004SJ3BCI|5.0|Very good my grandson enjoys it he plays it as much as he is allowed to we will download the rest of the angry bird game soon we have Angry Bird free
B0086700CM|4.0|Fast and fun race game, but never ends.  I prefer completing rounds in games and moving up in levels.  Can see it getting boring quickly.
B003XF1XOQ|5.0|It was the bomb. It was very interesting. It's a page turner. It made me want to read more. Best book ever<br /><br />.
B00280LYIC|5.0|I chose this rating because it was a very interesting, keep you on the edge of your seat book! I love this book because it kept me turning the the pages till midnight! I would recommend this book to anyone who finds books a great way to get away from the real world!!! Definitely going to read the second book!!! =)
B002MQYOFW|5.0|I am so obsessed with this wonderful series, my mom got mad! There wasn't a time or day I'd put the book/s down!!! I LOVE THEM SOOOOOO MUCH!!!
B00785P2QC|5.0|I think this game is great. Really enjoy it. It is a Sim city like game but I enjoy it way more.
B00ABXA1HI|5.0|I wasn't positive that this app w as s going to work the way I expected, but it certainly turned my kindle fire into more than just a toy, but now an extremely  usefully utility. I now have a fully fledged computer with me nearly all the time. Just be aware however in order to use this function on a different wireless network you will have to pay a very small amount of money to upgrade the app; well worth it.
B00AAX68HG|4.0|Fun to play.  Enjoyed it more than Cut The Rope.  Not enough levels.  Finished in about 2 hrs. 4 stars dye to ads and lack of levels.
B005K17RU0|3.0|Runs as expected and provides lots of information.  I'd like to see these apps self-terminate when the user is done with them, perhaps using a timer to check for non-use.  A quality app worth having.
B000JIHP88|5.0|Bought this sight unseen as a gift for my 3 month old baby nephew. He loves it! It was apparently easy for my sis to put together, she sent pictures and it looks and from what I hear it sounds great, too. Has kept the baby quiet and soothed him to sleep on countless nights. Worth it for new parents!
B001H4R4LQ|5.0|My 10yr old son has read the series and this book many times and loves it.  I personally haven't read it  but might - since he loves it so much,

B007J4T2G8|1.0|Just not what I expected.  I guess i did not read the reviews properly - or the reviews might have been misleading.  I don't remember anything about this being an erotic novel. I havent been able to finish this book  and tried really hard.  Waste of money....
B007PVHMCG|5.0|We got this set just in time for the holidays - hot ticket item - very hard to get. Perfect compliment to the game craze
B004SJ3BCI|5.0|Its a a very nice game and the free version is pretty nitfy. You can pay and get the full version.  Its usable from 4 years to 75 years - thats the range in my family that plays this game!
B005WUHAX8|2.0|disappointed.. on day 3 .. it already had a scratch on the screen protector. Contacted lifeproof, and they said this falls under cosmetic damage and they would not cover it. For protecting from everything else... you would think it would be scratch proof...<br />also does not have anti glare.. hard to see
B002EEP3NO|4.0|Expensive but a great lego set.  My son took a week to do this one - and he's really fast.  But he loves it - and its looks great.  Very hard to transport and move around once assembled.....
B0063GORYU|5.0|I'm just going to play for a few minutes.  An hour or so later you realize that you're still playing.  Good fun!
B000OZ0NXA|3.0|The Killing Floor by Lee Child is an interesting book with a good plot. I read this book because of the TV ads for the movie Jack Reacher. Wanted to see if this was a series that would hold my interest, so started with the first book of the series.<br /><br />While I enjoyed the plot, I did not care for the style of writing that takes a paragraph to set a particular scene or action which could be done with one succinct sentence. I use the Kindle app on my Android phone to read books. Using this, I can read a “page” with one glance. With the style of Child, I find that I must dig through several pages before I get to any meaningful sentence.<br /><br />If one wants a book with a great amount of descriptive scene wording, then this book is for you.
B007IXWL2C|5.0|I read this book twice (all 3) trying not to do it again - the first one did not end well, so this leaves you wanting more.  More Mr. GREY Please.

B007D2XSW0|5.0|Good program for photo editing. Great for cropping, adding text,<br />reducing red eye, special effects etc. Would recommend for the average joe.
B003ODIZL6|5.0|I love the new version it's so easy to use the new features. It's so awesome that they have it all upgraded and that they have added new and cool stuff to it.
B0000251VW|4.0|I bought this album a couple of weeks ago, and I really enjoyed it. Even though it doesn't have Nicko McBrain playing drums on it, it still is a good album. I recommend any Iron Maiden fan to buy this album.

B009IJJ5B4|4.0|I this is a good series, but the BBC version of Sherlock is much, much better written. If you like mystery type TV shows - it's not bad.
B007V2UGPE|5.0|This app is great for killing time (and zombies). Graphics are good. I really like this type of game. Simple if you pay attention. Good for all ages.

B002W5UVSM|5.0|Was guided to this story by the program \\"The Will\\" on I'D. Had never heard about Toole or his two novels; but wow this is an incredible read.  Truly enjoyed the humor along with the brilliance.  Too bad the publisher kept rejecting this amazing book before John Kennedy Toole committed suicide.
