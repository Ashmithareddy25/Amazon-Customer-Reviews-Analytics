6305736650|5.0|For those who attention spans are are too short or who think of the Matrix as &quot;Deep&quot; - I recommend &quot;Casablanca&quot; - the perfect movie.  Star-crossed lovers have never been more heartbreakingly portrayed than Bogart and Bergman.  The supporting cast and the script are perfect.  The photography is transferred with museum-quality perfection to this DVD.  The movie as it currently exists is so perfect - it is almost inconceivable to consider that up to the end of shooting they toyed with a different ending.  &quot;Citizen Kane&quot; may have a reputation of being called &quot;The Greatest Movie&quot; more often than &quot;Casablanca&quot;, and it is technically brilliant - but the characters of Casablanca visit my dreams often and vividly, and I never dream of Charles Foster Kane and his screen partners.<br />Bogart is perfectly tough and tender-hearted.  Ingrid Bergman is perfectly beautiful and torn between her noble husband and the man she loved earlier in Paris.<br />This movie is, in short - perfect.  I'll not give another film a higher recommendation unless something higher comes along.  To date the film that is superior to Casablanca does not exist.
B000002UEB|5.0|I listen almost exclusively to classical music now, but Operation:Mindcrime is and will always be to me the most perfect musical album ever made. I have nothing to add to the other reviews of the album, so let me tell you about what the Mindcrime show looked like.<br />I was in Quebec city for the Empire show. There was not that much people and most of them were true Quensryche fans from the very first album. So get this:<br />The band played just a few songs from Empire and then went on with Mindcrime from beginning to end (in that order!). There was two giant screens on the stage (one on the left directed to the right, and one on the right directed to the left, so everybody in the crowd had a perfect view of what was going on). But sometimes there was two different things going on each screens. What was going on on these screens? A film of the Mindcrime story with actors, perfectly synchro with the music and lyrics, with an actress playing Sister Mary and singing with Geoff Tate during Suite Sister Mary. The lips perfectly synchro.<br />The musicians were perfect. The music was not too loud and distorted like other metal bands, so we were able to catch every details in it perfectly. It sounded EXACTLY like on the album. The solos, The guitarists, the singers, everything, with the same emotion and intensity. And not to mention a perfect synergy between the five musicians.<br />The crowd was so thrilled (obviously we were all Mindcrime fans who missed the Mindcrime tour. Actually I didn't. I was there two years before. They were openeing for Metallica, And Justice For All. But I was not a Queensryche fan yet at that time. Nevertheless, Geoff Tate stood anonymously two feet right behind me during the Metallica performance. Nobody recognized him. But he was there for sure!)<br />Anyway the crowd was so thrilled to have a Mindcrime show instead of Empire that we sounded like the Colisée was full instead of just a quarter full in reality.<br />Single most greatest moment of my life ...
B00003CX8J|3.0|The focus on the not so surreal characteristics here are so much better than the far fetched comic book interpritations of them. And nobody could have better suited Wolverine than Hugh Jackman. THe best choice a movie has made for casting in such a long time. Patrick Stewart as the intellectually skilled Dr Xavier was also a wise choice. After watching the gripping start of Magneto's cause of anger (his brush with horrors of Nazi torture camps), the movie does give us a neat set of beginnings. Some disapointments - the superpowerhouse Sabertooth, unfortunately is underused here. Just a throw and punch here, and a quick fight near the end doesn't justify the character you are ready for. Toad and Mystique, who are as neat, have too much fun instead. <br />Ian McKellan steals a few scenes as the self righteous yet genius Magneto, the leader of the bad guys. <br />Halle Berry is not bad as storm, or Famke Jannsen as the budding telekenetic Jean Grey. Nice to see a Mutant superhero have a twist: She is still learning to harness her abilities. <br />Very underused is Cyclops. A smooth performance by James Marsden, the young yet dilligent leader of Xaviers' squad. <br />THe effects and enviromnents are a smash. THe plot to change ordinary humans into mutatnts is neat, and no big deal. Just another mad chararters going to dominate the world thing. Still, it was fun. Oh, the mutants didnt have enough time to duke it out. Way too little time.
B0000931OG|5.0|Since hitting it big in the Britpop sweepstakes with 1994's Parklife, Blur embarked on the strangest trajectory of a front rank band in recent memory.  Instead of mining the lucrative Beatles / Kinks goldmine (and losing all credibility a la Oasis), they followed their private muse to Pavementland (Blur) and then into space (13).  These releases were met with acclaim and derision.  Blur became their U.S. breakthrough on the back of a throwaway single (\\"Song 2\\" - woo hoo!).  In retrospect, these collections are fragmentary, tentative, interesting failures - the work of dabblers.  Think Tank continues with the sonic experimentation, this time incorporating elements of Damon Albarn's  work with Gorillaz and his recent foray to Morocco , but - whether from maturity or will - it holds together like nothing they've done before.  Many of their fans hate it.  One told me she liked the songs, but that it just didn't sound like Blur!  I think this is what Blur have been longing to become for years:  a band not embarrassed by their desire to play in different sandboxes.  Whether mining Bowie-esque atmospherics on \\"Ambulance\\" or jaunty Afropop on \\"Out of Time\\" or jazzy flourishes on \\"Jets\\", Albarn and company sound - after all this time - remarkably at home.

0767020308|4.0|Do I really have to choose between this version of &quot;Jane Austen's Emma&quot; and the Gwyneth Paltrow film that came out the previous year?  They each have their merits, and their detractors, and if I had to isolate the key factors in making the decision I would point to two.  First, you ability to countenance an American actress affecting an English accent, which is a deal buster for many on the theatrical film.  Second, and, I believe, more importantly, it comes down to which one you saw first, because of the old familiarity breeds contempt theorem.<br />I saw the film version first, and for me the most memorable scene was when Emma heartlessly insults Miss Bates at the picnic.  After all, it is not often that the heroine you are rooting for does something as brutal as what Emma does and her reprimand at the hands of Mr. Knightley (&quot;Badly done, Emma&quot;) is the story's most memorable line.  The two scenes are effective in each version and they underscore the essential difference between the two.  In this version Emma (Kate Beckinsale) and Mr. Knightly (Mark Strong) are clearly more old school, both in lookis and demeanor, than Gwyneth Paltrow and Jeremy Northam representing the younger generation in the other (I know there are those who want to make the pick based on the physical attractiveness of the leading character of the opposite gender, but I based that decision on intelligence and they are both saying basically the same lines, so that is also too close to call).<br />Actually, the best distinction is between the actresses playing Harriet Smith, Samantha Morton (who did the title role in &quot;Jane Eyre&quot; that same year) for A&amp;E and Toni Collette (the title character in &quot;Muriel's Wedding&quot;) in the film.  This really crystalizes the question for me, because clearly the film version is &quot;Emma&quot; by way of &quot;Clueless.&quot;  This version has more gravity and I certainly consider Beckinsale's Emma to be the better catch.  However, Paltrow does give more of a sense of the character's joy at matchmaking and imposing her views and plans on everyone else.  Ultimately, these two versions are complementary on several levels, which simply adds to our enjoyment of Jane Austen's characters and stories.  My final verdict: See them both, enjoy them both.h.

B00008OSD3|4.0|The Romulan Senate has been usurped by an ambitious young leader from the planet Remus, a mining planet whose population has long been under the thumb of the Romulans. The new government of the Romulan Empire has invited the Enterprise to visit Romulus to discuss a possible peace negotiation between the Empire and the Federation. When the crew of the Enterprise reaches Romulus they find, to their shock, that the Romulans' new leader, Preator Shinzon (Tom Hardy), is not Romulan or Reman, but appears to be Human. He is, in fact, a clone of Captain Jean-Luc Picard (Patrick Stewart), the product of an abandoned plot to place a Romulan spy in a key Starfleet position. Preator Shinzon is in possession of a cataclysmic weapon of mass destruction and has a new plan to defeat the Federation. Captain Picard and the crew of the Enterprise must discover his true intentions and stop him before he is able to unleash this weapon upon humanity.<br /><br />&#34;Nemesis&#34; is darker in theme and in appearance than previous Star Trek films. The idea of characters struggling with their alter egos pervades the story. Both Captain Picard and Commander Data deal with characters who are in many ways identical to themselves, but have very different personalities and values. Preator Shinzon is genetically identical to Captain Picard, but is violent, arrogant, and sociopathic, supposedly due to an abusive and difficult childhood. Data is faced with an android that calls itself &#34;B4&#34;, an apparent prototype version of himself. B4 differs from Data less in his temperament than in his intelligence. He is a mentally challenged version of Data, and his ignorance and naivete causes him act in ways that Data would not. &#34;Nemesis&#34; is a very good-looking film. The art direction is innovative and excellent, and the battles between spacecraft are stunning. &#34;Nemesis&#34;' writers have made the very wise choice -long overdue in Star Trek movies- of making this film like a high octane episode of the television series instead of writing some overblown implausible save-the-universe plot.<br /><br />&#34;Nemesis&#34; is recommended for its good looks and its restrained story that manages to avoid complete absurdity.he television series instead of writing some overblown implausible save-the-universe plot.  &#34;Nemesis&#34; is recommended for its good looks and its restrained story that manages to avoid complete absurdity.

B000003TAW|5.0|I bought this cd when it originally came out.I was around 12 at the time.I remember thinking how dorky \\"Buddy Holly\\" was but yet I loved the cd and song.At the time Weezer wasnt too popular so I didn't listen to the cd that much.A few years passed and I feel in love with Weezer all over again.They're all just so dorky you can't help but love them.That's not a bad thing though.They're just good happy music.I've driven 8 hours twice just to see them in concert.They put on great live shows.Anyway,Weezer is a great band and I think this is a really good cd.
B00003W8NM|5.0|Probably not, if your taste runs toward romantic comedies...but if you are interested in passion and poetry, being fully alive while you've still got a pulse, this movie is worth checking out.<br />There's a line from the movie \\"The Garden of the Finzi-Continis\\" that has stayed with me forever: \\"In life, in order to understand the world, you must die at least once. So it's better to die young, when there's still time left to recover and live again.\\"<br />That pretty much captures the theme of Fight Club, a film about a man with insomnia who sleepwalks through his empty life and well-furnished condo until he meets a stranger who tries to empty his life of fear and regret and fill it with purpose.<br />Sounds serious. But it's also pretty funny in parts.<br />I didn't see this movie when it first came out, as I thought it  would be an empty-headed violent testosterone-driven film. It is violent, it is testosterone-driven (there's only one female of any import in the film), but it is NOT empty-headed.<br />Check it out!
B000000W6R|4.0|Pisces Iscariot is a collection of b-sides from the band's first two albums, Gish and Siamese Dream. As such, it doesn't have the same flow from beginning to end that Siamese Dream did, but that's ok, since this album is a classic in its own right. First off, to describe the overall sound of the album, it sounds absolutely nothing like the grandiose Mellon Collie and the Infifte Sadness and is far grungier sounding than Siamese Dream. This album's raw power absolutely blundegons the listener's ears, but at the same time, this music is very rewarding, too. I have always found that stripped down, minimal production allows the music's true soul to shine through, and this is no exception. This album definitely has a raw grunge feel (much more so than Siamese Dream), and it illustrates that the Pumpkins were first and foremost an alternative rock band. The first song on the album, \\"Soothe,\\" is a hauntingly beautiful acoustic ballad (which was actually a demo recorded in Corgan's bedroom). \\"Frail and Bedazzled\\" and \\"Whir\\" were both Siamese Dream outtakes, the former showcasing that album's hard rock side, while the later is reminiscent of its slower songs. In fact, on both of these songs, Corgan's lyrics are far more open and confessional than on anything else he had done up to that point. \\"Pissant\\" is a fast and furious RAWKer which was also recorded during the Siamese sessions. \\"Hello Kitty Kat\\" is driven by LOUD heavily distorted guitars, and demonstrates that the Pumpkins owed musical debts to the groups such as the Stooges and Husker Du. The heavy guitar echo nearly drowns out Corgan's voice most of the time, but it adds texture to this deeply tortured song (check out the lyrics to see what I mean). \\"Obscured\\" is an acoustic song with some nice insrumentation in the background; it is very much in the same vein as \\"Whir.\\" Both \\"Hello Kitty Kat\\" and \\"Obscured\\" were originally issued on the \\"Today\\" single, but I think \\"Obscured\\" actually dates back to the Gish era; it defintely reminds me of some of the slower Gish songs. The cover of \\"Landslide\\" is nice, but the ten minute epic \\"Starla\\" absolutely rocks. I happen to like the second half of this song better, when the guitars really kick in, and the song just goes off on a swirling, distorted guitar jam for the next five minutes or so. It is absolutely intoxicating to listen to. \\"Blue\\" is a Gish outtake, and it shows in the sound. The last three songs are just ok, not great, so I won't spend too much time on them (but I just have to say that the instrumentation of \\"Spaced\\" is too derivative of Pink Floyd's Dark Side of the Moon for comfort). Considering that this a b-side collection, however, Pisces Iscariot contains a lot of very high quality music, and makes a wonderful companion piece to Siamese Dream. Even though none of these songs were hits, it doesn't make a difference because the album is so raw, so vital, and so alive that it can't help but grow on you. If you are a fan of Siamese Dream, or if you just want to know what true alternative rock is, then Pisces Iscariot just may be the album for you.
068484267X|4.0|Angela's Ashes focused on Frank McCourt's poverty-stricken childhood.  Any money the family was able to obtain was drank away by his father, leaving the rest of his family (including the mother Angela, brother Malachy, brother Michael, and other siblings passed away) to starve and fend for themselves.  He tells of growing up in this life, and his efforts to raise this family for the better, even though he, too, messes up.<BR>In reading this I think to get the full message and comprehension, along with some swearing, one should be fourteen or older.  Also, it could give kids nightmares with its bleak, dark tone.  It's discomforting to know of the sufferings in the world and how horrible they can get.  Its sometimes lightened by events happening that doesn't focus so much on poverty (when he finds Teresea, and goes to the hospital for another time.)  He had a very dry sense of humor, and that could have done with the way he was raised and he surroundings in his growing up.  He uses run-on sentences a lot.  This can get irritating and distracting to the initial thought, but it also is a way of putting so many emotions in one sentence. (When he looses his virginity he writes in a way that anyone could understand his swamp of thoughts).  As the story goes on, his sentence-structure improves and shows him growing up (pretty creative).<BR>While reading, the first half seemed very repetitive, and almost in a whining manner.  The second half seemed better, with more of a plot line.  The book was extremely emotional at times.  It made me think of how it must have been having one or two slices of bread and water a day, wearing rags and old shoes with tire rubber soles, and made me sick to even acknowledge this actually happens in real life.   It made me realize that even though my life may not be perfect, I have it a lot better than some.  I think it was a good book people should read, but be prepared to unsweeten that sugar coated view of the world around you.
B00008GKEG|4.0|I borrowed this DVD from my brother to see if I felt I would watch it more then once before buying it.  If you're a knowledgeable Beatles fan you know most of the story's they tell already.  They've said most of this in interviews over the years or others have written about it.  The only difference is you're hearing the same old stories directly out of the Beatles' mouths.  There's not much that they reveal that wasn't already known.<BR>Having said that I always find the Beatles' story inspiring.  Four lower middle class lads with basically high school educations band together and take over the world.  It's a timeless story which always reinforces the theory that if you follow your dreams, work hard enough and maybe with a little luck you can accomplish anything.  The rags to riches storyline happens over and over again in rock and roll history, but for some reason the Beatles' story always stands alone.  They weren't the first to live the story, but they are the yardstick which all others are measured against.  Maybe it was the innocence of the times, maybe it was the positive message of their music or maybe it was just four lads having a laugh and letting the whole world join in on the fun.  Is there a song on the radio today as much fun as 'She Loves You'?  Everytime I hear it, 40 years on(!!!!), I still get caught up in the exuberance of the boys' performances.  They sound like they're having a ball and it comes across, still.  Timeless.<BR>So the question is...do you buy it?  I'd suggest renting it or borrowing it unless you've 'just gotta have it'.  The quality of the DVD is excellent.  There is a minor EQing problem where whenver they go to any performance footage the sound gets really loud, but the sound quality overall is great.  The bonus DVD is basically Paul, George and Ringo sitting around chatting in the mid-nineties, them goofing around jamming on acoustic guitars on oldies and them with George Martin in Abbey Road commenting on old songs. While it'snice to see them together and getting along I don't think it's worth buying the whole package just for this.  Overall this is worth watching once, not really worth watching endlessly.
B00005JLWN|3.0|As many previous reviewers have noted, this movie is a combination of a \\"Farhenheit 451\\" or \\"1984\\"- type dystopian future movie with a \\"Matrix\\"-like action component.  Actually, the action is more like a combination of \\"The Matrix\\" \\"The Terminator\\" and \\"Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon\\" (without the flying, though).  In a short \\"making of\\" featurette included with the DVD, the director speaks of his desire to wed the two genres, but the movie doesn't entirely work on either level.  The non-action portion of the movie is actually fairly uninteresting and unoriginal, and nothing really surprises you as the main character makes his transition from fascist enforcer to \\"sense offender\\" outlaw.  There are no really especially surprising or original elements anywhere in the movie, really.  Even the opening narration/stock war film montage seems ripped off directly from \\"The Road Warrior.\\"<br />As an action movie, it suffers from the first major action sequence not occurring until a full hour into the movie.  And when the big action finale arrives, there is no real drama, because Christian Bale's character is just an unstoppable super-hero killing machine, like The Terminator (or Nicolas Cage in \\"Windtalkers\\" for that matter) who'll get out of any situation unscathed, no matter how many baddies surround him, or how many bullets are fired at him.<br />As science fiction, it doesn't rate as highly as the original \\"Matrix\\" or \\"Minority Report.\\"  Still, it's not a bad, lightweight grade B, comic book action type movie, but not a classic, even in that genre.
B00005QW4K|1.0|This has got to be one of the worst movies ever made. I am a fan of the first two Evil Deads, I own both Evil Dead 1 and 2, but Army of Darkness was just a complete disappointment. But I wasn't surprised I didn't like it: look at other trilogies that are ruined by the 3rd movie, e.g. Max Mad: Beyond Thunderdome.<br />Army of Darkness is not funny at all. Maybe to a six-year-old kid or something. Maybe Bruce Campbell had some good one-liners in Evil Dead 2, but he's not really a comedy-type person. This movie is just a poorly done caricature. The acting is terrible. At least the other Evil Deads had some decent acting; and the actors are all ugly, especially the girl he falls in love with. Bruce can get better than that-especially in a movie. What? They didn't have enough money for better actors or something?<br />Roger Ebert gave this movie one star, which I think is generous. Roger Ebert is not always right, but this time he is. I suggest you read his review too, because I agree with most of it. If you haven't seen Army of Darkness, at most I'd suggest you just rent it. Otherwise... you shouldn't waste any money on it.
078322804X|3.0|I love The Blues Brothers.  This is one of the all-time great comedies; a truly epic comedy.  In it's original form, it is flawless from beginning to end.  Five Stars easily.<br />Unfortunately, this \\"Special Edition\\" dvd includes 15+ minutes of scenes.  Not under a \\"deleted scenes\\" section, which would have been appropriate and very welcome, but inserted into the movie itself.  To be fair, the extra footage doesn't really hurt the music scenes.  But did we really need to see Elwood at his place of employment?  Did we really need to see where the Blues-mobile is stored when not being driven?  None of the extra footage adds anything to the movie.  In fact, it really ruins the perfect pacing of the regular cut.  <br />I truly hope Universal sees the error of their ways and reissues this film on DVD with the original cut.  They could even make the added footage viewable within the movie, through seamless branching, but for the love of Pete, give us the option!!!
B000068PQ0|5.0|lively, spirited songs that alternately evoke mystery, sadness and absolute joy. Like Grandaddy and Polyphonic Spree, this band seems possessed by the conviction to give all of themselves to the music and in turn rock us so hard.<br />A thoroughly fulfilling album in so many ways.
B000009ED0|5.0|I am sincerely dissapointed that people do not take the time to enjoy the songs from Kid Rock. I am more interested in his style of rap, because it is not all about the downside of everything. Kid Rocks whole deal is a type of party. The reason he raps about 40's and women is because he has millions of them! That is what he does. I enjoy the appearance of the at that time, not too well known Eminem, and Joe C's part in the tile track, Devil without a cause is hilarious. 3 foot ten with a 10 foot D***. It may lack the polished effects of MTV music, but it is a welcome change from all the commercial stuff out there that has nothing to do with the people's lives themselves.<br />I love this album, and Kid Shows that he is not a one sided artist. He can do it all. From Scream hard rock, to Soft lullaby singing, to even old school rap performance. You have to be open minded to enjoy this album, but it has a little something for everyone.
0375758992|5.0|Please read this book! It's one of the most compelling and inspiring stories about life and death that I've encountered. I didn't want the book to end.

0385335482|1.0|I don't understand all the people who rave about this book. It is absolutely one of the worst books ever written. I would have given it no stars at all if I could.<br />The main character is a completely self-absorbed, shallow, individual who is obsessed with how she looks and the brand names of her clothing. She epitomizes everything wrong with capitalism today.<br />The passages where she has to buy that new thing, whatever it is, and doesn't have her card with her and so has to rearrange her entire day and put her job in jeopardy just to get it, is disturbing, not funny.<br />The whole time I was reading this book I kept saying to myself, &quot;Now, I know that was supposed to be funny, but instead, I find it to be disgusting, disturbing and I think the main character needs a shrink not another pair of Prada shoes!&quot;.<br />If you are looking for a &quot;fun&quot; read, as most seem to think this book is, I recommend you look elsewhere.
B000089RVX|5.0|I read other reviews here, since I only heard the &quot;Wake Me Up Inside&quot; single on the radio- and that was enough to pique my interest...<br />Comparisons to Tori Amos or Portishead are SOOOOO VERY WRONG- Apples &amp; Oranges definitely!  Evanescence lead female vocalist- sounds NOTHING like these comparative female artists!  More in vein of Pat Benatar if anything- recent singles &quot;Everybody Lay Down&quot; (1993 &quot;Gravity's Rainbow&quot;) or &quot;Strawberry Wine&quot; (1997 Inamorata) or even the earlier &quot;Promises In The Dark&quot; type of drama and rock.<br />Or even Chumbawumba (1999) group.  And similar to music style of Creed (which is also on Wind Up label).  And I would venture to compare correctly with Pink's latest on Charlie Angel's 2 soundtrack and her &quot;Misunderstoodz&quot; harder edged tracks &quot;Family Portrait&quot; and &quot;Don't Let Me Get Me&quot;   and even Chrissie Hynde's recent (2003 Loose Screw)- more hard edged rock.<br />NOt this 'singing-on-heroin- and-prozac' sound of Portishead or even Paula Cole or Cowboy Junkies...<br />But I do appreciate being introduced to Denali- and I found  that there are no really  well grooving, hard edged musicianship nor passion in the female vocal except morose.<br />This new Evanescence CD is unique in synergy of hard edged guitars, hip hop rap and mellifluous vocals- ala Debbie Harry in &quot;Rapture&quot; and their 2000 Blondie CD &quot;No Exit&quot; and with the same single- having hard edged guitars with rap by Coolio.  <br />And even better comparison in sounding like and just as good, emotional and unique Skunk Anise (Mission Impossible soundtrack and 2001 &quot;Post Orgasmic&quot;)<br />So that is my two SENSE;-)
B000002KKD|5.0|It was 1979 and the B-52s were on Saturday Night Live.  I was in AWE.  Yes they did &quot;Rock Lobster&quot; and &quot;Dance This Mess Around&quot;.  When they were doing the latter, my parents walked in from a night out and my mother said &quot;what is THIS???&quot;  Of course, the very next day I got the album.  &quot;Planet Claire&quot;, &quot;There's a Moon In The Sky (Called the Moon)&quot; are all great.<br />The B-52s have better songs on later albums (&quot;Housework&quot;, &quot;Wig&quot;, &quot;Song for a Future Generation&quot;, &quot;Mesopotamia&quot;), but this overall defined an era in my life that I still love.
B000002C2E|3.0|Bob Dylan's Time Out Of Mind is certainly a mixed affair. I enjoy the bluesy tone very much. And there are several compelling numbers particualrly the eerie Sick Of Love, the pleasant shuffle Dirt Road, and the touching Make You Feel My Love. The instrumental support is certainly first rate.<br />However, whereas the bluesy tone is a good change of pace for Dylan, there definitely is little variation from it. The pacing is slow to mid tempo on most of the tunes. Furthermore, nine of the eleven of them excede the five minute mark including the tiresome Highlands which clocks in at over an ung-dly sixteen minutes. To think that song drags along at the same pace without an instrumental break and then fades out at the long awaited end is just mind boggling.<br />I have nothing against long songs. However, there must be some significant musical ideas presented in order to captivate my attention. Time Out Of Mind is decent in that area but certainly not outstsanding let alone Grammy Award Winning.<br />Truthfully I would prefer Love and Theft to this collection, as Dylan includes more styles in this more recent collection. Furthermore, the songs do not overstay their welcome.
B000003S0K|5.0|It was a long time ago,<BR>When my older sister showed up with this album, she was still just a kid but she knew music (I'm still amazed to this day the albums she brought home in the early 70's it's a staggering list of classics) anyway my point is I couldn't have been maybe 11 but here she was jamming away to Eno's \\"Here come the warm jets\\" in many ways I grew up with this album and to this day certain moments of this album still have the power to hold me perfectly paralyzed in amazement and joy. The creativity displayed here will never be repeated, it can't be, it was a byproduct of a long since gone era. If you consider yourself a fan of early 70's music this CD cannot be excluded from any list of importance. I defy you to find me a record from 1973 that can be played to a new listener that gets the same reactions this CD gets; people are stunned by the quirky creativity and brilliance simply tossed around from track to track like it was nothing special. Usually when a musician comes across something especially unique he makes damn sure everybody notices but on this album song after song is just loaded with genius and oddity and each track just seems to top the next. A very special moment in time is represented here (A+)

B0000033P0|5.0|Actually,<BR>I feel bad because shortly after listening to this CD for pleasure I put on a YES CD and proceeded to write a review I'd been putting off for a day or so. Bad timing for the YES CD, Tarkus is an impossible CD to follow. The performances put forth on this recording must go down in history in some way, the writing and playing is dumbfounding. What makes it so amazing however is not that 3 guys can jam like crazy but that they can explode and then drop in the melodic breaks and the angular displacement of sheer force with sheer beauty, it's truly masterful. This album delivers the promise that progressive rock makes claim to, the promise to be creative and musically adept and to always be just a few steps ahead of the listener by driving us like cattle to what in all appearances is a cliff only to be spared in the end with a delicate melody (for the briefest moment) it's corny I know but man does it work. Only classical music strives so boldly to control its listeners and manipulate them so...(A+) This album delivers the product as promised.
B000062TU1|5.0|Dan was great in this movie i wantched it voer and over again...but i am a bigger fan of the books becuz that way you can imagine wutz happening..but the movie Rox my worLd!
0345333853|5.0|What makes this book so different from most fntasy novels is that the author not only creates a realistic magical world,but she does so while having amazing character development. You feel, and relate, to every character in this book. I literally could not put this book down. Although this book is rather long, I finished it in less then a week. After reading this book, I quickly bought every other book this author wrote. although all are great, this book sticks out as her best. This is a definite must read for the fantasy lover.
B000002VTE|5.0|I love this album more and more everyday I've had it for a while but it never fails me. MR. Spaceman's my hero
0792837614|5.0|Though Natalie Wood doesn't sing her role, her portrayal of Maria is wonderful, along with a dynamite cast of characters.  In my opinion, the cast of this movie is the ultimate cast...the standard for which all future performers in this musical should reach to attain.  The choreography is stunning, as is the use of color in the costuming.  I am impressed with the musical performances on all accounts and the music itself...well, it doesn't get much better than Bernstein and Sondheim.<br />I'm excited for the special edition DVD of this performance, but this VHS is a great value.
B00005KARK|5.0|Dumbo is a very rare Disney animated movie that didn't have a villian, and plus this movie runs about 63 minutes. O.K. I know I reviewed this movie back in December, and I caught this during Disney Channel's get animated that are runs 8 Disney animated movies every night for a week. Well Dumbo doesn't talk, but the other elephants to. To find out what Dumbo is about (see my Decembr 19th review). Animated movies takes 2 to 3 years to make, and yet this animated movie was made in 1 year. The animators was working overtime. If a lot of animators work on animated movies, why does it take a couple of years to make. If only one animator was working on an animated movie, it would take a long time. Where is Dumbo 2? Disney has made a lot of sequels to thier clasic movies and yes, this movie might scare young kids, as much as Disney animated movies do. But that's Disney. The only Disney movies that I feel derseves a G rating are Finding Nemo and Piglet's Big Movie, those are the only titles I can think of at this time.
0688163173|5.0|This book is equally as entertaining as Mystic River.  It has a great ending and is as much a page turner as Mystic River.  Great book!
B00008CLOA|5.0|The 30th Anniversary Edition of &quot;Dark Side of the Moon&quot; is the smoothest, cleanest version I've heard yet on CD.  Like so many fans, I first bought this on vinyl, and eagerly purchased the first CD release when it came out in 1986 or '87. Since then I've purchased a second CD (Japanese master) and now the new SACD/hybrid version.  All I can say is: it's the best version yet!  Lots of depth and detail, without the shrillness or harshness (particularly on the female vocals) that plagued earlier versions. I haven't heard the SACD treatment yet, but the &quot;regular&quot; version alone makes this edition worth buying!
6305428425|4.0|Romy &amp; Michelle's High School Reunion. A light .... ahem ... airy comedy about two social misfits going through their high school years and then making a grand appearance at their high school reunion. You know things never go exactly right until the end in these movies, and the same thing happens here. But hey! It's quiet the entertaining watch.<br /> Lisa Kudrow and Mira Sorvino, awesome pairing. They made Romy &amp; Michelle. This film could have seriously gone off the annoying bend, but it doesn't. It stays on a good track the entire time. A very hilarious track. Kudrow and Sorvino were awesome as the titular characters. They're interaction was great, and Kudrow's present air-headedness role is always a hoot. Janeane Gurafolo is a nice unpleasant character with many humorous lines that she gracefully pulled off. The woman never ceases to entertain. Alan Cummings plays an Alan Cummings role. I always like him in movies. <br /> The DVD isn't something to cheer about. Although the film is great enough, I wish a few more extras could have been spared. But taking note that the movie didn't necessarily come out when DVD hit its prime, it's okay for the lack of extras. What really would be great is an audio commentary from Lisa Kudrow and Mira Sorvino. I say &quot;Special Edition!&quot;
B00004XQ83|1.0|I adore Blue Grass.  This is NOT a Blue Grass offering.  With the exception of maybe three songs this was, to my ear, one weird selection after another.  I would advise the shopper to sample ALL selections. (Chain gang laments????) I give this a capital L for lemon.
B0000029GA|3.0|the lyrics are amazing but the beats are just plain wack. you can't ride around in your car to this album. It's far from being the best album in hip hop but its in the top 3 or 4 best debut in rap history...
B0000844MP|5.0|This review is of the Superbit version of the DVD.<br />I loved the film and believe it's one of the most underrated films of the 1990s.  What an amazing cast.  But this has been covered by others.<br />The addition of DTS audio and better video transfer were well worth the cost to upgrade my older copy of this title for the Superbit.  You will have to sacrifice the extras.  For me, I'd rather have the best audio/video.  Some would rather have the extras.  For those people, I'd recommend the SE edition of the DVD.
B00008DDSC|3.0|\\"Secretary\\" won an award at the Sundance Film Festival for being the \\"most original\\" or \\"most innovative\\" movie of 2002. And it probably deserves that accolade. But is it good?  Will you, the viewer, enjoy it?  That will depend largely on your tastes and sensibilities; this is not a movie for everyone, and a lot of people will find it too sick or twisted for their tastes. But if a fair amount of s/m sex between two consenting adults won't bother you, then \\"Secretary\\" has a lot to recommend it.  Its portrayal of the two main characters is perceptive and non-judgmental, and both Spader and Gyllenhaal do a bang-up job in difficult roles. If you're fairly open-minded, it's worth a rental.
B00003CX8Y|5.0|Disney's great. Supplying the fans with such detailed releases of the most beloved Disney movies. Beauty & the Beast is high on almost every Disney lover's list, and I'm certain that this dvd will satisfy them. Satisfied me. <br /> Three versions of the film are available. The original theatrical version, the special edition, and the unfinished version. The new musical number included in the special edition is a fun one, and to see simple artwork throughout the unfinished version is a fun watch. The tons of supplemental material is too much to actually review. But it shows that Disney cares. <br /> The film was the first animated picture to be nominated for Best Picture, and rightfully so. The combination of romance, humor, adventure, and even a bit of fright make the film one to reach almost every person's heart. Forever memorable characters were introduced in the film, and the morale of the story is great. <br /> Uberinstant Disney fun all-time favorite major classic! In my once again 7 year old mind, that's how I would describe Beauty and the Beast. Wait no, actually, that's how I describe it now. Eleven years later and this movie has not changed (Except for the new musical number), and neither has the magic it has given changed.
0385507755|4.0|This book is not easy to read.  Not in content, not in style.  James Frey's story is a realistic account of addiction and recovery rather than the standard issue movie version.  It is gritty, difficult, at time nauseating in it's descriptiveness of the depravities committed by and to addicts.  I do find the style to be distracting from the story.  His insistence on capitalizing certain nouns, eg.  &quot;I walked down the Hall to my Room&quot; rather captured my attention far more than the plot.  The single word &quot;chain of consciousness&quot; type writing is a distraction as well, I found myself skipping most of those parts in order to get to the real meat of the story.  Overall, it is a good read, not an easy read and certainly not a comfortable read, but well worth investing time in.
B00005B5L4|4.0|Obvious classic, sound is really good (not great) but really good.
B00003CXXJ|5.0|this is a classic fairy tale but with a twist. the prince that saves the princess is actually an ogre. and the princess herself is not really a princess, but an ogress. it's a wonderful story, and the characters are charming, especially shrek and his sidekick, donkey. the graphics are surprisingly good, also. a good film for kids, big and small.
B00005JLWN|4.0|&quot;Equilibrium&quot; borrows heavily from the ideas and styles of other &quot;dark future&quot; science fiction movies, including Brazil, 1984 and The Matrix and its symbolism is often heavy-handed.  Nonetheless, I found it engrossing, and some of the elaborately choreographed fight scenes are right up there with the best of recent offerings.  Overall, the movie is at least as good as &quot;Minority Report.&quot;
0374115370|5.0|Tom Wolfe has a magical touch for breathing life into non-fiction, as in The Right Stuff, but in Bonfire of the Vanities, his skill as a novelist and a satirist is blatantly evident. This bleak and witty portrayal of New York life in the eighties is both hilarious and dark at the same time. Wolfe's characters represent the spectrum of human behavior, while his situations are riddled with ironies and paradoxes of truth about human existence. This book is most enjoyable, I would imagine, if you have at least some knowlege of New York, because much of its humor and depth stems from New York culture, but it is also true that New york is a micrchosm of american existence on a whole, so Bonfire of the Vanities may, in fact, be a universally American Novel. Whichever, it is worth reading if not only for the reason that it is funny, brilliantly written, and makes clear the fact that Tom Wolf's name belongs on the list of satirists that includes Jonathon Swift and Oscar Wilde.
B0000028VT|4.0|You can like this CD only if you're in the mood of Mariah and her sad-love ballads. <br />I am so in the mood for Without You/Never Forget You and All i've ever wanted. That this CD seems to read my mind!!! as well as 'HERO' <br />Mariah is a legend and she proves it on this.
B00008977N|5.0|This is definitely my favorit live concert ever.I have both Cd and Vhs for almost ten years.This DvD is on my most wanted list of DvDs from the time when a buy my first DvD player four years ago.So it was a long wait.But now it is over.I just get this DvD and i am totaly blown away.I wont be talking about the performances of Peter Gabriel or the band because it is EXCELENT and i think the names of  band members talks for itself.So i will be strictly technical.<BR>The video quality could be better for an anamorphic widescreen and there are some places where can be seen some compresion artifact.The grain is ok and i think they wanted to be like this.And i like it this way anyway.It is a film not TV broadcast.<BR>But what realy hit me,from first second to end was the sound.When i found out this disc will be released in Dts i was realy curious about the improvement in sound quality,but nothing prevent me from what i hear when i push the Play button on my remote.If i name you every improvement in sound quality it will be a wery long list.The dynamic is tremendous you can hear every tiny sound of cymbals, the bass drum is a killer (San Jacinto) the guitar flashes to surrounds (Digging in the Dirt) vocals in all songs stands up and they brings tears to my eyes (Blood of Eden,Dont Give Up) etc.Now i understand why they all have a head mics.Yeah they are all singing.You have feeling that you are there,and that is for me the best thing in sound.This is for me a true refference DvD for sound quality along with Nine inch Nails DvD.<BR>So if you like this concert or never seen it before,it make no difference this is true master piece from all aspects.There can be some things done better,but lot things worse,and maybe they will release this concert on some better medium in few years,but believe me i will be enjoying this DvD till that time.
B000077VR3|4.0|The storyline of this &quot;Moulin Rouge&quot; borrows heavily from &quot;La Traviata,&quot; which in turn was based on &quot;La Dame aux Camelias&quot; -- a tragic love story about a tuberculosis-stricken courtesan who ... well, if you haven't seen the movie, I won't spoil it for you. And in any case, the storyline is there just to hang eye-popping, extravagant musical numbers on.  None of it is very believable, but it's fun in a trippy, overblown way. The 1960s-80s music works surprisingly well with the stylized 1900-era setting (&quot;Paris as imagined by Tim Burton,&quot; in one reviewer's words) and the performances are entertaining. Ewan MacGregor is a bit too low-key -- I would have loved to see Jim Carrey in the role of Christian -- but otherwise the cast carries out their assignments quite well.  I'll give this a low 4 stars.
B000067CPX|5.0|These guys have come a long way. They have really fine-tuned their funky sound, and learned to chill out at the same time. Flea and John Frusciante are absolutely amazing artists. Fantastic CD to listen to any time, and I can't think of any song on this CD that I don't like. They just keep getting better and better.
068484267X|5.0|Angela's Ashes is by far one of the more interesting and enjoyable autobiographies that I have ever read.  It tells the heartbreaking story of young Frank McCourt growing up in poverty-stricken Limerick, Ireland.  The book follows the McCourt family through the trials of poverty, birth, death, alcoholism, and everything in between. Only four of eight children survive the tough life that they were forced into in Ireland.  Frank if often made to watch his younger siblings while his father is getting drunk is a pub, and his mother is bed ridden with severe depression.  He becomes more of a father figure and role model for his young brothers.  Frank works odd jobs trying to save up enough money to get himself and his family to America one day.  This book is truly very touching and it keeps you on your toes through out the entire novel.  You are always wondering what will happen to Frank and his family next.  I found myself wanting to laugh and cry through out the entire book.  One page I found myself feeling sorry for Frank because of his situation, and the next questioning his morals and values. This story is a perfect example of the human will to endure and will surely be a classic in years to come.  It opens readers' eyes to new experiences and challenges that many Americans are not faced with daily.  It will stand the test of time well.  I strongly recommend this book for any age group, as anyone can identify well with characters in this book.
6304712936|5.0|This is one of those films that has everything, humor, drama, suspense, and of course, music. Tons of music. I think the acting in the movie would have made it enjoyable, even without as much music as it had. Of course, being that Mozart and his nemesis Salieri are the main characters, music could never be omitted.<br />In the film, F. Murray Abraham portrays Salieri, court conductor and playwrite. A young prodigy, Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart comes along and steals his thunder with some of the most beautiful, and unusual music written to date.<br />Salieri decides to torpedo Mozart and pretends to befriend him, all the while stabbing him in the back at every turn. The interraction between the two actors is fabulous.<br />This is one of those films that I could watch repeatedly. If you decide to buy it, get the director's cut 2-Disc set. It wasn't available when I bought the movie. This standard version is pretty basic, with not much other than the movie on it. Because I'm a fan of extra features, I'll probably buy it as well.
B00005JM03|5.0|I just saw the sneak preview last night and loved it. I had heard I should expect a cross between Ocean's Eleven and The Score, and that was pretty close. It has a feel like The Score or Ronin, especially toward the beginning, but it turns out to be much more light-hearted, and sometimes downright silly, but in a good way. Great date movie if you want to show your girl how slick, chic and adventurous you are, especially when you leave the theater and drive really fast! The chase scenes were quite thrilling, I thought. I never buy movie soundtracks, but I'm actually looking forward to seeing this one on sale. Lots of sleek, orchestral drum-and-bass, perfect for pulling off a heist, with a couple of nice old rock tunes thrown in for good measure. As far as the stars, everyone was great. Ed Norton makes a pretty bad bad guy and is just revolting with that terrible mustache. I was impressed with Mark Wahlberg's portrayal of Charlie Croker, and of course Donald Sutherland was great and Charlize Theron was, well, what can I say? She's a gem. Seth Green's \\"Napster\\" character was a hoot. I definitely recommend this movie to, well, just about anyone. Awesome land- and cityscapes, too. Really nice cinematography. A near-perfect film.
B00008AY3L|2.0|In a word: tired. This is my first Ben Harper cd and I have found it to be uninspired and without much originality. Upon my initial listen, the first three songs hold real promise. They simply don't hold up to repeated listens. Ben's music is all over the place which may not be a bad thing, but it reeks of so many other artists that have come before that I just don't buy it. I don't doubt a bit that Ben is very talented. However, this album sounds very weak when it's held up against the many artists he aspires to sound like here.
B00008H2LB|1.0|Ah, Linkin Park. After their long and respected career that has so far consisted of an album and their remix album, Linkin Park returns to us with Meteora, a majestic opus that lasts a breathtaking 36 minutes, leaving the listener in awe at how this incredible group could have packed so much music on just one cd. <br />The album starts out strongly with Foreword, which consists of some random noises that only add to the staggering length of <BR>this album. Foreword smoothly transforms into the first \\"real song,\\" Don't Stay. After the incredible talents of \\"Phoenix\\" and the guy who always wears earmuffs in his videos, Chester mourns soulfully. A few seconds  later... uh oh, what happened here? Chester is ANGRY. Open about his teen angst, Chester screams about his broken relationship with his mother, presumably about how she forgot his birthday party. <br />The next track, Somewhere I Belong, turns up the angst full volume. It starts with some sound effects courtesy of the DJ and <br />some beautiful piano a la \\"In The End.\\" There's the standard nu metal riffage for a few seconds, and the rapper comes in, with <BR>Chester wailing ocasionally, like a girl, about how confused he is. <br />Somewhere I Belong is a track that illustrates one of the things I love most about Linkin Park: BEAUTIFUL PIANO. The beautiful piano piece found here is incredible, the work of someone who has played countless years. However, I can't help but wonder : who is this pianist, this genius, this modern-day Chopin? My money is on Chester. It seems fit that Chester, who aside from being a vocalist extraordinaire, is also a gifted musician. <br />While the rest of the album is equally a tour de force, the last two tracks deserve special mention. On track 12, the mystery <BR>pianist we met on Somewhere I Belong is back to blow minds as he resumes his position on this two minute epic, easily one of <BR>the most complex instrumentals of all time. Thankfully, he sticks around for the last track, Numb. Numb ends Meteora in all <BR>Linkin Park's splendor. Chester doing his best Justin Timberlake imitation. The expert pianist at his finest, playing a piano piece with such depth and complexity that it only rivals a one-handed Mary Had A Little Lamb. The drummer pounding his drum kit so fast it has to be heard to be believed. The guitarist showing us that he is truly the Jimi Hendrix of our generation. <br />Beautiful.
B00005UW7V|4.0|This is the usual Kubrick film. Many people just wouldn't get it. I saw it because the trailers looked good, and I love sci-fi. The special effects in this film were awesome. I really liked the woman who is talking facing the camera, then turns away, revealing that she doesn't have a head, only a face mounted on a mechanical stalk. Pretty neat.<br />Anyway, the film involves a family whose son is in cryogenic freeze because he has an illness with no known cure. They get the 'mecha' (Haley Joel Osment) as a 'replacement' for him. He gets himself into all sorts of trouble, as he is only a day or two old and is learning his boundaries. The mecha possess a program that will make them 'love' the person who reads a certain set of instructions to them. The mother ultimately reads these to him.<br />Things get a bit crazy when the doctors tell the family that they've found a cure for the disease their biological son has. The son comes home from the hospital, and begins to wreak havok on the mecha. <br />Eventually, he is dumped off on the side of the road, much like a pet that has grown to big for the house. The boy begins thinking that if he finds 'the blue lady', the entity who turned Pinocchio into a 'real boy', that he will be able to come home and stay with the family. He begins his search, and meets many people, both good and bad, along the way.<br />The film had some great (and I don't use that word lightly) acting by both Haley Joel Osment, and by Jude Law. Both of them are fantastic actors. This type of film stretches the talents of actors, as they find that in many scenes they are talking to someone who really isn't there, because the person will eventually be added to the scene via computer animation. Robin Williams even makes an appearance as Dr. Know, a computerized magic 8 ball. That scene is one of my favorites of the film.<br />If you want a movie that has more messages than a fortune cookie factory, rent this. Many of the messages will be lost if you only watch the film. If you missed the messages, try watching it again....
B00005JLWN|5.0|I watched this for the first time today 5-20-03.  This is an excellent movie.  If you are a fan of good scifi then this film is for you.<br />I intend to buy this film and add it to my DVD collection.
B000002UB3|5.0|After the ill feelings that flooded the aborted `Get Back/Let It Be' sessions, the Beatles knew they had to go out on a winner, before it became impossible to work together as a unit. Giving total control over to George Martin who had been AWOL for most of the previous two albums, the boys went on to create a defining rock n' roll jewel and the highlight of 1969 releases (The Rolling Stones' `Let It Bleed' comes a close second). Not only did Martin create the legendary second side medley, but also George Harrison contributed two classics anyone would have killed to write. Abbey Road shines from the immortal album cover to the dying strains of `Her Majesty'. For any Rock connoisseur, this is a `buy or die' album.<br />Come Together - Funky blues from the bespectacled one. Originally, a campaign song for Timothy Leary's aborted presidential bid; Lennon just rewrote most of the lyrics to fit. Paul McCartney's bass can qualify as a lead instrument this time round. Later covered by Aerosmith (among others). Wordplay worthy of Lewis Carroll in evidence here.<br />Something - One of the greatest ballads of all time. You can hear the longing and love in George Harrison's vocals and his stunning lead break. The first time he got the A-side of a single. His response? \\"Big Deal!\\" Sorry George, but it was. Covered by thousands including Elvis and Sinatra.<br />Maxwell's Silver Hammer - Jaunty tale of a psychopathic medical student, sung by Paul. Apparently, McCartney drove the others mad trying to get the `perfect take' of this track; as a result, George and John hated it with a passion! That's Ringo on the anvil,incidentally. Great synthesiser use in the mix.<br />Oh Darling - Slow rocker with `sandpaper throat' vocals from Paul. He screamed himself horse in the recording booth to get the right voice.John repotedly wanted to do the track himself . . .he loved the `rockers'.<br />Octopus' Garden - Shows that Ringo Starr could write classics just like the other three. First worked on During the Let It Be sessions. I love the `underwater' backing vocals mixed behind George's lead guitar solo. I wish this could've have been the basis of another animated Beatles' film; alas, it was not to be.<br />I Want You (She's So Heavy) - Simple joining of two Lennon songs; turning it into an ultimate `cry of love' to Yoko Ono. Feels as if you're entering a musical maelstrom at the end of the track, then it abruptly cuts, as if there's no more room to continue jamming.<br />Here Comes The Sun- Another late classic from the pen of George Harrison. This lovely paean to the sun& nature was written in George's garden away from the constant pressure of being a Beatle. Great acoustic guitar from `the quiet one', with superb harmonies from John& Paul. <br />Because - Speaking of harmonies . . .the most angelic Beatles song ever.It sounds even better accapella (see Anthology 3 to get my drift). The voices truly sound `way up there' helped by some `tasty' synthesiser. All thanks to Beethoven's `Moonlight Sonata'!<br />You Never Give Me Your Money - The beginning of the most famous rock medley of all time! A comment from McCartney on `Apple's' financial trouble and his love of freedom. This medley part is almost three songs in itself!  <br />Sun King - Gentle tune from John with dainty fretwork and harmonised gibberish from Lennon at the track's climax, crashing into . . .<br />Mean Mr. Mustard - A song written in India and demoed during the White Album sessions; the tale of a `dirty old man' could've come straight out of Lennon's books `In His Own Write' and `A Spaniard In The Works'. Great lumbering bass work by Paul, is stopped in its tracks by the acoustic guitar slashing intro to . . .<br />Polythene Pam - Another round of word playing wit from John Lennon,about `a bird in a bag', who is quite a stunner. Another track written in India. You can actually hear the Liverpuddlian accent drenching you as John tells you all. Great buried harmonies in the mix. Whichleads us into . . .<br />She Came In Through The Bathroom Window - Paul's turn to indulge in a little wordplay, partially based on the ingenious ways that female fans used to get near their favourite Beatles. Worked on during the Let It Be Sessions, and later turned into a hit by Joe Cocker.<br />Golden Slumbers - Powerful ballad by McCartney inspired by an old English poem of the same title. Piano is the lead instrument on this track. Paul's voice goes from soft to roaring in a heartbeat.<br />Carry That Weight - Another tale of despair directly lifted from the mess that was Apple Corps. It's clear that by now the whole thing was becoming a heavy burden for our four mop tops. There's even a reprise of `You Never Give Me Your Money' to drive the point home.<br />The End - Another medley slice of three parts. From a roaring McCartney intro, to a guitar duel between Paul, George, and John; finishing with a beautiful piece of piano led philosophy. And thus ends Abbey Road . . .well, not quite yet. .<br />Her Majesty - A medley chunk that was removed at the behest of Paul, and then mysteriously reinserted by an engineer at the end of the album. Paul dug it, and thus it stayed. It's a cheeky ode to the reigning Monarch of the British Isles and it also pokes gentle fun at drunken patriotism. Sounds like Paul was the only Beatle on this track.
0792833201|5.0|I recommend this movie highly! I was very young when this thriller was released, and I still remember sitting in the backseat of my parent's car at a drive-in... my older sisters sitting on either side of me (tormenting me even further than the movie was doing alone)... though I was terrified, I LOVED IT! Especially the part where the guy goes in the bathroom, looks in the mirror, and starts ripping his face off... CLASSIC!! Just make sure you turn your TVs off at night when you go to sleep and you will be just fine!!
B00003CXTG|3.0|With the glut of WWII movies that have popped up since \\"Saving Private Ryan\\" and \\"The Thin Red Line,\\" there were bound to be some cheesy ones. Pearl Harbor, unfortunately, fits this bill. They took a story that needed no embellishment and embellished the heck out of it, to the point where you get a 3-hour movie with a story line that winds like a mountain road and has a terribly predictable ending.<br />If, instead of inserting a goofy love story, they had focused on the battle of Pearl Harbor and the subsequent events, they could have made an outstanding movie. Even a remake of Tora! Tora! Tora! would have been wonderful given the advances in special effects, but instead they chose to jam about two years of warfare (from the Battle of Britain to Doolittle's raid) into a three-hour movie, and subjugate the whole thing to a convoluted love triangle.<br />There were obviously some concessions made to keep the movie to a PG-13 rating, and I can't really complain about that; the director did the best he could, and made some nice decisions to portray the horror and confusion of the attack, while still limiting the gore.<br />Why do people keep casting Ben Affleck for these roles? Am I missing something? Josh Hartnett wasn't terrible (at least he was believable at times), and I will never complain about seeing Kate Beckinsale, but Affleck tries too hard to be emotional throughout the entire movie, and you can tell he's trying. His performance was downright hammish. He makes a good cynical smart-aleck, but most intense emotions elude his range.<br />There are a couple of scenes in this movie that do stand out as excellent portrayals of history. This is especially true when Ben Affleck finally gets into the war with the RAF. The romanticism of the battle is immediately erased with the stark reality of what he has just entered. The battle scenes in general are very well-done, especially considering the constraints that the PG-13 rating requires, along with the variety of combat that was filmed.<br />As a whole, the DVD contains some interesting materials, including some historical stuff and a \\"making of\\" featurette, which make for some interesting viewing.<br />Bottom line: A subpar movie with a few good points and some solid extras included in the box.
038572179X|3.0|The language in this novel is wonderful, however, it is a slow story.  I found the story similiar to Birdsong but not as good.  I don't think this is a novel I would recommend.
068483605X|5.0|I chose to read this book for my 10th grade honors English. I was surprised at how great of a book it is... there is alot more to it than battles (although the battles are awesome)... Adams has crawled into the minds of Rabbits, and how well he does it. The story begins with a rabbit having a strong premonition of danger. They gather as many rabbits that will come with them and set out across the plains of England. They have to outwit predators, people, and other dangers like rivers to get to... well, they don't know where they're going! However, they soon catch sight of Watership Down in the distance, and head for it. They soon build a warren and try to live in peace. However, they find they have another problem to face when they realize that there are no female rabbits! They have to raid a terribly war-like and horrible warren to get them, and the accounts of battles for the rabbits to escape with their lives are enthralling! Only later do they learn what has happened from the home they left...<BR>   I definitely reccomend this book to anyone who can read it. This is a great story that nearly made me cry at the end ( and I'm a guy so thats pretty tough!) READ IT!!!!!!!!!!!<BR>   ...
B000094A6A|5.0|Will Ferrell is absolutely hilarious.  I love comedies, especially ones with SNL actors and this is by far the funniest movie I have ever seen.  Can't wait til the DVD is released.  Can't wait for the next Will Ferrell movie.
068483605X|5.0|Some ten- year old brat wrote a front- page review saiying he couldn't understand it and obviously didn't finish the book. Being it that he can't even spell, it's not surprising a twit like him would lose interest so fast. I think the book grips you very quickly, and once it has you it won't let go. Adams does a wonderful job of writing the story from a rabbit's point of view. The raids on Efrafa to get does to start their new life are absolutley riveting. The legends of the great rabbit El- ahrairah are hilarious ( and very similar to those of Brer Rabbit.) Men are also displayed as enemies of rabbits and we humans have a mirror held up in front of us so that we see the bullies we sometimes are to living creatures. The book is surprisingly complex, but you don't have to read it from a point of allegory or anything deeper than a great story.I sure didn't. I highly recommend this book to anyone who can read ( except for that snot nosed illiterate on the front page.)
B000089CKH|5.0|Most people hardly know Nada Surf, and those that do only remember &quot;Popular&quot;. That's all I knew! Until, I heard &quot;Inside of Love&quot; on a college radio station. I immediately ran out and bought the CD and it's been in my regular rotation since then...that was 4 months ago. The album is full of great melodies and vocal harmonies as well as just darn good songwriting. The production value on this record is great, similar to the Proximity Effect, in which, I could say this is a great progression for these guys. You can tell the maturity in their song writing and that their vision is beyond puberty. Highlights include Inside of Love, Killian's Red, The Way You Wear You Head, Blonde on Blonde...but it doesn't matter. The whole album is stellar. Buy it!
B000055Y12|2.0|First of all, I am a huge hitchcock fan. If you are as well, definitely check out this film. If not, I would certainly check out others of his first, or even skip this one alltogether. <br />The main problem with the film is that there are way too many characters and none of them get fully developed. Also, with the exception of a few scenes, the audience never really gets the sense that anybody is in danger and thus causing the audience to not really care. It is long and the ending is just plain bad. It seemed like they could have changed a few things and wrapped up things about a half an hour earlier. The first hour or so is pretty cool, but the film tends to drift off, with only a few inspired moments. <br />The film is slow moving at times. The fact that all the actors are speaking english and at times choose to use an accent is a bit distracting as well. <br />Also, the film will build up a little suspense with one of the many subplots and the next scene will be 3 days later and we will hear about how the issue was resolved with some boring dialogue (including the ending that was used on the DVD... Ill get to the endings in a minute). <br />That being said, there were some great scenes that fans of hitch will enjoy. I thought the film started out great. The scene in the hotel was great (getting the briefcase). The ending shot of the Cuban girl being killed was especially great. Unfortunately it came a little to late and I was not too focused on the film. <br />The DVD is great. Included are the 3 propsed endings (as I have mentioned the horrible ending). None of them are really very good at all. They are basically excuses to wrap things up, but still, it is very interesting. Also the Leonard Maltin piece on the film is interesting. <br />All in all I gave it a 2 star rating worth checking out if you are a fan. I feel that if this were NOT a hitchcock film, it would not get the attention that it does. Definitely see Rear Window, Psycho, Strangers on a Train, Frenzy, North by Northwest, Shadow of a Doubt, To Catch a Thief, Vertigo, Lady Vanishes, 39 Steps, etc. first.
B000002N3J|4.0|Madonna has such a huge catalog of hit singles, to put all her greatest hits one cd (prior to \\"Ray of Light\\") would have been virtually impossible. I thought she did the right thing by putting all her slow songs (at the time of the release of the record) on one cd. I haven't listened to this cd in a long time and just threw this into my stereo recently. I still don't know what to think of Madonna's collaboration with Massive Attack on Marvin Gaye's \\"I Want You\\". I haven't heard the original version so I can't compare the two versions. Maybe I am just not feeling the song. Why there has to be two versions of \\"I Want You\\" on the cd is beyond me. One is enough for this listener. As much as I like \\"I'll Remember\\" from that forgettable movie \\"With Honors\\", the song has to be one of Madonna's cheesier ballads (next to This Used to Be My Playground\\"). On the brighter side, \\"You'll See\\" and \\"Take a Bow\\" are probably the strongest tracks on this compilation, along with \\"Live to Tell\\" and \\"Love Don't Live Here Anymore\\". Although I enjoyed \\"Something to Remember\\", I thought some of the songs (namely \\"Forbidden Love\\", \\"One More Chance\\", and the title track) were pretty forgettable to me.
B00000K19E|4.0|This is a very good Sci-fi movie, but it takes forever to get to some action.<br />Neo:He is what Morpheus and the others, belive is the one.  He is just a normal guy, that works, but the agents want him for some reason.  When he decides to join Morpheus and his gang, he realizes how hard, strange, difficult, and unbeliveble the truth can be.<br />Morpheus:He has been serching all his life for Neo, whom he belives is the one.  He is the leader of a crew that goes up agenst the odds in the real world and the vurtual world.  Altho he's doinf quite good, his crew keeps on dying to agents, in the computer world.  But the crutial question is this: is Neo really the one?<br />It took a real long time for me to get into the movie.  This movie really didn't have a plot, and it took so long to finally see some action, which was why I gave the movie 4 stars for starting slow, but ending with a bang.  If you love sci-fi, then by all means, check this out, but if you love action, just expect to sit through the first hour, whaching nothing but talking.
B00006RU5B|5.0|This album is really, really awesome.  I know it sounds obvious, but this really is a perfect mix of both Rage and Soundgarden.  The funny thing is, while you listen to the opening music (before Chris comes in), you can almost hear Zach rap-screaming over the music in the back of your mind.<br />Tom Morello is one of the most unique and creative guitarists i've ever heard... he is almost like a techno DJ, using alot of effects and sounds, without repeating the basic scales all rock guitarists know nowadays.<br />Cochise - powerful and an awesome opener<BR>Show Me How to Live - another nice song, their next single<BR>Gasoline - very heavy and rage-like<BR>What You Are - eh... it's an ok song<BR>Like a Stone - mild song, incredible guitar work by Morello<BR>Set it Off - good song<BR>Shadow on the Sun - One of the best on the album, awesome guitar work<BR>I am the Highway - not one of my favorites...<BR>Exploder - another one of the best on the album<BR>Hypnotize - different from the rest, a little more techno-like but a good song<BR>Bring 'em Back Alive - Great song, very rage-like<BR>Light my Way - The last good song on the album, i likt this one alot<BR>Getaway car - not too great, IMO<BR>The Last Remaining Light - Good closer, but not one of my favs.
B00005RYLE|5.0|When I first heard of Evil Dead, it wasn't in some upscale, fancy movie mag, like EW or Rolling stone. I heard about it from fans of the other horror films I liked; Night of the living dead, texas chainsaw massacre, etc. They said it was one of the few films which was made up of every element that stuck out in these other pictures and still stood tall to the original source material. In terms of entertainment, the film is a 10+. In terms of filmaking, its a little lower. the film was Raimi's first attempt at a motion picture, and he didn't have a lot to work with. The make up is masterfully implemented by the other worldly camera, a charecter in its own. If you care even slightly about horror, see this and the 2 sequels.
B00005JLXE|2.0|Was this movie all that good? Maybe if aren't a critical viewer of movies.<BR>Personally, I didn't like the movie from the lead actor on down. For me the only bright spot was Collin Farrell and Michael Duncan's characters who acted with the type of over the top emotion that is needed for the way the movie felt. It really made Affelck's minimalist acting stick out all the more.<br />Yes, it tried to have a dark, brooding approach to itself, but it failed miserably mostly because of Affleck's minimalist acting. I do like him as an actor, but the role required someone harder and with a greater range of believable emotion. When he acts an emotion in this movie, you SEE him acting it. One of my favorite acting quotes is from James Dean. \\"Don't act like your drinking a drink. Drink the drink.\\" In almost every scene it seemed like he was ACTING with someone, and not there doing the things himself.<br />And to those that say it sticks closely to the comic, I'm going to point these facts out. Matt Murdock was a GOOD lawyer in the comics. The way it's portrayed is that he acts as the Daredevil because he isn't a good lawyer. Not to mention the fact that he never questions himself in the comics (this Daredevil asks \\"Why me?\\" so many times you start wondering yourself if he should be doing this). I could get more into the innaccuracies, but I won't. It was a special effects movie, plain and simple. If you're looking for good acting, look else where.<br />In all, A for effort, but it falls very short as far as the lead character goes. When you can feel wheels turning in the actor's head, it makes the movie long and tedious.
B000089RVX|5.0|Finally....it has been about three years since I bought a CD and liked EVERY song... the first time I listened, I wasn't sure... but by the second listen (on a one hour road trip) I was hooked... I've been listening non stop now for two weeks. (I need a new CD already!) I just had to get on line and let you all know, this one is amazing! I am not into \\"dark\\" music, but the combination of the lead singer's voice, and the rockin' guitars, are simply fantastic.  Beautiful... []jammin. I would pay full price for this CD again.
0767840135|5.0|This movie has a great mixture of art, music, and performance to keep even the most belligerent person thoroughly entertained. I am only 16, but I found this movie to be simply outstanding, far above and beyond anything else you will ever see. With only the exception of one of the other fine Cirque Du Soleil performances. I have personally been to only one of there shows, Varekai, and it was awesome to say the least. So in conlusion I would highly recommend this or any other Cirque Du Soleil movie no matter how sceptical you are about its quality of content.
B00008J4P5|3.0|The White Stripes are a pretty good band and this is a pretty good album. The album starts off excellently, the first four songs work extremly well, however the momentum could not be sustained and the next six songs are patchy at best while the last track on the album 'It's true that we love one another' is an annoying twee attempt at britpop.
B000005H4H|5.0|Im just discovering jazz, but &quot;Little one&quot; is one of the most relaxing songs Ive ever heard. The sensation of peaceful and the relaxatation Ive experimented while Ive been hearing it, is like being alone on the beach at the end of the day with the red sky over the quite sea.
0375707972|5.0|This is a masterful work of art, and possibly one of my favorite books. Set amid the tumultuous times of post-war Germany, 15-year-old Michael Berg meets an older woman, Hanna. They begin a relationship that consumes the young boy, and profoundly influences his life. This relationship is interrupted when Hanna disappears. Michael only finds her again while he is a law student, and she is on trial for complicity in several of the Nazi crimes as a secret Nazi SS agent. <br />This book shows an astounding amount of poise and insight, depicting the tremendous guilt and shame associated with the holocaust. The relationships between the perpetrators and the victims are discussed, along with Michael's personal guilt for loving a woman who was capable of committing such terrible crimes. This book is a quick read, and filled with incredible wisdom, and individual sentences that can stand alone as profound declarations that ring absolutely true. This is a great book, which acknowledges that the holocaust can never be truly rationalized, or comprehended, but only discussed as \\"truth\\". A fantastic piece of literature!
B00001U0DP|5.0|This movie is so powerful.  I have watched it over 20 times and I still cry.  I spent a semester doing extensive study on the holocaust and this movie really captured hope and love which were still present in this tragic time of our world.
B0000027I6|5.0|This recording still causes the hair to stand up on my arms.  Quite amazing.  The songs flow and ebb so easily, and tie together in one big ear theatre.  Every song is strong Perfect Sense is great... you just have to hear this cd.  Pink Floyd aside, this is a great RW cd.
6304428928|5.0|I was really young when I first saw this movie, but it made me feel compassion for people with special needs around me, and made me a lot some sensitive to the subject of handicaps.
B00006RU5B|5.0|This is ear candy of rock and roll punch.  From the start to the finish, songs like 'Show Me How To Live' and 'Gasoline' and the barn burning LIKE A STONE will make your car stereo speakers beg for forgiveness.  Some funny guitar work in SMHTL and LAS will make you giggle with delight... I found myself laughing outloud at the strange guitar noises, but this is a good thing.
B00005JLEU|5.0|If you want an anime that is well animated and has a good message behind it (most anime do), than this is it! Spirited Away is the story of the young girl Chihiro, obviously (if you can read, you'd know this!), but she didn't turn out to be my favorite character.  It was Haku (especially in his dragon form!).  It's basically the story between 10 year old, whiny Chihiro who gets trapped in a spirit world and she ends up falling in love with the Kouhaku River (Haku). It teaches the value of friendship, courage, and hard work.  I was glad to learn that when Miyazaki-san (the creator) went to Disney and they said they wouldn't edit any of it out, it was a good thing to hear. I can't stand when producers do that--if the creator wanted those scenes out, he/she would've never put them in it! If you don't like seeing a little bit of blood, don't buy it! Miyazaki likes to emphasis blood in all of his anime that I've seen (this and Princess Mononoke). All in all, this anime is a good anime that many people are sure to enjoy (I'm 15 and I did, my sister-in-law is 20 and she did).
B0000025ZK|4.0|This is a great record.  But not a classic one.  For that go to dg's first solo cd called Dave Gilmore.  but it is very enjoyable.  I love the song MURDER.  You really hear a passionate DG, and sometimes he doesn't sound passionate, but on this song he really sounds great.
B00003CXBK|5.0|I finally got to see Princess Mononoke b/c a friend of mine let me borrow it and let me tell you, it's awesome! The animation is great, the characters are awesome, the whole storyline is sweet!  There is a good message behind it--not to mistreat nature.  Of course there's blood and mild language in it, that's why it's rated PG-13, don't you think? Of all the characters, the wolves would have to be the best! Word of advice--if you want you younger kid (hey, I'm 15, not a kid!) like 7 or so, and you want them to watch a kiddie anime, may I suggest Pokemon? Maybe even Hamtaro? Hayao Miyazaki-san is a genius! He likes to emphasis blood, but he has a good messange in his creations. If you want to see other anime by him, I deffinately suggest Spirited Away (and this of course)!
B000002U82|5.0|Look there are certain recording that just ecapsulate certain time periods and feelings and when they age they age like wine and this recording is one of them.  I have boots of this recording before and after its release and nothing quite catches this recording as it was in this studio snapshot.  Quite wonderful.  Sort of like CLOSE TO THE EDGE by YES in a sense that it really is a classic that will never stop being a classic... they will be playing this one in a hundred years.
0156027321|5.0|This story was one of the most interesting and compelling that I've read in a long time.  The storyteller, Pi, pokes fun at himself and the situation even though it would be tragic for anyone, let alone a 16 year old to deal with.  When finished, I found myself wondering if there were any truth at all to the story...it was amazing. After a bit of a slow start,  I loved the imagery, even though at times it was grotesque.  I found Pi's faith in God and himself and life touching and thought-provoking.  I am recommending it to everyone I know.
B00006LI4S|5.0|I love the music, and I love the way that DG does SOYCD at the beginning, and his new song SMILE is great too, but all the covers of Syd tunes just sets this set apart, and to my opionion make it a great cd, but those in the camp that just want to hear commercial floyd may be upset, but relax and listen to Those SYD BARRETT tunes, they are great and DG does them total justice... remember Syd started PF...<br />I have returned to say more about this recording.  David seems very loose and ready to play.  Seeing the special items in the DVD such as him and his backup singers in the studio/boat Astoria going over vocal arrangements and seeing his deft gentle hand in instructing them is really an added treat that was totally unexpected... most extras are cold and boring or just plain stupid, but this addition to the mix was fantastic.<br />Again, if you enjoy Syd Barretts contributions to PF you will be in for a treat.  I have read a couple other reviews and seen some rather low star ratings, with the comment(s) like 'If you are expecting PF or classic DG you won't find it on this cd...'or something written similar to that.  I contend that this is really a true statement to how PF was started, or as close as we can get it through a surviving member of PF.  The songs are all crafted and sound fantastic.<br />This is totally worth your purchase on two different levels:<br />1.  It is a good recording of Pink Floyd and associated music.<br />2.  It gives a good brush up on a lot of Syd Barrett tunes that we didn't have up until this point.  {Plus, David Gilmore was a friend of Syd's just like Roger Waters was in art school, so he knew Syd before he actually joined PF.  Dave was a guitarist in the band called 'Jokers Wild' when recruited)<br />So, with all that said, go get this and enjoy.
B00008S2VG|5.0|This is perhaps one of Madonna's best, at least it ranks in the top three among Madonna's albums.  It is at the top along with 1998's &quot;Ray of Light&quot; and 1989's &quot;Like A Prayer&quot;.  All three of these albums have one thing in common that puts them on top.  Each one of these albums are so deeply personal for Madonna.  &quot;American Life&quot; is more reflective of her days of &quot;Like A Prayer&quot;, when she wrote about her family and her husband.  Madonna does the same thing on &quot;American Life&quot;.  At the same time Madonna sings of the struggles of these issues in her life, &quot;American Life&quot; also reveals that Madonna has a sense of the happiness she has found as a result of moving on with her life.  Madonna has evolved as a mature singer with a new sense of who she is and where she is going.  Madonna will always have a hit album when she chooses to write about topics that are so ultra-personal as &quot;American Life&quot;, &quot;Ray of Light&quot;, and &quot;Like A Prayer&quot; were.  &quot;American Life&quot; is the &quot;Like A Prayer&quot; of the 21st Century.  I would recommend this album to anyone who just wants something good to listen to.  You will not be disappointed.  It is a must have for any music collection.
B00008BXJF|5.0|KC just tries to blow you out of the water after lulling you to sleep numerous times on this effort.  Dangerous Curves is indeed dangerous.. and super groovy.  If you own any KC outings, this is a must have, new or old fans of KC.
0780020685|5.0|For anyone who is interested in samurai epics, or for those who are just looking for a enthralling story, Seven Samurai is just what you need.  Akira Kurosawa was a master of his craft, and nowhere is it more evident than in this 1956 masterpiece.  It's no wonder Hollywood remade this into a western in The Magnificent Seven.  The story is superb, gathering a rag-tag team of ronin together to protect a helpless village from brigands.  The visuals are phenominal, even considering the period in which it was produced, and the sound is great.  One slight downside to this DVD is that it only comes with a mono Japanese soundtrack, so you'll have to read subtitles for three hours, but trust me, it's well worth it.
B000006TRV|5.0|This cd, with its songs of pain like MOTHER and ANOTHER BRICK IN THE WALL and RUN LIKE HELL are full of pain and alienation.  Yet the art of it, the wonderful guitar playing of DG, the music held its own and made this cd a very much loved classic.  The balance between art and pain is kept within the lines of the canvas and the listener can relate... the lines get blurred later on with the release of THE FINAL CUT and solo R. Waters works like Pro's and Con's... but here in 1979 they were perfect.
0345333853|5.0|I bought this book after seeing the miniseries. I was completely blown away. The way the author describes every character makes you feel like they are real people, and that you know them. I've seen many movies about King Arthur and the Knights of the Round Table, and I have always loved this story, but there is none that compares to this one. Marion Zimmer Bradley has made me believe this is the real story, the true legend. I really loved this book. It has everything I could ask for: love, lust, treason, myth, wars, faith, etc...
B0000025ZF|3.0|i love this album as much as I don't.  I can't figure out what exactly I am to feel about this record by the lyrics and feeling.. and that is what makes the cd so good, the feeling that you are feeling while listening to the music.  You get bombarded with feeling.... and at times it is too much, at times it is not enough and leaves you wanting more... but, something about it is not total... not sure what it is, the song MOMENT OF CLARITY is so darn powerful... I recommend it, but I am not sure I can fully endorse everyone will enjoy it.  One weakness is, Roger Waters screams like a banshee through most of it, and whispers throughout the rest, with little singing inbetween.  Good for effect every now and then, but this whole record seems to be missing the nice voice to sing the INBETWEEN parts, and maybe that is what Dave Gilmore gave to pink floyd vocals... I like the record, it is great, but not great.  O forget it.
0375422307|5.0|I have never given 5 stars before.  But I just love this one too much.  Here's why:<BR>(1) This is very funny comics, as good as the best strips in U.S. papers.<BR>(2) It's sad in a non-formula, non-manipulative way.  Purely human.  Said from the heart, touching the heart.  (Yeah, I know, it's a Persian saying.)  The scene in the end, the last frame, what an ending!<BR>(3) It's straight to the point in its analysis, in a way few &quot;current affairs&quot; books on the Iranian Revolution have managed.  This comic book rightly shows that the 1978-79 revolution was leftist and democratic in nature.  The Islamic Republicans did not take power and the Cultural Revolution did not take hold until some major struggles and purges in the 1980-82 period.  Satrapi shows how the war with Iraq became the pretext for the religious right's power grab.  (If this sounds familiar to the Americans, it's unitentional!)<br />I can go on listing reasons.  This is such a unique piece of work.
B00004U8PA|5.0|when i first saw this movie i thought it was stuppid but now i cant get enough of it i dont know what iw ould do without it.
0792844882|3.0|Trashy flick about Las Vegas Showgirls (DUH!), but a great place to see Elizabeth Berkley and Gina Gershon in all their glory.  Both ladies make a great effort to get something out of the script and characters (with Gerson winning hands down) but in the end the film is empty and void of any characters you would ever like in real life.
B00008HCCF|5.0|After having listened to the Grammy-Award-Winning album practically daily for over a month, I decided to take a chance on the live performance from New Orleans. I found it to be an excellent decision! Ms. Jones seemed very much at home in the small venue club atmosphere and reminded me of a combination of Billie Holliday, Coco Taylor, and Etta James. Her delivery is flawless and her musicianship is peerless. This is a must have for any collection. Timeless!
B000067F7Q|3.0|This album is brutal, very metal, i suggest getting this last in your collection, get Wage of Sin first, or Burning Bridges, this just isnt as good. Best tracks are Cosmic Retribution and Aces High(Iron Madien cover)
6304698526|5.0|Steve McQueen (R.I.P) is a talented individual when he is driving a Mustang with a STEEL DEMON molded insided the engine. One scene in the film you literally see his back tires change in this weird uneven shape like in the CARTOONS! I like the artsy beginning of the film exposing the cons and the goons who are trying to mess with the sytems of money transferring. Anyways, there are a few good car chases but if you listen to Steve's car it sounds so perfect for this film. I'm talkin' one car that can talk back with the pedal!... Enough bout the car! The movie is about protecting a witness for an upcoming trial but the cops covering the testifier totally get burned and Steve McQueen is sent in. Scenes of dialogue ensue with McQueens character with other actors like Robert Duvall who plays a taxi cab driver!! This movie could have had a few extended scenes but overall I am glad with the finished product and I can't complain about anything except the ... flap DVD cases WARNER BROS. puts it's DVD's in to! Anyways if your looking for a cool film from back in the day of the groovy times than this is a film to check out!
B00005JM03|5.0|I just got home from thoroughly enjoying a preview showing of The Italian Job, 2003.  The theme is familiar,  the schtick is familiar,  but the story is completely different.   The new movie is to the old movie what the new Mini is to the old Mini.   Similar, but very different,  modern high tech verses basic seat of the pants...  and both are very entertaining.   I'm a long-time fan of the original Italian Job and will never get rid of my copy;  but I now have a new favorite movie and will be adding The Italian Job 2003 to my collectionn.   BTW,  the new version has a great sound track too and I'll be buying that as well.
B00005V3Z4|5.0|THIS IS ONE OF THE BEST FILMS I HAVE EVER SEEN AND I AM KEEPING A COPY OF THIS DVD TO SPREAD THE WORD AND SHOW THIS MOVIE AS MUCH AS POSSIBLE!!!!!!! That is the feeling you are gonna get when you are done watching this terribly underrated movie. I am not someone who takes critics in total consideration but on the cover of the film one critic states \\"IT'LL KNOCK YOU FLAT\\" and that is exactly what happened to me and some of the people I have lent this film to. Now you are probably waiting for me to explain to you the story or anything else but it is too good. IT's a movie that is so weird but so captivating that it grabs you and shuts you up. You get lost and you just wonder what in God's name is goin on with Donnie and why are all these things happening to him. I have watched the film over 15 times now and I can honestly tell you I still do not have a definite answer for the reasons of Donnie's misfortunes. This movie also contains an all star cast but I don't think that will matter at all in the end because the story itself is one that you will have disect and look through backwards, upside down, and through many different opinions as possible. I will not be surprised if future film directors state that Donnie Darko was one of the reasons why they got into the film industry because movies that contains stories like these are only called one thing...ART!
B00008977N|5.0|I was forunate enough to attend this concert in person and to view this recording on VHS stereo.    The precision and musicianship were astounding.    A friend &quot;borrowed&quot; by VHS copy and did not return it - but that's ok - it gives me an excuse to buy this version for the DVD features.<br />If you are going to have any concert in your DVD collection - this is it.    It has astounding performances by the band - with an extra bonus from Paula Cole before she cut her hair :)..<br />The theatrics and visuals are wonderful, sound clarity is great and the special effects are nice - not overdone at all.<BR> <BR>To be even handed - I did not like the &quot;fish eye&quot; camera work on &quot;Digging in the Dirt&quot; but overall it's great.   I highly recommend this piece.
0671027344|5.0|A Review by Kylee<br />The Perk of Being a Wall Flower is about a boy named Charlie and his friendships and new experiences in his first year of High school. He starts out with no friends and being very lonely then as the year goes on he gains new friends and is exposed to drugs, sex and death. By the end of the book you can defiantly tell he has matured by both the way he write and what he writes<br />This book was amazingly written, there are parts were it leaves you in suspense. For example in his letter dated January 4, 1992 he is talking about a New Years Eve party he went to and the crazy things he did it leaves you wondering what he's talking about then in the very last sentence he says that he never wants to do LSD again. He really improved in the way he writes in the book. In the beginning he seems like a very inexperienced writer and wrote in a very mixed up jumbled way. By the end he is able to clearly express what he is feeling.  <br />This Book was such a great book; I had the hardest time putting it down. In fact didn't I had to read it all in one sitting. Since I have read the book I have referred it to other people and they have come back and told me that it was just as good as I thought it was! This book so great that I think everyone should read it!
0375758992|5.0|Alexandra Fuller draws you into the world of the white African with a finely observed yet beautifully understated tapestry of life in the dying days of the bwana. Fuller's taut prose delivers a terrific insight into one of history's most misunderstood people, yet, at the same time, builds a universally inspirational story of  courage, humour and pathos. Don't miss this one.
B000089RVX|5.0|Now, I'm not a 'metal' expert, and I've never even bought a metal album.<br />but what i am is a fan of music, and female vocals especially. <BR>After hearing the single (bring me to life) on the BOX and MTV, i didnt really listen too closely, but thought it was a nice sound.<br />after hearng it more, i decided to go for it and bought the album. It's amazing. full of different styles.  There's something for everyone on this album, and every day i have a new favourite. I started off having My immortal as my favourite, then everybody's fool, then now it's Imaginary! <br />Since i bought this album, i searched for Evanescence on the net, and there are MANY tracks that arent on the album that are well worth listening to.<br />I cannot praise this CD enough! it's superb, not one bad track at all.  Can't wait to possibly see them live!
B00006LLNU|5.0|Not since Mahler, has music been created for which there are no words to describe the way it makes you feel.  This music has left me with an exciting feeling about this new genre of music, that sounds like Radiohead with less pop format, and classical music.<br />These amazing musicians have a wonderful way of capturing human thought, feeling and emotion into one style.  An orgasm of music.<br />What's next for them, and where is this going to take us?
0446608955|5.0|This was the first book I read by Nicholas Sparks. I liked how he made two very different teenagers fall in love. I think every teen should read this book because they can relate to the events that take place, while learning lessons about life. From reading this book I learned that you shouldn't judge someone by how they look, but by how they treat you and others. I also learned that I should give everyone a chance to be who they are and see the real them and to listen to my heart, not other people around me, because your heart never lies.
0800141660|4.0|To have Hugh Grant play the part of Edward was at first, seemingly awkward, but I grew to love all the character much more than in the book. All thought some of you may be irked that Alan Rickman (yes, Severus Snape) plays Colonel Brandon, he doesn't do too bad of a job. <BR>   Sense and Sensibility is, like Pride and Prejudice, a story taking place in the Victorian era, telling you of the caste system that often created catastrophic incidents. Such is the story of our own Sense and Sensibility. One one hand you have the Dashwood family, dignified and proud, but undeniably poor. There is no longer a Mr Dashwood as he has passed away. Therefore, the Dashwood's having no money (though it was supposed to be supplied by cousin John), move into a cottage. There Jane, the eldest meets Edward, a polite and handsome, yet uninteresting man who immediately falls for Jane. Jane also falls for him (her being the unadventerous type) and they are infatuated with each other. Problem: Edward is heir of a vast estate, and later, it's revealed he's already engaged to a snotty upstart. He is one who does not break promises, and cannot be cajoled into breaking it off. <BR>   Marianne, the middle sister is in love with Willoughby, a charming man who's not afraid of adventure. They fall in love, but unfortunately, it's revealed that Willoughby is involved in a scandal, and he marries someone for 50,000 pounds. Marianne is crestfallen, and falls into a state of moping loneliness.  But here steps Colonel Brandon. He reads to her excitingly, and they fall in love. <BR>   The movie paced quickly and doesn't fail to be &quot;Victorian.&quot; I recommend it for any fan/nonfan.
078322799X|5.0|When I first saw this movie in the theater, it just blew me away. Michael J. Fox was excellent as Frank, a guy who uses real ghosts to scam people into hiring his bogus paranormal investigations business to get rid of the spirits. There is a great cast and great direction by Peter Jackson. I had read that a few fews ago an extended cut of the movie was released on laserdisc with 12 minutes or so of extra footage, giving more time to the three ghosts, more time to Dahmers (the outstanding Jeffrey Combs) and making a better rounded story. The Powers-That-Be need to release this cut to DVD. DVD has been an excellent format for directors to see their movies as they originally intended. Jackson knows this. His extended cut of ``Fellowship of the Ring'' blows the theatrical cut out of the water. ``The Frighteners'' is one of those movies fans really love. As a fan, I would really love to have the extended cut of this movie released on DVD.
B00008S2VG|5.0|I cant say I was reluctant to buy this CD, but I can say I was a little skeptical..mainly because of the first single &quot;American Life&quot;, which is a strange song that totally does not represent the rest of the album.  Totally worth having in your collection...Madonna has never been stronger vocally, and the songs of this record are kind of a cross between the the spirtualism of the &quot;Ray of Light&quot; and the folk/electronic sound of the &quot;Music&quot; records.  A beautifully crafted record that totally works!
B000065V41|5.0|This is the best muppet movie of all time. It is funny, educational, and great fun. There are alot of jokes that only adults would understand. It is a great movie. If you are a muppet fan than I highly recommend this one.
0446608955|5.0|A Walk to Remember<br /> A Walk to Remember is a very romantic book with many real life experiences to be learned from it. This touching story takes place in a small town called Beaufort, located in North Carolina.   The main characters in the book are Jaime Sullivan and Landon Carter.  Jamie went to school but was never part of the &quot;in&quot; crowd.  However, her life took a major twist when she decided to help Landon (the popular boy). Their lives change completely as they fall in love and progress on their road to maturity.  <BR> This book stirred many emotions both positive and negative. What touched me the most was that Jamie, a simple sweet girl and Landon, one striving for reputation and popularity, fell for each other although they were two completely different people. Jamie teaches Landon many life lessons, seeing as her father was the pastor at her church and is around him a lot, since she said that she would help him in any way as long as he promised to not fall in love with her. He agreed to the promise thinking that it would never happen in his life time, but he soon found out he was wrong.  I thought it was amazing that she made him promise such an improbable thing when it eventually did truly happen.  <BR> This book is one of the best books I have ever read, it's very entertaining and believable because you can relate to your own life or past experiences.  It has happy times, sad times and times where you are just anticipating what will happen next.  This book had me flipping through the pages continuously and had my attention throughout.  On a scale of 1-10, this book definitely deserves a 10 and I would recommend it to the young female audience (teenagers), or anyone who enjoys reading romance books.
B00008DDXL|5.0|I was forced to watch the first one by my 4 year old daughter. I was hooked. Then I watched this one and I am purchasing the books. This is such a great story and as the collection continues to grow so the does the fun involved with it.
B000089RW0|3.0|This was an interesting concept, but not terribly scary or exciting.  Some nice visuals-cool cover pic.  Odd soundtrack though-40 year flashback with hip hop backing was a bit weird.
B00008PW3O|5.0|When I first reviewed the 1-disc version of this CD, I gave it 4 stars, docking it 1 star because I felt that some of Lindsey Buckingham's contributions were subpar.  Ironically, that's the same reaction I had 24 years ago to the album &quot;Tusk&quot;, which is now one of my all-time favorites.  While some of Buckingham's experimental stuff here can be jarring at first listen (and I still say -- he's no master songwriter), his music certainly can't be described as cliche or run-of-the-mill.  After a while, I found myself looking forward to some of the kookier effects and, quite honestly, some of these songs really do sink in over time.  &quot;Red Rover&quot;, though almost overwhelmed by the production, is actually a rather compelling song, the most moving of his contributions here.  And &quot;Miranda&quot;, which I disliked upon first listen, is now one of my favorite songs on the disc.  Even &quot;Murrow Turning Over in His Grave&quot; no longer affronts, and the urge to hit the skip button is gone.  In fact, the two wildly varying styles of Buckingham / Nicks eventually compliment one another if you give &quot;Say You Will&quot; a chance.  Stevie Nicks, of course, is the class act here, and she continues the personal renaissance she began on 1997's &quot;The Dance&quot;.  Her voice is no longer the unique instrument it once was (the harsh bleating now overwhelms its once quivering delicacy) but what she's lost in character she makes up for with a histrionic emotionalism that still connects with the material.  And its her material here that is the crowning jewel.  Buckingham has always been condescending in his assessment of Nicks' songwriting, but the truth of the matter is she is light years ahead of him, as any listen to this CD would prove.  This time out, she holds the mysticism to a minimum (&quot;Illume&quot; and &quot;Running Through the Garden&quot; are the only examples), preferring instead a more direct, accessible approach that both expands on Nicks'style and fills in at times for the missing Christine McVie.  &quot;Say You Will&quot;, &quot;Thrown Down&quot; and &quot;Destiny Rules&quot; are three of the best songs she's ever written, filled to their brims with hooked-ladened ear candy. &quot;Running Through...&quot; and &quot;Everybody Finds Out&quot;, on the other hand, are two of her best all out rockers in years, and her singing on these two songs has all the emotional urgency she's noted for.  &quot;Goodbye Baby&quot; is the exquisite ballad that closes the first CD in hushed melancholy while &quot;Illume&quot;, her reflection on 9/11, is actually the only fitting tribute I've heard because it doesn't directly, pedantically make cornball references to that day.  Instead, Nicks comes up with one of her best recent lyrics in evoking universal longing and sadness.  Here, her trademark mysticism is just what the doctor ordered.  The extra CD on this expanded edition of &quot;Say You Will&quot; is a real treat, too.  It's got two additional studio cuts, Buckinghams' quirky take on Dylan's &quot;Live Minus Zero / No Limit&quot; and Nicks' poppy &quot;Not Make Believe&quot;.  Here, she offers a rather pedestrian lyric, but the tune is another hook-filled delight that compliments the rest of her work on the CD.  Better still are the two live versions of &quot;Peacekeeper&quot; and &quot;Say You Will&quot;, both of which are superior to the studio versions because, although almost identical in execution, have the expected &quot;oomph&quot; Fleetwood Mac typically brings to their best live work.  Credit there must also go to the phenominal rhythm section of McVie and Fleetwood.  Thirty-five years later, they're still the rock solid base for this classic group.  One minor gripe about the packaging: while very handsome indeed, its rather clumsily designed and will take delicacy of handling to survive the years.  But the music inside?  That will survive the years as a pinnacle in the legacy of one of the greatest groups of the last century.  Never break the chain.
0694003611|5.0|My daughter received this book as a gift for her 1 yr birthday(She is now 22 mos old and still loves this book. We read it every night before bed). At first, when I read it, I wasn't impressed with it at all. But then, the more we read it, I became wrapped up in the story through my daughter's enthusiasm of finding the little mouse in the pages and realized the sheer joy of her learning experience through reading and imagination. The lines are very short so little ones won't be easily bored waiting for the page to turn and it is so much fun for her to find the little mouse in each colored page, to watch her put her little finger to her mouth and whisper 'hush' with the little old lady in the corner, and to point out other objects in the room. <br />The story is based on a little bunny going to bed and saying goodnight to various items in his room and with each turn of the page, the light in his room grows dimmer. '...Goodnight mush/And goodnight to the old lady whispering \\"hush\\"/Goodnight stars/Goodnight air/Goodnight noises everywhere' and with that the room is dark and the bunny is fast asleep. The book alternates between color pages and black & white pages during the story. The pages show full color the little bunny's room where a little mouse hides in different areas and is waiting to be found by little searching eyes.  Then the pages alternate to black and white that show other items that are found in the room that the bunny says goodnight to. <br />I have also found that if my daughter is hyper before bedtime, this book helps calm her down through the repetition of saying goodnight, by lowering my voice with each page that we turn and it actually helps prepare her for bed just like the bunny.<br />This is a very short, very colorful and very fun book for little ones. I highly recommend it.
B000002IKR|5.0|yes the title says it all. this is the very first album of one of the greatest and underated bands ever in the history of music. they were such great musicians that one cant help but wonder why they didnt get more recognition. with chuck's screams, alex's wild solos (hes only 18 on this album!), greg's booming bass, louie's madman drumming, and eric's heavy-... rhythm playing, what more would you need in a metal album? still doubtful? let me put an end to your worries.<br />1.Over the Wall-the first testament song i ever heard. i knew i would be a testament fan after hearing this one. it is about someone who is trying to get out of prison. i also knew that alex skolnick would be one of my faves after hearing his wild solo<br />2.The Haunting-man this sucker is FAST. im surprised chuck doesnt have to catch his breath.that riff will haunt you for days to come<br />3.Burnt Offerings-dont let the intro fool you this song is heavy. chuck sings the verses with a sort of catchy rhythm. i think greg's bass kind of stands out on this one.<br />4.Raging Waters-this one has some pretty evil lyrics. but chuck says them kind of fast so you cant really hear them. man just dig that chorus<br />5.C.O.T.L.O.D.-FAST AND HEAVY!!! its a two minute thrashfest with some insane drumming by louie and greg's bass is turned up for this one. try not to destroy your room to this one<br />6.First Strike Is Deadly-kind of a weird intro, but an awesome song. man these guys just let it rip on this one! chuck sings with some of his highest screaming ever. the lyrics kick a** too<br />7.Do or Die-the only one chuck helped write (their first singer was steve souza of exodus) but its a dang good one. my mind just goes out of control when i think how hard it was to play this speedy number<br />8.Alone in the Dark-chuck uses a lot of singing types in this one. he sings with his regular voice, his deep voice, and he actually SINGS on the chorus. its awesome to see he sang with such melody back in 1987<br/>9.Apocalyptic City-a beautiful melodic intro. then it just goes into a heavy song that seems to be about a pyromaniac or something. alex's solo is AWESOME<br />this is defintely testament's rawest and fastest album. they would eventually branch out to some melody, but they would stay just as good. i think this is sort of like \\"Kill em All\\" by Metallica. its fast, crazy, made a name for the band, and both albums were the start of a great band. i actually think it is best to start your testament collection here since it is pretty raw. why this band didnt get more well-known is beyond me....
B00008K7AM|5.0|Ha ha ha ha ha ha.... I still can't stop laughing. This is really a funny movie even though low brow. I just don't know how Rob Schneider keeps on making people laugh. I can't wait for his next film. I won't spoil the fun of those who have not seen it by making further comments. See it and LAUGH! Ha ha ha ha...
B00003CWTI|4.0|I definitely agree with the reviewers who say that P.T. Anderson's Magnolia is extraordinarily self-indulgent. That fact, however, does little to diminish the quality of the film. It's a long, overly ambitious film that will test most viewers' patience and others' tolerance for bloated grandiosity. The film sharply divides movie fans as it very well should. <br />Paul Thomas Anderson would do well to attain a bit of subtlety, but he is undeniably a very good filmmaker. My biggest complaint against Magnolia is the tendency of the stars to overact - and overact they do. Nearly everyone in the film at some point gets to cry and shout \\"I hate you! I (f-word) hate you!\\" to someone else. When they're not overacting, though, the performances are very good. Tom Cruise, Phillip Seymour Hoffman, John C. Reilly and Melora Walters particularly stick out with their roles. <br />The film is well-crafted, beautifully shot, with interesting stories and characters, a solid narrative structure and features an unforgettable ending. It's not perfect, no. It's overly melodramatic, overly ambitious and slightly overlong. Even with these flaws, though, Magnolia is a dazzling display of filmmaking, and for those who appreciate ambitious cinema, it's (mostly) a joy to watch. If you have a high tolerance for excess, then check it out.
B00005JLWN|5.0|Christian Bale gives an unbelieveably moving performance in this criminally underrated little gem where he plays a \\"Cleric\\" in a post World War III world.  In this world, all of the population is devoid of any emotions for the sake of no war and human survival, and Cleric's are the ultimate fighting machines who keep the law while their own emotions are repressed as well.  When John Preston (Bale), the best Cleric there is, accidently misses his dose of his emotion supressing drug, he begins to realize what it is to \\"feel\\", and when he does he knows that all along he has been leading the wrong path.  Bale's moving performance is one of his best, along with his roles in American Psycho and Reign of Fire, but that is almost overshadowed by some of the best action/fight scenes to grace the screen since The Matrix.  Using the \\"gun-kata\\" technique, writer/director Kurt Wimmer creates an almost over the top showcase for some ultraviolent fights mixed with incredible performances from Bale, Taye Diggs as Bale's new partner, Emily Watson as a doomed sense offender, and Sean Bean who, even in a limited role, plays a very pivotal part nonetheless.  What I can't understand is why Equilibrium didn't see the release time it deserved.  It was only released in limited theaters which I can't understand why.  I found 2002's big \\"future shock\\" film Minority Report every bit as good as Equilibrium, albeit more fast paced, and I would have liked to see how it would have done had it gotten a bigger release.  My only complaint is about the DVD itself, besides Wimmer's commentary, we get a five minute segment with some interviews and various trailers (including one for Quentin Tarantino's upcoming new film Kill Bill) and thats it.  I would have liked to see a documentary on the gun-kata fighting technique used in the film, but oh well.  All in all, Equilibrium is a more than solid sci-fi dystopia portrait, and it is criminally underrated and more than worth seeing.
B00008O0WN|5.0|I can't imagine why some people were lukewarm about this movie.  Not only were the effects great, but it was one of those rare movies where I couldn't predict what was going to happen next.  Especially the ending!  Wow.    Very very highly recommended.
B0000942LT|2.0|This album is the worst.  This is way unexpected from Staind, Every album has always been better than the previous one(i.e., Break the Cycle was better than Dysfunction, and so on.)  This album does not have the same kick as the other three have.  There are just two many slow songs(love songs), I have always liked Staind for their music; exciting and dimensional.  But this album is not worth the money you might want to spend.<br />I will only give this album 2 stars because it still does have about 2-3 songs that are good.  The one song that i do think has the most kick is of course the new single, Price to Play.  Almost everyone has heard this song and i wish the other songs would be just like this one.
B000008LIX|4.0|TROUBLEGUM is a deceptively good album.  Deceptive, because at first listen it sounds quite like a guy screaming his guts out while a rabbit repeatedly runs up and down a guitar that has been turned up to eleven.  But after a few plays it started to grow on me.  Following a few more listens, I started thinking things like: \\"Say, those background vocals play really well against the melody the lead is singing\\", \\"Oooh, that was a clever bit of guitar there\\" and \\"Did I really just think that?\\"<br />Although TROUBLEGUM superficially sounds like a typically loud collection of noise, there is quite a lot of structure to the songs displayed here.  It's not just random and loud guitars; the melodies and rhythm are quite appealing.  It has more of a pop sound to it than the average metal album, but Therapy? make these two sounds go together extremely well.<br />Moving on to the lyrics and I honestly can't figure out why I like them.  On the surface, they're the standard teenage angst things that one would expect.  They involve loneliness, anger, hatred, and getting drunk as a prelude to beating the living daylights out of someone.   The fact that I couldn't really quote more than a couple of lines without violating Amazon's family website policy should let you know exactly what sort of words and concepts we're talking about here.  But it's not what he screams; it's how he's screaming it.  You can't help but want to shout along.  <br />The more I listen to this album, the more interesting it becomes.  If you don't like metal CDs because you think the style involves nothing more than the sound of an angry young white guy smashing a guitar to smithereens, then you may want to give this disc a spin.  TROUBLEGUM is madness tied up in a thick coat of method.  It's better than it sounds.
B00006GEXR|5.0|The talented actor behind great (and human) comedies such as \\"Four Weddings and a Funeral\\" and \\"Notting Hill\\" does it again with his unique style of humor, a style only paralleled by John Cusack on this side of the Atlantic. The story portrays the evolution of a self-absorbed bachelor who is taught a life-changing lesson by a twelve-year-old whose mom is walking a thin line between sanity and committing suicide. In the process, both (the kid and Grant) learn from each other, and find inside of them things they didn't know they could be capable of. All in all, warm and human, very touching. More than just a \\"good renter\\", a movie that will make you smile the rest of the evening (or weekend) with its positive message in times like these, when more and more people become \\"islands\\" to not have to deal or help with other people's very real problems.
B000002GVO|5.0|This album ranks in the top 10 of the greatest rock albums ever made.  From one of the greatest bands in rock history.  In the 70's there was KISS,  there was ZEPPLIN, and there was THE EAGLES.  If you don't like this, you don't understand what rock is about.  So many of THE EAGLES songs are great, I couldn't even begin to name them all.  This band is responsible for some of the greatest rock songs ever written.  This was a very defining album for the group.  They were huge when it came out, but after it's release in the summer of '76, their popularity went through the roof.  Many people don't realize that some of their best songs, were ones that never made a hit at all.  This band didn't have any &quot;filler songs&quot;.  Every song was always awesome.  THE EAGLES are the true saga of a great American sucsess story, and their legend will always fly on!
0803723865|5.0|My three kids love the Gruffalo. I highly recommend it for children aged between 2-7. Great illustrations too!
B00001ZWBQ|5.0|In my opinion, this is the best of the best DVD's.  The camera work, sound quality and all aspects of the performance could not be better.  Unfortunately, due to Maurices untimely death, this group will never perform together again.  This DVD clearly shows how great they were and will remain the cornerstone of my collection forever.
0345440900|1.0|As a pediatrician, mother and former nanny myself I write this review. I had heard about this book from a mother who's child was having trouble thriving because she only nursed him on a schedule. After I read this book I see why. This book is based mostly on opinion and not on facts which is very sad, it has alot if mis-information! Some advice is helpful, like reading your babies cries. (though this information can be found in various other places as well.) However the majority of the book is litteraly useless! The section on breastfeeding is the worst!!!! The facts are nursing is BEST for your baby, the vitamins in human milk have a much higher absorbtion rate then the formula she inadvertently pushes, the AAP says it is important to nurse your child for at least 1 YEAR, longer if you choose. Many benifits have been proven from nursing. You also don't need 16 glasses of water a day or to wipe yourself clean afterwards to avoid bacteria! The nursing section aside, babies need to be held, rocked, ect. A proven fact, babies who are held/picked up when crying cry less and are more trusting, have better bonds with their parents and are more self confident when older! Also, though not everyones choice, co-sleeping can be a safe alternative if you are careful. (Have a firm matress, keep pillows and blankets away from the child, don't drink/smoke, don't go to bed overly tired.) A recent study  showed that 50% of babies sleep with their parents for at least some time during their first year. Everyones parenting style is different, and it can get hectic at times but a baby needs comfort and contact! Even if you like this book please do your reaserch! As with any baby book I hear reviews on (whether good or bad.) the best adivce I can give is READ OTHER BOOKS TOO! Lots of books have good information PICK AND CHOOSE AND LEARN FROM MANY DIFFERNET PARENTING BOOKS, NOT JUST ONE!
B00005YW4H|5.0|This cd is just wonderful and the music is fresh and not like all the bubblegum pop you hear so much of nowdays!
B00005JLSE|5.0|Chicago is tHe bEsT mOvIe!!! Everyone should see it! I really didn't like Moulin Rouge but it was ok, i was kind of worried about not liking Chicago, but I LOVED IT!!! The songs are great and the cast is beyond awesome!!! I have to quote Velma on this: \\"Here's some advice direct from me to you,\\" GO SEE CHICAGO!!! I reccomend it for people who don't really like musicals because they just dont belt out in song when their walking down the street, the day dream most of it or their's a reason that they are singing. They aren't just singing for the heck of it.Catherine Zeta-Jones is a show-stopper, Renee Zellweger sings her heart out, and Richard Gere tap dances. What more could you ask for?
B000002UC5|3.0|I happened to be listening to the car radio the day this album was released.  The deejay advised he had just an hour ago received the station's new copy, and he had rushed to listen to it.  \\"There is one song on this album,\\" he said.  \\"The rest is okay, but there is one great song.  If this were released as a single today, it would shoot to number one immediately and stay there for weeks.\\"  Of course he was referring to Maybe I'm Amazed, a truly fine song.  This version never was released as a single -- and the truth is, the live performance version released in 1976 was not nearly as good as the original.
B00005R87Q|5.0|Ok guys, lets get a few things straight here.  This movie was not made to be a philosophical, mind-enhancing, intellectually stimulating orgy of eloquence.  It was simply an excuse to do some fancy camera work, with some really good looking cars on screen, and have alot of good sound effects that make your house shake when you pump up the sound system.  DO NOT buy this movie for the acting, or for the plot, or for the script.  Its one of those movies that you sit and watch for the simple enjoyment of watching a movie that will get your adrenaline pumping. If you don't enjoy random things blowing up, fast cars, and unrealistic street racing(this is far from a simulation((in the opening scene, the guys shifts 7 times))), you won't enjoy this.  But \\"if you want an adrenaline rush, it will be too large.\\"  The ultimate guy movie.  Enjoy.
B000002LQR|5.0|What an incredible album. All four members of the band completely shine. I actually saw the band last night and I have even more respect and love for this band. Chad Smith is an awesome drummer who doesn't get enough attention. Flea deserves all the attention he gets, because his basslines are so innovative and show his creative prowess. John Frusciante is a wonderful guitarist and his guitar work is always tasteful and melodic. <BR>As for this specific album, it's just chock full of great songs. It has my personal favorite, Under the Bridge. It also has Give it Away, which everybody knows, and Breaking the Girl, which is another RHCP staple. But just because I mentioned those don't mean they're any better than the rest. Really, you have to own this album.
B000001ELD|2.0|Gene Simmons seem to believe his solo album was the best, as well as the most liked. I would say that Simmons recorded the least exciting album of the four Kiss members. The opening \\"Radioactive\\" is the album's highlight. The Beatles sounding \\"See you tonight\\" and the quite rocking \\"Burning up with fever\\" are better than the average, but when it comes to the closing \\"When you wish upon a star\\", I certainly wish that Simmons would shut up - it's plain awful. The overall impression is that it's rather lame and the material is in fact quite weak more than occasionally. Simmons sure have a talent for business, but he surely think too much of his musical skills.
B00005JLRT|5.0|Star Trek is one of those things that will never go away. And i pray it stays that way. After the extended 'episode' like 'Insurrection' one would definitely agree that this franchise needed to kick it up a whole batch of notches to redeem itself. 'First Contact' gave us what we craved and 'Insurrection stole it back from us. This time 'Nemesis' hands it back with all the fixin's. The plot and character development has been bashed by some reviewers who dwell on their preconceptions rather than reality. The 'Nemesis' plot was outstanding with twists and turns all over. We know Shinzon (Captain Picard's clone) is bad, but it is interesting to see his development as he struggles with finding out who he really is, and who he could have turned out to be. He wanted life and liberation, but found out that both would come at a great cost. The action sequences are astounding and makes any recent Star Wars battle look like a watered down special effects puddle. Tom Hardy (Shinzon), acted like no other. He made Shinzon his own, and it was good. His performance is probably the most under-rated enemy performance of all time. He was breath-taking in his ability to portray curiosity, hate, and lust. I can't wait for another Star Trek movie!!
B000001ELF|3.0|Kiss fans are very loyal and Ace Frehley is many fan's favorite member. That might blur the judgement regarding this album. I wouldn't say it's a bad album because it's not. \\"Speeding back to my baby\\" and \\"New York groove\\" is both very good if not great, and \\"Rip it out\\" is sure an attractive tune. But overall it's not great and I strongly believe that the proper rating is 3 stars. And even the most dedicated fan can deny that Ace Frehley isn't a good singer.
B000096IB6|4.0|i am a media studies/television production degree student and although i know this doesn't add any more weight to my opinion i'd advise all serious movie viewers that were critical of this movie and called it juvenile, should give it a second viewing, whilst not comparing it to genuinely(but fun)juvenile movies like spiderman and xmen. look closely at the mise en scene and symbolism that permiates this film. for example a man dressed as the devil fighting a man in a church with pierced hands (stigmata) this really is a quite clever film that works on two levels much like the simpsons. watch it again.
B00000K3D4|3.0|I have to apologize to all the devout fans, but I just can't understand what you find so thrilling in this movie.  It's a sweet movie about a girl who goes through the traditional I'm-growing-up-and-learning-to-see-beyond-appearances, and of course a realization of a fantasy for any teenage girl who's ever had to babysit for her little brother.  But it's not a fantasy classic.  Assuming you're able to ignore the highly strange puppets and realize that there are exactly five humans in this movie, four of whom talk and only two of whom have any role whatsoever, you have to wonder why, if Jareth is so deeply in love with Sarah, he's sending machines to try to kill her and letting her go into danger.  And then there's the fundamentally creepy idea of a 30-something Goblin King being in love with a 15- or 16-year-old girl.<br />Maybe I'm missing the deeper meaning in this movie, but I just don't think it lives up to all the hype.
0345448898|5.0|This is, by far, one of the great books I have ever read. My brother read it before my and kept going on and on about how wonderful it was. He wouldn't shut up about it, and, so, I picked it up, and don't regret doing it a bit. By the time I finished The Golden Compass, I was captured.

B000002H97|5.0|This was my first Metallica Cd i purchased and let me tell you its one of my favs.
B00008OLYN|5.0|This new highly anticipated album blew my mind.  This music proves to the metal world that Opeth is the most genius black metal band out there.  The lyrics themselves could make any poet famous and the mixture of the melodic guitar parts with these depressing lyrics make it all the better.  How can a band make both amazing hardcore metal songs as well as soft, melodic songs that carry such a huge message?  I wish i knew what was going on in Mikael Akerfeldt's mind because all of his lyrics are pure genius.  This is the perfect CD to just put in your car and go driving far out in the country at night when you need to think about your life.  Pure genius.
B000003EUL|5.0|I had loved this recording from its appearance back in the 1960s. It was recorded during Richter's first tour of the US at a time when he wasn't very well known here. His tour changed that. I remember the buzz that ran through American music circles like an electric current at that time. I bought the recording then and immediately put it up there with my old Rubinstein and Schnabel recordings, and later the Gilels and Fleischer recordings. But when the change to CDs came (and I owned my first CD player in 1980, if you can imagine) I put it and my other LPs away and set about rebuilding my collection in the new format. Somehow I forgot about the Richter, never replacing it with a CD copy.<br />Only recently have I become reacquainted with this performance of the Brahms Second Concerto and I've fallen in love with it all over again. It's hard to describe how Richter mesmerizes with his playing, but he does - not always, but often enough that it begins to seem almost like a supernatural talent he has. One thing you always know is that every note is considered in context; there is never anything routine about his playing. And I'm convinced that he had a monumental musical intellect to go with his fantastic technique.<br />In this recording Leinsdorf is a very sensitive accompanist and the Chicago Symphony give him everything he asks for, especially Robert La Marchina, the superb cello soloist in the third movement; not long after this he left the CSO and became conductor of the Honolulu Symphony. Leinsdorf could be a maddening conductor, unduly fussy at times and at other times rather mechanical. I never quite figured him out, although occasionally his recordings soared. And this is one of those.<br />I was not familiar with Richter's Appassionata until this CD. It is certainly brilliant, even titanic, but just a bit mannered for my taste. I still prefer the classic Rubinstein recording, although I also like Goode, Kuerti, Gilels and others.<br />I would not hesitate to recommend this remastering. The sound if just fine. And that Brahms - oh my!<br />Scott Morrisonrecommend this remastering. The sound if just fine. And that Brahms - oh my!<br />Scott Morrison
B000002UAX|1.0|Although this CD gets a lot of 5-star reviews, I guarantee you that the &quot;SKIP&quot; and &quot;FORWARD&quot; buttons get a workout when even these reviewers play it.<br />There are so many songs here that it would be unrealistic to expect all of them to be good.  Back in the USSR is worthwhile though, but you can get this on greatest hits CD.
0307155102|5.0|THIS IS THE BEST BOOK FOR KIDS! I had this book when I was a child so I was very excited when my sister gave it to my son for Christmas!  He absolutely loves it and takes it to bed with him ever night in place of a stuffed animal!  My son is 2 &1/2 and has learned to count to 15 because of this book!  Every day he learns something new and is so excited to share it!  I am now buying this book as a gift for my nephew and several other Richard Scarry books for my son!  I would like to encourage you to but this book as it is one of the best purchases you can make for your child!
B00008J2DQ|1.0|This CD is a disaster. It sounds like one loooong song. I'm very disappointed.
B00005JM93|1.0|I just can't help myself.  I must dive into this \\"controversy\\" and inflict my opinion on anyone willing to read it.  First off there is a fundamental question  which has been at the heart of many a film debate.  Salom (120 days in Sodom) had a similar reaction, as did a clockwork orange, Natural Born Killers and on and on.  Is it right to illustrate the evil of the world by using an unflinching view, to show it in all it's gruesome reality so we are appropriately disgusted?  Does such filmmaking make us more sensitive to the suffering of others, or are we desensitized by seeing it as play acting?  Someone much more intelligent then myself will have to answer that.  I have taken many a film class and am told when writing my reaction I cannot simply say \\"It [was bad]\\"  but never has a phrase more aptly fit my reaction.  It truly [was bad].  Hard.  First off we are treated to an inane philosophy by what appear to be to older homosexuals (homosexuals play a large part in this film, I cannot see why) who say there are no good or bad deeds, just deeds.  Profound huh?  If this is the case then the camera work that soon follows is \\"just a deed\\" too, a bad deed.  We are shown the inside of a place called the \\"rectum\\"  Ho Ho Ho, there are a large collection of pathetic homosexual characters engaged in various repulsive acts that make me almost grateful for the gawdawfull shaky cam, rotating cam [stuff] that goes on for at least 10 minutes, it seems like days.  This is boring, pretentious, unoriginal and serves to illustrate the filmmakers are A. Inexperienced film school kids showing up there stogy old professors B. Pretentious snobs who think such nonsense is powerful instead of annoying and pointless.  C. Morons.  I would opt for C, that would be the least offensive. In addition to the shaky, rolling camera nonsense, the same phrase is repeated over and over and over and over and over again, the point is made and made and made.....you get the point.  A murder takes place, arevolting one, by this time such things are expected so it was not all that shocking, add to this the fact that it consisted of a fire extinguisher being smashed into someone's head, over and over and over again, on and on blah blah blah, what in the name of creation was this all about?  Who knows and who cares, not me.  After this opening scene we see what these guys are all about, it ain't much.  Ponderous camera work punctuated by gratuitous and badly filmed violence, the infamous rape scene is done almost exclusively by, what appears to be, a camera sitting on the ground and left running.  Of course we got to see a lovely young actress who has been so good in other films sexually violated and then her pretty face gets smashed to pieces.  That's entertainment?  Is the point that brutally assaulting a young women and destroying her face is, in fact, wrong?  Thank you so much for pointing that out, where would we be without such genius filmmakers to show us the way.  Better off.  The idea of showing the film backwards is good accept for the fact that it really doesn't work.   Memento worked because the pieces were scattered around in some order but to a have a linear tale told backwards is fundamentally flawed because, obviously we would have to have all the action in reverse, so the events are told backwards and filmed forwards then we jump to what would have happened before,,,oh who cares.  Turns out this young women was intelligent, kind and looking forward to having a child, nice touch.  Yes we have all learned a valuable lesson, don't rape people and smash there faces in....or something.
B00008G9JN|5.0|This is one of the better Tull releases prior to 'Heavy Horses'. Everyone is in fine form here, nothing to fault. This remastered edition shines in terms of clarity/depth. The definition is apparent on every track particularly in the vocal harmonies. Bonus track 'Beltane' from this period and also on the Tull box set is interesting. Second live bonus track 'Velvet Green' is very good, practically note for note. I for one, am glad for the bonus tracks as well as the long-overdue remastering. A must for any Tull fan.

B00005J9LZ|5.0|The PSB have long been my favorite group.  I first caught a sight of them on MTV, and ordered their first album, and liked it fairly well.  But it was their second album, ACTUALLY, that really did it for me.  From the first single released, &quot;It's a Sin&quot; to the follow-ups of &quot;What Have I Done to Deserve This?&quot; &quot;Rent&quot; and &quot;Heart&quot;, each song with its accompanying video was a real treat to listen to and watch.  I also got the special release album that had the remake of &quot;Always on my Mind&quot;, a special packaging that was a brief marketing item.  This album will probably stand out as their greatest, when they were at their height of both popularity and musical sophistication.  Their next album continued the sophisticated and subtle mix, falling a bit in subsequent albums.  But for the &quot;Golden Age&quot; of the Pet Shop Boys, nothing beats this album.
B00000GUZP|5.0|This album was - and still is - ahead of it's time.  Niles Rodgers and Bernard Edwards had dabbled in some of the sounds w/Chic.  Nothing sounded or sounds like 'KooKoo'.  &quot;The Jam Was Moving&quot;, &quot;Backfired&quot;, &quot;Jump Jump&quot; - incredible.  Blondie was innovative in their recordings, but I don't believe they could have pulled this off as a group.<br />Unfortunately, Debbie Harry was never able to come close to this unbridled creativity in her other solo work - though a cover of Teddy Pendergrass' &quot;Love TKO&quot; she did on Saturday Night Live was a missed opportunity to put to (then) vinyl.
0486278077|5.0|Oscar Wilde is a man who is obsessed by appearances. In this particular novel, he follows from the moment Dorian Gray sells his soul to the devil named beauty and youth, pleasure and enjoyment, to his death and he describes how someone who looks perfect, perfectly young, intelligent, brilliant, beautiful, moral and healthy is in fact nothing but a monster decaying in all possible immoral actions, deeds and ways just under the surface. It is a very strong criticism of victorian society that considers appearances as more important than real ethics and morality. He exposes the hypocrisy of such a society where a whole class of people are nothing but perambulating pictures of perfection hiding the mire and mud of crime and evil. We can also feel another dilemma in this book. Oscar Wilde's own dilemma who has to keep up appearances, the appearances of a well behaved, well educated and perfectly integrated man in this aristocratic society of his, and who yet lives a passion and a whole basket of desires and impulses that are absolutely rejected as crimes by victorian society. We know he will not be able to hide this deeper nature forever. But the book shows that no one can evade one's being exposed and rejected, condemned and sentenced to some punishment forever. There always comes a moment when one will be exposed and rejected. This shows how deeply Oscar Wilde must have suffered in his life. The painting is nothing but a mirror of the deeper self of Dorian Gray, but a mirror who will become one day his accuser.<br />Dr Jacques COULARDEAU, University of Perpignan.
0375758992|5.0|This is one of the best books I have read in a long time.  Ms. Fuller's voice is rich and intoxicating - just like the African countries she describes.  I recommend it whole-heartedly - from the front cover with that hysterical little face to the end.  Can't wait for the author's next book.
B000001FV1|4.0|While not as memorable as 'Low Spark', SOTFF does have it's moments: Evening Blue, The Title Track, Uninspired. The disc is a bit on the short side at 37.29 and the domestic 1st generation copies were average in terms of sound quality. The MOFI Gold version is light years ahead of any other version thus far in terms of you-are-there sonics. I'd wager it surpasses the newly remastered version as well. If you can find the gold version, grab it while you can, well worth owning.
0792846303|3.0|This is a great example of a so-so Carpenter film that otherwise shows us why we loved his older stuff.  The Fog is set in one of those quaint coastal towns that we think only exist in movies but actually do dot America's shores.  This one is about to celebrate its centennial, which means that all sorts of secrete will pop up.  The small town has an identity born of sacrifice - noble sailors died here when their schooner mistook some coastal signals and tore itself to pieces on the rocks.  Some, like a priest played by Hal Holbrooke, are old enough to know the truth - that those brave sailors were conspirators, sent to a watery grave for their silence, and waiting for a round-number of years to pass before rising from the grave to exact a vengeance.  As the town approaches its 100th year, and John Houseman's character warns us that bad things happen to the descendants of people who made money the really old-fashioned way, an ominous fog rolls into town.<br />This was a so-so film, though it shares that quality of all early Carpenter flicks that require you multiple viewings.  It was brave of Carpenter to devote his time to what amounts to an over-glorified ghost story, but he handles it well, keeping his ghosts appropriately vague (like a fog) until the near end.  \\"Ghost Story\\", which also starred Houseman, came out a year later, and was nowhere near as good.  Forget the arch and knowing wisdom of the \\"Scream\\" movies, nobody can sustain tension like Carpenter could, and certainly not without traditional shock devices.  And nobody, but nobody can deliver a parting shot like the one Carpenter swings at you in the final frame.

6304211740|2.0|The book Jane Eyre was assigned to me this year in 10th grade. It has moved from a homework assignment to my second favorite novel. Our teacher allowed us to view this film in class. In the beginning it is very good, the interpertation of Jane's traumatizing expericence in the red room was very well portrayed.  I believe that the actors were casted very well. Jane, Mr. Rochester, Mrs. Reed, St. John, all looked VERY similar to what I imagined them as. (The only thing that bothered me about Jane Eyre was her teeth. She seemed to have an overbite of somekind and one would think that she has braces or desperatly needs them.) The actors, Jane and Mr. Rochester, made the best out of the script they were given. They were very well paired. I do have several complaints though, I know that one can not transfer a book to film perfectly, but they should follow the story line. (spoiler-if you havn't read the book don't read this) The meeting between Mr. Rochester and Jane when they confess there love is to short and lacks the passionate speach and playfullness that the book has. When Jane is leaving Thornfield catches on fire, this happened later. Also in the film Grace Poole dies, this contradicts the book. Also they don't really explain how she hears his voice and how he heard her calling back- this makes the book seem less gothic. Also in the end Mr. Rochester only regained partial sight in one eye, not all his sight as in the movie. Besides the details the movie is resonable. I have only seen this one, but I have seen the beginning of the older black and white one which looks quite good. This movie is resonable. The settings are good , oh they also left out one of my favorite scenes when Mr. Rochester talks to Jane after they first meet in a chair and he tells her to move closer and pull up her chair.
B000075BFK|4.0|Although Trick Daddy didn't hit the mainstream until a few years ago he's been rapping for I believe a decade. 2Pac did lots of songs with unknown artists this was another one as at the time Trick was really nothing more than an underground Miami rapper. This was just the first one where the guy became famous after Pac's death. I don't know if these 2 were actually in the studio but both did this song. So for those conspiracy theorists just because Trick did a song with Pac doesn't provide any proof that Pac's alive because Trick was around before Pac's death

B00005QIPH|4.0|Everybody's calling every other band the \\"Saviors of Rock.\\" Well, I don't think they are, nor do I think they think they are. (Or at least, not when they started.) But that doesn't make them bad. Are they doing what so many others have done? Of course. Is their poor-boy image constructed? Who knows. But, constructed or not, I've tried to judge them on their music alone. (Actually, that's all I can judge them on. I haven't read any press about them, nor seen a video. I just saw that Spin named them Band of the Year, so I gave them a listen. And again, that being named Band of the Year does not reach back in time and taint their studio sessions and make them bad.) Anyway, all I know is that the music is infectious as hell. Have they changed my life? No. (Actually, no band has--but Pink Floyd's records have been the soundtrack of my life). And all you Old-School-Punk maniacs: because of the Stripes/Hives/Vines, I have been looking more into old-school punk/garage, and have been liking what I've heard. So these new bands are doing some good, right?<br />As to the critics crying \\"Savior?\\" Give them a break. I understan where they're coming from. The music world has been (and still is) so saturated with Britney, Christina, Nelly, Ja Rule, Justin, etc. Maybe they see a light in the tunnel. Are these punk/garage revivalists the best that have ever been? No. But, after crossing a desert, dirty/stinky water will taste like Evian. And the old-school bands can't be saviors because most of their best work is from the past. Semantically-speaking, unless they release a mind-blowing album right now, they can't be saviors. They're more like founders and inspirations. It's like reading Einstein's theories when he published them and calling him the \\"Savior of Physics\\" and then have all these Newton-heads crying, \\"Einstein's nothing. You wanna see some real physics...read Newton. This Einstein is just a poser.\\" Another bad metaphor: if you're drowning, anybody who pulls you from the water is going to be a savior.<br />My judgement? Good to Great music. Good to Great album. Good to Great band...
B00005JLRT|5.0|First off, let me say that if you are not an avid fan of Star Trek the Next Generation, you will probably be bored to death by this movie.  However, if you are, than this is a must see movie.  Great special effects, and they do a fantastic job of tying up the loose ends from the series.  The movie is more like an extra-long TV episode, but no less enjoyable.  For Star Trak fans, I highly recommend this movie.
078401213X|5.0|Pi was a great film, one of three hole in the head movies.  Released at around the same time as American beauty and Fight club, Pi is another movie that questions the intricacies of our world, but in this one, much less of a social question is posed.
B00009ATIX|5.0|With the way that movie storylines are these days, it was refreshing and elightening to know that a science fiction film that dealt with metaphysical and cerebral matters was being released around November of 2002 AD. Especially the fact that Kentucky native George Clooney was the lead actor in the production, along with the lovely British actress Natascha McElhone. In many ways, this was more entertaining and watchable than your average Star Wars and Star Trek film.<br />Much like 2001, but with some romantic overtones, Steven Soderbergh's Solaris is an interesting mix of metaphysical and cerebral science fiction, with a love story thrown in. Not only was the storyline very solid and multi-dimensional, the sets, the costumes, the special visual effects, and soundtrack were all beautiful. The actors and actresses did a remarkable job in the roles, along with the material they were given.<br />Based on Polish science fiction writer Stanislaw Lem's novel, Solaris tells the story of a 21st Century psychologist who receives a message from a scientist friend of his on a space station orbiting a mysterious planet named Solaris. Chris Kelvin, the psychologist is asked by his friend if he could come to the space station named Prometheus and find out what is going on. Apparently, some strange and unusual incidents have been occuring. <br />Still recovering from the tragic death of his wife, Kelvin journeys to the space station and discovers the fact that his friend has mysteriously died, one of the scientists is acting irrationally, and the other is frightened. While determining the cause of all of the events, Chris is suddenly visited by an image of his deceased wife. From there, Chris and the two surviving scientists determine that the ocean planet they are orbiting his a sentient form of life that is recreating the images of those from a tragic moment in their past. As to why this alien intelligence is committing these acts, remains an unknown factor.<br />I haven't seenAndrei Tarkovsky's 1972 version of the film, so I really can't compare this film with the older version. I can say this, it helps to read the book first before viewing the film. I can honestly say that I enjoyed Soderbergh's version of Solaris. Not only does the film stay true to Lem's book in some levels, it also paints an interesting picture in Freudian terms. It states an interesting fact about how well do we know other people and at the same time how well we know ourselves. In all honesty, this was probably the best film out of 2002! It may have the qualities of a science fiction art house film, but it is still entertaining. One that I look forward to purchasing on DVD this summer.<br />If you enjoy science fiction that makes you think, instead of the ususal shoot them and blow them up types, then you will be pleased with Solaris. It will make you think and it will astound your mind.
0060194995|4.0|To Kill A Mockingbird<br /> I really enjoyed reading the novel, To Kill A Mockingbird.  This book not only captured and held my interest, but I was also able to relate to and understand a lot of what the characters were going through.  I felt as if I could relate to this book because it highlighted and gave a realistic description of human nature and behavior.  <BR> One aspect of human nature that is shown in this book is how as people we are born innocent and blind to most of the wrongdoing in the world.  As time goes by, we are subjected to different people and situations and our so called rose-colored glasses become darkened.  The characters Scout and Jem illustrate this best.  As young children, they assume that everyone is good and no harm can come to them because they have never really come into contact with evil in their lives yet.  However, as the story progresses, they see, for the first time, prejudice, hatred and the overall ignorance of human beings.  In addition to this, the children got to experience the effect that these things can have on people, specifically how they can ruin and destroy many lives.  Usually, when hearing about racism or prejudice, we hear the more factual side of how people are affected, such as what rights they are being denied.  I enjoyed this book because it gave me insight on how people are really affected, how they feel, and how their lives are changed as a result of the injustices.  <BR> Despite the fact that this novel highlighted the evil nature of human beings, the author did not neglect to show that there is good in humans as well.  The good nature of humans is represented in this book primarily through Atticus Finch.  He is the father of Jem and Scout and a fairly well off lawyer in Maycomb.  Throughout his life, Atticus has seen the capability of humans to be evil, yet somehow he has not become cynical or lost his faith in the human race.  He understands that people are both good and bad, and Atticus does not look uponpeople with judgement.  He, instead, tries to see and understand the reasons that people are the way they are.  After reading this book I found myself trying to practice the moral values and ways of Atticus Finch in my own life.

B00008H2LE|5.0|Meteora is great.If you are a Linkin Park fan or if you are into nu-metal or hip -hop,you simply HAVE to go get a copy.<br />1.Foreward-This intro 's cool!<br />2.Don't Stay 5/5 It's one of my favourite songs in the album.Nice and heavy,I really love Chester in this one.<br />3.Somewhere I belong 5/5 You ALL know this one!It's great!Not so loud and heavy,but it's one of the best songs I have ever heard!<br />4.Lying From You 5/5 Oh,I adore this one.Mike's rapping is awesome...Chester's vocals,always perfect.And it's heavy!<br />5.Hit The Floor 4/5 The really heavy  one in the album,Chester screams in it really loudly...I like it a lot,but i have heard it over 100 times and maybe have got a bit tired of it..haha<br />6.Easier to Run 3/5 It's a strange song,not like the other ones.It's Crawling-style,but although Crawling is my favourite Linkin Park song,maybe my favourite song in the world,I don't like this one very much,for some reason.Stll good,though, and the lyrics are very nice.<br />7.Faint 5/5 Fast and great!You'll love it!<br />8.Figure 0.9 5/5 Probably one of the best tracks in the album.Chester finishes it with an awesome scream!<br />9.Breaking The Habit 4/5 It's a very nice song,I like it a lot,but not as much as the other ones in the album.It's just different.I like the lyrics in this one.<br />10.From The Inside 5/5 You don't need to listen to this song more than once to say &quot;I like it&quot;.It's great,melodic.<br />11.Nobody's Listening 5/5 Maybe some linkin park fans don't like this song because they are more into rock/metal than hip hop,but I simply love it.Can't get enough of it,the japanese flute sounds awesome and Mike's rapping is really cool.Finally,Chester's vocals make this song excellent!<br />12.Session 5/5 The instrumental one.Much better than &quot;Cure For The Itch&quot; in Hyrid Theory,I think.The scratching parts are awesome.<br />13.Numb 5/5 Great,a perfect song to end the album.<br />Finally,the artwork rocks and the dvd ,if youbuy the special edition,is really interesting to watch!<BR>BUY THIS ONE TODAY!
B000070WJE|5.0|Wow. As a brand new US fan of this cheeky Brit, I am bowled over by the quality of the songs in this collection. &quot;Feel&quot; is sensual &amp; addictive; and there is a song for every mood, and maybe a few you haven't felt yet! Guy Chambers was so much a part of this recording, it saddens me that they have parted ways, so ENJOY what may be their last collaboration and keep your fingers crossed...
0679745653|5.0|A more profound offering than I had originally expected.  The details are so richly expressed, and the characters and the events taking place are so intricately woven together, that by the end, everything is neatly wrapped up, which the reader can enjoy very much.<br />A short novel, one in which I finished in one day (a few hours-I suppose I might identify with some of the characters more than other readers, but I was thoroughly engrossed.), is the story of a man who remembers a girl whose path he had crossed.  He fell in love with her, and she was a traveler.  Many adventures later (and a lot of philosophical musings), the 111-page story comes to an end, and I found myself genuinely caring about the respective destinies of the characters.  This is something that I'd like to read and re-read again and again, might go on my top ten list.
B00008NG5V|5.0|Jack's first cd \\"Brushfire Fairytales\\" was great and he did it again with \\"ON and ON\\". The CD overall is more mellow and a bit different than the style of the first cd but it still is great. Brushfire fairytales was more acoustic where \\"On and On\\" has a more funky sound at times. It's definitley different than brushfire, but if you like Jack's caliming sound and thoughtful lyrics then you should like this one. It's a great buy. Cookie Jar, Wasting Time, Taylor, and Gone stand out as the CD's best tracks.
0380789035|3.0|This book was fun to read, but for some reason I never quite grasped the fact, until the very end of the book, that Shadow was a black man. It was yet another example of Gaiman's failure to describe the physical characteristics of his characters.<br />The only really big problem (other than certain pacing issues in the book) was the conclusion. We spend the entire story hearing about the Storm and when it finally arrives, almost nothing happens. There needs to be more bloodshed, more conflict, more chaos, because Shadow spends MONTHS following Wednesday around. Really, at that point we expect some conclusions.<br />SPOILER<br />One other small problem I noticed was the conclusion of the affair with the old man in the town. I can't remember his name off hand, but he was the one who drove Shadow into town. This was an interesting plot line (although it came out of nowhere), and a child-murderer needs to be dealt with in a slightly more permanent fashion than this.<br />One of the most interesting parts of the novel, to me, at least, was the idea of Odin's sacrificing himself to himself. This is a common enough story in Pagan and Abrahamic mythologies (Jesus and Mithras both were sacrificed to themselves), and it was interesting to see that Gaiman really did his homework on the issue. He understood the anthropology and mythology behind it, and he managed to write a whole novel with it as the main subtheme.<br />END SPOILER<br />Other than the slowness, it was a pretty good book with a poor conclusion. I recommend it. Worth buying.<br />Harkius
B00008WG3U|5.0|This album is great.  how amazing is &quot;13 stitches&quot;!
B00004Z4SD|5.0|When you first think of the name David Lynch, you would think more in the sense of R-rated, kinky, violent and vulgar films.  Not this one.  The Straight Story, an even cleaner film than his 1980 Elephant Man, could not be more G-rated.  But Lynch shows us here that he does not need to use his common elements to make a great film.  <br />The transfer:<br />Theres really nothing wrong with this transfer, although there shouldnt be, considering that it was made about 4 years ago.  You get a nice 5.1 surround, and clear picture, and a very wide presentation.<br />Thre supplements:<br />Nada.  Actually, on the whole disc, there is only 2 menus.  The only thing that makes this disc sold without a box is a trailer, and a little note from Lynch himself explaining why there isn't any chapter stops (sadly, for most this film would have to be seen in parts, unless your so comfortable in your seat you dont want to get up).<br />For kids?<br />Although this is G-rated, anyone under 10 would fall asleep in less than 10 minutes.  Forget children, most adults would not have the patience for this film.  But if your children do have patience, absolutly.  There couldnt be less wrong with this film.  A wonderful, warm hearted slice of life.
0671015206|5.0|I buy this book for my friends to read and enjoy. This work is based on statistical analysis of data about the habits of people who have accumulated wealth through hard work and entreprenureship. The data have been filtered and very well presented. This NOT a cheesy &quot;how to get rich&quot; book. Highly recommend his other book &quot;The millionaire's Mind&quot;
0385504209|5.0|The success of this book is that it's a fictional work that brings the non-fictional world into better focus.  As a story, it's fine and interesting enough to hold your attention.  I found myself staying up til the wee hours of the morning in a race to finish it, but I'll also admit it's not any kind of epic piece of literature.  It's a fun loving and informative summer novel.<br />The 5 star rating is for the fact that it opens the reader's eyes to topics in history, art, mathematics, and religion that might have been overlooked, but which are startingly true.  No matter how fantastical the background to the tale may sound, remember that none of the background is a work of fiction.  And for those disturbed by how the real world organization of Opus Dei is portrayed in the book, be aware that the organization's aspects depicted in the book are also true.  There are many legitimate books, websites and support groups available to confirm all the darker issues depicted in this book.<br />I'm convinced the author was more concerned about informing the world about all these background issues than about the fictional plot.  In this he succeeded.  This book has provoked many eye opening discussions amongst folks I know and for that I am eternally grateful.  Any book that can produce the amount of intellectual discourse and soul searching that I've recently observed deserves 5 stars.
0312119038|4.0|....cloistered in a psychological as well as a physical sense.<br />Karen Armstrong, a woman of prodigious intellect and talent, a woman who has written seminal books on the subject of religion, goes inside her own personal experience as a cloistered nun in Through the Narrow Gate.<br />It's not a particularly pretty picture, this story of her seven years immersed in a life full of bleakness, medical neglect, sexual frustration, and mindless negation of intellect. For someone of Armstrong's mind-set, that last privation must have been hardest to bear. Outside the walls of the cloister, meanwhile, the chaos of the 60s was raging, making the life within more inexplicable - and ultimately, irrelevant.<br />There is one bright, kind, and encouraging Mother Superior, however, who provides the necessary window of light, a person who provides Armstrong with both a reason to stay and a reason to leave the convent.<br />It's a blessing for us that she did leave and go on to live her life as a scholar, teacher and author. It's almost an equal blessing, however, that she endured those 7 years and writes about it so poitnantly; it makes her presence in the world all the more valuable.
B00003CXCK|5.0|This is one of the best and yet saddest movies that I have ever watched. It is definitely nice to know that someone had compassion during a time like that.
0786869143|5.0|This is definitely an interesting book. It views the 'luck' from a scientific perspective. By having 4 simple principles, everyone can increase the chance of luck. In fact, Dr. Wiseman demonstrates the people with luck having a common set of personalities that lead them to have more opportunities than others. Luck is not from your psychic power, it's more the consequence of how you behave and how you view your daily life.<BR>This book is similar to the \\"Millionaire Mind\\" by Dr. Thomas Stanley, which depicts the characteristic of being a millionaire. To be a better luck person, it's simple, just be more positive and using Dr. Wiseman's four principles.
0345347951|5.0|I think most people have missed the point of this great work.<BR>In this book, Clarke re-tells the old Christian-Islamic creation myth from a mystic point of view in a Science-Fiction novell!<BR>According to this myth, man has a divine gift in him that allows him to finally join in with God , where as the Devil, though the archangel, made of fire instead of clay, can never reach this phase. Though by God's plan it serves His great purpose of making that final union of Man and God possible.<BR>Clarke takes this , wraps it up in a Scientific world-view, even explains the origin of the above myth in its plot's context, in the mean time makes fun of all the prosaic results of the very same myth, and finally portrays the union in perhaps the most fascinating way ever told!<BR>If this is not masterpiece , I don't know what is!<br />He also gives us a hint at the very first page where he writes :\\"the opinions expressed in this book are not that of the author\\".<BR>Ofcourse they're not!<BR>Clarke is a scientifically minded atheist, who uses the very core of modern religions to write a science fiction master piece!
0060931736|5.0|Miss. Jean Brodie is a teacher of girls in the Junior Department of Marica Blaine School in Edinburgh. Even a cursory reading will alert anyone to the undeniable fact that she is in her \\"prime\\". This is the solemn refrain of the novel. What this means is left, largely, to your own discretion.  The surface narrative, insofar as there is a surface, charts the influence that she has upon a \\"set\\" of five girls, the hand picked \\"creme de la creme\\" of her class, that become the \\"Brodie Set\\" marked indelibly by the imprint of her \\"prime\\". Funny and light, at the same time as being extremely dark and sinister underneath, it alerts us constantly to the illusion and refraction of truth in fiction and the inescapable effect of our lessons on our view of the world.<br />As many other reviewers have been quick to point out \\"The Prime of Miss Jean Brodie\\" is often the subject of university lectures and examinations. And there should be no surprise in that. This slim volume has a dazzling breadth of theme and expression composed almost singularly of one woman's personality.<br />\\"The Prime of Miss Jean Brodie\\" is probably the most beautifully visual of Muriel Spark's novels, containing some dazzling natural and urban imagery. These are lovingly interspersed in the otherwise sharp, and blackly comic text. It is easy to understand why Muriel Spark claims that her \\"novels are just an easier way of writing my poetry\\". <br />\\"The Prime\\" is also a comedy of some value (anyone who has seen the 1979 Maggie Smith film adaptation couldn't dispute it), and the childhood imaginings of Sandy and Jenny, two girls of the \\"set\\", certainly provides some laugh out loud moments. Like the classic imaginary love letter between Miss Brodie and her lover Mr. Lowther. Who could forget its wonderful conclusion - \\" Allow me, in conclusion, to congratulate you warmly upon your sexual intercourse, as well as your singing.\\"  The girls capture the eloquence and the ridiculousness of Miss Brodie beautifully andunknowingly. <br />The most compelling aspect of the novel, however, is its undeniably sinister streak. Miss Brodie is a \\"born Facist\\", as one of her set eventually comes to realise. She speaks with fervent passion of the \\"wonderous\\" regimes of Mussolini and Hitler, while encouraging one of her young charges to become involved in the Spanish Civil War. She does all this with a stunted self-aware romanticism and a deluded clarity that cuts directly to the coldest heart of her personality. Her teaching, which literally amounts to an indoctrination in the values of bigotry and prejudice, is instilled into her \\"set\\", some of whom do not escape as unscathed as the others. <br />To crown the glory is Spark's inventive narrative style, which feels free to skip and leap around the story of the rise and fall of Miss Brodie. The omnipresence of the author is always jabbing in another future event to permanently shape our view of the present. The holistic reading that emerges from this narrative assault allows for all kinds of realisations concerning identity, facism, illusion, truth and fiction. <br />A thoroughly terrifying, enjoyable read, for all those who don't quite believe that seeing/hearing is believing.
B00008G9JO|5.0|This is my favorite Tull. Far from \\"derivative\\", \\"unpleasant\\", or \\"embarrassing\\", this unique album shows subtle complexity and a deep interplay of moods and melody. I suppose if you think AQUALUNG was the be-all end-all of Tull (which is as subtle as a kick in the crotch), you might not appreciate this. The anger and cynicism that is so characteristic of Ian Anderson's lyrics on earlier albums is played down, probably mellowed from getting the heck out of the city and into the country for a couple of years. So what you don't have is a hard-edged sarcastic social critique. What you do have is a poignant reflection on a vanishing way of life and a fondness for country life. Anderson does affect a rustic twang in his vocals, but it fits the concept of the album. The compositions are strong, the melodies are sublime, the musicianship is some of the best Tull recorded. <br />This is story-book Tull. The majority of the songs are about farm animals; cats, dogs, mice, moths, and of course horses. They manage to conjure up the same playful, magical, feel of books like \\"The Wind in the Willows\\" and \\"Watership Down\\". Like I said, of you're an angry, self-serious sort, best stick with BENEFIT. However, if you can accept flights of fancy, delicacy, nostalgia, and beauty, pick this album up! It is one of the best albums of the 70's.
B00005R24K|5.0|EVIL DEAD    First all I can say is this is one of the greatest films ever made. All I can say is what in the [heck] was Sam Raimi thinking when he wrote this, if films were still written like this, classics would be in theaters all the time. It was a smart move for Raimi to direct this film because it put him right in the business. This film became an instant cult classic, the underground scene loved it. Of course you have to think right away of Bruce Campbell. This is the man that became famous because of this film; he did an excellent job in this film. I couldn't think of an EVIL DEAD without Bruce. The rest of the cast did great jobs to, Ellen SabdHal Delrich, Betsy Barker, and Sarah York. Of course we have to show some love to the crew working behind the scenes. But finally on to the movie.    This is the DVD edition so I will first go over the special features. The behind the scenes and outtake reels are great, but the best are the commentaries. Sam Raimi and Robert Tapert the producer give an insightful commentary track while Bruce's is hilarious. Now to the film, even though there are more special features. The movie has a group of friends going for a get away in the woods in an old cabin. Once there the friends stumble across the book of the dead, and a recording. They play the recording and awake the dead. The friends fall one by one becoming these creatures all in one night, and when day breaks.......     There is not enough time to go over how much I love this film it is absolutely one of my all time favorite films of all time. This is possibly part of the greatest series in the history of film; this group of friends that made these films are brilliant. All I have left to say is go buy not only this film but the next two in the series, EVIL DEAD 2 and ARMY OF DARKNESS.
B00008S2VF|5.0|What more can be said of this artist?  Madonna continues to evolve like no other performer.  She may be one lousy actress, but she keeps moving forward with recording.<br />In my opinion, this is her best since &quot;Bedtime Stories&quot; and is most like &quot;Like A Prayer&quot;.  <br />In fact, the worst song on the CD is the title track.  Songs like &quot;Nothing Fails&quot;, &quot;X-Static Process&quot; and &quot;Mother Father&quot; are reason enough to buy this CD.<br />This may not be Madonna's most commercially successful album, but it sure is her artistic best.<br />NOT to be missed!
055357342X|5.0|Excellent! Bold writing, twists and turns, characters full of emotion and life...and death!

While cleaning out an attic,the teens discover a pirates treasure map. the group ventures through nearby subterrarean caverns in search of the priceless jewels.Not a great script but plenty of thrills, some mild laughs along with a nice musical score.Cyndi Lauper sings the movie's theme song.good jobs especially by Sean Astin, Kerri Green and John Matuszak as Sloth.The DVD has some nice extras including cyndi laupers music video that runs 12 minutes.

B000000WZ4|5.0|haunting, experimental and morose but always tempered with hope, this is one of Depeche Mode's more underrated discs. The darkness of \\"Celebration\\" meets the power of \\"Violator\\"...simmer...stir...and serve. Gahan and Gore's catchy lyrics morph through blissfully warm synths for a seductive, introspective ride only \\"Mode\\" can provide. The aural equivalent of a warm blanket on a cold night!  \\"It's no good\\", \\"Home\\", \\"Freestate\\", \\"Sister of night\\", and \\"Insight\\" stand \\"slightly\\" above the rest of this quiet, moody masterpiece. This disc, coupled with Alan Wilder's departure,  caused divergence amongst it's fan base.  Many quietly hoping for another \\"Violator\\" type release were \\"put off\\" by Mode's new direction and sound.  The slower, more mature \\"Celebration\\" type atmosphere won't be to everyone's taste but the disc must be heard to be appreciated. As a fan of 15 years, i welcome ULTRA's return to the darker, more introspective sound which, to me, epitomizes Depeche Mode.
B000056N8X|5.0|Highlander endgame is a very good movie. actually it is my favorite movie. all the electricity flashing is really raw. i like the way the movie ended. The one that was killing all those immortals was a very smart person. And the one that killed an unarmed man should of killed the one guy when he had the chance because if he did he wouldnt have to die. i think it was stupid. honor or no honor he should of killed him.
B00008WG3U|5.0|simply put, The War on Errorism is one of the greatest Nofx releases ever.  this disc is up there with Punk in Drublic and The Decline, and the lyrics rival only that of The Decline's, and it is politically charged as well.  there is the usual progression, while still maintaining the classic Nofx sound.  despite the political songs, there are also a handful of humorous songs, and Anarchy Camp is in my opinion the best non-punk song they have ever written.  the album ends with &quot;Whoops, I OD'd,&quot; a catchy original song from one of the biggest innovators of punk music
0385507755|5.0|Beautifully written and very true if you've ever been addicted or known someone addicted.  Thank Goodness someone stepped up to show the ugliness and brutality of addiction - as well as to proclaim that addiction is a choice!   Many will disagree, but this society babies and victimizes addicts (keeping them addicted)by telling them they have a disease.  Doesn't mean giving up that addiction is easy by any stretch of the imagination; however, it is a choice.  In realizing that, one takes responsibility for one's actions!!!!  Finally, as Pat Conroy says (on back of book)  \\"And...the writing, the writing, the writing.\\"   Thank you James Frey.
B00005AXEL|4.0|I'm a recent inductee into Stevie Nicks, having being seduced, most disconcertingly, by the Corrs version of Fleetwood Mac's 'Dreams'. This album was my first Nicks purchase, having been convinced by its critical success and a Fleetwood Mac greatest hits albums that I'd bought(which introduced me to 'Rhiannon' and 'Sara').<BR>This album deserves its praise and even now two years after I purchased it I'm still discovering it as it were. 'Candlebright' is my current fave, but stand out tracks abound from the title cut, to the blistering 'Fall From Grace', as well as the Sherly Crowe penned 'It's only Love', which is possibly Nicks' finest vocal on the album. 'I Miss You' gains poignancy when one notices that buckingham played guitar on it and 'Love Is' becomes memorable when Sarah McLachlan's vocals kick in. <BR>'Too Far From Texas' doesn't do much for me 9but i ain't country) but overall not a filler in 'sight' and Nicks' middle aged voice conveys emotion, making it a fitting sequel to her 70s early 80s zenith.
B000002J0B|5.0|The best-of-the-best summer compilation you can find! It's May/2003 and it's amazing how tasteful this music is. Come on you rockers, you must play this on the road or the roadside---It's all aces. Buy this today or buy it again for the first time remastered!
B00005JM03|5.0|I went and saw this movie at the Minis Only world premier in Hollywood. I wouldn't call this movie a remake of the original though it does have a lot of scenes that are similar. The car chase scenes are pretty cool. There is also a few scenes with a classic Mini in it (for those who aren't big fans of the new MINI) If you like car movies, I'd say definitely go and see it. It is difficult to review it without giving anything away!
B00005JLRT|4.0|I avoided this movie at the theater due to poor reviews. Boy, we're they wrong! This film made me feel like I finally had the family back from the TV show. Although not without flaws, this is the best of the Next Gen movies.

B00005JLWN|5.0|Equilibrium is an awesome movie that goes with the idea in Fahrenheit 451, where books, art, and music are outlawed. Emotions in general are not allowed in this post World War 3 era, because the new government thought feelings created war and hostility towards others. The leading role is a cop named John Preston (Christian Bale), who is a cleric in the new government. What begins as routine &quot;feeling busting&quot; turns into life changing set of events that puts Preston on the wrong side of the law, but the right side of human nature. With awesome scenery, great fight scenes, matrix-like choreography, and a good story, this film is definately a must see. How it didn't get big in th cinema is beyond me. I give it 5 stars.
0385507755|2.0|I picked this book up because of all the hype it's received since release. As an individual acquainted with alcohol recovery, I'm interested in learning from the struggles others. The best memoirs on addiction and recovery (I think of Caroline Knapp's \\"Drinking a Love Story\\" and  Pete Hamill's \\"The Drinking Life\\") inspire the reader not only with tales of the courage involved in the addict's determination to embrace sobriety, but with the insight he/she gains in the process. Frey's book offers none of the kind of reflection a person needs to really come to terms with the cunning, baffling, and powerful nature of alcohol and drug addiction.  <BR>Further his writing style, which has garnered so much attention from the press, is simply a pared down prose with repetitive interjections meant to heighten whatever feelings he is having at the time. As a stylistic device it works only on occasion, for the most part it comes off as an extended whine. <BR>Finally, Frey's book is marketed as a memoir. As a reader I want to believe that I'm hearing a true account of his life, but certain incidents in the book make that impossible. His account of molestation by a priest is not only tough to buy; it strikes the reader as a cheap attempt to capitalize on the current scandal in the Catholic Church...<BR>This raises a critical issue with regard to the current interest in personal memoir; to what degree is the author responsible to write what really happened when dealing with his/her personal story? <BR>In Frey's book this question asserts itself prominently as it becomes apparent that the line between truth and fiction is as distorted as a teenager's sense of direction after a fifth of J.D.
0792160347|4.0|As would FLASHDANCE, AMERICAN GIGOLO helped to set the tone for the nascent 80's, though not to the extent that the former movie ultimately would.Nevertheless, as we watch, we see that emerging decade called the 80's unfold.  Clearly disco was on the way out and new wave was on the way in, as evidenced by the soundtrack and fashions of this film.  Also, you will see portents of the Miami Vice look that would become all the rage five years later.AG probably represented the last bastion of promiscuity and homosexual activity that flourished free of the threat of AIDS. The disease, if it did exist in that day in age, was probably so obscure that it wasn't even discussed even among those in the medical community.AG is the story of Julian Kaye, played by a painfully young-looking Richard Gere, a high-priced male prostitute who services the older, wealthier women of Beverly Hills.  Handsome, well-paid, sophisticated, and intelligent -- he is conversant in several languages -- he seems to live an enviable life of privilege and ease.He remains emotionally unattached to the women he comes in contact with until he catches the eye of a cool blonde named Michelle, played by Lauren Hutton.  She appears to be his equal in every way, but there is a cloud of mystery that surrounds her that Julian can't quite fathom.  They part, and he doesn't expect to see her again until she unexpectedly shows up at his apartment.  They spend the night together and come to the conclusion that they are in love.Julian discovers Michelle is the wife of a prominent Senator shortly after he's asked to fill in for a fellow prostitute's gig. The assignment is to pleasure the wife of a million-dollar businessman.  To Julian's horror, he reads of this woman's murder a few days later in the paper.  His pampered existence is tainted by this tragedy.  As his and Michelle's clandestine love flourishes, he realizes that he's being framed for a murder he didn't commit.  Who is doing this to him and why are reasons he can't figure out.  In vain he tries to obtain an alibi from friends and acquaintances, only to have them withhold help.  Then one is promised to him by Leon, a fellow prosititute, but he has his own reasons for vacillating which come to light later in the film.  Michelle wants desperately to help him, but she has everything to lose and absolutely nothing to gain by providing an alibi.The plot takes a few twists and turns as the film comes to its surprising conclusion, but one thing that's never made clear, or perhaps I wasn't paying attention, is where exactly Julian was on the night of the murder.  It's obvious that he's innocent, but where was he?  He may have spent all or part of that night with the wealthy woman who, along with her husband, repudiates him, but I'm still not sure.
B00006RU5B|1.0|First off let me say that I was a huge fan of Soundgarden and RATM. I followed this project from the beginning and I must admit I was very excited.<br />It was being advertised as being an album that captured the \\"Power of Rage Against The Machine\\" with the \\"Voice of Soundgarden.\\" I feel that Audioslave hasn't been able to achieve either of these elements.<br />The music is slow and plodding. It invokes images of a broken down vehicle being pushed through the mud. It goes nowhere.<br />Gone are the days of amazing and inventive guitar solos by Mr. Morello. The sound of this album is very formulaic and fits right in with what is 'cool' and 'hip' today. Two things that RATM certainly never concerned themselves with. And what's this? A ballad? Clearly, the power of RATM has been watered down and filtered to suit the broad tastes of people who like bands such as 3 Doors Down, Creed, Puddle of Mudd and Nickelback.<br />And now we come to the vocals. Please. When I heard Cornell was going to be singing I couldn't help but think of such amazing Soundgarden songs like \\"Rusty Cage,\\" \\"My Wave,\\" \\"Pretty Noose\\" and even \\"Black Hole Sun.\\" But you won't find anything like that on this album. His voice is raspy and tired and he is clearly past his prime. Many of the songs contain lyrics that are hard to hear because of his pronunciation. But don't worry kids, the cd booklet contains lyrics.<br />It's hard to imagine that this is the best they could do after 2 years.<br />So as I sit here listening to songs such as \\"Bulls On Parade\\" and \\"The Day I tried To Live\\" I can't help but wonder what could have been if the elements of songs such as these were to be put together - the right way.<br />It would have been amazing.
037542217X|5.0|If you're looking for action-packed suspense, you won't find it here. Like the rest of the series, this book offers a quiet charm that draws the reader into the lives of a small town in Botswana, Africa. Through the eyes of the heroine, Precious Ramotswe, we feel as though we, too, live in this village. The book as a realistic feel and the characters grow on me with each volume.<br />There's gentle suspense. This detective agency tracks down a lost family, to help a client repay a debt, and a straying husband, who turns out to be uncomfortably close to the agency.<br />Although Precious Ramotswe owns a detective agency,<br />she draws on common sense and her vast network, rather than special skills. Unlike Miss Marple, she doesn't go out of her way to find mysteries, or even label her puzzles as mysteries. She just enjoys life to the fullest.<br />Her fiance,Mr. Maketoni, provides a nice foil, with his motor repair agency, and we now meet two apprentices who have the potential to add additional flavor to the series.<br />Like M. C. Beaton, Smith writes small books that convey a sense of place with economy and skill.  However, his characters have a dignity that keeps the book charming rather than humorous. Smith is respectful, while Beaton takes a satiric twist every so often.<br />Stiill, of all mysteries I read, Beaton bears the closest resemblance. Fortunately for fans, both authors are prolific. With any luck, we'll see many more volumes in our lifetime.
B00006LI4S|5.0|I first saw this show on the BBC whilst in Scotland.  It came on at 1 am and despite being tired, I couldn't turn off the set.  Gilmour shows a different side of his musical self, and the performance shows a different side to the music he and Pink Floyd made famous.  Several songs migrate to minor chords, making them haunting and beautiful variations on familiar Floyd themes.  &quot;High Hope&quot; is masterful, and the show never lets down.  This performance will take any Floyd fan to places they haven't been before.  It's worth a look and a listen for sure.
B00005JL7Q|5.0|Hugh Grant plays a far more complex character than his usual charming British bachelors. Yes he is single again in this movie and yes he lives in London. And yes he is showing a \\"darker\\" side of himself as he did in \\"Bridget Jones\\" (which I loved).<BR>However, this movie is darker and deeper than his previous \\"famous\\" films (I have seen him in more serious fare from his younger days, but those films have been neglected by the mainstream.)<BR>\\"About a Boy\\" recounts the relationship between a lonely, misfit adolescent male and an isolated bachelor. There is humor-most of it delivered by Grant. And there is poignancy-particularly in the performance of Toni Colette, who plays the boy's suicidal, hippie mother. All of the performances are wonderful-Grant, the young boy, Toni Colette, Rachel Weisz-and the cast plays off each other beautifully. In addition, the story resembles real life and not your formulaic romantic comedy-Grant meets and dates one woman, who leads him to the boy and his mother, who eventually lead him to another woman that he dates-instead of just your standard boy meets just one girl at the beginning of the movie and ends up with her by the closing credits.<BR>I would recommend this movie for fans of comedy and of romance, though this isn't a romantic comedy. I also would recommend this movie for lovers of Nick Hornby's work, the author on whose book the movie was based. Of course if you're a Hugh Grant fan, you'll love it. If you don't like Hugh Grant-and I know many men a few women who loathe him-he is more palatable in this movie. But, of course, he is still Hugh Grant-and that's great for many people like myself, and unacceptable for others!<BR>One note on the dvd-the voice over commentary by the directors is insightful and interesting
B00000K413|5.0|There are a lot of people who write reviews of this disc because they are tears for fears fans. But I'm not. 'Head Over Heels' and 'Everybody Wants to Rule the World,' are the only songs after this album that even hint at the brilliance of this record for me.<br />The Hurting is great not just as a time capsule of the '80s - popular psychology's new wave musical moment. Each of these songs is an innovative pop wingding that showers the ears with perfect sound and exhilarating craftsmanship. I don't have the remastered version, but it would be a shame to tamper with these songs, because each of them (I have them on vinyl and on CD) is perfect just the way it is.<br />More than just a nostalgia piece for those who lived through the era (I heard many of the songs for the first time in 2000), this is one of the great overlooked pop records, sure to be canonized by loquacious music critics in the very near future.
0316666343|4.0|This book starts with an unusual and intersting premise: the narrator, a girl named Susie, has just been murdered. The reader will travel through the book, and the next few years, viewing Susie's family, town, friends and murderer through her dead eyes. <BR>I liked this book and I read it in one sitting. Sebold creates a memorable character in American fiction (though she doesn't rank as its greatest writer) with Susie. Susie is fun, somewhat popular, and intelligent. She shouldn't have had her life cut short and she really doesn't want to be in heaven. <BR>The best parts of the book for me detailed the impact of her death on her family. Susie aches to be with them. Each family member, in his or her way, aches to be with her. Each goes off in different directions with at times dire implications. I found these parts poignant and (given my knowledge of families who have lost a child) brutally realistic.<BR>My main problem with this book lies in the fact that several different writing styles seem to have been employed throughout it. I wondered if the author started and stopped at various times.<BR>I read \\"The Lovely Bones\\" for a book club of well educated suburban women. About 65%-myself included-liked the book. Another 35% didn't-either they couldn't handle the child's murder (they were mothers) or they felt the story meandered.<BR>I would recommend this book for most people (men and women) who enjoy contemporary fiction. However, if a child's rape and murder will bother you, I would not recommend it. For such readers, the writing isn't that great to justify the pain.
B000078DOI|5.0|Blood Sugar Sex Magik was a great album, and has been noted as so.  However, even though this album is shorter, I tend to find this one has more ingenuity and replay value.  The opener, \\"Good Time Boys,\\" sizzles, and has a truly cool intro (not to mention the awesome interlude where we hear snipits of totally unrelated songs right before firing back into the main riff.)  Next up is \\"Higher Ground,\\" their first big hit (despite being a cover.)  Short, but great.  Other highs are \\"Stone Cold Bush,\\" \\"Taste the Pain,\\" \\"Knock Me Down\\" and \\"Sexy Mexican Maid\\", but every song on here is cool enough for more than one listen.  Seriously, words can't describe how fresh and amazing this album is.  It's a must for anyone.  Buy it!!!  (Oh, and one quick note.  On this site's review, it noted that Frusciante's playing was especially great on \\"Fire.\\"  Well, even though he IS their best guitarist, THAT playing is actually from the late Hillel Slovak.  They had been playing that song quite a bit prior to Mother's Milk's release.)
0786868694|5.0|I confess: I am a Nigella groupie. I love her show, her books, her writing, and her overall take on life. She is an inspiration for forty-something women everywhere.<BR>Nigella Bites is an excellent book both for those individuals who already have her previous tomes and for those new to the Nigella world. She includes new recipes and she updates previous ones (her famous ham with coca cola, for instance). I particularly appreciated the revising of her recipes-you felt as if you were evolving with her. It forced me to rethink my own dishes and it made me realize that recipes are not set in stone. <BR>I have made a number of the recipes in this book including a lemon risotto for a casual cuisine club. All received good reviews. I would recommend that the cook watch the proportions of fat and calories in these recipes-Nigella lite can still be very good. <BR>Nigella is not for everyone. She is not a cooking purist-doesn't claim to be-and she is not into spa cuisine (to say the least). Her overall British goddess act could get on some people's nerves. But if you do like her, she is a wonderful, witty companion in your kitchen. Each new book launches another great series of conversations with her.
B000002LQR|5.0|Though I don't find this album quite as good as Mother's Milk, I still think this is a pretty incredible piece of work.  From the moment you put the CD in and are blown into the hip \\"Power of Equality,\\" you know you have some well-done work by the Chili Peppers.  Although some songs can tend to drag on, (mainly \\"Give It Away\\" and \\"Sir Psycho Sexy\\"), no material on here should be considered less than enjoyable.  It's a ride through raunchy, timeless funk (\\"Funky Monks\\", \\"Mellowship Slinky In B Major\\"), hip & aggressive rap beats (\\"Suck My Kiss,\\" the aforementioned \\"Give It Away,\\") & ballads that sound like they're coming straight from the heart (\\"Under The Bridge\\" & \\"I Could Have Lied\\", of which would prove to be a preview of the style of future Chili Peppers material.)  I recommend this to anyone; it's the album that would later prove to be (basically) their only decent material for a good eight years.
B00001W9G0|5.0|The Way We Were still makes me cry nearly 30 years after seeing it for the first time. The movie basically explores the cliche &quot;opposites attract&quot; as Golden Boy Hubble (Redford) and Communist Sympathizer Katie (Streisand) fall deeply in love and marry. But can their passion survive their differences? Ah, that's the story... The movie takes place in the 40's and 50's with beautiful sets and wonderful costumes.<BR>If you have never seen The Way We Were and you enjoy romance, melodrama, and/or historical drama, then you should buy or rent it. (The weepiness may make this a tough sell for some men and women who dislike this genre.) If you have seen The Way We Were, then you should still rent or buy the DVD. The extra features are outstanding. Sydney Pollack's (the director) commentary is insightful and informative. He talks about everything from camera angles to Redford's hesitance about doing the part. The documentary is also beautiful and a &quot;must see&quot; for The Way We Were groupies.
0679745203|3.0|The English Patient by Michael Ondaatje. Recommended.<br />In this poetic novel by poet Michael Ondaatje, the author explores the past and present (the closing days of World War II) lives of young Canadian nurse Hana, her English patient, her family friend and accomplished thief David Caravaggio, and Indian sapper Kirpal Singh (nicknamed Kip).<br />Hana, who has lost her father and her lover during the war, has been desensitised and traumatised-only 19, she has held cigarettes to the lips of armless boys and moved patients only to find that they are already being consumed by worms. When the Italian villa-turned-hospital where she works is abandoned toward the end of the conflict, she insists on remaining behind with the one patient who cannot be moved-an enigmatic English patient whose skin is burned black from a plane crash in North Africa and who does not seem to remember who he is. The only clue he carries is The Histories of Herodotus, which he uses as a commonplace book.<br />Caravaggio, thief turned intelligence agent, has lost the practical use of his hands when he is caught stealing by the Italians and loses his thumbs as a physically and emotionally brutal punishment. A morphine addict, Caravaggio cannot rest until he knows all the secrets-those of Hana's heart but especially those of the mysterious Englishman.<br />Like the others, Kip belongs nowhere to no one. Estranged from his family by his nontraditional beliefs and pursuits, he is also a man without a country-an Indian sapper in an English army that does not welcome foreigners, especially Indians. A loner by nature and by circumstances, Kip finds respite if not meaning in Hana's arms.<br />For a professed amnesiac, the English patient remembers great detail, from his post-accident discovery in the desert by Bedouins and their subsequent treatment of his injuries to his earlier life as a member of a 1930s group of explorers seeking to answer such riddles as how Cambyses and his army could attempt to cross a desert-unless there were a Zerzura to be found. Of equal or greater importance to his exploration reminiscences are his memories of his hot affair with a fellow explorer's wife that burns itself out in tragedy.<br />The long passages in which the English patient slowly unravels (but never admits to) the mystery of his identity and past are intriguing, spellbinding, revealing, and poetic. Those with any curiosity will find themselves wanting to read more about not only 1930s European expeditions into the desert, but about the desert itself-where dozens of different types of winds inspire the Bedouins to don them with dozens of beautiful names descriptive of their moods.<br />On the other hand, Caravaggio, who feels safest revealing nothing, pieces together his own knowledge with the clues dropped by the English patient to come up with a plausible theory about his identity, actions, and movements during the war-but not his motivations. Even as his name and his past are gradually unveiled, his character remains elusive-perhaps explaining why Hana is in love with the living remains of a dead man.<br />Hana and Kip, and their relationship, are the least interesting elements of the novel. Hana's character functions as the center around which the others meet. As a sapper, Kip's duty of disarming bombs becomes virtually his sole focus in life. When he learns of the ultimate bomb, the ultimate weapon that even he cannot disarm, and who it is used against, he in his ignorance confronts the English patient-a moment of irony. The villa, an island surrounded by a sea of turmoil and change, is not so remote that the \\"death of civilisation\\" cannot reach it.<br />The best of The English Patient reminded me at times of Mark Helprin (Winter's Tale, A Soldier of the Great War) in tone and evocations. While not a great novel, it is certainly an interesting, thought-provoking, and worthwhile diversion.<br />Diane L. Schirf, 21 May 2003.ross a desert-unless there were a Zerzura to be found.

0385503954|5.0|This book chilled me. The premise-a 13-year old girl tells a lie that ruins lives-snares the reader early on. Can someone make such a profound mistake at such a young age and never be able to seek atonement for the rest of one's life? McEwen explores this thought throughout the book. <BR>The writing is beautiful, at times lyrical. The settings-an odd English country home, London during WW II, Dunkirk, the home again-have been visited before and we will be visited again in numerous tomes. However, McEwen casts a fresh eye on these locales and these times. The War almost comes as a relief to these individuals, a new focus for their energies previously consumed or destroyed by the lie. <BR>The ending provokes thought. The author leaves the reader with a challenge: what is reality in fiction and what is not? <BR>I would recommend this book for those individuals who like to have new thoughts thrown at them. At times, the story gets a bit slow (hence the 4.6 on a scale of a 1 to 5), and if you are seeking fast paced action, then you might have trouble with this book. But it is well worth the time and the energy. Once you finish it, you will want to discuss with someone else.
B0000797IO|4.0|The Good Girl offers Jennifer Aniston a chance to play against type and she shows she can play a character that is the 180-degree turn from her role as Rachel on Friends.  Ms. Aniston stars as Justine Last, a thirty-year old woman who is caught in a dead-end job at a store called Retail Rodeo and in a stagnant marriage to Phil (John C. Reilly).  Phil is a shiftless slob who is constantly sitting in front of the television smoking dope with his painting co-worker, Bubba (Tim Blake Nelson).  At work Justine starts falling for a troubled new cashier, Holden (Jake Gyllenhaal).  Holden is a twenty-two year old college dropout and has a troubled life of his own.  His real name is Tom, but he adopted the name Holden from Catcher In The Rye and he wants to be a writer.  Just like Holden Caufield, Tom has psychiatric problems, but he makes Justine feel alive again and they enter into a [love] affair.  Justine is torn between her love for Holden and the guilt she feels for having an adulterous relationship.  Justine and Phil are trying to have kids, but have been unsuccessful and in one very humorous scene at fertility clinic, Phil asks Justine to help him in providing the clinic with a sample.  Justine does become pregnant, but the movie leaves it uncertain to who is the father.  One is lead to believe its Holden, because the fertility clinic tells Phil that his sperm is no good, but they never divulge the secret.  At the end of the film, Holden robs the Retail Rodeo of about $20,000.  He asks Justine to run away with him and Justine must decide whether she goes with Holden or stays with Phil.  The film is a dark and somewhat depressing tale, but is tempered nicely with comic relief, most notably provided by Zooey Deschanel as Cheryl, an acerbic co-worker of Justines at the Retail Rodeo.  She starts the film off as the P.A. announcer in the store and her bizarre and hilarious announcements on store specials are priceless and she has the habit of slipping the most inappropriate words into her sales pitches to customers at the cosmetic counter where she applies the most garish makeup looks to be both herself and customers.  John Carroll Lynch is an underrated character actor and he gives yet another strong and under appreciated performance as Retail Rodeos store manager.  Director Miquel Arteta creates a perfect visual landscape for the film.  The dusty and windy setting of the nameless Texas town where the story takes place fits the despair of the film and screenwriter Mike White adds all the right touches to the script as well as acting as a security guard at Retail Rodeo who is a religious zealot.  In the end, this film relies on Ms. Anistons performance.  The film tries to make her look unglamorous and douty and that doesnt quite work, but she gives a very strong performance and is worthy of the praise she received for the role.  I wouldnt go so far to say it was Oscar worthy, but it is by far the best acting job she has done outside of her brilliant work on Friends and it was definitely among the ten or fifteen performances from an actress in 2002propriate words into her sales pitches to customers at the cosmetic counter where she applies the most garish makeup looks to be both herself and customers.

6305922756|5.0|I loved this movie when I first saw it twenty years ago. I have seen it a number of times since then and I have laughed so hard every time. The story of a sixties &quot;flower power&quot; band turned heavy metal in the eighties still holds its own in the 00's. The performances by the stars-you really believe that they are these singers-are classics. Plus you get to see a young Fran Drescher (pre Nanny) and Billy Crystal (pre When Harry Met Sally) in small but very funny parts. <BR>The DVD improves this movie. The voice over commentary of the band members-in character-is every bit as funny as the movie itself. They never stop talking and making you laugh. Even if you own the vhs, you still should get the dvd. It's that funny.
B00005JLEU|5.0|Hayao Miyazaki brings us this wonderful story about a young girl named Chihiro who enters a magical world where the spirits reside.  She starts out as a whining selfish child but buy the finnish she is completly transformed into a polite, compasionate young woman.  The art is beaautiful and detailed, the sceanery is bright and lively, and the multiple deep threaded messages are meaningful and easy to see.  The musical scores are perfectly fitted to the film and the entire experiance is wonderful.<br />There is only one thing left to say,<BR>     Thank you Miyazaki-son
B00008NRI8|4.0|If I were writing a review of this movie, I would only have given it three stars. It's cute, somewhat though not too funny, with some chemistry between Sandra Bullock and Hugh Grant. It has all the ingredients of your standard romance comedy: a New York city backdrop, a wealthy bachelor, a scheming rival, a heroine with a heart of gold. If you like romantic comedy, you'll like this for the most part. If you're lukewarm or dislike romantic comedy, you'll hate this movie. <BR>HOWEVER, the DVD vastly improves the movie. The voice over with Sandra Bullock and Hugh Grant is very, very funny-much funnier than the movie itself. You want to see another movie with the two of them after you hear their repartee.
B000002BFL|5.0|I'll start by saying that this is my first and most likely only review I have or will write on Amazon. I feel compelled to write because The Ghost of Tom Joad is an album that haunts me daily.<br />As a fan of Bruce from a time before I really understood the true meanings behind many of his songs, he has been one of the artist that has written the soundtrack of my life. As I grew older my mind opened and I began to hear the sadness and longing of many of the characters in his songs. However most of those characters had a distinct hope that life could be better.<br />Hope is something that escapes many of the characters on The Ghost of Tom Joad. Their daily lives have led to them to a point of deperation or longing that many of us can't understand. But for those that would say this album is devoid of hope, I would suggest that an artist need not have his characters voice their hope for a better life for that hope to exist.<br />This album is honestly in my top ten favorite albums of all time. It never fails to make me think about the condition of life throughout the world. My only complaint is that the tracks on the album should have been arranged so that the album ended with the beautifully hopefull song, \\"Across the Border.\\" That song encapsulates the true essence of hope.<br />Buy this album and treat it as a beautiful novel set to music.
B00005JKZV|2.0|Don't be fooled. Apart from the most basic elements of the book's storyline, Peter Jackson's version is very different. Characterizations, dialogue, secondary plots, locations; nothing has been spared the poisoned razor of the Jackson crew. While it may be a 'big' film (in that it cost a lot of money and has been widely hyped), it is a real disappointment in terms of what it could have delivered. The changes in The Two Towers are so significant, an extended edition will only further the bizarre and shallow changes that were made. As for the people that claim that they understand why P. Jackson made the changes, perhaps you could explain it to the people that don't. This isn't Tolkien's Middle-earth. It's Jackson's, and it should be stated as such. I'm waiting for a version that pays homage to the beauty of the book's original dialogue (among many other things), and not a film rife with modern Americanisms ('let's hunt some orc!' Argh!) Strangely, the Ralph Bakshi animated version is truer to the orginal story than this soul-less blockbuster.

Anyone who has seen or heard boots from the 77' Tour knows what I'm talking about.  <br />Looking forward to seeing the 75' Earl's Court performances which have some incredible moments. I imagine the 79' shows will have the best video coverage since they were pro-shot. The shows never stood out as being that great in my opinion.<br />I'm sure I'll still watch this DVD a million times.
B000002UB3|5.0|PLEASE READ THIS! Abbey Road is simply the greatest album by the greatest band of all time. There is no way to debate the fact that Abbey Road not only continued the Beatles' revolutionizing of rick but also wrapped up the amazing band's career. There is not one song on this CD that I skip while listening to it. If you want to start a Beatles collection....heck, if you want to start any CD collection, buy this. You will simply taken aback by the genious works of four British guys. The more known tracks such as &quot;Come Together&quot; and &quot;Maxwell's Silver Hammer&quot; are decent but unknown tracks like &quot;Because&quot;, &quot;Mean Mr. Mustard&quot;, and &quot;She Came in Through the Bathroom Window&quot; are simply unbelievable. BUY THIS NOW!
B00005JLRT|4.0|Captian Picard didn't seem to be himself at all, and there's a few hard strives for comedy within the first twenty minutes. The set-up bothers me also though... Why would they want to piece B-4 back together AND give him all of Data's memories after how Lore turned out? I can tell you why, because that's the only way they could kill Data (Yes, Data dies *cries*) at the end and still have his legacy live on in some way. <br />Shinzon and his legion of Remans are obviously inspired by classic vampire literature (Shinzon gave off a distinct Dracula vibe in many of the scenes he was in). No really, look! Shinzon needs Picard's blood to live and he and his ilk are not fond of the light (not to mention a few smaller things that you'd have to see to figure out). I also received the distinct impression of a Weegie Board when Diana was probing the Viceroy's mind for the Scimitar's location. <br />None of this really made Nemesis a bad movie, although I was afraid it was going to be for the first thirty minutes or so. It does have a pretty interesting plot, along with some truly brilliant moments. But with the death of Data and the loss of Ryker and Diana, I fear we are coming to the end of Next Generation.... Perhaps they'll see fit to do a few Voyager movies now, just please, PLEASE NO ENTERPRISE MOVIES!
B00008H2LB|3.0|As much as I've been defending the LP boys to my rock-purist friends, Meteora gave me little to work with. Like barely half an hour. I'm sorry, guys, I'd much rather you double the length of the music on the CD so I don't have to change it twice while I'm driving to get groceries...I'll take it over a neato DVD bonus any day. If you liked Hybrid Theory (which I did) then you will like Meteora. I'm just disappointed that I only LIKED it after giving these guys so much time since their first album (Reanimation notwithstanding) to come up with something original and better. Overall, this album IS good, and worthy of checking out, ..., you see that it's practically the other half of what most other bands would consider a full length album. I've paid [less] for EPs just as long as this.
B00005QGAZ|5.0|I normally listen to new age music but occasionally I will buy a few rock albums. Thriller came out way back sometime around 1980, I wasn't even born yet! But I'm so glad that I was still able to get a copy of it.<br />  All in all, every song on the album is excellent but I will only mension a few.\\"Wanna Be Startin Somethin\\" has a great beat and is mostly the only one on the album that has that dance beat to it.\\"The Girl is Mine\\" features some parts by Paul McCartney, I don't really listen to the beatles but I must admit that he has a great voice.\\"Thriller\\" is another great one and on here and it features a rap part done by Vincent Price.\\"Beat It\\" also has loud parts in it and this one is one of my favorites. One of the soft ones on here is\\"Human Nature\\" and it also has great lyrics.<br />  This version of Thriller includes interviews with Quincy Jones and Rod Temperton where they discuss the making of Thriller. There also is a voice over session with Michael Jackson and Vincent Price where Vincent Prices reads the rap part of the song\\"Thriller\\" including the never before heard second verse. It also features the new songs\\"Someone in the Dark\\",\\"Billie Jean\\"[Michael Jackson's original demo recording] and\\"Carousel\\".<br />  Michael Jackson has created a wonderful album and maybe I might get another CD by him. I would strongly recommend this to almost any rock fan out there and if you buy it I hope you enjoy it. That's all I have to say and I hope my review was helpful to you.<br />    Good-Bye!
B00005JKCH|4.0|This was a VERY faithful adaptation of a comic book to the big screen, with a few tuneups for today's generation (the original was written going on forty years ago). That being said, it's great, it's fun, it's positive for younger and older viewers without being TOO campy. It IS a comic book. If you're expecting realism, you're not being realistic enough to consider the source. Plenty of bonus goodies with a wealth of background for all the special features fanatics. No superficial pointless plot twists, no heavy handed preachy message (although the morality lesson conveyed IS valid and tactfully done without too much browbeating), and even the sexual tension is RELATIVELY innocent for the target age group. Would it win Academy awards? Not really. Should it? Not especially. Have fun with it; that's what practically every Sam Raimi film is designed for.
0448060191|5.0|I read Little Women when I was a young girl, and now I am a grandma, but I must say, this wonderful book for young girls is a must read. Its story of family love, loyalty, fun, daily life experiences, and sacrifice in difficult times is an inspiration to all readers. It is one of my favorite youthful reading memories!...
0385507755|1.0|After finishing this book last night and feeling totally underwhelmed, I was curious to read what others are saying about it on Amazon.  After perusing the customer reviews, it's clear that the majority of readers are having the same reaction to the book as I had.  Why is this book receiving such praise?  The writing itself is workmanlike and stilted.  There is not one sentence I read that captured my imagination or impressed me.  If we are speaking soley about skill, Frey seems to be lacking \\"chops.\\"  Indeed, it seems he's relying on formatting rather than the art of words to make his book special.  Frankly, if you have to resort to wacky formatting, it might be a sign that you need a crutch.  It certainly didn't enhance the reading experience or seem to have much of a purpose.  Instead, it constantly took me out of  the story.  I wonder if the prose was forced to stand on its own the book would be receiving such unrestrained accolades.  Furthermore, there is the issue of plot.  I understand this is supposed to be a \\"true\\" story, but if it is, then Frey was living in the land of shopworn cliches: the hooker with the heart of gold, the loveable mobster who takes Frey under his wing, the DRAMATIC confrontation with a glass of liquor at the end.  If this book were a work of fiction, would critics note these banalities?  Overall, I would say this is a poorly written book with a predictable and tedious story and characters who seem lifted from a bad Hollywood movie about addicts.  Before reading this book, I read DRY by Augusten Burroughs.  If you want to read an original, funny and genuinely moving book about time in rehab, I would suggest you pass by A MILLION LITTLE PIECES and check out DRY.
B000089RVX|5.0|I first heard the song Bring Me To Life in various places, at hockey games, on the radio, etc., and it always stuck with me. Once I found out who it was and read some of the other reviews on amazon.com, I knew I had to find out more. I ended up purchasing the album and am still in shock by the wonderful songs I heard.<br />Here's the rundown:<br />Going Under...5/5: This is a power ballad if I've ever heard one and is a great high-impact start to the album.<br />Bring Me To Life...4.5/5: A great song that's been slightly overplayed on the radio (at least in my neck of the woods), but is just great all the same.<br />Everybody's Fool...4/5: An eerie start to song get's everything set up for the third straight winner on the record. It's a fantastic track about, well, everybody's fool.<br />My Immortal...5/5: This is one of two piano-only songs on the album. Amy Lee displays her angelic voice in this one that will send chills down your spine.<br />Haunted...4/5: Here's another song that will send chills down your spine, but for different reasons. As the title may suggest, the song seems haunted and will make you feel that way. Backed by the Millenium Choir from Los Angeles, there's almost no need for the haunting music, the great voices accomplish that effect very well.<br />Tourniquet...3.5/5: One of the edgier songs of the release, \\"Tourniquet\\" cries out from the bottom of someone's soul.<br />Imaginary...4.5/5: One of three songs written by Evanescence's creators, Lee and Ben Moody, \\"Imaginary\\" takes you through a very serene and bizarro world.<br />Taking Over Me...4/5: This song is along the same lines as the opening track, \\"Going Under\\". Wether or not is has anything to do with the same thing is up for debate, but it certainly sounds like it. It also includes the hard, driving guitar of Moody.<br />Hello...4/5: \\"Hello\\" is the other piano-only song of the album, taking you through the world of someone who seems to be on their last leg.<br />My Last Breath...3.5/5:Speaking of last's, \\"My Last Breath\\" is another one of those hard-driving ballads, lead by the breathtaking vocals of Ms. Lee.<br />Whisper...4.5/5: The closing track of this stellar album is a great finish. The end of the song has an indescribable chorus by the Millenium Choir that wrars up the fantastic record.
B00005JLT5|5.0|The saying goes that \\"A picture is worth a thousand words\\"...if that is the case, than this film is worth millions of them.  <br />Very few films have the ability to make the viewer cry, feel pain, or joy.  This one will take you through them all.  At the close of this film you will feel as though you have lived through everything that Szpilman lived through, as well as those who were not so fortunate.  You will feel weary at the end...you will feel like you have triumphed over something.  You will feel a duty to live your life to the fullest and to allow others to live their lives as well.  You will learn a lesson that we all should learn.  The human spirit cannot be broken so long as there is something it can hope for.  <br />Brody is exquisite as Szpilman, taking on the burden forced on the musician by the oppressing Nazi invaders.  You can look in his eyes and see the pain that Szpilman must have felt.  You can also see his strength.<br />You will not regret seeing this film.<br />It's simply not possible.
B00008WG3U|4.0|I think this is the best album from these guys, I new Nofx were there, but i never really took a liking to there old stuff. But this album appealed to me.I heard &quot;Franco Un-american&quot;for the first time and i loved it straight away. nice catchy tune with some great potlical lyrics. On this cd they got a couple of wack catchy tunes like &quot;Shes Nubs&quot;(classic)&quot;Anarchy Camp&quot;. But overall there are great punk beats specially &quot;the separation of chruch and skate&quot; &quot;Mattersville&quot; (read the lyrics there great)<BR>&quot;13 Stitches&quot; , but the best song on this cd is &quot;re-gaining unconsciousness&quot;.Nofx have been around for a while and i think are getting better same with lagwagon there new cd &quot;blaze&quot; is a great punk cd.
B00006BTCA|5.0|Interpol has easily turned out one of the best discs of 2002 if not the best.  As debut's go you will be hard pressed to find a better one.  From beginning till end it safe to say there isn't a weak track, although I admit the album does have to be listened to a couple of times to see that.  Sure it isn't an album that has classic written all over it like the Stone Roses debut or Unknown Pleasures, but in time I think people will come to see how good it actually is.  The question is now whether they ever will be able to top it.  That has yet to be seen, but as of right now it is safe to say this is something special, even if it isn't entirely original but what really is?  Almost any band you ever really hear you can tell they sound like someone, how well they can disguise it is all that matters and they disguise it very well I think.  Enjoy this record people, not many like this come along.
B00005JLRT|3.0|The plot of \\"Star Trek: Nemesis\\" comes down to three situations. First, and most importantly, Captain Picard (Patrick Stewart) discovers that he not only has a clone (Tom Hardy) who was created by the Romulans by raised by the Remuseans, but that the enterprising Shinzon has become Praetor of the Romulan Empire, which has a weapon that can destroy all life on Earth. Second, in an obvious parallel, Data (Brent Spiner) discovers yet another of Dr. Soong's prototype androids, named B-4 (also Spiner). Third, and finally in more ways than one, Commander Riker (Jonathan Frakes) and Counselor Troi (Marina Sirtis) are finally getting married. This 10th Star Trek film, and four in the STNG part of the series, has its moments but is ultimately less than satisfying.<br />Part of the problem is that even before the film's climatic death scene we are already aware that we have another Star Trek death that is not really death scene. Yes, this is certainly more plausible than the first one in \\"Star Trek II: The Wrath of Khan\\"/\\"Star Trek III: The Search for Spock,\\" but that it is at the expense of the shock and emotional impact the first time around. Consequently, the big payoff rings hollow, which is never a good sing for a major theatrical release.<br />Another part of the problem is that the cast is so large that few of them have much of value to do. Geordi LaForge (LeVar Burton) has been standing by for several films mainly to ask Data what he is doing so the android can explain, Beverly Crusher (Gates McFadden) waits for casualties to show up in sick bay, and Worf (Michael Dorn) is at least good for a few laughs with the comments he makes in his cups while everyone is toasting Riker and Troi. As far as the movies go, STNG has boiled down to Picard and Data, and the rest are along for the ride, posing stiffly and formly in the background. That being said, \\"Nemesis\\" finally gives Counselor Troi the main supporting role and a couple of scenes when she proves she can give as well as receive. But overall there are two many cast members sitting around with little or nothing to do; compare this with the series finale \\"All Good Things...\\"<br />Finally, there are just too many significant gaps in the thinking of the main characters. Picard and his clone think they understand each other as if in the future the nature versus nurture issue has gone the way of safety belts being required on alll chairs on spaceships. Yes, having a clone is creeping. Yes, having your clone serving in a Romulan slave pit is disturbing. But the idea that the result is a younger version of itself was never legitimated by novels/films like \\"The Boys From Brazil.\\" This is supposed to be the future, but the \\"science\\" here is about on par with a 1950s film. If I, who know virtually nothing about science in general or cloning in particular can see the holes in this logic, than Picard's Starfleet Academy training should serve him in much better stead.<br />Now that we are apparently here at the end of the road for \\"Star Trek: The Next Generation\\" it might be appropriate to conduct a post mortem and consider the question of why the theatrical films were never as good as any of the two-part episodes of the television series. The short explanation is they went for bigger (e.g., the Borg rewrite human history) rather than better. What is so puzzling is why a creative staff that came up with several solid story lines almost every season for many years could not cut it when it was required to come up with one very good idea every few years. \\"Star Trek - Nemesis\\" has the characters of STNG but neither the style nor the substance; what does Picard driving a intergalactic dune buggy have to do with why we loved this television show? Plus, the lighting makes Data's skin look really weird. At least we have the original STNG out on DVD now.as receive.

0812548094|4.0|This book is action packed and kept me on the edge of my seat from beginning to end.  Were it not for the Mord Sith scene being way too long and sappy, I would have given it 5 stars.
B000002C1V|4.0|This album is not as instantly popular as The Wall - but in terms of so many sounds and effects - it is The Wall's last segment.  I personally really enjoyed many songs - especially Southhampton Dock.  This album is a creeper - the more you listen to it and what's going on in it - the more you appreciate it.
B00003CXXM|5.0|I've seen some reviews say this film is based very loosely on the book by Robert Ludlum. Having never read the book, I started off with a clean slate...and MAN I LOVED IT.<br />This film is action packed from the get-go. There are a few setup scenes, but the film keeps you on the edge of your seat.<br />The film follows Matt Damon's character, Jason Bourne. He awakens floating in the Mediterannean with no recollection of his identity, as well as a couple of bullets in his back. He spends the film trying to find his identity, as well as the identity of those who keep trying to kill him.<br />I've never been a fan of Matt Damon's, but this film may be the one that win's me over to his side. I found his acting to be quite good.<br />The special edition DVD contains a few extras, including an alternate ending, which I haven't watched. I don't want to ruin it for myself. This movie is certainly not for children, as it contains copious amounts of violence, and some sexual content.<br />If you like action films, or even suspense, this movie is for you. If you like Matt Damon, ditto. If you like knitting, and peace and quiet, don't get it. Otherwise, add this one to your collection.
0385504209|5.0|Dan Brown has written an erudite, funny, and hugely entertaining fable about the history of Jesus, the Bible, the Roman Catholic Church, and those who study them.  I suspect that the only readers who won't like &quot;The Da Vince Code&quot; will be those Christians so committed that they cannot see the fun in playing a fictionalized historical &quot;What If?&quot; game with the life of Jesus or those who are unwilling to suspend disbelief sufficiently to accept a wildly entertaining but preposterous tale.  Trust me, the plot of this book has more to do with the Brothers Grimm than it does with provable historical fact.  No matter, this is a tremendously satisfying read.  5 stars out of 5.
B00005JMFR|5.0|simalar to star wars epIII this is where everything happens. The war will finally end. Neo (now that we know that he has power inside the matrix) will be truley the one and invincable after coming out of his coma. agent smith will be destroyed forever, as will the pretty kool twin virus and there creator. the maker of the matrix (he was in bill and ted,the old guy with the beard) will probably be in it again aswell. Trinity will do some more kool stuff as will morpheius and Zion will be saved from the machines. The Matrix was Excellent, Reloaded was also excellent, this promises to be outstanding.
B0000033PB|3.0|Emerson, Lake and Palmer was the first Progressive Rock supergroup, but the glory days are over and the magic is gone when they released this 1992 album, their first studio effort in a dozen years.  It is not a question of their technical proficiency, because Keith Emerson remains my favorite keyboard artist and is in fine form, as he shows on \\"Changing States\\" and the piano solo on \\"Close to Home\\" (this was a few years before hand surgery affected his playing ability).  However, from the start of this album with the title song and \\"Paper Blood\\" it is clear that these are much simpler songs than we recall from the past, with few bursts of the wonderful complexity for which ELP was rightly known.  For me there is also the concern over the aging of Greg Lake's voice, which is really unrecognizable.  In the days of my youth that was the voice that I most wanted to have (e.g., the live version of \\"Lucky Man\\" on \\"Welcome Back My Friends\\"); but instead of my voice becoming more like his it is the other way around, which is not a good thing.  That is an admittedly personal problem, but on the professional level Lake is doing less of the songwriting than before and the best track on the album is the adaptation of the classical piece &quot;The Dance of the Knights&quot; from Prokofiev's Romeo and Juliet.  \\"Footprints in the Snow\\" is a minor Lake composition at best, which is another disappointment.  ELP was one of my favorite all-time groups, and hearing them play lesser songs without the fire that made them famous, is just another sign that we are all growing old.
B00005YW4H|3.0|After Jones walked away with 8 grammy awards and critics raves dominating the music rags, I thought I should buy this cd.  I do like Come Away With Me and hence thought I'd like the cd.  I was disappointed.  Some of the reviews mentioned that she played in so many different styles but in fact, there is only one timbre, one tone to this whole album.  If you don't pay attention while the disc is playing you might think it is one long song.  It also just sounds too much like she was overly influenced by Billie Holliday.  Billie was Billie.  If I want to listen to her style I'll listen to her or to someone like Miki Howard paying tribute to Billie Holliday.  Norah only had her hand in writing three of the songs on this disc, that doesn't make her prolific and since I didn't think she added anything new to classics such as \\"The Nearness of You\\" I didnt' think it was worth listening to yet another recording of the song.
B000070IXT|5.0|First off 4 stars for the movie, and throw in the 5th for it being in super bit!!  I love the super bit concept!  The movie with highest bit rate possible for the best picture!  Screw multible languages, and boring makeing of featurets, and DTS sound, Ionly need either DTS or Dolby Digital not both.  Anyway good Zombie flick from a game, looks and sounds fantastic...
0783225733|5.0|This is one of those movies that really makes you think. The events in the film (for the most part) are as they actually happened. <br />This film follows the crew of the Apollo 13 lunar mission, when something goes terribly wrong with the spacecraft, threatening the mission, as well as the crew's lives.<br />The actors in the film do an excellent job, and with good reason. Many of them have been nominated for oscars, and some of them have won. Tom Hanks and Kevin Bacon are just two of the high quality actors in this film.  Ed Harris and Gary Sinise play supporting roles, but do it flawlessly. The acting is so good, that parts of the film make you feel as though you are there in the capsule with these men.<br />This was the first DVD I bought after getting my DVD player, and saw how crisp and clear the picture was. I was a bit fooled by this, as a lot of DVDs aren't this good. The picture and sound are crystal clear.<br />I recommend this movie to everyone with a DVD player. It is acceptable for children, and might even teach them a thing or two about the history of manned spaceflight.
B00008PW3Q|5.0|Too many people have misjudged this record by summing up their evaluations after a preliminary listen.  With a jaw-dropping 18 song track list, this album needs to be played a few times before one can appreciate its brilliance.  I, too was lukewarm when I first heard the album.  Having had it for over a month, I can honestly say that it is one of the best Fleetwood Mac albums ever, second only to Rumours.  I find myself wanting to listen to it every day, it's that good.  Every song is a standout as if the album was a collection of greatest hits.  Equally amazing is the excellent musicianship is in the band after all these years. Both Stevie and Lindsey are in fine form, vocally and musically and have written some of their best material ever. This is Fleetwood Mac's Supernatural and should go on to multi-platinum success.  I'm willing to bet that this album will win big at next year's Grammy and American Music Awards.<br />With so many great songs, it's hard to pick favorites.  However, Peacemaker, Say You Will, Murrow Turning in his Grave, Say Goodbye, Thrown Down, Flowers in the Garden come to mind.  Peacemaker benefits from Stevie's gorgeous background alongside Lindsey's.  A beautiful melody, it should be higher in the charts.  An appropriate choice as the lead-off single given the tie-in to modern times and also because it's catchy and positively proclaims the Mac is back.  The title track promises to be a big hit, especially in the crossover and country charts.  This is the song that will draw audiences to Fleetwood Mac.<br />Of the two albums I was looking forward to, the other being Madonna's, I can honestly state that this is the better record.  The harmonies and slick production are perfectly in sync with the mood and tempo of the songs.  This album proves that FM is not content to ride on the coattails of their past glory.  Though some songs have a characteristic FM sound, many others explore new areas, partcularly Lindey's Murrow and Come.  <br />I own both the Special Edition and the DVD-Audio.  The DVD-Audio is worth getting for improved clarity of the stereo mix but I found the 5.1 Dolby Digital performance to be lacking.  The mix is bright and lacking in bass.  I don't have a DVD-Audio player so I can't comment on the DVD Audio performance.  The other misgiving I have is with the menus on the DVD Audio disc which don't allow you to pause or fast forward.  However, the stereo performance more than makes up for the deficiencies.  All in all, an awesome album and highly recommended in any format.  I'll conclude with a listing of my top 5 FM albums::<br />1 Rumours<BR>2 Say You Will<BR>3 Tango in the Night<BR>4 Tusk<BR>5 Fleetwood Mac
B00005JKZV|5.0|Peter Jackson's second of three film versions of the Lord of the Rings Trilogy is superb in many ways. As an adaptation of the book, \\"The Lord of the Rings: The Two Towers\\" this is as authentic as a film can get. Like its predecessor, \\"The Lord of the Rings: The Fellowship of the Rings\\", this film blends the perfect degree of realism and fantasy so that the viewer is comfortably ensconced between the two. Like the Middle Earth of the books, the one in this film is believable, yet clearly an imaginary world.<br />The film picks up where its predecessor left off. The dark lord of a powerful evil empire launches multiple wars of aggression. In the process of doing this, he abrogates all the treaties that preserve the peace in Middle Earth, he destroys the environment, including living forests, for his short-term gain, and he deliberately targets civilians in his military campaign. The seemingly omnipotent dark lord possesses powerful weapons of mass destruction including an air force of invincible wraiths, artillery and mobile divisions of Orks and other insensate humanoids. Equally as powerful is his surveillance system, a large telepathic eye that provides him with total information awareness. Although his plans for global hegemony of Middle Earth really require no assistance, the dark lord allies himself with a formerly benign wizard who serves as the junior partner of his invasion plans. By the time the other nations of Middle Earth form a defensive alliance against the dark lord, it appears to be too late. Realizing that the only way to stop the evil leader is to destroy the ring of power, Frodo, Sam, and company head to Mount Doom in order to cast it into the flames from which it was forged. Realizing that he must prevent them from doing this, the dark lord launches a preemptive strike against Minas Tirath, and Gondor, with the eventual goal of conquering the third part of this axis, the Shire itself.<br />The battle scenes that follow are fantastic, and I won'tdescribe them in detail for fear of giving anything away, but it is safe to say that they involve multiple simultaneous effects based operations whose purpose is to achieve rapid dominance. This film is entertaining, largely faithful to the text, and timely.
6305784116|5.0|I would have to give this  5 stars for the movie and 2 stars for the rest of the dvd. The Aristcats could also be called a sequel to 101 Dalmations, but this time it is only 4 cats that has to find thier way home instead of 15. Then you enter an ally cat name Thomas O'Malley thas aksed for help in return to the city of Paris in 1910. This movie took the Disney animators almost 4 years to make. Looks like every animators are still from Walt Disney days including Frank Thomas (who at the time of this writing) is still alive, but not very active, in fact looks like the last movie he worked on is The Fox and the Hound. As the movie opens, a woman named Madame Adelaide Bonfamille (Hermoine Baddeley) has come hom to her mansion, and awaits her lawyer (Charles Lane) to do her will in which, because of she has no living relatives, she decides to leave her house to her cats, and after the cats die, then the house goes to her butler Edgar (Roddy Maude-Roxby), and when Edgar over hears Madame's plane over a speaker, he decides to kid nap her cat Duchess (Eva Garbor) and kitness Marie (Liz English), Berlioz (Dean Clark), Toulouse (Gary Dubin), and he does that. And the Duchess and the kitness along with an alley cat named Thomas O'Malloy (Phill Harris), they make thier journey into Paris. This film was orginnlay intented to be a live action movie, but then somebody or somehow it got changed to an animated movie. And maybe some day a live action movie of this may be made, but if that does happen, for now you have this cartoon movie. This movie is a must for Disney or animated movie fans.
0316666343|5.0|This is a magnificent book in every way. I was moved to tears several times as I read it, and it still haunts me nearly a year after I finished it. This is one to buy, enjoy and then share with all your friends. One of the best I've ever read.
0780624890|5.0|This movie kicks butt! Aside from the fantastic special effects with the vampires, it also has some of the best fight choreography of any martial arts movie out there. <br />Wesley Snipes plays Blade, a half human, half vampire who hunts and destroys vampires for creating him in the first place. His mother, pregnant with him when she was bitten, gives birth to him before the transformation is complete. Thus, he has their powers, and none of their weaknesses. The perfect vampire...hunter.<br />Snipes uses similar fighting styles as those he used in Demolition Man with Sylvester Stallone. A combination of Karate, Aikido and Tae Kwon Do, it's awesome to watch. Vampires are dropping like flies.<br />The movie follows Deacon Frost, a vampire on a mission. He is hell-bent on resurrecting the Blood God, La Magra, and becoming the vessel for the Blood God to use. Blade must stop him at all costs.<br />The soundtrack to this film also rocks. If you have a home theatre, by all means...CRANK IT UP! It will blow you away. Buy this one today.
B00000K19E|5.0|I love this movie.  It will remain my top pick for a very long time.  My only complaint is not seeing it in the theatre.
0701168889|5.0|In food, and in words. If you enjoy cooking, this book is a complete culinary experience. There are recipies in this book that you will find nowhere else, and if you have a taste for british cuisine, her recipies are the best. Whether you actually cook from this book, or simply read through it, you will enjoy Nigella.
B00005JLWN|3.0|Christian Bale stars as a man that starts to have emotion and feeling in a world where it's a crime. The film starts out with him as a cop fighting and killing people who feel. A prisinor played Emily Watson makes him curious to what it would feel like to have emotion. He then realizes that the right to feel and have emotion is worth fighting for. He decides to fight and stand up to the system he once stood for. The action is fun if not a little too quick and often even silly. I mean Christian Bale fights a bunch of cops just to defend a puppy for god's sake.<br />  Equilibrium has been called a Matrix rip-off among being called a rip-off of many other Sci-fi films. I think it stands on it's own though. It's a good movie if you look past the silly plot. The performances by Bale, Watson Sean Bean and Taye Diggs, the cool looking atmosphere and the action make it worth watching.
B00000G3Q4|3.0|This movie was definitely a good start to the Evil Dead trilogy.  This is however the one that is most like a true horror movie. The next two add comedy in and although are good movies, this one is by far the best.  This movie has a good bit of gore in it, but a decent story and okay acting make it a definite must see for people who enjoy horror movies.
B00003CXRP|4.0|This movie hammers home the idea, to me at least, that Tom Hanks deserves the Oscar. His acting ability amazes me. <br />This film harkens back to one of Tom's older films Joe Versus the Volcano, as the main character ends up on a deserted island. In this film, it's because of a plane crash in the pacific. The similarities between Cast Away and JVTV were numerous, with lots of bits of symbolism all through the film.<br />Chuck Noland (Hanks) is a Fed-Ex employee who is obsessed with time. Everything has to be done on time (the Fed-Ex motto). When things go wrong in the biz, they call him in. When he gets called away right before Christmas, he figures it's just a short trip. A few hours later, he's in the drink.<br />Trying to survive on the island only one concern. The other is keeping his sanity, which is apparently in short supply. Hanks delivers one of the best performances of his career in this film, which hardly got a second glance by critics.<br />While there are a few special effects in the film (the plane crash), the film is mostly centered on Hanks character and follows him while he tries to make some resemblence of a life on the island. Where's Gilligan, the Skipper and the professor when you need them?<br />Any Hanks fan should own this one. This is the one he got robbed of the Oscar on. You can repeat this mantra everytime you watch it. It's a slow constant flow-of-a-film, and is very dramatic and wonderful.  I would have liked more special features, so I didn't give it 5 stars.
B00008PW3Q|4.0|Ok, after listening to this CD numerous times, I have changed my review and give it 4 stars instead of 3 stars.  I still feel that a few of the songs are just ok, but most of the songs on here are great and a few are already classics.  Yes, it does sound a little like two solo albums thrown together on one CD but if you like Lindsey and Stevie then who cares?  How can you not like the guitar solos in \\"Murrow... and \\"Come\\", as well as Stevie's beautiful \\"Illume\\" and the very cute and catchy \\"Say You Will\\".  Other standouts for me are \\"What's the World Coming To\\", \\"Thrown Down\\", \\"Red Rover\\", \\"Silver Girl\\" and \\"Steal Your Heart Away\\".  Thanks FM for a great CD, it took you long enough!

B00005JLRT|3.0|StarTrek Nemesis is said to be the last film of the Next Generation cast. I think that's a shame because it would be am unworthy ending the series. I liked the film but it could of been better. The whole thing with Picard having a clone was silly, wasn't explained that well how he got cloned either. Date has a brother android that looks just like him and it's not explained too well where he came from either. What the film has going for is the special effects, action and the performances of Patrick Stewart and Brent Spiner. The under-rated StarTrek  First Contact is a much better film and the best of the next generation movies. If they couldn't of done better than that they shouldn't of made more Next Generation movies. That should of been the last one.
B000002UAR|2.0|...this album lived up to its reviews. <br />But, it doesn't.<br />A few good songs (Taxman, And Your Bird Can Sing) otherwise dominated by the orchestra backed Here, There &amp; Everywhere and Eleanor Rigby (the Turtles did a better &quot;Eleanor&quot; song) make this pretty bad.
6305232660|4.0|This movie was released within a month or two of Armageddon. They both deal with the same issue, an asteroid that's bearing down on the Earth. If the asteroid impacts the Earth, all life will be destroyed.<br />The film follows several interlinked plotlines. One involving an aging astronaut played by Robert Duvall, and quite well I might add. He adds the spice of age and wisdom to the group of astronauts who try to avert the disaster by placing nuclear warheads on the asteroid (Comet actually) and break it apart into pieces small enough to be burned up in the atmosphere.<br />Another plotline involves a reporter played by Tea Leoni who stumbles across the the truth of the comet's existence and threat to the earth. She is practically estranged from her father, who recently divorced her mother for a much younger woman.<br />Still another plotline involves a young boy named Beiderman, who actually discovers the comet in an amateur astronomy club. The young actor eventually became Frodo Baggins in Lord of the Rings, so his acting skills are quite respectable.<br />This film tugs at the heartstrings throughout, and is a good film to have on the shelf. I've watched it a number of times, and still get a tear in the eye each time I do. If you want testosterone-induced action, watch Armageddon, but if you want a good storyline with lots of emotion, as well as some action, get this one.
6305903182|4.0|As a critic, I judge a lot of movies, and I am kinda a famous one, but I will keep my name anynomous. After watching the orignial Scream, I viewed it as a gewl, a gem of it's own kind, it sparked a new genre of horror films that have been dead for nearly a decade. It was a classic and spinned off look alikes, such as I KNOW WHAT YOU DID LAST SUMMER, and many many others. In 1997 SCREAM 2 was released, and it was very dissapointing. It didn't have what it took to pass the predescessor. It was wasn't written richly, but a very bad let down. Now SCREAM 3 was released February 4th, 2000. And believe it or not, \\"the third time is the charm\\". SCREAM 3 didn't prove to be as good as the original, but better than the sequel. Scream 3 is full of surprises, that throw you off guard. You think it's planned the way the first two was written - but like what was said anything happens in the Trilogy, all rules are broken. Rany Meeks makes an appearnce, as his sister shows her a video tape before he died in Scream 2, explaining that in the Trilogy anything can happen, even Sydney can die. He says that a shot in the head, or freezing the villian will only kill him. The film opens up with two murdes like the predescessors. We see that Gale Weathers is giving a pep lecture at UCLA for journalist, wher she is pulled away and infomed about the two murders. Dewey has gained popularity throughout Hollywood helping on the set of STAB 3: RETURN TO WOODSBORO. Sydney Prescott is living in seculsion in her California home deep in the mountains going under a different name helping with a women's hotline. She recieves flashes of her Mother. Soon Gale meets with Dewey about the situation, where he seems he doesn't need her. After every murder, they keep leaving pictures of Sydney's Prescott's mother. Who is this killer? Who does he have to do with Sydney or her mother? SCREAM 3 is sure to keep you at the edge of your seat!

B00009L1TA|4.0|John Travolta plays Tom Hardy, a ex-military Ranger now DEA agent brought in by an old friend to investigate the disappearances and/or deaths of several Army Ranger trainee's and their legendary drill instructor, Sgt. Nathan West (Jackson), during an exercise at a basic training camp, Fort Clayton, in Panama.<br />Once Hardy gets there a series of different storys are told and changed by the trainee's that he question's on the events that occurred at this training camp. Which starts to form a huge question in the audiencies mind, WHO'S TELLING THE TRUTH? However by the end there is a huge climax and everything is explained and leaves you in half shock, half amazement. I recommend this movie to anyone who liked 'A Few Good Men' or 'Mission:Impossible'.<br />'Basic' has terrific performances by Samuel L. Jackson and John Travolta although a shaky performance by Connie Nielson. It also has great supporting acts from Giovanni Ribisi, Taye Diggs, and Brian Van Holt.
B000002UAU|2.0|If you were around in 1967, buy it for the nostalgia.  If not, I guarantee you that it will sound old and dated relative to today's music, as well as the music of the 90s, 80s, and 70s, and even some of the good music of the 1960s.<br />Track by track:<br />Sgt. Pepper - good, really rocks, sounds good even today<BR>Help From My Friends - dated<BR>Lucy - touted as psychedelic, but not really<BR>Getting Better - adequate song now used for commercials<BR>Fixing A Hole - weak<BR>She's Leaving Home - not rock, weak orchestra backed song<BR>Mr. Kite - very weak<BR>Within You - self indulgent song that Paul/John had to let George put on the album<BR>64 - weak, vaudeville like song.  Doesn't belong on a rock album<BR>Lovely Rita - adequate<BR>Good Morning - zzz<BR>Sgt. Pepper - good, but just a rerun of track one<BR>Day in the Life - two unfinished songs by John and Paul that George Martin spliced together.  OK.<br />Altogether was OK in 1967, but dated 35 years later as expected.
B00005V3Z4|5.0|I really liked this movie. It is a testament to good movies. I have friends tell me, &quot;Hey, this movie is confusing, therefore, I don't like it.&quot; Confusing is good, it leaves you still thinking of the film even after it's been turned off for a couple of days, which is what I think the director intended. If you really look at it, the film is not that confusing in and of itself. Yes, it deals with intelligent subject matter (wormholes and time travel). Yes, the movie throws you for a loop, creating the sense of confusion. The thing is, there are tons of movies that don't make a lick of sense (Lost Highway, or pretty much any David Lynch movie, which I think are all steaming piles of excrement), but people still like them. Give it a chance, and you will love it or hate it. Me, I loved it.
B00008K7AM|1.0|...here by Jeff Shannon.  The movie was panned by most critics and for good reason.  If you feel you really must watch it, do yourself a favor and rent it - 25 dollars is a lot of money for a movie that isn't worth 25 cents.
6304696566|4.0|Viewing quality seems to be sat. Delivery time was good. CD case however is thin card board with Chinese writing. I can only hope this is not a &quot;boot leg&quot; copy. This was a used CD listed as band new unopened. Maybe its just my opinion, but I was disappointed to buy a classic CD of the Duke which was covered with orietal writing. Next time i'll buy new.
B00000DHZJ|5.0|Jimi hendrix, one of the most infulential persons out there. people classify him as the best guitarist ever. he was good, but not THE BEST. he was a little overrated. i think probably vai, clapton, could out beat him now if he was alive.  but he is pretty much of one my favortie guitarist and will be remembered for making great music. this album shines. its great. i love the star spangeled banner...i can play it just like him!...go to mxtabs.net if u want to learn it. and this album is just good. jimi hendrix was a great guitarist its sad that he is dead. but his music still lives, and will always live with me. but not every song on here is good. but most are. especially purple haze. i love that song.....later :)
B00008CLOA|4.0|But truthfully it's still unquestionably good and worthwhile to listen to. Time is bar none one of the most spectacular songs ever written and recorded, and the other songs all have their merits as well. I recommend just buying it for the heck of it because in the end you'll become as addicted to it as I am.
B00005QY5Y|5.0|oh my god i love ryan adams yay! (incase you can't tell from my title!) my daddy forced me to listen to gold when i was doing my music homework like, a year ago or something, saying that it was the best album thing he'd ever heard.... i soon shut up when he played it! it really is the best cd i have ever heard in my entire...life! (even better than red hot chili peppers, white stripes and coldplay (my other obsessions!) -now that really is saying something!) i don't really know why i love it so much, but it hasn't left my room since my dad lent me it last year and i've broken several cd players, i listen to it that much! it just sounds so clear... and every single song is absolutely gorgeous. idon't really know what my favourite song is, it changes with my mood. at the moment, cos i'm quite sad (aww!) it's la cienege just smiled (did i spell that right?). that song made me cry the first time i heard it! actually, i think most of the songs made me cry , they were so good! so buy it now! it could turn you into a sad, tearful geek like me too (yippee!!!) yes stranger, buy it, and buy heartbreaker too cos it's also very fab or else! oh yeah his voice is stunning too..!
0783244320|4.0|Galaxy Quest is an obvious parody of Star Trek although non-Star Trek fans will enjoy it too.  I'm not a huge Tim Allen dan but he's great as the over-the-top actor turned starship captain who finds his one great success story is a little more real than he imagined.  Inventive story line, solid acting, and lots of humor keep the movie fun and moving.  Certainly not too deep, but just as certainly not a brain-dead comedy either.
B00005YW4H|5.0|Beautiful songs, exquisitely executed by this talented vocal artist.  I suspect she will not be a flash in the pan and this particular CD a classic &quot;must-have&quot; for almost anyone's collection.
B000002U82|3.0|I feel truly sorry for all who continue to praise this album. Many other albums like Madman across the Water, The Wall, Let It Bleed, Chicago Transit Authority, even Bat Out of Hell, all surpass this album with flying colors. The world must be full of sheep who continue to just follow the crowd and not think for themselves, because if they really thought long and hard, they will see what a merely okay album Dark Side really is. Time is indeed one of the greatest songs ever made, and is a glorious masterpiece of music, but the rest of this album doesn't even touch it. Not by a long shot. If you must get it to finally be able to hear the full, un-edited, complete, and original version of Time, then by all means do so. Just don't praise the rest of the songs too, don't call it a concept album or art or anything else, and definitely DO NOT say this is one of the greatest albums of all-time, because it is NOT!!! It may be addictive, but other albums are indeed better.
0385504209|5.0|Okay, this book is definitely plot-driven, and there's not a lot of character development, but that's beside the point in a book like this. This book teems with secret societies, cryptography, exotic puzzles, and fascinating historical detail.  If you liked the Indiana Jones movies, or if you have even a passing interest in the history of religion, the Holy Grail, the Knights Templar, and/or a great mystery that clips along from plot twist to plot twist, then this book will suck you in and not let you go.

B000000OMP|5.0|This album is one of my all time Favorites! If I was stranded on a desert island, and could have only five albums with me this would definitely be one of them!! I had to replace it on vinyl at least three times, I played it that much, before I got it on cd. I saw the band on this tour (in 1984) as a special guest to Quiet Riot. I was Blown Away!!!(So was QR-right off of the stage!) From the title track on, it rocks! Mind you, I am reviewing the AMERICAN version of the album. I am still looking for the UK version on Cd.(The UK version has the songs in a different order.) This is the last really true Whitesnake album (recorded as a six piece band). With the AWESOME rhythm section of the Late GREAT (RIP)Cozy Powell on drums-Check out the way he thunders into Slow An' Easy, and also into the last segment of Guilty Of Love! (My absolutely FAVORITE song!) And the HUGELY underrated Neil Murray on bass (Colin Hodgkinson is the bassist on the UK version.) holding down the backline the rest of the musicians can go all out. With Mel Galley and John Sykes (it's MG and Micky Moody on the UK version) on guitars and Deep Purple's Jon Lord on keyboards to fill out the rest of the sound, David Coverdale can truly sing his best! My favorite songs are Slow An' Easy, Guilty Of Love, Love Ain't No Stranger and Standing In The Shadow. This is an album I can really rock out to! Okay, so maybe some of the lyrics are sexist, but I don't care! (What do you expect from somebody who named their band WHITESNAKE? Think about it folks!) This is truly Classic British Rock. This is in no way a hair band. If you see any band photos or videos from this era you can see this is before DC started to do up the glam/glitzy/bleached hair thing!
0802130208|5.0|The words often found between the torn and tattered pages of waterlogged books are seldom those of pure brilliance, and not pure as in real, but pure as in straight from the depths of the earth spring water pure. In John Kennedy Toole's Confederacy of Dunces, pure brilliance cannot describe the literature present. Artistic views and ideals flow from the pages like a waterfall, sticking in the depths of the readers' brain, forever more, till death do you part.<br /> Brilliance is proclaimed in the first paragraph of the first page, with the eloquent and detailed description of the main character. <br />\\" A green hunting cap squeezed the top of the fleshy balloon of a head. The green earflaps, full of large ears and uncut hair and the fine bristles that grew in the ears themselves, stuck out on either side like turn signals indication two directions at once. Full pursed lips protruded beneath the bushy black moustache and, at their corners, sank into little folds filled with disapproval and potato chip crumbs. In the shadow under the green visor of the cap Ignatius J. Reilly's supercilious blue and yellow eyes looked down upon the other people waiting under the clock at the D. H. Holmes department store, studying the crowd of people for signs of bad taste in dress.\\"<br />It is inconceivable that anyone would not want to read this book. A modern day Don Quixote, Ignatius proclaims his fame early in the book, making a scene regardless of his actual actions. He is accused of being a `vagrant' by an Officer Mancuso, and after an on foot chase scene through the streets of the French Quarter, New Orleans, Ignatius' mother, a blatant alcoholic, hurdles her car into the side of a building after a little too much of grandpa's old cough medicine, and sends Ignatius out onto the street.<br />How a person like Ignatius could ever survive in the world today is by all means, implausible. He appears to have a knack for finding just the wrong place to be at just the right time. He isa failure at alphabetizing anything, and could never sell any kind of food if his life depended on it, because regardless of how bloated he becomes, he seems to never stop eating. He somehow finds his way to a strictly gay party, attempts a speech, is hurled into the street, and becomes the mantle piece of an illegal-deal crack down. How one person, especially someone such as this, could ever get themselves into these kinds of situations is most likely the only unbelievable part of this book.<br /> But the brilliance is not in Ignatius, although he pertains to be the smartest character in the book. The driving forces behind this book are the supporting characters. Many books today have main characters that develop throughout the book, also known as a round character. In these books, the supporting characters are the ones that always stay the same, a flat character. Toole had the audacity to flip the system, and play with it. Ignatius J. Reilly on page 394 is the same Ignatius J. Reilly as the one on page 1, aside from a few more bruises, physically and mentally. Mrs. Trixie, Mrs. Reilly, Mr. Levy, Mrs. Levy, Officer Mancuso, and Gonzalez all become different people, because of Ignatius. This talented and artistic style of writing is sure to bring about new and creative styles that no one will be able to resist.

1400034779|5.0|This was such a nice surprise to find when doing my usual browsing at the book store! And so exciting to find there were three more books in the saga!<BR>Right after reading all four, I met a woman who had been in the Peace Corps in the 70's and had stayed in Botswana for eight years. Her description reaffirmed my desire to visit.<BR>It is not so much a description of the land and atmosphere that makes you want to hop on a plane, but of the people there and how straightforward and uncomplicated everything seems to be.
B000000OYN|5.0|In the mid 80's I went in search of the entire 'Snake back catalog (on vinyl, of course!). When I found this I was happy. I immediately loved it. My favorite track is Here I Go Again. This, to me is the REAL version of the song, with the original lyric; &quot;Like a HOBO, I was born to walk alone.&quot; (It was changed to DRIFTER, in 1987.) I LOVE the more bluesy sound of the song. Far superior to the 1987 remake. The same goes for this version of Crying In The Rain. I also love the title track, Bloody Luxury, and Victim Of Love, all of which truly rock! Definitely a classic! I highly recommend this for anyone who wants to hear a truly cohesive band. The guitars of Micky Moody (one of Britains most underrated slide guitarists!) and Mel Galley are great! The rhythm section of Neil Murray on bass, Deep Purple's Ian Paice (drums) and Jon Lord (keyboards) really hold it together.
B000005DQR|5.0|A 5-star desert island disc from an &quot;electronic&quot; dj album? How is that possible? Well, it's a beautiful album, almost a work of art.  And it's amazing listening to this today (midway thru 2003) how good this still sounds, some 7(!) years later. I've owned it since probably 1996 and somehow it's a timeless classic disc that is still primed for repeat latenight listening.<BR>Very highly recommended.
B00008WG3U|5.0|I've read a few reviews after many listens of the new album (and there will be many many MANY more in the future), and am very upset with many of the critics.  Simply put, this album is everything I wanted and more.  I've been a fan since ribbed and have enjoyed watching this band grow over the years.  Most recently, after pump up the valuum, I was dissapointed.  valuum was good but that is all it was: good.  Not a breakthrough, not a classic top notch album, just pretty good.  The first time I listened to this album I was blown away.  Holy hell, amazing riffs, great catchy lyrics and a lots of politics.  And more ska, I missed when NOFX played regaee and ska riffs (something they did great and should not have stopped doing).  They're still punk as hell, taking a stand for what they believe in and still have something to say after all these years.  What more do you want?  My advice: buy this album now!  Thank you for so many great memories Fat Mike, Hefe, Eric and Erik.
B00000JMQE|5.0|Return to Oz has always been one of my favorite films.  It is very different from the Wizard of Oz, but Return to Oz is much closer to Baum's Oz books.  The movie is based on Baum's books Ozma of Oz and The Marvolous Land of Oz.  Many people will not even watch this great film simply because it does not contain the same cast as The Wizard of Oz.  While mostly everone else has not even heard of this film.  This film is indeed a hidden classic and I know that one day it will be looked upon as one of the greatest films ever made.  This is one movie that no one can be dissapointed in buying.  The Wizard of Oz is my all-time favorite movie and I approve Return to Oz as a perfect addition to the Oz story.
B0000931QR|5.0|I didn't think I could love this band anymore and then they come out with another amazing CD.  I don't think there has ever been an Oreja De Van Gogh song I didn't just love. And Amaia is just the most beautiful talented singer ever. I highly recommend this album.
B0000931OG|5.0|Did anyone really care that much for Blur after Song 2?  Be honest. Unless you were a hardcore Britpop fan, you took your `woo-hoo's' and got the hell out of the Blur headlights.  You could argue that 1999's 13 saw the same amount of media coverage with its milk carton lovers video for `Coffee and TV', but really, nothing touches the kinetic kick to the scrotum of Song 2.  It really is a shame too.  Besides those who missed out on the London Calling-by-way-of-90's splendor of 13, many will miss out on this year's fabulous Think Tank.  If 13 was London Calling, Think Tank is undoubtedly Blur's take on Sandinistas! Dub and electronic influences are injected into Blur's bloodstream on Think Tank.  What makes the record so inviting is its variety and its ability to rock with the vacancy left by guitar wizard Graham Coxon.  Coxon's signature was all over 13, especially on the fuzzed out glory of `Bugman' and the melancholic ballad `No Distance Left to Run'.  But on Think Tank, the band becomes an autonomous brigade of noise and melody.  Opener `Ambulance' buzz's and snaps under a wave of saxophone as master crooner Damon Albarn swoons; \\"I ain't got anything to be scared of, cause I love you\\". On the sweaty `On My Way to the Club', Alex James' bass snarls under a dreamy affect laden guitar.  `Caravan' sulks like depressive trip hop but is elevated by a zombie chorus of \\"la-la-la's\\" and a disturbing guitar line.  For those who fear that Blur have totally gone awall, don't worry.  `Crazy Beat' and `We've got a File on You' stem from the blistering fuzzed out rock of Song 2 and Bugman.  And the ballads are better than ever.  `Sweet Song' pleads to be played on a teen drama when 2 virgins make love for the first time.  On another note, `Good Song' bounces on a trampoline acoustic guitar line but succumbs into a wondrous summer love ballad.  The clear standout is `Gene by Gene', a reggae-by-way-of-sampling stunner that shows Albarn blending some of his Gorillaz magic into theBlur camp.  Throughout, Albarn lyrics are still on par with his best and Dave Rowntree does some interesting kit work in the process.  Think Tank recalls a more varied and better version of the Smashing Pumpkins' electronic departure Adore.  Blur have grown into a new band and have, in the process, found an inner ability to cut loose and have fun.
B00008G9JN|5.0|This review is more to defend Tull in general and this remastered album in particular, than to split hairs about its finer points (esp. after having read some reviews ripping into it).<br />Tull's music has always been DIFFERENT. You either love it or you don't. To all you Tull fans out there: this album is a good buy. The remastering has made the music more crisp, and you can now hear notes and complexities that weren't apparent before. However, I have to agree with some of the other reviewers in saying that the live version of Velvet Green doesn't really add anything to the album.<br />Yes, there are many Tull albums that are insipid. But Songs from the Wood is NOT one of them. It is a masterpiece. To some of you who've thrown brickbats at it, I have only this to say: Cloth Ears!
078322608X|5.0|Leaning more toward 4.75 stars here...<br />I love Terry Gilliam, I truly do. But so much of his work suffers from too much creativity (Brazil, Baron Munchausen, etc.) that his brilliant vision often turns into clutter and noise. He needs a steadier hand to guide him at times, and we've found it with David People's marvelous screenplay.<br />12 Monkeys is Gilliam's most disciplined, moving and thought-provoking film precisely because we are able to relate to its ideas surrounding insanity, paranoia and doomsday.<br />Bruce Willis is a convict in a dystopian future where nearly all of mankind has been killed off by a super-virus unleashed in 1996. The survivors live underground like rats and the animals (immune to the virus) are the only creatures on the surface. He is recruited to go back in time to retrieve a sample virus so that the scientist plutocrats who rule his society can develop a vaccine.<br />OK, typical plot developments occur, right? \\"Bruce, back in the 1990s, is considered a crack-pot and a looney and he's locked up. He's got to get out and complete his mission and there's one person who can help: Dr. Kathryn Reilly, psychiatrist and do-gooder.\\"<br />But wait, there's more. So much more, including Brad Pitt (in my favorite performance as the maniac who may be behind the virus); complex time travel that effectively distorts YOUR idea of what's real; man's corruption of the earth; and a vision of humanity's collective madness that only Gilliam could capture.<br />Because at the center is Bruce Willis as James Cole. A violent person hardened by life, but who can also listen to a song on the radio with the relish of a child. Madeleine Stowe is at her most luminous as Dr. Reilly, and the love that develops between them is neither unecessary or contrived. After all, love is their last grasp at what what it means to be real. Everything else is just a collection of artifacts.
6305508550|4.0|First off, let me say that this movie is incredible!  I have seen it probably close to 30 times, and it's still a pleasure to watch!  This is one of those rare movies that actually gets better the more you watch it.  If you haven't seen this movie, do yourself a favor and go ahead and buy it.  Don't bother renting it, because you will just want to watch it again and again.  Unfortunatley, the DVD is lacking.  There is no special features really, besides a cast bio.  I would really have loved to have gotten some additional scenes or something along those lines.  But like i said before, the movie more than makes  up for it.
B000063Y8F|5.0|I had resisted purchasing this item because of what seemed to be an exorbitant price, but now that I have used it I am sorry that I waited so long.  After years of dealing with more 'reasonably' priced garlic presses, this press is a revelation.  So easy to use! So easy to clean!  I love the way the perforated section of the press swings out for easy cleaning.  Some of the other premium garlic presses list a cleaning tool; just one more thing to get lost in a busy kitchen.  And as well as being intelligently designed, it is sturdily constructed; I doubt that I will bend this tool, as I have with lesser makes.  After using this garlic press, I expect I will be tempted into upgrading to other Rosle tools.

B000002KBA|5.0|&quot;In Rock&quot; consists of hard tracks with scorching tone from the thundery intro of &quot;Speed King&quot;, through Blackmore's intense solo in &quot;Child in Time&quot; to very strong masterpiece &quot;Hard Lovin' Man&quot;.

I have the anniversary CD, and it holds also full length version of &quot;Black Night&quot;(&quot;30 Very Best of Deep Purple has also &quot;Black Night&quot;, but it fades out in the middle of the outro solo), remix versions of &quot;Speed King&quot;, and &quot;Flight of the Rat&quot;. It has also unreleased track &quot;Jam Stew&quot; and &quot;Cry Free&quot;. Between the bonus tracks is heard some chatting in the studio.<br />Briefly, if your hard-rock tooth aches, you better check this out...
B00006RU5B|5.0|I have always been a huge RATM fan and a pretty big fan of Soundgarden.  But when I heard of Audioslave, I wasnt expecting anything of this high of quality.  I was unbelievably impressed with every track on the CD.  Cornell shows his talents as a vocalist and Morello shows his amazing ability as a guitarist, while Tim and Brad complete the sound that is called Audioslave.  As other reviewers have mentioned, this CD is not hardcore nu-metal or any new genre.  It is just plain good ol' rock'n'roll.  Standout tracks on the album are difficult to decide on such an excellent CD, but I would reccomend: Show Me How to Live, Light My Way, Exploder, Gasoline, and The Last Remaining Light.  In my opinion one of the best rock albums to come out in the 21st century and my favorite CD by far right now.
0671015206|5.0|It's the same advice most of parents taught us: Save your money and don't blow it all on status items.  The beauty of this book is that it summarizes and elaborates on those same key points in a factual, non-judgemental manner. <br />I especially appreciated the information on how some  millionaires raise their children to be functional, independant adults. Our family income is rising and, with young children, this part of the book holds special relevancy for me.<br />All in all, it's good food for thought.
B00000JCOV|2.0|This used to be a 5-star review, and I used to really love this band. No, I didn't listen to them because of all the \\"angst\\" and \\"image\\" everyone complains about. I used to listen to them because I like the music. I'll give them that. This band was kind of like a gateway for me. When I first heard this cd and Iowa, I thought they were way too heavy for me. But I grew to like them. And then, I started browsing this site for other heavy bands. Then I discovered bands like Opeth, In Flames, Morbid Angel, Meshuggah, Iced Earth, Death, and countless other great metal bands that you never see on TV or hear on the radio. And here is where Slipknot's problem is.... compared to all these bands, they are just weak! There is a ton of nu-metal stylings, no guitar solos, and it just doesn't sound as good as any of these bands. So while I don't really hate Slipknot like many \\"true metalheads\\" do (they did get me into heavy music after all), I can't deny the fact that they are nowhere near good as many of these underground bands. If you like this band, check out some of the other bands listed. I guarauntee you will like them a lot more than Slipknot. They will open up a whole new world of metal bands to you.

B000002UAU|5.0|I'm in my 20's, the son of hip hop and wacky, generic rock music. I have recently been going back, enthralling myself in the CLASSICS. And, you know what what? This album, is a classic....I listened it to it for the firt time very recently. I drove into the ARIZONA NIGHT, and for 40 minutes I tried to place the music, society, and the Beatles in some sort of timeline of human and music history.....i got THE GOOSEBUMPS as I heard &quot;I'll get by with a little help from my friends&quot; and the guitar intro was dislocating, the feeling that I was listening to a first, i knew that this sound, this combination of voice, instrumentation, and lyrics were profound in their influence. I cannot get over this album right now.......it is on REPEAT  in my car cd player.......YOU HAVE TO GET THIS ALBUM to appreciate MUSIC and life in general.
B000002HPV|3.0|Ok, I've been sleeping under a rock for the past 5 years in my post R&B and Hip-Hop only music life. Here I was introduced to Bjork by a friend of mine who played \\"It's in our hands\\". That was a very nice song that seemed shrouded in mystery and in darkness. Which is a format of which I've come to like. Then comes Homogenic to my mailbox. The weird cover was almost a turn off. Anyway, to the music. I've been a fan of what people call \\"Trip-Hop\\" and this seems sort of like it. I liked most of the songs including \\"Joga\\", but \\"Pluto\\" is a sorry excuse for a song. It is extremely awful and is probably one of the worst songs I've ever heard. That song alone drops something off of my rating. Where was the quality production with that song? It sounds heavily distorted and downright crazy. To listen to that song more than once would be torture. For the most part, her songs strike me as part strange and part mystery. Which can be cool in some respects. Is there any way to permanently delete tracks off of a CD? Besides Track 9, I enjoyed the music, but Bjork's voice kind of irritates me. So I'm not sure how much of a fan of hers I may become.
B00008S2VG|2.0|Though perhaps not the disaster predicted in some quarters, it is her worst studio album to date. <br />Yes, its even worse than 'Bedtime Stories'.<br />In 'Hollywood', 'American Life' and 'Die Another Day', the albums best tracks, we get Madonna at her most heart-breakingly  average. <br />The album is, at best a 5th rate carbon copy of the excellent 'Music' album, something which makes it all the worse. It is one of the only suprises of the record - that, for the first time in her career, she simply regurgitates an old formula. <br />The other rather awful surprise is the cringe inducing rapping on such tracks as 'Mother and Father' - sample lyrics &quot; My mother died when I was five/And all I did was sit and cry/I cried and cried and cried all day..My father had to go to work/<BR>I used to think he was a jerk&quot;<br />Don't waste your money on this. Buy 'Music' instead.
0156027321|4.0|At first, it was great. The characters are so real it seems like a memoir. That's what's great about this novel, not the wackiness and originality of it(that makes it unforgettable), but the fresh skill with which Martel creates. Then again, if you love wackiness and originality, grab this book.. But don't be disappointed that it all gets stranger, and stranger, and characters do the same; the thing is though, they stay that way, for better or for worse, in your mind.
B00008NG5V|4.0|Another great album from Jack who is showing that he has really found a niche in the market. His laidback acoustic sounds are perfect for a quiet night when you want to kick back and relax. The studio versions of some of his live favourites have been taken down a peg or two in the tempo department and in my opinion could have added an interesting contrast to the ultimately 'slow' feeling to the album especially 'holes to heaven'. For Jack fans, the songs are more of what we want, for those who haven't heard him, this album is sure to place him on the musical map, and for those of you who didn't like the  seemingly repetitive songs and slow pace of brushfire fairytales, well just don't listen to this because it's more of the same. <BR>The only dissapointment was the relatively short length of the songs mostly around 2:40/3:00 mark.<BR>highlights include Horizon Has Been Defeated, Times Like These<BR>Rodeo Clowns, Taylor and gone.

What ever happened to the live quadrophenia show that King Biscuit was supposed to release ?<BR>I'll stick with my vinyl on this one.
0446677450|5.0|This book made me realize that many of the ideas I had were not far-fetched. I have always firmly believed that anyone, anyone at all can not only be rich, but wealthy even. All it takes is the proper mindset, something that I believe this book can definitely do for you. Short and quick read, well worth the [money]. <br />This is not a cheesy, self-help book or one of those get rich quick scam-type things! This is not a book that lectures the reader on what they do wrong, it is simply a book that opens your mind to the right way to live your life.
B000002KOY|5.0|This hard-rocking little gem features a supergroup of sidemen working at a high level of skill and passion. Crazy Horse is Neil Young's backup group--the original group, which was comprised of Danny Whitten on guitar, Billy Talbot on bass, and Ralph Molina on drums. For this album, however, they added three significant ringers: Nils Lofgren, who had played on Neil's \\"After the Goldrush\\" album, and would eventually have a solo career before joining Bruce Springsteen's E Street Band; Ry Cooder, the famed slide guitarist who played with the Rolling Stones, John Hiatt, Randy Newman, Ravi Shanker and the Buena Vista Social Club; and Jack Nitzche, who (among other things) was an arranger for Phil Spector, had his own hit in the early 60s with the lushly orchestrated \\"Lonely Surfer,\\" and helped Neil Young assemble two of his greatest Buffalo Springfield tunes, \\"Broken Arrow\\" and \\"Expecting to Fly.\\"<br />Shortly after this album came out, Danny Whitten died of a drug/alcohol reaction--one of the two premature deaths documented on Young's \\"Tonight's the Night.\\" The degrees of separation, ranging from the early 60s girl groups to \\"The Rising,\\" span much of U.S. rock and roll history--which all seems to come together in one place, on this unassuming little album full of deceptively simple, great tunes.<br />It opens with a churning version of an obscure Randy Newman song, \\"Gone Dead Train,\\" that sturdily rocks you toward the one Neil Young cover, \\"Dance Dance Dance,\\" a countrified song that features the fiddler Byron Berline. The first of several Whitten originals, \\"Look at All the Things,\\" establishes his primary mode--simple tales of heartache. I can't figure out why I like his songwriting so much. It's simple stuff, but it holds up, and works well in a rock band context. \\"Look at All the Things,\\" for example, has a very cool vocal arrangement that has a Mozart-like echoing effect. After a Nils Lofgen tune, the psychedelic \\"Beggars Day,\\" another Whitten song appears, the classic \\"I Don't Want to Talk About it.\\" This tune, played here with Cooder's slide guitar accompanying the lovely little acoustic rhythm figure, is vivid and emotionally delicate. As you may recognize, this is the original version of a tune that Rod Stewart covered some years later with much success. Crazy Horse's version, however, is better.<br />It's followed by \\"Downtown,\\" a song that appears to be about scoring drugs. In what was meant to be an ominous gesture, Young put a version of the same song on \\"Tonight's the Night.\\" But on this album, it sounds like an anthem of joy: \\"Come on baby let's go downtown, let's go let's go let's go downtown/ Come on baby, let me turn you around now, turn you turn you turn you around!\\"<br />Of the remaining songs, \\"Carolay\\" is a highlight--the connection with Phil Spector made explicitly with the urgent piano opening that sounds like a flipped-over version of \\"Doo Doo Ron Ron.\\" I also love the bluesy \\"Crow Jane Lady,\\" the one song written and performed by Nitzche--a weird but enjoyable finale.<br />At the time he died, Whitten was mourned more as a tragic life cut short by substance abuse, and not so much as an artist of consequence whose work would be missed. This album was in my collection as an LP back then, mostly because I was a Neil Young fan. I liked it a lot, but when I converted to CDs, it never occured to me it would be re-released. But here it is, it's really great, it's rock history that also packs a very enjoyable punch. And, with the passage of time, you realize that the world is indeed a poorer place for the loss of Danny Whitten, the songwriter who gave us \\"I Don't Want to Talk About it,\\" \\"Downtown\\" and \\"Carolay.\\" As the years since then have shown, there is nothing easy about writing a great rock song.lassic \\"I Don't Want to Talk About it.\\" This tune, played here with Cooder's slide guitar accompanying the lovely little acoustic rhythm figure, is vivid and emotionally delicate.

B00008J2DQ|4.0|Godsmack's 2003 follow up to \\"Awake\\" may not be flawless, but its still a really good album. The set features the band's traditional rock sounds, only with a little more edge this time around. Just check out lead single \\"Straight Out Of Line\\" and you'll get the feel of the album. Many of the songs have the band focusing on hatrid and betrayal, such as the title track \\"Faceless\\" and \\"I ... Hate You\\". Other songs, like \\"Changes\\", do the same but with a different vibe. This time, Godsmack means business. The album also includes the hard-rocking anthem from the Scorpion King Sountrack \\"I Stand Alone\\" (this track is incredible live, i saw Godsmack with Breaking Benjamin and (hed) P.E a couple weeks ago, this track blew me away!). In all, this is the band's best effort, the last track, with the indian stuff at the beginning, totally sums up the album. The most angry, but yet the best, seems you'd find that predictable with Godsmack.

B00006LI4S|5.0|Every Pink Floyd fan should have this in their collection. The band will never be together again so grab what you can. I think that this is a great piece of work. David is at the top of his career, and his guitar playing ability, and the band fill's in behind him quite well. After viewing this DVD, I realized that this is Pink Floyd Unplugged. With Gilmour being the driving sound out of the band, he is now the front man (showing some extra pounds though). If you don't like guitar, and Gilmour playing it, don't buy this. All his guitar solo's are clean, and have no distortion (except one). So it really is a treat to see how good of a player he is. The music is put together so well! The backing vocals, the stand-up bass, and the cello, and the simplicity of complex songs, I caught myself watching this with my jaw open. Even people who don't know Pink Floyd, David Gilmour, or even Rock-n-Roll will find this entertaining. Gilmour's solo's are not long like when he's playing live with Floyd but, you get to see him play something different than his red Fender Strat. The extras on the DVD are great too. You get to see a home video of him practicing with the chorus, and all the work that goes into just that aspect of the show. Also included are some singles, one of which shows some footage of his floating sound studio on the Thames River in England. By far the best thing I have see out of any member of Floyd in recent history. P.S. I love Roger Waters, get the DVD \\"In the Flesh\\" too.
B000069HZP|5.0|What happens when you are a powerful multi-millionaire and have everything you ever wanted?  While you and I might think this situation is highly desirable, for Nicholas Van Orton, played by Michael Douglas, it is very boring.  In fact, you might say that Nicholas is miserable.  However, Nicholas' brother Conrad Van Orton, played by Sean Penn, has bought Nicholas a gift for his 48th birthday, an invitation to play &#34;The Game.&#34;<br /><br />From this point forward the movie drags for what seems forever.  I was beginning to regret watching this movie.  Looking back, though, I now know that this beginning helps us to more fully understand how boring and awful Nicholas's life is, and provides an excellent contrast with what happens later in the movie.<br /><br />Nicholas is in a very upscale restaurant when a waitress (Deborah Unger as Christine) spills wine on his shirt.  Christine is fired by the restaurant manager and leaves, very upset.  Before you can say white rabbit, a waiter rushes by Nicholas' table and drops off a note that tells Nicholas to follow the girl.  Prepare for the roller coaster ride.<br /><br />Within moments Nicholas finds himself involved with an apparently dying man, then just as quickly he finds he is being chased by the police, and police dogs, and things just get worse and worse.  The list of things to which Nicholas is subjected is too long to describe, and would leave you with no surprises.<br /><br />Nicholas tries to figure out how to make all the action and events to which he is being subjected stop.  Nicholas can't handle the loss of control.  Further, the chaos of his experiences seems to follow no pattern or order.  Eventually Nicholas gets back to where he thinks it all began for a showdown that left me surprised and amazed.  You'll have to watch the end for yourself.<br /><br />There are several lapses in credibility, but unless you are an obsessive control freak (sort of like Nicholas Van Orton, for instance) you'll likely consider the lapses minor.  This movie ultimately is an intelligent thriller that relies on action only when necessary to heighten Nicholas' fears and to pull him into what seems like a deeply nefarious conspiracy.  After watching, this movie became one of my favorites, and I've now seen it several times.<br /><br />The most difficult part of this movie is the relatively slow first part.  However, have patience; what you learn in the first part helps you to understand Nicholas and to be drawn more fully into his situation.  Sympathy with Nicholas and his situation is highly desirable to fully appreciate the end of the movie.  I was sympathetic, and enjoyed this movie.  5 stars for an intelligent thriller that relies on intelligent plot versus guns, fast cars and special effects.<br /><br />Enjoy!an intelligent thriller that relies on action only when necessary to heighten Nicholas' fears and to pull him into what seems like a deeply nefarious conspiracy.

B00005U122|5.0|I was at the concert, I own the CD, and now I have the option to relive that night again and again. What more can a Floyd fan want? As mentioned in the other reviews, this is the whole concert, and it sounds awesome. To achieve that level of mixing a live concert is very impressive, and shows that Roger Waters is indeed a master, what an ear.  I do have to say that I miss David Gilmour though. Sure Snowy White and Doyl Bramhall II do a great job, but there is only one David Gilmour. The fact that Snowy plays a Gibson most of the time, is a bit confusing to me. Since very rarely did Floyd ever use Gibson guitars but who wants to hear the song exactly like it is on the album? Never the less, it's a must have for anybody who likes Roger Water's, or has not seen a Floyd show. Being an old Floyd fan, the tracks off Roger's solo stuff on this DVD are a pleasant surprise. And after listening to these live tracks, the original song's on the original CD's pail in comparison to me. The extra footage on this DVD is great too. You get to see the making of the tour. If you are a Pink Floyd fan, get this DVD, you will not be disappointed!
B000089RVX|5.0|I sift through these reviews and shake my head in amazement. For every review that bashes Evanescence, there are 25 that praise them. I have been listening, playing, writing, and enjoying music for 20 years, and can say this with the utmost confidence, Evanescence is singular. Amy Lee may very well be the most gifted vocalist on the planet. Her haunting sound is something that pulled me into this CD from the very first note I heard her belt out. Ben Moody, while not the most accomplished guitarist on the rock scene is most surely a gifted writer. This may be one of the most justified CD purchases I have ever had the pleasure of making. The songs range from prog-rock to haunting anthems of pain and loss, the music is ethereal, the writing is top notch. Evanescence is energy, synergy, life. One only needs to &quot;listen&quot; to Tourniquet or Hello to understand that this is a band that is here to stay.
B000001G6W|5.0|Universal / DG have just released a 2 CD set containing this famous performance coupled with the 5th and 6th symphonies from the same integral cycle , catalog number 474260-2. The Amazon ASIN # is B00008CLNP. The recording has been remastered at 96kHz with 24bit digital recorders. And it is worth a few extra $ ... just for the newer transfer of the Ninth. The balances are much more realistic and make for an incredible listening experience. I've known this recording for over 20 years. I've always had a slight dislike for the close microphone techniques of DG in the 70s, and this is a typical recording from that era. Too many close microphoned highlights of individual instruments or orchestra sections for brief moments. Well, I feel like I've discovered a new recording. Gone are the over dominating percussion moments, and the sound of violins being plucked is much more pleasant, especially bass violins. And the individual voices and parts of the chorus are much more distinguishable than in this Galleria copy. Just listen to the 3rd movement on both issues and you'll never want to hear the Galleria copy again.
0671027344|5.0|This book is, in a word, amazing. This book made me cry, laugh, scream, and in the end, it helped me. While many would say that some of the things Charlie experiences are a little too mature for the 'young adult' audience, I disagree. As a high school student, I could relate to 99% of the things he went through. The drugs, the sexuality in question, the abuse, all of it. If I could reccommend one book to anyone, anywhere, it would be this one. Please read it. It may help you, too.
B00008LDPU|5.0|I recently had the chance to view the entire Animatrix, and I walked away incredibly impressed. From the ultra-lifelike beginning of \\"Final Flight\\" to the ties-directly-to-the-Matrix-Reloaded ending, I really enjoyed it and more importantly I think that those who view this will enjoy it as well and be turned on the by possibility of adult animation (ie, anime). In some ways, I even believe that this is better than the Matrix Reloaded, because each individual peice (especially \\"The Second Reniassance I & II\\" - they are incredible) is so well done and so enthralling. This film is a treasure chest of animated gems, and should be cherished by any one who enjoyed The Matrix at all.
B000002B1M|5.0|This album is plain amazing! This is Nas' underated album behind Nastradamus. The beats and rhymes are exceptional! The messages are real and guest appearances shine.

B00005Q4CS|1.0|This film may serve as an excellent warning as to why people shouldn't abuse drugs, but overall it is a terrible film. <br />The characters are unsympathetic, with the exception of the mother (portrayed by Ellen Burstyn). Even more tragic than her unintentionally becoming a drug addict is that she is used as a comic relief. Her drug-induced hallucinations are cast as \\"funny\\" through most of the film. Of course, this might've been an attempt to \\"shock\\" the viewers into the seriousness of her situation, but it plays out as outright insensitivity. The successes of the other YOUNG characters, who bring their misfortunes and downfall on themselves, are glamorized. They have beautiful love scenes during the \\"good\\" part of their drug use cycles. The elderly lady? She thinks she is on TV and is afraid of her refrigerator. She is the only character who truly is likeable, yet she is the [center] of the joke. <br />More offensive than the mother being used as a figure of ridicule is what happens to her ultimately. Shock therapy? That's not a standard treatment for a psychiatric patients. Doctors ask about what medications patients take and wean them off drugs creating delusions, not trick them into signing consent forms. This is not a remotely accurate portrayal of how medicine operates on a daily basis. <br />Moving into cinematography, the camera tricks become tiresome after constant repetition. Do we really need to see everyone's iris dilate every time they snack crack? Do we need to the first-person perspective if someone is just walking into a store? After awhile, it's boring. <br />Despite these flaws, the film was watchable until the section with winter. (Note that they only portrayed 3 seasons, which kept you waiting for the 4th. Very annoying.) The film previously glamorized the young people to some extent, but then started showing their gradual reversal of fortune. Then, we suddenly are launched into outright sensationalization of the horrible things happening to them.  Jared Leto's character develops sepsis in his arm. Why didn't he go to the doctor earlier? It wasn't as if he indicated that he didn't want to go to the hospital because he was afraid of being arrested. He simply didn't go, even when it began to turn black. It makes no sense, unless your a director who wishes to include some disgusting shots of the worsening wound. Also, do we need to see Marion using the [...]with another woman? It was quite obvious already that she'd do anything for money. The end result was that I felt the director wanted to make me nauseous, not that he had a good reason for portraying these characters in such dire circumstances.

B00008RH3L|4.0|I take one star off for the time it took to get this to DVD. Otherwise, one of those movies I can watch over and over again, constantly seeking the little moments, gestures, scraps of dialogue, that I might have missed the first thirty times I watched it. The Coen Brothers have fashioned a truly believable gangster's world where everything is crooked, therefore predictable, therefore - ethical. Gabriel Byrne is wonderfully understated, Albert Finney is almost unrecognizable, Jon Polito's Caspar is pleasantly unpleasant - I can easily go on. The cast is superb, the cinematography is beautiful, the irony laid on thick (Finney killing his would-be assassins to the lilting strains of Danny Boy).Everyone else has mentioned the music, so I will, too - it's great. Highly recommended.<br />A moment from behind the scenes: the plot is so convoluted, the Coen Brothers had trouble figuring out where to go, so they wrote another script about a screenwriter suffering from writer's block - Barton Fink.
B000002J20|5.0|The song The Revealing Science OF God is just an amazing piece of material, and THE RITUAL .. these two are worth the price o' admission.  Very good.  these two songs wieve and bob around like two wrestlers, and make for good relaxing mood music.

1577311523|5.0|I have read this book several times.  Each time, I get something more out of it.  I must have read hundreds of spiritual development books during the last fifty years, including the New Testament of course, and this is by far the best and most USEFUL, even displacing \\"Zen in the Art of Archery\\" as number one.  The writing is clear and exact (despite being a native German, Tolle's vocabulary and command of English is very comprehensive), the message unambiguous, the format effective.  I have ordered Tolle's next book, but I doubt whether it will tell me more than this one does, even though I am expecting to enjoy it and profit by it.  Simply, \\"The Power of Now \\" contains all you need.  As Tolle himself says, he basically always talks about the same thing, and reading it again and again simply exposes one repeatedly to Presence and encourages one to come into the present moment, not to resist the present moment.
0679720200|4.0|The Stranger is one of the best reading experiences I have ever had.  This is the first book I have read by Albert Camus, and in fact I am not even aware of any of his other works.  However this book was enough for me to realize that he is truly a gifted writer.  The way he developed his characters really intrigued me.  I found that I was almost able to feel what Meursault was feeling, his frustrations, and his happy moments.  Camus did all this without rambling on and on with too many adjectives and other modifying phrases that just makes a story seem muddled.  I was also happy to see that he kept the entire novel relatively on the short side, making it enjoyable for someone, like myself, who just does not have the time to dedicate to reading a long drawn out book.  It's hard when a person can only find time every couple days to read and I think we should all thank Mr. Camus for writing a book that even with that little amount of time we have to read, we are able to enjoy it to its fullest.  <BR> <BR>The way Camus develops this story makes it that much more interesting.  Meursault, who has sort of the \\"anti-hero\\" role, manages to get himself entangled with the wrong group of people, and for no apparent reason, he senselessly kills a man. Meursault is then imprisoned on murder charges and after a while is brought before a jury for a rather absurd trial.  The proceedings are mostly nonsense, and are based upon technicalities and other worthless information, rather than the facts of the crime.  The end to the trial and the jury's sentence, which I will let you read for yourself, just further shows the absurdness of the entire trial.<BR> <BR>Toward the end of the story it becomes even more apparent how Meursault has become the \\"stranger\\" to society through his complete disassociation with the rest of the world.  Yes, he seems to show some emotion, but when it comes to anything deep, he shows none.  His girlfriend wanted to know if he still, or if he ever loved her.  The only thing that he can seem to come up with is, well maybe.  Maybe I never did.  He also showed little or no emotion for the death of his mother, finding peace in a few comedies, instead of showing signs of depression, anger, frustration, or even shedding tears.  These emotional and psychological issues show to me that there was obviously something deeply wrong with Meursault and that neither he nor anyone else was going to do anything about it.  Meursault is one of the best-developed characters that I have ever read about.  In fact it made me wonder if there was not someone in Mr. Camus's family that possibly had similar psychological issues to Meursault, and if so than that would explain how Camus was able to develop this character so well.  If there was no one that he knew first hand, than Camus deserves even more credit for developing a character was such great depth.<BR> <BR>I would have to say that some people may not find this book that interesting to them, some parts are a bit ambiguous, but if you think about those parts you find them clear enough to get through.  The characters, as I have said before, are described and developed so well that you will feel like you are one of them, along with what I felt was a fairly interesting story line. Even if you don't like the book you should be at least able to appreciate how well written this novel is.
B000003TA4|3.0|Many things have been said about Nirvana sophmore release Nevermind. Nevermind broke Nirvana into the mainstream and a certain kind of alternative music as well. Well I am not to preach what alternative music is however a lot of great acts that were around the time did not get any credit or sales even though their material was way better than this. So many great and original artist who still make excellent album recieved perhaps more attention for their works in the 1990´s that they would have gotten before but indeed it seemed though this album seem to change face of rock n roll . Rock ( especially in the US) was about being angry, fast and depressing and many other bands that would perhaps make it big in other countries were not velcomed by American Listeners even though they are a lot more alternative then some of the acts that recieve the same stamp.<br />However Nevermind has appeared in a lot of best of list around the years and many magazine rank it high as one of the greatest albums of all time. Is this album great. No. It is good but not great. <br />The problem lies in the songwriting. The fact was that Kurt only knew few chords and riffs and managed to write bunch of songs with them. Many of his songs sound the same and are pratically the same but with different lyrics and different tone. <br />The production is flawless however Butch vig who produced it did a very good job with about half of the tracks. Why do I say half well about 5 or 6 songs on this album are just noise. You can´t hear what Kurt is singing about and they are very poorly played. The fact is that Butch probably found it very difficult to do something outstanding with these tracks and tried best as he could. The fact that he should have take notes from Steve Albini who recorded and kind of produced Nirvana´s third album In Utero and just engineer and mix and skip making anything out of them except that. <br />Nevermind contains however some good such like Smells Like Teen Spirit, Lithium, In Bloom, Come As You Are, Breed, Polly, On A Plain but the rest is either bad or does not live up to the same qualities as the other songs. These songs are not raw but a plane bore. Perhaps the other members of the band should have helped by writing the other material sole without Kurt´s help. <br />The fact is that Nevermind seems like a half-finished album. When you skip these fillers you have 6 songs that are really good. I don´t care what this album did for the music business we should look at albums for what they are. These are disc or Vinyl with music on them. If the music is not good the album isn´t.<br />To this date many hail Nevermind as one of the rock´s greatest albums. It is a good album but certainly not one of rock´s greatest achievement in music history and certainly not one of Seattle´s grunge best album. The fact is that Kurt Copain was not just a singer-songwriter but he was like Madonna and others a new face in music that everyone wanted a piece of and he was prortrait to be cool and something new however he was not even close of being one of the greatest songwriters of his era he was just lucky. <br />Also is that before his death this album had sold 5 million in the US. After his death it has sold 10 million copies in the US. Pearl Jam sold 11 million copies of their album Ten and nobody died from that band.<br />Overall grade 6/10.
B00008IAMD|5.0|I have heard both Trent Reznor's and Johnny Cash's versions of HURT.  Trent's version speaks from a young person's point of view and is fine...but in the hands...and voice...and soul of Johnny Cash, it takes on a resonance and meaning that NIN can't even begin to touch.  I have seen the video and listened to the song numerous times and I cry every time.  It is particularly heart wrenching now that June has passed...Everyone I know goes away in the end...how much more than one man take?<br />The other songs are good...and the album is superior...but I honestly listen to it for HURT.  This album is the crowning touch to a phenomenal career but HURT is the diamond in the crown...his whole life in one song.  People need to get over categorizations.  This is brilliant MUSIC, no matter what the genre.  This is a brilliant musician.  He does not have the best singing voice, but his vocals have more soul in them than ANYONE else out there now.  I would put him with Billie Holliday when it comes to singing from the very core of being.<br />Singers like Johnny come our way so infrequently...we need to hold on to him as long as we can.
B000002U9E|5.0|In 1982 Kate Bush released The Dreaming. The Dreaming did not do all that well with Fans or critics who either overlooked it or didn´t get it. The Dreaming was very dark and complex album with some hidden message although many today declare it her masterpiece it was not that crash hot upon it´s intial release over 20 years ago. Kate was not satisfied with the direction she was going. She did not like the producers she worked with and decided she would take a break from the business. She went do discover what she had desire for and built a 48 track studio and began working on writing and producing.The final outcome would become one of the greatest female recordings in Rock n Roll history.<br />Very different from her previous albums. Hounds Of Love is like something from a angent book. Lyrically it is provokative and daring and musically it is very diverse. It is beutiful , mysterious and sexy and though it is not your typical listen it is very accesible and maybe more so than any of her previous releases and even her subsequent ones. Partly a concept album. Bush takes you on a journey filled with all kinds of beautiful things. Overall this is a great album.<br />Released in september 1985 Kate Bush entered the UK chart at no.1 displacing Madonna´s Like A Virgin. Kate held the spot for 4 weeks and the album was also succesful in Europe. The LP was also her first top 40 LP in the US peaking at no.33. Many magazine hailed the album as fresh and innovative and declared Kate Bush one of the driving force in woman´s music. No argue about that. A classic album from an amazing artist. 5 stars.
B000069HKH|5.0|Supposedly born of the sad ashes of the Sept. 11 tragedy, there's a sense of joy that resonates from the music on \\"The Rising,\\" and hope from Bruce Springsteen's lyrics; \\"Lonesome Day\\" is one such song. There's an immediate pep to the music, but the words reveal a somewhat lost soul, someone looking for answers and hoping to move forward. \\"Into the Fire\\" has a homier sound, but its goal seems to be to inspire also: \\"May your strength give us strength, may your faith give us faith, may your hope give us hope, may your love bring us love,\\" sings Springsteen with soul and passion.<br /><br />Whereas many of Springsteen's songs over the years have focused on the down-and-out working man and woman (see [[ASIN:B0000025T6 Nebraska]] and [[ASIN:B0000025UW Born in the U.S.A.]]), this album is more about getting the most out of life joyously, while you still have the time. \\"Waiting on a Sunny Day\\" is pure feel-good pop, while \\"Let's Be Friends (Skin to Skin)\\" and \\"Mary's Place\\" have the same glad-to-be-alive vibe. \\"Mary's Place\\" has an especially retro Springsteen sound, similar to what he and the E Street Band were doing in the 1970s (see [[ASIN:B00000255F Born to Run]]). And while \\"Nothing Man\\" and \\"My City of Ruins\\" might not display such a breezy attitude toward life, there's still a glimmer of hope within each song, and that seemed to be the point of this CD: to inspire hope amid tragedy.<br /><br />Springsteen experiments with a Middle Eastern sound on \\"Worlds Apart,\\" a song that seems to make a commentary on the fundamentalist mentality in other part of the world versus a democratic, free one in the U.S. \\"Further On (Up the Road)\\" has a no-frills rock and roll sound, and it's a bit dark compared to many of these songs. \\"The Fuse\\" is equally as potent, and is one of my favorite songs on the album.<br /><br />It's hard not to hear the heartache and sincerity in Springsteen's voice on such songs as \\"You're Missing\\" and \\"Paradise,\\" and there's little doubt where such emotions stem from. Still, for every sad tune on the CD there's an upbeat, hopeful one like \\"The Rising,\\" which likely put some oomph back into many New Yorkers' steps when it came out. These are powerful tunes but also very accessible ones; many of them could have been released as radio singles, and it must have been difficult choosing which ones to select for that purpose.<br /><br />\\"My City of Ruins,\\" dedicated to New York City after the 9/11 attacks, was probably a tearjerker when it came out in 2002, and understandably so. The Boss, long known for his compassion, has never sounded so heartfelt, sad and personal, and he probably comforted many people by writing such a meaningful song and record.ll, for every sad tune on the CD there's an upbeat, hopeful one like \\"The Rising,\\" which likely put some oomph back into many New Yorkers' steps when it came out.

B000068PQ0|3.0|When I bought this album I was dissapointed. After hearing transmissions from the Satelite heart I was expecting another pure rock, energetic gem; this was not it. By no means is this a bad album, but given the previous performance and reccording of this band this fell below my expectations. The energy in this album is not as intense. There is not angst, very little anything, just a futuristic sort of narrative. The songs are excellently crafted, they have beautiful guitar and synthesizer, but they don't seem to say anything and are often repetitive or drowned out by drum machines. This album has its moments, but if you want a true gem, look no farther than Transmissions from the Sattelite Heart.

B000001FOS|5.0|I know...I'll probably get some criticism from other Yngwie fans for saying this, but this is truly one of my favorite Yngwie albums.  It has been criticized for being \\"too commercial\\", but personally, I love it!  This is the CD that introduced me to Yngwie and as soon as I heard \\"Dreamin\\", I was hooked.  It is one of the most beautiful songs I have ever heard, and solo on it will give you chills! After listening to this CD, I soon found myself looking to buy anything and everything that Yngwie ever recorded.  I now own most of his CD's, as well as those from his days with Steeler and Alcatrazz and I like just about all of them, but \\"Odyssey\\" is one that I find myself pulling out to listen to the most. I've heard it said that Yngwie plays without emotion, but I'll tell you what...if you can't hear the emotion on this CD, especially in \\"Dreamin\\" something's wrong with you!!! I don't see how anyone who really listens to Yngwie's music can say that he plays without emotion, because I can hear the passion with which he plays in nearly every song on this CD (as well as on others).  I've seen Yngwie in concert multiple times and there is nothing but passion in this man when he plays.  I think that people say that he plays without emotion only because he plays with such ease and such technical perfection. His fingers float so effortlessley across his fretboard that that I think his immense talent sometimes clouds the passion when he plays. In any case, Yngwie's talent is a true gift for all of us to enjoy and while this CD may be more commercial than some of his others, it contains some really great work.  For those of you that are not really into the super heavy guitar-shredding stuff, but who appreciate good guitar work and true talent, this CD and \\"Eclipse\\" would be good for you. This was a good introduction to Yngwie's work for me and I feel that it would be for others as well.  However, if you've never heard anything from Yngwie before and you want a true flavor of what Yngwie's all about, I think a good introduction with a little more variety would be to get his \\"Collection\\" CD. That being said, I think this is a great CD and Yngwie really shines in it.  He is, without a doubt, one of the world's greatest guitarists ever!
B0000025F7|4.0|I've bought this album and listened to it,and it's very nice,mellow,cool,down-to-earth side of Michael,that I like.At this time in his career he's trying to find his niche as a solo artist and he's a bit unsure,but he goes for it!And he and Quincy did a GOOD job.This is the Michael I like because I feel he was much more humble,sweet and innocent,plain,simple and cool!I liked the idea of him showing just his legs and shoes with the socks glowing.That was a cool,creative idea.I liked that look for the first album.It showed less showiness too.It gave it a interesting touch,like &quot;who is this guy,and what's he all about?&quot;Its just that (to me) he didn't seem like he was about and into being #1,he was just showing the world &quot;the young adult Michael Jackson,who is doing (or shall I say trying something out on his own).&quot;Cause see with &quot;Thriller&quot; (to me),he got big-headed!And turned into somebody else when fame hit him!(Though I do like that album alot).So I like &quot;Off The Wall&quot;,my favorite songs would have to be &quot;Off the Wall&quot;,and &quot;Rock with You&quot;.

I am going to throw it away......it's that bad.<BR>I have been a fan of King Crimson for many years and have truly enjoyed some of their earlier work.

Remember when they put out good music, such as Elephant Talk, Heartbeat, Three Of A Perfect Pair, Sleepless, etc.   <BR>But this,..... this is pure [garbage].  <BR>Don't even consider buying this.

B00005JLRT|5.0|This was the best TNG film made. Though this film is mostly dark as the crew of the enterprise ends its long run it still is the best Star Trek film to date.

B000002UVZ|5.0|This for me is R.E.M.'s peak. Before it they were a minor college band who had released a few albums of nice, albeit low-key, songs. Later they became hugely popular even though to me it sounded like they had run out of ideas a bit. But with this record they were great, they had mastered their metier and they were inspired. The music still sounds fresh and rocks in a way that no other R.E.M. record does.

I also wondered if they would ever get off the lifeboat.  I think the fact that you know from the beginning that the book is a happy ending causes the book to fail as a &quot;page-turner.&quot;  The book left me with such an uninterested feeling.  I couldn't wait to finish it just so I could stop dragging it around with me.  <br />I would not recommend this book nor would I suggest that it should win any more awards.  I gained little if anything from it.

B00000IQCF|5.0|Early Almodovar like MATADOR is more fun because the characters are so unique and outrageous. One thing remains consistent though with him over the years--his characters are all driven to extremes by desire(to the point of obsession). Matador is fun because even though the two lead characters share a dark desire (a sex-death urge) they are each so flamboyant like artists who seek to make their ultimate creative gesture. In Matador obsession is taken to an extreme which makes it exciting but also absurd and so comic. About the time of KIKA Almodovar began concentrating less on character and more on complicated plots, his characters still had dark desires but those desires no longer had the incorruptibility of obsession. KIKA was a schizophrenic film which wasn't enough fun to be a comedy and yet had too many absurd touches to be a film noir(though the last 20 minutes of that picture certainly was film noir). It was as if Kika was an awkward but necessary transition film and it felt like one. However with LIVE FLESH Almodovar has made a complete film noir from start to finish. Oddly enough it feels like this is the film he has been wanting to make for many years. It lacks the magic realism and passionate obsession that was so captivating and entertaining in a film  like Tie Me Up Tie Me Down and it also lacks stars that shine as bright but it more than makes up for it with a perfectly constructed plot. Live Flesh has what might be the most imaginative plot of any movie in recent years. It successfully presents a half dozen interconnected lives in a way that allows each one to fully come to life and each characters destiny is interrelated with every other characters destiny in a way that makes it one of the most complex narrative puzzles I have ever seen. Its complex piece of filmmaking which never makes a wrong move.  The plot makes it a noir but a very sophisticated noir. Desire as always is the driving force and obsession but this plot takes place not in the realm of art(as some of those earlier Almodovars did, which I still love)but in a more earthen realm. Almovodar gives this film a specific time frame, setting his plot firmly in reality. It begins in 1970 during a time of Fascist oppression in Spain. The main character is a victim of circumstance in every way. His mother was a prostitute and he was born on a bus and ends up losing his virginity with a drug addict who he bcomes instantly addicted to. When he makes a return visit to her apartment she rejects him, a fight breaks out, the cops arrive and someone is inadvertently or purposely shot. The plot never lets up. Desire comes to life and is betrayed in one scene after another. And yet  despite being a hard core noir with gritty realism(as opposed to Almodovars signature magic realism)this film ends with the realization of the main characters obsession. It is a long and dark and circuitous route to get there and yet there is light at the end of this winding labyrinth of desire. Highly recommended.

To think it took a a guy like him to master rap! His lyrics are amazing, offensive, and angry, that is why i must give him 5 stars
0385504209|5.0|Using the info found in Holy Blood, Holy Grail, and other Rennes-le-Chateau material (and taking the names Sauniere and Bezu for 2 of his main characters), Brown has crafted a Crichton-esque page-turner, that also balances our 1500+ (not 2000 as he points out) year patriarchal religious bent with a (it seems to me, more natural) goddess-worship view of religion.<br />Lots to learn (and the author doesn't invent it, type in &quot;Rennes-le-Chateau&quot; in Google for an eye-opener) while page-turning furiously (I read it on Metro escalators).<br />Far from coming across as &quot;atheistic&quot; or one-sided, Dan Brown presents a balanced, sympathetic view (maybe a tad condescending, coming from the perspective that the Grail material is in fact, true) of conventional Christian belief.

B00000K19E|2.0|If you're a big Sci-fi fan you might love this. I am not. I'm actually astounded by how many people took the time to write a review. I'm equally if not more astounded by how many felt compelled to give it 5 stars. To each his own, I guess. I saw this on a rainy Saturday and it was not my first choice. I can't even remember what we originally wanted to see but it was sold-out so we got stuck seeing \\"The Matrix\\". Anyway, I will give this film the two stars for its ground-breaking special effects. They were cool. That said, I cannot for the life of me understand what so many people find so fascinating about this film. I read some of the 5-star reviews and it never ceases to amaze me. I might possibly need to see this film again to try and get what everybody else did and what apparently went way over my head. I know there was a ton of existentialist, futuristic, mumbo-jumbo philosophizing going on and truth to tell I was bored out of my mind. I honestly couldn't wait for the closing credits. The film isn't even that well-directed and for something that is supposed to be a suspense film I couldn't have been more relaxed. I loved The Wachowski Brothers' first film \\"Bound\\". But as far as \\"The Matrix\\", one word: Feh.
B00008J2DQ|4.0|deffinitly their best since their self title debut album. There is a couple radio tunes on here, but the majority of it is very agressive and heavy. Riffs are catchy too. If you like Black Sabbath, alice in chains, nirvana, heavy grunge, you will liek this.
B00008PW3Q|3.0|I am an old Fleetwood Mac fan starting around the Kiln House era. <br />Say You Will is a good album but it has two flaws.  The first is the absence of Christine McVie.  Her sound, her songs, and her presence, were all vital parts of the Fleetwood Mac magic through numerous personnel changes. Of course the reasons given make sense, but I would love to hear what, if anything, Christine is up to musically these days, and what she would have contributed to this if she'd just done the studio gig without the touring.<br />The second flaw was, I expect, deliberate and so it's really an artistic judgment call, but I had high hopes that this album would include some of the wonderful lead vocal harmonies that Buckingham Nicks did so beautifully.  Instead this is like a Lindsey album and a Stevie album, with each other helping out and the FM rythym section.  For instance, &quot;Miranda&quot; is a great song, and it would have been so enhanced for Stevie to share more of the vocal and for the two of them to harmonize on some of the lead vocal parts.  That is true of at least half of the songs on the album.<br />Technically of course the album is very good.  The songs are good, even the older less-mature Stevie songs manage to fit in well with the new material.  FM without a keyboard is different and I think I like the overall sound less without significant keyboard parts.

B00005JKPF|5.0|I thought X2 was one of the best movies I've seen. Well, I might be slightly biased. I love the X-Men comics, I loved the first movie and I love Hugh Jackman. Anyway, I thought that this was the perfect sequel to the first movie. The first one was basically an introduction of concepts and characters. Setting the stage, so to speak. I am so glad they didn't reiterate issues in the second one to familiarize the audience with information covered in the first movie. It's definitely not a sequel that can be seen without seeing its predecessor. I loved everything about this movie. The special effects were awesome-especially Nightcrawler's \\"bamf\\" smoke. I loved the developement of Mystique's character- I always thought she was certainly Magneto's best ally- Sabretooth was a massive screwup who couldn't be trusted with the most simple of tasks. I don't think there's a single thing in the first movie that he did right. Anyway, Mystique got the job done time and again. Another character that I think was developed excellently in X2 was Jean Grey. In the first movie I sensed the depth to her character, her lack of self-esteem and frustration with Scott's overprotectiveness, but in X2 you could really see where her character was going. I can't wait to see her Phoenix persona in X3. Oh, and I thought Bruce Davison did a great job acting as Mystique acting as Senator Kelly. I loved the cameos by Colossus and Siren. Hope to see more of them in X3. Anyway, I think I've rambled on enough. In conclusion, I would definitely recommend this movie. Highly.
6304005490|5.0|The synopsis has been given so I'll just skip that on this review. Anyway, this is my favorite Doris Day &amp; Rock Hudson movie. The two have such wonderful chemistry. The movie was completely hilarious. I bought the video, but I wish that this movie was on dvd. I'd recommend it for any Rock Hudson &amp; Doris Day fans.

B000050FEN|5.0|Great movie. Too bad i saw it on T.V. I could tell they cut some scenes out. Some times it goes slow paced (like after the beginning, but really takes off near the end.) Great ending. Althought the T.V. version didn't really explain it good (stupid censorship) i understood it none the less. I write more if i could remember. I'd have to see this special edition
B000002H97|3.0|Without too much consideration to the actual material, it's with hindsight very clear what a big impact this release had on heavy metal. The production and the kind of guitar riffs and song structure used on this album was more ground breaking than I realised when the album was released back in 1991. Many people claim that Metallica sold out and became commercialized. I wouldn't agree, but on the other hand I have never been that much of a Metallica fan even `tho I have the musically much different \\"Kill `em all\\" (and like it). It is not unusual to hear songs from other bands that would have fit perfectly on Metallica's \\"Black album\\". Just listen to Virgin Steele's \\"Last supper\\" (from \\"The marriage of heaven and hell part 1\\" 1994), Blue yster Cult's \\"See you in black\\" (from \\"Heaven forbid\\" 1998), and Y&T's \\"Black gold\\" (from \\"Endangered species\\" 1997) among others and you'll probably discover the similarities. Even `tho I'm not particularly fond of the whole album I must admit that especially \\"Enter sandman\\" is good. \\"Sad but true\\" and a couple of other songs are quite attractive but the real value of this album is exactly like Deep Purple's \\"In rock\\" - namely for the approach. In that sense it's a milestone!
0790740443|3.0|excellent action movie, but falls too much under a basic \\"action movie\\" during the end. THe things that save this from being a Jean-Cluad Van Damme film are one, Kurt Russels expressions on his face( ANd the fact he BLINKS ONLY ONCE!) and the unique approach to the battlefield of tomorrow. THe beginning with the kids being shot and them witnissing boars being slaughtered is the genious of how paul anderson can make things disturbing (EVENT HORIZON).
B00004T9UF|4.0|'The Marshall Mathers LP' by Eminem is a great rap album and a must buy if you are a fan of the genre.While this album is very good,its not as entertaining,funny or as good as the 'Slim Shady LP'.This is the album that made Eminem really popular with massive album sales and chart topping hits.I still recomend you buy the 'Slim Shady LP'first though.That is by far his greatest album.
078322608X|5.0|A very good movie. I'd have to see it again to fully understand it ( I was 9 at the time) but never the less superior acting, especially Brad Pitt as the maniac. A thinking mans movie just like 2001 and Blade Runner, The director's cut. I don't know why i havent heard much about this movie before i saw it.

B00006JDVV|3.0|\\"Reign of Fire\\" (or I would like to call it more blatant \\"Humans vs Dragons\\") is directed by Rob Bowman, a guy behind the movie \\"X-Flies\\" and some of its TV episodes, and that would tell you something before you see the film.  No logical development of story can be found in the whole film, and you just cannot expect it from the start.<br />Before you watch the film, stop your thinking.  I tell you this because what you see first is the construction site in London for extending the subway line, and a boy is allowed to enter the tunnel, where a hollow cave is newly discovered.  I mean it, it's London, but it seems there have been no buildings or sewers around that place.  But you better forget that part anyway, and the film says a dragon ressurrects from the earth, and this unleashed fire-breathing creature destroys the whole world before you knew it.<br />The film then goes on depicting the humans living with meager food, hiding in a castle, fearing the attack of the dragons.  (Wait!  DragonS?  Sure, somehow the first one succeeded in reproducing the spieces, but I say, don't think.)  Christain Bale is Quinn, trusted leader of the people, but one day he meets an American troop led by Patton-like charismatic leader Van Zan played by overacting Matthew Mcconaughey.  (But how did they manage to fly over the Atlantic Ocean?)<br />Let's be honest.  The film's logic is too silly, and requires us to turn our blind eyes to the story.  The way the troopers fight the deadly dragons is displayed with certain amount of brio, but the details are so incredible that you have to keep on believing what you see on the screen (which is quite a task).  The CGIs are just OK, but somehow keeps you interested in the film, helped by fast speed of the story.       <br />Here I give you warning; the film's mid-size budget clearly didn't allow the crew to shoot some scenes, so if you think that the most intriguing part of the story is the mass destruction of the city, the country, or modern civilizations, you will be disappointed.  After the advent of the first dragon, the film just leaps to many years later, with an apologetically inserted subtitle \\"20 years later\\" and many newsmagazines' headlines like \\"Paris Burns!\\"  But unlike \\"Armageddon\\" we don't see that.<br />In a sense, \\"Reign of Fire\\" is kind of updated version of the 1950s type B-flicks in which humans desperately fight monsters.  There is nothing wrong with the formula if we see the film as such.  Unfortunately, our expectation level has risen since \\"Jurassic Park\\" so we want something more original in thetrical features.  Though the film is not bad, and it is good for spending some time on a rainy day, \\"Reign of Fire\\" just doesn't deliver anything new.
B00005T30L|5.0|I really liked this movie. I am a sucker for weirdness, and the characters in this movie are definite w-e-i-r-d. But in a good way! The main character, Enid, graduates from high school (well, almost. She has to take art class over again in summer school) with her best friend, Rebecca, and they need to figure out what they want to do with their post-high school selves. Enid amuses herself by playing a prank on an unassuming stranger, Seymour, and they end up becoming friends. Already distanced from the world around her, Enid begins distancing herself from Rebecca as well as the rest of her friends and family, none of whom she feels a deep emotional connection to.<br />Ghost World is based on the comic of the same name. Thora Birch plays Enid (in a wonderfully out-of-character role for her) and Scarlett Johansson plays Rebecca, the not-your-typical-blonde antisocial best friend. Steve Buscemi does a really great job as the dorky Seymour. You should see this movie for the interaction between the cast, if nothing else.
B0000024TT|5.0|The lilting poetry of Suzanne lures the listener into Leonard Cohen's world of romantic despair while introducing the essence of his sound: a deep monotone framed by sublime female backing vocals over simple but engaging melodies. Master Song, Winter Lady and Stranger Song reinforce the desolate landscape although the melodies are less immediate. Cohen's genius shines brightly on the immortal Sisters Of Mercy, a strange mixture of the spiritual and the sensual that must be one of the most beautiful song-poems in the English language. This delicate gem is followed by the powerful and evocative So Long Marianne and the understated Hey That's No Way To Say Goodbye, both masterpieces of words, melody and arrangement - the female vocals on Goodbye is especially impressive. Stories of the Street appears as a poem in one of Cohen's 1960s poetry books and deals with a visit to Havana during of just after the revolution. Interesting fact: The line \\"some girls wander by mistake\\" from Teachers was later used as an album title by the goth band Sisters Of Mercy. One Us Cannot Be Wrong addresses the beloved in a series of strange images before moving on to melodic whistling and ending with bitter shouted la la lahs. For those interested in other artists' take on Cohen: Suzanne has been beautifully covered by inter alia Judy Collins and Geoffrey Oryema, while Sting and the Chieftains' celtic version of Sisters Of Mercy is available on the Tower Of Song tribute album. On the I'm Your Fan tribute there are interesting interpretations of Hey That's No Way To Say Goodbye by Ian McCulloch, Stories Of The Street by That Petrol Emotion and So Long Marianne by James.
0385504209|5.0|I'm not sure what's got everyone so riled up about this book: perhaps it's the multitude of conspiracy theories that come together to make this story work? Maybe it's the potentially offensive character who kills in the name of the Catholic Church? I think it's a combination of the two.<br />The book is based in truth - Brown did his research on the subjects of art, cryptography, and secret societies. But from there, he takes off in an imaginative and exciting direction, weaving a first-class story about art, history, murder, conspiracy theories, and secret societies. His protagonist, a symbologist named Robert Langdon, is trying to find out why a great art historian and curator at the Louvre has been murdered, and why he has been thrown together with the man's granddaughter by chance. Or has it been planned all along?<br />Computer scientists, historians, and anyone with an open mind (remember, this is fiction, despite the strong factual base the story is built upon) will enjoy the twists, turns, puzzles, and intelligence involved in The DaVinci Code. It's a fast read, the characters are interesting, and the plot is absolutely stunning in its originality. Some earlier reviews mentioned awkward prose throughout the book, but it seems to me that that's just how certain characters speak. Internal thoughts and the author's vivid descriptions flow more gracefully than the sometimes stilted speech of some characters, but it wasn't a major issue. I certainly wasn't stumbling over it as I read.<br />The pace of this book speeds up more and more until you get to the end and just can't put it down. This was the first e-book I bought for my pocketPC, and I'm glad I got it. I was reading it at every possible moment: in the car, on the bus, while cooking dinner. Though the beginning is very low-key, giving background on characters, history, and facts, you get sucked in quickly, and by the end, you find yourself staying up until the wee hours of the morning trying to read as much as you can. The online web quest that accompanies the book is highly recommended, too. Visit Dan Brown's web site to check it out - I'm glad this author has thought of his readers to such an extent that he's willing to create something like that for us to have fun with.h as you can.

0345457684|5.0|I think, if you take Bruce Willis in Die Hard, advance him about 300 or so years in the future, update his weaponry, and replace the dialog and style with a more Quentin Tarintino-esq approach, you begin to get a sense for Morgan's Altered Carbon.   It's a furious violent read; gritty and intensly visual. <br />As darkly humorous as it is, it is clear Morgan is a serious writer capable of any genre, and I'm very excited to read new installments.  Highly recommended.

B000002L68|5.0|If I were stranded on a desert island and could only have 5 cd's, I would be hard pressed not to include this one in the group.  I believe this is the definitive work of Prince and truly represents that magical time in the 80's where music came alive for the first time via MTV !!  Really good music creates a feeling that transcends words....you simply want to share it with others and let them enjoy it with you.  Purple Rain does that for me (and I'm sure for many of you).  Prince is a master \\"Ar'Teest\\".....killer guitar licks, haunting keyboards and lyrics....whoa....this guy taps into a place \\"we all know\\" but few can put into words !!  Love, sex, relationships, defeat, redemption.....Purple Rain touches it all.  Its life captured on a glitsy set we can all see in our minds....and our hands all go up in the air...swaying back and forth...mezmerized !!  And let's not forget THE REVOLUTION...his best backing band ever....it all just clicked !!  Songs like \\"Beautiful Ones\\", \\"Doves Fly\\", \\"Die 4 U\\", \\"Nikki\\" and of course \\"Purple Rain\\"....are all indelible marks on the fabric of America....That's great music !!
0805062971|5.0|This is a story that is deeply philosophical in nature regarding the events and the introspections of the character, however this mixed with the disturbing psychological ongoings makes for a fantastic read that is interesting, brilliantly articulated philosophy and distrubingly captivating psychosis.
B00006LI4S|1.0|I've loved Pink Floyd for years but don't expect to find anything but a very weak cry from the past on this DVD.  I give it one star because Gilmour showed up but, beyond that, I can't think of anything redeeming to say about this DVD.  If you're looking for Pink Floyd or even the David Gilmour of days gone by, you'll be sorely disappointed by this recording.
B00008H2LE|2.0|Hybrid Theory got the formula very close to right; every song on it is good in some way. Though Reanimation had some very strong points, it overall tipped the balance far too heavily toward rap. But if Reanimation heavily overdosed on rap, then Meteora suffers from a lethal case of heavy metal poisoning. The unique and brilliant melodies and lyrics of Hybrid Theory have been almost comletely abandoned in favor of screaming poor lyrics to the tune of noise that can't pass for real music. A good 2/3 of the songs on Meteora have the exact same theme: the desire to become less like another person and more like oneself. This is extremely ironic, since LP now sounds less like themselves and more like all the horrible rap/rock groups out there (Korn, Limp Bizkit, etc.). Meteora has some gems, but I don't think LP will ever produce another song as haunting as \\"In The End\\".<br />This album has a peculiar quirk. There is only one good track in the first 8, and only one truly bad track in the remaining five. The first of the remaining five is very appropriately titled \\"Breaking the Habit,\\" and is an awesome example of what this album should have been. It is one of the two best songs on the album, the other being \\"Numb,\\" which is very much like Hybrid Theory's \\"Runaway,\\" except with consistently better music and much less creative lyrics (yes, it's one of those \\"more like me, less like you\\" songs)<br />The first single from this album, \\"Somewhere I Belong,\\" is far from the best. It is easily beaten by \\"Session,\\" \\"Breaking the Habit,\\" \\"From the Inside,\\" and \\"Numb,\\" and just barely beaten by \\"Easier to Run\\" (the one good track in the first 8)and \\"Foreword\\" (the thirteen seconds of rain and breaking glass that preceed the actual songs). \\"Somewhere I Belong\\" started out as a really cool sampling, but it went horribly wrong somewhere during the production phase. The chorus sounds like it has nowhere to go but wants to get there very badly, and the rap verses are mediocre. The background sampling that started this song should have been given much better treatment. The same applies to the japanese flutes that LP used for the one bad song in the last five tracks; there was so much potential, but they turned it into a bad remake of High Voltage.<br />The bonus DVD is pretty interesting. It is the only real reason for actually buying this album ... It also explains why the album's cover shows a guy with a gas mask and can of spraypaint.<br />A brief review of each track:<br />1 - \\"Foreword\\" It's not often that an album is kicked off by a bunch of random sound effects that are given their own track. Kind of cool.<br />2 - Filler and a disgrace to LP<br />3 - \\"Somewhere I Belong\\" I explained this track in detail previously in the review.<br />4 - Filler and a disgrace to LP<br />5 - Filler and a disgrace to LP<br />6 - \\"Easier to Run,\\" a song that otherwise would have been filler and a disgrace to LP, is just barely saved by quite possibly the best rap verses I've ever heard.<br />7 - Filler and a disgrace to LP<br />8 - Filler and a disgrace to LP<br />9 - \\"Breaking the Habit\\" breaks the habit of bad tracks that all sound the same and proves that Meteora wasn't a complete waste of money after all. It is all singing and no rap, all melody and no noise, an upbeat yet soulful confession that the singer doesn't know why he's such a horrible person, but he knows it's not alright and wants to change. Absolutely beautiful.<br />10 - \\"From the Inside\\" Another excellent song with verses that beautifully mix Chester's singing with Mike's rapping, and choruses that sound epic and sweeping. The refrain could have been a lot better, though.<br />11 - This is the track that turned the excellent idea of using japanese flutes and became a bad remake of High Voltage - and High Voltage was pretty bad to begin with.<br />12 - \\"Session\\" While Hybrid Theory's instrumental track was made by Mr. Hahn, Meteora's instrumental track is made by Mike Shinoda. It's a bit darker, less funky, and more consistent than Mr. Hahn's work, though it has the same scratchy, catchy style.<br />13 - \\"Numb\\" is anything but its namesake. All the musical brilliance of \\"Breaking the Habit,\\" the beautiful mix of singing and rap similar to \\"From the Inside,\\" and all the raw emotion that Chester can muster for the chorus come together with the electric guitars set to full blare. This song rocks through and through in every way, if you can forgive the fact that its lyrics are the same ones used for 2/3 of the other songs on the album., less funky, and more consistent than Mr. Hahn's work, though it has the same scratchy, catchy style.<br />13 - \\"Numb\\" is anything but its namesake.

0316666343|4.0|With a writing style that is not overly sophisticated, nor is it overly pretentious, this touching story about life, love, family, and letting go is certainly worth picking up.  I breezed through it in just a few days, and though the last few chapters left me wondering &quot;where did that come from,&quot; I still thoroughly enjoyed it.  A little hokey at times, this easy read takes you through a girl's personal heaven and presents the notion that each of us has the ability to spend eternity in our own personal heavens.  The author does a fabulous job weaving you through the lives of each character - leading you to tears in one chapter, ultimate rage in another, and finishing you off with a sense of closure.  Pull up a seat next to a window on a warm summer day, read this book, watch children play in the street, and revel in the thought that sometimes, days don't get any better than this.
B000002GF8|4.0|_Synchronicty_ showcases a very 'bright' side of The Police, as well as the more melancholy side that Sting would go on to develop as a solo artist.<br />Everyone is familiar with the strong set of hits from this album - &quot;Every Breath You Take,&quot; &quot;King of Pain,&quot; &amp; &quot;Wrapped Around Your Finger&quot; - all great 80s pop rock.  However, the best cuts on the album are &quot;O My God&quot; - a funky song that features a typically catchy bassline from Sting - and &quot;Tea in the Sahara,&quot; a lush arrangement wrapped around one of Sting's best vocal performances on a Police album.  Other high points is the apocolyptic tinge of &quot;Syncrhonicity II,&quot; and the bouncy Stewart Copeland-penned &quot;Miss Gradenko.&quot;  Andy Summers' &quot;Mother&quot; often gets passed off as 'unlistenable,' but it's a goofy song that The Police have always really done in some way or another (assorted b-sides, &quot;Be My Girl&quot; from _Outlandos D' Amour_, &quot;On Any Other Day&quot; from _Regatta De Blanc_, etc.).<br />Few hardcore Police fans seem to think this is their best album, but, like all albums by The Police, they are ALL worth owning if you're a fan.

0312305060|3.0|I had never read a Pulitzer winning book before I picked up The Hours, and - I tell ya - I've read better.  Much better.  <br />The story was well written enough.  I liked the links between the three women; Virginia Woolf writing her classic Mrs. Dalloway, Clarissa (Mrs. Dalloway) getting ready for her party and Laura Brown - reading the novel in the fifties.  I liked how Cunningham mirrored Virgina's thought processes in constructing Mrs. Dalloway, with what was happening in Clarissa's day.  <br />Technically - I can't find fault with the book.  It is just that it lacks.. that certain something.  The x-factor.  The bit that kept me from holing myself up in my bedroom frantically turning pages, biting my nails to see what happened next.  It just wasn't there.  It lacked engagement.  <br />Maybe the movie is better, who knows?

B00006879E|5.0|I first was drawn to this band by the video for &quot;Harder To Breathe&quot; on the former much music.  The vocals and the funky beat to the song drew me in and the cd itself is incredible.  From the slower song &quot;She Will Be Loved&quot; with its great lyrics to &quot;Shiver&quot; this cd won't dissapoint.  With a  great and different sound like very few bands Maroon 5 is destined for stardom.  This cd is a must buy.
B00005JKBC|5.0|This is a very suspenseful movie, despite the times where the viewer is quite capable of predicting what will happen in the following scene. The storyline is interesting, and the reconstruction of war torn lebanon, is a quite accurate depiction of what the atmosphere was like during that period of civil unrest. Nevertheless, there was one flaw in one of the scenes. The scene where Robert Redford, Brad Pitt, and his lady friend are in a bar. The music playing in the background, an arabic song, Nour El Shams, is a contemporary song, yet for some odd reason, it seems to have been played in a time, which was way back when. This song didn't even exist, neither did the singer sing, so why was it being played? Who knows?! Nonetheless, a great movie that is enjoyable to watch.
B000089A07|2.0|I suppose if I saw this film without having first seen Manhunter, I likely would be giving it a better rating. But I did see Manhunter and it is legions better than Red Dragon.  William Peterson (now of CSI fame) played Will in Manhunter and, compared to Edward Norton, he is just more believable as a seasoned FBI agent who has been psychologically and emotionally damaged by his work. I also felt Harvey Keitel (whom I normally like) was stiff here.  Ralph Fiennes was alright, but  his depiction just fell short of Tom Noonan in the original. I so BELIEVED Noonan's portrayal, if only because he is so freaky looking to begin with. Also, he was a virtual unknown in 1986, and is still not well known now. I challenge anyone to compare two scenes in particular: The first is when the killer has kidnapped the reporter and shows him the slide show. Noonan is much more menacing, scary, and believable. The second, is when he takes the blind girl to see the tiger. In Red Dragon, the girl pets the tiger and listens to his heart through a stethascope. In Manhunter, she runs her fingers through the tiger's plush coat, very sensuously, and presses her head to its body. Then she puts her hand in the tiger's mouth and fondles his menacing canine tooth. That's edgy, erotic, dangerous. And superior.  To the other reviewer who notes that several of the lines could have been taken directly from Psycho, he's right.  In fact, both Psycho and Manhunter/Red Dragon (as well as Buffalo Bill in Silence of the Lambs)  are based largely on the crimes of serial killer Ed Gein, who murdered women for their skin.  He wanted to become his mother and he liked to dance naked beneath the moonlight draped in their bloody skins.  When Gein was caught, it was said that they discovered he had made lampshades out of human flesh.  Bottom line: Manhunter is the better film. See it before you watch Red Dragon.
0385507755|5.0|Despite the other less than glowing reviews, I loved this book. It kept me reading and what's more, and what is, to me, the mark of a good book, it kept me thinking about the main character when I wasn't reading it. Is it predictable? Somewhat, but the writing is fresh and incredibly, and sometimes brutally, honest. Frey has an arrogant, holier than thou persona, especially at the end, but I cheer his integrity in the face of so much self-help garbage that is out there. As a memior, it is lacking a reason for the addiction, but that is his main point: he is not a victim of anyone; only he made the choices that he made. If nothing else, this reasoning is refreshing and a great topic for discussion. Are addicts products of their families or is this a cop-out excuse? As for a predictable ending, yes and no--if you can, wait until the end and read about what happens to each of the characters. This is no fairy tale conclusion. Overall, even though I did find him self-aggrandizing, I thoroughly enjoyed the read.
B00004Y9PP|2.0|I sat down ready to watch what I had hoped would be a great sci-fi action film. I expected another movie to give the 'Alien' series a run for it's money. I feel like I wasted my time. I want it back. I feel like the producers of this film pulled a fast one on me.<br />The film follows a group of people on a starship who crashland on a remote planet. One character, Vin Diesel's Riddick, is an escaped convict heading back to prison having just been recaptured. As the group search the area around the crashsite, the find that the planet's three suns are going to set, and they will be plunged into total darkness. In this darkness lies a terror worse than Riddick. Blah, blah, blah...<br />We all know the hype. The commercials were good and the special effects look good. Honestly, three-quarters of the way into this movie, I was enjoying it. There were several plot twists that were totally unexpected, and fairly refreshing, until toward the end of the film. One plot twist too many, and the movie lost me as a fan. I felt cheated, or better yet, tricked.<br />Diesel does a good job with the acting in this movie. The special effects were fantastic, and the creatures were pretty scary. Not as nightmare-inducing as the alien, but still a bit scary. <br />They say that two things can make or break a movie. These being the beginning and the ending. The movie had a solid beginning, but alas, a poor ending.

Most of the serious roles he plays (Dead Poets Society, Awakenings, and Patch Adams, for example) leave me feeling like I am constantly being preached to by some smug righteous know-it-all who has a simple answer for everything.  The only opposition the protagonist gets is from the stuffed-shirt Establishment (boo hiss) which serves as a straw man that can be knocked down with ease.<br />However, I find it just to be more insulting to my intelligence, not to mention lacking in basic humor.  Patch's wacky antics are the sort of stunts I would expect from my 9-year-old, not a doctor who is presumably trying to treat my ailments.<br />Certainly, none of us appreciates being treated in a sterile impersonal manner, but I personally would prefer a doctor who doesn't appear to be a complete jackass.  Studies have certainly shown that patients respond positively to being treated with warmth & compassion, but other studies have shown as well that patients like to see that white lab coat, because it conveys an air of authority and competence that patients find reassuring.<br />Of course the movie completely ignores these complicated issues, because the director is more interested in cranking out a formulaic, paint-by-the-numbers, feel-good Hollywood piece.  It is far easier to resort to manipulating your audience with hackneyed plot devices and clich&eacute;s than try to address serious issues intelligently.  Make sure to claim that it is a true story as well.  The fact that this movie won the Best Picture Golden Globe is further evidence that all of these awards shows are utterly worthless when it comes to judging the true merits of a film.
B00000K19E|5.0|\\"The Matrix is the world that has been pulled over your eyes to blind you from the truth.\\"<BR>\\"What truth?\\"<BR>That \\"The Matrix\\" is a brilliant film. You put in the DVD, and immediately you are confronted with a fast moving montage of the best bits of the movie. You could sit and watch the menu for two hours, or you could watch the film. What I thought before watching the movie was that it was just another sci-fi movie with nothing I hadn't seen before. I was wrong. Very, very wrong.<br />The beginning is a bit slow moving, but you need to hang in there to fully appreciate the rest of the film.<BR>The film follows the story of Thomas A. Anderson or his hacker alias Neo. He is just like you or me until he is contacted by Morpheus. He explains to Neo how where he lives is actually a computer generated dream world sent into our brains by machines who need our energy to survive. The Matrix is that dream world. Neo is apparently able to remake the Matrix as he sees fit, and the movie is about how he discovers his abilities.<BR>Neo is played by Keanu Reeves, who spent four months learning kung fu for the movie. It really does make for great viewing.<BR>But what stands out the most are the amazing special effects. I'm talking about bullet time. The camera spins around Neo as he dodges bullets in super slow motion. The explosions, the camera effects as the camera zooms through computer screens, allowing us to see inside the screen, it's all amazing.<BR>Another dimension to the film is the score, by Don Davis. It is great by itself but adds mood and mysteriousness to the movie. Also, the soundtrack is great, from Rage Against The Machine (The end of the film where Neo hangs up the phone) to the Propellerheads (The shoot-out scene in the lobby of the Government building). <br />So the film is breathtaking, but it doesn't stop there. Back in 1999, the release of the DVD transformed how DVDs were to be made. It had tons of special features, hidden special effects documentaries,and a great DVD-ROM feature that allowed you to access interviews, games, exclusive websites and more. Even today it rises above many other DVDs in terms of special features. And if that isn't enough, a double disc DVD is available with even more features.<BR>The film is rated 15, but there isn't really anything there that's too bad for older children. If anything, it appeals more to younger people.<BR>So if you're thinking of buying this DVD, there's no point in thinking about it. Go ahead and buy it. It is a film that gets better every time you watch it, and you will need to watch it again to notice everything in the film. It is essential to anyone's DVD collection.<BR>\\"Why do my eyes hurt?\\"<BR>\\"You've never used them before...\\"
B00008PW3Q|3.0|Fleetwood Mac's first studio album in sixteen years with Lindsey Buckingham on board has several problems.  _Say You Will_'s major problem is the same problem with many albums released in the past decade - it's just TOO long.  There's 18 songs here clocking in at over 70 minutes.  Six or seven of these songs could've been left off, and you'd have a much stronger album.  Regardless of the several songs on this album that would've seemed better suited on a Lindsey Buckingham solo album, there still is a good amount of strong songs.  <br />The album starts off in a suprisingly dull manner.  &quot;What's the World Coming To,&quot; is pleasant, but not much more.  Other Buckingham tracks like &quot;Murrow Turning Over in His Grave&quot; and &quot;Come&quot; feature as-always amazing guitar work, but the songs themselves are unmemorable.  That applies for most of the Buckingham songs, as it appears that this album is simply some of his songs and some Stevie Nicks songs with John McVie and Mick Fleetwood accompanying rather than a FULL group effort.  It really doesn't kick into classic commercial (75-87) Fleetwood Mac mode until the 7th song, &quot;Say You Will.&quot;  &quot;Peacekeeper&quot; continues in this same fashion and from there the album picks up steam.  &quot;Running Through The Garden&quot; finally features Buckingham and Nicks singing together in the passionate style that they recaptured on _The Dance_.  &quot;Silver Girl&quot; also captures the gentle, immaculate pop that Fleetwood Mac and Stevie Nicks crafted in the 80s.  &quot;Bleed to Love Her&quot; (first heard on _The Dance_; the bridge of the song actually first heard on Buckingham's _Out of the Cradle_) is wisely included here as it is arguably the strongest cut on the album.  <br />Having listened to the album a few times now, I think _Say You Will_ surely would've benefitted from cutting a few songs.  While even if the good songs on this album may not match the best of what Fleetwood Mac has done inthe past, they are still good songs on their own terms.  The treatment of Nicks' songs on this album definitely sound better than her solo material from the 90s.  However, the indulgent tendencies of Buckingham without the opportunity of being offset by Christine McVie's earthier nature does weigh down the album a bit.  Hardly their best work as a group, _Say You Will_ should please longtime fans and especially fans of Nicks' solo albums.
B00005JLRT|5.0|I really love Nemesis and am still surprised at the negative reaction by so many.  It was truly a great movie for anyone. The story is brilliant with lots of surprises and twists.  I think one of the only problems of the film is that the director made many poor choices in cutting out many good scenes that would have made the movie even better. There are much talked about scenes that were cut that gave closure to the characters, like Doctor Crusher who really does not do very much and disappears for a good part of the end battle.  I still love Nemesis despite the directors many poor choices of action over closure, at least we all know that those scenes are out there waiting to be put back in the movie to make fans happy. Hopefully some time we will see a special director's edition of Nemesis like what has been done with the Motion Picture and Wrath of Khan and have more scenes added.  <BR>The Special features are fairly good.  The deleted scenes that are included are great and should have been added to the actual film.  The deleted scenes are unfinished, so they are a bit fuzzy and we see green screen out the windows instead of stars. The director said the scene of Shinzon's original introduction in the senate had to be cut because we saw his face before it was shadowed when he meets Picard. There would have been an easy way to get around that and keep that good scene by just having the senate darker to hide Shinzon's face in that scene.  Again, they just did not have the right director for this one.   <BR> The cast interviews included are good, however we hear them discussing getting more to do and having closure to their characters which most of those scenes they were happy about when the interviews were done were cut out.  <BR>The interviews and audio commentary with the director are not that great because he pretty much praises all of the work he did and the obviously bad choices he made in what to keep and cut.  Even non-major Trek fans will realize that the director does not exacltly know what he is talking about when discussing the Star Trek Universe.  Baird just does not understand that fans prefer character development.  <BR>Overall it was a good movie that just had some bad decisions made on the cutting room floor.  So we can all hope some day to have a Special edition made that will give the right dues to the movie especially if it was the last TNG film.
0451527046|5.0|\\"Treasure Island\\" is the classic adventure novel by Robert Louis Stevenson. Set on the high seas amid treasures and pirates, it is the story of a young boy's adventure. \\"Treasure Island\\" has been done by everyone from Disney to the Muppets. It's been imitated many times and influenced countless books and movies.<br />A mysterious pirate shows up at an inn owned by Jim Hawkin's mother. The pirate is killed by a gang of rogues, but Jim finds a treasure map belonging to the pirate. Jim then embarks on a journey to far away island to find the treasure. Of course, nobody can be trusted - especially the cook, Long John Silver. With his peg leg and parrot, Silver is the stereotypical pirate. Once the island is reached, sides are chosen - the mutinous pirates against the ship's crew. Jim goes on a journey within a journey on the island, going from one side to another, as the treasure is hunted for.<br />Everyone should read this book at some point. It's especially good for young boys, due to the fact that the main character (Jim) is a young boy. It's well crafted, and easy to read. And it's hard to put down once you get going. What else can you ask for?
B00005KFUM|5.0|Muse are by far one of the best bands EVER! I have this album and can tell that it, honestly, ROCKS! If anyone is sad in enough to disagree then I will happily take them in a fight unless they are a pro fighter bloke/blokette.I also reccommend that, if you are a Muse FAN like ME you have to take the deal on Origin Of Symmetry + Showbiz for $$ because Showbiz ROCKS too. I am Sorry For all the capitals but I had a bottle of Pepsi Max.tm. and feel very HYPER right now. But, even when I'm not I HYPER I still think MUSE ROCK TO ALL INFINITY AND BEYOND. So just buy all their albums, get HYPER from Pepsi Max.tm. and go INSANE!!LA LA LA LA. Oh, and get onto [...] and find out about their TOURS and MERCHANDISE and SONGS (if you don't know much about MUSE,like you wouldn't, they ROCK!)
B00006BTCA|2.0|interpol, this year's newest rock magazine favorite are, what i find to be nothing more than victims of hype.<br />joy division comparisons aside, interpol still manages to take unoriginality to a new level. as other negative reviewers have said before; if you paid attention to early 80s post punk at all, you might as well skip this one. for those who missed it the first time, and dont mind a lesser facimile, then this might be a decent introduction. <br />one of my biggest complaints here is that often parts of songs are lifted straight from the very bands whos influence they wear on their sleeves. &quot;say hello to the angels&quot; their newest single, has an uncanny resemblance to 1984's &quot;this charming man&quot; by a manchester band whos name im sure you all already know. the quirky yet strong rhythm and guitar riffs could come from no other place but the smiths' classic single. I found this happen on more than this occasion on the actual disc, but i find that playing a musical guessing game with &quot;turn on the bright lights&quot; is an enlightening experience that all should have the pleasure of.
B0000399WC|5.0|This is one of the best movies that I have ever seen. Dustin Hoffman's Best, in my opinion. An absolute classic, which should be part of any collection.
B000059HAI|4.0|Following in the tradition of Darryl F. Zanuck's The Longest Day (which I erroneously said was the top draw of 1963; it was the second, actually), 20th Century Fox embarked on a risky venture: to tell the true story of Pearl Harbor. To do so, they chose the same style of international cooperative effort that had paid off so well for Zanuck and Fox in 1962: to use foreign (in this case, Japanese) and American directors and cast members.<br />Unlike The Longest Day, however, where most, if not all of the shooting was done in French studios and locations, Tora! Tora! Tora! would be shot on both sides of the Pacific, with a team of Japanese directors - who had replaced a difficult Akira Kurosawa - filming the Japanese sequences, and Richard Fleischer and his team helming the American sequences. The directorial credits would differ depending on which side of the Pacific the movie was released. In Japanese theaters, Toshio Oguni and Kinji Fukasuka got the directorial credit, while in the U.S. Richard Fleischer was the director. Since Fox was the releasing studio, the footage from Japan was integrated into Fleischer's Hawaiian and Washington footage under the American director's supervision at Fox studios in California.<br />Unlike 2001's popular yet fanciful \\"Pearl Harbor\\", this motion picture is as historically accurate as Hollywood (and its Japanese collaborators) could manage. And while history buffs may say the movie skips incidents integral to the Pearl Harbor story (such as the Japanese espionage efforts on Oahu, for instance), Tora! Tora! Tora! is a good introduction to the fascinating and very complex subject of how and why Japan struck on December 7, 1941. It also shows why America was caught unprepared even though war with Japan seemed inevitable.<br />Even though special effects now are far better than in 1969 (when this 1970 film was made), the movie's visuals have more punch than Michael Bay's fictitious version of the Day of Infamy. Even though there are a lot of miniature effects used, especially in the 30 minute sequence depicting the attack on Pearl Harbor, the use of real planes and locations give the audience a realistic version of the Japanese assault. Real planes are used whenever possible, and even the fake Zero fighters (in reality modified T-28 Texans made to look like Mitsubishi's Zeros) are more convincing than ILM's computer generated ones in \\"Pearl Harbor.\\"<br />Like The Longest Day before it, Tora! Tora! Tora! tries to accurately recreate historical events as faithfully as possible. The buildup to the Day of Infamy covers almost 18 months' worth of events. Starting with Japan's alliance with Nazi Germany and Fascist Italy and the growing strain in U.S.-Japanese relations, there are many scenes dealing with politics, intelligence gathering, failed diplomacy, and, finally, war. Because of this, and because in many cases the dialog has appeared in non-fiction history books, the acting of the great character actors seems to some a bit stiff and unnatural. But that should not deter new viewers from watching this movie.<br />A word of caution. This movie does not adhere to the FDR-knew-about-the-attack-and-allowed-it-to-happen revisionist theory. Most responsible historians reject it as nonsense. If viewers are looking for this pernicious and acrimonious version of the Pearl Harbor tragedy, then this movie is not for them.<br />As for the DVD: released almost at the same time as Michael Bay's 2001 movie, Tora! Tora! Tora! was given a new attractive package, and taking advantage of the DVD technology, restored to its original widescreen format. I had owned the VHS version for 12 years before I bought the DVD, and there is no comparison between the videotape's pan and scan \\"full screen\\" view and widescreen....I don't understand why anyone still likes full screen versions of movies that were shot on Cinema Scope or Panavision widescreen. The director's commentary is good and informative, the sound (Dolby Surround) is excellent, and the picture is sharp and clear. The theatrical trailer and a 20-minute documentary, Day of Infamy, are also included.<br />This is a DVD any serious history or war movie buff should have in his or her video library.) is excellent, and the picture is sharp and clear.

0066214122|3.0|This was the first novel I read by Crichton and overall it was pretty good.  The concept of nanotechnology is very interesting.  I have also read By Light of the Moon by Dean Koontz which dealt with nanotechnology but in a different way.  The major complaint I had was with the whole focus on the narrator's family life.  Although it played a role in the plot, I felt it went too deep into it and took away from the story.  Also, the I didn't like the way the author portrayed the kids.  The kid's behavior didn't seem real life, the name calling was something an adult might imagine children saying to each but in reality don't.  And after awhile it just got annoying reading about them.  I gave it three stars because of the idea and also the second half of the novel was better than the first half.
0060987464|5.0|The book that Marilyn Manson wrote was great. It honestly showed his life in his perspective and not journalists. If you are a Marilyn Manson fan, this book is most definitely a \\"must have\\". This book should also be for people who are not too fond of him. For it will make you look at Marilyn Manson in a different angel, and not the evil man the media has portrayed him to be. Overall a great book and one that I will recommend to anyone...
0712623884|5.0|This is definitely an interesting book. It views the 'luck' from a scientific perspective. By having 4 simple principles, everyone can increase the chance of luck. In fact, Dr. Wiseman demonstrates the people with luck having a common set of personalities that lead them to have more opportunities than others. Luck is not from your psychic power, it's more the consequence of how you behave and how you view your daily life.<BR>This book is similar to the &quot;Millionaire Mind&quot; by Dr. Thomas Stanley, which depicts the characteristic of being a millionaire. To be a better luck person, it's simple, just be more positive and using Dr. Wiseman's four principles.
0316666343|5.0|The Lovely Bones is a rare book in that it simultaneously examines the murder of a young girl on two separate planes: from the detached viewpoint of heaven and the emotional devastation on earth.  I found myself reacting to the novel both as a reader, admiring Ms. Sebold's lovely writing and insight, and as a parent, imagining myself in the horrible position of the father in the novel.   <br />The result of my identification with the father, even though I have been fortunate enough never to have lost a child, made me feel surprisingly angry at the way that I perceived that the father was being treated in the novel by the wife's character.  Only after getting away from the book did I come to understand that my identification and reaction came from the excellence of the novel's character portrayals.  Although I have been done with the book for about two weeks, I still find myself thinking about the book and about the characters in it.  <br />This book is an emotional tour through landscapes both the strange and disturbingly familiar.  An extremely effective effective and affecting novel.
B0000931OG|5.0|Compared to Blur's other CDs, this one has taken on a new twist, with a little darker side. However, when listened to closely, it's still the same good ol' Blur, just taking a new path. Think Tank features wild, Song 2-esque &quot;We've Got a File on You&quot; and &quot;Crazy Beat&quot;, eerie ones, like &quot;Jets&quot;, as well as the more mellow &quot;Out of Time&quot;, &quot;Sweet Song&quot;, and &quot;Battery in Your Leg&quot;. Damon Albarn's growing outspokeness about politics somewhat influences the album, adding that extra touch, when you aren't sure if a song is talking about society or a personal experience. When first listening to it, I didn't enjoy the album because all the songs seemed morbid and gloomy. However, after listening to it again, I found this to be yet another masterpiece created by Blur.
0156027321|5.0|A plot outline of Life of Pi would make it sound as if there could be no way that the novel could be serious or contemplative.  After all, the primary plot of the book concerns a teen-ager's voyage across the Pacific Ocean in a lifeboat with a 450 lb Bengal Tiger.  Nevertheless, Life of Pi is so well-written that the novel almost feels documentary.  <br />Yann Martel takes great pains in the first section of the book to provide the reader with the information necessary to believe that the main character would understand a great deal about animal behavior.  Consequently, when Pi is stranded on the lifeboat with the various animals, his reactions to them and consequent actions because of them, do not come out of left field, but seen it knowledgeable, informed, and plausible.  <br />The character of Pi himself is one of the great creations of modern fiction.  Here is a boy who is capable of grasping not only the knowledge of the animal behavior imparted to him by his zookeeper father, but also is capable of profound meditation on the on the universe, the existence of God, and the joy to be derived from participation in the various religions that existed in his tiny corner of India.  <br />It is certainly possible to read this novel as a great adventure yarn without having to deal with the more metaphysical issues that the book raises.  Yes the issues remain to be explored by any reader who pays attention.  I agree with the reviewer who stated that the chapter dealing with &quot;the better story&quot; is the key chapter of the book.  The Japanese investigator is left to decide between two explanations of the boy's survival: one which requires faith and one which required only a grasp of the mundane.  Martel's novel, in and of itself, is one which demonstrates that sometimes inexplicable miracles can occur, whether they be religious experiences or a wonderful first novel The novel truly makes one believe in the &quot;better &quot; story about the young man and the tiger.

B0000024SD|4.0|Bob Dylan's Bringing It All Back Home has a good blend of electric and acoustic songs.  Regardless there seems to be a nice warm energy that flows throughout the recording.  Subterrean Homesick Blues is a neat trippy blues tune while Maggie's Farm has a nice sing a long vibe.  The lyrics on Mr. Tambourine Man are quite special as well as Its Alright Ma(I'm Only Bleeding).  Like the false start on Bob Dylan's 115th Dream.  Its good when musicians record in a loose and relaxed fashion.<br />Anyway, this record is strong on charm and loaded with good lyrics.  Even Dylan's vocals are in good form.  It wins my seal of approval.
B00008O0WN|4.0|...Picard's new Number One after losing Will Riker to the captaincy of his own that only the opportunity to serve with Picard has kept him from. Otherwise, Riker would have been a skipper years ago. Picard is also losing his shipboard shrink--the newlywed Danna Troi Riker is taking that job on her husband's ship. The Riker wedding gives to Picard a happier mood throughout the film. He loses the wise but stern personality all but demanded by his Roman coin face in other \\"TNG\\" material--he jokingly addresses Riker as \\"Mr. Troi\\" at one point. Well, The Missus has always struck me as having a Daddy's Girl relationship with her captain anyway. But now the Rikers have one last mission with their soon-to-be ex-captain. And it's a doozy--a diplomatic mission to the Romulans. I guess it was inevitable--look at the way they joined the Alliance in the Dominion War in the last few \\"DS9\\" episodes. There's a cameo here by Kate Mulgrew as Admiral Janeway, who gives Picard the orders. Funny, it hadn't occurred to me she was senior to Picard. Maybe it's a case just like with Riker--Picard being satisfied with his posting and not wanting to get stuck with flag rank. That scene also renewed my anger at my cable provider--I missed the last two seasons of \\"Voyager\\" because Fox stopped syndicating the series and my cable guys couldn't be bothered to come up with a UPN channel. So I didn't get to see any of the episodes in which Cap'n Kate and her Merry Men come home. But be warned--this movie has the grittiness of the \\"TNG\\" Borg cycle. Romulan Praetor Shinzon is a younger clone of Picard who has patricidal urges and a nasty way of dealing with opposition--a ray which renders organic matter biologically inert. It would have been a cliche to call it a \\"Medusa Weapon\\", but you literally get turned to stone. The ultimate target--Earth. A weapon of mass destruction used by a fanatical dictator, first on his own domestic opposition, then on a foreign target. Well, they do say that a lot of sci fi is current events imprinted upon the future. Oh yeah, Mr. Data, right? On the way to the Riker-Troi wedding on Betazed, they follow the trail of a positronic signature to a planet and find an early model of the android that the current one hadn't known existed. They find him literally torn limb from limb, they put Humpty Dumpty back together again, turn him on, and he works. Which gives Data a new family project to deal with--if you will recall, his \\"daughter\\" died before her time, and we all know what kind of paragon of familial virtue big brother Lore turned out to be. Fortunately, this elder sibling is innocent and naive, like we remember Data himself from the early \\"DS9\\" episodes. There's a lot of action here, things go kerblooey and kerblam, there's even a dune buggy chase scene on the desert planet where they find Data's big bro, in which everyone thunders around on machines you'd swear from the sound all have Mopar V-8s. There's still oil in the 23rd century? It would greatly surprise me if they don't come out with a game based on that scene. Play-Stay-Shoan.fi is current events imprinted upon the future.

0789723107|5.0|I have been developing websites professionally for four years now, and have thumbed through quite a collection of references on usability and &quot;good design&quot;.  None of them come close to matching Mr. Krug's message of a simple common sense approach.<br />It's easy for us to get too close to our work and lose sight of the fact that 85% of the site's visitors will be brand new to it, and will leave as quickly as they arrived if they cannot find what they want right away.  Mr. Krug does a fantastic job at providing examples and melds that with his extensive experience in the field of usability and mixes in a healthy dose of wit to make it go down nice and smoothly. <br />It reads pretty quickly and to-the-point, which is very important for those of us who want to get back to work and apply this newfound knowledge.  Brevity seems to be all too uncommon in technical books, and yet that is where it is most appreciated!<br />So yes, much of what he writes may be common-sensical in retrospect, but at the same time it is highly relevant, as we all tend to forget what it was like to be a 'net newbie from time to time, and it is nice to be reminded.

0790731894|5.0|Even though Executive Decision today would remind the viewing audience of the tragic, if not cowardly attacks made by Islamic terrorists on September 11, 2001 AD, it is still an entertaining and enjoyable action/suspensful/political thriller. I mean, if any film has Steven Segal killed off within the first 40 minutes of the picture (mirroring Roy Thinnes's demise in Airport 1975) and British actor David Suchet playing an excellent heavy, then it has to be worth watching.<br />Released in 1996 by Warner Brothers, Executive Decision was the directorial debut of British film editor Stuart Baird (Superman - The Movie and Outland). With the material he had been given by screenwriters Jim and John Thomas, Baird does an excellent, if not remarkable job in film direction. Especially when it comes to the staging and filming of the action sequences.<br />The plot of the storyline centers around a group of Islamic Terrorists from the Middle East who hijack a 747 en route from Athens to Washington DC. The Islamic extremists main plan is to force the release of a known terrorist leader, who had been captured and imprisoned by British and American military forces.<BR>Unknown to some of the terrorists, their leader has smuggled a Soviet nerve toxin gas left over from the Cold War. A nerve gas hooked up to a bomb, which is controlled by an al-Queida sleeper agent. The real purpose of the terrorist leader is soon revealed. His plans are to use the 747 as a weapon and detonate the nerve agent over Washington, killing all citizens there and those living along most of the East Coast.<br />Enter into the picture a group of U.S. Army anti-terrorist commadoes, along with a intelligence analyst/field operative from the Pentagon and an aircraft designer. Their mission is to transfer from a U.S. Air Force stealth fighter onto the 747 in mid-air, locate the nerve toxin, deactivate the bomb, kill all of the terrorists and sleeper agents with extreme prejudice, re-take the plane, and ensure thesafety of the passengers and flight crew. Easier said than done. With the help of a courageous flight attendant/stewardess and a U.S. Sky Marshal, it becomes a fight to the death five miles above the Earth, with the fate of the U.S. Capitol and the eastern seaboard hanging in the balance.<br />Better than Air Force One, The Delta Force, The Die Hard Trilogy, and the Under Siege films, Executive Decision pulls all the punches and the stops when it comes to high flying action and high octane political thrillers. With a cast that consists of Kurt Russell, David Suchet (in a non-Hercule Poirot role), Halle Berry, Whip Hubley, Oliver Platt, B.D.Wong, Joe Morton, John Leguizamo, Andreas Katsulas, the late Charles Hallahan and J.T. Walsh, it is an ultimate winner in explosive action and political thrillers. Even the soundtrack by veteran composer Jerry Goldsmith is explosive and excellent. One of his best soundtracks since the 1968 version of Planet Of the Apes.<br />If you enjoy films that deal with politics, the U.S. Government's policy of not negotiating with terrorists, and the right-winged, if not the best way, to eliminate Middle Eastern terrorism, then Executive Decision is the film for you.

This is another treasure hunt but the best part of the book is not the hunt but the treasure and the story behind it.<br />I read most of &quot;Holy Blood, Holy Grail&quot; many years ago so I already knew something of the legend of the Knights Templars and the &quot;real&quot; Holy Grail.  The story fascinates me, though we'll probably never know if it's true.<br />This book is another boy/girl chase story that, without the treasure part, would be similar to &quot;The Bourne Identity&quot; or &quot;Three (or Six) Days of the Condor&quot;.  And for a lot of people that would be plenty.  For me, however, that would have just made it fairly routine and not that interesting.<br />I want to recommend this book to those who are unaware of the legend of the Knights Templars or Mary Magdalene, etc. for an eye-opening and thought-provoking story.  For those who aren't interested in opening their eyes or provoking their thoughts, I'm sure you'll enjoy it as a page-turning thriller.
B00006JKON|1.0|&gt;...opinions WILL differ.<br />Yes, but this is the record that caused Jethro Tull's original fans to leave in droves. (Nota bene: There is such a thing as good taste, and there is such a thing as bad taste.)<br />&gt;This is, as well, one of the heaviest Jethro Tull album [sic].<br />It may weigh slightly more than other Jethro Tull records, but only one song on it  has any hard rock, &quot;Back Door Angels&quot;, and that only in the instrumental sections--and the difference in quality between Martin Barre's solo on it and his solo on &quot;Aqualung&quot; is the difference between night and day. The rest of the instrumental sections are pretty much Irish jigs and perhaps a polka or two. I've nothing against Irish jigs in particular, but I prefer them not to be played on the soprano or sopranino saxophone, and I prefer them in moderate quantity only. <br />&gt;By the way, when IA refers to kitties in &quot;Bungle&quot;, whose to say that he's making reference to the cats in your homes? He could be talking about wild cats, the large animals in the jungle. <br />He is obviously distinguishing cute, cuddly domestic kittens (not cats) and insidious jungle beasts. If you don't get that, you don't get the lyric.
B00005JM1F|5.0|This is one of the funniest movies I've seen in a long time.  Sure, the humor is baseless in some parts, but that's what makes it funny!  If you like \\"Dumb and Dumber,\\" \\"Road Trip,\\" \\"Animal House,\\" and others of their ilk, this movie is for you!
B00005ASIL|1.0|1) Although many soi-disant \\"best of\\" packages are really \\"greatest hits\\" packages, obviously a group's hits are not necessarily its best recordings--and this is very much the case with Jethro Tull. <br />2) On the other hand, in regard to Jethro Tull the point is moot, for Jethro Tull had only three (U.S.) hits, \\"Living in the Past\\", \\"Bungle in the Jungle\\", and \\"Too Old to Rock and Roll, Too Young to Die\\", hardly enough to fill an album.<br />(By the bye, in the period in which Jethro Tull sold records in significant quantities--the vinyl disc period, that is--, a hit record was a 45 rpm disc, distinct and separate from the 33 1/3 rpm LP its song may also have appeared on. In other words, to have a hit then, you REALLY had to have a hit, you really had to sell a great many actual copies of an actual record.)<br />4) Now it just so happens that, though the group has been continuously active from 1968 to 2003, the best of Jethro Tull was Jethro Tull from 1969 to 1973, as captured on the albums \\"Stand Up\\", \\"Benefit\\", Aqualung\\", Thick as a Brick\\", and \\"A Passion Play\\". All of these albums are of even and consistent quality with no particular stand-out tracks.<br />In view of points 1), 2), 3), and 4) above, it seems to me this record ought to have concentrated on the exceptional occasional good tracks from \\"the period of retreat\\", from post-\\"Passion Play\\" releases (with \\"My Sunday Feeling\\" from \\"This Was\\" thrown in for good measure). It could have included, for example, \\"Skating Away\\" from the otherwise dismal \\"War Child\\", \\"Moths\\" from \\"Heavy Horses\\", and, oh, say, \\"Pibroch\\" from \\"Songs from the Wood\\".
B00005QIPH|5.0|I love the Strokes' album \\"is this it?\\" :) <BR>The best songs on the album that I think are <BR>the best are \\"Is this it?\\" and \\"Someday\\". The rest are very good too but those 2 are the best songs on the album. ... This is my like second or third time of listening to their album! It rocks!! I recommend you buy their cd right away!!! All of the songs rock! There's not one that doesn't!!<br />P.S.<BR>I think Julian is cutest out of the whole band *shh* and this is my favorite band also!! :)
B00005JLRT|4.0|Just trust me on this one. When I first saw Nemesis last December, I was somewhat disappointed. I was especially disappointed b/c of the way we leave the TNG case, and upset about Data's quick departure.<br />Anyway, I purchased the DVD and just watched it again. Wow. It's SO much better the second time. It's one of those movies that you just need to let sink in to enjoy. I now consider it to be one of the better movies in the set. Rent it, and you'll see or just buy it.<br />Much better the second time.
0805062971|5.0|This is by far one of the best books that I have ever read. I read it in one sitting and could not put it down. I saw the movie when it came out, and loved it. When I found out that the movie was based on this novel, I just had to read it. I love the attitude of the narrator in this story. It is one that you just have to read in order to understand. I also read Survivor and loved it as well. Chuck is a great author and I will defanitaly be reading more of his books soon!
B000002UJQ|5.0|When Pink Floyd went bogus I went to jazz.  Stayed there for a decade and a half.  And then Radiohead somehow rubbed my brain with a cosmic feeler or something and they let me know I could come back.  And they did it with this album.
1878424319|5.0|Free time is browsing the book store and just reading whatever &quot;stands out&quot;.  A few years ago, my hand was caught on this book's binding as my fingertips scanned the shelf.  I pulled it out and my eyes liked the cover. That's how I was referred to this book.  Anyway, it has changed my life forever and I have since recommended it to many others.  It was worth more than the money I paid for it!  (Consumers that may not benefit from this book are those whom are unable/unwilling to look honestly at themselves and others.)  Glad to see it is featured here!
B00003CX5P|4.0|*Note*: I am not a die-hard Star Wars fan nor do i really like George Lucas and nor do i have stocks in any Star Wars stuff but this a good film....<br />I really can't stand people that have a vision of how something should be in their mind and if a movie doesn't emulate that they tear it down. How many times have i heard people whinging about this film. George should have done this....George should have done that...George has ruined my childhood .....blah blah blah....<br />Star Wars is and always was George's vision not anyone elses. He creates the foundation, the story, the characters and the evolution of this series. Granted other directors and writers have come on board but they all admit in countless documentaries that they always stuck with what George wanted in these films. <br />He is the master they were his tools.<br />So you saw a bunch of B-Grade sci-fi movies when you were a kid and have now developed some obsession over the meanings and memories that the older 3 sequels give. WAKE UP !!!!! Its a new century and a new Star Wars has imersed itself into the Galaxy.<br />Star Wars: Episode One is a good film told from a child's perspective to wrap the beginning of the story of Anakin Skywalker with innocence and wonder. For those who say that this is a child's film...well HELLLOOO...its meant to be, the film is about a child and the birth of the Empire. Its all about beginnings and beginnings are normally more subduded, (the stroy not the visuals). The visual are colourful and at the time of release alot of it was new, just like viewing things from the eyes of a child. This is a foundation movie meaning that alot of expostion has to be dealt out.<br />Furthermore, those that complain about the acting are clearly not understanding the nature of the people in these films. The acting is typical of Star Wars, ( i mean Mark Hamill always acted like he was in amatuer theatre),  and the child that played Anakin was perfect. You all seem to want a brillant childactor that can pour out adult like mannerisms and drama, excately how a child WOULD NOT ACT. I think that Anakin displayed good child like features and came across as a child not a small adult. This provided Anakin with a good sense of innocence. Yes. some lines were wooden but its STAR WARS, they always have been.<br />This episode is to set up a transional line between good and evil. I believe that the vision here is to start with good (Ep 1), move into both good and evil, (Ep 2), and then too evil itself, (Ep 3). The other 3 movies, (4,5,6), are a mish mash of good vs evil. It doesnt question the power of either besides Luke's internal struggle in Return Of The Jedi. You either are good or evil. The new movies however seem to question everyones motives and you can't help but feel that the new ones are more complex, not just visally but also story wise. I tend to think most people hate the story because it either too complex for them or too slow. This is a 6 act play really with two major storys, the tale of Anakin Skywalker and then the second half, the tale of his son Luke Skywalker. Try to separate the two distinct halfs. Luke story was told in the late 70's and 80's. Not only was the special effects more minumal then but i believe the story lines were too. It was just the good fight the evil. Granted these movies did it very well but the new ones are better. The political undercurrent is beautifully set out in Ep 1 and shows how democracy can be utlised for more evil intentions. There just seems to be an overall richness to the story that was lacking with the orginal 3.<br />Most seem to find that they don't like Ep 1 but like Ep 2 better so it only makes me think that everyone is just waiting to see the moment Darth Vader returns to the screen. Personnally i am enjoying the experience getting there. I do not go into these films trying to over anaylis or comparing them with my childhood experiences of the first 3, i dont compare every detail to what is clearly a confabulation of memories based on the first 3 films that a saw has a child and grew up with. I enjoy these films as orginal pieces of work that add not suntract from the overall mythos. <br />Episdoe One is a good film, its a good beginning but remember it is George's vision, not yours, not mine but his and he doesn't owe diddly to fans. If you don't want to see his vison stick to Star Trek. Don't see the films or make up yah own world and mythos, i mean many have tried and many have failed to copy the Star War theme but at the end of the day these films are huge because most people want to see the next chapter. If u want to make a film and have your vision then do it otherwise pay yah cash and see a good film and get hooked to a good legend that consists of 6 parts.<br />Episode One : TPM is a wonderful, entertaining film and the DVD only hightlights the work, imagination and skill that goes into making such a film. George Lucas comes across as a strong and confident man who has actually listened to the fans, ( i wouldnt, pack of nerds really), and created a DVD with every behind the scene aspect of this film that anyone could want.<br />I dare anyone to find a sci-fi film that is any better than this !!!!!!!!!

B00008J2DQ|5.0|This is the best album that Godsmack has done yet. If your a fan this cd is a must. From the first single of this cd I Stand Alone to other great songs on this cd like Make Me Belive and Releasing the Demons. This cd has a strong sound all the way through. This is a must have for your cd collection.
B00005JL78|2.0|This movie was predictable, boring and technically flawed.<br />The short story this movie is based on was written by the same person who wrote the story used in the movie Bladerunner.  And yes, the basic premise is fascinating, too bad the movie couldn't build upon this base premise in a meaningful or interesting way.  Instead they dove head first into the world of shock and cheese.<br />However, unlike Bladerunner, this movie came off as a typical piece of formulaic hollywood dribble.  Shame on the screenplay writer and director for this cinematic atrocity.<br />Quite honestly, the positive critical reviews this movie received still, to this day, puzzle me.<br />It is really a shame, because there was a ton of potential here, not to mention money spent to end up with such a flash-in-the-pan stinker.<br />If you want a GREAT futuristic thinker, then check out Vanilla Sky.
B000002OG8|3.0|i was unfamiliar with wishbone ash - although much of the hippy-blues rock music of this era fills my collection - so i snared this disc recently - and i'm pleased - these guys played their music because they loved it - they were obviously unconcerned with the critics of their time or with 'making the radio' - they just love the music - and you can get that 'feel' as you listen - the 'muse' plays within them - this is good music - if you like music played simply for the sake of the music (not the 'almighty dollar' or to 'hit the charts') then buy this - if you want catchy music with little jingles you can whistle while you're at work - then why are you at a wishbone ash page?<BR>space puppy out
B00005YW4H|4.0|This is exactly what you think it is: a nice album by a singer with a beautiful voice that you can listen to any time you want to mellow out.  I especially like it in a random rotation with other albums as it seems to mix well with almost any other style.
B00005JKPF|5.0|The movie started out with lots of action and it didn't stop till the end.  It's cool how troughout the movie it leads up to the next X-men movie.  The fight scenes where incredible.  Lady Deathstrike and Wolverines fight scene was the best one.  Can't say enough about the whole experince.  Would defiantely go and see this again at the movies.
B000001DVD|5.0|I agree that high & dry did mark a transition period for def leppard, but the rawness of the guitar on this recording combined with the early production of mutt lange create one of British heavy metals finest works. From the opening riff of \\"let it go\\" this album will probably please listeners who enjoy 80's iron maiden, judas priest, ac/dc and early ozzy. I personaly find much in common with ac/dc's back in black - another fine mutt lange recording. The lead guitar work of Pete Willis is strongly blues based yet aggressive and quite appropriate for this record. Also, if you enjoy Joe Elliot's vocal timbre and melodies then you should have a degree of comfort with high & dry. A bit of caution. If you expect high & dry to sound like the richly crafted hysteria, it does not. The massive ooh-ahh vocals which became a def leppard trademark on later albums had not fully developed at the time of this recording. Nor do samples and lushly layered effects color high & dry's songs to the degree of later works. In conclusion, high & dry is a personal favorite; well recorded, good composition and unique vocal stylizations marking a period in def leppard's histoy just before they became hugely successful.
B000002UA0|1.0|Damn, I wasted my money on this stupid album! I can't understand why Floyd has so many fans! It is usually safe to buy the debut album of a &quot;supergroup&quot;, but either this assumption doesn't hold good for this band or they're just another mediocre, overrated band.
B00008LOS1|5.0|Despite giving it five stars, I can't help but wonder why on earth these bonus tracks were not included on the already great 1996 reissue, that featured most of these songs, though only two from the Young Vic shows. The rest of the songs are available, either on Odds and Sods or on the 1996 expanded cd I own.<br />Don't get me wrong, I love The Who, but seems the record company can't stop milking the cash cow that endless reissues are. The sound quality on the earlier and expanded reissue was already great, so one has to sit and wonder the whys behind this (Apparently last) new edition.
B000003TA4|1.0|The worst album I ever purchased was 'Nevermind'. I had expected it to be excellent since Nirvana fans recommended it so highly. But I'm sorry to say that the cadaverous threesome have let me down. It is hard to listen to more than 3 songs at one go! I found the album to be monotonous &amp; boring. The songs are very bad and the vocals are awful.
B000096BLG|4.0|A very smooth Jazzy album with probably the best songs of Michael Franks, very hard to get hold of but definitely one one should have, if one likes Franks
B00005JLWN|2.0|Although the concluding final scene is pretty good, this movie was dry and the plot was not worthy of being compared to the Matrix or even Gattaca, another futuristic plot favorite of mine.  Bale holds his own and Diggs is decent.  The concept was original but just not enough.  Ok movie but it's not the Matrix.
0385507755|5.0|While reading this story I was in the middle of a very similar situation with my brother  ( heroin addict ) and it was very helpful for me to see inside the rehab walls and I felt as if this story was my brother's.

B00005JLSC|5.0|At first, I just wasn't' interested in seeing Chicago.  After all, it's a musical.  I don't usually like musicals.  But then it got nominated for an Academy Award.  I was curious as to what all the fuss was about.  And so I went to see it and sat in a packed theater just plain relaxing and letting myself be completely entertained.  Yes, this is a musical.  But it's done 2002 style.  In other words not only are  there lights, action and camera - there's also  fantastic film editing and camerawork, and such great pacing that I was completely carried away with the story and the music.<br />The story is set in Chicago in the 1920s, a time where corruption was a \\"given\\", and the road to stardom lay in lurid headlines.  So when vaudeville star Velma Kelly, played by Catherine Zeta-Jones, murders her sister and husband in a jealous rage, the newspapers go wild.  She's in prison but is sure she can get off because of the good lawyer she has hired, played by Richard Gere. And the prison matron, played by Queen Latifah is helping her - for a price.  Well, along comes another murderess, Roxie Hart, played by Renee Zellweger, who has also murdered her lover.  The difference is that Roxie is not a star yet, just an aspiring one.  She's married to John C. Reilly, who's a bit dumb but loves his wife.  She convinces him to pay for her defense.  Now, there's competition between the two murderesses for the headlines.  It's all great fun to watch.  And the magnificent singing and dancing numbers really do move the action along.<br />Catherine Zeta-Jones is a trained dancer and it shows. And of course Queen Latifah can really belt out a song.  John C. Reilly also has a vaudeville background.  But Renee Zellweger and Richard Gere had to learn to sing and dance for their parts.  I am impressed. They are wonderful.  The late Bob Fosse was one of the originators of the show, which opened in 1975.  It's been a hit all these years.  But this film translates it into a musical event.  I loved it.  And, even though the plot gets a little lurid at times, everyone can enjoy it.  It's a big, bold and beautiful production. If possible, try to see it in a theater  with good sound.  Highly recommended.it.   And, even though the plot gets a little lurid at times, everyone can enjoy it.

B00007BH5C|5.0|To me, it is all one big movie. But, that doesn't limit the brilliant Howard Shore from adding diversity to his already powerful soundtrack. Though it clearly rings similar to the original score, Two Towers hits a bull's-eye with the fresh new tracks. The music of &quot;Riders of Rohan&quot; and &quot;King of the Golden Hall&quot; give the score its uniqueness. But everything wraps up well, both in the film and here on CD, with the final battle tracks. We are given the gift of beautiful music in &quot;Forth Eorlings&quot;, &quot;Isengard Unleashed&quot;, and the concluding track &quot;Samwise the Brave.&quot;  Not to mention, like its predecessor, this has a vocal track, only much more haunting and appealing than Enya, in &quot;Gollum's Song.&quot; Overall, this is the perfect score to a nearly perfect movie.
B00003CXB4|5.0|This movie truly was Disney's paramount achievement.  The Lion King was a culmination of years of tweaking and mastering the formula for animated films, and I think the result really blew people away.  For this movie, Disney literally used all the tricks to produce a masterpiece that transcended the genre.  The greatest compliment we can give to this film is that it's not only known as the greatest animated movie of all time, it's one of the best to ever hit the big screens.<br />Are there flaws to this movie?  After four viewings, I'm convinced that the answer is \\"no\\" (unless you think the subliminal \\"SEX\\" that appears in the dirt and leaves when Simba plops onto the ground under the stars somehow diminishes the movie's quality... hey, it was kinky and, in retrospect, foolish, but it takes nothing away from the movie).<br />If you haven't seen The Lion King, you've sadly deprived yourself of an unforgettable experience.  Truly funny, touching, inspiring, gripping, and triumphant, it's a real tribute to Disney, especially since in the nineties, this was a company known for its mediocre or embarrassingly bad flicks.  <br />The Lion King shines head and shoulders above the crowd... this movie was so good, it changed the animation scene... not until Toy Story did an animated film produced in the U.S. (one could say the Japanese animation Princess Mononoke was as good, if not better, than TLK) come even close to the bar of excellence TLK set.  The fact that we still remember it, nine years later, as a classic that must be rewatched speaks volumes for its lasting legacy.
B00005QZWI|5.0|Every few years sees a new movie score which becomes a part of our culture. Star Wars, Jaws, Jurassic Park, Gladiator, all are remembered because they stand out. Fellowship is no different. Here, we are presented with a fantastic blend of various styles, each reflecting their own part of Middle Earth. An epic film such as this is only glorified by a score like this. Songs like &quot;Bridge of Khazad-Dum&quot; and &quot;The Great River&quot; are already spreading like wildfire. Howard Shore employs various themes in his music, which provides a pleasant flow. There are upbeat tunes, like &quot;Concerning Hobbits&quot;, which remind us of his multi-genre aim, as well as dark and chilling songs, like &quot;A Knife in the Dark.&quot; This is a redefinition of modern movie scores, and it will be remembered as one of the greatest scores ever.
B00005JKG7|4.0|A good ghost story. Although this not John Carpenter's best film but it certainly is one of his better ones.A sleepy coastal town is terrorized by vengeance seeking pirates who want their gold that was stolen exactly one hundred years ago.Not overly scary but some chills and a spooky story will keep you interested. Jamie Lee Curtis is good as a hitchiker who stumbles upon the eerie happenings,Hal Holbrook is convincing as Father Malone, and Adrienne Barbeau as the lighthouse music DJ does a fine job.The appearence of the eerie glowing FOG is well done and the music is also effective.
037542217X|5.0|I spent a couple of weeks in Botswana at the game parks. I was always impressed by how nice the Botswanans were.

B00004Z400|5.0|In 2000, the Deftones unleashed this album onto the world. Many fans didn't know what to make of the new direction the 'Tones took. Some were dissapointed, others appreciated the album, many loved it. Personally, I think this is a great album. I dare you to listen to songs like &quot;Digital Bath&quot;, &quot;Knife Prty&quot;, and &quot;Passenger (f/Maynard James Keenan)&quot; and not get goosebumps. It also includes a CD-Xtra thing where you can watch them rehearse &quot;Elite&quot;, and you can even play a Pac-Man-like game, very nice. I have yet to hear their newest release, but my birthday is a week from today, so I'll get it then. This album would definitely benefit anyone's collection. Recommended.
B00008D1NF|2.0|Listen carefully to the sound samples. I didn't and look who's crying now. I should've known, I pulled the name of this group off of an NPR radio skit about the new sound coming out of Brazil. I kick myself for this because I always am disappointed by my NPR inspired purchases. This is no exception. The music contained on this is anodyne but not pleasantly so. I guess the metaphor would be how a junkee feels on methadone vs the kick he gets from a snootful of heroin. The sound is innocuous, if pleasant, but has no life, no spark, no joie de vivre, if you get my je nes c'est quoi, or whatever. Don't buy this unless you like bland and uninspiring background music, pleasant notwithstanding. Track 11 is nice, however. As is Track 12 which unwittingly samples Sly & the Family Stone's \\"It's a Family Affair.\\"  If you would like to hear something that I believe represents the Real NEW sound of Brazil, check out a band 'Zuco 103.'  Whether it is the kind of sound you want, it is at least original.
B00000099Y|5.0|Brilliant. Just brilliant. I remember about a little over a year ago when I first heard &quot;StinkFist&quot;, and I was blown away. It's truly a beautiful song. I just got the album a couple of months ago, and let me just say, this whole album is INCREDIBLE. It may not be unbelievably heavy (like Slayer or Hatebreed), but it still rocks, and it has intellegent, thought-provoking lyrics that actually might be a little harder to figure out. Each song is great, you don't even have to skip any tracks. If you like one song, you'll like them all. This whole album is just an experience (sorry to quote the title again, but it's true). I recommend buying it, putting it on LOUD, and just get lost....lost in a world of Tool. Recommended.
B000002GB6|5.0|Mangione finally achieved large-scale popular and commercial success with this album.  However, his previous fans all knew that &quot;Feels So Good&quot; was just a continuing development in his already impressive music career.  This album would still get a 5 star rating even without the title track.  Unfortunately, the title track was so overplayed by pop radio in 1978, that casual Mangione fans got sick and tired of hearing it.  But 25 years later, this music is still as wonderful as it was back then.  Alas for us true Mangione fans, this album was as good as it was to get from Mangione for the next 20 years.  But we have never grown tired of his mid-1970s cool jazz.  This album and &quot;Chase The Clouds Away&quot; are absolute must haves.  Now only if they would reissue &quot;Bellavia&quot; and &quot;Main Squeeze&quot; on cd.
B000021YQV|5.0|Yes, you read that right. Out of all of 2001's albums, including Slipknot's &quot;Iowa&quot; and Staind's &quot;Break The Cycle&quot; (both great), this one gets the honor of that year's best album. Why, you ask? Because it's amazing. Really.<br />The CD kicks off with &quot;Prison Song&quot;. It's a great song with a funny stop-start intro, and the part where Serj mocks Fred Durst is hilarious. &quot;Needles&quot; is funny, catchy, and hard all at once. At one point the guitars are actually reminiscent of early Metallica. (you heard me) &quot;Deer Dance&quot; is superb, the lyrics are sweet and a great shout-along chorus. &quot;Jet Pilot&quot; is a fast, hard song that's over before you even know what hit you. &quot;X&quot; was awesome at first, but gets old kind of fast. Next we have &quot;Chop Suey!&quot;. Unless you were living under a rock from August 2001 to early 2002, I probably don't need to explain this one. Still, choice song. &quot;Bounce&quot; is probably the only mediocre song on here. &quot;Forest&quot; is just one excellent song, in the vein of &quot;Spiders&quot; from SOAD's first LP. &quot;ATWA&quot; has kind of soft verses, then the chorus hits you and the ending leaves you wanting more. &quot;Science&quot; is quality SOAD with their famous political views. &quot;Shimmy&quot; is just a short but good song, like &quot;X&quot;. &quot;Toxicity&quot;, another single, is just a fantastic song with a great chorus. &quot;Psycho&quot; opens up with a disco-ish beat, then proceeds with singable lyrics. Very nice. Finally, there's &quot;Aerials&quot;, which is a brilliant song.<br />All in all, this album is most certainly an essential, and I recommend it to anyone with a CD player.

B00005JLYU|5.0|Come June 27th the Angels will be back in theatres with its follow up sequel to the 2000 Action blockbuster hit Charlies Angels with Charlies Angels: Full Throttle. Seeing as the movie isn't out for another few weeks, I'll simply be going over some aspects of what to expect from this upcoming action hit. Comparing and contrasting the original to the sequel. Furthermore, I will also review the movie and edit this review when its released in cinemas.<br />But what's to be expected from this movie Franchise?<br />So far we can only go with what the trailers and blurbs tell us.<BR>So lets start with the plot - The Angels are ready to strike without warning and kick some serious [rear-end] as they go undercover to retrieve two missing silver bands. These are no ordinary wedding rings. They contain valuable encrypted information that reveals the new identities of every person in the federal Witness Protection Program. When witnesses start to turn up dead, only the Angels can stop the perpetrator, using their expertise as masters of disguise, espionage and martial arts.<br />Any people who have seen the first movie would know that the film wasn`t meant to be a `serious' action flick. Drew Barrymore, who had the idea for doing a Charlie's Angels movie, is responsible for the tone that the movie would portray. Although the film is a revised and recast take off of the old 70's show, it can still make fun of itself which is always a good aspect to have in filmmaking. <br />But we should meet the Angels before we go any further. First, we have Alex (Lucy Liu), trying to develop her cooking skills to try and be incognito as an aspiring housewife. Although her cooking falls sub-par as the muffins she cooks can break through doors. Then there's Dylan (Drew Barrymore) trying to find her other half, to only be teamed up with the `Chad'. And finally we have Natalie (Cameron Diaz), the geeky virgin who lives her fantasy showbiz lifestyle in dreams. And remember `Feel free to stick things in her slot'. All team together to become the cool, sexy, lethal weapon packing, espionage trio that are Charlie's Angels.<br />We then have the Charlie's Angels other half....Charlie. Of course Charlie is one of the most famous voice overs in television (and now movie) history. But of course seeing as he is undercover, his identity can never be revealed. So he puts all of his mission stats through Bosley, played by Bill Murray in the original. But seeing as movie's change through sequels, Bill Murray will not be present in this film. Instead Bernie Mac will take his place to be the new comic relief that we all love. Speaking of new additions we have Demi Moore instated to play the antagonistic femme fatale. Also `Creepy Thin Guy' is back once again, I believe. The cast who have signed on for this sequel, as you can see, are above average and should contribute to us putting down our money to see this movie. My fingers are still crossed for the sensational Tim Curry to be present in Full Throttle.<br />But what also made the first film so successful (and may contribute to spending our time seeing the sequel) was the outrageous stunts and the plentifulness of outfits with the mix of humour and energy from both cast and crew. This can also be seen in the trailers for `Full Throttle'. We have the Angels dressed up in all kinds of outfits, ranging from Cowgirl to Biker girl ensembles.  We have explosions from tanks and rockets. We have the humour and layed back persona's of the Angels. And all these ingredients make for a good recipe of Action-Comedy with a very heroine angle (Which is always nice to see).<br />Although, whether the director McG (yes, that is his name) will deliver an enjoyable sequel will only be known by June 27th. But if you're in the mood for a fun, raunchy, action packed movie. I suggest to give Charlies Angels: Full Throttle a viewing. <br />Stay tuned for my review when its been released in cinemas.
0393057658|5.0|Before reading Moneyball, I had two Bill James books in my bookcase, but they were strictly for show.  Before reading Moneyball, I never once cared about the drafting and development of minor league baseball players.  Before reading Moneyball, I never paid much attention to the reading of box scores.  This book (which is extraordinarily well-written) has changed all that.<br />Michael Lewis presents a unique and different view of measuring the value of baseball players, and a new way to evaluate players' talent.  It's impossible to come away from this book without an altered view of baseball in general.  After finishing Moneyball, I sat down and watched the Cubs-Pirates game from start to finish, looking at the nuances at the game I had missed before.  I haven't done that in years.<br />More importantly, this book got me thinking.  I'm not sure that Billy Beane has revolutionized baseball.  Much of Beane's ideas were also lifted from the Cleveland Indians' approach to scouting and player development from the early 90s.  Led by Hank Peters and his assistant John Hart, the Tribe signed such luminaries as Manny Ramirez, Albert Belle and Jim Thome to long-term contracts, then developed their skills with an emphasis on long counts and walks.  Lewis fails to mention this point, but his reports on theories of the game are fascinating.<br />Lewis' reporting is top-notch.  The chapter where Beane and his staff work to conduct the 2002 amateur draft is completely riveting.  Also, the account of Beane's &quot;trawling&quot; for players through trades is equally first-rate.  And I don't think Billy Beane has been deified at all.  He treats some people who are rather integral to his success rather shabbily (think Art Howe or Miguel Tejada).<br />However, it is impossible to deny Billy Beane's influence on the game.  The Red Sox and Blue Jays have both hired Beane disciples to run their front office -- heck, the Red Sox even hired Bill James.  Any book that can rekindle a fan's interest in baseball deserves five stars.  I'm already deep into my first Bill James book, which had sat untouched for the last eight years.<br />Definitely worth the money.'s interest in baseball deserves five stars.  I'm already deep into my first Bill James book, which had sat untouched for the last eight years.<br />Definitely worth the money.
B00005JLEU|5.0|I also have heard that this movie was \\"confusing\\" or \\"random.\\"  I felt it was just the opposite.  This is a strongly character-driven story... not just another dumb adventure.  The point is there, but you can't sit there brain-dead, drooling through the movie and expect the point to be hammered home at the end.<br />BUY IT... no matter what your age, it's a movie worth watching many times.
0393057658|5.0|Moneyball is one of the most enjoyable books I've read in quite some time.  It very bluntly states why teams like the Kansas City Royals continue to wallow in their misery while teams with some semblance of intelligence in the front office can thrive, all in a very concise and easy to read manner.  Key discoveries, like McCracken's theories on pitchers not being able to control balls in play, and other defining moments in the way baseball statistics are looked at are given ample space to develop without overwhelming the reader with regression analysis. <br />Looking past the brief sabermetric focused parts of the book, it is simply a great tale with many intriguing characters.  Scott Hatteberg, the converted catcher who has to learn a new position.  Jason Giambi, who is what most Oakland As will become after their six years of indentured servitude.  Jeremy Giambi, his defensively challenged brother.  Chad Bradford, a soft throwing pitcher with an unorthodox delivery.  Jeremy Brown, a overweight catcher who has a propensity for finding his way on base.  And of course, Billy Beane, a man who gets plenty of publicity today, some good, but a lot negative from people too narrow minded to think in new ways.  <br />One question that some people believe remains after the novel is &quot;what happens when all of baseball thinks the way the As, Blue Jays, and Red Sox now do?&quot;  The answer is contained in the book - its not likely to happen anytime soon, dispite the overwhelming evidence for many teams to have a complete brain overhaul. Commentators like Joe Morgan, (occassionally Peter Gammons), GMs like Allaird Baird, and managers like Larry Bowa will be in power for the next decade or two, and don't look like they'll change their ways short of a 162-0 season out of the As.
0312305060|4.0|&quot;The Hours,&quot; a tribute to Virginia Woolf's novel 'Mrs. Dalloway,' depicts one day in the life of three different women from three different eras. Virginia Woolf is the first woman from the 1920's; the second is a post World War II housewife in LA; the third is a woman nicknamed &quot;Clarissa,&quot; (Mrs. Dalloway's first name), a modern day New Yorker who lives with her female lover. <BR>I respected this book and the author's efforts to pull these three disparate stories together. The author manages to portray accurately so many of the darker shades of the emotional palette: grief, despair, anguish, suicidal longings, and so on. A plot twist near the end knitted together two of the stories.<BR>I would recommend reading &quot;Mrs. Dalloway&quot; first to increase your understanding of this book. Small yet telling nuances leave you thinking throughout the night. For example, in Mrs. Dalloway, the heroine is a prosperous London housewife preparing for a party who looks back on a brief kiss with a woman in her youth; in &quot;The Hours,&quot; the modern day Clarissa is a lesbian hostess preparing for a party who looks back longingly on a heterosexual relationship from her youth. However, you can appreciate this book without reading Woolf first.<BR>I would recommend this book to those individuals who gravitate towards serious, thoughtful contemporary literature. English Lit junkies-particularly Woolf fans-should also try it. (Even if Woolf followers don't like the book, they still can discuss it.) <BR>I would not recommend this book to individuals who needs some levity in their reading. This book does not leave you &quot;feeling good&quot; but it does make you think a lot.
B00005JKJA|5.0|Since many have gone through some of the movie's finer points, I will skip that and add my concise opinion.  The film is confusing and, admittedly, I was not too thrilled with it on first viewing.  I was lost but captivated.  The music, the visuals and the intensity drew me in but I was put off by not understanding.  After reading an essay or two and discussing the film with some friends, I realized that it is intricate but not impenetrable.  A small bit of digging will get you to see the truth of the film and the basic devices in its flow.  Once that is understood, the movie comes alive and introduces powerful themes, complex symbols and many, many nuances.  Lynch has created a film that, once one can get through the tough exterior, opens itself to immeasurable depth and impeccable acting.
B000060K4O|5.0|I first saw this movie twenty years ago. I could not stop laughing then and I cannot stop laughing now.<BR>Dan Aykroyd and Bill Murray had perfected a deadpan comedic style by then that meshed beautifully with this script. Even in comedy, it is a stretch to assume that grown men would fight green monsters--and build a business from it- in the Manhattan of the 1980's. Sigourney Weaver plays off the male leads seamlessly as their client whose apartment is ground zero for the monsters. When you see her in this role, and think of her later one in Working Girl, you wish she had done more comedy throughout her career. Rick Moranis is hysterical as her neighbor, an accountant looking for a good time. I wish I had seen him in more roles over the past few years.<BR>Time has been kind to this movie. Yes some things are dated but that makes the film more enjoyable in many ways. <BR>The DVD offers a fun voice over track from the director and others. You learn a number of interesting things-Moranis was not the original choice for the role, for instance-and hear about how various shots were filmed in the Manhattan locations. You get the idea from the participants in the voice over track that these were their &quot;good old days.&quot; Even if you own the VHS, the DVD is worth the purchase for the voice over track and deleted scenes. <BR>I would recommend this movie for those who enjoy comedy, particularly of the broad and physical genre. Yes there are many, many great, crackling lines throughout the movie. However, if witty repartee is your thing, well this movie may not be for you. For the rest of you, sit back and enjoy.
B000084T18|5.0|wow! <BR>I was really impressed with this album. having first recieved it as a gift I automatically assumed that it would be the usual luke-warm attempt at a muscular black man trying to make a ghetto fabulous rap song, full of explicits and a tedious beat. How wrong was I? 50cent has the beats,the ryhmes,and the base and, boy does he have the talent!<BR>the album starts off fantastic, with tunes that really get you going, such as the world renound &quot;in da club&quot; &quot;many men&quot; and &quot;high all the time&quot;, and despite the fact that as the tunes continue they gradually become weaker lyrically and far more explicit, 50 managed to keep me bopping throughout- and thats an achievement.<BR>fantastic album, i recomend it to everyone.
B00005JLT5|5.0|I see dozens of movies each year. I have studied about and read hundreds of books on World War II and seen many of the movies and mini-series on it.<BR>Yet I never felt closer to the horror, the reality and the mundane day-to-day living of it than through this film.<BR>Roman Polanski lived as a child in a Jewish Ghetto in Poland. His experience informs each moment of this film and takes the viewer right into the streets and the alleys of late 1930's, early1940's Poland.<BR>The film begins with the young pianist, portrayed memorably by Adrien Brody, playing for the Polish radio. The studio ends up being bombed-but it is more of a \\"ok, here are the bombs, let's move on,\\" than an overally dramatic reaction. That's the beauty of this movie: surreal horror is incorporated into everyday lives.<BR>The film then traces the descent of Brody and his family from their beautiful aparment in the city, into a smaller one in the ghetto, into the waiting area for a concentration camp. They are not saints-they fight, they snip at small things, they roll their eyes at an annoying woman in the waiting area (until they hear her tragedy)-and such humanity makes the horror so much more real.<BR>Through a series of improbable twists (but as has been noted, those who survived did so only because of improbable twists), Brody's character escapes the train to the concentration camp and ends up going underground in the city. I won't say more to ruin anything.<BR>I would highly recommend this movie to individuals who appreciate serious, intelligent moviemaking on profound themes. I would not recommend this movie to individuals who need a lot of action or melodrama or levity. This movie achieves a soul searing impact not through hand-wringing dramatic scenes but through subtle and at times silent small moments.
B00003CXCD|5.0|ROMAN HOLIDAY is without any question one of the greatest Romantic fantasies in the history of film. The story of a European princess who manages to escape her handlers and experience a single day living as a normal, everyday things-managing to fall in love with someone with whom her position forbade her to have a relationship with-could have been trite in the hands of less perfect performers. It is hard to imagine any actress who could have been more convincing as royalty, yet more adorable while living one day as a comparable nobody. When she leaves Gregory Peck near the end of the film to return to her royal duties, your heart breaks for her, and her resumption of her royal role feels as self-sacrificial and heroic as any act of bravery one can imagine.<br />Audrey Hepburn single handedly makes this a great film, with some great assists. She is completely irresistible. A member of royalty sneaking away to enjoy a day with the common people is much harder to pull off than one might imagine, and it would have been quite simple to have made of this film something that was silly and unwatchable. But from the moment we first see Audrey Hepburn lose her shoe while surreptitiously attempting to scratch her ankle with her foot, our heart and our sympathy belongs to her. Just as Joe (Gregory Peck's character) does later, we want to protect her and comfort her, and allow her to enjoy the joys of life that her position in life has denied her. This was not her first film, but it was major role, and it has to count as one of the great major screen debuts in film history, rivaling that of James Dean in EAST OF EDEN.<br />While absolutely no one can question the perfection of Audrey Hepburn starring in this film, I have always been surprised at the criticism of Gregory Peck in his role. While I will grant that Cary Grant might have been slightly better in the role (but, then, how many movies would that not have been true of?), I still find Peck's performance to be excellent. Moreover, without casting Gregory Peck, the film would have lost the most famous scene, where Peck pretends to lose his hand in the mouth of the carving in the wall. That was not in the script, and everyone agrees that he adlibbed it on the spot. Hepburn's startled reaction was more believable because she was genuinely shocked. There is a third star as well: the city of Rome. I know of no film in which Rome looks more enchanting and more magical. Many films portray Paris in alluring fashion, but this is the great film about Rome.<br />The original story was by Dalton Trumbo, who was in 1953 on the Hollywood Blacklist for refusing to name names and for his leftist politics, so the story credit is given to Ian McLellan Hunter, who fronted for Trumbo. Hunter won the Oscar for Best Writing for a Motion Picture Story. Trumbo also won an Oscar for THE BRAVE ONE writing under the fake name Robert Rich.reover, without casting Gregory Peck, the film would have lost the most famous scene, where Peck pretends to lose his hand in the mouth of the carving in the wall.

6300216209|1.0|This is without a doubt one of the worst movies I have ever seen.  Ali McGraw, although beautiful to look at, was one of the worst actors to ever grace the silver screen.  Guess being married to one of the top honchos at Paramount at the time did wonders for her career!  Ryan O'Neil also was rotten.  I just could noy buy him as the preppie Oliver, he just didn't come across as the Ivy League type.  <BR>As I recall the book, Jennie was a fiesty, spirited girl, McGraw sounds like she's reading her lines off cue cards, with absolutley NO emotion. She is not at all convincing.    There was NO chemistry between either McGraw or O'Neil, they appear not to even like each other.<BR>Not a very good rendition of a sweet little story.
B00008MNYS|4.0|I have never been able to figure out why Robbie Williams isn't HUGE in the US. He's so talented and just plain fun to listen to and sing along with.  This is yet another great collection of songs that will hopefully catapult him into the ranks of musical stars where he belongs.  &quot;Monsoon&quot; is probably my favorite of all the songs because I can't help but laugh right along with him.  Definitely a must-have for Robbie fans...and everyone else too!
B000001GQB|5.0|Symphony 41 is my favorite symphony of all time and this is the best recording of it that I have heard to date. It is emotionally moving and vibrant and is definitely worth the purchase! The last two movements are my special favorites, but also the first movement of symphony 39 is excellent, as is the third. These four movements constitute, in my opinion, the best of the album but the whole thing is worth a listen.
B000002H6C|5.0|This in my opinion is one of the pinacle albums IN metal,right up there with Black Sabbath(paranoid)and Deep Purple's(machine head).The album is so naturally brutal and raw that it almost burns up your CD player while its spining around.Even though the production was a bit shabby for the time...this guitar sound set the stage for many albums from metal bands throughout the 90's.Take a listen to Rust in Peace...Sacred Reich's(the american way)same ole flat but raw production,on purpose?(maybe so)..and riff wise listen to some of the Chords off the classic At the Gates(slaughter of the soul),you'll Definately hear the influence of Justice on these gem's.Hetfield was at his Riffing prime,Lars bust's out double bass blasts to make the devil shiver in his boots,Kirk rips leads like a man possesed and well jason im sure if you could hear him,hits some good crunchy ole bass lines.All that said this album is just classic as hell,and will ALWAYS be hailed as ONE of my favorite metal albums of all time.
B000002NIW|5.0|This is the greatest Deftones album ever. I cannot describe how much this album means to me and to other Deftones fans. I am writing this just as they have brought out \\"Deftones\\" their new album. Its brilliant but it has a lot to live up to if it is to be as good as this. This album is ripping, gripping and downright tripping hard rock music. From the start when you get the deep almost evil opening riff of \\"My Own Summer(Shove It)\\" you get the impression that this is gunna be one of your angry days. Then your on to the heavy riff of Ihabia and the Evil and Deep Mascara....with Chino's deep and whispery voice followed by the amazing chorus. He really sings like he means it. Track 4..Around the Fur...title track...i cannot talk this song up more....its incredibly....The drum beat at the start followed by the deep guitaring with Chinos sarcastic, sloppy singing that we love soo much. Screaming the chorus out, spitting it out of his mouth.  Then Rickets...wow...heavy assed tune. Followed by Be Quiet And Drive (far away) the chords at the start is the perfect start to the perfect song. Genius Deftones...pure Genius
B000002OX7|5.0|This is my favorite album of all time, and I don't think it'd be a gigantic stretch to call it the best album ever made.  With this masterpiece, The Who became the first band to make a real artform out of the use of the synthesizer.  Listening to Baba O'Riley and Won't Get Fooled Again, one hears the synthesizer as a real instrument, not some toy.  Between those tracks are seven great rock tunes, from the (to me) deeply personal Behind Blue Eyes to Entwistle's amusing romp of My Wife to the hard rock standard Bargain.  The icing on this remaster is that the additional tracks actually add to the album.  Instead of being mere excuses for adding to the pricetag, the added tracks are incredible, especially the first five.  Pete Townshend accomplishes something that no one else ever has.  He crafts emotional music seemingly from purely intellectual inspiration.  And everything he dreamed up except the show to follow Tommy came out right in this masterwork.  From the inspiratinal three chord riff of Baba underscored by the synthesizer to Roger Daltrey's shriek during Won't, there isn't a dull moment.  I bought it as a sixteen-year-old simply for track 1, but I let it play through.  After hearing it all, I have NEVER stopped it midstride in five years of listening.
B00008H2LB|2.0|LP's new cd is a Hybrid Theory 2, dare I say with slicker production? <BR>Clocking in at only about 37 minutes is the first disappointment, and you can't judge an album by its length but when you wait 2 years for a cd with 13 songs you expect it to be a little longer. <BR>The album seeming like a giant loop is the second disappointment. All the songs seem to sound the same: the same riffs, vocals ect. A couple songs stand out, like &quot;Nobody's Listening&quot; which uses a Japanese instrument to give it a unique sound, &quot;Somewhere I Belong&quot; sounds a little different with some nice guitar at the start and &quot;Session&quot; (an instrumental track) provides a nice break. But the album does get repetative after a while, however since it's only 37 minutes it's over quickly.<BR>The third disappointment is that Chester's role seems to have been downsized. Apparently he was sick during the recording but if it takes you 2 years to make an album I'm sure they could wait until he was better. Out of the two Chester seems like the better vocalist and not hearing him as much was a let down.<BR>I'd recommend going out and getting Hybrid Theory over this or for those not too into the rap/pop sound of LP but the technical/&quot;darker&quot; side White Pony by the Deftones.

If you like BOC and have seen them in concert, you must hear and probably own this cd. It is the next best thing to being there. (I do miss the laser light show). Great stuff. Give it a listen.
0385504209|5.0|I work part time at Borders Books and had an opportunity to read an advance copy.  What a joy!  I love thrillers, art history and history in general.  This one has got believable characters, a great meshing of multiple plotlines, and a couple of nice surprises at the end.<br />Thoroughly enjoyable.  I've been recommending it to Borders customers ever since.
B00005JLRT|4.0|I am a huge fan of everything Star Trek and this movie is no exception.  It didn't get great reviews but I sure liked it.  It has a new enemy and a slick new enemy ship.  I liked the marriage between Troi and Riker.   The story is similar to the story of Star Trek II - The Wrath of Khan but since, in my opinion, that was the best Trek film ever, they picked a good one to emulate.<br />Bottom line is, it could have been a bit more original, but it is one heck of a ride!
6304936362|4.0|After watching this fine film, the viewer will have a much clearer idea of what the young men of the World War II generation went through in order to defeat Nazi Germany.  It is true that there a things shown that are not accurate such as the banter between the crew during the mission and the altercation between two gunners at the time of greatest danger from enemy fighters.  However, enough things are shown correctly for the viewer to get an idea what it was like to fly these dangerous bombing missions over Germany.  Some of these things are the claustrophic, harsh conditions inside the aircraft, the danger from flak and enemy fighters, the problem of sighting the target and getting the bombs on it, the fatalism (or dread) of the aircrew, the boredom and tension between missions, the dedication of the pilot and bombardier in carrying out the mission successfully, the hard work and difficult conditions of the ground crews who serviced the aircraft, the emotional attachment of the crews to their aircraft, the terrible difficulties of the commanders in dealing with the casualties and demands of headquarters, the dangers of formation flying, etc, etc.  I could go on and on.  Get this film and see what I mean!
0446608955|5.0|I must admit, I usually hate loves stoies and romance novels.   But A walk to remember is one of my favorite books.  It's one of the most beautiful stories I have ever read. It had me laughing and crying the whole way through.  You will instantly fall in love with Jamie Sullivan's charitor.  I was so excited when it was made into a movie.  I even went to see it with a friend the day after it was released.  I was very disapointed, to say the leaste.  A wonderful book was turned into a shallow teen movie.  So much is changed that it barley seemd like it was still A walk to remember i was watching.<BR> So my advice: Read the book.  Skip the movie
B00008DDHZ|4.0|This film truly succeeds as cinema verite: the acting is quite amazing in bringing you into the experience as authentic, quite viscerally.  My appreciation of actor James Nesbitt is expanded, having really enjoyed him in the TV Drama &quot;Cold Feet&quot;, an entirely different role (a UK &quot;Friends&quot; and then some.  But Nesbitt is merely the most visible in an excellent cast overall.<BR>  <BR>   As with all cinema verite, the viewer should not be deceived into thinking that the experience is true and unbiased-- it is indeed a tale told from one side of the controversy.  Still the effort at impartiality by revealing flaws on both Irish and British parts contribute greatly to the believability of the film.  Unruly Irish hooligans provoke break ranks with peaceful marchers and provoke British troops; IRA are in the wings ready to exploit any opportunity from this peaceful demonstration.  The Brits are not monolithic bad guys; you have a sense of some trying to do the right thing, and an understanding, if not empathy, with how the dynamics of the situation could contribute tragic consequences.<br />   If you enjoyed this, also have a look at &quot;In the Name of the Father&quot; with Daniel Day-Lewis and Pete Postlethwaite.
B000007XUQ|5.0|As many reviewers have already stated, this is the one and only Christmas collection that you need!  Many of the classics are covered, and beautifully i might add, by the most talented vocal artist of the twentieth century, Karen Carpenter.  Richard Carpenter is a master at composing ballads and tunes that allow Karen to find the essetial core of a song, and seemingly sing it just to you.  Especially fun is &quot;What are you doing New Year's Eve&quot; on the second disc, a playful and sly number that is a hidden treasure in the midst of more traditional Christmas carols.  Unforgettable as well is the perennial favourite, &quot;Merry Christmas Darling,&quot; which utilizes Karen's deep and haunting voice to lure and enchant its listeners.  From beginning to end, The Carpenters' Christmas Collection is a profoundly powerful album, not only for the holiday season, but for any time of the year.  We miss you, Karen.
B00005AR3G|5.0|This is a story of a spoiled brat that you love to laugh at because of all the crazy mistakes he makes.  I never get tired of watching this movie with my son.  My husband even watches this one without the ever common &quot;Not this again!&quot;  The supporting characters make this movie.  The one liners are great even after watching a few dozen times.
B000002UVX|5.0|This show occurred Dec.31, 1969.  This recording was made on the last evening of the 1960's, ending a exciting turbulent time in the USA.  I was originally given \\"Band of Gypsys\\" on cassette at Christmas 1970.  I played it until it wore out.  Every single cut on this CD is spectacular.  Drummer Buddy Miles being on this recording makes it historical.  This was the first time I heard \\"Them Changes\\", with Buddy doing the lead vocals.  I love the part on this CD when Jimi wishes everybody \\"a happy new year\\" and then he sends wishes to all the soldiers in Vietnam.(Jimi was a paratrooper in the U.S. Army)<br />Hearing this CD reminds me of flower children, Woodstock, bell bottom jeans, Afros....oh wait!...the kids now are wearing these fashions.<br />\\"Band of Gyspys\\" is a timeless, profound piece of music history!
0316666343|5.0|Why should you read this book? In my opinion, Alice Sebold's &quot;The Lovely Bones&quot; is one of the most uniquely presented and creatively written fiction stories to come out in many years. The only others in the same category, that I liked, are the &quot;Harry Potter&quot; books, in fiction, and, &quot;West Point: Character Leadership...Thomas Jefferson&quot;, in creative nonfiction. If you would like an unusual experience, don't miss reading Ms. Sebold's great book, or the others I have mentioned, for that matter. They are all affairs to remember.
B000089RVX|5.0|Who cares if they have a sound that is similar to Likin Park. I like them as well. This band and their lead singer has a way of making you pay attention not only to the music but the lyrics.<BR>I highly recommend this CD if you don't have it yet!<br />I love the song &quot; Bring me to life&quot; I haven't seen Daredevil so I honestly had no idea that the song was in or part of the movie. I live in Europe and we see a lot of new bands here on MTV before those in the states see them. <br />I am as impressed with this band as I am the Guano Apes. New sounds are making their way to music and it is extremely refreshing to hear new bands breaking through.

B00005OAIE|4.0|What I mean by that is if you buy cd's for their singles, then this is a good one to get. It's just like &quot;Your Body Is A Wonderland&quot; and &quot;No Such Thing&quot;. Some of the songs are more acustic, but that's not always bad. John Mayer has a excellent voice and range. To sum up, this is a good album.
B00006RU5B|2.0|It's always good to see Chris performing,but this project is a big retrocess in his career. I thought that with Euphoria he was making some progress...but he has returned to his roots,just rock.<BR>Buy this if you wanna headbang a little, or &quot;amaze at the great lyrics&quot;...<BR>I reccomend you go get Ultramega OK.
B00008G9JO|4.0|Songs like No Lullaby, Rover and One Brown Mouse make this CD worth while!!
B00006879E|5.0|I first heard this band when they opened for Matchbox Twenty and Sugar Ray and these guys should be headlining their own tour! This CD is amazin. I can't quite describe the style of music because it's so different than anything I've ever heard before. &quot;This Love&quot; is my favorite song on the CD, but the rest of the songs are equally as incredible. GO OUT AND GET THIS CD!! You'll be glad you did!
B00004Z459|5.0|I just LOVE this CD! It lets out a TON of my anger when I listen to it. Even if I'm not mad, I feel better. You can just feel the pain that the person they're talking about caused them.
B000084T18|5.0|Ok I don't know what any of these people are talking about...Myself, along with everyone I know loves this CD. Anyway I think it has a lot of hella cool beats. I would recommend it to anyone who likes rap, this is definitley not for [weaklings].
B000002JSH|5.0|This album is as good as their first one, which gained them masive popularity right from the begginning, and in my humble opinion, 'Straight shooter' is even better than 'Bad Co'. And that means it is their best record. There aren't any weak songs on this album, as some revewers have pointed out - anyone who knows what great rock and roll/hard rock is, will say that those statements are just bunch of c**p.<BR>Ok, maybe lyrics aren't too strong allways (example, 'Anna'), but music is pure, 100%, straight-on rock, and it is hard /rock/ indeed. 'Good lovin' gone bad', 'Feel like makin love', 'Shooting star', 'Deal with the preacher' and 'Wild fire woman' are fine example of that. Other songs are great, too. The riff from 'Feel like makin love' may be stollen from The Who, but who cares! It is one of the greatest rock songs/ballads ever written. What a power during refrains! My personal favorite is 'Shooting star', and it is one of the greatest rock songs ever, too. Music is perfect, and lyrics are, simply put, tale-story masterpice. It's telling us abuot rock'n'roll ideals and song is allegoric story about rock star. That na-na-na vocals at the end of the song makes me cry every time I hear it. And solo is great touch, just superb.<BR>Paul Rodgers always delivers some of the greatest and most emotional vocals in rock music, and here is, ofcourse, in great form. So, this is not only hard rock, is very emotional and solful music, preformed by great musitians. Hey, they were supergroup!<br />Anyway, this is a must for any rock fun. Just turn it up, and let it inside you. And when first tune begins, you can start to dance, or jump, or whatever you want..<br />AND COME ON JOHNNY, SING US A SONG ONE MORE TIME!
B0000062Y2|3.0|First off, the original jesus in this show was IAN GILLAN not Ted Neally.Take JUDAS &amp; SIMON from the film and place them in the original london cast and there you have the best JESUS CHRIST SUPERSTAR.However these two from the film don't make this one worth buying.
B000069HKH|4.0|Even though I like all those old 80s songs that he made (like &quot;Born in the USA&quot;) I think this album has even better songs. I like how he dedicated a whole album (this one) to the people of 9/11. It was a terrible thing that happened to the USA and it was very kind of him to dedicate an album to the victim's families and the victims themselves.
B00008O0WN|3.0|I enjoyed the movie mostly because I'm a die hard Next Generation fan. I've always enjoyed the personalities and interactions of the characters. But in this movie I was very disappointed.  The long awaited wedding and \\"honeymoon\\" between Troi and Riker was missing chemistry, passion, and love. I wasn't over joyed with Picard or Data either as they seemed \\"out of character\\". The other characters also seemed displaced. I'm not sure if the problem was the actors, director, story line, or all of the above.  That said... I still plan to watch it again on DVD.
0393057658|5.0|This is an excellent read if your a fan of baseball or not. Lewis takes you into the most successful small market franchise in the majors and shows you how it runs.  That is ofcourse for the baseball fan, but Lewis also gives the average reader something to read this book for.  A look into the phsyce of one of the most intense men in baseball.  An excellent investment of both your money and your time.
B000083E79|5.0|GREAT COMPILATION OF SOME OF HER CLASSIC TUNES,BUT MANY HUGE HITS ARE MISSING...GUESS WE'LL HAVE TO WAIT FOR THE BOX SET IN THE FUTURE.
B00005YW4H|5.0|I bought this CD for one song, and I ended up loving the entire thing!  Norah Jones has a smooth, mellow voice that is great on the original songs and definitely does justice to the covers.  I'd recommend it to anyone who likes to sing along in the car or just relax and listen to music at home.
B00005JLXE|1.0|Can someone please explain to me why the heck think this is a good movie.<BR>It has absolutely no story.  You can't tell what is going on in any of the fight scenes.  It's so dark.  Plus, how much can it possibly rain in this movie!!!  Plus Affleck is the worst blind man ever.  Why doesn't elektra question the fact that ben keeps stop her from crossing the street and having an elaborate kung fu battle on seesaws in plain view of everyone.  The point of Daredevil's secret identity was to pretend he was blind so no one knew he was daredevil.  Plus he was around with the same stick he fights crime with.  Worst blind man ever!  The only enjoyable part of the film was Colin Farell's over the top performance as Bullseye (point to bullseye on head then repeatedly say bullseye)  I just fail to see what's so entertaining about this film.  Please if someone can explain it to me do so.  But I urge you not to waste your money on this film or it's inevitable sequels.
B000065V9Y|5.0|Yes, it's true. \\"Us,\\" for the most part, lacks songs like the radio-conscience-but-still-good \\"Sledgehammer,\\" but that's the appeal and magic. I bought this disc in 1998 and was surprised that people were so hard on \\"Us\\" when it premiered in 1992. I like the darker, dirtier and less-poppy production that emerges from the speakers when \\"Us\\" plays. \\"So\\" is a great album, but I wouldn't say songs like \\"Big Time\\" are definitive Gabriel material. \\"Us\\" has songs that are more in the \\"Melting Face\\" style of Peter's work. The moody, soul-searching of \\"Secret World,\\" the soothing melody of \\"Blood of Eden,\\" the bagpipe-driven \\"Come Talk To Me\\" and the gritty, sinister-sounding \\"Digging In The Dirt\\" are first-rate tracks. Don't be fooled by the allegations that the former Genesis singer was uninspired when the studio tapes rolled during the recording of \\"Us.\\" Gabriel's vocals on the LP expose his wide range of emotions and thoughts like a raw nerve. It's a wonderful album that holds up so much better in sound and content than Nirvana's \\"Nevermind,\\" which came out the same year. Put \\"Sledgehammer\\" out of your mind, sit down and give \\"Us\\" a spin. It's the very least this excellent document of Gabriel's heartbreak and eventual, fearful recovery from spiritual loss deserves. Those who have ever gone through a divorce - Gabriel did during the writing of the CD - will know exactly where's he coming from.
B00007LTIG|3.0|This remastered version of the Dead's first album really bring the music to life.  Both the packaging and sound are great. Bonus matieral is interesting. This first album was more of promise of what was to come rather then the full flowering of what this band would be within two years.  Some of the songs sound hesitant which can be expected for a first effort.<BR>Morning Dew alone is worth the price of admission!
B00006L7XQ|4.0|Man, I was glad when Johnny Cash got out of the hospital.  I've been saying for years that it will be a bona fide National Day of Mourning when he passes on.  Now, he must face life without his soul mate. His faith has sustained him and his pain sustains us.<br /> I admit to raw chills when NIN's \\"Hurt\\" came on. \\"Knowing is a dangerous drug\\", somebody said once.  In this case, knowing that Trent's anger found expression through the Soul of A Warrior Priest caused legitimate tears to flow.  I probably was crying the most for Johnny's loss of his beloved.  I just hope he wants to stick around a bit longer because there are just so many songs I want him to rescue from the infidels.<br /> Honestly, I'd been waiting for his rendition of Hank Williams' \\"I'm so lonesome, I could cry\\" with Nick Cave.  It was the  primary reason I wanted to hear *The Man Comes Around*.  On Solitary Man, his cover of Nick Cave and the Bad Seeds' \\"Mercy Seat\\" weighs down with the urgency of imminent death while maintaining a grace that few men shall ever know.  Sort of like Johnny, himself.<br />Overall, it is difficult to put into any kind of coherent language what Johnny Cash means to this Country. What he means to anyone who lives in the Spirit and not in accordance to the evil of Mammon.  This Man is a Saint; I don't need a Pope to canonize him.  I canonize him My Self.  The closest living thing to holiness.  If every Christian was like Johnny Cash, I would actually consider heaven in my future vacation plans.  Regardless, these songs all convey various aspects of the malignency of existence.  Johnny has written a testament to suffering and the elusiveness of redemption.  We should thank him for it.  I say, why wait till he is gone to honour him. We ought to Have a Johnny Cash Day right now!!!
B000001Y42|5.0|Limp Bizkits latter releases, Significant Other and Chocolate Starfish, have become nothing compared to this debut album.  The songs here are almost all good; as they offer a perfect mix between noble lyrics and rap-metal sound.  Other reviewers think Dursts lyrics are weak and foolhardy.  But if you really listen to the music youll be (at least) mildly impressed.  Even though Faith helped boost sales for the CD, its not the only good song.  In fact, its very different compared with the other tracks and their sound.  Notwithstanding, there are a few ineffectual (not bad) tracks on Three Dollar Bill Yall.  And even with those few choice tracks, the fact that the album is much better than their next two make it a definite must-have.  With that, heres an overview of the 13 songs:<br />1. Intro - ?/5 - of Limp Bizkits two other intros (and outros), this is probably the best.  Still, its only an introduction.<br />2. Pollution - 4.5/5 - this is really an amazing song.  Everything with it is awesome: the words, the sound, its all good.  The only thing that keeps it from being perfect is the end.  The way Fred shouts back over and over becomes a little annoying.  Even so that was probably intended.<br />3. Counterfeit - 5/5 - in all likelihood, this is LBs best song.  Its their most well-rounded anyways.  The chorus, you figured me out / you wear a mask / cold counterfeit / you figured me out / you were a... fake, is great.  You wont find words like that anymore.<br />4. Stuck - 5/5 - this could also be considered the bands best song.  But I think its variations in lyrics and music make it hard for some people to like.  However, the lyrics are awesome; to the point of almost hilarious.  This is probably my favorite track on the CD.<br />5. Nobody Loves Me - 3.5/5 - again, the ending takes away from the impressiveness this track has to offer.  I love the you think youre better than me? / you suck! climactic scream and shut up beginning.  But the quiet, no-rock end makes it weak.<br />6. Sour - 4/5 - this track represents the most rap on Three Dollar Bill Yall.  And thats okay.  Had they tried to reproduce this track a few times, it mightve become unpleasant.  Nevertheless it easily stands out as a hidden gem.<br />7. Stalemate - 3/5 - the slow start probably takes away from the fact that Stalemate is a pretty good song.  Freds voice does become a bit annoying, but thats mostly because the background music is too repetitive.  The end here is a relief.<br />8. Clunk - 3.5/5 - this track is slightly better than the last, but it doesnt quite balance with some of the previous songs.  The lyrics are excellent and the mid-part (almost) spoken by Fred is, believe it or not, enjoyable.  And again, the end couldve been better.<br />9. Faith - 5/5 - despite what many people think, this is not a Limp Bizkit song.  Its actually a George Michael cover (thats right, George Michael).  But the twist of rock and rap changes it so much that it becomes a Limp Bizkit classic and a recognized fan-favorite.<br />10. Stink Finger - 3/5 - although this track is pretty original and as rockin as it gets for LB, its rather average compared to either Counterfeit or even Sour.  It might be, along with track seven, the weakest track on the album.<br />11. Indigo Flow - 4/5 - I actually like this song.  Its basically a shout-out to everyone and everything that influenced the band; including the Deftones, drinking, Fear Factory, Korn, and of course... God.  Without the turntable ending it wouldve been nothing.<br />12. Leech - 5/5 - this is the definitive hidden gem on Three Dollar Bill Yall.  Although it is said to be a demo version, it is just as good and even better than a few of the CDs other tracks.  If it was more than just two minutes it mightve been more accepted.<br />13. Everything - 3.5/5 - this 16-minute closer doesnt really finish out the album with a loud bang, but its a bang nonetheless.  The lyrics are amazing and the music is unlike anything else on the disc.  Its kind of slow (and long); which might be why it isnt so prominent.<br />Unlike Limp Bizkits other two CDs, this one does not have a true bad song.  And in my opinion, Three Dollar Bill Yall has their three best songs of all-time: Counterfeit, Stuck, and yes, Faith.  The lyrics are perfectly unique throughout; and their sound is at the top of its game.  Even though their next two releases have been depressingly short of good (compared to this one), these 13 tracks can easily make up for that if you are a fan.  I could probably give this album 4 stars and still feel like Id done the band justice.  But since theres too many people who dont understand and/or comprehend Limp Bizkit, Ill give it five.  This is, undoubtedly, THE place to start if you are looking to become a Limp Bizkit fan.  And if you consider yourself a LB fan (already) and you dont own this recording, buy it.esnt really finish out the album with a loud bang, but its a bang nonetheless.

B00005QG9J|5.0|Not that i don't love fungus amongus and science...But Incubus has come a long way.  Brandon's Voice has gotten 100x better and instrumentally, you can tell that the band has matured.  Some say incubus is selling out. I think that they are moving in a new direction, which isn't that much of a surprise.  There is quite a big between all of their albums, not just morning view.  Fungus was all funk.  SCIENCE was more thrashy, hip hop, metal.  Make Yourself was pure rock. And i would say that morning view is a good mix of rock, and somewhat \\"mellow, creative, southern california surfer music\\"  I think that morning view is their best album.  Every one of their cd's is completely different from the rest, but they are all INCREDIBLY good. If incubus never changed, i think we would get bored of listening to just funk all day (not that i have anything against fungus amongus or funk music in general). it's just awsome to see a band that can play more than just one kind of music. i'm going to review the songs on this album....<BR>1. Nice to know you - A good opening to the album. It has softer, syncopated verses, and a harder chorus that makes you want to dance. (well, maybe not)<BR>2. Circles - One of the harder songs of this album...this song probably would fit well on the make yourself album. a good rock song.<BR>3. Wish You were here -i heard the world premiere of this song on kroq (the l.a. radio station). I have loved it ever since. In this song, you can tell that incubus likes the beach. it has a good mellody.<BR>4.  Just a phase - One of my personal favorites from this cd. It has intelligent lyrics, and a good feel.  Kilmore did a great job. and the chorus at the end just rocks out.<BR>5. 11 am -mike's guitar sounds awsome on this song. This song is one of the slower ones. it's very good though. <BR>6. Blood on the ground - brandon called this \\"an angry song\\". it's pretty angry, but it has a really good feel. it's a rad song. one of the harder songs on this cd.<br />7.Mexico -a very slow, but very sweet song. i play it on my guitar all the time. it's rad. <BR>8. Warning - this song is average to me. i really liked it at first, but i've heard it alot. it's still a good song. has a positive message and an overall positive vibe.<BR>9. Echo -slower. has somewhat of a \\"stellar\\" feel to it, except it doesn't turn harder during the chorus. it's a nice love song.<BR>10. Have You Ever -a harder, edgier song, very good, sounds like the incubus i love<BR>11. Are you in? - an interesting song from incubus. doesn't sound like the rest of their stuff...but that's why i love this band. good bass line. creative. good. <BR>12. Under My Umbrella - one of my favorites on this cd. it's dark/hard, edgy. VERY GOOD.<BR>13. Aqueous Transmission - Whoah. one word- CREATIVE. amazing. it's one of my favorite incubus songs ever.<br />BUY THIS ALBUM!!!!
B000089RVX|4.0|I bought this CD on a recommendation from a very good friend of mine who told me that as a female singer, I should check it out.<br />At first listen, I was impressed with the minor chords &amp; haunting melodies, but felt like the songs ran onto one another.  But here's the thing: on subsequent listenings, I didn't mind that aspect of it so much.  Very few CDs out there are put together as full works - just random songs strewn together.  This one just flows.  She's got an amazing voice - the texture of it is beautiful in a pleading horror movie heroine sort of way.  I enjoyed that the songs aren't your typical verse, verse, chorus, verse, bridge, chorus &amp; that they move very well considering the hard edge it has.  It's a great mix of smooth vocals with dark rhythm.<br />As for comparisons, who cares?  I enjoy this album for what it is, not because she sounds like somebody else or that the instrumentals play like another band.  I don't judge it by being &quot;goth&quot; or whatever other trendy title you want to stamp on it.  It's a good CD any way around it &amp; I'm happy I have it in my collection.

B00003CXS4|5.0|The first time I saw this movie I hated it.  I later decided to give it a chance and loved it.  I think you have to see the movie a couple of times to really follow and be able to understand the accents in the movie.  Brad Pitt plays a great role.  Jason Statham and Vinne Jones also make this movie a definite to watch again and again.  I would definitely buy this DVD if I was considering it.
B00005QAPH|5.0|As soon as I saw E ½E I fell in love with it. Possibly it was because I completely related to the main character's pain of being trapped in a reality that made him paranoid, or that every problem that he had would topple down his other problems like dominoes, pressure from the people who surrounded him, personal and professional alike. Or maybe since it was directed and written by Fellini. In any way, this vision only Fellini could take on, a director who had no idea how to finish his own film, with his personal struggles surrounding him at the same time, was destined to be the film that Fellini should be remembered for. You may want to scream at yourself after watching this film. But do you exactly know why?<br />Criterion put together the ultimate package for E ½E supplements galore. Commentary is fun for the enthusiasts, along with Terry Gilliam's intro. But all the fun to me lies in the autobiographical film that Fellini made for television. Just sit back and watch this after the movie. You'll see what I mean by it. Or maybe you won't. The documentary on the amazing Nina Rota from German television is also included, the composer behind many of his films, possibly this one being the most memorable of his film scores. They also held back at nothing and included many essays for the booklet inside, which I still have no idea why other companies feel this is not a `supplementE If you don't own any of Fellini's films on DVD, this is the one to start off with. This has the best extras of any out there.<br />On a side note, the audio seemed to be slightly off, but it might be a defect on my copy, I haven't seen anything on Criterion's website that says anything about it.<br />Best shot/sequence:<BR>With Criterion remastering every frame, it's hard to pick out the best of the best. But the opening dream sequence when Guido is stuck in traffic and floats away is still far and away one of the greatest dream sequences ever made, with subtle uses of freeze framing, dissolves, and telephoto lenses. I especially love the old man caressing the younger woman in the other car. Strange, but very much part of the dream that has to be seen to understand.
B00000JGEH|3.0|I saw this movie for the first time back in 1987 (3 years after it came out), and I was blown away by the special effects and all that.  But I look at it now, and I can tell how old it is.  If you watch Terminator 2 before this, DO NOT expect this to be as good as part 2.  Terminator 2 is alot better than this one, and the special effects look clean even 12 years later.  Still, its a must see for all Terminator fans.
B00004ZAV3|3.0|A good collection because it has NOTHING from Sgt. Pepper or the The White Album either.<br />Most of the songs are from the early days, which is good.
B000000H5K|5.0|First of all, if you came to check out this album looking for some old school Thrash/Speed-ish Sepultura you can hit the Return Button of your browser right now.<BR>I wouldn't want to categorize this album as Nü-Metal, especially since i don't really know what Nü-Metal is supposed to be. In one simple word, this album is CREATIVITY.<br />Some people might call this album a total sell-out, mostly given the fact that this is a One of a kind album from the jungle boys, It's just Sepultura knew they had to grow up, in fact they knew when they first started recording Arise.<br />This is something really different, yet really Really REALLY (Did I say really?) ...good.<br />My personal favorite tracks on this album:<br />- Cut-Throat [My personal fav Sepultura song]<BR>- Dusted [Awesome song, very good, the start's very good]<BR>- Attitude [Kind of tribal but very heavy]<BR>- Straighthate [A Slow yet powerful track]<BR>- Born Stubborn [Now this is a powerful/fast song (Compared to the other ones on the album), another one of my all times favorite]<BR>- Roots Bloody Roots [This song introduced me to Sepultura, feels kinda repetitive to me but still, very good]<BR>- Breed Apart [No words. Plain awesome]<BR>- Ratamahatta [Awesome mix of tribal & metal sounds, very very good song]<BR>- Ambush [This song takes you by surprise, love the drum work on this track]
B000000OQF|5.0|Has there ever been a better rock song than &quot;Sweet Child&quot;?  No.<br />If you only own one G&amp;R album, this should be it.  I kicked the Beatles' &quot;Rubber Soul&quot; out of the CD player for this one.
1573229725|5.0|What a fabulous book!  I gasped like a girl at all the plot twists and could not put it down until the last page.  If I could get one wish, it would be to read this novel again without knowing how it turns out.  Excellent, excellent read!
B00004TWZK|3.0|Four boys in a small town in Oregon set out to find a dead body of a kid who was killed quite a while before. On thier adventure, they discover something that they never knew existed. That is thier extreme friendship. They all help each other out in this movie. It's deffinetly not my favorite movie, but if your looking for a film to see because you can't find any others. I'd try this movie.
B0000057C5|4.0|I'm not even sure how to begin describing Rammstein's SEHNSUCHT.  \\"Loud\\" would probably be a good start.<br />The sounds on this CD are what you would get if you put a metal band, a techno album, a cheesy 80's horror movie soundtrack and a drunken German opera singer into a Markov Chain generator, and then let the result go out on tour to light bits of itself on fire.  \\"Sehnsucht\\" itself is an old German word (dating way back to 1998 A.D.) meaning \\"type of music your neighbors hate and that the elderly give you dirty looks on the streets for\\".<br />No, seriously, while I did take German for several semesters in high school and college, I can only understand the basics of these lyrics; a lot of it simply flies loudly over my head.  I attribute this, not to the fact that I had no talent at picking up languages, but more because none of my coursework featured a section on learning S&M vocabulary.  If you don't speak German, don't worry about it.  Half the fun is trying to sing along in a foreign tongue.  I doubt they're talking about puppies, kittens and flowers though.<br />The music, apart from being a combination of the elements I mentioned, can be rather catchy at times.  The beats are often hypnotizing, and the (loud) guitar riffs are quite powerful.  The overbearing synthesizers and keyboards can sound incredibly goofy at times, but somehow that just adds to the appeal.  There is a definite industrial flavor, so fans of that style will find much to enjoy here.<br />SEHNSUCHT gets better every time I listen to it.  It manages to be so over the top that it is virtually impossible to take seriously.  But that doesn't matter, because it's so much fun.  It's great music that gets the blood pumping and the body dancing. <br />(Note that there is available a more expensive release of this album that features two bonus tracks.  They are just English translations of \\"Engel\\" and \\"Du Hast\\".  I wouldn't pay a significant amount of money just for these two extras; the original German versions sound better anyway.)
B00008LDPU|2.0|When they say this DVD contains considerable violence and grotesque imagery they aren't kidding. If the Matrix had been anything more than an action movie I might bother to discuss the social ramifications of its themes and the legitimacy of art expression, but I will keep this a review of this DVD.<BR>I enjoy anime, but I am one of those who does not think sanitized should be a pejorative term.<BR>The violence against women (or pseudowomen, in certain incidents) disturbed me but the rending of screaming people was reckless disregard for taste. I cannot in good conscience recommend this DVD as a whole. <BR>The idea behind telling the back story was innovative, but the execution was gruesome.<br />The good points (i.e. why it should get any stars):<BR>The behind the scenes are intriguing. <BR>The \\"Scrolls to Screen: The History and Culture of Anime\\" documentary was a pleasant, if mundane, introduction to the history of anime. Nevertheless, it may help those inspired by the Matrix to understand why the Wachowski brothers were inspired by anime.<BR>\\"Program\\" is Yoshiaki Kawajiri at his finest. I am impressed at the character interaction, and the inscrutable integration of the Matrix design into a compelling short. I am likewise impressed at his restraint. The action is intense but it is not gratuitous (like in The Second Renaissance). At the heart of the action is the testing of a woman's love and her dedication to freedom. <BR>If you cannot content yourself with downloading the free version of Program then get the DVD. But, I must say, I was sorely disappointed with the rest of the features.<BR>Watch your friend's copy and you'll get what you pay for.
B00007KWHO|4.0|\\"Time And A Word\\" (released in 1970) was The Yes' second album and in my opinion was a better album then their debut. It clearly shows the group experimenting with different sounds. Just listen to \\"No Opportunity Necessary, No Experience Needed\\" and \\"Clear Days\\" which utilize an orchestra. There are some great songs on this cd beginning with the above mentioned song \\"No Opportunity Needed...\\", \\"Then\\", \\"Sweet Dreams\\", and \\"Astral Traveller\\". Granted this album isn't as great as \\"Fragile\\" or \\"Close To The Edge\\", but then again they didn't have Steve Howe or Rick Wakeman. Interestingly, Howe appears on the cover of the U.S. release of \\"Time And A Word\\" but doesn't play on it. It wasn't until the next album \\"The Yes Album\\" (released in 1971) , that Howe replaced Peter Banks as guitarist. And Tony Kaye was later replaced by keyboard wizard extroardinaire, Wakeman. There are four bonus tracks included in this newly remastered cd. 1) Dear Father, 2) No Opportunity Necessary, No Experience Needed (Original Mix), 3) Sweet Dreams (Original Mix), 4) The Prophet (Single Version), all of which are a nice addition to the regular album song listing. The sound quality of this cd is much better than the previous Joe Gastwirt remasters which had no punch. This version has more bottom end, increased midrange and pumped up output level. There's also an eight page booklet included that has some colorful pictures of the group and lyrics to the songs. This is a must for all Yes fans or those who enjoy listening to seventies progressive rock such as Emerson, Lake & palmer, King Crimson, or Genesis.
B00000ILDE|5.0|\\"In Space Nobody Can Hear You Scream\\" was the slogan for the terrifying space-horror film \\"Alien\\".<br />The sequel, \\"Aliens\\" is nothing short of terrific. This film is nowhere near as horrifying as the original, instead, it is action-packed to the hilt. Director James Cameron, of Terminator fame, does an incredible job with special effects, story telling, and character development.<br />The story basically picks up exactly where we last saw Ripley, floating through space on the escape ship where she battled the Alien from the first film. Ripley is found by a deep salvage team, and returned back to a space station orbiting Earth. As it turns out, Ripley has been drifting in outer space for 58 years.<br />When Ripley destroyed the Nostromo in an effort to kill the Alien that slaughtered her entire crew, she cost the \\"company\\" millions of dollars, and upon her return, was stripped of her flight status. Burke, played by Paul Reiser, talks Ripley into joining a team of grunts in a military exercise to find a colony of people that were stationed on the Alien planet, and are now missing.<br />The action ensues from there, as the grunts set up post in the colony stronghold, only to encounter Alien attacks. After many losses, and the finding of Newt, the only apparent survivor of the colony, Ripley fights the Queen of the aliens in a battle sequence for the ages.<br />There are too many great things to say about this film. If you have never seen it, you have missed out on probably one of the best action films of all time. For a film made in 1986, it is definitely up to par with todays action films.
055357342X|1.0|Maybe I'd have given this two stars if I hadn't seen so many reviews comparing it favourably to Tolkien's Lord of the Rings. A Song of Ice and Fire started out well, but this last instalment seems to be going nowhere except downhill. Martin knows all the tricks, but I wonder what else he knows. This doesn't come anywhere near Tolkien - it's the conjurer's cheap tricks against the litterally wonderful magic of the wizard. <BR>I'm surprised so many people give it five stars, but I guess every book gets the readers it deserves.

B00003CWL6|3.0|With the video release of American Beauty, now you, too, can rent or own this subversive satire of the hypocrisy, Nazism, and homophobia lurking among the freshly cut lawns and orderly subdivisions of suburban civilization.<br />In American Beauty, an expert Hollywood eye shows an American neighborhood for what it really is: the miserable businesswoman putting on a phony, cheery face; the degraded husband who, suffering a midlife crisis, fantasizes about his daughter's girlfriend; the girlfriend, who brags of seducing older men; and best of all, the new neighbors, a retired Marine Corps colonel and his family. The homophobic colonel is of course a neo-Nazi and closet homosexual. Meanwhile, the one gay couple on the block is as sweet, decent, and tolerant as everyone else is screwed up, mean-spirited, and phony.<br />Bad enough, that director Sam Mendes and screenwriter/co-producer Alan Ball, presume to be telling \\"the truth\\" about suburbia, but they think they're doing director-screenwriter-producer Billy Wilder [alive in 2000, at the time of original publication] proud! They said so at the Oscars. This is clear, as well, through the gimmick, copied from Wilder's 1950 masterpiece, Sunset Boulevard, of the dead protagonist's (William Holden's Joe Gillis) opening and closing narration. Mendes and Ball aren't fit to carry Billy Wilder's director's chair. Indeed, today a young Billy Wilder would be satirizing them and their ilk.<br />Billy Wilder has never shown hatred toward the land that not only made him rich, but which saved the Viennese refugee from being turned into soap by his fellow Austrian, Hitler. And in contrast to the retired Marine Corps colonel on whom Mendes and Ball focus their hatred, see Wilder's affectionate portrait of America's fighting men in his Oscar-winning, 1953 movie, Stalag 17.<br />Wilder -- considered anything but subtle in his day -- wore silk gloves, in contrast to the hamhanded doings here. And though cynical, he didn't ooze superiorityover his characters. In Sunset Boulevard, for instance, Wilder depicted faded silent screen legend \\"Norma Desmond\\" (played by Gloria Swanson, herself a faded silent screen giant in a career-capping performance dripping in irony) as a monster, and yet, she was a monster for whom he clearly felt affection. Wilder, as screenwriter, gave Desmond the best line in the picture, which indicted the Hollywood of his time. When a police detective asks Desmond, \\"Didn't you used to be big in pictures?,\\" she responds, \\"I AM big. It's the pictures that got small.\\" They sure did.<br />Mendes and Ball confuse glibness and smugness with irony, with every character a mere prop in their anti-morality tale. They promote the adolescent notion that people are good, only to the degree that they do whatever they feel like at any given moment.<BR>And yet, the picture does have its funny moments, most of which involve Spacey, one of only two characters for whom Mendes and Ball feel any sympathy. The other character is a young, drug-dealing, peeping Tom -- but he's authentic! (The gay couple can't be counted: Their brief, superficial presence exists only to emphasize the evil of the homophobic colonel.) Much technical skill is in evidence. And the cast does marvelous work. Kevin Spacey, in particular, gives a performance for the ages, in this otherwise conventionally PC, Hollywood concoction.<br />American Beauty has two basic attitudes, each of which is anathema to Billy Wilder's work. 1. Political correctness. Wilder made a living skewering the sort of simple-minded notions that Mendes and Ball prize. 2. Authenticity: Younger fans of this film have said things like, \\"It'll change your life!\\" They saw the film as saying that most people walk around already dead, but don't know it yet. When protagonist Lester Burnham (Spacey) has an awakening, his life can never be the same.<br />But of course! In an Intro to Psychology lecture in 1978, wide-eyed with wonder, I heard about the philosophy thatswept across America, after The War. The brainchild of the German philosopher, Martin Heidegger (1889-1977), existentialism teaches the ethics of \\"authenticity,\\" of consciously living under the shadow of death, without religious evasions or \\"bad faith.\\" Existentialism's impassioned attack on hypocrisy, has always made it attractive to young people. And yet, its premise -- that life is led only in the face of mortality -- is philosophy's point of departure, not its destination.<BR>Had Ball and Mendes known anything about existentialism, they would have known that it is inseparable from ... Nazism!<BR>Martin Heidegger's philosophy of life was of a piece with his politics. Like other Nazis, he was disgusted by the hypocrisy of bourgeois life.<br />And then there is American Beauty's embrace of homosexuality, and insistence on an unholy trinity of Nazism, homophobia, and closet homosexuality.<br />One of the obscenities of revisionist, pc history is the assertion that the Nazis persecuted homosexuals, just as they did Jews. In fact, the second most powerful man in the Nazi Party, Ernst Roehm, was an open homosexual, as were all of his lieutenant/lovers. Roehm headed the Storm Troopers, who openly brutalized Jews and leftists. Among many Party members, Ernst Roehm was even more popular than the Fuehrer. That's why Hitler, in an infamous \\"night of the long knives,\\" had Roehm and his lieutenants murdered.<br />It is understandable that gay activists would want to grind the history of Nazi homosexuality, and those who would tell it, under their jackboots. But Billy Wilder knew all about Roehm and Heidegger.<br />Having grown up in suburbia, I know its problems all too well. And as a Jew who lived for five years in West Germany (1980-85), and once got his nose bashed in by an old Nazi, I know something about the problem of authenticity, too. But Mendes and Ball are strangers to such problems, their jaundiced movie a self-righteous exercise in bigotry and ignorance.<br />Ina just world, suburbanites would be able to make movies mocking Hollywood hypocrisy, say, \\"I Spend My Free Time and Influence Getting Murderers Paroled ... So They Can Kill Again!\\" Oops! That's not a movie; that's real life in Hollywood.
B00005JLEU|5.0|In yet another proof of Hiyao Miyazaki's genius at anime and story telling, the director creates a story written about one 10 year old for yet another, and demonstrates that we all are never immune to stories that come from the heart.  The story is layered, ostensibly the tale of young Chihiro, a whining, self-centered girl who finds herself catapulted into a magical world where her parents are turned into pigs.  However, Chihiro demonstrates she is far more than a clumsy unpleasant child, as events bring her into contact with the denizens of the spirit bathhouse where she must work until she can free her parents.<br />From everyone she meets, Haku the dragon magician, Lin the serving woman,  terrifying Yubaba, and all the others Chihiro discovers part of an important lesson in the value of determination and love.  Even from No Face, a lonely spirit who causes chaos, even though he really only wants to be cared about, there is much to absorb.  Funny, sad, frightening, and encouraging, the experience is something akin to looking into a chest full of gems.  Chihiro passes her tests, and the girl who walks away from the bathhouse is miles away from the one who arrived.<br />One of the remarkable things about 'Spirited Away' is that Hiyao Miyazaki has chosen to go well beyond the constraints of Japanese mythology is a setting where one would expect stories straight out of the Kojiki legends.  Instead, he spins out of universal cloth, borrowing from the stories of many heritages.  Right at the beginning, the magic that entraps Chihiro's parents echoes stories of human trips to Faerie, where on is ordered to 'never eat the food.'  Even more precious are his outright inventions such as No Face, Miyazaki's stand-in for himself.  Thus, the mythic appeal of the film touches roots everywhere, explaining much of its appeal.<br />On watching the film for the second time, I spent some time with the pause button studying the individual frames.  When you are moving with the action, it is difficult to pay attention to the artistic particulars.  When these stand revealed, the film's beauty is undeniable - thousands of frames of artistic gems.  Myazaki is known for his tight artistic control of all factors of production and his use of talented people.  'Spirited Away' sets a higher standard and never falls away from it.  It is no surprise that Walt Disney Studios went to great lengths to get the US rights for Miyazaki's films.  If you watch this once, be prepared to watch it many times.  If we are lucky, perhaps it will be 'Always with Us.'on, it is difficult to pay attention to the artistic particulars.

B000068PQ0|4.0|ok, so where to start. It's trippy, it's following in the footsteps of other story albums (ex. Tommy), you choke a couple times the first time you try to swallow it all at once and then you realize that your just supposed to let yourself marinate in it. For hours on end. So you do. Then you end up all pruny and for a couple days. But it's worth it. Ego tripping at the Gates of Hell was the radio friendly one, but it actaully gets all good and happy and harmonious towards the end. So, marinate.
B000007VCM|5.0|This album was a transitional piece for Rock n' Roll, bridging the gap between the loud and punkish music of the 70's, and that which came before it in the latter part of the 60's... It is also where the Cult came into their own, as a force to be reckoned with... Love set the stage for what was to come in a beautifully dark and poetic way. Even today, after 18 years the music still holds it's own against the wave of artificial comercial rock that has claimed the airwaves. So listen in and be prepared....
B00005YXZH|4.0|this album was attatched to every single music search that I did so i finally bought it expecting this absolute masterpiece of a thing, up there with Sgt. Pepper's and stuff. The first time i listened to it, I only liked the Heavy Metal Drummer. But then the more i listned to it the more i knew what to expect and i could be in the right mood for it. ONe thing that's really just buggin me is how so many people are putting down the electronic buzzing and hissing and humming noises, and it's true that this is not as album where you just listen to a few songs, you have to listen to the whole thing all the way through and then the electronic stuff fits into it's place.
B000002GLE|4.0|Sting's 1986 double live set \\"Bring on the Night\\" was an ambitious effort, considering that he had released only one album of solo material. Instead, he reworks many lesser, and obscure, Police tunes with his rock/jazz fusion backing band and produces a winner. Sting handles the vocals and guitar, with Omar Hakim on drums, Darryl Jones on bass, Kenny Kirkland on keyboards and Branford Marsalis on saxophone.<br />The disk starts with a twisty medley of \\"Bring on the Night/When the World is Running Down You Make the Best of What's Still Around.\\" It's a long title, and a long song, with outstanding vocals by Sting, excellent keyboard solo by Kirkland and a surprise rap by Marsalis.<br />\\"Consider Me Gone\\" is pretty similar to the studio version on \\"Dream of the Blue Turtles\\" but it sizzles live with a cool Pacific style jazz beat.<br />\\"Low Life\\" is an obscure Police tune not found on their regular issues, but on the \\"Message in a Box\\" set. Nice blues/jazz feel and dark lyrics.<br />\\"The Dream of the Blue Turtles/Demolition Man\\" features a jazz instrumental melded into smoking version of the \\"Ghost in the Machine\\" classic, with horns that are not quite as dissonant as the original, and a break-neck pace.<br />Disc 2 opens with another medley, this time \\"One World (Not Three)/ Love is the Seventh Wave\\" and a fantastic multi-vocal introduction. Both songs have similar themes of, well, the world kind of [isn't good], but there's a lot to enjoy, too. The melding of these tunes is seamless. Sting and his band put a lot of thought, and rehearsal, into reworking these tunes.<br />\\"Moon Over Bourbon Street\\" features Sting and his bass guitar, and a little haunting sax in the background. A tribute to Anne Rice's \\"Interview With the Vampire\\" and Sting finds a depth to his usually thin/reedy/raspy voice that is not usually heard.<br />\\"I Burn For You\\" is another obscure Police tune that builds to a powerful finale.<br />I'm not sure where \\"Another Day\\" came from, but there is some cool audience interaction. \\"Down So Long\\" features Sting showing some blues/jazz chops.<br />\\"Tea in the Sahara\\" closes out the set, trading the desert atmospherics of Andy Summers' studio version for Marsalis' saxophone.<br />Although Sting is the frontman here, he lets his backing group flash their instrumental chops, making this a very enjoyable collection.interaction. \\"Down So Long\\" features Sting showing some blues/jazz chops.<BR>\\"Tea in the Sahara\\" closes out the set, trading the desert atmospherics of Andy Summers' studio version for Marsalis' saxophone.<BR>Although Sting is the frontman here, he lets his backing group flash their instrumental chops, making this a very enjoyable collection.

All of the songs are good, but the album would've been better if Limp Bizkit would've put 2 extra songs instead of the dumb intro and outro. That was the only thing I hated about the album.

My favorites in the second CD are: \\"Can't C Me\\", \\"Shorty Wanna Be A Thug\\", \\"When We Ride\\", and \\"Picture Me Rollin\\". Both CD's are good, but the first one is better.I'm a big 2pac fan and have all his albums. I like all his albums, but this is the best one! I never have to skip 1 track when I put it on the car.

It definately has that new york/lower east side/village feel to it, all jangly guitars and (some) tough themes.  Sounds like she listened to a lot of Television, Voidoids etc. era music.<br />The ones I love: Good Fortune (not every day either, sometimes this is a skipped track), but the always always listen: Whore's Hustle and Hustlers Whore, You Said Something (the whole \\"on a roof top in Brooklyn..\\" I lived this song!), This is Love, We Float.  The other songs I could take 'em or leave 'em.  In fact, the You Said Something song is a brilliantine star in my book.  It's worth buying the CD for.<br />Get the twofer of this one and To Bring You My Love Amazon offers and you have the excellent and the almost excellent.

For me, the little danceable details didn't really grab me until a year into listening to it consistently.  The voice permutations I find distracting, and make some songs unlistenable for me.<br />This is not an easy, enjoyable CD, it's cathartic.  Definately worthwhile having in a collection, (the Sky Lit Up, Electric Light, The Garden, and title track, Is this Desire are particularly good) but get aquainted with her other stuff first I'd suggest.
0553103547|1.0|After participating in the growing expression of discontent over the direction of the Wheel of Time series, I noticed that many readers recommended this series as far superior. Unless it starts to become far superior (or even marginally so) in book 2, those recommendations were a gross exageration. Several other reviewers of this book called it a \\"soap opera.\\" Bullseye. It takes forever to develop the plot, the characters are shallow and in many cases, either perverse or simply stupid. If the size and number of further volumes in the series is any indication, it goes on and on and on and on. Perhaps the popularity of this series is explained by the general lack of quality in this genre in recent years. No one knows how to EFFICIENTLY develop characters and tell a story without killing an entire forrest. Of course, the pundits argue that this is necessary \\"plot development\\" and that the length is necessary because it is an \\"epic\\" fantasy. Look up \\"epic\\" sometime. Webster's defines an epic as a long poem in a dignified style, and cites examples such as The Illiad, The Odyssey, Beowulf, or Paradise Lost. This series is now longer than all of those classics COMBINED, plus The Hobbit and the Lord of the Rings trilogy. There are other differences. Not too many \\"epics\\" contain explicit desriptions of sexual acts that would be a felony in most states. They just aren't necessary to resolving or addressing the fundemental conflicts that give the story it's theme. And the length - Jordan has been accused (and rightly so) of milking volume after volume to make money. He isn't the only one to do it, apparently. Plot development is fine, but there comes a time when it is clearly excessive. This series already exceeds in length anything written by Tolstoy, including War and Peace. It is longer than The Rise and Fall of The Roman Empire, or McGarry's entire three-volume history of the Crusades. I've read them all, and they were all better than A Game of Thrones (and I really dislike Tolstoy, but even he knew how to finish a story). Finally, I don't know how anyone could enjoy this series and not feel some sense of mysogynism - just like Jordan, Martin seems to like his women as idiots or sexual playthings. I'm a man and a father, and I wouldn't want my son or daughter thinking that any of the characters in this novel were admirable. Don't waste your time with this one - keep looking.e Tolstoy, but even he knew how to finish a story).

It's about bringing out what's inside, of which Lead Vocalist Amy lee demonstrates with such brilliance. On one end of the scale you have the heavy rock of tracks like 'Bring Me To Life' and 'Going Under' to more the subtle ballads of 'My Immortal' and 'Hello'. From start to finish Fallen should be on your must-buy list, and when you put that shiny disk into your player and press play you may never want to press stop.
B0000931OG|5.0|Wow! At first I thought I had made a mistake with this album.  Crazy Beat was playing constantly on the local fm station and with it's punky edge I wondered what the rest of the album would hold.  I am truly impressed at the finished product.  It has a range of wierd and wonderful songs, but all have merit.  From slow moving ballads filled with rich intelligent lyrics, to off the wall but very cool 'Jets'.  My favorites 'Caravan' and 'Gene by Gene' are both masterpieces in themselves.  This is a new era for Blur.  A must for any intelligent music lover.
B00008NG5V|5.0|When compared to JJ's debut album Brushfire Fairtales, On and On is very mellow. But, that is what JJ is all about. Tracks like &quot;Traffic In the Sky&quot; grip you when you think about it's meaning. &quot;Cookie Jar&quot; chills you to the bone. JJ shows his writing talent on this intoxicating album of 16 tracks. JJ flows words together to give his listner a mental image of what he's saying. His lyrics are fresh and soothing. On and On is set up much the same as BFFT. The opening track is &quot;Times Like These&quot; (this song sets up the listener for the entire album, it describes what it disk is about.) On BFFT, JJ did the same thing with &quot;Inaudible Melodies&quot; (He set up the listener.) Many people try to compare On and On with BFFT, however, you simply cannot do so. On and On is a set of different experiences completly in the life of JJ. The best thing about it is how smoothly it takes us from track to track. And JJ keeps the same style and structure of his songs that he did on his first album. He adds more digital effects to the songs as the CD progresses. But, by far what will make this album enjoyable for any listener, is the final song &quot;Symbol in My Driveway&quot;. Not only is the meaning deep and touching...but, it's recorded outside, by the ocean in Hawaii! This gives the listener a glimpse into the life of the artist, JJ. By giving music fans clean, beautiful, and tasteful songs, Jack Johnson will continue to shine as a terriffic song writer. Enjoy!
0743244249|5.0|I've read all Don DeLillo's novels, enjoyed some more than others, and turned friends and students on to them, for years--and after my second reading of *Cosmopolis* I'll say that, in my opinion, this is a masterpiece.  He's never been better.  The humor of *Americana*, the poignant profundity of *White Noise*, the treatment of relationships in *Mao II*, the grit of *Underworld*, the soaring lyricism of *The Body Artist*...the BEST of them are all present here, in just over 200 pages.<br />There was a time when I thought DeLillo had a &quot;niche&quot; and that the Zeitgeist had necessarily passed him by--ah, but he's WAY too good.  I don't consider him an &quot;Apocolyptic Postmodernist&quot; anymore, if indeed he ever FIT that label which reviewers too commonly affix to his books--if one MUST put it in a phrase, he's a satirical Spiritual Humanist, concerned with personal identity in a frenetic world, with isolation and with loneliness, and with the absurdity of the world that serves as its own complex character in his work.<br />This is, at first reading, a difficult book--and it's worth it.  Authors like, say, Chuck Palahnuik are doing what DeLillo *used* to do--but DeLillo is truly amazing in his ability to adapt to the &quot;times&quot; and continually out-write the younger writers who are so heavily influenced by him.  <br />It occurs to me that if there's a book to compare this to, it's not DeLillo himself but, in sundry strange yet fitting ways, *Notes from the Underground*, by Dostoyevsky.  I've read the other reviews here, and I understand, I believe, both the positives and the negatives of what these readers are saying.  It took even *me* a second reading to really begin to &quot;get&quot; it--*Cosmopolis* is condensed, very complex, disquieting and challenging.<br />I'm glad I took the challenge.  In the midst of the times in which we live, we're often left reeling--and this book just made me feel so vital, so validated to live in my own skin.  <br />So...*alive*.
0380002930|5.0|This is the book I have been searching for, for some time now.  I was enthralled from the beginning, taken with the idea of following Rabbits on an adventure.  The alagorical sense of the book is clear from the start, but I let myself just enjoy the story the first time through, sure that I will disect this book over many future readings.  I found myself unable to remain seated as I read 'Cry havoc!  And let slip the dogs of war!'  Shakespear for sure, but fitting in this epic novel.  This book has all the adventure, suspense and glory of the great works in fiction, all told from a Rabbit's point of view.  I would recommend this book to anyone looking for inspiration in their life.
B000002HEM|5.0|So I exaggerate a bit. But this album is certainly one of the great live pop albums, ranking right up there with &quot;Live at Leeds&quot; or &quot;Frampton Comes Alive&quot;. It shows Merchant and the band at their musical and compositional peaks, with songs and performances that neither has been able to duplicate since. I can't think of a better farewell present to their fans.
B00005QFHG|5.0|the count devours his chocolates<br />Just like her mother, a young woman doesn't stay too long in one place. She goes where the north wind leads her, until she ends up in Lansquenet. There she shocks the priest and the most powerful man in the village. She opens a pastry shop, to sell chocolate desserts in the middle of Lent!<br />One of my two favorite parts in the film CHOCOLAT, based on the book by Joanne Harris, is the party scene. The villagers have already broken with one tradition by eating, instead of giving up, chocolate. They break another by partying with the river rats who go up and down working where, and selling what, they can. <br />The other is the shot of a great tree. The ground around it has been disturbed. Without land, but surrounded by air, light and water, the tree doesn't die. Does this symbolize what Vianne's chocolates do for the villagers? Without the usually tightened belt and diet of Lent, Vianne's customers don't shrivel up either.<br />It's always good to see the multi-talented Johnny Depp and to find Juliette Binoche and Lena Olin together again. Here the two reverse the personality types that they played so well in \\"The unbearable lightness of being.\\" Both actresses would do wonders with GIRL WITH A PEARL EARRING by Tracy Chevalier and GIRL IN HYACINTH BLUE by Susan Vreeland if either book makes it into film one of these days.
B00008972S|4.0|Update - Second comment:  a Puerto Rican would never refer to the United States as \\"America\\" (as the song goes \\"I Like to Live in America\\").  This is simply because \\"America\\" is North America, Central America and South America.  \\"America\\" for a Puerto Rican refers to all three Americas.  I have only one comment:  What were they thinking when they decided to paint Natalie Wood's face?  She could have easily pass for Puerto Rican without having that awful paint on.
B000065PUE|5.0|I remember buying this on cassette at Tape World at the Auburn Mall in the fall of 1989, my senior year in High School. My friend Allyson drove and somehow I convinced her to play the cassette that I bought, not the ones that she or the love of her life had purchased that evening. From the bassline that starts Debaser we were blown away from then on the only sound in the car for the entire 60 minute ride home came from the speakers. If you don't have it yet, don't tell anyone, just buy it.
B000089RVX|4.0|I was pretty impressed with \\"Bring Me To Life\\" when I heard it on the radio, and the whole disc is pretty good......especially compared to the usual radio drivel.<br /><br />Like I said, if you like what Evanescence is doing, you'll LOVE what Pain of Salvation does.
B00008YJH5|5.0|You saw Fight Club so you know &quot;Where Is My Mind?&quot;.  The rest of the tracks are just as good if not better.  Steve Albini engineers this (don't ever call him a producer), and turned Joey Santiago's surf guitar work into a buzz saw that is perfectly balaced with Black Francis's complete volcal insanity.  This album is like a perfect mix tape, it starts out strong, builds power for a few songs, cools it down through the middle with Gigantic to Cactus, goes crazy again with Tony's Theme through I'm Amazed, and then one of the all time great final tracks with Brick Is Red!  I have had each and every one of these songs stuck in my head for weeks at a time.
6301661737|5.0|First, this is the great film of the historical genre from Japan.  Second, it may be the model for recent history in Iraq.  <br />...As a drama of manners, \\"Kagemusha\\" serves as a thorough introduction to the presentation layer of the Samurai in Tokogawa Japan. At the ending scenes, this shadow-warrior is able to take to heart the projection of honor and spirit within Shinto.  <br />We owe a prayer of thanks to Lucas and Coppola.  Without them, neither \\"Ran\\" nor \\"Kagemusha.\\"  Two wonderful, great men.<br />Tatsuya Nakadai (acting Lord Shingen and the double) immerses us in a world where male Samurai had a 50% chance of dying in battle. Their language of grunts and body gestures is still the subject of deep study in Japan.  The performances here takes us to a key hole, where we can see this world acted out.<br />\\"Ran\\" -- in comparison -- is embroiled in the conflicts between Buddhist sensibility, personified with Sue' and the other non-warrior characters, and the code of Bushido and its core Shinto beliefs. The revenge-spirit within the wife is Shinto at its purest.  She destroys the whole clan of her family's murderers.  Willingly, she gives her most-honorable head to the blade. <br />Here in \\"Kagemusha\\" the sacrifice of one's life is given freely by dozens of Samurai.  Whole squads of soldiers throw their bodies before arrows aimed at the false Lord.  As it happened then. The achievement of this film is that we almost understand what is happening.  <br />And what sacrifices will we be willing to make, if SARS tests us next year, in the winter of 2004 ???  How important are courage and loyalty to us ?  How will we die ?
B00008PX8P|5.0|led zeppelin is the greatest band ever to come across the earth...this shows some of their greatest stuff....buy it.<br />P.S. rock n roll will never die
B00008O31H|5.0|This second album exceeds their first release, which sounded like a well studied tribute to Hendrix in many ways.  This CD reminds me of all my old favorites; Music Machine's &quot;Talk-Talk&quot;; The Shadows of Knight, Question Mark and the Mysterions, and Syndicate of Sound.  Some tracks sound like you wish for a second guitar to fill in the lead or rhythm, alternately.  But if you think more than three - four members in a group are too many, this will be to your liking.  The lyrics are true blues insights, and the recording is very retro sounding.<br />I recommend to any rock lover, it is a solid, garage-churner.
B00006RAKP|5.0|Elton John has been a force in music for more than 30 years. He has an incredible amount of talent, both as an author of music, and as a performer. This collection attempts to pull together some of the best of Elton's work from his career, beginning with the \\"Elton John\\" album and ending with \\"Songs from the West Coast\\".<br />Nearly every song on this CD is musically good to excellent. Most of these songs were hits. As a sampler of Elton's music, this collection is a very good start. However, this CD does have a few flaws. The principal flaw is that while the CD purports to be Elton John's greatest hits, it does miss quite a few hits. The missing songs that stood out most noticeably to me are \\"Lucy in the Sky with Diamonds\\" and \\"Pinball Wizard\\". However, there are other songs that were top 10 that were missed as well. It is impossible to represent Elton's greatest hits with only two CDs, and that is the main flaw of this collection.<br />The difficulty with most \\"greatest hits\\" collections is choosing the songs. Regardless of how good a job you do, there will be a fan who thinks a song was neglected. Conversely, there will be other fans that think a song on the collection should have been excluded. Rather than complain about what was or wasn't on this collection, the focus should be on this collection alone. At this time, this collection is the best single representation of Elton over the bulk of his career. For the songs that were missed from this collection, you can add \\"Rare Masters\\" and \\"Love Songs\\", which pick up a lot more of Elton's early career and fills in more of Elton's best.<br />With more than 40 albums, comprising hundreds of songs, choosing the 34 best is an absolutely terrible job. Similar to those people who would have added other songs, or subtracted some of those included, I too would have done something similar. However, we would never have agreed on the best. So take this CD as the best collection available to sample Elton's career. From that viewpoint, this CD rates 5 stars. Then you can add the other CDs I mentioned, and in the case of the classic albums and a few others, add original albums as well. We live in an imperfect world, thus a less than perfect collection of Elton's career is better than not having this collection at all.ewpoint, this CD rates 5 stars. Then you can add the other CDs I mentioned, and in the case of the classic albums and a few others, add original albums as well.

B00008H2LE|5.0|I got this CD the day it came out, and now, 2 months later, i still can't stop listening to it! it is simply amazing how good this CD is.  LP is the best, hands down!  Don't Stay, Somewhere I Belong, Lying From You, Faint, Numb, Nobody's Listening, and Figure.09 all have the potential to be chart-topping singles (somewhere I belong already has been)! GET THIS CD!
0312305060|3.0|This is a very depressing story.  I knew it was going to be when I started it, but I kept going because Michael Cunningham's prose had me hooked.  He is an amazingly gifted writer, and he has created a very unique and gloomy story here.<br />I was a bit confused with the chapters going back and forth between the three women's stories at first.  After awhile I started to get to know each character and see the way he'd written it to all come out together as one.<br />Instead of going into detail about each, I will simply say this.  These are lives that are not happy, they all seem to be walking zombie-like through life and not really living it.  It is very dreary.<br />Even though this is going to have the sensitive emotional wrecks like me out there bawling, You will get an eyeful of beautiful writing as well.
0399226907|4.0|My 3 yr old daughter loves this book & so will your child!
B00008H2LB|3.0|I agree with all the people that say this album is too short because it is way to short.  I agree with all the people that say Chester just screams over and over again..Is that all he does?  Song after song is hearing this guy just go nuts screaming at the top of his lungs..Please tell me people is he that mad at the world?  I do like LP.  I enjoy their music and they just get me pumped up I guess.  Like I said in my title I dont know what to think about this album..I like it but then when I think about it..it isnt really a good album at all.  Someone needs to let screamboy sing for once..I know why he does it..it is to sell albums..that is what the teens love..Another thing is I love bands that change...LP did not change at all from their first album..well he screams more I guess..A band that used to scream is Staind..now Staind doesnt scream and his new album is great..mainly because they change their music or try new things..LP is a great band but they need to try new things..Try singing..try changing things up..people will still buy the albums..One thing I know it that he needs to stop screaming because he wont have a voice in 5yrs.
0312263120|5.0|Dan Brown writes for an intelligent reader, someone who can appreciate the subtle mysteries encoded in the more intricate plot and who enjoys gleaning factual information pertinent to the subject at hand, in this case computers, cyberspace and the politics they engender, while enjoying a facsinating read. Brown's considerable skill in imparting remarkable tid bits of information in interesting ways is clearly evident in this early work.  Yes, he has improved but this first effort is well worth your time.<br />Brown's skills are not limited to teaching his audience about technology and encryption puzzles.  In addition to a cleverly crafted plot he creates characters whom his readers are eager to embrace. Susan Fletcher a brilliant and patriotic mathematician works for a secret government agency, NSA, that uses the latest computer technology to find and uncode terrorist messages. She and her lover, David Becker, a highly regarded university professor fluent in many languages, are faced with a crisis that tests their abilities and puts their lives at risk when a brilliant but confused ex agent develops a deadly encryption code. The clever twists and turns make pausing unthinkable until the situation is resolved.<br />The beauty of reading a novel by Dan Brown is in taking the time to enjoy his prose and all the information contained therein.  Unfortunately the suspenseful story forced me to finish much too quickly. I'll just have to read it again!
B00005R2IS|5.0|got to love the original soundtrack, much better then the cheesy speedracer sounding voiceover of the original us release. this is truely a fast and furious movie.  BUY IT Quick!!
B00008S2VG|5.0|Don't listen to all the negative feedback.  This album is the best Madonna album ever!  Each track will have you singing along.  My favorite track is &quot;Nobody Knows Me&quot;.....that song will have you dancing!  Everyone has their own opinion, so don't judge until you hear it and you won't be disappointed!
B00003CXTG|2.0|Thousands of lives lost.  The USS Arizona with thousands of men trapped inside.  An affair between two friends and their girlfriend.  I thought it was supposed to be about Pearl Harbor and the men who died and survived, not about some soap opera where the best friend takes the girl then dies.  This truly does degrade the survivors of that fateful day.  I will admit, I gave it 2 stars because the Doolittle raid had its moments-until the end: \\"Don't die! You can't die, because your gonna be the daddy of my girlfriend's baby!\\" It seems more like a soap opera than a tribute, and although it has some parts to it, your better off seeing Tora! Tora! Tora! or even a WW2 documentary.
B000089RVX|2.0|When I first heard of this band it was reading the lyrics to their overplayed hit off the album. Spiritual in nature and moving in content, but the writing is quite banal. It is the highlight of the album however. MY Immortal grasps at half spiritual mantra and half love song and succedes in acheiving neither. This is just lyricly.<br />  As far as musical composition is concerned I was even further disapointed. The technical writing shows a very limited creativity. The same notes and progresion will be used with only slight rythmic variation through out entire songs. The addition of hardcore-esq vocals in some songs ruin them.<br />  Not a bad first album, but I hope their musical quality grows and the lyrics escape the self-loathing angsty trite rut they seem to be in.
B00003CXXI|5.0|Shrek wants just one thing: to be left alone in his swamp.  You'd think an ogre wouldn't have a problem keeping people away.  Unfortunately, there's this talking donkey who won't leave.  In addition, Lord Farquaar has decided that Shrek's swamp makes a fine refugee camp for fairy tale creatures.  In order to reclaim his peace and quiet, Shrek agrees to go on a quest, with donkey in tow, to rescue the Princess Fiona and deliver her to Lord Farquaar.<br />The bare bones of this story only hints at the wonderfully demented sensibility of this movie, and the delightful ways familiar fairy tales are turned on their heads.  Kids and parents alike will love the many sight gags, one-liners and instances of potty humor.  Mike Myers and Eddie Murphy are just plain funny.  This feel-good, laugh-until-it-hurts movie will entertain the entire family.<br />Don't forget to stick around after the credits for the karaoke song and dance extra.  No viewing of Shrek is complete with a family sing-along at the end.
B00006BTCA|5.0|Wow. I know there are other people out there that like interpol. i've been to their message board. i've talked to the indie kids about em. they all like em. my sister likes em. but for me it's more than that. the first time i listened to turn on the bright lights was in the virgin records superstore right down in times square. it was my first ever visit to ny and i was all caught up in the magic. i was at one of those listening kiosk things that they have and the song 'obstacle 1' instantly struck me. it's kind of rare for me that a song that is instantly &quot;sing-a-longable&quot; will last without getting old for me. well that trip was back in august and it has now been almost a year since i first heard it. each time i listen to bright lights it becomes more apart of my life. sometimes i feel bad because i ALWAYS have a random song from the album stuck in my head and it doesn't help when i'm supposed to be listening to someone. these guys have had an impact on me. i guess i'm more than the average interpol fan. this and radiohead's kid a and ok computer are the only cd's to ever inhabit my brain, lay an egg inside and grow and grow and grow. if you haven't purchased this album then go do it now. and if you don't like it by the second or third listen, it's ok. give it time. it will come. i promise.
B00005OAA6|1.0|Poor album from a woman with obviously no talent except for Looking good. The reason why Victoria is famous is because shes married to David Beckham. Boring music with cliched lyrics and annoying voice. Virgin records spend 10 million dollar on this and the album sold 50,000 copies and recieved poor reviews from ciritcs.
B00000K19E|5.0|The Matrix is simply one of the most visually stunning and intellectually enthralling Science Fiction/Action Adventure films to be produced in recent history.  It is the quintessential film of the nineties and now the new millennium.  Amazingly enough; at the time of its release I was working extremely long hours and didn't even see a trailer for it so I missed it at the theater.  After hearing so many good things about it, I purchased it and was absolutely floored by its originality; mind blowing action and compelling plot.  The Wachowski Brothers deserve nothing but the highest praise that they continue to receive for putting this story to paper and the silver screen.<br />I've never been much of a Keanu Reeves fan but that opinion definitely changed with this movie and I'm sure will continue with its follow on movies \\"The Matrix Reloaded\\" and \\"The Matrix Revolutions.\\"  He is absolutely perfect in the role.  Laurence Fishburne in the role of Morpheus is outstanding as usual, making it seem as if the role was made for him.  In the role of Trinity is the ever so beautiful Carrie-Anne Moss whose hard work and stunning gorgeousness shines brilliantly on the silver screen and the home theater screen.  Hugo Weaving performing as Agent Smith is nothing less than perfect in the role of the nemesis.  Joe Pantoliano delivers another great performance in the role of good guy turned bad.<br />Combining a brilliant story and superb directing by the Wachowski brothers with superb performances by the aforementioned actors brings forth what is most likely one of the best Science Fiction/Action &amp; Adventure flicks of the nineties and the catalyst for this years release of the sequels which are both expected to reach astronomical levels at the box office.<br />The premise:<br />Thomas Anderson a.k.a. Neo is living two lives, by day he's a computer programmer who is seemingly living by all the rules as Thomas Anderson, by night he's Neo, a computer hacker who is breaking every computer derived law in the book.  For quite some time he's also had the strangest feeling that everything is not as it seems.  He begins to hear rumors of someone named Morpheus and something called \\"The Matrix.\\"  Suddenly, while he's searching for Morpheus, Morpheus seeks him out and then Mr. Anderson's world is turned inside out...  What follows from there is as stated above, one of the most compellingly well written Science Fiction/Action &amp; Adventure flicks to grace the silver screen and the home theater in quite some time.  This is a movie that can be watched repeatedly and it's just as exciting as the first time you watched it!<br />I \\"highly\\" recommend this film to all who are interested in a \\"great\\" movie that is unbelievable in its scope and detail and perfect even in its minor trivialities.  {ssintrepid}
B0000024SI|5.0|This was the second Dylan record I bought and I love it so much. I like the blending between the instruments, lyrically amazing and vocally it is suprisingly good. Great songs especially the first song Like A Rolling Stone which peaked at impressive no.2 on the pop singels chart even though being 6 minutes long. All the other songs are amazing and fine mix of rock, blues, jazz and folk. Amazing album.
B00004RFFI|2.0|Ok. I saw this flick when it came out in 1996. On first viewing it isn't so bad. Then when you go the distance and take notice of how awful the acting and storyline are, you have a rude awakening. The word to describe this film is 'annoying'. The acting is annoying. The forever worn out and severly lame 'Lover's-Quarrel-But-Everyone-Gets-Back-Together-In-The-End' sub plot is annoying. The 'bad guys' driving black vehicles and having that ever politically incorrect 'corporate backing' (how dare they?!) is annoying. The one liners are annoying. The fact that every tornado is refered to as 'she' or 'her' is annoying. The fact that the homemade weather station named 'Dorothy' is refered to as 'she' or 'her' is annoying. The final scene with the main characters tying themselves up inside a decrepit shack and end up flying around safely inside an F-5 tornado is annoying. Bill Paxton's rotten acting and 'intense' monotone voice (who told this guy he could act?) plus Helen Hunt's usual terrible acting are annoying. The scene where everyone freezes and look at each other when the reference to an 'F-5 tornado' is mentioned and is refered to as 'The Finger Of God' is annoying. Trucks driving through houses, the main 'bad guy' getting sucked up into the F-5 after ignoring Paxton's warnings, Bill Paxton telling Helen Hunt that he is still in love with her while his 'wife to be' hears the conversation over the CB radio, Helen Hunt's 'death Wish' by confronting each tornado, one of the professional storm chasers deciding to take cover in a truck while a tornado is coming (even I know not to do that!), the little plastic piece of junk 'sensors' rigged with sliced up soda cans for propellers being sucked up into the tornado and are not pulverized, the fact that all the domestic animals that are shown somehow survive (Hollywood seems to have no problem showing people being mauled but heaven forbid a down home pet gets wiped out), the fact that the scene following the destruction of the drive in theater in Wakita is not included (was it ever shot?) are all ANNOYING! Good points: opening scene where the Helen Hunt character's father is sucked into an F-5 tornado, tornado destroying the drive in theater, 18 wheeler being thrown at the main characters truck, the final tornado wiping out a large barn and the 5.1 surround sound. Based on these points alone, I give this film two points. A note to the producers for a follow up: Do your science homework. Lay off the played out love story sub plot, good guys versus the bad guys nonsense and hire some good actors!
B00005OAIE|2.0|John Mayer. Well This album is not very good one. His voice is annoying and perhaps sounds a bit too like Dave Matthews ( who I dont like either). He knows how to play a guitar and I give the album credit that it has good musicianship but the songwriting is terrible. I though that person that has these skills could write a decent tune but jeez. The melodies are okay but the rythm and the lyrics. Dont get me started on the lyrics. Most of the lyrics are so bland and shallow and especially the hit single your Body Is A Wonderland I mean could it be more corny than that. This man has obviously talent for playing but he needs to find wider range for his voice and try to write better songs. Sorry maybe next time.

My Favorite contemporary book.  The only book I recommend more is the Bible.  This is an awesome, amazing,and inspired book.
B000000WFF|3.0|In 1997 The Spice Girls were everywhere. Their debut album Spice was selling like crazy. They were touring constantly. They were maked fun constantly and they were in every magazine out there. Nude pictures of Geri were found and put in playboy and all kinds of stuff was happening. There were rumours of Anorexia. They acted in their first film in the summer of 1997 and right afterwards recored their album. In november 1997 their second album was released barely a year after the first one and that album was still seling well and a month later the film Spice World hit theatres. <br />Well this album was not as good as the first one. There were many fillers and plaine old boring songs. The songs that were any good were the hit singels and that was Spice Up Your Life, Too Much and Stop. I didn´t like Viva Forever that was corny. Other songs were okay or bad. The Spice Girls obviously made this album in a hurry and it shows. Vocally it is not as good as its predecessor. Geri is obviously not having too much fun and Victoria gets to sing. Obviously it had to have some backlash and it did. The album debuted at disapointing no. 8 in the US although it would peak at no. 3 two or three weeks later and sell 4 million copies there. Spice World sold over 15 million untis world-wide far less then previous album and just few motnhs later everybody had gotten tired of The Spice Girls. By may 1998 Geri quit the band. Victoria was engaged. All of them were trying different things and it just seemed like the Spice Girls were over.

The best advice this book gives is that &quot;You do not have to forgive for things or actions you do not understand and can not change.&quot; It sheds light on possibly naming exactly what behaviors you exspect or tell your parents to treat me in the right way or take the high road! A++++++ The Best Book Written!
B00001OH7M|3.0|Perhaps no masterpiece but Space Oddity Bowies second release was a pretty good album. Good combination of Folk,Psychadelic and Rock. Although called Space Oddity after the first track on the album also Bowies first hit single the album itself is far from being Spacey or strange. David obviously was very influenced by Dylan and others and he probably showed more his influence then himself on the album ( sort of like Lenny Kravitz) and perhaps thats the reason why so many music critics have overlooked Space Oddity ( originally titled Man of Sound or music or whatever). This album is by no means a masterpiece but it is good nevertheless.
0375823360|5.0|I have just this moment finished the final book in the His Dark Materials trilogy. I honestly don't know what it was, but this trilogy has blown my mind.<BR>     <BR>     Imagine plodding through the first book of a trilogy, not too impressed at all with it. Throughout the second half of the book, I'm thinking of going back on my plan to read through all three books, back to back. Whereas I once thought how nice the trilogy would look in my bookshelf, I was now thinking of who I might give them to once I finished. Then, I reach the end of that first book. It finishes on a high point, with a final chapter which is intriguing enough to send me to the first chapter of book two. And then the series takes an interesting turn...<br />     It turns out that the world in which the first book took place was merely a small part of the universe encompassed in the entire trilogy. Without expecting it, I am captivated by the story which bored me at points. I tear through the second book in a little over a week (quick for someone with not much time to read), and then read the astonishing third book in a little less than two weeks. In reading the final pages of the third book, I have finished a trilogy which I now consider to be one of the best stories I have ever read, one which I am likely to return to more than once. It is not Lord of the Rings. It is not Harry Potter. Nor should it be compared to either of the two. It has some similarities, but is an entirely different creature. Characters I was iffy on at the beginning have become very dear to my heart. Most amazingly, I am very anxious to reread the first book. Knowing what I now know about the rest of story, the events in the first book, as well as the other two, will take on some whole new meanings.<br />     I don't expect people to feel as I do, but I would recommend this book to just about anybody. And I would tell them to throw out all of their expectations of what they think the story will be like. Throw out all preconcieved comparisons to any other stories until the end of the last book, at which time they can make their own comparisons. I would warn them that these are NOT children's books, even though some articles make them out to be. The religious and emotional issues dealt with are too deep for almost anyone below high school level. And some of the violence is definitely not for the young. Lastly, the only type of person I would not recommend these books to is someone who is not open minded in terms of God and religion. Deeply religious people might be offended at some of the ideas presented in the story, unless they can objectively differentiate fiction from non. <br />     So there you go. It saddens me to be away from the worlds inside this story. I can only hope Philip Pullman, still being alive, might continue with a new story set in this world at some point in the future.
B00008H2LE|3.0|The making of Meteora started about 18 months ago while touring that the OZZfest after the release of Hybrid Theory. The bonus DVD profiles LP's making of &quot;Meteora&quot; and how they revised lyrics &amp; tracks hundreds (!)of times. I think that pursuit of the ultimate perfection was their downfall. Why did they waste all that creative energy on a final cut of a measly 11 tracks worth less than 40 mins? They should have stuck to their initial instincts because they seemed to have strived too hard to reinvent themselves to a point where I wonder is this *really* Linkin Park?<br />Even Reanimation was a fresh look at LP's range and talents. Whereas the tracks on Meteora are generic and forgetable. &quot;Nobody's Listening&quot; is the worst of them all with a whiny &quot;Nooobodyees listenin'!&quot; and a japanese flute track that just doesn't match. <br />*shudder* &quot;Sounds like the album Grandpa put out&quot;-Homer Simpson.<br />LP's #1 debut has rose and fallen just like a meteor. However, I would love to see if they would salvage the dozens of unreleased tracks for the next album that all started on the back of a tour bus.
B00005JLRT|5.0|This movie is a great sendoff to the crew that entertained Trek fans for so long. It's action packed and full of emotion. Pick this up if you are a fan of the TNG bunch.
B00000JCOV|3.0|This is a good CD but not great like IOWA. LIke I said in the title of this review: Not up to their potential! I actually really liked this disk when it came out but Iowa makes this sound garbage. I still give it three stars for good heavy songs like (sic),eyeless, and Me inside. Wait &amp; bleed is a good choice for a single, but Spit it Out is just plain horrible. Purity was one of the best tracks but they took it off. 3 stars. Mediocre. Pick up Iowa.
079284470X|1.0|I have seen this movie way too many times and am very sick of it.  It plays on television way too many times and I am forced to watch it or hear it cause somebody else in the house likes it. So, if you enjoy the movies from back in the 80's, then you will like this one.  Of course, some &quot;older&quot; movies are classics and you can never get sick of watching them, but this one just isn't one of them.<BR>I just don't like the acting and the story line in this movie.  I don't think it is funny and they could have done better.
B00005A46T|5.0|This CD is second only to Metallica's \\"Master of Puppets\\" I normally don't do this but this is a really great disk so I'll run through it song by song.<br />515- Intro 0/10<br />People=$#!t- Good heavy way to start off the album 10/10<br />Disasterpiece- Same as \\"People\\" but a little lengthy. Corey sings a little at the end. That's Good.7/10<br />My Plague- Not the best.Corey sings a lot. Especially in the chorus. Best singing in Slipknot Ever.8/10<br />Everything Ends- I used to hate this song but then I actually listened to it and now I love it. Rock On! 10/10<br />Heretic Anthem- Not really satanic. It actually has a good message. Don't be a conformo watered down Melvin!9/10<br />Gently- Breaks away from the psychosis for about two minutes then jumps back in. 8/10<br />Left Behind- Sure its radio friendly but it still rocks.

B00005Y6YB|5.0|I have watched this series several times, and like a few other movies I have seen in my 45 years on earth, it always captures my attention. Superb actors at their best in the most scenic settings; plus a storyline with heart and action. A keeper.
B00008K7AM|4.0|Let's face it. 'The Hot Chick' will not be nominated for an Academy Award (or any other award, for that matter), but that does not mean it is a bad movie. Actually, it's the exact opposite. It's actually quite funny and sweet. I rented it the other day mostly because there was nothing much else to rent. I rented it hesitantly, because I figured it would be one of those stupid, silly, slapstick un-funny comedies that we are presented with way too often. I guess you could sort of stick this film in that category, but I hope you don't.<br />Rachel McAdams plays Jessica - a teenaged girl who, via a pair of special antique earrings, wakes up one morning as a man. Actually, she has switched bodies with a robber she met briefly the day before, played by Rob Schneider. Schneider then had the difficult role of playing a teenaged girl stuck inside a man's body, who tries to act like a real man so that no one will find out the truth. He (she) reveals this to her best friend April (played by Anna Farris of all of those 'Scary Movie' films), who not only accepts her new hairy best friend, but actually starts to enjoy hanging out with him (her).<br />Yes, it's silly. No, there's really no originality to be found here. But it made me laugh on more than one occasion. There's a great cameo by a dred-locked Adam Sandler, and Schneider does a decent job portraying a teenaged girl. And there is also a great storyline revolving around the two best friends Jessica and April that is really very sweet. But, if you're looking for a mature comedy, this is not your film. If you just want to watch a fun movie and find yourself chuckling, I honestly think you'll enjoy 'The Hot Chick'.
B00005Q4CS|5.0|And hands down the best film of 2001. Many GREAT films, and \\"Requiem.....\\" is without a doubt one, are tragedies and viewing them a second time is for some of us not an option. I do agree with the one editorial that this is grim stuff and not easy to sit through. But well worth it all the same. <br />Aronofsky, after the success of \\"Pi\\", a film I found much more impressive than enjoyable, actually has a cast to work with this time. The acting in \\"Pi\\" was sub-par, one of the things I didn't like about the film. However, \\"Requiem.....\\" has Ellen Burstyn, Jared Leto, Jennifer Connelly, & Shawn Wayans giving what will surely be the very best performances of their respective careers. Burstyn I've never seen better and her losing the Oscar to Julia Roberts underscores once again how much of a popularity contest those awards are. <br />Bustyn plays Sara Goldfarb, an aging widow starved for companionship and feeling cut-off from her only child, Jared Leto. Her loneliness finds her addicted to television. She fills out an application to be a guest on an infomercial-ish type show and then waits for the call. A call she will never get. In the meantime, in order to look her best on the tube she begins dieting. One scary aspect of the film is how easy it is for her to obtain what is basically speed from her apathetic physician. Before you know it, poor Sara Goldfarb is a total speed freak. At the same time, her son & his girlfriend along with the sons best friend, descend into harrowing addictions to heroin. In this superb film all of the characters are three-dimensional....they live & breathe. The film also makes the obvious but no less impactful statement that drug addiction cuts across all boundaries of the economic stratum. You will not soon forget some of the images of the characters going through withdrawal. Aronofsky is relentless during this part of the film and I think the editorial that describes the film as \\"a relentless sensory assault\\" cannot be any more perfect a description.  There are two harrowing scenes with Jennifer Connelly's character showing where her addiction has taken her.  I think it's important to mention that there is some comic relief in the form of Goldfarbs neighborhood friends.(it was especially nice to see Louise Lasser again) And Thank God for the humor or else I don't know if I could take it. If Aronofsky's \\"Pi\\" had some of the off-hand humor of \\"Requiem....\\" it may have been more successful.<br />So if your tastes lean more toward challenging, thought-provoking outside-the-mainstream fare, and you aren't especially squeamish \\"Requiem.....\\" is a viewing experience you won't soon forget. Like I said, this is powerful stuff and I wouldn't suggest viewing it alone. I did and found it hard to shake the disturbing images and depressing outcome for all of the characters. As a matter of fact, as I write this I can still see Burstyn's Goldfarb going through her withdrawals. Creepy. Lastly, if you decide you want to view this film do yourself a favor and be sure to rent the directors cut. The impact of a film this powerful can only be diluted by cutting and censoring.
B000084T18|5.0|lyrics dont matter to me..This album is a must have .He is the best rapper ever to emerge .All the beat and rhythms are unique and its got a sence of originality..The songs are great and if u r an eminem fan ull like this even better.<BR>My personal favorite so is Dont push me fit. Eminem.This song certainly grows on you.As well as In da club .21 questiens which shows a whole new romantic side of 50 cent and shows he has a heart after all.Patiently waiting is superb and i think is would really boost the album sales if releasd. Many men is the kind of song u like more as u listen to it.I used to be an anti- rap person before i listen to this but now i do certainly like rap . This is the best album ever if 50 cent can make another album like this i would ceratainly worship him(not really).<br />so if u like rap or rnb ..this is THE album to buy<BR>u wont be disapointed. Just bcoz he aint good looking doesnt mean  his album is also ugly <br />so i say to ya all go out and buy it if u havent already got it
0345457684|5.0|This is an amazing first offering for Richard Morgan.  He combines excellent use of metaphor and visualization to paint a sharp picture of a near human future.  The cortical stack is a key element in his vision of tomorrow, and it is well worked into the plot and attitudes of the characters.  The story is tight and there's plenty of action and violence to keep you glued to the pages.  <br />I was very impressed; it compares well to Neuromancer, which is a high point I don't feel Gibson ever managed to surpass.
B00006RIO7|5.0|This is a great CD to listen to while working out.  If you loved the movie, it goes without saying that you'll love this CD, too!
B00005QZ7U|5.0|Upon seeing this movie in the theatre, it definitely became my favourite movie of all time.  It is romantic, entertaining, heart-wrenching, and hilarious!! A must-see!!!
B00008S2VG|3.0|The music is a little bit better than average on most tracks, but most of it is hardly danceable.  After the 3rd listen, I have to admit, I hummed a little.  But the lyrics are enough to send you screaming out of the room or into road rage if you're in traffic.  If Madonna has to perform a lyrical rehash of her less than perfect childhood and her approach/avoidance conflicts with fame and fortune once again, then she should ditch Kabala and seek counsel from Cher and Tina Turner.  Get over it!  I love Madonna dearly, but I really want to slap her face this time.
B00005JKPF|4.0|Awesome!! That's all that can really be said! I am an abot x-men freak & I thought this movie was brillant! Better than the first & I cannot wait until the next installment! The battle between good & evil shall enseuth!
B000002KMY|3.0|Black Sabbath's \\"Heaven and hell\\" (1980) was a real masterpiece and clearly one of the finest heavy metal albums of all time. The follow up \\"Mob rules\\" from 1981 isn't equally good and that's not surprising. Even `tho the production as well as the quality in material is inferior to \\"Heaven and hell\\" there's good moments on \\"Mob rules\\". The opening rocker \\"Turn up the night\\" is rather similar to later songs by Ronnie James Dio, like \\"Evil eyes\\". It also reminds of \\"Neon knights\\" and \\"Wishing well\\" from the \\"Heaven and hell\\" album, but hasn't quite the same quality. \\"Country girl\\" have a similar structure to early Rainbow songs, and could easily have been on the album \\"Ritchie Blackmore's Rainbow\\". \\"Voodoo\\" stand out a bit and I wouldn't be surprised if Jake E Lee (ex Ozzy Osbourne) listened a lot to this song while recording the second Badlands album, funnily called \\"Voodoo highway\\". Songs like \\"The mob rules\\" and \\"Slipping away\\" is nothing to be excited about because they are of rather average standard. Tony Iommi has always had a thing for meaningless instrumental tunes and \\"E5-150\\" is another one. Personally I find the epic \\"The sign of the southern cross\\" and \\"Falling off the edge of the world\\" to be the most interesting songs on this album. Both are built the same way and they are both soft and heavy at the same time. Especially the later clearly bare connection to earlier efforts from Dio (like \\"Gates if babylon\\") but doesn't reach the same heights. I guess \\"Mob rules\\" was forced in a way and came too soon after \\"Heaven and hell\\".
0553579908|4.0|It was good, yes.  Good in the manner that GRRM makes everything he touches into an epic saga of love, war, and grim circumstances.  This novel was somewhat slower than the first volume; it covers a lot more politics.  We are allowed a more intimate view of serveral characters (refreshingly, not all the perspectives are reprisals of the first novel), but some of it seems rather dry and forced.<br />If you enjoyed the first novel, DO read this one, too.  It's worth the hours (and hours and hours) you'll invest in it... to get to the next book, in which the storyline picks up considerably.
B000002B7O|3.0|\\"Diary of a madman\\" is not by any means comparable to \\"Blizzard of ozz\\". While the debut album had such a strong set of songs it can't be regarded as nothing else than one of the finest metal albums ever made, \\"Diary of a madman\\" is a rather pale follow up. This is similar to the  situation with Black Sabbath's \\"Heaven and hell\\" and \\"Mob rules\\" - it's hard if not impossible to follow up a masterpiece! But I believe this album includes two of Ozzy's greatest songs ever - \\"Over the mountain\\" and \\"Flying high again\\". They are both excellent!
0553381709|5.0|GRRM continues a great series without running the storyline(s) into the ground.  We're introduced into a few new perspectives, so we get to see the world fresh... well, colored by the motives and opinions of the characters we love and hate.  Jaime's perspective was quite welcome (not just because we share a name).  Davos the Onion Knight, with his high ideals (despite his former life as a smuggler), has wormed his way into my favorites.  And, strangely, I'm totally in love with Jon, the ever-popular Bastard of Winterfell.<br />I'd hate to simply repeat what other reviewers have said, so I'll just be breif: if you enjoyed the previous two novels in this series, you will enjoy this one.
B00005NTP2|3.0|Europe kicked off the career excellent with the releases of \\"Europe\\" and \\"Wings of tomorrow\\", just to slowly run out of fuel along the road from heavy metal to pop-metal. \\"Prisoners in paradise\\" is the last effort from the band that was inspired by UFO and Thin Lizzy, but ended up being musical pals with Warrant and Def Leppard. The music on this album feels very time typical and enough time haven't passed yet for any nostalgic value. I must admit that some songs are rather good and if you choose to listen to one or two songs at a time you'll find this album to be much better than if you play the whole disc at once. Small doses might do the trick!
0553103547|5.0|I was skeptical about starting this series.  I had been reading a lot of Robert Jordan and was getting rather disgusted with series fantasy in general.  I'm so glad that I decided to go ahead and plunge into this series.  Before I'd finished this volume, I came back to Amazon and bought the next two; I didn't want to have to wait to continue in this facinating story.<br />The Starks of Winterfell seem to have a perfect life--Ned, the father, is a Lord renouned for his justice; Catelyn has five wonderful children and a loving husband.  When Ned's good friend, who happens to be king of the Westeros, makes a long journey to ask Ned to be his Hand... it sets off a chain of events that will eventually rip them all apart.<br />The most wonderful aspect of this story is that the \\"bad guys\\" are not all bad.  And the \\"good guys\\" are not all good.  Everyone has an agenda, everyone has some personal perogative.  Start this series, and you will not be disappointed.
B000002IHU|3.0|Ratt belong in the same category as Cinderella, Poison, Mtley Cre, Icon, Warrant, and Winger to name a few. \\"Invasion of your privacy\\" is actually a rather decent album and may not be as slick or polished you'd suppose. The opening \\"You're in love\\" is more of a rocker than a metal-poser-thing a la Poison's \\"Unskinny bop\\", and there's other good tunes as well, like \\"Lay it down\\". The material on this album is much better than the singer, and with a more masculine and powerful vocalist, the songs on this album would in fact be very good. But a part of the whole L.A. metal scene was clearly to recruit singers who sounded just like Ratt's. Too bad!
0060254920|5.0|What fun!  What imagination! Any child can relate to making mischief and being sent to their room.  But Max doesn't let that stop him.  After being sent to his room for making to much mischief, a forest grows and grows and grows until trees are all around and the vines cover his ceiling and an ocean forms.  Max takes a boat that's made just for him and travels for almost a year to where the Wild Things are and is named King of all Wild Things.  That's when the wild rumpus begins.  But then, he wants to be somewhere where he is loved.  When he smells something good to eat from far off, he gets back into his boat. But not without the Wild Things begging him to stay.  Soon, Max is back in his room where his supper is waiting for him.  And it's still hot!  The illustrations are outstanding...not so bright as to distract from the story-line, which is short but very descriptive, yet are very imaginative helping to spark the imagination of the young reader who delves into the pages of 'Where the Wild Things Are'.
B00005JL3A|5.0|I've read many of the reviews here at amazon.com.  I find it interesting how what is considered \\"a minor film\\" has brought on so many \\"Love it\\"/\\"Hate it\\" opinions.  I (a non-gamer) fall in the \\"Love it\\" group.  I've read criticisms of the beginning of the film and how it is hard to follow.  It seamed quite apparent (to me) that you were supposed to be confused in the beginning so you could identify with the main character that has lost her memory.  I thought it actually brilliant how things become clearer to the viewer as the effects of the knockout gas wear off of Mila Jovovich's character.  I am also surprised that people can watch a video-game based film and have such high expectations.  I went into this thinking, \\"I sure hope there's a lot of special effects and good action\\".  I came out of viewing my rental thinking, \\"That was so much better than I expected, I must own this!!\\"  Heck, I thought \\"Mortal Kombat\\" was a passable video game adaptation; Full of action, had a story, fair acting.  I'm not sure what people expect when a film like this comes out.<br /><br />Here's my reasoning behind supporting this DVD;<br />-There is actually a story in this film and it requires your strict attention.<br />-Better than average acting for a film of this genre.<br />-Visually stunning.  Pay attention to how color (and the lack of) is used.<br />-So it has a metal soundtrack... what did you expect?<br />-Sound quality is very good.  \\"Whisper\\" in the vent is very subtle and creepy.<br />-I have never played the game.  This is the film, not the game.<br /><br />What to look for;<br />-Not much gore.  Some will find this disappointing.  I personally don't think it matters.  There is an ample supply of blood however.<br />-More tension and suspense than scares.  I think this film has a great emotional edge to it.<br />-Great character development.  You might care when they die.<br />-George Romero Zombie rules are in effect; Blow to the head, infect with bites or scratches, and eat the living.<br /><br />-Laser room is a great moment in horror film history.  If it does not freak you out, then I don't know what craziness you've witnessed.<br />-Plenty of good extras for the money.<br /><br />I personally looked at this as a film, without consideration to the video game.  That comparison is no more fair than comparing \\"Lord of The Rings\\" films to the books.  Sure, we all want a reasonable level of \\"faithfulness\\", just be fair to what you are looking at.  I believe the only fair way to judge a film is to keep the media separated.horror film history.

As the caterpillar searches for food and tries to satisfy his hunger, Carle combines the days of the week and counting so that little ones are learning as they follow the hungry caterpillar.  On Monday, he ate through one apple - and there is a hole in the apple!  On Tuesday, he ate through two pears - and there are holes in each of the two pears...and so on and so forth.  Finally, after continuously eating various foods throughout the entire week, the little catepillar has a stomach ache and eats through a leaf and feels better.  Then he spins his little cocoon and becomes a beautiful butterfly.  The colors are bright and add to the beauty of both the caterpillar and the butterfly.  The wording is very short and simple so little ones aren't distracted or bored.  A wonderful addition to any library.
0446310786|5.0|I somehow have managed to miss reading this wonderfull book throughout my school career.  I decided to read it now to see what I was missing over the years.  What I ended with was a book I could not put down.  It is truly an engrossing book stocked full of believable characters.<br />The story works on many different levels and is weaved together masterfully.  The story is told through the eyes of the little girl Scout.  She tells the story about her hometown and the happenings in it.  The reader learns about racism of which her father is the defense attorney for a black man accused of rape.  The entire town knows he is innnocent, but he won't be released because of the color of his skin and the social mores of the time.  The reader also learns of a neighbor with mental illness that facinates the children because he is a mystery.  The best part of this book is that Scout explains the social workings of a small town during the great depression.  It is both humorous and  sad at the same time.  <br />This book is both a Pulitzer Prize winning classic and an easy read.  It is wonderfull and entertaining.  You will not be able to put it down and you won't want to either.
B000002JST|1.0|In my point of view everyone should stay clear of buying this socalled up-graded version of what was once a great classic rock album. Why, you may ask. Well, first of all this isn´t the original album remastered, they have cut out one of the clear highlights of the original album; Crabsody In Blue! Why the hell did they do that??!<br />Secondly, they have included a song already released on the Dirty Deeds Done Dirt Cheap album; Problem Child, which really doesen´t belong here! Why??!! <br />Thirdly, in my point of view they have not managed to improve the sound quality an inch! So what´s the point?<br />I wonder what the guys in the band think of the final product, with no info/linernotes or pictures and an axed song lineup? Have they no interest in the way their art is presentet by the record company? And what is with ATCO? They seem to destroy just about every band and original recording they can get their dirty and amaturish hands on! A disappointing fact. This cd could have been one of the best classic rock albums ever released had it not been for this company. If you want to listen to what it should have sounded like, go visit a used vinyl shop and buy the original vinyl version of the album!

0440214041|3.0|The thing that I admire about John Grisham is that he has a way of explaining legal procedure to the reader that does not condesend and actually makes you feel intellegent afterwards. He did a great job of doing it in \\"The Firm\\" and now Grisham fans will be pleased by this installment as the thrills take you not only to the south but also to the steps of the White House. At the risk of not rehashing the premise and plot, I found some of Grisham's most colorful characters are in this one, namely the President and his Chief of Staff. Also a minor character in \\"The Firm\\" plays a much larger role. Both Tom Clancy and Anne Rice do this trick and I love it. Also his use of dialogue is amazing and you wind up going through a surprizing amount of pages in a short amount of time.<BR> <BR>The only drawback is the while the premise is unique it is somewhat flimsy. And while there are plenty of nail biting chases, and varoius twists and turns, I did not find myself becoming emotionally drawn to the characters. I know Grisham is capable of doing it, just read \\"A Time to Kill.\\" However the payoff is at the end. It really packs a punch and it made me want to read the book again. I have reshelved this one to make sure I do just that some time next year. While far from a modern classic, the book does what it's supposed to: Entertains you and makes want to pick up another one of his books. Good reading.
B00008LDPU|5.0|Beyond is based on a glitch in the matrix.  These kids exploit the glitch and you see leaks of the reality and freeness of the matrix by their actions.  Also, agents are tracking the leaked area, and on the way to fix it and make the people forget what they saw. This girl also goes to save her cat.<BR>  <BR>Kid's Story is about a kid who cannot sleep, like Neo, and Neo sends him a message, in which causes a pursuit through his school to where he falls to his death-- in the matrix-- and is free'd into the real world through self-substantation(sp) he is also the Kid who wishes to carry neo's bags in Reloaded.  <br />I was quite glad to see the Animatrix, Enter the Matrix and Reloaded work with eachother to un cover the story of the 2nd movie.<BR>Also, this is definately worth the buy, i couldn't pull myself away when I saw them personally.  Ended up going to bed 2 hours after I really needed to.<br />Also, World Record is an incredably good story of this man who is aware of the matrix through his extreme abilties in his muscles, and lack of the Matrix to define his strength and speed without making him free.<br />THe 2nd Renassiance (1 and 2) tell an amazing history story of everything behind the matrix (in their world) and keeps you glued to what goes on.  They describe how they \\"scortch the sky\\" too.
B000002UAX|5.0|this may be the greatest album of time if it is a single album,george martin may be right,maybe is better off with a single LP.i know there will lots of gd songs missing,but taking away Paul's acoustic material,which Blackbird is the most outstanding,as well as georges' acoustic material like piggies and long(x3),John's avant garde Revolution 9(which i think will be better off be remain on the shelf or goes to John and yoko's experimental album,by taking all that away,this white LP will tops away Revolver and Pepper as the greatest album ever made.<BR>This will be my track listing.<BR>1. Revolution (the Hey Jude's B Sides)<BR>2. Ob-la-di,Ob-la-da<BR>3. Everybody's got Something to hide except me and my Monkey<BR>4. While my Guitar Gently Weeps<BR>5. Don't Pass Me By<BR>6.

6304466498|2.0|It contains a few funny jokes and moments but is a bit thin on plot. This movie is a complete spoof of the star wars movie and has all the main characters who look nothing like the real versions and have completely different names.
B00008IXAR|5.0|what can i say? simply red's done it again. from the ground breaking 'a picture book' to the monumental 'life' and now to 'home', simply red's style, effortlessly helmed by mick hucknall, has come home. <BR>'sunrise' first caught my attention, with its easy beats, fantastic sampling and mick's anguished yet smooth vocals. i will never, ever get tired of listening to it, for the lyrics are so meaningful. <BR>the title track 'home' is a magnificent piece, making you feel as if you just know what mick is going through. i recommend 'fake' and 'it's you', for being simply red songs with a refreshing twist. <BR>actually, just listen to the whole cd, cos all the tracks are simply breathtaking.
B000005IRG|4.0|Marquee Moon hardly sounds like a 26-year old album, which says a lot about both the album and the state of alternative rock.  Marquee Moon may be the ancestor of most of the alternative rock albums to come in the last 26 years.  There are two guitars playing complementary lines, shaky singing, and a decent rhythm section.  The songs don't jump out at you, but by the second listen I was hooked.  The long jams of &quot;Marquee Moon&quot; and &quot;Torn Curtain&quot; work well, though the semi-ballad &quot;Guiding Light&quot; doesn't work as well as the rest of the album.
0812550706|5.0|A friend of mine lent me this book in high school and I read it twice in the week I had it. Since then I bought it for myself and have read it appoximately 30 times(somewhere around three times a year!). <BR>I have never read a book that captured me like this one has. Every time I read it it's like coming back to an old friend. Not only does the reader have a chance to come to love Ender, but also Bean and Petra and to a lesser degree Crazy Tom and Hot Soup and all the others that eventually play a big role in the end. <BR>I have to admit that I haven't read it yet this year(I must be really behind)but it's one of the only books that I can think about without picking it up and still be able to remember almost everything that happens. <BR>I also should say that before this book and after reading the rest of the series(including the Shadow books)I have never picked up a science fiction novel. I never would have read this one if my friend hadn't insisted. Usually you can find me with a Stephen King or Agatha Christie book, but I would've really been missing out on a great book had I not given in to my friend's persistance.<BR>I recommend this book to anyone, but mostly younger teens who can relate to the growing pains experienced by Ender and his struggle to get through adolescence. It's a great book about friendship and family as well as a good lesson in morality.
0783225482|5.0|This one is a gem for sure. I must admit, I wasn't a big fan of Meryl Streep before seeing this. I know, she is the best actress of her generation and I always respected her talent but the movies she usually appear in, more in the dramatic and depressing range, are not necessarily what I want from \\"the movies\\". I admit it, I am always looking to be entertained first and foremost and here, Streep along with the whole cast succeeds brilliantly.<br /> I usually don't like to give a synopsis of any film I review because other reviewers often do it. And I truly believe that the element of surprise is something most people enjoy when they watch a movie. What I can say though is that this little gem has been grossly savaged by critics at the time of its release for no good reason whatsover even though it was a minor box-office hit.<br /> This is one thing that has always left me puzzled about \\"official\\" critics: the way to have of hating most movies that only want to entertain for the pure pleasure of it. I have absolutely no idea why they hated this wonderful production but I don't really care what they think. Audiences of that time loved the mix of fantasy and dark comedy with amazing performances by all the leads.<br /><br /> Streep really knocked me for a loop in this movie. The delivery of her lines in full camp mode, the subtle gestures, the way she struts and moves her body... It makes her portrayal of the vain, conceited Madeline Ashton extremely real and immensely enjoyable. It is a shame she doesn't star in many comedies because her timing is impeccable. Goldie Hawn, Bruce Willis and Isabella Rossellini all make their characters very memorable as well.<br /> Robert Zemeckis did a great job in concocting a truly enjoyable story with just enough special effects (considered quite impressive back then and still adequate by today's standards) to keep it all together. There are many beautiful camera angle and elaborate sets adding to the satirical tone dictated by the subject matter which is a refusal to grow old gracefully.<br /> One thing though that irked me profoundly about this DVD though is the fact that the movie isn't available in widescreen format. Why is that? I mean, for me the whole point of watching a movie on DVD is the pleasure I get to view the film in its original theatrical format and a full screen version doesn't quite cut it. I really don't understand the choice to exclude the widescreen version which should be a prerequisite on any DVD.<br /> But I digress. If you want to get some laugh and be sucked into a wonderful dark world where backstabbing, bitchery and vanity all collide in a beautifully shot and intricate story, this movie is for you. I enjoyed it immensely and my gut feeling tells me you will as well.ject matter which is a refusal to grow old gracefully.<br /> One thing though that irked me profoundly about this DVD though is the fact that the movie isn't available in widescreen format.

B000002UUX|5.0|What can I say? Rust In Peace is hands down, without a doubt, Dave Mustaine and company's crown jewel, the absolute pinnacle of their reign of metal mayhem. Having grown both personlay and musicaly, Megadeth show their true genius with the complexity and harmony of their riffs, accomponied by well thought out, insightful lyrics. This album, more than any other of its kind, defines true thrash/speed metal.<br />Song by Song review:<br />Holy Wars....The Punishment Due- My personal favorite, its so rare that a song can speak so much truth and still hold true 10 years later or more. Absolutly raw and utterly bonecrunching riffs, Holy Wars will leave you wanting more and more<br />Hangar 18- This was the song Megadeth were known for in the pre-symphony of destruction days. Mustaine and Friedman duel it out with guitar solos worthy of &quot;Crossroads&quot; fame, and once again rather intelligent lyrics<br />Take No Prisoners- Just pure anger and speed, cant really ask for much more on this one. David ellefson is brilliant on this one<br />Five Magics- The intro to this one is a well played bass riff, followed by the usual Mustaine string shredding. Good fast song.<br />Poison Was the Cure- Yet another example of supreme bass mastery, Ellefson shines again on a killer intro. This is the only point of the album that disappoints me lyricaly. Not because the lyrics are not good, rather they are not well spoken and get lost in the mix. But still a great tune, music picks up the slack here.<br />Lucretia- Just a good metal song that is sure to get your head bobbing up and down in the least....... dont pass this one up.<br />Tornado of Souls- Insane! Just when I think ive heard Dave's best he pulls this stuff out. Absolute brilliance on the guitar here, and a staple at any Megadeth concert. <br />Dawn Patrol- Mean as hell bass, nasty vocals, and Mustaine's  infamouls, cynical approach to the truth make this mellow jam a sleeper on the album. Did i mention that David Ellefson might know how to play the bass a little bit?<br />Rust in Peace...Polaris- Nick Menza really beats the tar out of the skins here......watch out Lombardo! In similar fashion to Holy Wars, R.I.P. is a well executed meatal massacre that also takes a political stand. But the end of the track is by far the pinnacle sound that this version of the Megadeth lineup put to record.<br />Every album I've ever owned has always had at least one track on it that i couldve not wasted my time on, but not here, not Rust in Peace. Now a dozen years after its release its still the album to have, and its the one that, in my opinion, set the standard for all metal bands. If you enjoy metal, in any way, shape or form, this is truly a must have.
0192833588|3.0|While a quick review of any NYT book review will make clear the many ways to evaluate the worth of a book, I've found that, with novels, 80% of my assessment can be delivered by answering two simple questions:  1) did I consistently desire to turn the page; i.e., did the narrative flow unremittingly retain my interest and curiosity, and 2) did the ending leave me with both the ethereal wish for the story to continue in perpetuity and lacking that, the more prosaic desire to immediately read it again.<br />I recently read Pride and Prejudice and, having answered both questions with a resounding \\"yes,\\" expected more of the same with Sense and Sensibility.  Unfortunately and very unexpectedly, I was disappointed.  The book was successful in holding my interest but in a far from fervent way.  Rather than caring deeply for the characters and anxiously awaiting the unfolding of their fates, my curiosity was clinical in nature, wondering at the outcome without particularly strong partisanship.  Compared to the convincingly developed, full-bodied relationships between Elizabeth and Darcy and Jane and Wickham in P&amp;P, those of Elinor and Edward and Marianne and Colonel Brandon come off as shallow, cold and flimsy.  To be fair, the ill-fated love of Marianne and Willoughby is carefully developed and generates sympathy.  However, the lack of substance behind the Elinor/Edward connection and the lack of credibility supporting the Marianne/Colonel Brandon match left the book's ending with a flatness that far from inspired the desire for a continuance.<br />The other missing factor that really set P&amp;P apart was the wry humor of Mr. Bennett.  While S&amp;S is not without similar elements, they are primarily limited to comments of the narrator and lose the effect of being embedded within the dialogue of the primary characters.<br />Is summary, this is not a book that you will put down with disinterest before finishing but is also not a work that will leave you exhilarated bythe experience.  I give it 3 stars.
B000002HMH|4.0|You know, Its absolutely mind boggling how closed minded and un-appreciative people can be. Metallica, a band where in the beginning had such a solid fan base, and come the black album a portion seemed to just turn their back and never look back. As I will say and other metallica fans have, metallica evolved and will continue to do so. One if not the main objective with any band should be to try and go onto new and different musical territories with every album that comes out. As a fairly new metallica fan, and an ever growing one I like both new and old metallica.  Although I do consider the old material to have a more...well timeless value to it.  <br />After 1991's the black album metallica took a five-year hiatus from releasing any new studio material. People grew suspicious and a backlash occurred when load hit in 1996. Where the black album came into metallica's evolution, they were no longer a thrash metal band, but a very well rounded hard rock band. <br />It is my opinion and belief and contrary to a popular one that load caught metallica at their most versile musical point yet. Hetfeild had a very good vocal range, Newsted's bass was more vibrant than even and show's very interesting bass riffs in such tunes as \\"king nothing\\" and \\"until it sleeps\\", Lars's drumming has a better range and Hammet's guitar playing was and is ever evolving. The point is people, bands change, metallica changed.  By when they released this album they were well into there mid 30's and it's illogical a band would not musically change in that instance. Unfortunately, metallica at the point of load's release were dammed if they did, and they were dammed if they didn't.<br />Load, in my opinion is much more diverse and show's metallica can do much more than thrash metal (and I am partial to thrash) and mix blues, hard rock, and alternative into a very solid album. The only problem is that load and re-load despite having great tunes also had their share of filler, songs like \\"cure\\" and\\"poor twisted me\\" are examples. Odd enough, re-load had twice as much filler. Songs like \\"the house that jack built\\", \\"until it sleeps\\", \\"Bleeding me\\" and \\"Ronnie\\" with it's led zeppelingish vibe are all great tunes.
B00008WG3U|5.0|This CD was soooo super rad, truly a great Cd. I can leave this cd in my discman and not worry about ever hitting a dull song because each song is really good, from franco-un american to mattersville, each song is unique, and it displays nofx's ability to be so versatile in what and how they play. Just an awesome Cd, definetly in my top 5 favorites.
B000002H97|5.0|As being a hardcore Metallica fan, owning all their albums this is one of the best, if not THE best one of all. Here's a rundown of all the songs:<BR>1.Enter Sandman 10/10-one of the best guitar riffs ever.<BR>2.Sad But True 10/10-very heavy riffs/drums.<BR>3.Holier Than Thou 7/10-not one of my favorites, but not bad nonetheless.<BR>4.The Unforgiven 15/10-Holy Jesus this is a awsome song, very powerful lyrics, my favorite 'Tallica song.<BR>5.Wherever I May Roam 10/10-another awsome song,first song that I memorized.<BR>6.Don't Tread On Me 10/10-heavy lyrics and guitar,sweet song.<BR>7.Through the Never 7/10-not a fav, but not terrible either.<BR>8.Nothing Else matters 8/10-not very heavy,but good lyrics.<BR>9.Of Wolf and Man 8/10-somewhat heavy, a good song still.<BR>10.The God That Failed 10/10 a heavy-riffs/heavy lyrics, phenominal song.<BR>11.My Friend of Misery 7/10, my least fav song but not bad by no means.<BR>12.The Stuggle Within 9/10 fast-paced heavy song, very good.<br />So that's a layout of all the songs of the album, as you see none are bad. All I can say is BUY THIS BAD@$$ ALBUM NOW!!!
B000002KAT|5.0|This is one of those CD's that you put in and just think &quot;WOW, DID I JUST FEEL THAT!&quot;.  Van Morrision sings with more feeling in this album, then almost any artist I have ever heard.  Truly a masterpiece.  You can just sit back and close your eyes and imagine what must have been going through his mind and body as he composed this album.
B00005B4GU|5.0|let me tell you, i bought this album today and it is my favorite radiohead album EVER and one of the best i own. Absolutely incredible. I started getting into radiohead this year(way too late!!) In February I bought OK Computer,which I would recommend as the first radiohead album anyone wanting to get in to them should listen to.Thats an amazing album as well. Then Kid A. Which is great and shows more of the techno aspect of Radiohead.Shortly after, The Bends, and finally today Amnesiac.<BR>Ever since I started to listen it has blown my mind. An incredible piece of work (not to mention the booklet that comes with it-they are really talented artists as well)Overall Amnesiac isnt as dark as Kid A (its commonly referred to as Kid B) and really stands out from any other Radiohead cd,I think. It does although, have a techo vibe like Kid A. This cd will blow your mind, I recommend it to anyone with an open mind in music.<BR>Im pleased to say,that after a less than a year of discovering them,Radiohead is my favorite band. It wont take long before youre taken aback by this beautiful music.<br />This is the order in which I think you should buy Radiohead albums:<br />Ok Computer(biggest hit of their career, but easiest album for people with less RH experience to get into)(its essential for a RH fan,or for any music collection in general)standout songs:Subterranean Homesick Alien,The Tourist,Let Down,Karma Police<BR>The Bends next probly it was in their earlier days. A lot of great songs like Fake Plastic Trees, High and Dry, Street Spirit, and others.<BR>Next Kid A (i definitly do not recommend this to be your first RH album, I know if it had been my first,it would have also been my last) Regardless, once you have a better understand of Rh music you will enjoy and appreciate this as much as the others. Standout songs- The National Anthem, Idiotheque(one of my very favorite songs),Optimistic, In Limbo.<BR>Then Amnesiac, the follow up to Kid A (this ones my personal favorite)this will be eays to grasp after Kid A. Standout songs:Knives Out, Pyramid Song, I Might Be Wrong,etc.<BR>And i wouldnt know about Pablo Honey as I dont own it.
B000003S5H|5.0|This is just good music. Just buy it and hear. If you get this, and I suggest that you do, I'm sure your tasteful little brain will like. You will hear wonderful music, I garauntee it.  <br />The first hit that you here, you'll think: &quot;Yes! Trip hop/whatever has been performed instead of looped!&quot; There is such a magical feal to it on the first catchy tune, and don't let the next few tracks (with singing) make you think that the purchase was just worth the first hit. That's what I thought: &quot;Was that the only one to give goose bumps?&quot; They turn out to be very good as well. The last three beautiful, just beautiful tracks on the album make for a big finish. I love everything, the melodies that they create, the sound that they make. It is some of my favorite music. I knew that as soon as my speakers started moving.<br />They play the instruments themselves, the french duo. GREAT job guys.
B000000P17|5.0|im a die hard gnr fan and this lp does not dissapiont.<BR>my favorites are Humin Being Raw Power hair of the dog and Since i dont have you. sorry for the short review but just take my word for it it is an really good lp.
B00000K19E|5.0|This movie is spectacular. It journey's into the un-explored world of science fiction, carrying the viewer into a parallel world of thrilling martial arts and fighting that gets you so riled up that you feel invincible. Magnificent mark in special effects as well. ITS GREAT
0380973839|4.0|The most important and startling (in a good way) thing about &quot;The Martian Chronicles&quot; is that Bradbury hasn't written a science fiction book. He has written a book about the human society. If you try to look at it as a science fiction book, you'll be greatly disappointed; I must say I cannot agree with the reviewers who say that he has depicted life on Mars (the details about it) in a vivid and fascinating way. Actually, the complete unlikeliness of a world like that makes the book a bit strange to read at times.<br />What makes this book so beautiful is the simple fact Bradbury doesn't write for the sake of writing. He writes because he has important things to say about the human way of life. Humans destroy everything noble and great around them; if that could bring money, they'd sell hot dogs at temples (in fact, don't they?). It is almost incomprehendible that he wrote this book in 1950; the problems discussed in it have reached and are reaching increasingly more epic proportions.<br />Aside from the fact that Bradbury is brilliant at expressing important ideas, he writes stories that make you want to read on and on at the same time. He uses inventive storylines and has a fascinating way of describing things that seem illogical or even completely absurd at the first glance (I'd provide details, but I refuse to spoil the wonderful experience of reading the stories for anyone...).<br />The only reason why I gave this book 4 stars instead of 5 is that among great (and I mean great!) stories there are some short ones that are of considerably lower quality than the rest. They're much less interesting than the others and keep me from pronouncing this book a masterpiece - a title that a considerable part of the book justly deserves.<br />All in all, I urge you to read this book. Perhaps you will not find much in it if you're looking for some credible science fiction, but you will find much to think about there - as well as simply a close-to-incredible read.
B000066NW0|3.0|Like when Nirvana came along to clean up the glam rock saturation of the early 90's, Avril Lavigne has come along to clean up the debris left behind from the recyclable teen pop scene.<br />Avril Lavigne &quot;Let It Go&quot; sounds like they tried to take the pop beat and give it a harder rocking edge. This is certainly not my cup of tea, but Avril has potential to be a great success. For a hint in the future, I would like to see more harder rocking tracks similar to &quot;Losing Grip&quot; and &quot;Sk8er Boi,&quot; the hardest of the rockers, not the rest of the album which consists of mid-tempo acoustic songs with a pop beat.
B000002UAO|5.0|&quot;Rubber Soul&quot; marks the end of one era and the beginning of another.  This album effectively marked the end of the Beatles as a moptop teenybopper quartet.  It signaled the beginning of the group as freewheeling experimental recording studio masterminds.<br />&quot;Rubber Soul&quot; is the last Beatles album which could conceivably be performed &quot;live&quot; on stage.  It is a very personal album since the Beatles, with the exception of George Martin and Mal Evans, played every note on it.  Post-&quot;Rubber Soul&quot; albums would feature tunes on which not one Beatle played a single note.<br />As a John Lennon fan, &quot;Rubber Soul&quot; is special because it spotlights John's talents better than any other album.  Especially compared with &quot;Revolver,&quot; where John sounds almost disconnected, &quot;Rubber Soul&quot; features Lennon at his witty, irreverent best!<br />I think &quot;Rubber Soul&quot; is a perfect choice as a first album for any new Beatles fan.  It salutes the past and fearlessly plunges into the future!
B000069CWE|3.0|Linkin Park is a pop band, but a fair one at that, and they have some creativity in them and it showed in Hybrid Theory and now in Reanimation, which while overall enjoyable is just really weird. Most of the tracks here are basically rap, but the beats are pretty horrible. There's also some clumsy techno elements that are flat out annoying. But considering this is Linkin Park, I can tolerate some of it. Many guest rappers also make an appearance, which approves the album immensily. Anyway, if you like Linkin Park, go and get the album. Just don't expect much 'rock' (as if LP ever did make rock) amd don't take it or Linkin Park seriously. Thumbs up.
0440237688|1.0|When I read this book I was in sixth grade.  First of all I had a horrible time figureing out what was going on in some parts of its twisted plot.  This was certainly the most depressing book I have ever read.  When I sit down to read I want to be enjoying myself and this book really did not do that.  Finally it is long.  It seemed like it took forever to get through this relatively short book.
B000002H2H|3.0|What we have here is an excellent record from Metallica.  Excellent for being the second LP to be released by this band.<br />I don't find it to be the best pre-black album like someone suggested; but a classic that has songs that have been favorites of mine since a teenager.  On a personal note, I own the LP, which I bought when I was 15 (1990).  After taking good care of it, I can say that the LP sounds incredibly good 12 or 13 years later - Amazing !<br />LP sound is for another discussion.  Anyway, there s so much to hoot for in this record.  The first two songs, and the final tune 'Kall of ktulu'.  Those three tunes are timeless compositions done with collaboration from all band members.  This being the 2nd LP, doesn t feature the all out potency and violence we see later on Master of Puppets and ''Justice.  What Master of Puppets was a coming of age for this group, Ride.. was a good adolescence.  Very intelligent and well crafted.<br />I need say more about this record.  It is a must own for the true metal fan.  And to the never-met-in person members of Metallica whom I saw live a couple of times, this was a true masterpiece.  You should be VERY proud.
B00008RH3L|1.0|Don't waste your money on this one; probably the most ridiculous period film I've ever seen.  The hero goes through the film absorbing beating after incredible beating(including an impossible number of blows accompanied by hurtling down multiple flights of stairs) but emerges virtually unscathed(save for a split lip) every time.  The Italian mobster character is woefully over-played...and on, and on. How anyone could even mention this sorry film in the same review with &quot;Road to Perdition&quot; escapes me.  Definitely pass on this one...I'm going to sell my copy.
B000001YOW|4.0|I would tend to write a review on this album with a bit of caution.  In my opinion it is not the best PT album.  That's my objective opinion.  But it is one of their best (records).  Up the downstair, The sky moves sideaways, and this are candidates to be some of the best material they put out.<br />This is the album before the so called 'catchy' or 'commercial' side the band came to be later.  Although their more accesible material is brilliant and deserving A LOT of praise.  It is pure joy this band made it to the U.S. finally to play live and have their material marketed more widely than before, because they deserve to be heard by many audiences, and the U.S.'s is one of the biggest (considering population density).<br />Anyway, let me give you a run down on this album which is pretty good and clocks in at around 60 min.  The opener 'Bornlivedie' is an elctronic/sample type of intro to the album, Pretty appropriate I think.  Next the title track, strong.<br />After about 20 or 25 more minutes of music we tend to see and judge that Steve Wilson along w the rest of the group are making quite good music.  Very Porcupine tree.  'light mass prayers' is a favorite.  A light, futuristic Gregorian chant type of song, which floats in and out making the mood very spacy.  this gives way to a great track 'Dark matter.  Cool lyrics about some of the 'dark matter' that some and lots of mass and local media (newspapers, TV stations) do and say to get the public s preference.  Smart song.<br />All I would say other than this, is to go and buy the rest of the PT catalog.  Everything from Voyage 34 on up is worth purchasing.  Cheers.
B00005JLWN|5.0|If you don't see Equilibrium, something is obviously wrong with you.  Or you're opposed to violence in movies, which is a stupid position.  Everyone should see this movei, the fight scenes are spectacular, and there's little better than one guy killing 6 futuristic SWAT troopers in a circle around him with only dual pistols.  Also, while the fight scenes were my favorite part, the plot had no obvious holes and was not lacking in any way.  When i saw it, Equilibrium immediately reminded me of \\"Fahrenheit 451\\" by Ray Bradbury, which is an excellent book.  However, Equilibrium evolved to be more than just a book-burning film, and i must say, kicked booty.
6303443214|5.0|The old vampire movies are not my cup of tea. Dracula in black and white is boring and lame. Not scary or thought proking, as was the book by Bram Stroker. Interview With The Vampire is a different story, though. As most of you know, Interview With The Vampire is based on the book by Anne Rice. The book is better, but the movie is great in itself. <br />The movie's beginning takes place in the present. Louis, played by Pitt, tell his life story to an interviewer, Slater, who's name we never find out. Although, in later books by Rice you find out it's Daniel. Most of the movie, I'd say about an hour and a half, is a flash back. You learn about Louis' compainion and maker Lestat, played by Cruise. Lestat is so evil and charming most can't decide whether to love him or hate him. Tom Cruise does a wonderful job as Lestat. Lestat and Louis make a vampire child, Claudia who is played by Dunst. Dunst is fabolous as Claudia. It's a shame that's the best acting she's ever done in her whole career to date. <br />This story is a sad and beautiful one. Although there is some nudity, voilence, gore, and death this movie is not trash at all. It has all the elements of a good movie. It makes you laugh, cry, and think. Most movies today can't make you think. The only problem is you become very wrapped up in this movie. <br />I'd recommend this movie to anyone. I watch it all the time and love it more and more everytime I watch it. Everyone who I know whose seen it, wants to watch it again. It truly is a good movie.
0385493622|5.0|It was a pleasure reading every page of this book. The book delves into the making of scientific discoveries. A portrayal of how both the mind and soul of researchers get involved in the quest for knowledge. The book's contents reflects author's in depth research into the subject. In the pretext of describing about Fermat's theorem, the author outlines how the field of mathematics advances. The presentation is very gripping. Instead of choosing to 'tell' what Fermat's enigma is, and how it was solved, the author develops a plot akin to that found in fiction. As a reader one gets involved with the characters, where infact the characters are the mathematicians who were involved in some way or the other with Fermat's problem. It provides insights to how knowledge really grows incrementally with many contributors on its way. This makes the presence of every mathematician in the book highly significant. I recommend this book to everyone who is seeking a well researched book of an extremely challenging mathematical problem, written in a manner that motivates the reader to appreciate the path of scientific discoveries.
B00008972S|3.0|This magnificent film is truly ageless.  I won't bother discussing the plot as so many others have.  I simply wish to call your attention to the sound quality of the otherwise perfect <BR>DVD.  In a word, the sound &quot;stinks.&quot;  Far more attention should have been paid to such a crucial element of this film.  It's muddy and poorly mixed, especially during the musical numbers.  Or perhaps it's just a sloppy digital transfer.  Happily, the picture quality is excellent.  So, why was so little attention paid to sound?  It's a mystery.
B000002J1S|5.0|July 2010: For all of us Lamb fans. The band The Musical Box is playing The Lamb in the Usa and Canada this year with Genesis and Gabriel's blessing. DO NOT MISS IT. Pass the word. I already got my tickets for San Francisco. We saw the original in '74 and want to experience it again. They will be playing the East/South East early next year...<br /><br />I was one of the privileged to see the Lamb Live in 1974 and since then is still My Favorite Recording Ever . An Under Rated Classic of Master Pieces . Up there with any Opera U like . One of my wishes is for Genesis to release The Lamb with only the music , to listen to all those minute interpretations . Oh well , enjoy . Pekax oo3 .
B000001DYJ|3.0|Alive III is an okay live album, but doesn't compare to Alive! or Alive II. The album isn't as raw as their previous live albums as it features heavy studio overdubbing. In addition, four of the tracks were already featured on Alive! or Alive II. The album also ends with an unnecessary rendition of the Star Spangled Banner, which has been done numerous times before. There are many strong tracks here though such as \\"I Was Made For Lovin' You\\", \\"Heaven's On Fire\\", \\"Lick It Up\\", and \\"Unholy.\\" The album also contains three tracks from one of their strongest studio albums, Creatures Of The Night. A rawer production and more songs from Lick It Up and Animalize, as well as the track \\"Tears Are Falling\\", would have made this a stronger album.
B00005JKZT|5.0|In a world where the next epic movie determines and actors success in his career \\"Lord of the Rings: The Two Towers\\" has given all of its cast members and opportunity to be great. Every actor whether old or young, small part in a scene or large part in a scene brought their character to life.  The effort that the directors and producers put into this movie makes them the basis of life for this movie.  They are the roots.  Congratulations!
B000001FQQ|3.0|Hot In The Shade was to be a return to form after the lackluster Asylum and Crazy Nights albums. While the album is stronger than both of them, it's not quite up to their mid-70s or early-80s albums. Many bands at this time started making albums that contained as many as 15 songs, choosing quantity over quality. This album is a good example. If they took the filler out and cut it down to a 10 or 11 song album, it would have been much better. The first half of the album is the stronger half. Some of Gene Simmons' songs, such as \\"Betrayed\\", \\"Prisoner of Love\\", and \\"Love's A Slap in The Face\\", are his best since the Lick It Up album. Paul contributes perhaps his best power ballad, the hit single \\"Forever\\", as well as the strong singles \\"Rise To It\\" and \\"Hide Your Heart.\\" Eric Carr also contributes the song, \\"Little Caesar\\", which is also among the better tracks. Then there's the filler. \\"King Of Hearts\\", \\"Read My Body\\", \\"Cadillac Dreams\\", \\"Love Me to Hate You\\", and \\"Somewhere Between Heaven and Hell\\" are not up to par. Take these songs off and it's easily a 4-star album. Not quite a return to form, but a decent album.
B00005QHPQ|4.0|I flock to Enrique's music because I am a fan.  Any song he does usually is my favorite.  Although in an interview he said that people would only want him because of his music, I don't believe that.  I would have loved to have met him.  &quot;Bygones&quot;!  This album was good but will never be as good as the one with &quot;Be With You&quot; anyway if he can I want to be his &quot;Hero&quot;.
0767800958|5.0|I absolutely loved it because it's an adult love story told from an adult point of view. The two main characters have strong personalities, and because of their occupations, are used to being in control. They learn that in life, sometimes you lead and sometimes you follow. The cinematography is perfect; you only see what needs to be on screen, nothing superfuous. The same can be said about the dialogue. Sally Potter was involved in every aspect of her film: directing, writing, acting, dancing, writing music/lyrics, and singing. There is great chemistry between the two main characters and the music and dancing are wonderful. You won't be sorry you purchased it. The music will make you raptuous and the dancing will inspire you to dance.
B00008WG3U|5.0|For a bunch of 30 somethings pushing 40 this album kicks butt.  You gotta keep in mind that these guys were touring and sleeping on floors all across the country when alot of us were in elementary school.  That said, fat mike can shove his street cred right down anybodies throat whenever he pleases.  NOFX is one of the few punk bands that have based their entire career on the D.I.Y. ethos that a lot of punk bands claim to live by.  They even spit in MTV's eye back in the mid-ninties, see the Heavy Petting Zoo lyric sheet, last page.  They earned the title \\"Kings Of Punk\\" for a reason.  They are the only band that I know of that has consistently put out consecutive records without breaking up and makeing very few lineup changes, which occured in the very beginning of a career that spans three decades and two millenium.  They are one of the only bands I know of that their previous albums are still relevant in todays world as they were when released and they still sound fresh, not dated.  If you feel the need to criticize them than go ahead, they could really care less what some teenager or twenty-something thinks about there music, they've already proved themselves, and I'm pretty sure the only thing they care about now is having fun, not maintaining any sort of image.
B000002GJ7|5.0|I found this in dads CD collection amongst hordes of 70's, 80's and 90's music, and i just think this band are brilliant, Nuno Bettencourt is a hard act to follow, and i find that they are one of times forgotten rock bands, the talent they have was second to none, flight of the bumble bee on guitar... now that is 100% raw skill... there are very few bands that catch my eye, Extreme got my undivided attention!! 6/5 if you like rock then u really need to buy this CD Bettencourt is god! :)
B000089A07|3.0|Red Dragon, the third in the series of flicks featuring Dr. Hannibal &quot;the Cannibal&quot; Lecter is merely okay as a psychological thriller.  I found the character development, particularly that of Francis &quot;The Red Dragon&quot; Dolarhyde to be superficial, with Dr. Lecter's character the notable exception.<br />The story was an intriguing one but for the most part the characters seemed to be made of cardboard.  Ed Norton, one of the finest young contemporary actors, as the FBI profiler was meek and whiny.  Ralph Fiennes, a brilliant classical actor seemed uninspired as the driven and diabolical killer.  Anthony Hopkins was brilliant, as usual, as the cultured, refined yet horrific Dr. Lecter.  Harvey Keitel was nothing special but Anthony Heald as the self serving and loathsome Dr. Chilton was terrific.<br />With a wonderful cast to work with director Brett Ratner came up short in his shallow adaptation of Thomas Harris' chilling novel.
B00008NG5V|5.0|Jack Johnson, despite having a name that everyone confuses (Joe Jackson, John Jackson, Jim Johnson -- let's just call him JJ) has put together an absolutely fresh, charming and thoroughly enjoyable little gem in this CD.  16 songs, most only 2 minutes in length, all with a feel-good groove that's hard to explain.  I salute musicians who are able to produce simple but compelling music (like Norah Jones).  Nothing here is over-produced. Just a clever (but not too clever) songwriter with a silky smooth voice, hip lyrics, backed with strong and creative acoustic guitar work.  This is easily the best CD I've purchased this year.  I play it in my car and wait for people's reaction.  The music is instantly infectious and everyone asks &quot;Who's this?&quot;.
0060537639|3.0|If your reading tends toward investigations of extra-terrestrial visitations, I highly recommend this book. Appropriate to this genre, the speculations are highly iconoclastic and experiments to collaborate the conclusions are easily imagined.<br />If you are looking for contradictions to 'classic' European narrative history, the book will please but could have been much shorter. A 30 page magazine article could get most of the points across.<br />I probably enjoy both lines of thought more than I should admit.<br />Unfortunately, the author fails to investigate the existing histories of the 'treasure ship' voyages. Rather than provide me with a commentary on his travels to distant sites while researching the book, I would have much preferred he argue the strengths of his case against those of other historians. The author acts like a lone reporter investigating a conspiracy of silence. While few English speakers profess much interest in Chinese history, the field is not a vacuum.<br />I wish the author knew more about the art of writing history. In summary, the book raises some interesting issues. If it had been written in the 'historical' genre rather than the 'extra-terrestrial' style, it might inspire more interest in Chinese history.
B00005JL3A|3.0|Fun flick, but one minor complaint...<br />I am not a huge fan of the Zombie genre, but enjoy them quite a bit.  I understand the \\"rules\\" and like watching a movie that works well within it's own particular idiom.  I can say the same about Romantic Comedies, Documentaries and Action Adventure flicks.  When they're done well I enjoy the heck out of them.<br />That having been said, Resident Evil compares favorably among it's fellows.  I'm not going to discuss plot because there are a few hundred reviews posted here on Amazon that explain pretty much everything.  Besides, you really don't want me to ruin it, do you? <br />There is more action than gore, but it's pretty graphic action so Argento freaks may not walk away happy but the rest of us will have a good time.  There is an Aliens type feel to the elite military team, but the characters are very broadly sketched and there's not a lot of feeling for them as they fall victim to the beasts and nasties that inhabit the lair beneath the mansion.  Still, seeing a few hundred zombies ganging up on five or six well trained commandoes makes up for the lack of characterization.<br />As far as the effects go, my only complaint is the CGI work on the most monstrous of the beasties.  The concept was excellent, but the execution left a bit to be desired.  Resident Evil is based on a computer game and the monster looked like he was lifted right off a Playstation and dropped onto the set.  I actually chuckled at one point when he was climbing up a wall and looking over his shoulder.  My finger automatically sought out a fire button to waste his sorry behind.<br />All that having been said I do have one major complaint about this flick.  Are we supposed to believe that these folks live in a world where there has not been a single zombie movie ever made?  Reanimated dead folks, shambling through corridors trying to eat human flesh and none of these crack commandoes have the presence of mind to try a head shot?  I know with small arms it's advisable to shoot for the center of the target, but how many rounds do you put into something's chest before you try another target?  It's a small complaint, I know, but just once I wish a character in one of these movies would have seen a Romero movie some time in their life.<br />Long and short of it; decent effects save one CGI character, a decent plot and wall to wall zombie killing action...  I can think of worse ways to spend a Saturday night.
078322687X|4.0|I saw BC twice before, but many years ago.  U have always wanted to own it.  Unprepared to wait for the 25 Anniversary DVD, I bought this barebones DVD release.  To be fair, this DVD was released in 1998 when the format was quite new.  I'll get to the DVD issues later.<BR>BC is a fantastic film focussing on 5 teenagers who have to do detention on a Saturday at school. The character development is brilliant as is the acting.  The narrative is simple yet compelling.  <br />DVD SUMMARY:<br />As mentioned above, this DVD came out in 1998.  It is a basic DVD with poor features (and some typing errors too). The movie is Widescreen 1:85 but not anamorphic - despite this, picture quality is ok.  The black bars are rather large though, if you have a 16:9 TV you may be able to minimise these.<br />The sound quality is the DVD's biggest let-down.  Mono city, and does it show!  Sounds so flat and can be hard to hear what characters are saying in some scenes.  <br />But even with these letdowns, the DVD is worth owning for the film alone.  It is a film you will want to watch over and over.  I'll also be buying the 25th Anniversary DVD if it eventuates.
B000002C2E|5.0|I've been an owner of this CD for almost six years. I just picked it up again after a while of being dormant, and it has relodged itself in my CD player.<BR>How does Dylan write songs these? They are built on riddles, enigmas, twisted images, snippets of old blues songs, personal experience and amazing couplets. Yet, when they are interpreted through his beautiful bullfrog croak, his band and the production, it seems like they have come straight out of some mythic time or place of America. It is like the Oracle of American music sounding down from the mountain about his melanchoy, his detachment, and his age. But the honesty and clarity of the songs are such that they don't make the listener morose, but instead make you feel uplifted and inspired.<BR>Just remarkable. If you at all like Dylan, and dont think that good singing equates with everyone sounding like Sinatra or Cooke, then buy this.
B00006JDVV|3.0|The dragons in this movie are kind of like Superman. They can fly about three hundred miles an hour (breaking the laws of physics a few times), melt a tank with their fiery breath, and generally cause massive destruction. These dragons supposedly defeated the entire world military in a few months! How did they defeat the battleships, by the way? US warships have vulcan cannons with an auto-targeting system capable of shooting down a missile in flight. Large flying creatures, such as eagles and pteratactyles, cannot fly fast. They have to depend upon gliding to stay aloft (just like the ones portrayed in the book, Abacar the Wizard).<br />Anyway, the movie is entertaining. It's worth renting if you enjoy watching survival monster-type movies. I just think that they made the dragons waaaaay too powerful. Matthew McConaughey does a fantastic job playing a &quot;tough guy&quot; military commander in this film.
B00000DLUV|5.0|I am a 12 year old music fan and the year this came out me and my mom had watched this concert on PBS. It was great and I had to have the CD. So she bought it for me for Christmas. I played this CD until it broke in half. I usually write a track-by-track review but most Bee Gees fans know these songs and I'll just say most of them sound better live.
0140186409|4.0|I am a high school student, and i had to read this book for my english class.  This book is very accurate in depicting the events that occured when the great depression was at its peak.  It is easy to read, steinbeck does not use big words :)  .  I would recommend this book for any american reader!
B000002JSZ|5.0|This CD is explosive and every song on it is really good.  Bedlam in Belgium and the title tracks are my favorite.  Had Mutt Lange produced it, 10 million copies would have been sold instead of the 2M.  Brian lost his voice completely after this CD.  I think trying to sing high like Bon was never his strong suit.  I think every fan wishes they would play one song off of here in concert.
0156027321|4.0|I thoroughly enjoyed this work, which takes us along the journey of an ordinary (albeit precocious) young man thrown into extraordinary circumstances.  For those readers who may pick this up and find themselves perplexed in the first 50 or so pages: keep reading. Soon enough you will be pulled in and you will not want to put the book down. I found myself thinking about this story for weeks after I had finished reading it. The link between animal instinctual nature and one's spiritual nature was presented well within a rather simple tale. There has been much discussion about whether or not this book &quot;may make you believe in God&quot;. That may be an exaggeration, but it will at least make you think about the human need and yearning for tangible answers when unbelievable things happen. This story often takes turns that are quite unbelievable - yet remains oddly palpable at the same time. That's the whole point.
B000002JS6|5.0|Words cannot simply describe how good this CD is.  The bands precision focus mourning Bon's death and Brian Johnson basically singing as if someone had him by the balls is unmatched by any CD that was ever produced.  Brian did all he could to pay tribute to Bon and sang higher and higher and even higher then Bon ever sang...........Hells Bells opening lines - I'm rollin thunder, pourin rain, i'm comin on like a hurricane, white lightening is flashing across the sky, your only young, but your gonna die, wont take no prisoners, wont spare no lives, knowbodys puting up a fight, im gonna take, take it to you, hell bells........... Shoot to thrill is my favorite and is just simply brilliant singing and guitar work.  You will never grow tired of this CD, I swear it gets better with age.  I often wonder if there were possibly any songs that didn't make the final cut and you have to figure are better then anything they did since this CD.  I have often heard that Angus and Malcom with Bon on drums recorded three songs from this CD.  Hail Bon.
0790749815|5.0|In a way, NORTH BY NORTHWEST is a glorious remake.  Although he hadn't filmed this particular story before, Hitchcock had often told the story of a man falsely accused of a murder he did not commit forced to travel long distances in search of the real murderer and the proof of his own innocence.  Both THE 39 STEPS and YOUNG AND INNOCENT in his English period featured such a hero, and he continued this in his Hollywood film SABOTEUR, with Robert Cummings traveling all the way from the West Coast to the Statue of Liberty.  But NORTH BY NORTHWEST is a remake as well in that in this film he pulled out all the tricks he had honed and mastered over the years.  After this film, he would actually invent new forms of shocking and surprising his viewers.<br />Bernard Hermann is almost without debate the greatest film composer.  Which film features his greatest work, however, is open to debate.  Probably most would give the nod to his extraordinary score for PSYCHO, but my own vote would go for NORTH BY NORTHWEST.  This music is so extraordinary that it has actually been assembled into a suite that is sometimes performed by symphony orchestras.  Although Hermann could vary dramatically from score to score (compare his work on VERTIGO with that on CITIZEN KANE or PSYCHO), here he can vary sharply from scene to scene.  I know of no more exhilarating score in film.<br />Nonetheless, when Hitchcock filmed the most famous scene in the film, he used no music at all.  What makes the classic crop duster scene work so magnificently is the silence in which he embeds it.  This is one of the most influential scenes in the history of film, not least because of the patience he displays in allowing it to unfold.  Compare this scene with the beginning of Sergio Leone's ONCE UPON A TIME IN THE WEST, and you find the same kind of patience in allowing the action to take place at a snail's pace.  I'm not aware of any director who took such time to wait on things to unfold so gradually for an action scene before NORTH BY NORTHWEST.  It becomes common afterwards.<br />Hitchcock was truly one of the great cultural wonders of the modern world.  When he made this film, he had been turning out great classic films for over thirty years.  Yet, he would go on to make even more classics like PSYCHO, THE BIRDS, and FRENZY.  I personally like NORTH BY NORTHWEST as much as any of his films (though several manage to tie it in my affections, like NOTORIOUS and THE 39 STEPS).  It has all his trademarks, from suspense to humor to hairbreadth escapes to the mild dirty jokes he was fond of (see the film's final shot).on scene before NORTH BY NORTHWEST.

B000022TSH|5.0|The success of THE PIANIST recalls Roman Polanski's glory days, when in just over a decade he turned out such stunning classics like KNIFE IN WATER, REPULSION, THE FEARLESS VAMPIRE KILLERS, ROSEMARY'S BABY, and this film, CHINATOWN.  One thing all these films have in common is the great difficulty the main character has in each film in discovering what is appearance and what is reality, perhaps in the end discovering that reality is an illusion.  CHINATOWN is a detective film that isn't.  In the usual detective film, the gumshoe follows a string of clues and in the end is able to assert order over chaos by \\"solving\\" the mystery.  In CHINATOWN, on the other hand, Jack Nicholson's J. J. Gittes solves the mystery only to uncover the incomprehensible and the unfathomable.  Instead of asserting the primacy of order over chaos, the chaos engulfs him, visually represented by the crowding of Asians around Gittes in the films' closing shot.  \\"Chinatown,\\" where the final shot takes place, becomes a metaphor for the inscrutable and opaque quality of life itself.<br />This is a meticulously made film, and it is susceptible to analysis at a very deep level.  For instance, it isn't accidental that at one point Faye Dunaway tells Nicholson, upon noticing a discoloration in her eye, that it is a flaw in the iris.  Later, that is the eye through which she is shot and killed.<br />The plot is very, very loosely based on the life of William Mulholland, who was responsible for building the viaduct that brought water to LA from Owens Valley.  That real life incident took place several decades earlier than the time in which CHINATOWN was set, but with the central role that water has played in the Los Angeles's, the incident was well chosen.  The part involving Faye Dunaway and her daughter had, thank god, no counterpart in Mulholland's life.<br />It is almost impossible to say of an actor like Jack Nicholson that one role is his finest, but one can at least state that his turn as Jake Gittes is one of his very finest performances.  His fortitude in the face of moral horror provides the foundation for the narrative, and his collapse upon looking into the heart of the void at the end of the film establishes precisely the right tone.  If we weren't ourselves horrified and crushed at the end, we would be merely by gazing into his stunned and bewildered face.  Similarly, Faye Dunaway was as good as she would ever be as Evelyn Mulray.  John Huston managed to create one of the vilest characters in the history of film, while Roman Polanski himself managed to be one of the scariest.  The scene where Polanski cuts Nicholson's nose is rightfully remembered as one of the most vivid in the movies.<br />Unfortunately, after this film Polanski's string of great films came to an end, those following in the next couple of decades ranging from decent to out and out awful.  Hopefully his resurrection with THE PIANIST will signal a return to form of one of the most interesting directors of the 1960s.ttes is one of his very finest performances.

B0000931OG|4.0|It is hard for every rock band to lose a guitarist.  They have two choices, get a new guitar player or face a challenge, adapt musically without one of their great strengths. Blur lost their guitarist but they have managed to create an album that is one of their bests.  Damon Albarn is the dominant force of this album.  His musical projects like Gorillaz and side projects have influence him to produce his song more electronic base in sound.  Norman Cook of &quot;Fat boy slim&quot; also co produced this album.  So what you get are mellow tracks like &quot;Caravan&quot;, &quot;Out of time&quot;, and &quot;Sweet song&quot;. These songs are very pretty with exquisite piano melody, ryhthmic guitar and great bass line.  The drummings are not loud per se, they are steady and go with the flow.  Some fans may find these songs are too laid back cause Blur used to be a rock anthem, energetic band with tunes like &quot;SONG 2&quot;.  Well there are a few songs that have the vibe of rock out tunes.  &quot;Crazy Beats&quot; and &quot;We got a file on you&quot;.  Crazy beats come of with a synthezier robotic voice that keep on repeating &quot;cray beats, crazy beats&quot; it makes you want to nod your head along with the drum beats.  Then blur just rock out with the nostalgic of Coxon's guitar.  Personally, &quot;We got a file on you&quot; is the worst song Blur have ever written.  Eventhough the track is only 50 seconds, it would take me more than 50 seconds to recover of what I hear.  The song is like today radio punk bands &quot;they think they are punk&quot;: &quot;Dashboard Confessional, Good Charlotte, Simple Plan&quot;.  The song just comes out with a good guitar intro but PAINFULLY RUINED with it typical today punk band shout out chorus &quot;WE GOT A FILE ON YOU, WE GOT A FILE ON YOU +5x&quot;.  Well that's the only track I couldn't bear.  The rest of the albums have great tracks with 4/4 drum beats.  They could be good driving songs, or something that put you in a very good mood.  I enjoy THINK TANK, it's a mellow out blur that write catchy songs that make you feel good.
0790729342|5.0|I first saw this film in the spring of 1981, immediately after hearing Siskiel and Ebert rave about this follow up to another Australian film I hadn't yet seen.  I was game, and the second I saw it I was hooked.  I had seen movies before that dealt with the world \\"after they dropped the bomb,\\" but never before had any of those films had such style and attitude.  It wasn't until I saw THE MATRIX in 1999 that I was to see another futuristic film that would have as much of edge.  Even today, this movie has a power and primal simplicity that few can match.<br />Storywise, the film had a great deal in common with other films--especially Westerns--that feature an anti-social loner as the central hero.  Mel Gibson's \\"Mad\\" Max Rockatansky (a role he will be reprising next year in MAX MAX IV) is almost a copy of Clint Eastwood's Man With No Name, except that in this instance we know his name and we know something about what made him made from the first film.  Mel Gibson makes this movie work.  His laconic self-isolation, his cynicism, his lack of anything except a grim determination to continue to survive and find another liter of petrol gives the film a magnificent bleakness.  To be honest, it isn't quite easy to tell why he is the good buy and not just as bad as the gang of the Humongous, why he isn't as bad as Vernon Welles's Wez.  But we accept it, and in the end he turns out to have been on the right side.<br />I heard George Miller interviewed once about the music used in the film.  Despite the punkish look that nearly every character in the film assumes, the music is bland, uninteresting orchestral music, just barely above the level of Musak.  According to Miller, this was intentional.  He felt that in some movies, the music draws attention away from the action, so he used music that was almost impossible to focus upon, forcing all the attention back on to what was happening onscreen.  Oddly enough, since then the music has become more interesting to me than it had before.<br />I know this is a bit of heresy to hardcore Mad Max fans, but of the three films made so far, this one remains by far my favorite.  The third was watchable, but not really very good, and the first one, while good, lacked the simplicity of story that I think makes this second film so great.  Also, I find the undubbed version to be almost impossible to make out at times, and the dubbed version sounds far too silly.  But maybe I prefer the second because I saw it first, and so many times since.fore.<br />I know this is a bit of heresy to hardcore Mad Max fans, but of the three films made so far, this one remains by far my favorite.

B000069HKH|3.0|The Rising is incredibly over-rated. The kudos for this record appear to be based on the substance and the timing of the record as it relates September 11. Unfortunately, rock n roll and substance are incompatible. Musically, this is the same drab self-indulogent crap that Springsteen has put out since Born in the USA. The novelty of Springsteen's first two records were that the songs were too long to play on the radio. He had a cult following. Born to Run launched him into the public eye, and he hs deteriorated ever since. His new record is a obvious attempt to make a commercial come-back and to profit from September 11.
B00003CXSP|1.0|After seeing Gladiator, I thought it was cool that someone was going to do another Roman movie.  The Punnic Wars being one of the key battles for supremacy of the Mediterranean.  Rome had one city standing in the way of its domination and that city was Carthage.  There were three battles.  One of the battles involved a Carthaginian general named Hannibal.<BR>This movie had me a bit confused as I was waiting for the climatic scene with the elephants crossing the Alps.  Especially since parts of it were shot in Rome.  Nor did I see any Centurions for that matter.<BR>Anyways, I didn't really care for this movie.  It didn't seem like it had a plot other than trying to gross the heck out of the audience.  Whatever.
B00006WL2B|1.0|I haven't been able to play the SACD layers of this disc yet, - that has to wait until the planned purchase of an SACD player next year. However, I have played the (16 bit, ordinary) CD layer and it is terrible, - dull, opaque and a far, far worse transfer than any previous CD incarnation of this performance. It's as if DG just tossed it on. Unlike Philips, their Universal classics stable-mates, whose CD layers are high quality, DSD (re)mastered 24 bit (re-)recordings, DG have missed the quality-boat. I, for one, will refuse to buy any further DG SACDs until they announce a change of heart and policy about CD layers on hybrid discs. ONLY buy this if you have an up and running SACD player. DON'T buy this if you're expecting a re-mastered hi-quality stereo CD. Shame on you DG, shame!!
B0000071J0|5.0|I've never been especially fond of most classically based, orchestral, cliched progressive (&quot;Prog.&quot;)  Among Italian musicians gimme Picchio dal Pozo (two CDs available here, please order them promptly - you will not regret it) over PFM any time.  Gimme any R.I.O. band over almost anything with a Roger Dean cover.  (Sorry, Roger.)<br />Le Orme overcomes any pitfalls inherent to the style.  The music is dark and powerful;  romantic and magisterial;  Power without bombast.  Melody without saccharin.<br />OK.  I admit it.  I first bought Felona e Sorona when it came out in the early 70s because of the cover.  (Wadda ya want?  I was just out of adolescence.)  Over the years I have kept up with Le Orme and, while this remains my favorite work by them, they have never disappointed.<br />Jon Anderson's voice makes me break out in hives.  I recognize that what makes no sense at all is that despite a certain superficial similarity between the two voices,  I LOVE Aldo Tagliapietra's.<br />Buy this great work and after listening to it all the way through the first time, A/B the andante passage of Felona and Van der Graaf's Theme One.
0385504209|5.0|It was great to finally read a thriller that made you think versus the typical detective fights serial killer type novel. Brown posits a fascinating hypothesis on religion. Although some may consider this anti-religious I consider it an interesting historical theory. Whether true or not, it does make you consider the possibilities of an historical relevation that is contrary to religious teachings but plausible.<br />This book is difficult top put down as my late nights and tired mornings at work prove. I learned a lot about history and art, more than can be said about the average best-selling mystery or thriller.

B000089RVX|1.0|&quot;Bring Me To Life&quot; is the worst song I've ever heard that gets so much attention. It's a crying shame horrible groups like Evanescence get so much attention.

B000066NW0|1.0|Avril Lavigne is an example of how far computers have gotten. I do agree that her songs are catchy and fun but when she's live, her voice is incredibly raspy and terrible. What you do is take an average Canadian girl and use a computer to create her voice, make millions of dollars, and then throw her out of your company. Second, Lavigne is a disgrace to both punk and rock. While rock and punk lyrics are supposed to discuss anger, depression, and sadness, Avril Lavigne sings about her boyfriend dumping her or the other way around. She's a failure and her lyrics fully support that. 1 star.
0440236738|5.0|&quot;The childhood shows the man, as morning shows the day.&quot; John Milton (1608-1674) This novel has more twists and turns than a Daedalian Labyrinth. It kept me guessing to it's very satisfying end. Be sure to read it, you will love the ride!
B00006LI4S|5.0|This is one of my all time favorite dvds. Gilmour's guitar playing is as good as Clapton. I know it is basically acoustic guitar but it is simply mind blowing work. Everything about this show is excellent. I love Pink Floyd and I sure am glad that I found this one. Roger Water's &quot;In The Flesh&quot; is still my favorite in this genre but this is a close second. Don't miss this one!!
B00009NHC5|5.0|When I got my DVD player, this was one of the first movies I looked into buying.  I'm so glad it's finally on the way.  While I wouldn't call it a horror movie, it is one of the scariest films I've ever seen.  There is one scene that makes me jump a mile every time I see it, even though I know exactly what's coming.  Audrey Hepburn and Richard Crenna do an excellent job, and Alan Arkin makes for a classic creep.  I would recommend this movie to anyone who likes a good thriller.  Just make sure you have a pillow to grab onto for those scary moments!

B000002LIX|5.0|Almost 13 years since its release and I still want to cry every time I listen to Ritual de lo Habitual.  Blending rock, jazz, reggae, California punk and various other musical styles, Ritual de lo Habitual manages to take the listener away to a special place.  I truly believe anybody can appreciate Janes Addiction.  Even my sister, a fan of mostly hiphop, reggae and old classic rock has somehow managed to become intrigued by Janes Addition.  I bought her all their albums and hope that she's able to hear in them what I do.<br />Ritual starts fast and ends slow. The first few songs are fast and furious, and then comes Three Days.  Anybody who disses Three Days has a serious problem.  That song alone floors me every time.  Obvious and No One's Leaving make me bust out into a karaoke routine when I am alone.  They end on a calm note with Classic Girl. <br />Perry's interest in art shines through in his lyrics.  His delivery is clear and easy to understand.  I hope you have all had a chance to see them live.  Perry is one of the most interesting live performers I've ever seen.  Dave Navaro, a fabulous and extremely talented guitarist is both powerful and soothing.   Steven Perkins is one of the best drummers alive.  Try and pay attention to his drumming when you listen.  Imagine playing that fast with some many different time changes?<br />If you've never given a Janes Addiciton a full listen you can't go wrong with either Nothing's Shocking or Ritual de lo Habitual.  I really can't decide which one I like better!

0767800958|4.0|The film as a film justly explores the politics of tango and is well directed.  The film may lead the uninitiated to believe a student could reach such an advanced level of dance in such a short period of time.  However . . . it is a film produced as entertainment.<br />All in all - for tango lovers, the dance scenes are worth watching again and again.
B00008S2VG|4.0|After reading many reviews, I've come to the conclusion that fans of Madonna are not understanding the album. This is one of Madonna's most interesting and exciting albums. Yes Madonna has transformed herself again, however this time she has really done it. She is reaching out for the youth and YOUTH buy the album, you will totally love it and understand it. Most Madonna fans at this point are mature and if you truly understand Madonna you know what she is doing. She is reflecting on her past and praising her present. The songs are innovative, and moving. A real Madonna fan should be reflecting on their past and praising the good parts of the present. Album highlights are of Hollywood, Love Profusion, Intervention, Nobody Knows Me, and the beautiful and romantically haunting Nothing Fails. On this album, Maonna is refreshed and like most of modern America, she is outspoken about the things she doesnt like and she is very expressive about being in love. The title track may have thrown everyone for a loop, but who ever thought Madonna would not try to surprise us. The song is enchanting, Madonnas vocals are as smooth as ever and the track makes you want to move. All the tracks on this album make you feel the urge to move, whether it be physically, mentally, and/or emotionally. If you ask me Madonna has not let her fans and America down, she has given us a look at life, love, dedication, history, and the promising future. Not to mention when you hear the love songs, you want to cry you feel so good, and when you hear the upbeat songs you just want to dance and you feel the justice behind her words. Madonna you've done it again, and hopefully new music listeners take a chance on this awesome album. Madonna haters beware...this gal is just as hot as she was 2 decades ago.
0345404475|4.0|This is the most depressing Sci-fi novel I have ever read, Perhaps I was expecting something else. It shows you how truly irrational life and experience can be. For me it reflects present day life and probably most life untill now, the imposibility of any REAL empathy between living things, the lack of coherence in most beings and the power of the &quot;current&quot; against change, the failed and innatural wirh that we have that life should stand still. It is a pessimistic work at least and I think it was intended to be depressing, so some people can actually understand what that means, or in the case of a lack of response to the book it is a sick joke about the &quot;flattening of affect&quot;. The work of course is designed to either produce a negative emotional response or to show the ovious sickness of any lack of it, and it succeeds admirably, sickening the gut of the most unflinching lunatic, for there is something very wrong in the lives of the characters as it indeed is a reflection of reality and the lack of &quot;empathy&quot; in it.
B00005JLRT|4.0|I'd been so disappointed in what had become of the Star Trek movie franchise and had heard so many bad things about _Nemesis_ that this is the only Star Trek movie that I didn't make it a point to go see in the theatre.  I actually hesitated to rent the DVD, but I figured I'd be bound to see it some time, better get it over with.  Well, I'm pleased to report that \\"A Generation's Final Journey\\" isn't actually all that bad.  It's not original by any means, but it doesn't make the gross mistakes of the rest of the TNG movies.<br />As Riker and Troi celebrate their wedding (finally!) and prepare to go off to Riker's new command on the Titan, Captain Picard receives a message that the Romulan Empire is making peace overtures to the Federation.  The Enterprise is the ship closest to Romulan Space (big surprise there), so Picard & Co. are sent to see what's the what.  Of course, all is not what it seems -- in more ways than one.<br />In a nutshell, _Nemesis_ reminded me of \\"Wrath of Khan\\" meets \\"Best of Both Worlds\\" with a little of \\"The Undiscovered Country\\" thrown in.  But if you're going to be derivative, you should definitely do your deriving from good material.  Certainly it helped the TNG franchise here.  The plot was understandable, without the excess elements that have cluttered the previous movies.  The characters were used well, without the former attempts to give everyone an important screen \\"moment\\" that was not necessarily in service of the plot.  There wasn't too much extraneous action, or attempts to make Picard into a Kirk-like action hero.  All in all, it viewed like a 2-part episode of the series.<br />The thing that _Nemesis_ lacks more than anything is chemistry.  The original series may not have been so artful or socially relevant, but it was often chock-full of emotional impact.  TNG was always a more cerebral show.  _Nemesis_ is true to that form, but that cerebral energy, I think, just doesn't translate well to the big screen.  I couldn't help but compare the big battle with the Kirk/Kahn stalk through the nebula in Start Trek II and find the current film lacking.  There's a meeting of minds here, but they're both very cold minds, lacking the passion of the original series' characters that made that show so great.<br />_Nemesis_ is certainly the best of the TNG movies.  It doesn't compare to any of the Nicholas Meyer works, however.  I'm glad I waited for the video release.ompare the big battle with the Kirk/Kahn stalk through the nebula in Start Trek II and find the current film lacking.

B00005RZV4|4.0|I'm picky.  Very picky.  I can't stand live albums, usually they're full of cheering and profanities spouted off from the crowd.  There's just something so different about hearing a concert to actually being there.  But when I saw NIN's live All That Could Have Been album for 5 bucks at a used record store, I couldn't help it, I took it home like a stray kitty I found on the street.  I didn't really have any high hopes for the album, so I settled down on the floor with my AP biology project and popped it in my stereo.  I was shocked.  My mouth dropped.  My ears rang.  Brilliant.  Closer, Starf******, March of the Pigs, Fragile, they're all brilliant on this cd.  They all have a different, more distinct sound as they're being presented live (I've never had the pleasure of seeing them live, I'm part of a separate generation).  And what I like is that the crowd sound has been muted down so you can hear the music better.  The only reason this cd got 4 stars instead of 5 was because it can't seem to stay in my cd player for very long.  To it's credit, I can listen to it's 70 minute length all the way through at least once (with a few song repeats) but then it's out again.  But this cd is brilliant, and a valuable addition to any industrialist's or angst-rock lover's collection.
B00005OM4N|5.0|All of these songs were catchy. I like Overprotected, Bombastic Love, and What Its Like To Be Me most. But over-all I liked most of the whole cd.
6304057709|5.0|Jane Austen's Sense and Sensibility comes to the screen in a visually stunning, beautifully acted film. Emma Thompson stars as Elinor Dashwood, the sensible older sister of Marianne (Kate Winslet), who is idealistic and passionate about life and love. Elinor falls in love with the handsome and wealthy Edward (Hugh Grant), who may be keeping a secret from her. Marianne is completely besotted with the dashing and mysterious Mr. Willoughby. She, however, is persued by a much older and very conservative nobleman, Col. Brandon (Alan Rickman), who has a painful past.<br />The film follows the sisters on the road to love and happiness, which is quite a bumpy road, due to the rigorous constraints of 18th century society and manners. In the end, of course, true love previals for both sisters, as we always knew it would.<br />The English countryside is photographed in its splendor and the period homes and costumes are a delight. Emma Thompson captivates as the long-suffering Elinor, and Alan Rickman steals the show as the pitiable Colonel. If you like romance and period films, you will enjoy Sense and Sensibility.
B000001FW9|5.0|I can't imagine that anyone would associate the overly complicated and mechanical music that Gentle Giant created with warmth, but this recording (along with \\"In a Glass House\\") would certainly make one more inclined to do so.  The first thing that I noticed about \\"Acquiring the Taste\\" is the heavy use of synthesizers (including moog and mellotron), which is much more abundant than that on \\"Octopus\\" for example.  In fact, the first track on the CD (\\"Pantagruel's Nativity\\") opens with a very soft, multi-part moog synthesizer line, with really nice mellotron parts laced throughout the rest of the piece.  The title track, \\"Acquiring the Taste\\" is of course THE synthesizer piece, which just showcases the moog.  The second aspect of this recording that gives it warmth are the arrangements themselves, which are simultaneously complex in the prog-rock sense yet more \\"rock\\" oriented than later recordings.  Although many fans may find this early effort too \\"simple\\", I actually prefer the music at this stage of their development, which is considerably less dense and complicated, to recordings like \\"Three Friends\\" or \\"Octopus\\".  All in all, \\"Acquiring the Taste\\" makes for a very enjoyable listening experience.  Highly recommended.
B000083E79|5.0|I purchased this cd after watching Cher's final concert on VH-1.  Lots of great tunes, including one of Cher's favorites, Heart of Stone.  I enjoyed reading the synopsis of her career in the cd booklet too.  This cd is essential for any Cher fan.
B000003CMD|4.0|It seems strange that the Allman Brothers' reputation has fallen off so much since the 1970's.  While many of their contemporaries are still pretty highly regarded (Steely Dan, Neil Young, and Elton John among many others), ABB is in danger of becoming little more than a bad joke about pot smokers.  Little enough has been written about \\"Brothers and Sisters\\" in this space that some younger readers might fail to realize that back in the day, this was a simply huge album, featuring not only the bona fide hit single \\"Ramblin' Man\\", but also one of the very finest instrumentals of the rock era, the effervescent \\"Jessica\\".<br />One reason for this is probably the rock fan's reluctance to accept country music, or even anything that hints at it.  In some instances this may be mere prejudice towards products of \\"southern\\" culture, but more often it's probably just a side-effect of radio formatting tactics that try to separate the two forms rather than emphasize their (not insubstantial) commonalities.  While not a real fan of country music myself, I see no reason to dislike any form of art out of sheer principle.  It seems obvious that the more we can learn to appreciate (i.e., enjoy), the happier our lives will be.<br />That said, there's no question that the last couple of decades have not been kind to ABB's musical reputation, and a long string of weak releases hasn't helped any.  That's a shame, because during their peak period, the Allmans created some fabulous music, including this excellent effort from 1973.  \\"Wasted Words\\" and \\"Ramblin' Man\\" open the album with solid songwriting entries from both Greg Allman and Dicky Betts.  While &quot;Wasted&quot; is not as strong a tune as some of Greg's earlier work, it still presents a heartfelt (or perhaps heartsick) personal statement.  Still a staple of classic rock radio, \\"Ramblin' Man\\" features the trademark dual guitar lines, a tight little guitar solo, and some simple-but-effective dobro-work at the end.  Greg Allman's commitment to the blues is represented by \\"Come And Go Blues\\", a funky progression with more personal introspection, and \\"Jelly Jelly\\" which is a much more traditional slow blues that will only appeal to the serious blues aficionado.  \\"Southbound\\" is a much-underrated southern rocker, and \\"Jessica\\" is Betts' finest instrumental ever, and while his \\"Pony Boy\\" may seem too precious for some, it does have a certain playful charm.<br />Of course the real power of ABB is not in the songs themselves, but in the power of the playing, particularly in long instrumental solos, a tendency that is pretty much held in check here, presumably to keep the tracks radio-friendly.  Rather than try to replace the irreplaceable guitar master Duane Allman, Chuck Leavell was brought in to play piano - a move that pays big dividends on this album.  Like Duane, Leavell is simply a genius of his instrument: jazzy, playful, and melodic all at once.  True, his music isn't as soulful as Duane's, but his solos possess that &quot;hold onto your hat&quot; quality that makes you want to hear them again and again until you know every note by heart.<br />The Allman Brothers' glory days are surely behind them now, but the musical legacy they've left behind is a truly impressive one that deserves to be preserved and honored forever.  While this album is not quite up to their very best work (&quot;Eat a Peach&quot; is distinctly better), there's beautiful music here for any who can open their minds to it.commitment to the blues is represented by \\"Come And Go Blues\\", a funky progression with more personal introspection, and \\"Jelly Jelly\\" which is a much more traditional slow blues that will only appeal to the serious blues aficionado.  \\"Southbound\\" is a much-underrated southern rocker, and \\"Jessica\\" is Betts' finest instrumental ever, and while his \\"Pony Boy\\" may seem too precious for some, it does have a certain playful charm.<br />Of course the real power of ABB is not in the songs themselves, but in the power of the playing, particularly in long instrumental solos, a tendency that is pretty much held in check here, presumably to keep the tracks radio-friendly.

One of my personal favorite songs is \\"Serenity\\". It's kind of like another \\"Voodoo\\". The mello beats and Sully just singin' with the flow. It's Great. They also have songs like \\"Releasing the Demons\\" that speaks for itself. The main purpose I'm writing this is just to show what a kick *** cd this is. So buy it! All I can say is just wow........
B00003CX8U|4.0|Bob Fosse is a name that, in the minds of Broadway enthusiasts, is paralleled with images of breathtaking and original choreography. Those who have seen live versions of Cabaret, Chicago and Sweet Charity will know what a major talent he was in the Broadway world. In 1979 he directed and co-wrote All That Jazz - a 'fictitious' autobiographical account of his work and life.<br />Whilst a little long and some over indulgence occurs, All That Jazz is a remarkably original movie. It is not only a fascinating insight into the mind and life of a brilliant and talented man, but a captured record of the 1970's Broadway scene.<br />What is so remarkable about All The Jazz is that we actually enter into Fosses' mind to explore his thoughts, feelings and emotions. Two vehicles are used to achieve this - conversations with death (in the form of a white laced Jessica Lange) and stunning Broadway musical sequences. We explore his feelings on women, death and his art.<br />Roy Scheider brings a considerable amount of charisma and emotion to the role of Joe Gideon (who is based on Fosse). Another standout is Anne Reinking - ex lover of Fosse and seasoned Broadway performer. It would have been nice to see her film career take off so we could have seen more of her work. All the cast perform brilliantly in their roles, and a few surprises pop up with some early performances of some now well known actors.<br />All That Jazz contains wonderful performances, brilliant music and a story that not only captures the essence of a significant man in the history of Broadway, but also the vibrancy and originality of Broadway in the 70's. Watch this movie and go back in time to a wonderful world during a colourful era.
B000001FFR|5.0|Combine the thrash guitars of Scott Ian and Dan Spitz and bass of Frank Bello, the breakneck drums of Charlie Benante, the melodic wail of Joey Belladonna, combine metal with punk influence, and there you have it: the foundation for Anthrax's \\"Spreading The Disease\\", one excellent album. From \\"A.I.R.\\" to \\"Gung-Ho\\", this album is fast, loud, and obnoxious as they wanna be. Yeah, the production isn't that great (this album IS from '85), but the songs more than make up for it. This was the LP that proved that Anthrax could seriously compete against Metallica and Megadeth in the thrash olympics. Recommended.
0385504209|1.0|I picked up this book because it came highly recommended by several people who know that I have done quite a bit of studying on the esoteric.  I am now looking these  friends and wondering what they really think good literature is?  This book could not be more poorly written if it tried.  Not a single character is even remotely unpredictable..I can tell you that I can virtually mouth the words that they are going to say at least 3 paragraphs before I read them.  The only saving grace is that some of the art and science is sortof interesting.  However, I keep putting down the book in order to check my library for the truth of some the claims that are made.  A whole bunch have no factual basis.  Why wouldn't people just read the real stories of DaVinci and the Knights Templar?  The truth is so much more interesting than this book.<br />For those folks who are in uproar about the religion part of this book, get over it.  There are some really good books that make more valid, well researched and damaging claims.<br />If I was sitting on a beach drinking something tropical on a balmy summer day and I didn't want to think at all, maybe I would like this book but I think not.<br />For a much better written book that also contains a lot of estoric information and weaves a better and more haunting tale, try &quot;The Angle Quickest for Flight&quot; by Steven Kotler.

I love the first JJ album, but this one is really really bad! he really did not put any effort to make this second album, he basically repeated the same riffs over and over!

B00005U8EM|5.0|When I first saw this movie in the early 90's, I liked it. However, I didn't think that much of it; until I realized later that it stayed with me in a way unusual for most broad comedies.<BR>The plot is simple: a Pittsburgh weatherman reports on the appearance of \\"Punxstaney Phil\\" on Groundhog Day and gets stuck in the day. Really stuck-as in he keeps living the day over and over again. He wakes up to the same bad music (Sonny and Cher), runs into the same annoying high school friend, meets up with his perky, lovely producer and cynical cameraman (Andie MacDowell and Chris Elliot), and sees the groundhog come out again and again. For the others, the day is new and fresh each time. For our hero, it is same old, same old. Eventually, he begins to realize he can \\"work\\" with the situation (e.g., freak people out by knowing what will happen, do outrageous things with no consequence).<BR>Bill Murray's deadpan, slightly improvisational style works beautifully in this role. Andie MacDowell isn't asked to do much more than be sweet and beautiful-and that's not too hard for her. <BR>The DVD added so much to my appreciation of the movie. The director Harold Ramis has a most insightful track over the film. I was very interested to learn that the movie had Zen overtones (one man lives 10,000 days) as well as modeling its structure on the five stages of grief. Whoa. <BR>I would recommend this movie to individuals who enjoy the big, broad comedies from the 80's and 90's (e.g., Ghostbusters, Stripes). I wouldn't recommend this movie to individuals who don't like Bill Murray-as this is the quintessential Murray film.
B00008S2VG|1.0|I own every Madonna CD and have been a fan since Holiday. This CD is stunningly bad. Her rapping is simply embarassing--I cringe through half this CD. And not that M. ever had a formidable voice, but American Life makes you realize just how thin and unimpressive her pipes really are. <br />I didn't love Die Another Day when it came out with the stinky Bond film of the same title, but it's by far the best song on this CD. Give up the poet laureate act, Midge, and go back to what you do best--fun dance candy. Leave the agonizing and the depth to others. <br />The musical equivalent of Swept Away. Ick.
6301966562|5.0|I fell in love with this movie when I was a 14 year old kid. I have been waiting forever to see it again.  I wish it would come out on DVD.  My favorite scene is where the computer listens to the Pepsi commercial and then make a song from it. When-o-when will this come to DVD?<br />Neil
B00005J6UP|4.0|this is one of my favorite films ever.a group of teenagers find an old pirates treasure map in an attic . since they are about to be evicted from their homes ,they decide to embark on a journey to recover the lost gems in order to pay off wealthy land developers.there are lots of twists and turns as they explore through caves and tunnels.good acting all around , well directed and one of steven spielbergs greatest story's. the DVD has plenty of nice extras especially the Cyndi Lauper music video which is well directed and runs a whopping 12 minutes !
B00005JLO2|4.0|Having no expectations when watching Shekhar Kapur's &quot;Four Feathers,&quot; I found this earnest film to be a genuine surprise. Costume epics of this type have not been en vogue since the &quot;Lawrence of Arabia&quot; days of David Lean. That's too bad, because during the far-too-brief 130-minute running time, I was captivated, enthralled and eventually frustrated.<br />This majestic story, based on the 1902 A.E.W. Mason novel, deserves at least a three-hour running time. My guess is that much of the footage was left on the cutting room floor so that our ever inpatient youth wouldn't squirm too much. The pace of this film is jumpy, and the story difficult to follow at times. The transition from England to the Sudan happens far too quickly, with the early character-establishing scenes feeling rushed.<br />Heath Ledger is excellent in the lead role of a 19th century British soldier who resigns on the eve of war. His fiancee (Kate Hudson) and three of his best friends give him four white feathers, a symbolic gesture of cowardice, and he's even disowned by his father. Needless-to-say, Heath is having a very bad day. Rather than accept his fate, he travels to the Sudan on the heels of his soldier friends to prove his mettle, posing at different times as a slave, a spy and a native.<br />Djimon Hounsou eventually enters the film as a philosophical native who befriends Ledger, serving as his Sudan guardian angel. I have always appreciated Hounsou's unique presence in films (&quot;Gladiator&quot;), and he continues his string of excellent character work with &quot;Four Feathers.&quot;<br />Of course, there's a great battle, and Heath finds himself on the opposite side of the British Army. Amdist the smoke, fire and bullets, he's eventually trying to save his friends while furiously fighting off the Sudan natives. Throw into this potent mix his interesting relationship with his best friend, wonderfully played by Wes Bentley, who's in love with his fiancee.<br />The stuff of misty romance and glorious British sensibility, &quot;Four Feathers&quot; plays like a sweeping novel. For the most part, the intricate storylines play out with great satisfaction. But the jump to the Sudan happens far too quickly, and we are left asking why Mr. Ledger resigned from the British army in the first place. It's telling that as a viewer, when this film ended, I wanted more. The performances are uniformly superb, the period detail exceptional and the attitude earnest. But this deserving tale needed to be fleshed out. A 19th-century epic cannot be told with 21st-century pace. <br />&quot;Four Feathers&quot; deserves at least three hours. As is, the journey is more than worthwhile.
B000002LQR|5.0|There's simply no other word for it. And 'cool' is not a word I like to use very often, but it's the only possible adjective that could ever describe this wonderful piece of music. 'Blood Sugar Sex Magik' shows the Red Hot Chili Peppers at their very best, both in terms of commercial appeal and of artistic merit (although 'One Hot Minute' is argubly more sophisticated - but at times it can get almost inaudible). The Peppers' unique blend of funk, rap and hard rock is at its most coherent on this album, and while some might say they gave in to commercial pressure to make straight, mainstream rock ballads like 'I Could Have Lied' and the mega-hit 'Under The Bridge', those were very smartly balanced with cocky funk-metal pieces that go back to the band's roots.<br />If 'Mother's Milk' left doubts in anybody's mind whether the band's new drummer and guitarist would be suitable replacements for the founding members Jack Irons and Hillel Slovak, 'Blood Sugar Sex Magik' - the second release by the band's final line-up - killed them off, with a vengence. Instrumentally, the Peppers are at their best here (once again, 'One Hot Minute' is a close second and is also worth checking out). The very young John Frusciante is now a full-time member of the band and he puts his skillful, funky guitar to fantastic use, and Chad Smith gives a great beat (hear his great drumming on the title track). Other than that, master bassist Flea sounds better than ever, as does Anthony Kiedis's beautiful voice.<br />The songs are more varied than on any other RHCP album, and since there are no less than 17 of them I won't go through all of them, but I'll mention some remarkable ones worthy of notice. 'The Power Of Equality' is a fantastic, highly energetic funk/rap/rock bit with a spectacular bass and great guitar work, and makes for a great opening. 'If You Have To Ask' - with great backing vocals - 'Funky Monks', 'Naked In The Rain', 'Melloship Slinkey', 'The Righteous And The Wicked' and the hit 'Give It Away' are all great songs along similiar lines. John's guitar on 'Funky Monks' is really amazing. 'Sir Psycho Sexy' takes the rap-metal direction to its extremes with an epic 8+ minute poem with a cool beat and very explicit lyrics.<br />On the metal front we have the very cool 'Suck My Kiss' and the great, epic title track that has great vocals and great instrumental work from all members. There are also some great melodic pieces - 'Breaking The Girl', 'I Could Have Lied', and of course 'Under The Bridge'. Finally, as a little joke to finish the CD - in the fine tradition of the Beatles' 'Her Majesty' - we have a sped-up cover of Robert Johnson's classic 'They're Red Hot' - a song whose relevance is obvious, and its inclusion is a stroke of genius.<br />'Blood Sugar Sex Magik' is really an album everyone can enjoy. My grunge-friends like it, my jazz-friends like it, my rap-friends like it, even my classical-friends enjoyed it. It's just - say it again - so COOL. To hear this properly you need to have good speakers and a good stereo and the bass turned ALL THE WAY UP. You won't regret it.
B00008S2VG|1.0|I am a big Madonna fan, and bought the new album before hearing all the tracks.  Boy, was I disappointed.  This has got to be the worst album she's ever done.  She comes off as being preachy in songs like &quot;American Life&quot;.  There also seems to be no soul or feeling in any of the tracks.  It seems the days of Like a Prayer (which I consider to be her best) are no more.  If this is what the future holds for Madonna's music, then count me out.  I'll be happy listening to her good albums like Music, Ray of Light, and Like a Prayer.  In her attempt to capture the younger audience of today, she has abandoned the audience that made her popular in the first place.  Don't waste your money or your time on this CD.  I sure wish I hadn't
B00005JLRT|2.0|For the general movie fan: this film was made to be edgy, but just comes across as dark and cold; buy &quot;First Contact&quot; instead for great Sci-Fi.  For Trek fans specifically: the DVD is primarily a cult-of-personality collage on the director and Tom Hardy, neither of whom know or care much about Star Trek.
0871137380|5.0|As an ex ranger, I strongly take exception to the review of March 23, 2003 from Australia. Mark's book, \\"Black Hawk Down\\", tells the reader perfectly clearly what we do as Rangers. And, as to why we do what we do in the military? Mark says it in \\"Black Hawk Down\\", and, as the reviewer from Virginia in the review dated Feb 16, 2003 says, Norm Remick's book, \\"West Point: Character Leadership..\\" further explains the roots of the deep, philosophical feelings of duty (to the guy next to you, and, to the family back home), honor, and patriotism that are pervasive throughout the US military, including the Special Ops, like Rangers. That's what makes our military the best in the world. <br />Also recommended: Remick's \\"West Point: Character Leadership..\\", and, Robin Moore's \\"The Hunt For Bin Laden\\".
B00000JGOJ|5.0|I have raved about this amazingly well-crafted film to everyone I know. I've watched it over and over and the dynamics never cease to amaze me, and small details pop up that I hadn't noticed before.
B00005JLRT|3.0|\\"Nemesis\\" is heavy on action, light on plot, almost the exact opposite of \\"First Contact\\" which is my favorite Star Trek movie. However, this is a watchable film, and the movie certainly highlights the fact that by now the TNG characters all have wonderful chemistry with one another, and some of the characters' acting skills have greatly improved since the inception of the series. Patrick Stewart (whose acting skills have always been excellent in my opinion) turns in a bravo performance, as does Brent Spiner. The \\"dune buggy\\" scenes in the desert are lots of fun. However, how does this segment of the film square with the \\"Prime Directive?\\" I suppose we are destined never to know, but that's Hollywood. This is a minor quibble.<br /><br />My main criticism of the movie is that I found the plot to be murky and the evil protagonist somewhat unfocused as regards his motivations and purpose. I also don't like the idea of \\"good Romulans\\" (spoiler omitted here). The best thing about the film is that it deals with the Romulans/Remans who I have always thought are the best \\"Star Trek\\" villains with the possible exception of the Borg.<br /><br />If you are a Star Trek fan, you will like this movie. Those who are not will likely be less enthusiastic. RJB.
B00008DDXC|3.0|The Harry Potter franchise is so popular and such a box office powerhouse that critics must refuse to lambast it for fear of losing their license. If The Chamber of Secrets had been released as a movie before the books were ever written (indulge in my fantasy), it would not have received such glowing reviews.<br />It is a dark, dull adventure too scarey for very young veiwers and too silly for adults. It is a preteen fantasy film, but that's all it is. Yes, it has great effects if you don't mind the type of CGI cartoon realism we now must endure thanks to Episodes 1-3, but there's nothing magical about the journey this film takes you on. It compares poorly to films like Willy Wonka, Wizard of Oz, The Lord of the Rings, and even the Goonies for that matter in it's utter lack of joy - tacking on a corny ending complete with wide grins and a standing ovation doesn't count (think Episode 6). All of the above mentioned movies, and there are many more, were capable of mixing whimsey with scarey moments and packaging the adventure in such a way that you feel you've just been on a dangerous but magical adventure.<br />My suggestion for the next installment. First, get a new, younger Harry Potter. Doctor Who did it, you can too. Second, ask the editors to cut the extended denoument = here's a thought: end on a dramatic moment, we can fill in the after-gaps ourselves. Third, hire someone who understands humor - your attempts at humor/light moments miss the mark (she accidently temorarily turns herself into a cat - HILARIOUS! not). Fourth, what a lame sport - i'm sure it translates better in the book. Fifth, eliminate any cgi character that inverts its sentences or talks about itself using it's own name. Sixth, give the director/writers enough backbone NOT to be so faithful to the book. Lord of the Rings this is not. Seventh, enough with the \\"breaking the rules\\" schtick, we get it. Eigth, surely there are some adults in the story who can save the day every once in a while. Ninth, think 2 hours or less. Tenth, do whatever you want and laugh all the way to the bank.<br />In the future, when all the hoopla is over, history will not judge these movies favorably.
B000088E6D|4.0|While in New York recently, a helpful salesperson at Colny Records recormended this recording and he was right on the mark.  Michael Buble has Sinatra's flair, William's good looks and Harry Connick Jr's showmanship.  It is not often that I praise male vocalists, personally I like the female torch/cabaret singers like Linda Eder, Karen Akers, Connie Champagne and Sharon McNight but Buble's CD is hauntingly beautiful and a must have for your listening pleasure.  And get it here on AMAZON.com, I paid $$ more for it at Colony but hey, its Colony Music and it is New Yor City...plus, I never would have gotten the recommendation.  ENJOY!
B00006F7S4|5.0|Only Beck could, in recording and cataloguing his own heartache, make an album so beautiful and versatile that it speaks to any listener, heartbroken or otherwise.  His melancholy is so perfectly expressed by his sparse lyrics and soft, clean melodies that it transcends the conventions of breakup music -- these songs are not bitter, not self-pitying.  Nor are they depressing, despite the slow, swirling undercurrent of sadness that runs through them all.  They are, if anything, a quiet, beautifully worded celebration of heartbreak.
B00003CXTG|2.0|Disney's executives claimed (before this movie came out) that it was a sure blockbuster.  They were disappointed, but not nearly as disappointed as were those of us who paid to see this turkey.  It is not often that a movie made in this cynical day and age is sappy and corny, but this one is.  This is a movie that takes itself far too seriously, and it contains every overused cliche' in its pointless love triangle story.  This could have been a pretty good movie if it had just stuck to its theme--the period immediately before Pearl Harbor through the Doolittle Raid.  This was a pivoltal time in the life of America, and there is a great story waiting to be told.  This movie fails to tell it, and instead disappoints the viewer.<br />I have tried three times to watch the DVD all the way through (I won't write a review unless I've done that).  Finally made it one rainy afternoon but it was a cheerless task--a tiresome chore.  Excepting the excellent combat scenes, this movie is essentially a caricature of a good war movie with a pointless love theme that fatally distracts from the real theme of the movie while failing to hold the viewer's interest.<br />I rate this movie not even good enough to buy the DVD.
B000001FS3|5.0|There is no band anywhere who could make an album this good. No doubt it is the greatest album EVER! If you don't own this album you don't know great music.
B00005JLR2|3.0|Disney bastardized its earlier classic \\"Flubber\\" with the pathetic remake, so, I suppose the company tried to do the same with this updated reworking of the Stevenson classic that the studio had so superbly adapted in the 1950's. \\"Treasure Planet\\", while boasting some magnificent animation, doesn't hold the interest of those beyond the age of 10. It's almost like watching an offshoot of \\"Titan, A.E\\", taking place in a parallel timeline.<br />Great casting of the actors providing the voices is the film's only saving grace. Joseph Gordon-Levitt, Brian Murray, Emma Thompson, the great Patrick McGoohan, the distinctive Roscoe Lee Browne, and the always-dependable Tony Jay as \\"the narrator\\" bring life to routine storytelling.
B000084T18|5.0|Look, I'm not the biggest rap fan out there, there was a long period when I couldn't stand it for even a couple minutes. But I have to say that Fifty is a great rapper. The other reviews accuse him of being \\"repeatitive\\" even though he probably has the most clever raps out there right now. <br />The thing about it, is that rap is rap, it is about money, women, guns, drugs, etc..<br />Just like rock and roll (modern, anyway) is angsty and bitchy. <br />If you like rap, you'll love fifty, if you don't then don't review his CD.
B000062TU1|3.0|Although one of the greatest movie adaptions ever filmed, this film is a little non-professional. Great visual effects, impressive debut from Radcliffe and intense action scenes complement this film adaptation from one of the most popular book series of all time. Despite all this however, the film also contains an absolutely terrible, worthless, in the gutter performance from Rupert Grint as Ron ( you'd think they'd be a bit more selective with the kids ) and a rather impressive but obnoxious performance from Hermione(Emma Watson). It also seemed that the filmmakers didnt know what to do with the visual effects (flying, wizardry) and were just trying to figure out where all of them went. The most significant factors from this film however are Richard Harris and Maggie Smith, the 2 most charming actors I have ever seen in a childrens flick.
0316666343|4.0|This book hooked me instantly with its opening scene.  And then what was different was that even after Susie was murdered, she is still our protagonist.  The point of view in The Lovely Bones is unique; how often do we read from the dead's eyes?<br />And then we see what happens to a family after the disappearance and murder of one of its members thru Susie.  We follow them for years, watching their broken lives along with Susie.  And we also watch two other people who touched her life, Ray and Ruth, two classmates.<br />By the end, we know Susie has become to accept she is unable to infuse herself into her families physical lives as well as broaden herself in heaven.  And her family moves on, however broken just the same.
B00003CXXM|1.0|This movie was one of the worst movies I have ever seen. I was exspecting what they said in the comercials. I thought that this was going to be a non stop action, edge of your seat movie. That was way off the mark. Many of the action scenes were so boring I had to fight off sleep, which on secound thought would have been a relief so I would not have to suffer through any more of this movie.<BR> If you read the book you will hate this movie more than the people that did not. This was the worst movie adaptation of a book since The Firm. Carlos is not in it, instead the good guy from the book Conklin is the big bad guy.<BR> So once again don't waste your time with this. You want to see a good movie in this genre, see Mission Imposible or James Bond or an even less well known movie the Advengers.
B000002KHB|5.0|With this album Deep Purple became, if they haven't before with 'In Rock' and 'Fireball', one of the ultimate and classic rock acts. 'Machine Head' is their most selling record, containing their most well-known and anthemic song 'Smoke on the water'. But it isn'n just 'Smoke' that holds water here, offcourse.<BR>This album is their most influential, along with 'In Rock' and 'Made in Japan'. Maybe does not have that heavy edge of those two records, it is of sound a little bit polished, but Purple here didn't lost any of their heavy sound here. In fact, this sounds so 'classic' and recognizable, that may be the number one DP album to get. They continued to develop here, and influences like classsical, blues, and even jazz are melted superb here, with so recognizable, huge sound of Ian Lord organ and Ritichie Blackmore virtuoso guitar. <BR>Every song stand by itself like a classic. 'Highway star' with its pumping intro and screaming vocals is great way to start this classic album, and guitar solos (twin guitars) are must-learn for any serious guitarist. And are such a joy to play! 'Lazy' is my favorite album track, maybe even favourite DP song. From great prog-rock intro, it develops in fast blues with jazzy feeling, and it becames hard rock as Ian Gillan delivers some of his trademark vocals in the climax of the song. Just fantastic groove, as whole album is. 'Space trucking' is fantastic hard-rocker closing the album, and it was a stellar performance in concert.<BR>And how hany guitarists started with that eternal riff from 'Smoke on the water'...?
B00006IUL7|4.0|Insomnia is a very enjoyable, gripping psychological thriller that is brilliant to the plot, but dead to the performances, except for Pacino. Williams however is a little slack in his supposed &quot;killer&quot; role, but he is definitely no killer. His calmness works out for his role whenver hes in public, but with Pacino, you'd figure he'd be a bit more threatening. Swank is pretty good, however unnecessary, filmmakers needed someone bigger, but she is still a worthy character. Directing is awesome, however nothing like Memento. Leaves the viewer with an eerie, but unnoticeable sense of sleepiness, almost putting him or her in the situation. Fine, disorienting plot, and as usual, Pacino is at his best.
B000000OQF|1.0|Don't get me wrong. I mean, the lyrics are great and all but Axl's voice is just brutal. I could probably sing better than him. If u want good music then listen to Oasis!
B00005AR3G|5.0|Reminds me of why I watch chartoons, the movie is by far one of the funniest movies ever.  It's not stupid funny either, it actually has a crazy plot that the story revolves around.  I really don't want to spoil the movie, it makes it so much better if you see it for the first time not knowing anything about it.  I will just give you a run down that this movie has no faults, it's well scripted, well voiced and well drawin.  There's nothing wrong with the movie, I would buy it twice but then that would be useless... Okay... but I like it a lot and I highly recomend it.

B000089RVX|5.0|after hearing \\"bring me to life\\", i was curious about the cd. when i finally heard a copy, i knew i had to add this to my cd's. this is by far one of my fav. although the guitar sound isn't anything new (it kicks butt all the same), the vocals are what really attracted me. Amy's voice has a very haunting quality to it that stays in your head for weeks. her voice is the highlight of the album. i haven't heard anyone sing like her in a very long time. Evanescence is an interesting and very welcome addition to the rock scene and im sure that they will be very big in days to come.
0141301104|5.0|I read this years ago, but I find it far more superior to Harry Potter and the like. This book by the author of Charlie and the Chocolate Factory is an amusing parody of witches and the myth. Imagine witches who hate children so much they will stop at nothing to destroy them. Perhaps a little dark for younger readers, this was fun. The witches cleverly disguise themselves as nice ladies and try and lure their victims with candy and the like. The only way to tell them apart is through their bald heads covered by wigs that leave nasty, itchy rashes. They have no toes and stuff their square shaped feet into pointy shoes and their teeth! Luckily a grandmother and her grandson are not content to stay at home and watch as the witches attempt to poison the world's child population. Mayhem and danger lurk around every corner in this entertaining romp and I think it a must for every child's library.
6305165912|5.0|The Big Lebowski is without a doubt my favorite film. Why? Because unlike 99% of all comedies, it makes me laugh just as much every single time I watch it. In fact, it only gets better and better the more I watch it! The Coen Brothers are the best filmmakers out there right now, and The Big Lebowski is their most underrated little gem. Overlooked and misunderstood when it was initially released back in 1998, do make sure you check it out if you are one of those who never got around to seeing it back then - you won't be sorry you did.<br />The DVD itself might not be the greatest out there in terms of bonus material, but considering the Coen brothers have never been big on bonus materials it could've been a lot worse as the DVD comes with a nice 30 minute interview with the Coen brothers themselves as well as main cast members. The DVD also includes a teaser trailer as well as cast and filmmaker biographies. The video quality is superb. Clean, sharp and free of any print flaws, specks, etc. it is a terrific video transfer. The sound is equally terrific (for this type of film). It might not be a reference quality disc you'd take out to impress friends with, but it gets the job done very nicely.<br />Highly recommended!
B00008G9JO|1.0|I remember when this was originally released, and I remember how fast it went to the bargain bin with the other cutouts at the local record store. I remember because I BOUGHT it from the bargain bin (I'd been burned before with \\"War Child\\", and I'd heard the obnoxious single \\"Too Old to Rock and Roll, Too Young to Die\\", so I wasn't taking chances). And even though I only paid a buck or two for my copy, I still regretted the purchase. Nowadays the only song on it I ever, ever play is \\"Moths\\".<br />Enough about me, however. It's worth noting, that although Jethro Tull had been in artistic, critical, and popular decline since just after \\"A Passion Play\\", this album, \\"Heavy Horses\\", is the album that knocked it permanently off the top ten. Something to think about.
0374172897|5.0|Quite simply, The Hours is a masterpiece. It carefully, slowly, weaves together the stories of three women in three times. There's Virginia Woolf, who, in 1920-something, is beginning to form the plot of and write Mrs Dalloway. In the early 1950's we meet Laura Brown, a pregnant housewife who doesn't understand why she's suffocating in her sunny Los Angeles home. And then, in 2002 or so, Clarissa Vaughan realises that she's based most of her life on something that might not always be there: a poet who's been afflicted with AIDS for years. The book leads you through one day in the life of these women (an homage to Mrs Dalloway taking place in a single day). The beginning entranced me, with its beautiful, yet subtle, graceful writing and the unusual starkness of the characters. Indeed, they don't seem like characters at all, but people you've known casually for many years, and you've just discovered that their lives aren't at all what they appear. There are several encounters with minor characters which should clutter the streamlined storytelling, but instead seem to complete the entire figure of the main characters and wrap the book into a whole. The book is wordy and very thoughtful, but every phrase feels necessary to contribute to the full view of the story. And by the end of the novel, the lives of the women have become meaningful, honest, and utterly real. It's a haunting journey through events that become all too familiar.
B00006RU5B|2.0|This fusion of Soundgarden and Rage Against The Machine is much more of a win for Soundgarden fans than Rage fans.  You will not find any of the hip-hop influences or rich grooves often found on a Rage CD.  That said, this is not that great of a CD.  It is almost painful to listen to it from start to finish.  The first 5 tracks are tolerable with the best tracks as bookends.  &quot;Cochise&quot; starts the CD off strong, but sadly the CD cannot maintain the momentum.  The opener is followed by 3 run-of-the-mill tracks that can be listened to, but quickly forgotten.  The legacy of this band will certainly be &quot;Like A Stone&quot;.  This track is worth the price of admission.  Chris Cornell works the catchy lyrics much like he did on &quot;Blackhole Sun&quot;.<br />If you buy the CD, you will probably find yourself listening to &quot;Cochise&quot;, skipping to &quot;Like A Stone&quot;, and repeating.  The other tracks are either uninteresting or plain aweful.

0684857219|5.0|I am amused at some of the reviews of this great book by arguably the greatest bodybuilder of all time - Anold Schwarzenneggar.Those of us who were around a couple decades ago show the great evolution of Arnold's physique. Arnold transformed himself from a very beefy and unsymetrical better than average Mr. Universe competitor to a six time Mr. Universe and 7 time Mr. Olympia and probably the greatest of all time.This training system will not lead to overtraining. That said, Arnold does not recommend that you start off with 20 sets per bodypart and train six days per week.Remember too that Arnold recommends supplements and large amountS of protein. At his peak, Arnold was ingesting 150 dessicated liver tablets, 3 dozen eggs and 3-5 lbs of beef PER DAY!Fans of the Mentzer system will not like Arnolds techniques, but Arnolds system will generate better overall results.To the individual that suggested doing front deltoid raises with thumbs up rather than palms down as Arnold suggests, obviously you are new to training. It may be safer, but it doesn't work the deltoids as well. Why not just stick to inclines?I highly recommend this book to anyone who wants to achieve their best in physical development.
0790742780|5.0|This is a powerful film, but I personally don't look at it as some type of social commentary or condemnation of modern society, although it certainly touches on some of the problems that will always exist among human beings.  Falling Down may well have a potent effect on anyone watching it, though.  It always leaves me feeling really, really weird because it touches on so many things we all have to put up with each day, presents a monster whom I can't help but sympathize with in some degree, provides us with a hero whose own life is rife with undeserved problems, and runs its course atop a strong undercurrent of sadness.  Michael Douglas gives one of his better performances as Bill Foster, an unremarkable man who finds his world torn apart and finally just snaps.  He has lost his wife and little girl (which is his own fault); he's lost his job, the one thing that made him feel important; he just wants things to be like they used to be.  He doesn't want to sit in traffic with no air conditioning or pay almost a dollar for a little can of soda or see plastic surgeons living the life of Riley while he can't even support his little girl.  His journey \\"home\\" is an extraordinary one, and the kinds of awful people he encounters on the way do nothing to help his mentality.  It's hard not to cheer him on when he manages to effect an escape from a couple of gangsters trying to rob him, but acts such as holding a burger joint up just because they refuse to serve him breakfast after lunch time is, obviously, way out there.  No matter what terrible things he does, though, I can't get completely past the fact that he earnestly wants to see his little girl and give her a present for her birthday; in a clearly psychotic way, I find this movie somewhat touching, and that only makes the whole experience more depressing than it already is.<br />Robert Duvall is indeed quite good as the good cop, Prendergast, pursuing this vigilante on his last day before retirement.  His life is no dream either, but of course he handles his own problems in a way quite unlike our man Foster does.  His wife is clearly disturbed, made frighteningly burdensome and vulnerable by the death of their own little girl and an earlier wounding of her husband on the job.  For her benefit, he took a desk job and is forced to put up with a lot of jokes and insults from his fellow cops, including his own boss.  Except for his partner, all of the cops in this film are as unfeeling and cruel as some of the shady characters Foster meets up with during his journey home, and that is to me one of the more disturbing aspects of this film.<br />One of the things I liked most about Falling Down was its attempt to portray Foster as one very disturbed man and not a stand-in for any type of stereotypical vigilante; one character in particular makes this point quite clearly when, discovering that Foster doesn't actually agree with him in his own twisted, stereotypically extremist mindset, he asks the man just what kind of vigilante he is supposed to be.  My own thinking is that Falling Down is not meant to be a warning about a group of potential Bill Fosters festering in the midst of society; instead, by showing us what happens to one man, it is warning us to walk carefully on our own journeys and to be careful to keep our tempers in check even when the world seems to be out to get us.  At the same time, it doesn't imply that we should roll over and play dead whenever a problem comes our way, using the character of Prendergast to show us that we can and should stand up for ourselves but only in constructive ways.  I really have a lot of conflicting emotions about this film, but the one thing I am sure of is that Falling Down is an unforgettable motion picture well worth seeing.eam either, but of course he handles his own problems in a way quite unlike our man Foster does.

0446677450|5.0|This book is definitely not for Harvard graduates. Typical Harvard graduates are too busy updating their resumes and pounding the pavement trying to find a j-o-b just like the one they just got downsized from to benefit from a book like this.On the other hand, for people who are willing to be changed; are sick and tired of the rat race; tired of paying for somebodyelse's dreams; tired of having their boss determine how many sick days they deserve or how many vacation days they can take will enjoy and benefit from this book.  I also recommend Loopholes of the Rich and The Business School for People who like helping people.Slams at network marketing people by 1 star reviewers are predictable and stale.  Question 1 stars: How is your lifestyle? What kind of car do you drive? Where do you go to vacation? How much did you pay in taxes last year?The investment advice is also right on. Just talk to all of the people who are losing money following conventionable advice.A house is an asset? Yes, if you are the bank. If you want to turn a house into an asset, it's very simple, do what banks do and become a real estate investor.As for that website that keeps getting mentioned here, if it really was that good there would be no need to repeatedly mention it here would there?RDPD is a OUTSTANDING book.  I highly recommend it.My motto is: I'll do today what others won't so I can do tommorrow what others can't.The recipe is simple; just follow Kiyosaki's advice.
0380729407|3.0|I know that Something Wicked This Way Comes is a classic that many readers love, but I found the novel rather disappointing and can in all honesty only reward it with three stars.  For me, the writing was just too disjointed at times, full of little pot holes I kept catching my foot in.  The real world of this dark fantasy, the town before the dark carnival rolled in under the cover of night, never seemed real to me, and the friendship of the two boys, Will and Jim, never made perfect sense.  We are told they are so much alike, born two minutes apart, but they seem mirror opposites to me.  One aspect of Jim in particular is mentioned rather prominently yet never explored or even mentioned again, a fact I found disheartening.  Then there is Will's father, an older man stumbling quietly through just a few pages of the first half of the novel before becoming magically transformed into an eloquent speaker and incredibly able enemy of dark forces.  Certainly, there are aspects of the story I accepted and enjoyed, such as the issue of time and the ways in which boys want to be older and aging men and women long for a return to youth; it was exactly these most innermost desires that fed the strange carnival operators Mr. Dark and Mr. Cooger.  The idea of the carnival freaks being the remnants of the carnival's former victims is also good.  The machinery of the story, though, just never worked for me.  The mirror magic of the maze was not developed enough to be convincing, and the inner mysteries of the darkly magical carousel never seemed anything more than foolish to me.  Since the evils of the carnival were never convincing to me, the manner in which its harmful effects are fought seemed almost ridiculous.  My entire reading of this novel was something of a struggle, one which offered me only a few moments of satisfaction.  Knowing that this is Ray Bradbury, I tried very hard to like Something Wicked This Way Comes, but for whatever reason Bradbury's magic just never had any discernible effect on me.any discernible effect on me.
6302548195|5.0|I first saw Pumping Iron during it's original theatre release back in 1977.Recently browsing on TV, I came across this movie on Cinemax.Yes, it's easy to see why Arnold became the great star that he is today. Contrary to the opinion of others who have posted here, this was not Arnold's first movie. He made Hercules in New York in 1970 and co starred with Sally Fields and Jeff Bridges in &quot;Stay Hungry&quot; also made in 1975.I wonder how many people are aware that Arnold had to drop his weight down to 210 lbs to satisfy the directors of Stay Hungry and then beef up to 235 lbs in under 3 months for the 1975 Mr. Olympia and Pumping Iron?Pumping Iron is about the heart and soul of bodybuilding. It captures the passion, drive and innocence of the then unknown sub culture called bodybuilding.My only complaint is that the directors; Gaines and Butler did not go more into the history of bodybuilding and cover more of the sport. Bodybuilding was then much more than 1 or 2 personalities, the IFBB Mr. Universe and Mr. Olympia. In any event, I believe that Pumping Iron did much to gain popularity for bodybuilding and even now, 25 years later is still a good movie to watch.Gaines &amp; Butler, how about a sequel?
B0000025OP|5.0|I originally bought this album in vinyl and haven't had a record player in many years.  Recently purchased it in CD.  I had forgotten how good the songs are on this album.  And, like all Dylan songs, they are timeless.  They are as relevant today as the day he wrote them.<br />Most Dylan albums are well worth the money, but this is one of his best.  Dylan plays with The Band, and all of the songs are excellent.<br />Bob Dylan is not known for love songs, but this album has several excellent love songs.  WEDDING SONG is arguably the strongest, most passionate love song ever written by anyone.<br />By the way, if you have not seen Bob Dylan live recently, you are missing out.  He has once again implemented a new, original style.  I would classify it as a driving, hard, blues-rock; it is outstanding.  See the Houston Chronicle review of the April 22, 2003 performance.

0380002930|5.0|This has been officially my \\"favorite book\\" since age 10 (which was 18 years ago.)  I still love it.  If you've only read it once, it's possible you would get even more out of it the second or third time.  The evocative themes are very relevant to moral choices you might make at any stage of life.  The integrity and courage of the rabbit heroes is astonishing.  Appreciation of the writing inspires you to be a better person--braver and kinder.  Nothing else compares to the adventure and relevance of this impressive literary work.  One thing I noticed more as I grew older is the natural beauty of the English countryside Adams describes, and the sad theme of humans destroying the environment and habitats of animals.
B000002952|5.0|An astonishingly assured effort by Gloria Estefan, considered by many Gloriaphiles to be her best work. This sounds like an album of Afrocubanismo standards, like Linda Ronstadt's &quot;Frenesi.&quot; Unlike Ms. Ronstadt's masterpiece, however, the songs on &quot;Mi Tierra&quot; are mostly original songs, many written by Gloria herself or by the great Estefano (who has written hits for Chayanne, Azucar Moreno, Paulina Rubio, Thalia, etc.). &quot;Con los anos que me quedan&quot; starts the CD off with a powerfully emotional ballad about making the most of life, fitting for an artist who survived a near-fatal bus crash. &quot;Mi tierra&quot; is Estefano's tribute to Gloria's homeland, and it wisely addresses it from a nostalgic, rather than political, perspective. &quot;Ayer&quot; is a lovely piece by Juanito Marquez, with a gorgeous chorus like the gentle lapping of warm ocean waves. &quot;Mi buen amor&quot; is another gentle Estefano song, this time with a gorgeous flute accompaniment by Nestor Torres. &quot;Tus ojos&quot; is lively and dancey, co-written by Emilio, who is often the rhythm behind Gloria's melodies. &quot;No hay mal que por bien no venga,&quot; written by Cachao, has some gorgeous vocals by Jon Secada as well as stirring strings and woodwinds. It sounds very big band. &quot;Si senor!&quot; is a fiesty, fiery &quot;son&quot; of a song, seemingly infused with &quot;la aroma de albahaca y hierbabuena&quot; of Cuba and the beautiful Cuban people. &quot;Volveras&quot; slows down the pace, giving Gloria an opportunity to torch it up a bit. Not one of my favourite songs on the CD, this piece is nonetheless a great showcase for Gloria's voice. &quot;Montuno&quot; is another irresistable &quot;son,&quot; written by Marquez. &quot;Hablemos el mismo idioma&quot; and &quot;Tradicion,&quot; both co-written by the Estefans and thus deeply personal, are completely infused with movement and joy. The former reminds me of &quot;Oye mi canto&quot; from &quot;Cuts BothWays.&quot; In between these lively songs, we have the slow, sultry &quot;Hablas de mi,&quot; another perfect showcase for Gloria's range. &quot;Tradicion&quot; is a perfect song to end on, since it expresses the credo of the Estefans: to continue the musical traditions of their forebears--Tito Puente, Celia Cruz, Israel Lopez Cachao, Arturo Sandoval, etc. This CD manages to mix these Cuban influences with the old crew from Miami Sound Machine, add some great songwriting, and it all amounts to one of the greatest Latin language CDs of our time.
B00004XONN|5.0|Like most of Radiohead stuff, Kid A takes loads of listenings to be a benefit to you. The only difference with this is that it takes even more because it is so complicated. Its up to you, you can listen to Linkin Park's simple music every day that all sounds the same, or you can listen to this where every track is unique, clever and generally damn good when you get into it.<br />I often find that songs which are harder to like end up being better.
0316666343|5.0|A friend gave this book to me to read. I had no real interest at first. But I was sucked in by just the first chapter. Alice Sebold puts a new spin on Heaven and the way it may actually be for the deceased. This book is full of fatastic imagery and wonderful insight into just how our loved ones may be watching over us from above. It's a very heartbreaking tale of a family's struggle to live life again once they've lost a close family member to a tragic and too early death. It does get a little creepy and supernatural here and there. But overall, it's the best story of struggle and coping I've read since \\"She's Come Undone.\\"
B00005B4GU|4.0|This album sounds terrible at first and takes a lot of patience to appreciate. However, it ends up a great album, though unique to Radiohead. I think it is better if you have heard some of the earlier stuff before you get this because otherwise you won't understand it, or appreciate how intelligent it is, as much. I don't think there are many other bands that are capable of being so original. This album is abnormal like Kid A, and is good, like Kid A. However, I have to say that I think Kid A is better.<br />'Packt Like Sardines In A Crushed Tin Box' is one of easier songs to get into, though a keyboard tune. It is fairly catchy song buts fades when you get into the more dodgy stuff on the album. Rating out of 5: 4<br />'The pyramid song' is a nice but miserable track (surprise surprise): one of the singles. Very memorable and powerful tune that builds up well. 5<br />'Pulk/Pull Revolving Doors' is a really wierd track. One of those that takes some time to get into It is more likeable if you know what the lyrics are about... who ever thought doors could be so creepy? It is a difficult but clever song. 4<br />'You and Whose Army' is a very miserable sounding song that builds up. It is clever and catchy, in a wierd way. 4<br />'I Might be Wrong' was another single for the album. It is a bit more accessable than most of the other tracks and catchy. 4<br />'Knives out': the sixth track' was the other single. Parallel track 6 in Kid A (optimistic), it is the only one that involves the whole band, and none of those wierd sound effects ect. Thus, you should like this one whoever you are. 4<br />'Morning Bell/Amnesiac'...wierd (used that word a lot)... strange. I don't think it's much good, definetley not as good as the original version in Kid A and one of the lowlights of the album, though quite clever. 3<br />'Dollars and Cents' is one that everyone likes but I have got a bit sick of hearing it. It is a bit cheesy but one of the best -on your first listenings. 4<br />'Hunting Bears' is a little interesting two minute interval tune that they shoved in the album. It sounds ba at first but, as I said, is quite interesting. 4<br />'Like Spinning Plates' sounds as dodgy as hell. It is difficult to like but after forcing myself to listening to it, I like it. 4<br />'Life in a Glasshouse' is one involving a little orchestra. Again, it sounds bad at first but is actually decent in its own way. 4
B00005JLEU|5.0|I rented this movie on hearing that it was supposed to be good. I was a big fan of anime in my high school days and have kind oif gotten out of that loop. My general disappointment with most anime is that translation is bad and before DVD usually all you could get was the English dub. Then usually the English dubs are terrible. I was veryimpresed though with the ability to view the film in both english and japanese with english subtitles. Also, the English dub is rather impressive. It almost word for word matches the Japanese subtutles and takes a little bit of lisence making the language more natural. The subtitles are very cut and dry. The English language track on the DVD is one of the best I've heard. Disney really went all out on this one. The story is really an amazing one. It's very compelling. One would think that a 2 hour animated film is toomuch but this movie is well worth the 2 hours. It is really a great film. All i can say is wow. Though the second disc of the set is really kind of worthless. There are a couple neat little things but all in all there isn't too much to get excited about, but the movie makes up for it! It's awesome!
B00008NG5V|5.0|I'd never heard of Jack Johnson until this past December when visiting my brother-in-law. Was I under a rock? Perhaps.  I was mesmerized by the gentle, yet captivating sounds of &quot;Bushfire Fairytales&quot;. His sound steers clear from the bee-boppy sounds of pop and instead takes you to a laid back cool place of toe tapping in the sand--even if you're not at the beach.  IMHO, &quot;On And On&quot; is bigger and better with a slightly more pacific sound.  It's refreshing, fun, and for this 20 something hipchic, rocks!  If you're tired of Justin, Christina, and Papa Roach and want to take on some tunes with a mellow fresh sound, this one's for you.
B00006CXXU|5.0|I've always been a fan of Christina Aguilera ever since \\"Genie In A Bottle\\" came out, but when I bought \\"Stripped\\" it made me think if this is really worth my money after listening to the unsuccessful and weak single \\"Dirrty\\". After I heard the whole album, I was extremely pleased with the content. Every song on \\"Stripped\\" could be a potential single. The first single does not fit in with the rest of the album and if Christina chose a different song as the first single then I personally think that the album could have done better on its first week sales. I bought \\"Stipped\\" the day it came out and until now, I still listen to it nonstop. The following singles - \\"Beautiful\\" is an amazing ballad, and \\"Fighter\\", a dark and rock-mixed song, are great song choices that show Christina's musical diversity and vocal talent. <br />My favourite songs on the album are \\"Impossible\\", \\"Cruz\\", \\"Keep On Singin' My Song\\", \\"Imfatuation\\", and the forth-coming R&B single \\"Can't Hold Us Down\\". If you are looking for an album that is filled with great songs and amazing vocals, then this is the one for you. Each song is very diversed and Christina has proven that she can sing any type of music in this album. Christina will no longer be compared to bubbly-teen-pop singers like Britney Spears and Jessica Simpson. I strongly reccomend this album.  <br />I expect Christina to win every single award in the near future for this incredible record. And this easily is one of the best female albums of 2002/2003. So if your do not own this CD yet, I encourage you to go and buy it right now. It certainly is worth your money and it will not dissapoint.
0876855575|5.0|There it is. Somebody wrote earlier that Bukowski is the most underrated writer of all times. If you wonder if that is true, buy this novel, read it and decide for yourself. This book is so powerful, that writing a review is hard. One does not want to sound like a hardcore fan because it would mean that the rating of the book is questionable. But it is a 5-Star-Book, it always was, it always will be. This country is slowly discovering the best writer they had for decades. Be a part of it.
B000000JO3|5.0|\\"Amazing\\" is usually a really crappy word to use to describe albums.  It's a word overused by high school freshmen to describe their Thursday albums.  However, in this case, I can think of few other words to describe this record than \\"amazing\\".<br />In case you've been living under a rock, or watching a lot of MTV, Minor Threat is a Washington DC hardcore punk band from the mid 80s who never failed to create some awesome music.  If you're an average radio-listening music fan, chances are, you don't like hardcore.  This album could very well change that.  This was my first true hardcore record and has since got me into bands such as Black Flag and the Bad Brains.  At the time I got this, I was listening to mostly '77 punk rock bands such as the Ramones, the Clash, the Sex Pistols, and Stiff Little Fingers.  I got this record, popped it in my CD player, and proceeded to be beaten up.  Compared to Minor Threat, the other punk bands I was listening to sounded like adult-contemporary.  I was truly amazed at how much energy could be flowing through a band and its music at one time.  I listened to the whole record in one sitting, and have since listened to it countless times.  It simply never gets old.  Before I heard this, I didn't believe that an album could be \\"life-changing\\".  Well, this one is.  Because of this album, I've gotten into so many bands (Black Flag, Bad Brains, Circle Jerks, Germs, et al) that I would have never heard of if I didn't buy this.  Even though this is extremely hardcore, it occasionally takes some time to slow down and even employ (gasp!) some meoldy.  Songs like \\"Cashing in\\" and \\"Think again\\" are good examples of this idea.  They're a bit slower, less abrasive, and catchier than most of the songs on the record (which doesn't mean they don't rock HARD).  Minor Threat is a kind of gateway to hardcore.  Though they're not the BEST hardcore band (that honor would go to the Bad Brains), they're definitely the most accessible (and 2nd best).  If you're completely new to hardcore, or if you're already in to it, this album is definitely worth your money.  It's an absolute essential in any punk collection and if you don't have it, you don't know what you're missing.ou're completely new to hardcore, or if you're already in to it, this album is definitely worth your money.

B000002UA9|4.0|Please Please Me, The Beatles' first recorded LP is a fine example of rock and roll at its rawest.  You probably know the hits (I Saw Her Standing There, Love Me Do, Please Please Me), but if you're new to the Beatles, you'll be pleased to find &quot;There's a Place,&quot; one of the most underrated Beatles songs ever.  There are also some nice covers in &quot;Anna&quot; and &quot;Misery.&quot;  Ringo sings &quot;Boys&quot; and George Harrison sings the Lennon/McCartney original &quot;Do You Want to Know a Secret?&quot;  The Beatles' cover of &quot;Twist and Shout&quot; closes out the debut album of the best band ever!  <br />Only 4 stars because the Beatles are still in their early stages of songwriting.  Some of their lyrics are a little silly, and there are 6 covers on this album.  If you're one of those fans who is really into the Sgt. Pepper and later stuff and think that this is too poppy, you should probably give it another try.  Some of the songs on this album are more rock than a lot of the popular &quot;rock&quot; music today.  Good music from the greatest band ever!
B00000K0EA|5.0|After his superb performance in Goldeneye, I had high hopes for his next film.... And I wasent dissapointed one bit!!! I cant remember many bond films that had so much action in it.  A very interesting villin in Eliot Carver who wants to start WW3 just to cover it for his news company. What a Freak!! And his assitant Mr.Stamper was really cool because he reminded me of Ol' Red Grant from \\"From Russia With Love\\", he acted, looked and felt like him. Really cool sceans, action, and for once, a female in the series that met bond pound for pound in Wei Lin. She was cool being she RARELY needed or wanted Bonds help cuz she could take care of herself .  They looked like Roger Moore did with Barbra Bach as xxx, as both of there goverments The UK and the USSR were trying to stop WW3 in (The Spy Who Loved ME) like Pierce Brosnan and Wei Lin were doing For The UK and China. Coencedence??? U decide. Overall great movie, A MUST HAVE!!
B00008LOS1|5.0|Dont pay any attention to the review by music fan from San Fransisco. He must have had wax in his ears. The second disc is the reason to own this CD.<BR>Although the Young Vic shows were considered rehersals by The Who, it's amazing how well they play together. The entire band is outstanding throughout.<BR>My only complaint is that the entire show was not released on a 2 disc set seperate from Who's Next. Several songs from Tommy were left out as well as the previously released &quot;Baby dont you do it&quot; and &quot;Bonie Maronie&quot;. All should have been included to give a better idea of what a Who concert was like in 1971.<BR>Buy it. Any live Who recordings from the Keith Moon era are worth owning.
B000002LQR|5.0|Blood Sugar Sex Magik is one of, if not the best album of the 1990's.  Its the Chili Pepper's best cd, and is simply incredible.  The sound they put out is better and more addictive than anything I've ever heard.  It's funky, the tunes are great, the songs are exciting and unlike anything else.  They're led by Flea's stellar Bass Guitar, with Frusciante's Hendrix-like guitar playing usually supporting him.  Anythony's vioce is also one of the most consistent and recognizable in music.   The album is a lot different the later ones like Californication, and also different from the previous ones.  Overall though it is the pinnicle of the best band of the last 15 years.  Blood Sugar Sex Magik is also the first cd where Anthony sings in his signature voice heard in the later albums, before this one he sounded totally different.  The core of the Chili's greatness though lies in the guiter of John Frusciante and the bass guiter of Flea.  Also, Chad Smith is a top-notch drummer who can handle basically anything.  All of them reach their full potential on this album.  Having two of the best guitar players ever in one band is what makes them so amazing.  Whenever I listen to something right after I listen to the Chili Peppers it often seems dull and boring, and I find myself going right back to my favorite band.  The best songs on the cd are, in order, Blood Sugar Sex Magik, Suck My Kiss, Under The Bridge, Breaking The Girl, Funky Monks, Apache Rose Peacock, Give it Away, If You Have to Ask.  Every single song is good though, which adds even more to the greatness of this album.  Most albums nowadays have about 2-3 good songs and 15 fillers.  I've never met anyone who didn't love this cd and the Chili Peppers in general, and it is a must buy for any one who likes music.
B00007JVBI|4.0|Cat Power is the ill-conceived pseudonym of                       singer/songwriter/pianist Chan Marshall. Prior to                 this cd, Ms. Power's most successful album was                    generically titled The Covers Record, in which                   she performed covers of songs by other artists,                  including a version of 'Satisfaction' which, we're                guessing, Messrs Jagger and Richards would                       have a hard time recognizing as their own. (Of                    course, judging strictly by appearances, we                       surmise that Mr. Richards would have difficulty                   recognizing his own reflection.) Whether singing                  folk, country, or even punkishly rocking out,                     Ms. Power (we can't bring ourselves to call her                   Cat) always sounds as if she's afraid of waking                   the baby in the next room. Her voice has the                      paradoxical ability to be both haunting and                       soothing at the same time. Likewise, her lyrics                   yin/yang between the elliptical and the direct,                   the melancholy and the hopeful. Her songs are                     shaped differently than the usual verse-chorus                    pattern to which pop music fans are accustomed.                   With their repetitive lines and sparse and                       sparser arrangements, they are like chants,                       capable of putting the listener into a trance-like                state. At certain points on the record, we must                  admit, we have actually been pleasantly lulled to                 sleep. We always make sure we're awake,                          however, for the 2 songs in which, Ms. Power's                    airy delivery is given ballast by the earthly drone               credited to &quot;E.V.&quot;, which we're speculating is                    either Eddie Vedder or Erich Von Stroheim (but                   that would probably be &quot;E.V.S.&quot;). Whether                         conscious or asleep, we find Cat Power to be a                    unique and compelling artist, unlike anyone else                 in the pop world at this time.
B000069HKH|1.0|Bruce has now and again written a song that is not entirely without substance, not not very often. It is just too hard to get past the sound of his alleged voice, and the sound of that souped up bar band from New Jersey. Apparently Bruce fans don;t care much, they are sucked in by something that I can not see, much the same way that hordes of the dim are drawn to N'sync and other talentless droids. This record waves the flag in an insidiously clever way. Anyone who writes songs exploiting the 9/11 disaster should be strung up.
B00007H1Y2|4.0|This is a primarily instrumental album featuring the              entwining guitar play of these 2 brilliant                        musicians. With its subtle nuances, knotty                        arrangements and complex time changes, the                        more one listens to it, the better this cd                        becomes, Although some of these songs would                       fit easily on 'The Buena Vista' cd, this one seems                more exploratory, less formal. Aside from the                     traditional Afro-Cuban voicings one would                        expect, we also discern the sounds of surf                        guitar, Hawiian slack key guitar, and sounds that                 are simply (if we may pull out our all-time                       favorite, home-made adjective) Esquivelish.                      Employing other Cuban members of The BVC                          along with such American luminaries as Jim                       Keltner and Herb Alpert, Cooder has once again                    expanded his musical vocabulary and ours.
0810945797|5.0|I have wanted this book for so long. When it came back into print I was so happy. It lived up to my expectations. The illustrations and creativity are breathtaking. The book is a must for all artist and art lovers!

0156027321|5.0|This book is both funny and serious, following someone survive against impossible odds, but revealing lots about his cultural background and the cultures he adopted along the way.<br />While it did not by itself make me believe in god (you'll have to read it to understand why I mention this) it certainly comes close.<br />One of the best reads I have had in a long time.
B00006WUWP|1.0|This was the most self-aggrandizing of Mike Myers' &quot;Austin&quot; movies to date. The first one was fun, the second one was entertaining enough, but definitely needed some re-work, but this movie -- with its little &quot;Hollywood Insider&quot; bits and Myers'egotistical performance made me wonder how he gets his head through most doors. I watched it once and was sorry to have wasted my time. Rent this one before you buy. You may not think it'll deserve a second viewing.
B000068PQ0|3.0|The hooks on this album are nearly as numerous as the hooks in Seattle.  Scandalously, though, they are hooks which were first embedded in the songs of genuine artists who trawled emotional depths--far beyond the threshold of suffering of those impressed by Yoshimi Battles the Pink Robots.  Thus: whistling, the much vaunted, Morning of the Magicians, one finds that one is actually recalling Gordon Lightfoot's beautifully poignant Early Morning Rain.  Other hooks trigger reminiscences of songs by: Leo Sayer; Annie Lennox; Danny Whitten; and, notoriously: Cat Stevens (now called Yusuf Islam).  I am not saying that Flaming Lips have deliberately cherry-picked all the wonderful chord structures originally sweated over by better musicians--and then tossed them into this syrupy sweet confection of an album; but I could say that quite truthfully! Anyway, it's still worth buying.  If you are in to psychedelia--and tired of listening to Forever Changes-- this is less of a swizz than the Coral album was. And I agree that 'Ego Trippin' at the Gates of Hell' is five star--up there with Good Vibrations!
0385504209|5.0|What a fun book to read! The fact-based trivia are clear evidence of the author's research efforts which make the story even more entertaining. Even though he doesn't understand GPS capabilities (nor does Clive Cussler - a wristwatch GPS will NOT work in a submarine deep underwater), it's a minor matter and doesn't really detract from the fast-paced story. Now I'm off to the library to take another look at Da Vinci's paintings...
B000084T18|1.0|Just when the rap game was getting too redundant and cliche, 50 Cent comes out.This album has all the production to be a classic, but there is no originality to the lyrics and style. Rap music needs a savior if this is it's future.
B00007L4MJ|5.0|Fritz Lang's METROPOLIS was very successful with both critics and audiences when it debuted in 1927 Berlin--but it was thereafter edited for distribution by Channing Pollock, who disliked it and removed great chunks of the film and substantially altered the storyline.  The resulting film was admired for its visual style, but it proved a critical and box office disappointment.  Neglected in the wake of sound, surviving prints of the film were left to corrode and decay--and when it began to reach the home market via VHS and DVD the results were very hit or miss; Blackhawk released a fairly credible version of the truncated film to home video, but for the most part the quality of these releases varied from barely mediocre to downright unwatchable.<br /><br />Until now.<br /><br />A great chunk of METROPOLIS--perhaps as much a quarter of more--has been forever lost, but this Kino Video DVD release offers the single best version of the film available.  The previously cut footage that still exists has been restored; gaps in the film have been bridged by the occasional use of stills and explanatory title cards; the film itself has been painstakingly and digitally restored; and the soundtrack is the Gottfried Huppertz original created for the film's 1927 Berlin debut. In seeing this version of METROPOLIS, I was struck by how very differently it reads from the previously available truncated version.  The visual style and the story itself are much more exciting and cohesive, and in the wake of this restoration it becomes impossible to deny the film status as landmark of international cinema.<br /><br />Freder Fredersen (Gustav Frohlich) is the son of Joh Fredersen (Alfred Able), who reigns over the great city of Metropolis.  Freder is surprised to discover his lifestyle has been built on the unseen but backbreaking labor of an entire class of unseen workers who tend the machines that make the city run--and he descends to the subterranean levels of Metropolis in an effort to understand their lives... and, not incidentally, to find the mysterious but beautiful woman Maria (Brigitta Helm) who has inspired his interest in the workers' plight.  But his father is concerned by both Freder's interest and Maria's activities among the workers, and he turns to scientist C.A. Rotwang (Rudolf Klein-Rogge) for aid.  Rotwang has created a robot, and he agrees to give it the likeness of Maria in order to undermine both Freder's love for the girl and her own activities.  But Rotwang has a hidden agenda of his own: once the robot has been unleashed, he will use her to destroy Metropolis and thereby exact revenge on Joh Fredersen for past transgressions against him.<br /><br />In many respects the story is simplistic, but the film's visual style and connotations are anything but.  Deeply influenced by such art movements as Expressionism, Objectivism, Art Deco, and Bauhaus, the film is visually fascinating--not only in its scenic designs, but in director Lang's famous skill at creating the powerful crowd scenes that dominate the film and building the pace and tension of the film as it moves toward an intense climax.  But while one can--and many do--admire the film purely at this level, there is quite a lot going on in terms of philosophical content as well: while it offers few viable solutions, the film raises such issues as the relationship between capital and labor, the place of religion in modern society, human reaction to overwhelming technology, and (perhaps most interestingly) the drift of government into a class-conscious corporate entity.  And religious motifs abound in the film: a largely deserted cathedral; Moloch; the Tower of Babel; and crosses--intriguingly juxtaposed with a repeating motif of the pentagram-like designs associated with the robot.  It is fascinating stuff.<br /><br />There has been complaint that this restoration runs at incorrect speed and the performances are therefore unnecessarily jerky.  I did not find this to be the case.In certain instances the movement is deliberately jerky and mechanical--the workers are a case in point--but beyond this there is nothing for which the difference between silent acting and modern acting techniques cannot account.  There has also been some complaint that the title cards should have been left in their original German and translated via subtitle.  There is a certain validity to this, but it seems a minor quibble; title cards were typically translated in the silent era itself.  The DVD includes a number of extras, including still photographs, biographies of the major figures involved in the film, and two interesting documentaries-one on the restoration process and one on the creation of the film itself.  Both are interesting; the audio commentary track by film historian Enno Patalas, however, is mildly disappointing.  But when all is said and done, it is the film that counts.  And this restoration is a remarkable achievement, to say the least, a project which brings a great landmark of world cinema back from the edge of the abyss.  Indispensible; a must-own.<br /><br />--GFT (Amazon Reviewer)--In certain instances the movement is deliberately jerky and mechanical--the workers are a case in point--but beyond this there is nothing for which the difference between silent acting and modern acting techniques cannot account.

B000002JOH|5.0|This is one of the best albums I have ever heard in my metal life. These guys know how to play hard as hell without compromise. Tracks 1,4,& 6 are perfect songs when your in your car at a red light next to some conservative people who need to be startled. Walk and This Love where songs from the album that got commercial success without selling out the band. It goes to show that Pantera can also make songs that don't have to be headbashers, but their slam pit anthems are really the greatest!! Phil sings and screams with power, Dimebag Darrell wails out riffs and solos cunningly, Vinnie Paul taps and pounds the skins with the best of them, and Rex keeps the tempo.If you've heard of Pantera but never heard their music( where have you been living?), start your collection with this one because it is their best.
B00008NG5V|4.0|i mean, rolling stone gave it 2 stars because there was nothing unprecedented about it.  but who cares?  if you liked his first album, you'll definitely LOVE this release, and for those who haven't even heard of him, you will be absolutely amazed by his laid back voice.  Someone mentioned earlier that its basically a continuation of his first album, which i would have to say i agree, but again, there is nothing wrong with that.  A few songs that will probably be playing in a radio station near you because of its catchy hooks.  <BR>&quot;Traffic in the Sky&quot; &quot;Holes to Heaven&quot; &quot;Dreams be Dreams&quot;
B00003CXPJ|5.0|If you love classics like Bill & Ted, Wayne's World, Dumb & Dumber or even Beavis & Butthead, this is your kind of movie.  The movie is so ridiculous that it truly is amazing.  What is nice about this comedy is that they go after a new target instead of staying with fart jokes and stupid stunts.  The movie blasts the modeling world and especially male models and goes into an absurd storyline that is priceless.  <br />The cast makes this movie.  Without Ben and Jerry Stiller, Owen Wilson or Will Ferrell, this movie would be trash.  But these boys took trash and created treasure.  Some people will never get this movie, that's just the way things are, but I know there are other people out there that love this kind of stuff and will want to watch it multiple times, so get the DVD cause it has some cool features as well.
B00008PX8P|5.0|WOW, I just got my copy of the Zeppelin DVD and How The <BR>West Was Won audio CDs. This is truly amazing vintage <BR>live Rock And Roll. The 70' Royal Albert Hall is of <BR>excellent quality and over 90 minutes. Vintage live<BR>Page,Plant,Jonesy,and Bonham. The video quality is 9<BR>out of 10 and and the audio on the DVD is a &quot;10&quot;.<BR>The 3CD How The West Was Won audio set live from the<BR>LA Forum 72' is by far the best live Zeppelin I have<BR>heard in 25 years. <br />Well worth the purchase price for both the DVDs and <BR>audio CDs.<br />JP
B000000WCA|5.0|Back in the late 90's if you didn't own this cd, you just weren't hip. Now in 2003, you if you still have it, well, you just aren't. The five spices came to America to conquer and they did. From 1996-1998, the Spice Girls ruled the world, selling out concerts and racking up #1 albums and singles. Then, the spice wasn't right for, \\"Ginger,\\" Geri Halliwell quit the band. This album will go down in history for being one the most sold albums by a female group ever, and it is a shame the spice isn't going strong. But, here is a more in depth look at the songs and what I rate them out of five stars.<br />1.Wannabe - ***** -If you have not heard this song yet, you do not derserve to know what it is like.<BR>2.Say You'll Be There - ***** - Great up tempo pop.<BR>3.2 Become 1 - ***** - A winter ballad, it sold over 5 million copies worldwide.<BR>4.Love Thing - **** - First of the fillers, hip hop song. <BR>5.Last Time Lover - **** - Another filler, not much going on here, the same as before.<br />6.Mama - **** - Title says it all, ode to yo mama. Slow ballad.<BR>7.Who Do You Think You Are? - ***** - Another fast pop song, like something Christina Aguilera or Britney would sing back in '99.<BR>8.Something Kinda Funny - **** - Not much of a difference than tracks 4 & 5.<BR>9.Naked - ***** - More of a seductive, dirty song. Slow.<BR>10.If U Can't Dance - ***** - Easily one of the best tracks on the album.
B00008LDPU|5.0|As far as this DVD goes. From what I've seen on the matrix web site.  They are shorts that kind of give you more insight/background about the matrix as a whole by chroniciling various events, happenings in the matrix from others who have escaped.
B000002H6C|5.0|...And Justice for All is considered by many as Metallica's most progressive and complicated work to date.<br />Don't listen to this album expecting any catchy/funky tunes. The whole album is filled with rage, despair and sorrow without any sign of hope. Most of the songs are about war, society, bad parenting, the justice system etc., My personal favorites are the anthemic \\"One\\" (about the destructive effects of war), the epic \\"To Live is to Die\\" (RIP Cliff Burton), the fast \\"Blackened\\" (about the destruction of Earth due to nuclear war ?!), the riff-laden \\"Eye of the Beholder\\" (about the real meaning of Freedom), the heavy \\"Harvester of Sorrow\\" and the title track (about the failed justice system).<br />One of Metallica's unique abilities is their surgical precision when it comes to delivering mind-numbingly fast riffs, and they have taken this to extreme in this album. But it never gets boring thanks to some incredible solos by the talented Kirk Hammet, and some intelligent 'gear-shifting' now and then. If you listen to the whole album in one sitting, you will end up feeling that you have just listened to a 70-minute collection of riffs and solos interwoven with some intelligent lyrics, instead of 9 separate songs... and that is what I like the most about this one.<br />If you are a serious Metallica fan, you already have this one. If all you know about Metallica are the Black Album, Load and Reload, then you must definitely give this one a try. You will be surprised.
B00000AFWW|5.0|andrew parodi, i think you need to learn the meaning of punk rock angst before you even attempt at reviewing pretty on the inside. just one opinoin of someone who doesnt know any better<BR>cheers
B000066NW0|1.0|I have observed people's love and backlash against Avril for quiet some time now.  And here is what I have to say.  Avril Lavigne is quiet possibly the most fake person in the music industry.  More fake than Britney Spears even.  Avril writes her own songs: WRONG!  She writes them with the help of about three other PROFESSIONAL POP songwriters.  Meaning that she contributed maybe a line or two.  She has guitar-playing talent.  WRONG!  She holds the guitar and poses with it in pictures in order to look cool.  She can't actually play it or else she would play it live, but she doesn't.  Her band does.  She's punk. WRONG!  She's pop-rock.  And not even good pop-rock like maybe Savage Garden or Matchbox 20, both of whom can be creative and write far more meaningful lyrics.  She can sing.  WRONG!  One only needs to see and hear her live to realize that she has no singing voice and that her voice is perfectly synthesized.  She never claimed to be punk.  WRONG!  When she first appeared she claimed that she re-invented punk-rock for this generation and was this generation's Sid Vicious (never mind that later she admitted that she didn't even know who Sid Vicious was).  She ultimately is just some wannabe who was picked by a major record label to cash in on Britney's now-waning fan-base with the same safe, bubblegummy songs about puppy love that shallow people eat up.  That is all
B000002GK1|4.0|Badmotorfinger, largely unknown by the mainstream in spite of the fact that it was released on a major label and enjoyed some mainstream air and MTV play, is Soundgarden's second best effort (behind the five-star swan song Down on the Upside).<br />While Down on the Upside is melancholy and introverted in nature, Badmotorfinger is like a cross between the ten-ton tuned-down riffing of Black Sabbath, the epic, spiritual wail of Led Zeppelin and the machine yards at Kenworth.<br />Singles which actually got airplay like Outshined or Rusty Cage stand out not as high points, but as weak spots in the album's material. The real meat here is in emotionally blues-inspired but supremely heavy, somewhat dissonant, awkwardly cerebral tracks like Room a Thousand Years Wide and Slaves and Bulldozers. It's in these tracks that Cornell's voice soars slowly and deliberately above the band's magnificent, reluctant, straining, iron-age sound -- a sound which has never been duplicated by another band or indeed by Soundgarden themselves on later releases.
1587990717|5.0|The author is extremely independent minded which makes him stand out either as very confident or very arrogant but it is not the case. He is just extremely scornful of success but has empathy for failure. He seems to derive some pleasure offending those who made money because they happened to be right there when the phone rang that day and are now boasting of their accomplishments. He also seems to make hordes of people who were not there when the phone rang better about their own skills and accomplishments.<BR>I keep reading a lot about Taleb these days as his ideas are gaining currency (people seem to rush to hear him speak --his speech is in contrast with his work soft and low-key). It is sometimes ironic to see people whom Taleb considers as intellectually his inferiors (like Barton Biggs) promote his work. <br />I can t wait for his next work
B00005JL2O|1.0|Ok, I wanna start out by saying that Mike Myers IS (or at least WAS) a comedic genius. We can see that for sure based on Wayne's World, So I Married an Axe Murder, and yes, even the first two Austin Powers movies. But this last one...oh man. Can I tell you, I actually walked out of the theater. And I NEVER walk out of movies.<br />How many times can you do the same joke and have people still laugh? Apparently, only twice, the third is too much.<br />The beginning, is amazing, but after the hysterical opening sequence, it all goes down hill. Fat Bastard's painfully long description of the smell of his passed gas, the Mole's mole gag that went on for five minutes too long (and five minutes might as well be an hour in comic timing), the cheesy \\"Mr. Roboto\\" joke- it was HORRIBLE! I mean, in the scene with Dr. Evil and Mini-Me doing a rap song (AGAIN), NO ONE was laughing, and I was looking at the fire exits to plan my quickest escape.<br />Seriously, Mike, I know you can do better. This one's a stinko, plain and simple.
B00005JLSE|5.0|I am a fan of the Broadway musical format and had been hoping for a movie version of Chicago every since seeing the stage version reviewed on the Charlie Rose show.  This movie version meets my hopes and expectations.  It is fast paced and moves faultlessly from semi-realism to fantasy in the blink of an eye.  The Fosse-esque dance scenes are wonderful and the singing is very good.  I was sorry when the movied was over.<br />There have been some complaints about the plot but, like almost all musicals, this isn't a movie that you go to see as an example of cinematic skill in plot development.  The plot is almost comic-book simple, like the movie Dick Tracy which starred Madonna.  You go for the dancing, the music, the pretty women, the singing, etc.  <br />Considering that the movie musical has been out of style for a while, they probably didn't have a long list of potential actors for the roles - I think, however, that the actors did very well, especially Zeta-Jones.  Liza Minelli at her best might have done better in that part as she had a truly outstanding voice but I can't think of anyone available now who might have bettered Zeta.  I have not been a Richard Gere fan but maybe that is because he has been miscast, in this role he was great.  Zellweger had the biggest stretch to make from her background.  You wonder how the director decided on her since she was the greatest gamble.  Madonna might have done that part ten years or so ago but I can't think of anyone else with a name who could have done it better than Rene.  All in all, everyone associated with this movie rates kudos.  I will buy the DVD version, but if you haven't seen the movie, see it on the biggest screeen available in your area first.
B0000640VO|5.0|Amelie a modern-day fairy tale love story of a young lady with a large imagination, who was friendless for her entire childhood. All she ever wanted was someone like her to share her creative and unique out-look on life. This film is sweet, adorable, funny, uplifting, magical,tender, heartwarming (without being cheesy) and best of all- FRENCH (not for those who can't stand sub-titles). Amelie reminds us all what we wish life was like and reminds us of the child inside that might have once been lost. Full of quirky humor, mischeif, brilliant cinematography, an essential soundtrack and a timeless story.
B00008PW3Q|1.0|Simply dreadful effort. One or two decent songs but fo rthe most part the Nicks songs drone on and on in a monotone and Buckingham's start out promising and lapse quickly into insanity. He needs a producer with a very strong will. If they felt compelled to include &quot;Bleed to Love Her&quot; they should have used the far better live recording from &quot;The Dance&quot;
B00008AY3L|3.0|I usually only write reviews about albums that move me and so this is actually a departure for me.<br /><br />I am a Ben Harper fan but found myself a bit disappointed with some of the new areas explored by this album.  The first track is catchy and very much like Bob Marley with the I three's backing up, however, its a bit of a \\"pat\\" reggae tune without much depth.  Fun to listen to but not earthshattering.<br /><br />The remainder of the album is hit or miss, the more Mr. Harper goes to the electric guitar the less interested I become in the album.<br /><br />That being said, the best tracks are vintage Harper:  Amen, Omen and Diamonds on the Inside are beautifully brillant.<br /><br />Amen, Omen has lyrics that are some of the best poetry I've heard in years. I offer that only to give a feel for the depth of the lyrics which foretell of the pain and uncertainty of \\"moving on\\" and \\"being let down\\" from a great relationship that is displayed on this track.  It reminds me of the cover he did on the live album of Richard Ashcroft's \\"The Drugs Don't Work,\\" and is equally chilling when you get right down to it.<br /><br />Diamonds on the Inside is a song that also has a very nice lyrical quality and the guitar hook (which is almost like something off Led Zeppelin III) is very very catchy.  \\"I met a girl, her name was truth...she was a horrible liar,\\" lines like this are just so perfect in terms of \\"telling it like it is\\" and I wish the rest of the album was as good as these two songs.<br /><br />If you are a Ben Harper fan, you'll enjoy the album but won't be blown away by this effort.
B00006RIO7|5.0|This is a first rate CD of show tunes from the Miramax's Oscar- winning movie, _Chicago_.  All the cast are very talented, abd the songs are well sung, with feeling and excellent instrumental back ups.  Highlights include Queen Latifah's &quot;When You're Good to Mama,&quot; and Richard Gere's &quot;Razzle Dazzle.&quot;  _Chicago_ was one of the best movies of 2003, and this soundtrack showcases it beautifully. Highly recommeneded.
B000089A07|5.0|This was an excellent movie.  I was never a fan of Edward Norton until I saw this movie.  After watching this movie I wanted to join the FBI and rid the world of these hideous human beings known as serial killers.  The crime scene work in this movie was excellent and the way Norton transformed his thought to that of the &quot;Tooth Fairy&quot; aka the Red Dragon aka Francis Dolarhyde was brilliant.  Those expecting a &quot;who did it movie&quot; this is not it.  That aspect of the movie is what I like best.  It gives a lot of character developement to the Red Dragon.<br />Anthony Hopkins as Hannibal was again brilliant.  His role was lesson considerably from Hannibal and Silence of the Lambs but it only made you yearn for more of him.  I love the beginning of the movie when it shows how Lecter is captured.<br />The only thing that was dissapointment was that there was not that many killings.  I know it sound sick, but in the movies it is ok and adds to how the killer is really insane.  <br />overall this is the best movie I have bought this year.  I can not wait until the fourth installment of &quot;The Cannibal&quot;
B00006CXXU|5.0|\\"Stripped\\" proves that she is indeed \\"the little woman with the big voice\\".  She pours her heart and soul through every track.  Whenever you hear a song from this album on the radio, you MUST krank it up.  This will give you a much fuller depth into her heart.  The best track is \\"Beautiful\\", proving that you must love yourself regardless to what's outside.  Solely by hearing the tone of her voice on \\"I'm Okay\\", one can sense that she's still broken from witnessing her father's abusive ways.  Her much-loved sarcasm is expressed on the two \\"Stripped\\" interludes(Parts 1 & 2).  \\"Infatuation\\" returns her to her latin roots wonderfully!  <BR>Overall, her experimentation of different music genres(pop, R&B, rock, latin) proves that she is indeed the next Madonna and one step ahead of Aretha Franklin!  It's amazing that she can work with a broad range of artists...from Alicia Keys to Dave Navarro, and yet it blends with everything perfectly!  This album is a big step from her self-titled debut; therefore, I cannot wait to witness the next big step from \\"Stripped\\" to her next album!<BR>I will be very disappointed if she does not win any grammys for 2003!
B000002BQK|4.0|There's 5 good songs, the rest is weak, undesirable and un practiced songs that seem as though not thought out. This album is Not Mariah's best, but 2 of her top 10 best songs are on it, so it isn't bad, I'd give it a B+ because her voice is sensational though I prefer her new music any day.
B00008S2VG|5.0|Mirwais Armadzai was a great choice to help produce \\"American Life\\"!  He, as well as the fabulous Madonna, has a very creative outlook in music, which is expressed in this album.  The synthesizers and the guitar have a wonderful and unique blend.  Madonna has mastered the art of rap on tracks \\"American Life\\" and \\"Mother And Father\\".  She pours her out more than anything she's done in the past, besides \\"Ray of Light\\".  The single worthy \\"Nothing Fails\\" returns to her religious affiliations.  \\"Nobody Knows Me\\" and \\"Die Another Day\\" proves that Madonna has, in no question, become the best techno artist, not to mention dance in general.    <br />Do I smell a grammy nomination for Album of the Year?  I think so!
0553212621|5.0|D.H. Lawrence's most contraversial and classic book, an essential for anyone remotely interested in D.H. Lawrence and modern literature. It is, really, one of the first modern/contemporary novels, (along with Dostoevsky and Somerset Maughaum)although it still has a Victorian feel to it.<BR>  His book is almost prophetic, in a way. Lady launches the world into the likes of many modern writers (Henry Miller, Hemmingway, me). I'm not saying Hemmingway or Miller couldn't hold their own or write the way they did without Lawrence's influence. But, he did establish a less &quot;popper&quot; feel you get with Austen, the Brontes, Dickens, etc. Lady showed true equality and the absurdity of some traditions of class staus. <BR>  The only drawback with this novel, and other of Lawrence's books, is how similar the characters and language is in his books. In certain sections of his book(s) he'll overuse words. For example, in Lady and in The Rainbow, for about 50 pages he'll use &quot;acquiesense&quot; too much.<BR>  But never us mind that! His are excellent novels, beautiful, thoughtful, and sympathetic. Read it, you'll like it (unless you hate it).
B00004ZAV3|5.0|This CD consists only of every number one single the Beatles released.  While this music isn't all of a piece (&quot;Love Me Do&quot; and &quot;Let It Be&quot; are hardly similar), it does present the Beatles at their most commercial.  Not necessarily a bad thing, but it does end up giving an imperfect overview of the Beatles oeuvre (if that's indeed what you were looking for).<br />So, who's this CD for?<br />If you're looking to start adding the Beatles to your CD collection, I wouldn't suggest this one.  Chances are, you're going to end up buying several other CDs by them, and this disc will end up beng redundant.  Instead, you might want to try one of their full-length albums (maybe MEET THE BEATLES if you want an early one, RUBBER SOUL for a mid-period one, or ABBEY ROAD for a later one), or perhaps either the &quot;red&quot; or &quot;blue&quot; CD (1962-1966 and 1967-1970) if you're looking to sample.<br />If you don't plan on adding much Beatles to your collection, then by all means consider this one.  If your budget and CD rack could accomodate them, I'd again suggest the Red &amp; Blue discs (1962-1966 and 1967-1970).  That'll roughly triple the music you get from this single disc, and give you some tracks from albums (SGT PEPPER and THE WHITE ALBUM) that you won't get here.  But if you're only going to buy one Beatles album, and not listen to it all that often, this CD would make a fine choice.
B000059HB7|5.0|This is a great western.  If you like John Wayne you will love this movie.  This has John Wayne, Rickie Nelson, and Dean Martin - a great combination.  I have probably watched this about 15 - 25 times and I still like it.
6305718954|4.0|As a fan of religious horror films, this one is worthy of a purchase. <br />Although some of the storyline borrowed from previous horror films, such as The Exorcist, there was still enough new elements incorporated to keep us interested.  <br />It is very low on scare factor, but does deliver an intriguing and thought provoking way of looking at theology.
B00005JLRT|5.0|Star Trek: Nemesis is easily the darkest of all the Star Trek movies. It is also the quirkiest and the hardest-hitting of the Next Generation movies. The final ten minutes come like a machette attack and the entire movie wades in a dark, rich tone movie-goers last saw in the German Expressionist films of the 1920s. It's a very rare bird, and a delicious experience, completely unlike any other Star Trek movie and different indeed from any other science fiction movie altogether. Unjustly maligned upon its release, I hope that eventually Star Trek: Nemesis will find its audience. Unfortunately, since most Trekkies have seen the movie and disapproved of it this may never happen. Still, if you're a science fiction fan or love brilliant cinematography this film may find a very special place in your heart.

B000089A07|5.0|Everyone was wonderful in this movie!  We rented it not really knowing what to expect after having seen Silence of The Lambs and Hannibal.  This movie was a real murder mystery thriller with fantastic performances by everyone.  I thought it was well-cast.  Ed is perhaps better-known for playing the bad guy, but he pulls off this role and manages to make us believe he is fearful.  I personally believe Norton deserved an Oscar for his performances twice before.
B00005JLK1|2.0|After all the hype, this movie failed to live up to the scary expectations that were promised. <br />Although the acting was passable, the sets were remarkable, the lighting was effective, there was still a lot to be desired with this film. <br />The real highlight of the DVD came from all the extra's where we were given an inside look at the creation of the special effects as well as the film development.  <br />It doesn't have a decent shelf life that would command repeat viewings. Personally, this is one to rent before you buy it.

B00006CXXU|4.0|No matter what we think of Aguilera, she is one of those people we can't get enough of.  When I purchased this CD I was expecting the whole thing to be \\"Dirrty\\".  Boy was I wrong!  <br />The CD carefully takes the listener through many of her personal experiences, from being compared to Britney Spears to encouraging others to sing her song and keep moving on.  In between there was a fascinating variety of experiences and musical styles she handles with inredible ease:<br />WALK AWAY:  My lord but does she get passionate in this one!  She describes love like its a drug she knows she must get away from but can't.  In just one song her voice goes low--high and in between.  But she keeps it very sexy, very vulnerable.  This song is second in greatness to Houston's \\"I Will Always Love You\\" because only an expert can handle the skill it takes to sing \\"Walk Away\\"!<br />SOAR: Aguilera doesn't keep all the good learning to herself...here she encourages her listeners to not look outside oneself \\"for acceptance and approval\\", and tells them to \\"find a path that is your own\\".  A soul choir backs her up while she sings like she's in a Baptist Church on a sunny southern Sabbath!  <br />LOVING ME FOR ME was a song about her ex-boyfriend, the dancer that toured with her.  So was \\"Infatuation\\". She was so upset about singing these songs now that the man they were about had left her she didn't know how she would do it.  But courageously she sang them both.  This song also uses the theme of the CD (which is about her being stripped.)  In it she says her (ex) boyfriend loves her even when she's STRIPPED of all make up, she need not put up pretenses.  Lovely.  LOVING ME FOR ME is strikingly similar (perhaps purposely) to many of Mariah Carey's slow jams.<br />CRUZ (about cruising in her car while the sun and wind set her on a course to freedom) and BEAUTIFUL (self-explanatory) are reminiscent of 1960's music and in fact made me wonder if they were remakes.  Nothing sexual in either one.And very classy.<br />DIRRTY:  I think the title says it all.  It's all fun and naugtiness.  Love it.<br />Some of the songs in this CD were weird, but the ones I just described for you should are fabulous, some of them should be kept in the files of all easy-listening stations.  It's so good to see her bare her soul this courageously, to see her \\"stripped\\" of everything the industry had tried to fashion her into.
B00008V2VM|5.0|this movie for not acting in the typical vein of a horrible hollywood action flick.<br />you know, there are actors (and actresses) like christian bale, emily watson, and taye diggs that always try to get involved with the best films (we can forgive taye for brown sugar, he of course has to pay his bills as well). the computer animation of the \\"metropolis\\" like city is quite nice... the cinemaphotography, plot, and setting are all very well done. the setting i think was done quite nicely.<br />i mean, when the scene comes down when christian is going to fight taye you think they are going to get into this huge fight... but he (christian/preston) just slices him into three peices. i just love that sort of thing... i'd rather see him cut him into three peices with one swift move than the typical ten minute hollywood fight where each one has the other at one anothers mercy about four different times and fails to kill the other. <br />take the concepts of gattaca, fairenheit451, the matrix, and dark city and you have this movie... and i know, for most people that would sound like a bad thing... but here it works quite well.<br />and if that doesn't intrigue you the action scenes are still pretty cool... but keep in mind that christian (preston) doesn't even come close to losing a fight even once... and sometimes his victims look like crash test dummys :P
B000003TAR|5.0|Okay, I should be fair and tell all what I feel the 1st best introspective album is since I said this is 2nd. John Lennon's \\"Plastic Ono Band\\" is #1 and this is #2. I know, that will get the old-timers in a fury to think Nirvana could be behind Jonn Lennon but this album is brilliant.I respect opinions greatly but to see 1 and 2 star ratings for this album is mind boggling. My biggest thing I love about Nirvana is that they CRUSHED the likes of POISON and those other crap bubble gum metal acts. Some people must want lyrics and meanings handed on a plate to them but Kobain was in a world of his own lyrically and one of a kind. I remember the day it came out and when I finished listening to it, thought, this is the epitome of the HARD sound I always wanted. MILK IT is my anthem when it comes down to pounding depth in all extremes. Pennyroyal Tea brings chills to me and is one of the best Nirvana songs.  If you love lyrics like baby baby and let's party, I respect you not liking this but to all true music fans that understand all forms of music, we all know that this is one of the greatest albums ever.
0385504209|5.0|This book is an incredible work of fiction that not only entertains based on its own merits, but also makes you fight not to go find the art works and check things out for yourself! This was a book that I simply could not put down once I started.  I'll be checking out  Brown's other books now too.
0749336021|5.0|The Joy Luck Club is a creative and unique novel that entwines the lives of four Chinese mothers and their daughters. Although, it is an engaging book, it is often times easy to become confused as you lose which daughter goes with what mother. Other than that though, it is interesting and true to life. It tells the story of the struggles mothers and daughters often have. The mothers and daughters experience hate, happiness, and despair. Many of these stories also deal with Chinese customs.<br />I completely enjoyed the book.
B00005JLF5|5.0|A pretty good Sci Fi series with action romance and danger. This show is pretty good.
B00005QZ7U|1.0|Complete waste of money and time. I can only laugh when I think of this piece of trash. Those who enjoyed this piece of dung need to get a life.
B000001Y2U|4.0|I always knew Manson as the guy who removed his own ribs for personal reasons and warmed up to security guards (Rumours!)I never knew his music was awesome.There are a lot of good tracks on here.A few Standouts are The Beautiful People, Tourniquet, Angel with the scabbed wings and 1996.To tell the truth I only bought this cuz he was on Ozzfest 03 but Now I am currently in the process of buying all his stuff.Good Album. 99 tracks. Reccommended.
0385507755|5.0|A Million Little Pieces explores James' time in a rehabilitation center and his fight back to sobriety.  His story is simultaneously heartbreaking and maddening.  A child of a very privileged upbringing, James drinks, takes drugs, destroys people and things with little remorse.  At the age of 23, after hitting bottom by seriously injuring himself during a blackout, his parents pay his way into an expensive rehabilitation center.<br />At the rehabiliation center, James meets people with all different types of lives--ex-con's, prostitutes, poor people, very rich people, people who have given up on themselves, and people who are just hanging on.  Still retaining his stubborness, James rejects the center's reliance on AA and the 12-steps, and commits to changing his life by the sheer strength of his own will.<br />There are moments in this book that are heartbreaking--the first 100 pages brought tears to my eyes twice.  Even if you don't have empathy for James and his situation, the description of his dental surgery without any medication drags you into James' soul and creates great respect for what ordinary people do--the dentist--to help others.<br />This book was hard to put down, you can't help wanting everyone at the center to get their lives back, even though you know chances are good they will not.  At times, the reading is difficult.  Bad things happen to \\"good\\" people and \\"bad\\" people, and everyone is simply trying to make their way through the world.  Merely  human, James is simultaneously strong and fragile and so is his reader.
B00005JKHN|5.0|This beautiful 2 disc DVD was released here in the UK some months ago and it does full justice to one of Walt Disney's greatest achievements. I'ts terrific to be able to see the full Widescreen image again, after all these years - and the sound is absolutely breathtaking. <BR>Apart from the main feature, there are many, many great extras, not least of which is Disney's fabulous CinemaScope featurette \\"Grand Canyon\\" - again, with breathtaking sound.<br />I remember seeing this as the support to \\"Sleeping Beauty\\" on it's original Road Show release and it's just wonderful to be able to catch up with this lost masterpiece again.<br />The people who put this package together have done a great job - don't miss it when it comes your way.
B00005JL2O|3.0|The First Austin Powers with never lose it's magic.  I could watch it a hundred times and I will always laugh.  This movie doesn't have that.  Too much repeats of the jokes.  The whole \\"shhh\\" thing has gotten to become retarded.  Too little effort to make this any better than the original.
B0000042H4|1.0|The microphones were placed right if front of the singers. In Wagner, the orchestra has to at least challenge the singers. But not here.<BR>The atmostphere is not here. The balance of the instruments is pathetic.<BR>Nilsson is great, but sharp at many moments. The other singers all inferior to her.<BR>The \\"Ride\\" is the worst ever recorded. Echo, echo, echo.<BR>I can't recommend this
B000056K04|3.0|Don't get me wrong, I'm a huge DMB fan, but this album was made specifically for MTV fans.  the band trashed the lillywhite sessions and released this album with a pop sound.  If you enjoy the early dave, this is not for you.
B0000041Q3|5.0|I only own this Turandot. Yet I've listen to the other versions by borrowing from my opera singer friend. I think this one is by far the best.<BR>I love the three principle, especially Joan Sutherland. Her voice is just so rich and creamy and her intonation so perfect. Close to her is Caballe who offers incredible pianissimo high notes. The big P is always a joy to hear and there is no exception here. Only thing, his Nessun Dorma is a little small sounding. And I wish he would hold that high B a bit longer.<BR>Other than that, this one is unbeatable. I don't like Birgit Nilsson's voice and Eva Marton. So obviously I won't recommend them. Unless you like voices with no variations of colors. I don't care how big their voices are. There's no beauty in the tone. AT least, to me.<BR>I never heard Sutherland sang Turandot, so I don't know if she would be able to do it live. But so what? This recording is extremely well made to make all the singers sound gorgeous.<BR>A ten score in my book for this Puccini masterpiece. Honestly, I believe this is what Puccini would have wanted Turandot to be sung and conducted.
B00008PX8P|5.0|This DVD is mindblowing how good it is.  Its packed with Live songs from differents shows and interviews.  A Must buy for any Zeppelin or even any music fan by that.
B000001Y5D|5.0|This was possibly one of the best groups to play in the 90s.  Unfortunately, they broke up before they produce their second album.  If only they would magically appear on stage again, I'm sure that the world would accept them back in the spotlight of the music industry.  Maybe we'll all be blessed that one day they will get back together again and grace our ears with their music.
B00008PW3Q|5.0|Fleetwood Mac is back, albeit without Christi but, they sound fabuolous.  Thrown Down is magical.  it still resonates in my soul days after i first heard it.  Lindsay's souls-stirring guitar pluckings are some of the best that Rock and Roll and the World has ever heard.  Paul Simon said it, &quot;Where have you gone Joe Dimaggio, a nation turns its lonely eyes to you&quot;.  well, i say, &quot;Where had you been Lindsay Buckingham, a nation turns its lonely ears to you&quot;.  Anyone who has ever heard Rhiannon and the sweet, soul tickling guitar fill ins by Lindsay knows what i mean.  Long live Fleetwood Mac.  Some good things never go away.
B00005YW4H|5.0|I first heard Norah Jones while sitting in San Diego.  I was with a new friend and he said that I had to listen to this artist that he had found. He played a few of her songs on his laptop and when the first song finished. I was already asking him to play more of her songs on the cd. She put me in complete awe!!  I can not believe that she has only one album!!  I think that the way the music moves with her soft, jazzy voice is dangereous!  As soon as I put her cd in to play, I have already lost the cares beyond me &amp; my cd player. I can see myself on the beach with not a care in the world. I feel totally content &amp; there isn't any other people besides me &amp; Norah. I could go on &amp; on with a variety of words to describe her style &amp; talent. The best I can say is that she is Perfect.  Unlike any other cd that I have purchased in the past, I like...even better love, every track on the album. I listen to Norah when I need to relax, when I need sleep, while I am  sitting  on my porch with a glass of lemonade feeling the summer breeze. Or if you just yearn to feel nothing more than peaceful &amp; passionate. MY favorite way to listen to Norah is lying on a San Diego beach with the warm sun warming my face, the cool breeze making me comfortable. Norah's entrance is a welcomed invitation for her to make everything just... PERFECT!!
B000002JSN|5.0|you can't go wrong with any of zepp's first six albums, ending with this one in 1975. physical graffiti showcased zepp at the height of their popularity. never again would they produce a consistent album from beginning to end. this album is what got me into music as a teenager, and represents my favorite rock album of all-time. the second cut, \\"the rover\\", has got to be their most under-rated song in their entire catalogue. talk about raunchy, down-dirty rock? play this one as loud as you can! nice slide guitar by page on \\"in my time of dying\\". check out plant's singing on \\"night flight\\". he sings at such a high pitch and with a very powerful delivery. other highlights include page and his use of dubbing guitars on \\"ten years gone\\", the middle eastern flavor of the popular fm hit \\"kashmir\\", the beautiful short instrumental by page on \\"bron-yr-aur\\", and their telling of life on the road with \\"sick again\\". they had a lot of material to choose from during this period, including leftover material from the \\"houses of the holy\\" album two years earlier. the song of the same title being a prime example, oddly enough ending up on \\"physical graffiti\\" instead. some people feel this album is a little uneven and it is mainly because all the material did not come from one session but from a three year period from 1973-75. i happen to love it for that reason because it shows the diversity this group had and you can hear the various influences in their songs. there are a few tracks that have not yet been killed by fm radio, making it more refreshing to listen too. most of zepp I, II, IV, and houses of the holy have been beaten to death on the airwaves, another reason i like this one the best.
B00008H2LB|5.0|Alright so I give in. I am now officially a Linkin Park fan. And contrary to popular belief these days, no am I not a twelve year old girl who thinks Mike/Chester/Brad/Phoenix/Joe/Rob is 'hot'. My journey towards Linkin Park fandom started not with Hybrid Theory but with 'Reanimation'. Having been blown away by such an innovative CD, I picked up Hybrid Theory and thoroughly enjoyed that. Which brings me quite nicely to 'Meteora'.<br />At 37 minutes long, one can complain that the record is too short. You won't find me complaining. 'Meteora' is 37 minutes of the most intricate and imaginative music you're likely to hear this year. What stuns me about 'Meteora' is just how rich in depth it is despite it's short length. The subtle nuances in each song that make every listen different from the last. It's been in my CD player for the last month now and still I hear different things in different places in different songs that I hadn't heard before. <br />The best thing I can say about this CD is it's inherent seamlessness, not one song feels out of place or disjointed. Instead the songs flow so naturally and effortlessly into each other, combining sounds and elements that coming from any other band would be at best awkward and at worst disastrous. But Linkin Park pull it off spectacularly. I can't pick a favourite song, simply because I can't make up my mind. This week I'm stoked on 'Breaking the Habit', last week it was 'Don't Stay' and the week before that was 'Nobody's Listening'. Next week it'll probably be something else. <br />If you insist on defining music into genres like rap/rock and nu-metal, and you think Linkin Park is too 'pop' or 'not metal enough' instead of just appreciating the music for the remarkable innovation that it is , then this CD is not for you. And more's the pity because this, in my opinion, is quite simply the stand-out album of the year.
B000089RVX|5.0|This album is great. Amy Lee's vocals are hypnotic. Better yet simply amazing. I can't wait to hear future albums from this band. Definately check out this album.
B00005JLRT|5.0|Not unlike many Star Trek fans, when I went and saw Star Trek Nemesis at the theater the first time, I was a little blanched by it because it seemed to be a disappointment based on four years of anticipation and all the hype leading up to its release.  Upon a second viewing at the theater a couple weeks thereafter I warmed up to this tale a little more.  And now we finally have the DVD where a third viewing for me has clinched this as one of the better Star Trek movies.  Paramount has finally decided to not put the screws to us once again by releasing a DVD with just the movie and a trailer; they have loaded this one down with as much as possible.<br />Many fans have made reference to the writer John Logan who wrote \\"Gladiator\\" and someone who has been a long time fan of Star Trek that he embedded this film with way too many references to previously filmed scenes.  While this may be the case, I do not think it detracts from the film in any way.  Overall, I believe John Logan, Rick Berman and Brent Spiner who are all credited with writing this trek tale, did a wonderful job of dealing with the particular issues that they wanted included and tossing in some of the best Star Trek silver screen space battles ever done.<br />Credits to of course the entire Star Trek The Next Generation's cast for their usual high standard performances and to Tom Hardy for his wonderful performance as Shinzon of Remus.  We're even treated to a guest performance by none other than Kate Mulgrew as \\"Admiral\\" Janeway, which leaves many a Star Trek fan to wonder where Voyager will lead to in the future...<br />The premise:<br />Going into this film, the Executive Producer of Star Trek Rick Berman knew there were particular aspects that they had to include in this film as part of the premise that this would be \\"A Generation's Final Journey,\\" which they did quite well to include leaving a huge possibility at the end of the film for this to \\"not\\" be STNG's final journey on the silver screen.<br />Shinzon of Remus, The Romulan Empires second and closest planet has managed to overthrow the Romulan Senate to include the Praetor and is now its Praetor.  Having ties with Captain Jean Luc Picard and a need to meet him, he sets into motion a plan that will draw the Federations flagship and her Captain to Romulus for a fateful meeting that will possibly herald the destruction of Earth and the Federation.<br />The DVD:<br />As referenced above, Paramount really outdid themselves with this particular release.  In past Star Trek film DVD releases we've received only the film and a trailer or two and for the past year or so they've finally been re-releasing the films as \\"Special Editions.\\"<br />The cover art for the DVD is perfect.  In addition to the wonderful cover art the DVD case itself is new and different as well, with two clips for keeping the case closed which is fairly innovative!<br />The on screen menus for this DVD are nothing short of spectacular and probably the best I've seen so far for a Star Trek DVD.<br />Special Features:<br />Commentary by Director Stuart Baird<BR>Exclusive Documentaries:<BR> - New Frontiers:  Stuart Baird on Directing \\"Nemesis\\"<BR> - A Bold Vision of the Final Frontier<BR> - A Star Trek Family's Final Journey<BR> - Red Alert!  Shooting the Action of \\"Nemesis\\"<BR>Deleted Scenes<BR>Photo Gallery<BR>Previews - The wonderful preview for the release of all seven seasons of DS9 on DVD.<br />I highly recommend this DVD to all fans, hard core or casual and that they give this film a second look as it truly is a wonderful addition to the Star Trek film library!  {ssintrepid}

B00005JLWN|4.0|This movie features not only the most impressive gunfight sequences in recent movie history but also some very stylish swordfighting scenes. An outstanding performance by Christian Bale (American Psycho, Reign of Fire) made it all the more enjoyable. His convincing portrayal of the highest ranking Grammaton Cleric, an unfeeling, unemotional, near superhuman killing machine, draws you into the post-apocalyptic, prozac nation of Libria very quickly.<br />Initially, the set designs took me aback; it wasn't as polished as the costume designs but that's quite understandable given the movie's budget. It's definitely no Minority Report nor The Matrix in terms of production quality but it succeeds in bringing its own memorable flavor. Despite the premise and some pretty weak moments along the way, I found myself being entertained by this little gem of a sci-fi action flick. Don't miss it!
B000002KLP|4.0|After the sucess of his self-titled second album he went to a studio and recorded demo tapes for perhaps upcomming albums. The executive of Warner Brothers listened to it and Prince wanted to know his opinion. He told Prince to release to released them like they are. Prince released the LP with these songs on and the album title Dirty Mind. Dirty Mind was not as succesful as it´s predecessor however was hailed by critics and is considered by many Prince´s first materpiece. <br />By most of Prince hardcore fans this album is often mentioned as one of his strongest and no arguing about that. This is a kick ... album. All the songs are amazingly written and produced. It is funky,poppish and a bit humorous. The lyrics are often profound and perhaps may offend certain listeners. <br />Although Dirty Mind is a great album it may not appeal to all listeners but hey what Prince album appeals to everybody but if you wan´t to hear an album that perhaps influenced a handful of artists ( for example Madonna) and still stands a test of it´s time even after more than 22 years after go for it. <br />But why the 4 stars. Well although the music is 4.75 the quality of this cd is bad. I hope Prince makes piece with Warner Brothers and they together release these albums digitally remastered because it definately needs it. But that aside this album is perfect.
B000000JO3|5.0|A collection of their five recordings from 1980-1983, this anthology chronicals the complete history of Washington DC's Minor Threat. Released in 1989, six years after their disbandment, the album gives a look into the band, who are most famous for starting the sXe (straight edge) movement of punks who refuse to drink, do drugs, or have casual sex. They're also famous because of frontman Ian MacKaye, who would eventually go on to form the emu band Fugazi. <br />From the first song \\"Filler\\", which is one of the hardest songs on the record, to the final song \\"Salad Days\\", it runs through songs of short (Straight Edge clocks in at only 45 seconds)to longer ones (Look Back and Laugh hits at almost 4 minutes) and also with covers of Wire's \\"12XU\\" and The Monkees' \\"Stepping Stone\\".<br />All in all, this album is a classic showcase of the 1980s punk/hardcore scene. A must for any punk fan.
B00005QGAZ|3.0|Released in december 1982. Thriller became one of the most hyped album ever made and it was a massive hit 1983 and 1984. by the end of 1984 two years after its release Thriller had sold astonish 20 million copies in the US alone and another 15 million copies outside the US. Thriller has sold 51 million copies to date and is the biggest selling album in history ( worldwide). <br />Thriller has one of the greatest pop songs ever created such as Billie Jean, Thriller, I Wanna be startin something, Beat It and Human Nature. Quincy Jones was a hot producer and everything he did was gold. Michael himself believe it or not only wrote 4 songs on this album although 2 of those songs were the albums biggest hits. <br />But why the 3 stars. There some tracks on this album. P.Y.T. , The Girl is mine and Baby Be Mine that are not near as good as the other tracks on the album. The songs are a bit silly and cheesy and in my humble opinion fillers. I do not care if they were hit singels. <br />Vocally this album isn´t amazing. Michael Jackson has is not exactly the greatest vocalist ever but not bad either. I would also like to say that Thriller has not aged well and If you look at all Jacko´s releases none of them haven´t aged very well. It is a bit shame because this album has some brilliant songs on it and the videos that came a long with it rocked however Thriller only gets 3 stars here because there were some songs better than others and it is a bit dated however. A good album but not great
B000026C3T|5.0|First - music is offcourse five stars.<BR>But the point is that there can't be good Led Zeppelin 'best of', 'best of early/later days' or whatsoever, because every compilation would miss some/other great tracks, and in case of Zeppelin, you are not allowed to miss anything!<BR>Ok, if you are new, sets like this are great introduction, but if you dig it, or any classic rock, all Led Zeppelin album are obligatory! Esspetially first six of them.<BR>Still, great songlist,and if you won't go further, essential by any means.
B00008S2VG|2.0|Music was a fair album. This one is that too but it is worse. Musically it is allright but she is actually doing the same thing she did on her previous release. But unlike Music this one has not one really good song on it. All the tracks are boring. Lyrically childish and vocally this is Madonna´s worst LP. What happened to Madonna. Over the past two years she has been making such a fool out of herslef. <br />First she goes on the road with the dreadful drowned World tour that people paid 250 dollars to see. Next she acts in her husbands film Swept Away which just flopped at the box-office and was also panned by the critics. She made commends about a woman who breastfed her 8 year old kid and said that this woman has no morals and people do everything for ratings. Pleeaaaaasssseee says who ( Mtv video awards, blonde abition scandal, Truth or dare movie, the sex book, Body Of Evidence) Come on Madonna. And Hey wasn´t Madonna saying that hypocrisy worst thing in life not sex. Well Madonna is one of the biggest hypocrites in the music industry right now. Then she released this sad excuse for an album. What has happened to her. I used to like her but now I don´t know. She perhaps should have skipped acting in Swept Away and consetrate on making a good album instead she made a bad movie that gave her numerous razzies and released a bad album.<br />This album is not very good and she needs to find good songwriters and producers to work with her next time around. Perhaps you should hire Patrick Leonard even though you don´t work with the same people more than twice ( which is by the way a huge lie. She worked with Patric and Steve Bray more than twice). Sorry Madonna I am not feeling this album maybe next time or perhaps you should retire.
B00008AY3L|5.0|Here's how it breaks down.  Pop in this beautiful disc.  The bright lights swirl around in your player and feel the sensation of some of the most engaging music ever.  Just listen and feel it, and don't even try to critique it.  For it needs no critiquing,  it only is the best sound ever,  for in it lies it's own identity.
B00005JLRT|4.0|This film had lots of what makes a good movie. Emotion, special effects, and a decent storyline.<br />It was nice to see all the cast together for (at least) one last romp through the galaxy, even though one member doesn't come home.<br />There was lots of emotion in this film as we dealt with some issues that haven't ever been addressed in the next generation 'universe'. The characters grapple with change, and moving on with grace and dignity.<br />The special edition DVD contains deleted scenes which really showed this side of the film, it's a shame they were deleted at all. I think this would have made for a much better theatrical release.<br />The special effects shots were awe-inspiring, with the space battle a great workout for the home theatre. I had one bad thing to say about the space battle that seems to be a recurring theme in the star trek movies. Why do they always get their butts kicked and have to rebuild the ship every single time? I guess they think that we can't have good conflict unless we see lots of sparks and chunks of titanium being blasted off the ship and then floating around in space. Of course, the battle sequence is phenomenal, but I just kept asking myself that question.<br />To sum up, this is probably the best next gen film yet. I hope they make a 'transition' film that includes members from casts of next gen as well as Voyager, and maybe even DS9. It's possible that they could even include some of Archer's crew from Enterprise as well, especially since their main foe are timetravellers!
B00003CXBK|5.0|I think many people have misread the theme of this movie- obviously there is the evil of man in the iron industry, but there is also the evil of nature, as evidenced by the gods of the forest who let their hate for mankind consume them. This is why I love this movie- it is not the traditional American hippie-nature-is-always-good, nor is it trample across the forest. BOTH mankind and nature have lost their way, and the main character, a sort of dark, brooding, savior of sorts comes to tell them that both of them are wrong and if they continue on their path both of them will be destroyed. That's at least what I got out of the movie. I think the visuals are stunning and serve to emphasize the story and theme, and the violence has a purpose for being in the movie, and could not be called gratuitous by anyone's measure. I love this movie because it is quite different from most of the anime that seems to make its way to American shores. I don't know if they're keeping all the best stuff in Japan, but some of the stuff I see is no better than our own American animation in terms of content and execution. Then of course, are the rare gems such as this. Miyazaki is a genius, the equivalent of George Lucas (before the prequels), Steven Spielberg, and Walt Disney (the man, not the company), all rolled into one, with a vision and craft that transcends them all. Magnificent.<br />Billy Bob Thorton had no reason to be cast for this movie- bad decision, but I won't let it mar my love of the underlying movie.
B00003CXWV|5.0|This film once again proves that johnny depp is a friggin' awesome actor. Even though he plays one of the worst drug dealers ever, you still feel sorry for his character. Supporting acting is good, but his mother is annoying. Last, but not least, the soundtrack kicks ass. The Stones,and various other bitchin' songs. To sum it all up: friggin' amazing, it really got me interested in the real george jung and cocaine smuggling from columbia to the US. <BR>PS- depp's sunglasses are bitchin'!!!!
B000089RVX|2.0|Dont get me wrong, Evanescence is a good band, they just need to make better songs...Going under, tourniquet, and haunted are the only songs that interested me. I'd like it to be a little bit louder but thats just me and im a Marilyn Manson fan. But my friends loved it.
0792833201|3.0|I don't know about you, but I seek for some degree of realism in the movies I watch. Realism becomes even more crucial if horror movies are at stake; because nobody can get engaged with phony horror scenes. I constantly watch horror movies, and bought 'Poltergeist' on an occasion, with great expectations, since it was directed by Spielberg. But I am very disappointed with the production, as it stands out as a black mark among Spielberg's great works. Why?<br />The whole notion of becoming one with television, receiving messages from 'them', talking to 'them', and  then after all scaring people by some strange forces is totally meaningless. The use of little children with blank faces is effective in that it exploits strange feelings inside us. However, I do not think that the little girl in this movie succeeds in that. Special forces, moving chairs, sudden tornados are all a part of this movie. <br />I believe that Spielberg had done a far better job with his Jaws series. And believe it or not, I felt more tension when I was watching those, and not 'Poltergeist'. If you like to see things that do not occur in the normal life, than please go on, and see 'Poltergesit', for you will not be disappointed.
B00004XPPE|2.0|This film is interesting only in the fact that it is an odd relic of anti-Cold War propaganda; a pacifist film touting a suicidal philosophy of disarmament. Its particularly ironic that the smugness of the film's creators is now quite laughable in the hindsight of history. Despite all the dire predictions this film makes, thirty years later the U.S. would ultimately win the Cold War against the Soviet Union... and without a nuclear shot being fired in anger.
B00006FDCD|3.0|There was no further suspense when I was reading Stephen King's 'It'. I was thrilled to death, as I turned each page over. 'It' and again King's 'Pet Cemetery' were the novels of my childhood. I believe these are the few books of King's, where children and teenagers are the characters. Anyway, seeing 'It' sounded great as my expectation was naturally high. But, after I watched the DVD, I realised that watching this movie altered the enchanting effect of the book in my mind.<br />A distinction between written and visual art should be made. When we read books, especially fiction books, we create images of the characters in our minds. Interestingly enough, no matter how clear and precise can an author's descriptions be, we all form different images. I believe, that was the case, when I watched the movie. The image of the clown in the movie did not reach to my expectations, because as I read the novel I had thought of the clown as the ultimate figure of terror.<br />The book is a must-be-read book. 'It' is excellent; in my view, the best work of Stephen King. Unfortunately, I cannot say the same things for the movie.
0804115613|5.0|This book is about so many things:  the meaning of a family unit, breaking tradition, homosexuality, racism, domestic abuse, overcoming adversity... But it is mainly about goodness.  Good people, good times, and good humor.  And there are not a lot of books like this.  It is a feel good book, without ever being sappy or predictable.  I fell in love with the characters, especially the relationship between Ruth and Idgie.  And the fact that it spans so many years, moving so seamlesssly throughout their lives, made it extra delicious for the adult mind. There is always magic when you have an older wiser woman looking back on the years, as in the case of this story.
B000000WA4|5.0|This album is everything. Yes, everything, it has everything, from soft, calm, instrumentals like the title track to hard, gothic-industial crunch of X.Y.U. This album is only a bit less amazing than what is the greatest alt-rock album ever, the Pumpkin's Siamese Dream.<br />It's long, and bloated, with 28 songs, over 2 hours long, but it is still just amazing to hear. It has more of a metal edge than Siamese Dream, and focuses more on vocals, while Siamese Dream's beauty lies both equally in the vocals and guitars, though MCIS does not have poor guitars, they aren't as creative or beautiful as the groundbreaking Siamese Dream.<br />Still, this spectacular album deserves 5 stars.
B00006CXXU|1.0|You're not beautiful, no matter what they say.  Words will bring you down.
B000000WJZ|5.0|This album is amazing. Every single song is spectacular.  Even the guitar and drums ooze with as much emotion as Billy Corgan's unique, love-it-or-hate-it vocals and deep, meaningful lyrics, From the rock n' roll beauty of &quot;Cherub Rock&quot;, the hidden sadness of &quot;Today&quot;, to the spectacular ending of &quot;Rocket&quot;, the depression and beauty of &quot;Disarm&quot;, the soft to hard masterpiece &quot;Soma&quot;, the kickass solo of &quot;Geek USA&quot; (Soma also has an equally amazing solo), the angsty grunge-esque ness of the amazingly beautiful &quot;Mayonaise&quot;, the hard-rockin'ness of &quot;SilverFOCK&quot;, and beautiful &quot;Luna&quot;, the album is timeless and perfect. I don't usually give out 5's, but if any album deserves a 5, it's Billy Corgan's masterpiece, Siamese Dream.
B000089RVX|5.0|Let's talk about the album! First and foremost, the people involved in making this album are very creative and really into their art and it shows. With eleven songs in the album and approximately 45 minutes of music, makes up quite a short album. Though the strength is not in its length, you notice that all the pieces are powerful. Beginning with Going Under, the album starts off heavy, very melodic and thrashing. No speed or extra creative solos in the music department, but in the end, no one seems to be doing that anymore. The riffs are compact to the point and make their presence in all the songs. More so, in Bring me to Life and Tourniquet. What's creative in the music foray is the fact that though the album is rich with guitars, bass and drums, in the background, you can't miss the orchestral strings on some of the songs. That just enhances the musical display up a notch and this one works very much like Metallica's Nothing Else Matters. The treat comes in the form of two songs that are absolutely devoid of guitars. Piano is featured and Amy Lee's vocals transcends. That eclectic mix is not something to think lightly, especially with a new band releasing their first label album. Add to the fact that the band's name raises eyebrows, just goes to show you that these guys will try to capture you with their art, rather than looks.<br />Amy Lee!!! With a haunting voice echoing on all of the bands songs, you can tell that this woman means what she's saying. Her voice when listened with ear phones just goes deep inside you, touching your soul. It's soothing, at times, haunting, more than ever, and mystic throughout. Her vocal talents are a can't miss in all the songs, but makes it's presence felt in \\"My Immortal\\". She doesn't speak out the lyrics, she sings them. She makes the words music to the ears.<br />An excellent debut album! Highly recommended for the layman and the head banging junkie out there (if there are any these days that is).
B00005JM03|4.0|I enjoyed this, but not as much as I enjoyed the original.  I don't think it can be the real Italian Job without Michael Caine saying, \\"I told you to only blow the bloody doors off.\\"  Even without Michael Caine I think this movie was quite enjoyable and worth seeing, although I highly recommend seeing the original either before or after you see this movie.
B00000ILBK|1.0|Star Trek could have used a hit movie when this was released, unfortuantely we got Insurrection.<br />I'm happy to see the TNG cast whenever I can, and it was nice to see them in the movie but that's all the enjoyment I got-seeing the cast.<br />The movie itself suffered from a poor story. I found the movie very slow, I had little sympathy for the people Picard was trying to save, nor was I impressed with the villian.<br />I originally saw this movie in the theatre and left unhappy, I bought the video and watched half of it and then shut it off.  I've never watched it since.  Buy it if you want to complete your TNG collection, otherwise I can not recommend this film.
B00008AOS5|4.0|For me Silence of the Lambs was one of the more overrated movies that i have ever seen, it wasnt bad but i didnt get why it was praised so highly, it was just average.  Then Hannibal came out which...well basically hannibal [wsn't good].  <br />Now i almost passed on seeing red dragon because generally prequils kinda [not good] but this one was great, surpassing silence and hannibal.  The first ten minutes of it our great, the look on nortons face when he finds out hannibal is the killer was just classic.  The story of Red Dragon is of course similar to silence of the lambs, the investigator enlists the help of hannibal in catching a killer.  Feinnes does a great job in his role, i mean you want him to get caught but you also sorta feel sorry for him as well.  Edward Norton is good as always but seemes a bit miscast in this role...i guess once youve seen american history X every other character he plays just doesnt seem right.  <br />In any event, if your a big fan of the trilogy or just want a good movie you cant go wrong with Red Dragon.
B00008RH3L|5.0|Undoubtedly, MILLERS CROSSING is the finest film to date by Joel and Ethan Coen.  This is not your run-of-the mill gangster film.  On the contrary, this is the Coen brothes take on the gangster epic.  Therefore, in the film is found all the signature trademarks of their work: dark humor, complex characters, clever and thoughtful plot twists, and an all-around, damn good-looking movie.  As always, the Coen brothers succeed in creating an amazing atmosphere for their characters to run amouck in.<br />As is the case with all their films, they assemble a cast of actors that is both unconventional and brilliant.  Gabriel Byrne (in what has to be the finest performance of his career) is the unlikely protagonist, Tom- a sort of boozing, sulking gangster who plays all sides and confuses one and all (including the viewer).  Marcia Gay Harden is both funny and sultry as the tough moll that pits two friends against one another.  Albert Finney, in an excellent performance, plays the other side of the love triangle.  John Turturro, Jon Polito and Steve Buscemi provide terrific support.<br />Special mention must be made to the hauntingly beautiful score by Carter Burwell, which perfectly adds to the dark and eery world that these people inhabit.<br />I hadn't seen this movie in years until I picked up the DVD this past week.  Seeing it again, finally on DVD, was just as moving and effective as I remembered (probably even moreso!).  MILLERS CROSSING, finally out on DVD, was well worth the wait!
B00006F83Y|4.0|&quot;Rock has returned!&quot; That's what thousands of Queens of the Stone Age fans are saying. While I am definently glad that Queens is here, I am also surprised that &quot;Songs for the Deaf&quot; has recieved so much credit, because frankly, it is a very overrated album. But there is no doubt about it; Queens is a great band, and I have great respect for them and in times like these, Queens gives me a bit of relief. However, I truly wished they put out a better album then this, because they really do have the potential for a 5 star album. Considering everyone is looking toward them to bring back the rock, they could of done better then this. The songs &quot;Hanging Tree&quot; and &quot;Song for the Dead&quot; are fine examples of Queens at their best. I wish I could see more of that here, but unfortunately, many of these tracks are snoozers. I may sound negative, but do not get me wrong, this is a fine album; one of the best this year. Any rock fan should give it a listen. Lets just hope that next time, Queens puts out that 5 star album that they have the potential for. Thumbs up.
B000002H33|5.0|i love this cd, you should definitely buy it. it has some of their best stuff, like sanitarium, master of puppets, orion, and the thing that should not be. dont get me wrong, though-every song is good. plus, it was the last one with cliff burton. anyway, buy it, and you will not be dissapointed.
0790731002|5.0|Call me a bozo for writing a favorable review for this movie but I have to say that the third installment in the Batman movie series is a great follow-up to the wicked \\"Batman\\" & \\"Batmen Returns\\" movies and I have to say that \\"Batman Forever\\" is a misleading title for the movie. While it's an absolutely great movie, \\"Batman Forever\\" is sadly the last great movie in the series. The following one two years later was a burning wreckage salvaged only by some cool action sequences but otherwise, it sadly destroyed the franchise and made our beloved comic hero into the laughing stock of the world. Even to this day, I still am baffled how Schumacher managed to successfully create and direct this third Batman movie and make it an awesome popcorn flick and completely ruin the entire saga with the disastrous follow-up that came two years later after this one. <br />This third addition to the franchise brings the movie series into a far less bleak arena and into a brighter and more colorful direction with the Gotham City hero being brought up against the menacing villain Two-Face, a former attorney who was driven mad after a series of injuries after an accident. The Dark Knight is also going head to head against another villain, a highly crazed and eccentric scientist named Edward Nigma also known as The Riddler. The two villains team up and plan to use a special invention that Nigma had built to hypnotize the minds of Gotham City's population and power his machine to where it can hypnotize the entire world and bring out their deepest secrets and the two use the machine to take over the world and now Batman, played by Val Kilmer teams up with Dick Grayson, who decides to join the hero business to seek revenge on Two Face after he caused the deaths of his parents and brother. Bruce Wayne also is the romantic interest of a psychologist named Dr. Chase Meridian who's also bent on trying to see what makes Wayne tick. <br />The special effects are really awesome not so overdone. Although a lot campier than the two before it, this movie wonderfully balances the comedy of the 60s series yet maintains plenty of the spirits of the darker predecessor. Jim Carrey, while not necessarily at his best, puts out an awesome performance as the highly eccentric and villainous The Riddler. The blender like device of his was pretty cool as well. Tommy Lee Jones wasn't too bad either as Two-Face. The odd make up though was overdone in my opinion and looked more like a Halloween mask than actual scars. These two colorful criminal menaces make quite a hell of a comedic criminal duo and it's really a laugh with the shenanigans from Riddler and Two-Face. To me, there was a lot of chemistry between the actors and actresses involved in this movie where it was all fake and completely contrived on \\"Batman & Robin\\". I'll admit that no one in my opinion can play Mr. Wayne better than Michael Keaton did in the first two in the series but Val Kilmer in \\"Batman Forever\\" was in my opinion, very good and did a great job playing Bruce Wayne. It's a shame that George Clooney didn't take notes of these two actors. <br />Overall, while this movie does kind of suffer a bit from a much cheesier tone than the last two, it doesn't fail to impress at all. In fact it's a great and highly enjoyable successor to \\"Batman Returns\\" and almost perfectly balances the dark angst of the previous one and the greater but not excessively colorful and glitzy glamour sequences of this one. The scene where the Bat mobile went up the side of the building where the bad guys cars crashed and exploded was awesome and made for great laughs and seeing Two-Face scream in frustration and some occasionally hilarious Dick Tracy-esque music was funny as hell. Overall, this movie has plenty of fun to offer. I felt that the humor and drama fit well together here and balanced each other out where as the two completely clashed and ruined the 1997 sequel and most of the time, the drama and angst that made the first three Batman movies so great was completely absent from that one. I'm not that surprised at the high number of negative reviews that \\"Forever\\" has received but it doesn't deserve so much of it. \\"Batman Forever\\" may not rank up there with the first two in the series but it sure as h.e.l.l. beats out that God-Awful sequel that followed this one. Even now to this day, it still boggles my mind how Schumacher managed to pull it off so well with \\"Forever\\" and completely destroy the legacy with \\"B&R\\" two years later. :-\ Sadly I wish the title of this movie was true, being a saga that would go \\"Forever\\" but sadly it appears that it didn't and ended too soon with \\"Batman & Robin\\" which hardly even felt like a Batman movie at all. To me, this is the last Batman movie in the series. Highly recommended.
6305041156|2.0|My star rating has nothing to do with the mertis of the film. It has only to do with the total hatchet job Fox Lorber did in their infamous DVD transfer. By no means buy this version of the film, even though you think you're saving a couple bucks. I agree entirely with the reviewer who said the only thing to do with the DVD and it's case is to use it for a coaster.<br /><br /> The images are muddy and dark. The sound is old 78s quality. It really is a shameful, shoddy piece of work. By all means, order the movie. It's Kurosawa's magnum opus, great in every detail. Just make sure you shell out a few bucks more for the Masterworks edition, or splurge and go for the Kurosawa multi DVD collection.<br />This review is meant solely for the Fox Lorber 1985 DVD release.<br />BEK
B00000DC10|5.0|*SPLAT* That'll be the \\"new noise\\" you'll hear when that stuff hits the ceiling when you hear this album: it is one of the top 100 albums of all TIME to me! Ok at first it will turn you off with it's album name (or at least it did for me), then you pop it in and you're like: ...?!\\" It's pure insanity; don't know if they're the Aphex Twin or Glassjaw; but it's beatiful! Maybe you won't get into this but this album is truely revolutionary.The only thing I have to nag about is that (I have never seen them live), is that can all the producing that went into this lovely record be replicated on stage with 4 guys? Who knows and who gives a [fig]!? This is purely a splendid symphony of screamo/prog/punk/industrial: what have you.
B000002GYR|5.0|This is some jazzy stuff with soul. It's very pretty all the way through. You should look into all of Tom Waits' work.<br />From the opening song 'Ol' 55', it shows you just what Tom could do as a young man, making his lasting impression in music. And if you've never heard of him, (most people I know haven't) when you here this album, you'll automatically be wondering what else is out there by this great artist. (I'll tell you right now, there is about 3 decades of work, and it's all good and unique.) My favorite song on here is 'Ice Cream Man'. It's the only fast paced song on here, but that's not why I like it. It's just my favorite song on the album, with those beautiful bells playing a melody as the very jazzy music fades away. The first time I heard it, it was simply astonishing....Peace.
0425188809|5.0|This is a sensational book for all animal lovers and even I guess for those who don't like them. Imagine if dogs were a lot more intelligent then they actually are and you've got the main character of this book.  He escapes from some lab and becomes attached to a kind man (with a past that wants to catch up to him) and a beautiful shy woman.  He of course being a dog knows he should be their best friend and confronts those trying to do them harm.  Being a good dog isn't everyone's cup of tea and the same lab he escaped from has a creature hell bent on finding him and ripping him apart.<br />A human creature who doesn't know about the dog is determined to find the man he has accompanied and kill him.  I particularly liked this evil man who believes each person he kills take him closer to immortality and there are only a few more to go until he can never be killed himself.<br />With the way genetic engineering is going this is an extremely believable book.  You won't be watching TV once you've opened the front cover until you've turned the last page so buy some blank video tapes while you're online as well.
B000002UB3|5.0|All I can say is that I think that The Beatles are supreme. Anybody who wants to have something great in thier life should have this, and every other album that they have produced. <br />From beginning to end, it's great. All of thier albums are great, but Abbey Road is my favorite. It's simple, at the same time intricate, and is such a strong example of good music. 'The Beatles', will always be listened to.
B00008S2VG|5.0|Of course I do. I will admitt, I really didn't know what to think about the album at first listen. But it has definetly grown on me. Hollywood, is an awesome tune and should be the focus single. But American Life sounds great out in the clubs and you can get your groove on. I wouldn't say it is better or worse than any of her other albums. It's just different. She is always doing things different. Her sounds are unique. She is a great entertainer. This album is something I will enjoy for years to come. I definetly recommend it.
B000026156|5.0|I think this album is one of the great documents of free jazz. For anyone curious about the style, it's an ideal starting point--Holland's compositions nicely balance structure and freedom, and he and Barry Altschul are one of the most swinging rhythm sections in any jazz style. Added bonuses are horn players Sam Rivers, a sadly underrecorded master, and Anthony Braxton, playing a lot more accessibly and approachably than he sometimes sounds on his own albums. This album is more &quot;out&quot; than some of Holland's more recent recordings, but I still think it's his most challenging and original statement.
B00005Q66T|5.0|THIS WAS A GREAT COLLECTION OF SONGS ALL OF HER HITS FROM 1992-2001.MY ONLY WISH IS THAT MADONNA RECORDED ONE NEW TRACK FOR THIS CD IT WOULD HAVE BEEN AWESOME.WORTH BUYING ANYWAY.YOU GET A LITTLE DIFFERENT VERSIONS OF THE SONGS.
B000025XKM|5.0|In Alabama, where I live, during spring and summer mornings you can hear among the joyful, cacaphonous voices of the songbirds the low, melancholy call of the mourning dove.  This probably isn't the best comparison, since you have to know bird calls for it to mean anything, but if a mourning dove ever made a record, it would sound like Nick Drake<br />Admittedly, my first encounter with Nick Drake was through the infamous VW ad. For two years the song Pink Moon resided on my computer's hard drive under the title \\"VW Commercial - Cabrio Song\\" right next to the file \\"VW Commercial - Jetta Song\\" (Remember that one, where the wipers and everything else are in sync with the beat on the radio?). Well, eventually I found out that the song actually had a name and that that mysterious, downtrodden voice belonged to a real person. I did some research, read some reviews, and bought the album Pink Moon on amazon about a week and a half ago. When it came, I took it back to my room after classes, popped it in the CD player, and had a listen. <br />I've been listening to this short, 31 minute album over and over again for about 5 days. I am astonished by its simplistic beauty. Another reviewer was right in likening Pink Moon to impressionist poetry. Indeed, rather than presenting the listener with tangible, concrete images of tortured existence (such as those of his oft-invoked blues counterpart, Robert Johnson, i.e., running from the devil, trouble with women, homelessness), Drake's esoteric lyrics and seemingly apathetic delivery thereof evoke the state of mind of man at his most despairing. Pink Moon is not a photorealistic documentation of the emotions and experiences treated, but a canvas clothed in strokes of blue here and purple there, incoherent at close range. But when examined as a whole, this album paints a stunningly beautiful, however heartbreaking, picture.<br />Excluding the title track, which employs a bit of piano, the entire album is just Drake and his acoustic guitar. His fingerstyle playing is fantastic, and he employs alternate tuning to great effect; the ringing, blending tones of the open strings are gorgeous and fatten his sound considerably, and his chord voicings are unlike any I have ever heard.<br />This album comes highly, highly recommended. It is stark and arresting, and sure to move.

B00008H2LE|4.0|Overall a good album, but.....<BR>Like my title says If You Like It You Like It, linkin park has a rare sound, and if its your thing then buy the album, if it isnt go buy some hard rock and set some of your savings aside for hearing aids when you are 25. <BR>the songs are well crafted, i have had the thing for 2 months and i am still discovering new layers and beats, i was listing to a track 5 min ago, cant rember which 1, and found a realy erie spooky oooooooooooo hiding in the background of a chorus. and it took me a month to find the great piano in &quot;somewhere i belong&quot;,<BR>1 of the reviews here has some weired and interesting facts, i allways pictured the forward as a old pice of glass or somthing, not a CD burner, interesting.<BR>OVERALL, a good 2nd album, its hard to find a 2nd album this good, and they did a good job, even if they were a bit perfectionist.

0393317552|4.0|Mr Diamond asks us to follow him along some serious lines of questioning to consider that many fortituous accidents in their ecosystem, not some innate superiorities in their race, gave central and western Europeans advantages that they enjoy / exploit over the rest of the world even today.<br />This is actually pretty obvious, but no scientist has yet tried to empirically analyze this. For instance, on a very high level, we know that environmental accidents have determined many things in our past: 65 million years ago a 2km-wide object crashed into the Yucatan and caused a world-wide forest fire, mile-high tidal waves and years of darkness, wiping out 70% of life on earth (including the Dinosaurs). Conversely, using the a-bomb on Hiroshima in WWII, (indeed all of WWII, our costliest war to date) while huge in destructive power in human-wrought terms, is trivial to the overall outcome of life on earth in comparison. The former event played a huge role in the development of our species. The latter, while foreboding great cataclysm in store, did not.<br />A minority of Diamond's critics cite a small number of examples of faulty conclusions he has made in this book that I think he should look into. But many other critics pile a litany of absurd arguments against him that can be summed up as thinly veiled racism. I did, however, get a sense of some of the sweeping conclusions Diamond has made and wondered a bit whether he was going too far, but that does not reduce the value of this book as a compelling cross-examination of the history of the family of humankind.<br />Those who are attacking Mr. Diamond as being too Politically Correct, all I can say is that a cohesive scientific theory is being put together in this book, and those readers are welcome to attack it on its own merits, whereas implying a hidden agenda is simply sneering, mudslinging innuendo: go ahead an prove it if you're so sure.
B00005JKZV|5.0|When I first saw the movie, I was a bit disappointed; I was blown away by the wonderful effects, sounds, music, locations, makeup, design, battle sequences etc. yet was somewhat upset about the changes in the plot. Walking back to the car after the movie started a whole thinking process, mainly wondering why Peter Jackson chose to make these changes. I went back to the book in my head, and tried to humbly create my personal version of the Two Towers movie. After a while, I went to see it again, and again, and again. And now I can honestly say that my initial reaction was wrong. This movie serves its purpose - it delivers the story to the movie audience in the most thrilling and moving way. Well done.<br />I suppose that several plotlines were moved to the next film for climactic reasons (Shelob, the confrontation with Saruman, the Palantir etc.) My guess is they will reappear on the Return of the King. Some were cut off for obvious production reasons - otherwise, the film would have been 7 hours long (really - are the Entwives really that important for the flow of the story?) And the rest of the changes were modified to perhaps change the somewhat non-climactic nature of large parts of the books, mainly the parts with Treebeard, Faramir, and Frodo and Sam. <BR>In the book, the Treebeard sequence is slower and, well, feels less dangerous. Jackson added suspense and excitement to that. Frodo and Sam's journey is full of mostly uneventful travel and brilliant dialongs with Gollum. I hoped to have seen more of that dialog in the film, but the essence is there - the internal battle between Smeagol and Gollum and the slow deterioration of Frodo. Faramir's character was more positive in the book: I like the decision to make him darker and his trial by the Ring longer and more perilous to the Hobbits. And even though I resented that choice the most at first, I suppose a dark sequence such as the battle of Helm's Deep needs some comic relief delivered by Gimli. <BR>All in all - I think Jackson and his team did an expert job cinematically speaking. Purists would frown, of course, but simply because the film is not EXACTLY what Tolkien wrote, doesn't mean that it's not a good film. The main plotlines are delivered extremely well, and even modernized to a point where it is appealing to 21st century audience. Lighten up people - Tolkien was not deflied here. The films' release caused a massive surge in the books' sales: people read the story as a result of the films. Tolkien is being promoted even with this action packed somewhat more commercial version of it. Many people are exposed to the beauty and poetry of Tolkien even if they think that they will read that Legolas made a \\"Back to the Future\\" orc-shield skateboard trick on the steps of Helm's Deep.
0688163173|1.0|I have read all of Lehane's books. This one is a stinker. It gives an appearance of being convoluted and twists simply for the thrill of it - and not done well. Most of it is beyond being plausible and you get the impression the writer is just filling in the space.<br />A bit outlandish and not very good. Skip this one.
B00005JM03|2.0|band of thieves, led by Charlie Croker (Wahlberg), pulls off the ultimate heist by rigging the stoplights of the city of Los Angeles so that they can drive right out of the city with a carful of gold (in a safe that they're stealing back after Croker's double-crossing ex-partner, played by Edward Norton, stole it from Croker first), with nothing but greenlights, while everyone else gets redlights, thus keeping the roads plugged with the largest traffic jam in L.A. history, and the police from pursuing them. I didn't really enjoy this movie. the plot is corny and ed norton just doesn't look or sound like a bad guy. it does have some good action moments and it is worth too see but I wouldn't buy it
B000005JA8|1.0|Definitely not 3-chord pop, and not the pablum that you hear on the radio.  This is why I was attracted to it in the first place, but this is just a cacophony.  It's either a work of genius or a waste of time.  I'm voting for the latter.
B00008AY3L|5.0|Words alone cannot describe this album, but if i had to choose one, it would be &quot;amazing.&quot;  This is truley one of the best albums I have heard in a long time.  One might call it a gospel album, but don't let that stop you from picking this album up.  I am not one to like gospel albums myself.  From 'Amen Omen' to 'Bring the Funk,' you will not be disappointed in the least.

630542845X|5.0|This is a movie about an extraordinary individual Jeremy, whose nickname is Powder, due to being an albino. Just before his birth, his mother was hit by lightening, resulting in an incredibly heightened ability to 'play' with and use electrical fields.<br />As a teenager Powder's grandfather dies of natural causes, leaving him alone with the legal system. Because he's different he automatically attracts attention of the bad kind, which leads to some amazing and spectacular displays of what you can do with electricity, a Jacob's Ladder, and a dancing spoon.<br />This isn't your normal sort of movie, with \\"poor child with a problem turns out to be amazing, the bad guys become his friends and he gets the girl\\". Instead he was always amazing, he doesn't get really get the girl, the bad guys mainly stay trapped by fear, but Powder shows us the potential of the human heart and mind. It focusses on a theory of Einstein, who believed in life after death simply because energy does not disappear, it simply changes form. Powder can 'see inside' people, hear their thoughts, even those in a coma.<br />If you're looking for an action flick or a romance, go somewhere else. This is a thinking person's movie, despite several logical errors. It stirs the senses, opens the mind and spirit, and can give you hope for the future.
B000002KIE|4.0|The Sex Pistols were a band surrounded by scandal, thanks to the girlfriend-maiming Sid Vicious, and their tunes have been overlooked in recent years. \\"Never Mind the Bollocks\\" is quite possibly their most famous album for it is the one that houses the classic \\"Anarchy in the UK\\". This album is a must-have for fans of early punk.
B0000041Q3|5.0|This is silly. An entire world of famous opera critics all chose this Turandot as the standard for all others yet we still get attacks on Joan Sutherland.<BR>The nominations of Nilsson, Marton, or even Callas as the better princess are understandable, but they just didn't deliver as ideally as a bel canto prima donna.<BR>I can see the Nilsson nomination. Her voice is gigantic, and her high notes are reliable. But this is a recording. It doesn't matter how huge her voice is, she just doesn't have the warm heart of true womenhood when she is transform to a woman in love.<BR>As for Marton. All she does is shake her head to form a &quot;false&quot; vibrato as she screams her head off to try to deal with the high tessitura. And she has one of the most unpleasant sopranos I've heard in quite a while. Then there's one of my favorite divas, Maria Callas. But her Turandot didn't work either. The diva sang terribly and had tremendous difficulty with the high tessitura and intonation.<BR>Now to whom the majority of the finest critics in the world and most opera buffs agreed as the quintessential Turandot. The surprising Dame Joan Sutherland. I've enjoyed Dame Joan as Lucia and Norma for many years, but a Turandot? Heck,yes!<BR>I don't know if it's Mehta's coaching, or her husband's. But Dame Joan has pulled off a true tour de force. A grand Turandot with sumptuous tone, powerful high notes, and the ability to convince us that the heart of a cold princess can turn into a plain woman in love. And she does it with such a luxuriuous dramatic soprano sound that she converted me, a pure Puccini nut, into a believer. I wonder what would have happened if she went for Tosca. Could she have dethroned Callas as Floria Tosca? That is unlikely, but dame Joan certainly had the right tone of soprano to sing Tosca. But we'll never know.<BR>Pavarotti is without criticism as the Prince Calaf. He sounds youthful and heroic with just a touch of a big ego. The Nessum Dorma is his signature, and noone can sing it better.<BR>Caballe as Liu is equally superb. She uses her remarkable pianissimo vocalism and pathos to melt our hearts as the doomed slave girl. Yet there were moments that she was about to upstage Sutherland. Luckily, the diva holds back and sings with just the right amount of melting tones to make the balance of Turandot and Liu believable.<BR>Certainly Zubin Mehta's conducting is just pure magic and the sound of Decca's sonics are unbeatable.<BR>All in all, a glorious Turandot with not one major flaw I can think of. <BR>This makes this one of the greatest opera recording I own. One that I can compare with my Tosca with Callas, the Butterfly with Freni/Pavarotti, the Aida with Price/Vickers, and the Giulini Don Giovanni.
B0000025D0|5.0|Bruce entered my life here in England in 1980 with The River. At 14 years old, of course I listened to the barnstorming numbers and left ther rest.<br />A little while later I started gathering up the back catalogue. 'Born To Run' of course was seminal. Then I picked up 'Darkness' with the air of a collector just having to pill the gap on the shelf.<br />I agree with the reviewer who said that this was the first time he heard adult themes expressed in rock & roll. The album hit me squarely in the face and then picked me up and comforted me. It was, is and always will be my favourite album by any artist. On a desert island or a weekend in Utopia, this is the one for me.<br />It encompasses the human experience just as pertinently today as it must have back then. Something, you sense is wrong with the world. You feel helpless, alone, angry, frustrated - the world is slowly going mad under the threat of terrorism and you can't get a date. It's as grand and lowly pathetic as that.<br />And the musical mirror to your sense of desolation but (and this is important) your sense of hope lies in this album.<br />It moves me today at 37 like it did all those years ago. That's the strength of the album and the artistic zenith that Bruce achieved. To transcend the years (and indeed an American to an Englishman!!) is testiment.<br />If this album doesn't move you, then you're not functioning!!!<br />From the opening drums roll of 'Badlands' through to the fading strains of the title track (my favourite number) this album rocks in the toughest ranks and still leaves you believing in a promised land.
0385504209|5.0|Dan Brown's, The Da Vinci Code is an intruiging and enlightening atypical adventure thriller with strong religious overtones.<br />Jacques Sauniere, curator of the Louvre had been found murdered within a locked room in the museum.  We learn that he has fallen victim to an albino monk called Silas working for the Opus Dei.  The Opus Dei (translates to God's Work) is a radical branch of the Catholic church that has been given blessing by the Vatican.  Opus Dei is headed by Bishop Manuel Aringanosa, Silas' mentor.  Sauniere had a meeting scheduled with Robert Langdon, an esteemed Harvard University professor of religious symbology.  Langdon becomes the prime suspect of Captain Bezu Fache, head of the Direction Centrale Police Judiciaire (French FBI), in Sauniere's murder.<br />The learned Langdon suspects that Sauniere is the top man in the Priory of Sion, an ancient secret society and an offshoot of the Knights Templar entrusted with the keeping of the secrets of the Holy Grail.  As top man, Sauniere would be one of four men entrusted with the secret of the whereabouts of the Holy Grail.  Unfortunately the other three bearers of this precious secret have also been murdered on this night.<br />Before his death Sauniere a talented cryptologist and expert of goddesses in religion left a series of clues to pass down the Priory secrets before they might be lost forever.  He used Leonardo da Vinci references and even wrote a secret code on the Mona Lisa itself.  The cryptology department of the Judicial Police was sent in to decipher these codes and clues. Amazingly the chief cryptologist on the case was Sophie Neveu, the granddaughter of Sauniere.<br />Langdon and Neveu get thrown together as a team, as Sauniere planned, to unravel the many clues that would lead them to this carefully guarded secret.  The path leads them to a series of mind boggling discoveries which leave both the book's characters and the reader flabbergasted.<br />The Da Vinci Code was expertly written and compelled me to pursue additional research on te subject matter.  I'm still finding it hard to separate what is fact and fiction in Browns thoroughly engrossing novel.n and compelled me to pursue additional research on te subject matter.

B00000DR5D|3.0|Years ago, far far away in a distant galaxy, well sort of, I attended one of the first Tangerine Dream concerts held in Newcastle upon Tyne in the UK. Sitting five rows from the front in the stalls, I was able to see things that many others could not...the musicians. On that tour they wanted the audience to focus on the music so they were cloaked in darkness on the stage with a screen to pick up from the music and have pictures projected on it. At the interval and at the end the musicians merely left the stage without a word and the concert was over.<br />To me this was a remarkable contrast to many others who were performing at the time and it struck me that they had a similar attitude towards their work as the Grateful Dead who were a different type of pioneering, improvisational &quot;rock&quot; band.<br />A few years later I listened intently to a live broadcast of Tangerine Dream live at Coventry Cathedral. If I remember correctly it was one of the BBC's earliest stereo broadcasts which I taped at the time and listened too many times over the years until the tape snapped.<br />Ricochet is an edited version of that concert and another in France. It is somewhat of a disappointment in that there is evidence of overdubs and considerable editing which is a shame because it really does not reflect the spontanaeity of the original concert. The fact that they were even able to perform live at all is somewhat of a miracle anyway but it really is a shame that there are no real recordings of the earlier concerts in official circulation.<br />Tangerine Dream were an awesome band in those early years when their sound was new, original and path-breaking. Today they are rightly considered to be one of the precursors of ambient and trip-hop. Ricochet is not the monument it should have been. Perhaps the BBC can accomodate fans sufficiently to release their recordings of the Coventry Cathedral event complete with a nice picture of the Cathedral itself so that fans might see the inspiratiuon behind the music.<br />I wish I could have fixed that tape!inspiratiuon behind the music.<br />I wish I could have fixed that tape!
B000002534|4.0|A wonderful piece from Carlos' \\"fusion\\" days.  BUT, the CD release is marred by remix-transfer, which is, to be diplomatic, lousy.    What suffers most is the percussion work, notably   Armando Perraza's astonishing bongo work on the closing medley.  (I've gotten samples from the LP release by streamed audio over my dial-up modem and cheesy  desk-top speakers which sounded better than the CD does on a good home system. )     There are percussionists out there who consider Perraza's work to be one of the best bongo performances ever recorded;  why can't we hear it?

B00002MZ4W|4.0|The Apple has finally ripen. Fiona Apple has finally settled down, left her underwear, undernourished and oversexed look back in he bedroom. It's a \\"Criminal\\" act we welcome. On this follow-up to her debut CD, Fiona voice is husky and heartfelt; she ignites torch songs with a jazzy flame --- made even more riveting by the bare-bones, yet atmospheric, orchestrations. The songwriter is (almost) as wordly and wonderous as the singer. And just as delicious.
B000067CPX|3.0|I bought this cd 2 days after it first debuted.  I popped it in, expecting a musical revelation.  A wet slap in the face, I guess you could say.  I got slapped in the face alright, with a wet fish.  Now this cd doesn't stink, I'll say that.  But it frankly isn't as good as people say it is.  <br />Well, I suppose that the people who grew up with the Chilis are warranted to worship it as they do.  The Chilis started out as strong, funky in-your-face-we-wear-socks-on-our-penises rockers.  In 1999's Californication we saw some foreplay with the melodic tunes that would become their next album, but funk still reigned supreme for them.  Then they drifted into strange territory with their 9th and current album, By the Way.  They have given us a dreamy, melodic, self examining Californian (every time I listen to it, I feel as if I'm in a ghostly San Fransisco environment)sound.  Now the people that have been with the Chilis from the start have been hard and fast, and now as they slow down and come into their years, they take that journey with the Chilis, who have slowed down and looked at the world around them.  But for me, I'm coming up, I enjoy the hard, fast, ska/funk/punk sound.  Perhaps 10 years from now I'll put this cd in and realize just what they were talking about.  But for now, all I hear is drifting, rambling, and somewhat annoying (Can't Stop, possibly the most overplayed, overlong and annoying song on the ablum) ponderings.  <br />The only exception I give is the chilling closing: Venice Queen.  I dare someone to listen to that song and not blink his/her eyes in astonishment.  If you want the Chilis that made me fall in love with them, check out One Hot Minute, Mother's Milk, and BloodSugarSexMajik
0345413377|5.0|Before I start this review, let me state this: I am a HUGE fan of Philip Pullman!!! He is an astounding author whose works should not be ignored. If you liked this book, read his others.<br />Now then, Pullman has yet again pulled of an amazing book. The first two books of His Dark Materials were wonderful, bringing us into the worlds of Lyra and Will. However, this one takes the cake!! Masterful descriptions, complex and enjoyable characters and a thoroughly captivating plot sucked me right into the book itself. Here are those reasons and more of why this is such a great book.<BR>     <BR>1) Essentially, this book is written for adolescents and teenagers. However, unlike most authors of books of this nature, Pullman has not watered down anything for the reader. He keeps the book running with its intense plot and complex characters and doesn't stop to condescend or baby the audience. Instead, he assumes that they have knowledge and are wise enough to get what he's talking about.<BR>     <BR>2) The characters are varied and amazing in their variety. They range from humans, armored bears, antelope like creatures with wheels (mulefa), pixie-ish creatures with poisoned hooks on their feet (Gallivespians), and angels to the dead. They all are given emotions and thoughts that the reader can relate and argue with. My personal favorites are the armored bears (a lot like our polar bears) and the mulefa (Pullman has truly come up with an amazing species that travels with seed pods attached to their hooked feet and communicate with their trunks). Even the humans, the ones that would seem the most boring, are very three-dimensional.<br />3) The places that Lyra and Will travel to are very life-like. One feels that they are standing next to them as the birds sing, and the snow falls. \\"In a valley shaded with rhododendrons, close to the snow line, where a stream milky with meltwater splashed and where doves and linnets flew among the immense pines, lay a cave, half-hidden by thecrag above and the stiff heavy leaves that clustered below.\\" If that isn't impressive, I don't know what is!<br />4) Those who are very religious (or more specifically of the Christian faith) will more than likely be offended by this book. Many would (and have) say that Pullman is sacrilegious and a blasphemer. However, that is one of the reasons the plot is so great. Pullman isn't afraid bringing outside elements into this book and so makes the plot that much more stimulating. The plot is very dark and has a way of grabbing you behind the neck with surprising events. So if dark and sinister plots or \\"disrespectful\\" writing about the Church offends you, you probably shouldn't read this book. For those up for it, though, you are in for a wild ride.<br />I could go on and on about how great this book is and how much it has affected and influenced me, but that would take more than one review to do. So, if you are at all intrigued by this book, by all means GET IT!!!!!!! Thank you, and good night!!!

There really isn't a song I dislike (which can't always be said for artists that I love and are respected), and I was quite haunted by &quot;I'm With You.&quot;<br />No, I don't think she's a genius, or god's gift to music.  I could care less about her &quot;look&quot; or the fact that she claims to be &quot;punk&quot; and has *no* idea what that is.<br />She's a teenager who's managed to find some outlet for her creativity, and done it more than reasonably well.  And if her lyrics are sometimes a little juvinile for my taste...well...let's see what a couple more years do for her, eh?

B000006Y12|5.0|...P>Seriously, what can be said about this album that hasn't already been said? It's already achieved legendary status amongst metalheads worldwide, not only for its standing as one of the famed mid-90s Gothenburg, Sweden bands that created the melodic death metal genre, but equally for its stellar consistency from the first to the last track. Yes, it's that good.<br />Unless you've been living under a rock, or somehow thought metal was the latest LINKIN PARK album, The Gallery is most likely already in your collection and this review will serve little more purpose than confirming what you already knew. If for some reason you don't have this album, for shame. Read on.<br />The Gallery was DARK TRANQUILLITY'S sophomore release, following the equally legendary Skydancer debut and preceding the equally revered The Mind's I. It's rare enough for a band to put out 3 straight consistently high quality songs, let alone 3 full albums. At any rate - stop me if you've heard this before - DARK TRANQUILLITY managed to capture all that is good about aggressive thrash, death metal & harmonious lead guitar work and created 11 songs of pure metal bliss. Even today, nearly 8 years later, this album stands tall above many of the bands that DARK TRANQUILLITY themselves can take some credit for spawning. There have been exactly 3 or 4 monumental moments in the history of heavy metal, beginning with the advent of the New Wave of British Heavy Metal in the late 1970s (a movement that DARK TRANQUILLITY is no stranger too, as they've cleared paid homage to the masters like IRON MAIDEN here). Bands like IRON MAIDEN, SAXON and JUDAS PRIEST created a style that has influenced thousands upon thousands of bands and continues to do so today. In the early 1980s, METALLICA and MEGADETH created what came to be known as thrash metal, which in its simplest terms was a rougher, more aggressive and more technical traditional metal. In the late 1980s, DEATH and MORBID ANGEL took that and turned the anger up a notch; death metal was born. In the early 1990s, bands like DARK TRANQUILLITY and their peers IN FLAMES, AT THE GATES, EUCHARIST (and a few others) melded the best parts of all those styles and voila, melodic death metal was born. Like it, love it, hate it, be sick of it, DARK TRANQUILLITY will always be a part of a scene that spawned an entire genre of music. Not many bands can say that. And no, I didn't forget about all you corpse-painted black metal kids; that scene just has no bearing on the point I'm making here (and for the record, the early-1990s Norwegian movement led by DARKTHRONE & MAYHEM is the other major metal moment I earlier referred to).<br />And that's about it; I didn't feel like going through songs, or describing how wonderfully harmonious the guitars are, or how incredibly passionate lead growler Mikael Stanne's vokills are. Whoops, I just did. The bottom line is that this is arguably 1 of the most important metal albums ever, at the very least of the past 15 years. No metalhead should be without it. The rating above is a no-brainer. Get it.
0743244249|3.0|Delillo is, undisputedly, one of the great contemporary authors, but this book falls a bit short of the bar set, albeit almost unreachably high, by White Noise.  As usual, his characterization capitalizes on the protagonists unusual thought patterns and conclusions that are drawn from seemingly ordinary situations.  The true genius of Delillo is that his characters are like philosophical machines, rather than normal people, but we perceive them, in a way, just like ourselves.  What is really disappointing about this book is that the idea is so good, but the end result isnt refined enough.  Fast paced Manhattan, stretch limousines, fancy gadgetry, the emptiness, of moneyWhats not to love (or love to hate)?  Its all there, but the story doesnt push the reader like Delillos other works.  We are given the framework for a great novel, but the conclusions arent monumental enough to warrant a work with such a thin plot line.  Of course the book still warrants reading for lovers of contemporary fiction.
B000002J27|5.0|Upon Peter Gabriel's departure following \\"The Lamb Lies Down On Broadway\\" tour in 1975, the British press were predicting the death of Genesis, because they assumed Peter wrote everything, and therefore he WAS Genesis. The truth was that Gabriel wrote mostly all of the lyrics, while the rest of the music was composed by the other four members. After the smoke had cleared, Genesis was left a quartet, and therefore were determined to prove to the world Genesis were still the giants of the progressive rock scene, as well as make the British press eat their own words. And boy, did Phil Collins, Michael Rutherford, Tony Banks and Steve Hackett make the media eat those words, or what? The music on \\"A Trick of the Tail\\" will definitely attest to that fact. Even though Peter Gabriel may be gone from the band, his spirit is still etched in a majority of the selections here. The opening track, \\"Dance On A Volcano\\" gets \\"Trick...\\" moving in grand, artsy progressive fashion, and the progressive traits never let up through the entire CD. This is followed by the gorgeous Steve Hackett/Tony Banks composition \\"Entangled\\" - where Banks' mellotron intricacies and Hackett's signature guitar virtuosity lead the way. Then, it's on to the hard-hitting punch of \\"Squonk\\", perhaps the proggiest song on \\"ATOTT\\". This is where Collins' vocals are at their most harsh, which add a greater degree of character to this Banks/Rutherford composition. The desert swept nuances of \\"Mad Man Moon\\" close out the first half of \\"ATOTT\\", and it's on to the latter half. The beginning of the second half starts off with what is perhaps the weakest song on \\"Trick...\\" - the slightly \\"off-color\\" humor of \\"Robbery, Assault & Battery\\". The cops & robbers story featured here doesn't exactly grab my interest, thus, it lacks a characteristic which made Gabriel-era Genesis such a pleasure to listen to. Peter Gabriel brought such a unique air of wit and character depth to each individual role on record, that it breathed such life into the songs. Phil Collins, on the other hand, brings very little, if any, life to the charaterizations here and on \\"Wind & Wuthering\\", that they all sound very monotonous, thus sucking all the humor out of the otherwise witty story. Then, it is on to the other best song on the CD, the unpretentiously beautiful \\"Ripples\\". When listening to this track and \\"Entangled\\", it is easy to see how Steve Hackett's musical and (painfully few) lyrical contributions were important to the production of this album (including \\"Wind & Wuthering\\" to the same degree) and to Genesis as a unified whole. The title track is almost a sharp contrast to both of the above tracks, as it would sort of foreshadow the pop music that was in their future. \\"Los Endos\\" closes the CD with a thunderous bang, and is quite fusiony, featuring ballsy jazz/rock influences. Phil Collins would immediately explore this territory with Brand X - with which he would join upon the release of \\"ATOTT\\". As far as the remastered version of \\"Trick...\\" is concerned, the overall quality of sound is a drastic improvement, when compared to the first generation version. In the remastered edition, one can now hear the crispness of the mellotron, guitar and drum sounds, which all sounded fuzzy on the first generation British CD I own. Even Phil Collins' vocals on this \\"new and improved\\" version sound more strong and more muscular, a great improvement over his \\"mousey\\" style, as presented on the early CD. Even the texture contained within the CD booklet's contents is a 360 degree improvement. Whereas the older CD booklet contained black and white illustrations on a white background, the remastered CD booklet contains all color illustrations - brown figures on a goldenrod background, making it a virtual rainbow cornucopia. Now, with \\"A Trick of the Tail\\" completed, Genesis accomplished at least two major feats. One, they made \\"ATOTT\\" a huge seller, which outsold all prior Genesis releases up to that point. Two, theyfinally sent the critics and their narrow-minded viewpoints packing, letting them know that Genesis was here to stay. Athough this legendary band is now no more, their spirit has never left since. With that said, no progressive rock collection is complete without \\"A Trick of the Tail\\" and the group's follow up \\"Wind & Wuthering\\" added to your classic Genesis collection.finally sent the critics and their narrow-minded viewpoints packing, letting them know that Genesis was here to stay.

0385504209|5.0|I read this book in a day because I couldn't put it down. The best and most intriguing book I've read in awhile,but definitely for a thinking reader with an inquiring mind and a love of thrillers.The &quot;political&quot; content may offend some dogged Christians, but I found it enlightening and at the same time riveting. Can't wait to read his other books.
B00000F1D3|4.0|What can be said about a five-year-old album that has not already been said by the previous 442 &quot;critics&quot;???<br />&quot;Believe&quot; is like a musical time capsule of various Cher styles: she does the disco/dance thing (&quot;Believe&quot;, &quot;The Power&quot;, &quot;Runaway&quot;, &quot;All or Nothing&quot;, &quot;Strong Enough&quot;, &quot;Love is the Groove&quot;), the pop diva thing (&quot;Dove' L'Amore&quot; and &quot;Takin' Back My Heart&quot;) and the homage-to-herself thing (&quot;We All Sleep Alone&quot;).<br />Not bad for a woman that is still churning out hits long after most of her contemporaries have bought the farm, musically, that is.

0385504209|2.0|Nicely researched.  Doesn't have nearly the character appeal as any of Crichton's books.
0812580346|5.0|I found &quot;Flash Forward&quot; to be one of the best time travel books I've ever read. Some of the technology was over my head but the premise of the book is great. Due to an experiment, everyone on  earth flashes forward to their life in the future. Based on that glimpse, many try to change the way their future is going to pan out. This book really makes you think. I've read 3 books by Sawyer and I'm going to continue because so far, they are mind-blowingly fun!
B00006ALGL|5.0|i don't think words can even explain just how amazing this album is.  damien sings the 10 songs of this album beautifuly and tells an amazing story that anyone can relate to about falling for someone, and finally realizing that they don't love you back...although every track is simply astounding, my highlights have to be 4. Cannonball, 6. Amie, 7. Cheers darlin', and 9. I Remember.  He just got signed with Warner Brothers/Reprise, so look for O to be released in the states soon.  also, go see him at a show if you can get to it, it is definately worth whatever you have to pay.
B000089RVX|5.0|I been listening to music for a very long time, from classical to new age, rock and I have been very discriminating. I first heard of Evanescence from the tracks on the Daredevil album. When I heard those two songs I was taken away by what can be among the best goth rock songs I heard in a long time. It complelled me to buy their album Fallen, and I never regreted it since. Since that time I have seeked out some of their older work before popularity, and it been an amazing journey. I cannot find a single peice of their work that is not a great peice of music, even when they were green under the collar. I easily put them alongside my Nightwish and Inkubus Sukkubus albums. 5 Stars because I cannot give them a 10 on here. I agree with another reviewer who says for every one that bashes them there 25 that say they are great. I am sorry for those that don't like them, Evanescence is not the music for an angry youth but for those with a far more balance palette for music.
B00005YW4H|5.0|This CD is perfect for relaxing with a glass of wine or as background music for a nice dinner.  Her voice is mesmerizing and I haven't yet gotten past the point where I can listen to this CD for practically any occasion.  Although I can't imaginge a CD that would top this one I'm sure she will do it again.  <br />My only complaint is that she is holding her Salt Lake City concert at a small venue that was sold out before the tickets even went on sale to the public.  Maybe next time.
B00008S2VG|3.0|ok so it's not as cute as ray of light or as cool as Music, but it ain't THAT bad. i enjoyed &quot;hollywood&quot; where madonna demonstrates a somewhat shirley manson voice that i didn't think she'd be able to perform, but it's pretty good. and the sounds of &quot;easy ride&quot; are quite impressive. the album in general is very minimalistic which means you won't shake your bon-bon listening to it, but i think it does manage to give a certain mood and message. i can see why it's not appealing to madonna fans as such, sounds more like an indie/electro album to me, but i think u should give it a chance. NO artist can perform top-notch all the time but i don't think this is at the bottom, dissapointments are inevitable as everybody has their hopes too high up for a great artist like madonna. ;)
B00005JLEU|5.0|Awesome Awesome movie. Watch the Japanese version tho and read hte subtitles instead of listening to dubs. This one was surprisingly ok but the original is always better because the voices match the lips and what not. Very fantabulastic and imaginative. This is one of hte most creative and action-packed movies i have ever seen. So if ur tired of sappy Disney movies, give this a shot~
B00005JM93|3.0|Irreversible?This is a key theme in this film where the scenes unfold in reverse chronological order,a technique that, apart from being irritating,just doesn't work as a film.I can only assume that it looked good as a script!Just so you know.<BR>I was anxious to see the film which caused hundreds of  viewers to storm out of the Cannes premiere and was also the biggest crisis for the emergency services in 25 years of Cannes-there were several panic attack victims.<br />This has to be pretty rough stuff i told myself on settling down to watch the film.<BR>Anyone who doesn't know the plot of the film can stop reading now(and don't say i ruined it for you later!).Basically a classy french girl is the unfortunate victim of a brutal(and it is sick) rape which leads to all sorts of recriminations-or does it?<BR>A brief summary,perhaps,but that's essentially it.<BR>Given the propensity of french film makers to be different and weird,the back to front format of the film adds absolutely nothing to the plot-you could watch the scenes as the story was meant to be and enjoy it more easily.<BR>The opening credits roll  back to front-like the film Seven,which is a bit sinister,apart from anything else.The eerie(almost) monotone music continues throughout the first(or final)scene and frankly goes on too long-a technique which fails in this scene but adds to the rape scene where the voyeuristic camerawork builds apprehension which is almost worse than the act itself-always assuming,of course,that you know what's coming.<BR>It's possible that you might check out this film as a Monica Bellucci fan but her elegance and beauty in this film only disarms the viewer and doesn't prepare you for the brutality to follow.I've probably understated the case but this is a very violent film at times and is definitely not for everyone.<BR>The critics seem to be in two camps-they either denounce director Gaspar Noe as a sick puppy or hail him as an innovative filmmaker.<BR>I think this is an interesting film.It is,however,essential to have an idea of what's coming-you'll be far too shocked otherwise.I also wonder about the motives of a director who has been quoted as saying that he's always wanted to film a rape scene.Why,Gaspar,why!!!!?<BR>It's good because it's original but it's not a brilliantly original film.Make of that what you will.
B000000WJZ|5.0|In my mind Billy Corgan is an exquisite song writer and one of the greatest artists of all time. Time after time The Smashing Pumpkins have delivered classic after classic album and sadly the demise of the 'pumpkins came after their final warm and beautiful studio album Machina/The Machines Of God which was followed up by a final goodbye tour and a best of (rotten apples). Since then Corgan has gone on to form Zwan which extends Corgan's genius songwriting and notorius nasally/whiny voice (which u either love or hate) and Jimmy Chamberlain followed him adding his incredible power drumming to the cause. End of an era? Only for Pumpkins but their albums are unforgettable classics nethertheless.<BR>Siamese Dream is just out of this world. It's got everything. Corgan's voice is incredible ranging from gentle to an onslaught of his notorious nasally voice. James Iha's guitar playing is sensational, D'arcy's bass lines on this album are quite amazing and as for Jimmy Chamberlain- Wow. Chamberlain's drumming is quite simply mindblowing. Arguably the best rock/jazz incorporated style drumming in the music business other than Dave Grohl. Id love to hear them have a jamming session together! Every single song on this album is special and the album is a classic through and through. <BR>Stand out tracks are : Cherub rock, Quiet, Today, Disarm, Geek U.S.A and Mayonaise. This album is extremely angsty and has an air of sweet sorrow attached to it especially on Disarm and mayonaise which are so beautiful. I remember Corgan saying in an interview this album saved him (because his childhood abuse made him fragile and he felt he couldn't open up his feelings in songs in case something happened again) and you can see it in his heartfelt and enchanting lyrics, hearing the extent of his pain in this album through each song.  Gone but not forgotten. Pure genius.
1577311523|5.0|A very very special book. To a non-religious person like me, this can serve the role of the bible. It lays a deeply spiritual, deeply internal life philosophy about living in the moment - the Now, not trying to get out of life's varied pleasures and accomplishments something they can never give you. Something that can only come from inside. This is a difficult book, it deeply affected me and threw me into emotional turmoil and possibly the deepest bout of depression I've ever experienced. That was because if you feel the truth of the book's message then you have to change how you look at the world, the very person you are. This loss of identity is viscerally unsettling and scary, how could it be otherwise?<br />I have changed, and have taken a step towards the life the book teaches is worth living. In a few situations that have come up, I've acted differently than I would have before reading this book, to my own tremendous surprise. I think that is the greatest praise one can give a book like this. I won't say that I'm a different person, and it may well be that time and routine will erase whatever effect this book had, but in the Now, I'm different.

B000002J1F|5.0|Tony Kaye left Yes after the grossly underrated Yes Album in 1971, to be replaced by the godly Rick Wakeman. This album may have been rushed to pay for all of Wakeman's gear, but Fragile still sounds like a well-crafted classic.<BR>Fragile starts off with the breath taking song &quot;Roundabout,&quot; which is easily one of the greatest classc rock songs of all time, with a hook that rules, an exciting middle section that will blow you away, and organ solos by Wakeman and guitar solos by Steve Howe that are almost untouched. The other group-constructed songs are amazing as well, like &quot;South Side of the Sky&quot; easily Ye's bleakest and darkest song, and the 11-minute chaotic/serene/schizophrenic &quot;Heart of the Sunrise.&quot;<BR>The other 5 pieces are individual ideas of the group. You have first Rick Wakeman's rendition of a Brahms composition (&quot;Cans and Brahms&quot;), a 35 minute experimental rhythm exercise by Bill Bruford (5% of Nothing), Jon Anderson's vocal harmonies (&quot;We Have Heaven&quot;), Chris Squire's psychedelic bass solo (&quot;The Fish&quot;), and Steve Howe's classic guitar solo &quot;Mood for a Day.&quot; This is an essential classic rock album, and unfortunately overlooked due to the bad rap art rock/progressive rock gets. Ignore the negative attitude towards progressive rock. Ignore labels in general. Just buy this album, sit back, and absorb the music.
B000003TA4|5.0|This is an amazing album. Here is a rundown on the tracks:<br />SMELLS LIKE TEEN SPIRIT(7/10): You have to have been born yesterday to not have heard this song. This is a good song, but I gave it 7 out of 10 because of how overplayed it is.<br />IN BLOOM(9/10): One of the more slower songs on this album, but still is a good Nirvana song attacking macho males.<br />COME AS YOU ARE(10/10): I fell in love with this song when I first heard it, and has a different sound to the usual Nirvana: Kurt Cobain uses less of the distortion pedal and more of tht flanger pedal.<br />BREED(7/10): An ambassador for the punkier side of Nirvana, but the tune is pretty repetitive. Quite good lyrics though.<br />LITHIUM(11/10): WOOHOO NOW LISTEN VERY CAREFULLY THIS SONG ROCKS AND BECAUSE OF THAT FACT I GOT INTO NIRVANA'S MUSIC I WOULD PICK THIS OVER SLTS ANY DAY.<br />POLLY(6/10): An acoustic song, I like the lyrics but that's the only thing in the song I can stand<br />TERRITORIAL PISSINGS(10/10): The ultimate punk rock anthem.<br />DRAIN YOU(3/10):No offence to anyone, but I skip this track everytime I listen to this CD. I gave it 3 because of the bit in the middle where it all goes quiet.<br />LOUNGE ACT(5/10): Another track I skip. This song is moderatly slow, and sounds similar to 'Hairspray Queen' off 'Incestiside'.<br />STAY AWAY(11/10): One of my 3 favourite Nirvana songs (The other two being 'Lithium ' and 'Radio Friendly Unit Shifter' off 'In Utero'). Anyway, this is the fastest Nirvana song off this CD.<br />ON A PLAIN(9/10): This song is also on the 'Unplugged' CD, but this one is faster and has feedback at the beginning.<br />SOMETHING IN THE WAY(10/10): This song is about Kurts youth, and is the slowest song on the CD. It sends chills up my spine everytime I hear it.

B000066NW0|1.0|I bought this CD a long while back before I was exposed to the real sickness that seems to be seeping through MTV that is Avril Lavigne. And even when I DID like her, I was not at all impressed with the CD. This CD's high points are \\"Losing Grip\\" and \\"Unwanted\\". Anything else on this CD is just not worth having your ears bleed. I mean come on, what 18 year old girl writes something as childish as \\"Sk8er Boi\\", or something so inane as to \\"I'm not the milk and Cheerios in your spoon, It's not a simple here we go not so soon, I might have fallen for that when I was 14 and a little more green\\" I'm sorry, but what was that? Oh, and this: \\"I never spend less than an hour, washin' my hair in the shower. It always takes five hours to make it straight. So I'll braid it in a zillion braids, though it may take a friggin' day. There's nothin' else better to do anyway\\" This CD made me want to lick my eyes. ...
B000000H6Y|2.0|Type O Negative is probably THE most over rated &quot;goth/metal&quot; band out there. I heard that this band, and particularly, this album was amazing, but when I got it I was severely underwhelmed. The lyrics are nothing short of stupid (Black No. 1 is about HAIR DYE), the melodies are bland, and the vocals sound like that guy from Crash Test Dummies. Avoid this.
B00005K3NY|3.0|As is the case of most of Cronenberg's work, the plot of Scanners begins in a straight line, becomes murky, and then almost nonsensical, The Fly remake being the exception, but barely.   That's not to say that Scanners wasn't enjoyable.  The special effects really are what make the movie; the exploding head in the beginning has since become one of horror's greatest movie moments-it's that priceless.  The acting, with the exception of Patrick McGoohan, is non-plussed and wooden, oftentimes just downright uninspired.  Steven Lack has to be one of the most ironic and appropriate names for an actor that ever existed.  At it's heart, Scanners is an action movie, there are plenty of scenes of tension that move the story forward; at no point will you feel very bogged down by exposition until you get to the ending, and then you will have whiplash from having had the whole story laid on you so fast.  Many Cronenberg elements can be seen in this film:  excessive violence, fatalistic outlooks from many of the characters, and Cronenberg's own patented pessimism, which seems to hover over every one of his films like a specter.  Cronenberg is a marginal director, by that I mean that he doesn't take the easy road to get his message across to you.  Many of his films are a lesson in hubris coupled with excessive power.  Just don't try to take any of this with you when you watch Crash.  There just was no excuse for that one.  Enjoy.
0743200748|4.0|Stephen Ambrose extracts Famous and Not-So-Famous friendships from the archives of time, and uses History to teach a valuable lesson.  Ambrose demonstrates that great people in History have overcome great obstacles, bolstered sometimes only by the loyalty of close friends.  His chapter on Veterans was particularly inspiring, especially in his description of how two former Allied Soldiers -- one of whom was Richard Winters of Easy Company -- verbally defended a lecturing former German World War II officer from the ignorant accusations of a self-righteous student years after the war.  Also inspiring was the chapter on the friendship of Lewis and Clark, as well as that of the lasting effects of the bonding of the men of Easy Company.  This is a wonderful work.
B00005YW4H|5.0|Norah is a goddess.  This whole CD is so calming and relaxing.  It's the perfect album to listen to after a rough day, or even a good day.  You can pop it in for any occasion.  I love how effortless Norah's style is.  She has an absolutely hynotic voice, and everyone should own a copy of this album.

6304428928|5.0|Charlie (Tom Cruise) and Raymond (Dustin Hoffman) do an excellent job of acting in this movie.  Raymond, portraying an autistic, inherits three million dollars from his deceased father.  Charlie, his younger brother, tries to trick him out of the money. There are many comical scenes in this movie as Charlie tries to figure out his autistic brother's day to day activities and restrictions.  Working with someone who is autistic takes a lot of patience.   Even though Charlie loses his patience's a lot with Raymond, they learn very valuable lessons of life.  Together they travel across America, teaching each other lessons only brothers can appreciate learning from each other.  This is a must see movie that portrays the many trials and tribulations that are solved by two brother's unconditional love.
B000089RVX|5.0|This is the first album I've ever bought based solely on one song (Bring Me To Life). What an album! I'll admit, the songs do follow a general theme (both lyrically and musically), but they are varied enough to keep me listening over and over again. The album features a great combination of powerful songs (Bring Me To Life, Everybody's Fool, Tourniquet, Taking Over Me, Whisper), beautiful piano ballads (My Immortal and Hello), and great mixes (everything else). Amy Lee's voice is what puts this group over the top. She has earned a spot in my collection with Alanis Morissette and Gwen Stefani.
B00005JLK1|4.0|About 40 years ago, a bloody massacre occured on a beautiful Italian ocean liner. Now, a crew of ocean explorers are planning to camp out on the ship and drag the gigantic thing to shore. But, when on the ship, the crew members discover that ghosts and spirits of the massacred people still dwell on the ship, and they must find a way to defeat them. Along the way, they will discover horrifying secrets about each other...<BR>I think this movie is very well acted, very well laid out and very well filmed. The one thing I have to complain about is the lack of unsuspecting horror. Things are sort of predictable, but fortunately, it does still have some qualities that make this film rather atmospherically creepy. I'd see this again anytime!<BR>But beware, this film has alot of gore and is NOT for people with weak stomachs or easily scared imaginations.
0316666343|3.0|This novel starts out with an interesting premise, and it could have been very thought-provoking if the author would have stopped jumping from one half-finished idea to the next.<br />Central character, Susie Salmon, speaking from Heaven, had her life ripped away from her at an early age.  So, I can understand, early in the novel, incomplete ideas being expressed.  But as the novel wears on, Susie is still expressing random thoughts and simply reminiscing about old times before she was murdered.  There is a sense of incompleteness, which I can understand the characters experience, but it is not very nice to force this incompleteness on your readers.<br />Other than the original premise of the murdered teenager remembering and musing on life going on without her, there simply isn't much else going on in this novel.  I know it's the first work from author, Alice Sebold; however, Janet Fitch, in her first novel (White Oleander) had a far better gripping plot, although depressing---&quot;White Oleander&quot;.<br />If you are looking for intelligent, literary quality-female writers....Anita Shreve, and even Susan Vreeland, are much better at expressing complete and direct ideas in a very succinct manner.<br />Everything about this novel is too vague and you are never sure what is real and what isn't.  A little mysticism and afterlife stuff is fine, but too much simply confuses the reader who is hungering for a plot line.<br />I learned my lesson.  Don't read something just because it is popular and a bestseller.
B000084T18|5.0|This album is hot, but he could lay low on that...thing. It says that on every single track (but not track. 1). The CD is hot! But, the Limited Edition DVD is more hotter. You crush 'em.<BR>GGGGG...G-UNIT!
B00005QW5X|5.0|I'm mostly a classical music fan, and don't even like much popular theatre--I hated \\"Chicago\\" on Broadway. But in NYC<br />summer of '98, I was fortunate enough to catch John Cameron<br />Mitchell and the original cast at the funky theatre where this<br />play, or rather event, started.  I can't say that I really liked<br />the experience that much, as the music was way too loud, but the<br />story is great and it was enjoyable just to watch the crowd,<br />many of them bewildered tourists just following the Times receommendations, take in this highly unusual production.<br />The movie is terrific.<br />For outlandishness, this film makes \\"Rocky Horror\\" look like<br />\\"To Sir with Love\\".  And while I am not a rock music fan, I was<br />years ago, and found this music wonderful and poignant.  And the whole thing has just the right touch of humor and over-the-top campiness.  There are scenes in this movie that one can watch like music videos and laugh hysterically, dance, or sing along.<br />Mitchell and his collaborator Stephen Trask should have won a bunch of Oscars for this--best picture, best music, best song,<br />(except there are so many good ones, it's hard to figure out which one's best) and best director.  The extras on this DVD are fascinating and moving. especially since Mitchell is the son of<br />a military big shot and his family is warmly accepting of his unconventionality.  The story of  how this amazing production<br />got started is unbelievable.  I certainly hope that Mitchell and his friends don't stop here, but go on to do more in music and theatre. Don't miss it.
078322804X|5.0|When I first saw this film at the time of it's release I thought how did a couple of Saturday Nite Live people get to surround themselves by so many blues artists, do blues performing themselves and not create something that was a musical joke.  Well I didn't know nuttin at the time, I'm better now.  It turns out Belushi and Aykroyd were/are serious blues aficionados and they basically gave/give work and exposure to the ongoing blues scene.  So this movie is not ... white guy stuff.  It's a real blast from beginning to end, with lots of music both background and on camera performance.  Naturally it's a comedy about the angst of modern times as experienced by two white blues men so there's lots of hyperbole concerning cop cars, shopping centers and transient living spaces and a certain supermodel of the time.  <br />The DVD is super expensive but well worth it considering the quality of the VHS.  Keep them doggies rollin.
B00004T0US|5.0|I don't understand why Moody Blue has been rated only 4 stars.  This is one of my favorite CDs.  I play it constantly.  It has a wonderful variety of fantastic songs, true Elvis rhythm and blues.  I'd rate it higher then 5 if it were possible.

0790729628|3.0|The director's cut just isn't the same as what we all liked when we originally saw the film in the theater.  I would like to buy the original film and can't seem to buy it.  All I can buy is the director's cut which doesn't give you the same 1940's feeling that the original film had.  If anyone knows where to get the original, you should post it.
6305558175|4.0|I am a dyed-in-the-wool romantic.  When I went to see this film in the theatre several years ago, I only knew it was a romance based on the French film The Return of Martin Guerre.  (I knew nothing about the original film either.)  I found Sommersby to be a very charming love story, everything I expected a romance to be.  I'm not a fan of Richard Gere, but I enjoyed his performance as Jack and he and Jodie Foster had excellent chemstry.  What I didn't expect was the way the film ended.  As the film moved towards it's conclusion, I reached for the tissues only to find I didn't have any! I thus sat there struggling to keep the tears at bay (it didn't work :) )<br />But it's not just a romance, there is a tinge of mystery.  Jack Sommersby, we assume from what we see on the screen, was not a nice person before the war.  He comes back a changed man  -- is it indeed Jack Sommersby -- or is it someone else?  <br />For those who enjoy a good period romance movie, this is an excellent choice.  If you enjoy a good cry, again, an excellent choice.
B00003CXE7|5.0|Where to start?  This one comes out of the gate swinging.  If you thought the archers' scene in \\"Robin Hood Prince of Theives\\" was a good one, you'll love how this movie opens up although it's a couple of shades darker.  From there it gets interesting on a drama level, although the action only subsides for a few minutes.<br />The heart of this movie is the jouney of a man named Maximus - a Roman General betrayed by a young (and quite mad) emperor and captured as a slave after being wounded.  As a slave he is forced to fight for his survival in the games.  As he did in his previous life, Maximus becomes a leader.  As a leader, but still a slave, Maximus now threatens the emperor who as time wears on threatens to destroy Rome from the inside with is growing madness.<br />The acting performances are absolutely superb, as is the story.  I had never seen Joaquin Phoenix before in anything, but his asking price should have doubled or better after this film.  Although Russell Crowe's performance is also exemplory, it was Joaquin playing the part of a man on the edge that had me glued to the screen, but I'm partial to really bad guys when they're played well and the screenwriters did an excellent job of making Commodus a man to be feared by interplaying what you see coming with what you don't.  Richard Harris' brief role is also a memorable performance.<br />The cinematagraphy is splendid as is Hans Zimmer's musical score.<br />The movie is long, but worth sitting through.<br />An important point here is that this movie involves a lot of blood, death, and strictly adult themes.  Don't let young children near this one.<br />The DVD extras are plentiful, including a commentary.  It's a two-disc set with deleted scenes, behind-the-scenes looks, and trailers as well as others.
B000068PQ0|4.0|There are, unfortunately, not many albums like \\"Yoshimi Battles the Pink Robots.\\" I enjoyed \\"Soft Bulletin\\" when I found it at a store last year, but what really dragged me in was the peculiar title of \\"Yoshimi.\\" It's a fun, sweet, sad, immensely fulfilling album.<br />The songs tend to have a slightly futuristic feel; first off is the catchy \\"Fight Test\\" (\\"I don't know where the sunbeams end/and the starlight begins/it's all a mystery\\"), the haunting \\"One More Robot/Sympathy 3000-21\\" about a robot developing emotions (don't cringe -- it's done wonderfully), the poignant time-travel song \\"All We Have is Now,\\" the somewhat more forgettable \\"It's Summertime (Throbbing Orange Pallbearers\\" and \\"Ego Tripping at the Gates of Hell,\\" and the fantastic, almost pleading \\"Are You a Hypnotist?\\".<br />But my favorite tracks may be \\"Yoshimi Battles the Pink Robots\\"; part one is a delightfully cheesy description of a karate girl who is battling the evil robots. (\\"Oh Yoshimi/they don't believe me/but you won't let/ those robots eat me!\\") The second part is a funny instrumental, the actual conflict itself, punctuated by Yoshimi's bloodcurdling shrieks and the sound of those destructive pink robots.<br />If you can't handle music that stretches the imagination, then this isn't your album. Some songs (\\"Do You Realize?\\") would fit easily into a different album. But many of them (\\"All We Have is Now,\\" \\"Yoshimi Battles the Pink Robots Pts. 1 and 2,\\" \\"One More Robot/Sympathy 300-21\\") have that slightly fantastical, science-fictiony feel. The music is fast and deftly-performed, with the surreal notes that the lyrics demand. The overall effect is fun, catchy, sweet and sometimes quie funny. (The only distracting element was the cheering and applause)<br />Most albums leave you unsatisfied, craving something indefinable, but \\"Yoshimi\\" didn't do that to me. When I finished the last track, I just hit \\"play\\" again and listened to the entire album a second time. Highly recommended, a pleasant quirky piece of work.quirky piece of work.
0782008372|3.0|OK, it's not a fantastic movie (although there are plenty of hard-core fans who will tell me otherwise) but I do like it, even though I only give it 3 stars.<br />Let's start back in the 1500's with the birth of a simple man who only wants to lead a simple life of farming and children.  Some things never work out.  Connor MacLeod is an immortal, one of a rare breed of beings who can only truely die by having his head seperated from his body by a naked blade in battle.  The problem - there are many others like him who wish to do just that in an effort to control the prize and possibly the fate of the world.  Well, in this movie there's just the one who decides to renew the chase in New York City 400 years after their first meeting.<br />The film follows Connor from his first days of learning what he is in Scotland, to an infamous sword dual in colonial America, and concludes in a fierce fight to the death in NYC.  Along the way we meet the people Connor meets and integrates into his extraordinary life.<br />Christopher Lambert does a fine job as Connor, and of course Sean Connery his is usual self.  I personally feel Clancy Brown is great as Kurgan, the fearless warrier whose mission is to become the last of the immortals, and whose joy is making Connor sweat.<br />Sword fights in this film are pretty good.  A little bit of romance that it probably could have done just as well without.  The story has a nice flow to it, bouncing back and forth through time at the appropriate moment to explain certain aspects.<br />DVD features are fairly typical.  Director's commentary, behind the scenes photos, some (supposedly never before seen footage) and a slew of production stills.<br />Photographic quality is excellent.  Sound is Dolby Digital Surround.  This one isn't the pick of the litter, but it's a good film nonetheless.
B000069HKH|1.0|It is really surprising to see that this album has been rated so highly. I am a long time fan of Bruce and this album was a serious letdown. Bruce is not - and should not be - a &quot;storyteller&quot;, nor should he get too political. He should produce good rock'n'roll music. So few can accomplish that these days, and I had been hoping that Bruce would put his considerable resources to better use than this. Mary's place is a gem though. As fo the album as a whole, I listened to it a few times, then gave it up and put on one of the Live 75-85 albums, which is the true Bruce.
B0000683DH|4.0|I'll admit right now that I'm writing this review as a fan of the series and movies.  That being said, let's talk about this movie.<br />Star Trek II is a continuation of a Star Trek original series episode titled &quot;Space Seed&quot; which introduced us to the villian Khan (Khan Noonian Singh played by Ricardo Mantalban).  Having seen this episode of the series is not a prerequisite for understanding the movie, but would probably make seeing the movie a little more enjoyable.<br />The basic premise is that Khan was beaten by Kirk 15 years ago and now he's after revenge.  Since Star Trek is about space travel you can bet that this time the two won't be slugging it out like Foreman and Ali which means fierce space battles.<br />A sub-plot is that Kirk comes face-to-face with his son he hasn't seen since his birth (presumably - I'm not sure they mention it) and the mother of his child who wanted Kirk to stay away.  This plays along with Kirk's uncertainty about his place in life and the way his life could have been.<br />The production included on this DVD is likely different from what you will recall seeing in the theaters or on video.  It has some slight scene alterations and a few extras that were only shown in the past on television.<br />Technically speaking the movie employed special effects that were state-of-the-art during production.  However the movie was released in 1982 so don't expect your socks to be knocked off, although the effects are far from lacking.  For a film that is over 20 years old the picture quality is quite good.  And if you have a suitable surroud sound system then you'll find the intense sound effects drawing you in.<br />This DVD is a cut above the original DVD release (which I purchased before I knew the collector's edition was even in the works).  This one includes an audio commentary by director Nick Meyers as well as a text commentary by Michael Okuda (which focuses on the more technical aspects).<br />A second DVD included contains numerous cast interviews and production information as well as the trailer.<br />My bottom line on this movie is that if you like science-fiction, you'll like this one.
B000002N3N|5.0|This album is wonderful. Enya's beauty voice is what makes it so wonderful. THe memory of Trees is a great album of many. I love almost every song. My father had her cd's that is how I found her. I remember hearing her music as long as I can remember, especially as a child. Now I have all her albums but 1, Shepard Moons, My father has it. Which album is unique in a different way. The memory has many great songs like the title song ,Anywhere is, Athair ar neamh, China Roses and more. The memory of trees is worth buying. I Give it 5 stars, and nothing can change that.
B00005YW4H|4.0|I listened and the more songs I heard, the more I enjoyed her stylings. Her voice is different, but she carries it well. Now I see what all the buzz was about.<br />Yes, I say buy it. Yes, it is worth it.<br />Give it time to grow on you too.
B00006CXSS|4.0|This is an amazing series and well worth the imposing price.  The quality of the film and the acting are outstanding!  There is drama as well as realism.<br />Unfortunately, there is a sort of tunnel vision which afflicts the entire series.  I understand that it is seen through the eyes of one specific company and its surrounding regiment and division, but the average American viewer could easily watch this series and form the impression that this division (or maybe special types of troops such as paratroops or rangers) won WWII for the good ol' USA.  This is especially true if one watches this series with the other Spielberg\Hanks Collaboration- Saving Private Ryan.  I don't mean to split hairs or detract from the incredible bravery of these men, but unfortunately in over-glorifying one unit in a country that learns history through exposure to popular culture, the greater accomplishments of other less glamorous types is sad.<br />The untold truth is (and there is a passing mention of them as \\"doggies\\" in BoB) that the leg infantryman who slugged it out in the ETO made possible our victory as did his counter parts in the forgotten Armored Divisions- SIXTEEN of which fought in Europe.  The 101st was not alone in Bastogne!!!  A combat command of the 10th Armored Division was there with them.  Why are they NEVER mentioned?  The only picture we see of regular infantry in BoB is rag tag soldiers retreating through the bulge in a daze.  Leg infantry divisions suffered upwards of 250% casualties after being committed to combat.  Divisions like the 1st,3rd,4th,9th,28th and 29th suffered between 150-250% casualties and were almost never taken out of the line- unlike the much vaunted \\"elite\\" 101st. Just don't forget the hundreds of thousands of \\"doggies\\" who went through the meatgrinders of the hedgerows and the Huertgen.
B00005R2M3|5.0|I had never heard of Shakira before she released this cross-over English album, but it took less than a second for me to become a fan.  I first encountered Shakira's name atop a list of most popular videos and wondered who in the world this performer was.  The Whenever, Wherever video totally blew me away; I admit it took a couple of viewings for me to get past her beauty and all of those amazing little moves and shakes she has perfected, but pretty quickly I realized that the song in and of itself was addictive.  Soon I was watching both the English and Spanish videos of the song, eagerly awaiting the moment when a CD full of Shakira's music would find its way to my stereo.  As someone not very familiar with Latin music, this album brings a whole new type of sound into my world, and my appreciation and interest in this style has grown immeasurably as a result of my buying this album.  My respect for Shakira likewise grew in leaps and bounds as I learned more about her, such as the fact that at 24 she not only wrote or co-wrote all of these songs but also produced them, as well as the fact that she was already one of the most popular Latin singers in her part of the world.<br />There is a lot of variety to be found on this album; alongside traditional Latin stylings, Shakira incorporates elements of Spanish, Arabic, and even good old American rock and roll music, melding all of these influences into a sound that is uniquely her own.  Laundry Services offers up nine English-language songs, two Spanish tracks, and the Spanish versions of her two biggest hits.  Now I wish I hadn't forgotten all the Spanish I learned in college, but it really doesn't matter all that much.  Listening to Shakira sing in her native language is mesmerizing and provides a much clearer example of her unstoppable musical talent.  Her English songs are great, but clearly she is more comfortable singing in Spanish, and the opportunity to listen to two great songs in both of their versions can be pretty illuminating.  Whenever, Wherever pulses with obvious pop appeal, and it alone certainly earned Shakira this particular fan; its Spanish-language version, Suerte, is even more enjoyable.  Underneath Your Clothes is a nice ballad that offers up the softer side of Shakira but fails to communicate the immense talents she has at her disposal.  Tengo is a song that may not appeal to everyone, but I think its strong tango introduction makes for a great beginning of this cross-over album; closing the album with the Spanish-language version of the song, Te Aviso, Te Anuncio, is an equally nice and symmetrical touch.  The One is another excellent ballad, while The Fool is a song that I would definitely release as a single; these two songs rival Whenever, Wherever as the best tracks on the album.  Poem to a Horse is a rocking little number that belies its rather timid-sounding title.  I don't know what Shakira is saying in Te Dejo Madrid and Que Me Quedes Tu, but I certainly like how she is saying it.  The one and only song that comes across as a little weak is Rules, but I would like to say for the record that I personally would have no problem following any rules that Shakira might require of me.<br />This album isn't perfect, and in some ways it is a fairly unusual crossover album.  Shakira's newly-learned English is not perfectly understandable at times (but the liner notes do contain all of the song lyrics) but her voice always resonates the beauty and passion and incredible talent she carries inside her.  The Spanish tracks serve an important dual purpose - assuring her long-time Latin music fans that she has not abandoned them for the US market and allowing people like me to get an understanding and develop an appreciation of the incredible Latin music we have been missing out on all these years.  Shakira has it all as far as I'm concerned, a true musical artist with a commitment to her career and to her fans all over the world that will assure her success formany years to come.r many years to come.
B00000JSPE|2.0|I guess I got completely swept up in my new love affair with Robbie Williams.  I really was excited to order this retrospective of music of the band that help shape and mold the funk/pop/sex-god/in-yer-face Robbie Williams into the master of Escapology.  Nothing on this CD remotely reminds me of Robbie.  All I can say is thank God he was able to escape with his talent!  Not only is the music here sappy (and, believe me, I expected that to a degree) but the recording is weak.  I have to turn the levels up on my system so high that when I play any other CD the volume scares the hell out of me.  Weak songs, weak voices, weak harmonies and a weak recording make for an investment I regret.  I do enjoy owning, if not listening to, the peppy remakes of \\"How Deep Is Your Love\\" and \\"Could It Be Magic\\" so I guess it's worth the two stars.
B00005JLEU|5.0|First I saw &quot;Kiki's Delivery Service&quot;; Wow. Then I saw &quot;Princess Mononoke&quot;, Outstanding! Then I saw this; this film is about 100 times better than any of the newer Disney films, Walt would be racing to hire Miyazaki if he was still alive. This is a perfect children's film: it will ignite their interest and imagination and the hand drawn animation will fascinate their parents as well.
B000002R48|3.0|This album is great musically, anything that these masterminds  Portnoy, Petrucci, Myung, and Moore released is trully artistic(including the latter lineups).The downside to this album is Charlie who really makes this album hard to listen to. His vocals are a bit to annoying to set through the whole CD. Its great to add to your collection of Dream Theater, but something you may only want to put in your stereo every once in a while. If James Labrie was on this CD it would have been a killer album. But sorry Charlie, he really makes this CD very unbearable to listen to. I guess that is why most Dream Theater Fans classify Images and Words as their true debut or atleast I do. But hey, there is some awesome tunes on this album if you are tone def to the vocals.
B00005JLRT|3.0|This was the worst even-numbered Trek film made. It should have been MUCH better, since it is supposed to be the last STTNG film. <br />Better space battles, better story, better ending. <br />The &quot;climactic space battle&quot; was lackluster: Is that the best a Soveriegn class battlecruiser can do?? &quot;We're out of torpedoes&quot;?? Hoo-boy! More ships would have been nice too. I won't spoil the ending, lets just say it made me somewhat upset. I did like the new federation shuttle though.
B000067JBN|5.0|Yes, we know the story, and yet this has a charm all its own. Passion, a mortal pushing against the immortality of time to rescue a tragic lost love. Even conquering time cannot bring her back, nor heal his broken heart. And yet he hurdles through the centuries like a comet. At the end he meets the Terrible, head Morlock who can sift through his mind, every memory is there for his viewing and study. His question is answered, She is lost and cannot be recovered. To set the world right our time traveler takes on the Morlock and expunges him and all those with him. He destroys his time machine and lives and loves those he finds in his present time. Who has not lost a love and who would not be haunted at the thought of traveling back to retrieve her? Who would unlock himself from his own time and charge headlong into the future and past to find her, to save her? Great Flick !
B00009TB5G|5.0|The Two Towers is a very complicated story. Fitting it into three hours can make some scenes seem a little rushed to those who have read the book (such as myself). That is my only problem with the theatrical edition. I really don't care about any of the changes (except maybe Aragorn falling off the cliff) because I understand why the makers made the changes, unlike \\"Tolkien Purists\\" who have not a clue the challenge of transfering a huge book with such a complicated plot to a 3 hour movie. Anyway, to the point, it was around 30 minutes added to the Fellowship on the Extended Edition. But this year, we are in for a bigger treat as 43 minutes will be added on to The Two Towers in the Extended Version. This edition will make the movie so much better as it will feel less rushed. I will, however, rent the theatrical for all the features that will not be included in the extended extras.
B000084T18|1.0|Generic hip-hop.  50 Cent is merely coasting on his notoriety for being shot 9 times.  Not much to build a career on, but he has nothing else to work with.  Consider the following: <br />1) He is a poor rapper.  His rapping style is exactly the same as Mase (who I also despise), meaning it is boring, void of all emotion, and monotonous, not to mention his irritating mushmouth syndrome.  ENUNCIATE!  <br />2) Tired material.  Good lord, haven't we all heard this material a million times before, by a hundred different rappers, almost all of whom did it better?  If you don't have anything new to say, just do us all a favor and don't open your mouth in the first place.  <br />3) Tired image.  Rappers wallowing in an image of drug dealing, strapping gats, and mysogyny is overplayed and rather trite these days.  Yet, instead of coming up with an original image, 50 is once again beating a dead horse, just like everything else in his \\"career\\"... somebody else did it first, and did it better.<br />I think it is painfully obvious that if not for Eminem and Dre, 50 Cent would not be anywhere near a recording studio.  He doesn't deserve to have a record, considering how depressingly unimaginative it is.  If recycled, paint-by-numbers hip-hop is your thing, by all means buy this waste of plastic.  But if you want something original in your hip-hop, do yourself a favor and avoid this like the plague.
0790731479|5.0|I love this movie! It is probably one of the best movies ever made, written, acted, and filmed.<BR>Tim Burton, is literally, a genius. To create such a dark, gothic world in this film, with great dark humor, and great charactets must have been fun<BR>Danny Elfman even brings more spirit to this movie as the composer. Some of his most famous composed songs are in here (The Beetlejuice theme).<BR>Winona Ryder does a terrific job as the sad, gothic daughter Lydia, who has to move with her parents to the country. Her parents don't understand her, no one does, until she sees ghosts in the house. THe previous owners, by the way, want these people OUT! So they find a bio-excorcist named Beetlejuice to help them.<br />10 out of 10! A perfect movie!
6304383177|5.0|A side-splitting farce about stuffy zoologist Grant and his confrontations with madcap heiress Hepburn. As the psychiatrist<BR>says in this picture, &quot;The love impulse in man frequently reveals itself in terms of conflict.&quot;, and he couldn't have been more right. Grant and Hepburn team up in this film for the third, but not the last time and the result is hilarious! This is a great picture with Hepburn inadvertently(?)making a shambles of Grant's life and somewhere along the way they end up falling in love. The help of a marvelous supporting side cast: a pompous big game hunter, a wealthy aunt giving away a million dollars to the most likely candidate, and a leopard named Baby sent to Hepburn from her brother Mark who lives in Brazil are what makes the film come together. AQ hilarious movie that I highly recommend.

0783225857|5.0|This is a charming, slice-of-life tale about a young girl coming of age in a small town in 1930's, post-Depression<BR>Alabama. Based on Harper Lee's novel of the same title, this is a gem of a movie with the dynamic characters Scout, her brother,<BR>Jem, and their father, Atticus, played by Oscar-nominated Mary<BR>Badham, Phillip Alford, and Oscar-winner Gregory Peck, respectively. Raised by their widowed father, Scout and<BR>Jem must struggle their way through adolescence and face the <BR>trials and tribulations along the way. One of which being a court case of a black man convicted of raping a white woman.<BR>Though he is obviously innocent, his chance at being acquitted seems hopeless.Also a strange, reclusive next-door neighbor named Arthur\\"Boo\\"Radley who is played by a very young Robert Duvall whose experience in the movie was his first film debut.<BR>Though only seen for about three minutes in the movie,his influence on Scout and Jem's lives is very great.Being one of my favorite movies, this is one you won't soon forget.
B00000JCOV|5.0|Slipknot is a brilliant album. If you like pure metal then buy this CD. From grinding of guitars and double bass drumming in the songs Surfacing and Me Inside to the repeated phrase in 742617000027, this album is pure oringinal and perfect for all of you metalheads out there.
0440237688|4.0|This book makes us wonder if anything is perfect. In this book, Lois Lowry eloquently describes Jonas in the search for truth within a seemingly utopian community. Everything in this amazing book means something. The name Jonas comes from the name Jonah, meaning peace. But why would Lois Lowry have a character search for peace in utopia? Lois Lowry's epic about the dystopia within a utopia will leave you shivering, yet wondering.
B00005JL7Q|4.0|Co- produced by Robert De Niro, and executive produced by Nick Hornby, who wrote the novel on which the movie is based; ABOUT A BOY is a comedy drama which manages to avoid falling into the sentimentality tar pit.<br />Will Freeman (Hugh Grant- delivering another good performance after his acting stretch in BRIDGET JONES'S DIARY) is a man in his late 30s with no adult responsibilities at all. His life is all work and no play, an enviable barrage of fast cars and casual sex; but when Will is befriended by a geeky 12 year old boy named Marcus (Nicholas Hoult) after Will saves him from being beaten to a pulp by school bullies, the pair gradually form a special bond. For the first time, Will learns the importance of thinking of other people's feelings and needs; and as a result of this new friendship Will who lives with his strictly vegan mother (Toni Collette), another one of those left-wing \\"Meat is murder\\" clowns; gets to eat meat as well as being exposed to other delights he has been sheltered from like profanity laden music; as well as earning a healthy dose of self-esteem; which in the end nearly proves to be his undoing...<br />Hoult and Collette both give excellent performances as well. ABOUT A BOY is by turns sad and funny. My only complaint is the typical Hollywood quick fix ending, which is totally unrealistic. But that's just Hollywood, isn't it? Well worth a gander.
0671027344|5.0|I have never read a book that touched me quite as much as the perks did. I have read it four times and never fails to take my breath away. Charlie is the most complex, interesting, wonderful character i have ever encountered in a book. This book tugs at every emotion in the most delicate way. Its beautifully, devistatingly hopeful and you definitely come away from it feeling differently. I did atleast. I think that everyone, from adolescent to elderly should read this book and i hope that it touches their life like it did mine.
B00008WG3U|3.0|In the many years that NOFX have been playing and recording albums, they have written songs that will be forever branded in my brain.  This is because they rock so hard.  Such great albums that have induced this branding include &quot;So Long...&quot;, &quot;Punk in Drublic&quot;, and &quot;S&amp;M Airlines&quot;.  The new album, however, does not make me quiver or give me goosebumps.  One knows NOFX has a great album when one listens to the whole thing from start to end on full volume without blinking an eye.  But for this album, I have to turn down some songs because they are annoying, and I don't care to listen to the whole thing straight through.  This album does not make me think as much as their others have compeled me to.  What is good about this album is the NOFX signature riffs and palm-mutes that keep me interested in NOFX as a band.  There are some truely come great parts in some of the songs.  Fat Mike has an undying ability to perfectly place lyrics in a unique way over the music.  That keeps me listening to this album.  I would recommend borrowing this album from someone and buying their other albums.
B00003CXAW|5.0|A wonderful experience: the 90-odd minutes rocks along with all of the suspense and excitement you'd get from any Crichton wannabe, and the stop-motion animation on the gorilla is quite outstanding: the special effects team did labour the point a little (there were three longish set pieces between Kong and a prehistoric animal coveting Fay Wray), but King Kong's final scene atop the Empire State Building is tremendously affecting.<br />As is Wray's performance throughout: she is a sultry, brooding, juicily erotic presence while all the men about her are losing their heads and focussing their testosterone on what to my eyes was quite the wrong target!
0441003257|5.0|This is the best book ever. I never thought Daouglas Adams could be displaced of that title, but it's happened. I read it in less than I day, I couldn't get enough! Everyone on the face of the planet should read this, including you. Buy it, and be sure to heed the author bios. *nudge*
B0000024UO|5.0|the only thing that would improve this album would be a mullet on his head.  kit basom loves johnny, despite that.  but seriously, this is good music, kidz.
B00005OAA6|5.0|I'll admit it, I initially bought this album because Victoria (a.k.a. Posh Spice) is David Beckham's wife.  I had heard &quot;Not Such An Innocent Girl&quot; before and really liked the song.  When I got the album, I mostly listened to the first track (and first single off of it).  Little did I know, what a spectacular, honest, and fun album it really was.  It took me awhile to get used to some of the songs.  Now I have listened to all the tracks multiple times and I can truly say, Victoria Beckham is extremely talented and her first solo album reflects it.  I love, love, LOVE all of the songs.  They are just phenomenal, with great beats, great lyrics, and GREAT singing.  I think Victoria put a ton of effort into this album and it shows.  Many of the artists that we know here in the U.S., are extremely unoriginal in what they sing and what they sing about.  On VB, not only are the songs spectacular, but they actually have meaning.  As I said before, I completely adore all of the songs but perhaps my favorite is &quot;Like That&quot;. It's just such a catchy song, with a good beat and clever lyrics.  I also love \\"Midnight Fantasy\\"... God I love all of them!  I think the record label made a mistake not releasing it in America.  I think that this album is more U.S.-oriented than Forever by the Spice Girls.  Songs such as &quot;Like That&quot;, &quot;A Mind of It's Own&quot;, and &quot;I Wish&quot;  would have made great singles here.  I tried &quot;A Mind of It's Own&quot; out on a couple of my friends and for the rest of the evening, they were humming it.  From the sweet ballad &quot;Every Part Of Me&quot; dedicated to her son, Brooklyn, to danceable tracks such as &quot;Whatcha Talkin' About&quot; and &quot;Like That&quot;, this album just explodes with energy and creativity.  Victoria's true potential just jumps out on this record.  I continue to enjoy this album beyond belief months after purchasing it and I am looking forward to Victoria's sophomore album!
B000002MY3|5.0|Ever since I bought this album back in 1996, I've been a fan of Alanis Morissette ever since. Virtually every song on this album is worth listening to. Some of my personal favorites include: Ironic, You Outta Know, Head Over Feet, You Learn, All I Really Want. Just to name a few:) So, for anyone who enjoys great music racked with a good deal of raw emotion, this album is definitely for you. You might also want to check out her latest album, Under Rug Swept, for more great music.
B000003TA2|4.0|An excellent major label debut from the good old Sonic Youth.  &quot;Dirty Boots&quot; is one of my favorite songs of all time...it's timeless...worth the price alone.  You can see the influence of some of these songs on later alternative acts such as Nirvana and Trail of Dead.  WOnderful songs such as &quot;Dirty Boots&quot; &quot;Tunic&quot;, &quot;Mote&quot;, &quot;Titanium Expose&quot;, and &quot;Dissappearer&quot; are are brought down by some half-baked ideas....like &quot;My Friend Goo.&quot;  Still, even after owning many of the 80's and 90's Sonic Youth Releases, this album is one of my favorite Sonic Youth albums.
B00005JLXE|5.0|After last years success of Spiderman, teenagers across this great nation anticipated another teenie bopper movie.  After leaving the movie theater at the end of Daredevil, these teenagers said the movie, \\"Was awful\\".  I asked them why it was awful, but they couldn't come up with a legit excuse.  This movie was 10 zillion times better than Spiderman.  It was dark, and touched on personal subjects.  This showed Daredevil, as just a man.  Anybody who said this movie was awful, should probably stick to the feel good movies like Spiderman.
B000007638|3.0|(Note - this review is NOT for the 2013 remastered version!).  This was an awesome live show on the original 3 LP version.  Somehow the transfer to CD resulted in substantially inferior sound.  I don't know if they didn't have the master tapes available or what, but the quality of the CD sound disappointed me.  Also the [price] is too much; I realize that's not Amazon's fault, but at that price they should have given this the deluxe sound treatment.  I think the weak sound must be why this isn't available as an American issued CD.  Ok, all that aside, it's a fantastic concert, great setlist, etc.  If this is as good as it gets, fine - buy this and enjoy it.  But it could have been a lot better than this, I know the LPs sounded much better.<br /><br />EDIT - Please note that I wrote this review about an older version of this CD set.  This review is NOT about the 2013 remastered version (deluxe or standard 2 CD).  I haven't heard the 2013 \\"Hear Music\\" version; some people here are saying it sounds a lot better than the old EMI one (which I reviewed), some are saying it's still a bit lacking compared with the old LPs.  Amazon is combining all reviews together, old versions and new, which makes this confusing. I NOW have the Japanese 3CD, \\"mini LP\\" version of several years ago (not to be confused with the Japanese 2CD version, which apparently does not improve the old EMI sound) and that sounds very good, very near the original LPs in sound quality.  So I'm not spending more money on this new release.  But I hope it (2013 \\"Hear Music\\" version) sounds great, for those who do buy it.
B00006F2TV|2.0|sniff sniff, whats that smell?  Oh that is the smell of teenagers.  Can anybody tell me what this wonderful comic became?  A teenie bopper movie.  The CGI wasn't that good either, I mean there were tons of flick flubs with the cgi.  Whats up with the organic webs?!!!?!!!!  Don't get me wrong, I did enjoy this movie.  I just don't think it deserves the credit everyone is making over it.  Personally, I think the reason everyone enjoyed this movie was that they needed to feel good about New York city again.  Obviously it worked.  That is why I also feel that Daredevil was not given the time or day.  It was dark, and New York was referred to as, \\"hells kitchen\\".  Giving New York the feeling of being dirty again.  Now don't get me wrong.  Spiderman made me feel great about New York again, but once I let everything settle down, I saw the movie again.  I realized that the movie wasn't that good.  It was good, but not how everyone makes over it. I probably should have given three stars, but I wanted to draw attention to my post, and I'm too lazy to change.  Should you purchase it?  Yes, but don't worship like its the best thing in the whole entire world.  Then go see Daredevil!!!
B000088E6D|1.0|This guy doesn't even have a good voice...and this album is on Warner? No, actually it's not. It's on 143 Records, distributed by Warner Brothers. For some reason, the CD jacket states Buble is 25, and he's 30. <br />When will music speak for itself again, instead of all of this non-sense?<br />The album is a waste of my time, and yours. Anyone of us could have jumped into the studio, and if this guy is the next Sinatra, as his handlers call him, then I'm Sammy Davis.<br />And I'll bet Buble doesn't even know who he is.<br />This album smells of unfounded ego, and after seeing the guy on the TODAY SHOW, it has become increasingly obvious that we all must still await the best of them to come, because this guy isn't it.<br />Maybe I'll catch him at the karaoke bar, because there are far better singers there on a Monday night.
B00008J2DQ|5.0|over the years, many good hard rocking bands have risen to give us a dose of heaviness in a time of blandness. but those bands usualy fall as fast as they appear. not so with godsmack. their first album was strong, and catchy, but many were quick to label them as a temporary act, going to dissapear tomorrow. then awake came, even heavier and catchier. and now, faceless. the best thing i can say about faceless is this...up untill the realease of faceless, master of puppets has been my all time favorite cd. i never dreamed it possible that a cd could come along that would grip me, entertain me, and leave me begging for more. but godsmack have done so. now all the metallica fans are gonna hate me, and say godsmack ripped off metallica, whatever! godsmack has a sound that is unique to them, and though you can compare them to other bands, one thing you cant do is call them rip offs. this cd has been in my player since it came out, and will stay there for a long time
B00005B36H|5.0|Tool is my favorite band and, in my mind, the best band. Lateralus only further proved that point to me. If you don't already have this CD, get it! It kicks royal booty.
B000056K04|5.0|I am a HUGE DMB fan and have seen them live 15 times as of this writing.  When I heard the first single, &quot;I Did It,&quot; I liked it but was a little apprehensive about how the public would react to it (remember when Metallica came out with Load?).  Some fans liked it, some fans didn't like it, and it attracted new fans.<br />Of course, I went out and bought it the day it was released (as I have done with every new DMB release since Before These Crowded Streets in 1998).  I enjoyed it, and after listening to Everyday and only Everyday for about a month, I started to listen to my other DMB albums as well.  I still liked every one just as much as I did.  Recently, I listened to all the DMB albums back to back and came to this conclusion:<br />Everyday is a solid album.<br />Sure, it sounds more produced than previous works, and Dave plays some electric guitar, but it still sounds like a DMB record, and unlike anything else.  There are plenty of great songs on here, both acoustic and electric.  The opener &quot;I Did It&quot; is not their best song, but still opens the record with a bang.  &quot;The Space Between&quot; is a classic DMB ballad, and always gets the lighters up at the shows.  &quot;When The World Ends&quot; is classic DMB, with the lyrics sort of  &quot;spoken in tune,&quot; almost as if Dave is having a singing conversation with his lover.  &quot;Mother Father&quot; with Carlos Santana is a definite highlight here.  Even the worst track on the album, &quot;Sleep To Dream Her,&quot; isn't all that bad.  &quot;Everyday&quot; is basically the live classic &quot;#36&quot; with new lyrics and more music written to it, and is very enjoyable.  &quot;Fool To Think,&quot; &quot;Dreams Of Our Fathers,&quot; and &quot;So Right&quot; all have great riffs.  &quot;What You Are&quot; is vintage DMB, especially when played live.<br />All in all, this album does not stand in comparison with the likes of Before These Crowded Streets or Remember Two Things, but Everyday is a great record in its own right.  Would I recommend it to anyone?  Yes.  Would I recommend it to hardcore DMB fans?  Absolutely, I am one, I should know.  But just as with Metallica's Load and Reload, listen to this album with an open mind, as something on its own, which every record by every band is, and don't compare it to previous efforts, you will find that a very enjoyable record lies beneath all the talk and comparison.  I'm sure we all enjoy a good record, so let's help make this record an enjoyable one by doing as I said, and the record definitely is a different, but enjoyable listening experience.  Sure, it sounds different, but it still sounds like the Dave Matthews Band.  What I wanted was a new Dave Matthews Band record, which I got, and I was left satisfied.
B00005ASOC|5.0|Finding Forrester is a movie about a young, talented, African-American teenager who becomes friends with the most unlikely person.  His name is Jamal Wallace, and he is a student in a public school in the Bronx. He loves basketball with great passion, and plays with great skill. He has a secret passion though, which is writing.<br />Forrester is a reclusive , rather old white man, who stays in his apartment permanently. He has shunned modern day society, and lives a life of reading and spying with his binoculars and camera.<br />Basketball provides the link between Jamal and Forrester. Eyeing the pickup games that Jamal and his friends play, Forrester becomes a mysterious figure in the teenager's eyes. They have heard strange stories about him, such as him murdering someone.<br />Jamal's friends dare him to sneak into this reclusive man's apartment. Surreptitiously breaking in at night, Jamal is startled by a scream and runs off, leaving his backpack.<br />If you want to learn how this unlikely friendship between them develops, I suggest you watch this movie. It's a very emotional movie, and a movie that inspires. It shows how one young black man's determination and talent brought success. I especially liked this movie because I like basketball, and reading. This movie has something that everyone can relate to. It's also a realistic movie, which is refreshing considering all the movies out. With an all-star cast (Sean Connery, Rob Brown, Anna Paquin) and a great storyline, this movie is sure to delight.
B00008J2DQ|5.0|Everyone of their songs on their cd's are amazing i dotn knwo what it is about it but it makes you keep on listening i've had their cds for years and i still listen to them over and over again. Sully Erna has an amazing powerful voice and is good at anythign he sings cuz i've heard some covers of other songs that Godsmack does and they are awesome. they had their new cd faceless come out on 4/8/03 and sold many many copies i can see why.

0688163173|3.0|I'm a big Dennis Lehane fan, but found this this book to be very confusing.  I started skimming the first half of the book. None of the characters really grabbed my attention. The second half of the book was suspenseful with some really good twists. The book had redeemed itself in my eyes until the last two pages where there seemed to be yet another twist which took me days to figure out. If you are a true Lehane fan, I would recommend the book, but if you are starting out with this author, read one of his other (much better) books. True Lehane fans don't expect too much.
B000002J27|1.0|I loved this album when it came out on LP in 1976. I owned an import copy on the Charisma label, and the sound was warm and solid. This remastered CD has horrible sound. Not 'bad', mind you, HORRIBLE! There is no bass, and the highs are exaggerstaed beyond belief, accentuating sibilance to the point of extreme irritation. DON'T BUY THIS CD! Try to find the older version.
B000002H4Q|4.0|Being a hella huge Cure fan, I can honestly say that this cd is good. Of course, this is only my opinion, and it is somewhat biased. ALthough, on this cd, Robert gets in with poppy stimulus. I enjoy bopping around to this cd as I clean or just to get my in a good mood. It is completely on the other spectrum of Faith and Bloodflowers, but just as good. Enjoy!
0066620996|5.0|It is refreshing to see that fundamental values and deep commmon sense are supported by so much data coming from the few large companies that actually enjoy enduring success.  It's a pie in the face of the super-managers.  What a revolution if these recommendations take hold in the industry and Wall Street! <br />From Level 5 leadership (humble, servant, people oriented, etc.) to the hedgehog concept (the simple concept of the business) the findings in this book make a lot of sense.  Now somebody publish the field book to show how to start on that path.<br />People looking for quick fix, abstain.  Others, buy this book and leave it on your boss'desk, and your boss' boss desk.  The more people read it, the better everybody will be.
B00006LJ79|5.0|When I heard 'All the things she said' the first time, I thought they're horrible, but then I had a stab with that album. I can say that it was one of my best decisions for the reason it's brilliant;<BR>1.Not Gonna Get Us- energetic and poetic song about runing away. It tottaly makes you feel the environment of the night and the motorway.<BR>2.All The Things She Said-I prefer the russian version of this song because it has better lyrics<BR>3.Show Me Love-It's the kind of song which you can really yell. Good to listen, good to sing<BR>4. 30 Minutes- romantic, soft and very emotional<BR>5. How Soon Is Now? - This is the worst song on this album in my opinion, no wonder, because it has got no russian version<BR>6. Clowns (Can't You See Me Now?)- My favourite song, which has the features of a hard-rock and a very melancolic melody. Blockbuster(kind of a MUST LISTEN type)<BR>7.  Malchik Gay - Light song about a boy who doesn't like girls. Too light for me, but has a good rythm.<BR>8. Stars - Skazy Zanchem or Zanchem Ja- The Russian versions are much better both in lyrics and in music.<br />If can say I'd recommend the Russian version of the album for everyone because it is much more enjoyable(maybe because they are Europians also) Russian is a marvellous language, and is worth learning or just listen to it. <BR>p.s.:Don't forget to listen to their new single, which they are performing at Eurovision Festival, called 'Ne ver, ne bojsia, ne prosi'( Don't be afraid, don't be desperate, don't extinguish)
0920236162|5.0|A Princess who goes to great lengths to rescue and save her prince to find out he is nothing but a schmuck in the end.  This is a great gift for teenagers who are at that stage in their life where they will go to great lengths to please those that they date and they do not always turn out to be princes in the end - you occassionally kiss a frog or two!
B00005JLO2|1.0|i have to say that this was one of the worst movies i think i have ever seen! why on earth were two americans cast in leading roles where they were required to don false british accents when there are PLENTY of talented brits who could have done a much better and much more believable job? the premise was stupid; the actors were undeniably nice to look at but were so heavy handed with their parts that it was impossible to take them seriously. i will say that it was an absolutely beautiful film to watch (muted) in parts, but overall it was awful. the score was also way too intrusive and got in the way with the little decent acting that could be found. i cannot tell you how tired i am of seeing &quot;the noble savage&quot; showing &quot;the unenlightened westerner&quot; the path to personal redemption as well. really a terrible, heavily cliched film.
B000002UB3|4.0|There are moments of convergence when it speaks beyond the musician's experience and reaches something universal.  You can hear it at moments in Abbey Road.   For anyone living through the Beatles' era, it is impossible to separate the music from the stories - of their breakup; of Paul is Dead. It's all here, and it informs the recording.  Beyond these stories, there is magic, of something transcendent.
B00008976Y|5.0|If you woke up realising the cruel deprivation of all your loved ones so that everything you treasured appealed to you as \\"traps\\", with their funerals taking place when you're still lying in a hospital bed severely battered-- how do you describe such grief? So this movie a full expression of grief, as it's title Blue\\" suggests.<br />In this indescribable numbness and physical pain, is there anyone she could turn to? Her mother whom she sought to get some consolation had nothing to offer, as she herself is a victim of senile dementia faintly pointing out that as a child she was perfectly happy. Her nana instead wept and profusely too in a dark corner. Silently she gave her a hug and asked her why? Because you don't cry was the answer. ( It's somewhat like the  Heifetz, the violinist's playing, just like a tordado !! )<br />She chanced into a promiscuous neighbour who also went to into a number of crisis. First the residents of the building were turning her out to be saved by her last vote. And then her father came as an viewer in one of her pornographic shows, whereas she had to resort to her late husband's colleague's physical comfort.<br />Yes, she escaped into an estranged town, diving into the water, swimming what not. But history, or at least memories of history, was repeating itself.  The street flutist played her tune and one early morning she found him sick laying by the gutter. And the mouse having begot a host of youngs in her kitchen getting right into her nerves. She didn't have the heart to dispose of them as it reminds of her own fate so much. She tried to move again but in vain. Eventually a cat has to be introduced...  It was too much pain, self-inflicted or otherwise... These are all facets of her grief.<br />Suddenly, she realised that she was not alone in her sufferings. She was kept so far in the dark that her husband had a lover, a young and pretty lawyer, even pregnant with his baby. So, she was not the only woman whom her husband loved. Jealousy, perhaps.  But out of her kindness and generosity, she gave part of her husband's estate to this future heir of her late husband. Perhaps the news came as a shock, perhaps she felt that she was no longer alone or at least not in her pain and hence her existence?  But this belated straw on the camel's back came and at last made her cry ...    <br />So her husband was an internationally acclaimed composer whom she assisted a lot. But music was duly given a low key here in the movie though in a way it spoke loud as it's so evocative. The colour blue instead reins supreme in this movie.
B00003W8NM|5.0|This movie was just awesome, too much for words.  The whole movie i was thinking something totally different from what was really going on.  I love helena bonom carter too.  She made that movie perfect.  If you havent seen it, i highly recommend that you do.
B00004XONN|5.0|This must be one of the best synthesizer albums to date.  Its unique keyboard sounds and Thom Yorke's haunting voice give it the best blend.  It's a step away from their previous efforts: &quot;Ok Computer&quot;, &quot;The Blends&quot;, and &quot;Pablo Honey&quot;, which are heavier rock oriented.  Their unique sound on &quot;Kid A&quot; seems to allow Thom to voice his expressions a lot more personally than before, and I have tremendous respect for that.<BR>     Honestly, when I first listened to &quot;Kid A&quot;, I hated it!  Then about a month later, I listened to it again, first half one day, then the next half the next day.  Listening to the first half, I still hated it but not as much as before.  Then after listening to the last half, I was hooked.  Immediately, I listened to it in whole, I was hooked to the whole thing!  If you're not used to a sound as unique as theirs, your response may be the same as mine.  If you stay with it and be patient, you will not be disappointed.
B0000399WI|5.0|this was a great film, and I really love Morgan Freeman. It was messed up though that he had to go to prison for something that wasnt his fault, but in the end it was good that he did, because he learned alot more, and made some good friends along the way.  I highly recommend that you watch this.  ITs very moving and impowering.
B000002UJQ|5.0|This is by far the best alternative album I've listened to!  Their twists and turns on their tracks will keep you listening and keep you curious to what will be next.  &quot;Paranoid Android&quot; especially proves this with their soft rock sound turning to a hard rock sound in various parts of the song.  Their signature experimental sound is a departure from their previous work: &quot;The Blends&quot; and &quot;Pablo Honey&quot;.  When you listen to &quot;Ok Computer&quot;, you won't only be amazed, but you'll also be influenced!
B000050FEN|5.0|great movie, with a twisted plot. I just couldnt believe what he did though in the end.  Creepy...just a tad<BR>watch it you'll like it
B00004TDTO|4.0|**** ½ <br />Who hasnt heard of Jaws?  From the legendary theme from John Williams to the image of a monstrous shark approaching from the depths, Jaws is a classic, a legend, and a masterpiece.<br />In case you havent heard the story, Jaws focuses on Martin Brody (Scheider), the hard-working chief of police on Amity Island.  After a girls mutilated body is found on the beach, Brody calls in oceanographic scientist Matt Hooper (Dreyfuss) to examine the body and tell the town whats happening.  Whats happening is that a monstrous great white shark is looming in the waters, driven by some unseen force.  Now its up to Brody, Hooper, and certifiable sailor Quint (Shaw) to track the beast and kill itbefore they kill each other.<br />Jaws has all the elements of a masterpiece.  Spielbergs visionary directing is, as always, outstanding, driven by a bubblegum-story-turned-action-packed-masterpiece script (phew!) by Benchley and co-star Gottlieb from Benchleys exciting best-seller.  Who can say enough about the great cast (including a classic performance by Shaw), not to mention the perfect score by Williams?<br />Jaws is the type of film youll want to watch over and over again.  The fast-paced action, complete with likable characters and even some lightheartedness just adds to the experience.  Even you havent already seen it (how could you not?) than drop whatever youre doing and watch it now.
6300214753|5.0|I laughed my butt off watching this video.  It is full of humor from beginning to the end.  Especially when Ferris uses his computer to produce bodily noises for phone conversations.  There is a hilarious scene showing the garage attendants going on their joyride in the sportscar.  This film is great for any kid who always wanted to get back at administrators.
B000069AUI|5.0|Buying the Coldplay CD was the best thing I did in awhile. I saw them in Philadelphia just as their first album was released and it was an aweseome experience. The CD really grew on me and was added to my bin of favorites. Then came along A Rush Of Blood To The Head. This has to be one of the best CD's of the decade. Songs like Warning Sign and Scientist are masterpieces. Amsterdam is another beautiful song. From start to finish the piano keys pound and Chris's voice drenches you in thoughful tunes that any fan of music can truely appreciate.

The best Limp Bizkit CD, the only one I occasionally listen to. Get it if your after Limp Bizkit.
B000089RVX|5.0|This is the best album i have bought in the last 20 years!        i now have bought 3 copies! it is hard to explain, but i must hear the captivating voice of Amy Lee    over and over, the music and lyrics hit you in the face and in your heart and soul,i cannot listen to this CD without having a box of tissues.unbelievable! i can't wait for their next album.
1563898586|5.0|This is a great story set in the late 1800's. Campion Bond recruits 5 people to perform a special mission. Allan Quatermain, Captain Nemo, Dr Jekyl/Mr. Hyde, Mina (formerly Harker) Murray, and the invisible man. The five are sent to capture the cavorite, an anti-gravity device that allows flight to vehicles. But they soon learn they have been betrayed and now have to save London.<BR>The characters go perfectly together. Mr. hyde is just a savage ape, the invisible man is insane, Captain Nemo hates everyone, Mina is annoying as hell, and Quartermain is addicted to opium. <BR>This book is perfect except the conclusion seems too short. But none the less you should read it.
B000089RVX|5.0|Need I say more? Amy has one of the most beautiful, haunting, amazing, poignant voices in existence. She could make the phone book sound interesting. It's the sort of voice that echoes again and again through your head days, weeks, months after you've heard it. I know that it has through my mind.
B00005B36H|5.0|Indeed as the title says, this latest tool release is, to sum it up briefly, grunge and art-rock mashed together with an amazing result. I think this is my favorite Tool album, though the others are all very good, because it has such astounding depth where each member of the band has a vital role in every song. From beginning to end this is a masterpiece. Although it may at first seem daunting when the shortest song on the album is a little under six minutes long, each song fits together with the next in an elaborate network of emotion and strange philosophy bound together within rock, so you won't realize how long you've been listening. Hypnotic and raw - well worth the listen.
0385335482|5.0|Sophie Kinsella definitely knows how to describe a shopaholic. The novel &quot;Confessions of a Shopaholic&quot; is an emphatic read for any woman who possesses the obsession of spending money like the main character, Becky Bloomwood. This novel had a comic background to it by depicting all the ways Becky Bloomwood strives to get out of debt. Despite all her efforts, she just pulls her self in deeper and deeper into the black hole of debt and soon realizes that she won't be able to escape. Becky's endeavors are very capricious to the reader and will have them snicker with disbelief. Sophie Kinsella places Bloomwood in all realistic places in England such as the \\"tube\\" and her flat in Fulham so the reader has localities to relate to as well as imagine. Kinsella has also done a superb job in giving characteristics to Bloomwood. For instance, even though Becky is a financial journalist, she is in major debt from her spending money on \\"necessities\\" at elite stores such as Denny and George and Harrods. To put it simply, &quot;Confessions of a Shopaholic&quot; by Sophie Kinsella is a notable read for anyone who cherishes the world of shopping.
B0000029DD|5.0|On \\"Grace\\" every song is a masterpiece that only gets better with each listen. There is not even a throw away LYRIC throughout this CD. The musicianship and Jeff's vocal abilities are PHENOMENAL.  The DVD \\"Jeff Buckley - Live in Chicago\\", is equally as good.
B00005JLRT|4.0|I've read the other ... reviews prior to buying this DVD, and I agree with most every one. I must say that if you are expecting The Matrix or Star Wars, this movie might not be for you. It is, after all, Star Trek - a show known not necessarily for special effects and action scenes, but for the real tug-at-your-heart storylines. I admit that before I went to see the movie, my opinion was already tainted by the movie reviewers, and I also admit that when I first saw this movie in the theatre, I was bored and did not like it one bit. The fact that I was in a non-digital, non-THX moviehouse has a lot to do with it, I'm sure. The picture overall was dark and it was a very unenjoyable experience as far as movies go. With that being said, I take all of that back now with this DVD release. The visuals are stunning, the colors are brilliant, and the acting was up to Next Generation standards. The special effects will blow you away. The plot was suspenseful and very enjoyable. The DVD extras add to the overall experience as expected (Makes me reconsider waiting for the DVD in the future, instead of going to the theatre!) Being a die-hard \\"Trekkie\\", I rate this movie four stars instead of five only because I have seen Star Trek TNG episodes on TV that, on occassion, have been better than the movies.

B00008CLOA|5.0|This release has been remasterd from the original tapes iusing Sony's latest digital stream technology, which is supersior enough for SACD discs so the regular CD player can benefit too, and it does.<br />The over quality of the sound from this disck is better that I have ever heard before, so much so it's like a new album. You can hear the band as a whole, the keyboards, drums, brass and are more prominent and with a clarity that enhances the entire CD. Even if you have a copy of DSOTM and enjoy it, all the more reason to buy this.

Ramotswe, how fortunate I am in this life; at every moment, but especially now, sitting on the verandah of my house in Zebra Drive, and looking up at the high sky of Botswana, so empty that the blue is almost white.  Here she was then, Precious Ramotswe, owner of Botswana's only detective agency, The No. 1 Ladies' Detective Agency-an agency which by and large had lived up to its initial promise to provide satisfaction for its clients, although some of them, it must be said, could never be satisfied.  And here she was too, somewhere in her late thirties, which as far as she was concerned was the very finest age to be; here she was with the house in Zebra Drive and two orphan children, a boy and a girl, bringing life and chatter into the home.  These were blessings with which anybody should be content.  With these things in one's life, one might well say that nothing more was needed.\\" (Page 1)<br />So begins Alexander McCall Smith's latest book, THE KALAHARI TYPING SCHOOL FOR MEN.  He has a wonderful African storytelling voice.  Parts of the book are funny, sad, educational, and touching.<br />Mma. Ramotswe deals with real and moral problems. Although the troubles take place in Africa, they are universal and range from searching for people from the past, cheating spouses, looking for love, raising children, trying to improve one's financial status, trying to right a wrong, to dealing with competition, and more.<br />I enjoy the way Mma. Ramotswe solves her clients' problems as well as her own. There are no guns or high-speed chases.  There is no fighting, cursing, or the likes. An element of danger and adventure exists in Mma. Ramotswe's work but the detective uses her wits and manners when dealing with others.  The plot is always refreshing.<br />I love the way THE KALAHARI TYPING SCHOOL FOR MEN transports me to Mma. Ramotswe's world.  I feel like I'm a part of the detective agency.  I feel like I'm riding with Mma. Ramotswe in her little white van along the Botswana plains.  I feel like I'm sharing a cup of red bush tea with her and Mma. Makutsi.  I feel like I've tasted a slice of the cake that Mma. Potokwani always serves Mma. Ramotswe at the orphanage.

B00004VWA7|5.0|Jaco is without a doubt the best bass player I've ever heard. He could have wiped the floor with Cliff Burton, Steve Harris, Jason Newsted, and any other bass player you can think of, plus a few solo guitarists I've heard. Besides being the Yngwie Malmsteen of bass, minus the ego, Jaco's lightning-fast riffage and the use of both right and left hand harmonics make listening to this cd both an educational experience and a trip. If you aren't blown away after hearing the first track, I doubt you know anything about music at all. I wonder how far he would have gone if he hadn't pulled a Jimi Hendrix.
6305603847|5.0|I had seen The Wall at a younger age and didn't appreciate it fully...until now.  This was a big-budget movie with a great story/acting/cinamatography to further enhance Roger Water's brilliance!...  For serious Floyd fans, the DVD includes excellent bonus features such as R. Waters interviews and an inside look into the making of the movie.  - I watched the whole thing twice in a row the day I got it!
6305265666|4.0|Drew Barrymore actually did a marvelous acting job in this retelling of the Cinderella tale.  This DVD includes a good cast, unexpected twists in the familiar plot, and a soundtrack that I heartily encourage you to purchase as well.<br />Barrymore's portrayal is sensitive, believable, and disciplined.  Pairing her with Anjelica Houston, whose malicious interpretation of the evil stepmother was scary, was a lucky stroke.  The conterplay between these two characters captures the attention and hold its to the end.<br />Of all the \\"chick flicks\\" I have been, um, priveleged to view with my wife, this is one that I would not mind seeing over again.  Worth your time.
B00007BKVC|5.0|I didn't get an opportunity to appreciate this movie when I first saw it on the big screen. First, I was stunned by the ending. Then, with all the media controversy surrounding this movie I didn't know just how to feel. I watched this film again on DVD after all these years and loved every minute of it - including the ending.  Now, I wonder what the fuss was all about. It's a funny, buddy road movie with some serious overtones. I loved it so much that I watched it thrice in a weekend (twice with the audio commentaries turned on). Every character in this film is fully developed and superbly acted. The cinematography and Ridley Scott's direction are fantastic. The only beef I have is with the second audio commentary on the DVD - with Davis, Sarandon and Khouri. I wish Khouri was miked; she is inaudible in most of the movie and barely audible in the rest.
B00005JL95|5.0|When I began to see the trailers for this movie, I thought it looked extremely dumb.  But when I went to see it in the theaters, I was Amazed and completely thrilled with it.  It is one of the best cartoon movies I have seen in my life!  It is also very emotionally touching, considering I cried atleast half the movie when I saw it for the first time! The characters are so adorable, especially Lilo and Stitch, mainly because of the creative drawing techniques used for this film.  The story is very strong, heart-warming, and relative.  It is a must-see, no matter what your age is!  It has the laughs, the action, and the emotions, all in one happy little bundle of joy called LILO &amp; STITCH!  I couldn't wait to buy it when it came out on DVD &amp; VHS so hopefully you'll not wait a moment longer to buy it yourself. Enjoy!

B000059HCN|5.0|Few movies leave one actually thinking afterwards, this is what makes this movie stand out, aside from the fact that it refuses to censor the dreary underground world of a junkie.  To add to this film's morbid appeal, is a cast that breathes life into the desperate characters-and makes them real to the audience.  To tie it all together are fantastic film techniques, and a haunting musical score.  What else is there to say?  This film is not for the squeamish, but for those with open minds and a taste for innovative films. Kudos to you Aronofsky.
B00005KB9X|4.0|This is a first class Marley album with great production values, thumping beats, clicks and shrieks, great songs, and everything that you would expect from a great Marley album. I think my favorite song here is So Jah Seh, a delightful hymn to Jah, which must be delightful, come to think of it, for me to recommend it, as normally I am no fan of gospel music.<br />My only quibble is with the version of No Woman, No Cry, which is surely recorded at the wrong speed as the tempo is absurdly fast and Marley sounds like he is on helium. This is not as far fetched as it might sound, as it was recently discovered after many, many years that part of Miles Davis' much acclaimed album Kind of Blue had been at the wrong speed all along.<br />I solved the problem here by making a copy of the album with the wonderful version of No Woman, No Cry from the Live! album and now I have an even better CD.<br />Still, this is another of the great Marley albums and definitely worth getting, helium or no helium.
076790592X|5.0|Life is beautiful. However, we often get so caught up in mere existing that we forget that how beautiful and precious life really is. We are like the way Mitch Albom used to be, going about our day to day routines failing to think about the truly important things. Then something happens, tragedy strikes in some shape and form and we are forced to get back to living.<br />That's what happened to Mitch Albom when his college professor and advisor, Morrie Schwartz, became stricken with Lou Gehrig's disease. After finding out about his old teacher's illness and how serious it had become, Albom began making weekly trips--on Tuesdays--from Michigan to Massachusetts to meet with Morrie and partake in the last class Morrie was ever to teach. It was a class unlike any other and Albom was the only student. The subject was both simple and profound: life. And from that, TUESDAY'S WITH MORRIE was written.<br />TUESDAY'S WITH MORRIE, like life itself, is both simple and profound. The book is beautifully written and often reads like poetry. In less than 200 pages, Albom shares insights that are full of a lifetime of experience. This is a great book. It is a book that can change one's life and even though I don't agree with all of Morrie's lessons and beliefs, I did learn a thing or two and am a better person because of it. Well worth reading.
B00005YW4H|5.0|In a time when music is populated by Britney Spearses, N'Syncs  and similar \\"phenomenons\\", I think it's amazing some people will take their time to write and say low things about Norah Jones. What's the point in engaging in a discussion to find out if Norah Jones is or is not a jazz singer? It seems to me it's completely useless, not to say idiotic, to try to label someone with Norah's talent for singing and making music. Nora Jones has a tremendous gift, which is to sing. No one can deny that. Her voice (already labeled as \\"smoke and honey\\") is sweet, powerful, fluid. Her easiness when singing is amazing.<br />Some people want to compare her to Billie Holliday, Ella Fitzgerald. What for? Norah Jones's music is now. Holliday and Fitzgerald were fifty years ago. Yes, their music is still good and actual, that's why people keep mentioning them. But when someone compares Norah Jones to those past jazz singers, they don't give Jones any chance. Jones' career just started. Let's see if fifty years from now people will bring Norah Jones in their conversations. I think they will. Narrow-minded past-lovers are simply ridiculous.<br />And to say all her songs look like the same, all sad and boring? C'mon! \\"Come away with me\\", \\"Don't know why\\", \\"Bessie Smith\\" and \\"Nightingale\\", just to mention a few, are excellent to listen in any situation. Their melody and harmony provide the listeners to interpret them in any way they want, and to feel anything they want when listening to the songs.<br />...P>Grade 9.4/10

0808581945|5.0|I had first heard about this controversal novel through the constant padories and tributes of the film adaption. I wanted to see the film for a long time, but it soon gave way to me reading the novel before I saw the film.<BR>Please note, the book and film are TWO COMPLETELY DIFFERENT VERSIONS. In best intrest, I suggest reading the novel and igorning the film. Kubrick's version is a wonderful peice of work, but I felt robbed of that feeling I had after I had finished the novel, so I regret seeing the film.<BR>Onward, shall we? The plot deals with a teen rebel named Alex, who, along with his gang of \\"droogs\\", terrorize the streets of London by raping, killing and barging into homes of those whoever they wish. Suddenly, Alex is left in abandonment by his friends and is arrested in a failed break-in. He is sent to a faclity to undergo a radical experiment inwhich he is \\"reprogramed\\" into a model citizen. <BR>Burgess' novel is grand and explores the meaning of a person's personalty and well-being. He also states the questions Is it right to control a person's personality and his free will; as well as the set up of such a program, is is right to do so? While the vocabulary is often confusing and can leave the reader dumb-founded, Burgess based it on the slang of the British and the Russians, which has promted many to formate their own lists of translations, which are proven helpful.<BR>The novel left me amazed and pondering those questions for the longest of time. If you are looking for a good, thinking man's novel, this is a must read.

0393317552|5.0|Wow. This book should be required reading for every person of European descent (and everyone else too). Fascinating and gripping. It makes fantastic use of the wealth of data newly available on the origins and prehistory of humans to present a convincing theory of how societies arrived at their current arrangement. Thoughtful and humane but also unflinching in its descriptions of our tribally-based cruelty toward other humans. Really amazing vignettes of scenes from human history, Pizarro's encounter with and destruction of the Incans being a obvious example. A great antidote for racism.
B00005JKQZ|4.0|Halfway through, I didn't like it, but the second half changed my mind. <br />I couldn't understand why Russell Crowe, with his Australia accent, was cast as Nash, who was from West Virginia.  That was very distracting.  They couldn't hire an accent coach for Crowe?  His Princeton roommate had a British accent, which was equally puzzling.  Sure, a roommate from Britain is plausible, but it had nothing to do with the narrative.   <br />I didn't like the beginning of the movie because I felt it was glorifying obnoxious, anti-social behavior.  I felt the message was that it is OK to act like a jerk, as long as you are brilliant.  <br />I liked the second half better because it showed Nash as troubled and someone to be pitied.  I felt the portrayal was very compassionate and empathetic.   <br />My favorite scene in the movie occurs when Nash, his wife, and the psychiatrist are sitting together around a table.  Nash had been out of the hospital for a while.  He stopped taking his medication, and as a result had a recurrence of his delusions.  Nash explained that he stopped taking his medications because they prevented him from doing his work.  After all his troubles, confinement and medication, he still insisted that he could solve his problems with his own mind alone.  The shrink for his part explained that the problem was with his mind.  I found it interesting because it showed (much better than my description here), Nash both being conflicted as well as trying to take control of the problem.<br />Ed Harris's film noir portrayal of a cold war secret government agent was outstanding.  I was mesmerized by the elegant beauty of the actress Jennifer Connelly, as Nash's wife, Alicia.  I wish the film had gone into what attracted her to him, just a little.  I found her to be very cool and stable minded.<br />The bottom line of the film is that mental illness can happen to anyone, no matter how intelligent or talented.  The movie also showed the importance of patience with such people, as well as the importance of love.   It is a movie worth seeing.
B00005JLR2|1.0|I had high hopes for TREASURE PLANET.  I knew the $140 million animated epic bombed on its theatrical release($38 million gross) but I figured it was probably just bad advertising and promotion.  and the DVD would reveal itself as a gem.  I was wrong.<br />This is a bizarro adaptation of Stevenson's Treasure Island.  It mixes futuristic sci-fi elements with 18th century props.  The idea of adapting Treasure Island into a set-in-the-future race to a Treasure Planet is a good one, but co-directors Ron Clements and John Musker's ill-conceived execution of this concept derails early on.  These guys missed the boat by light years by trying to force a pointless retro future look and numerous, tired Disney formulas into their vanity production.  Admittedly, the images are often stunning, but that alone does not a picture make.  ...
B000050IE6|5.0|The \\"cult\\" following of Opeth have declared this album one of their greatest, if not the greatest, masterworks.  I concur wholeheartedly.  This is the 4th Opeth album I have purchased and with this release,  the pieces fit more magnificently than ever.  I really have no background in death/ dark metal.  I just enjoy quality music and enjoy talent wherever it can be found.  I do enjoy the death metal grows found in their albums, however I don't think they would be so compelling without contrasting them with the soft vocal/ acoustic passages.  The results are explosive in power. This band's live show is awe inspiring. They have taylor made a style of metal that mixes, and even transcends death and classic metal. From what I have found, they truely are the most brilliant band in metal.
B00005JL96|3.0|Finally Disney breaks out of its tiring animation rut with a story about a destructive alien adopted by a troubled orphan girl on Hawaii. No wicked uncle, no comic sidekick, and a refreshing break from the tried-and-true animation style that worked for Disney through the '90s but has fallen flat in recent years. Kudos also goes to the studio for the Elvis soundtrack and the addition of a couple fantastic songs by Hawaiian peformer Mark Keali'i Ho'Omalu. Sure beats another tired Phil Collins or Elton John hatchet job.<br />Unfortunately, these points are overshadowed by a heavyhanded story that crams the square peg of an ugly duckling fable into the round hole of a kid trying to find her place in the world. Apart from Lilo (Daveigh Chase) and the social worker (Ving Rhames), the voices are mediocre. While Dreamworks gets top talent like Steve Martin and Rosie Perez to do *secondary* roles in their animated movies, Disney largely settles for second-tier actors in this one. One alien mad scientist speaks with a Russian accent. Why? I'm not sure.<br />The movie is also violent, and I agree with one reviewer here that the characters are often just mean to other. I am not a prude by any means, but I was a tad alarmed at what they allowed in this film. In one scene, the little girl Lilo gets in a fight in which she pounces on another girl and very graphically punches her in the face. Shortly thereafter she gets in a screaming match with her older sister in which they hurl insults at each other. While this is hardly R-rated or even PG-13 material, it was enough to give me pause about the effect on my 18-month-old son.<br />Another gripe is the near-total failure to make use of the Hawaii setting, certainly one of the most gorgeous locations an animator could ask for. Apart from one surf scene and a chase involving space ships at the end, little is seen of the islands. Contrast this Spirit: Stallion of the Cimarron (another Dreamworks film, incidentally), which made liberaluse of its wild west setting to show canyons, fields, mountain ranges, rivers, etc.<br />That's what I think. But what about my 18-month old son? He actually loves it, and has been his preferred viewing for more than a month now! He walks around saying \\"Aliens!\\", and loves it when we recite snippets of dialogue or hum the music. It does have enough action and color to keep his interest even now. But I'm still keeping an eye on him during those fighting and yelling parts...
B000002MTU|2.0|If you like/love the blues like I do, it's hard to get enthused about this effort. It is not bad, but is still a long way short of other releases.( DAVID GOGO,COLIN JAMES,MARK MAY,GERRY MOORE,VINCE CONVERSE,JOE BONAMASSA,RORY GALLAGHER,ROBIN TROWER to name a few) White boys can play the blues as long as they don't try to rip of the originals, and add a bit of originality.<BR>Originality seems to have left Eric after the CREAM years and his mediocre blues output keeps him fed while he feeds of his legend status. This is a case of legeng status being kept alive by a good PR machine and record companies that are milking a golden cow.(how many best of's can you produce)In the face of so many superior CD's why would you buy this????
0385335482|5.0|This book will really tickle you.  Becky Bloomwood is a hilarious character who is obsessed with shopping.  As her bills pile higher and higher, she gets into more and more trouble.  These books are just so funny! The thing you have to understand if you want to like this book is that she has a problem and she isnt really shallow...just kinda bubbleheaded.
B000002UA0|3.0|Pink Floyd used to be Sid Barrett's band, and he wrote 9 of 11 on Piper by himself, and the two others with the rest of the band.  What you think of the album depends on what you think of psychedelic music.  &quot;Astronomy Domine&quot;, &quot;Pow R Hoc H&quot;, and &quot;Interstellar Overdrive&quot;, are dark complicated songs that bear repeated listenings.  &quot;Lucifer Sam&quot;, &quot;Matilda Mother&quot;, &quot;Flaming&quot;, &quot;Take Up Thy Steth&quot;, &quot;The Gnome&quot;, &quot;Chapter 24&quot;, &quot;Scarecrow&quot;, and &quot;Bike&quot; are simpler songs with more childish lyrics -- they have more of a novelty value.
B00006LI4S|5.0|The sound quality and picture quality is the best I've heard and seen in a DVD yet. The accustic guitar sets in particular are crystal clear and give me goose bumps.<br />I'm a huge Pink Floyd fan, and this DVD (Where's the soundtrack Mr. Gilmour?) is close to my favorite performance to date. I think it's important to point out that after playing the DVD to several friends who are not necesarrily Floyd fans, per se; they all agreed that this DVD is definately one to add to the collection.<br />In short, if you're here looking at this DVD and reading this review, stop what you're doing and buy it NOW! You will not be disappointed.
0688163173|4.0|U.S. Marshall Teddy Daniels and his partner, Chuck Aule, arrive on Shutter Island, a secure facility for the criminally insane in Boston Harbor, to investigate the mysterious disappearance of Rachel Solando from her locked and guarded room.  While looking for Rachel, a woman who has murdered her three children, Teddy also plans to investigate rumors that the hospital is performing radical brain surgery as part of its experimental treatments.  He has a secret personal motive for this trip, however--to find the arsonist who started the fire in which his own wife died, a man believed to be incarcerated on the island.  As Teddy and Chuck begin their investigations, with a total lack of co-operation from the hospital staff, the worst hurricane in thirty years bears down on the island.  If the power fails and the generators don't kick in, the electric locks and electrified fences will no longer protect Teddy, Chuck, and the staff from the hospital's murderous inhabitants.<br />In the hands of a lesser author, this might be the setup for a melodramatic and gore-filled pot-boiler, but Lehane artfully creates and maintains a tension-filled atmosphere, full of foreboding, without giving in to the easy temptations of sensationalism as his plot becomes more and more complex.  At one point, Teddy describes his fear, as a &quot;sparrow's ghost, pass[ing] through the center of his chest and flapping its wings,&quot; a unique metaphor which epitomizes Lehane's vibrant prose and makes it a lot of fun to read.  The hospital's orderlies have &quot;deadened faces, as if they hadn't been fed enough as babies,&quot; and Teddy, in trying to grasp a partial memory from the past, likens it to a &quot;melody he was trying to remember while the radio played a completely different tune.&quot;<br />Lehane's characters, Teddy and Chuck, are simultaneously tough and vulnerable, able to attract the sympathy of readers because they are so normal, in contrast to the devious hospital staff and the murderous patients.  Dialogue is snappy.  Revelations come slowly, and are constantly thrown into doubt by later revelations, which raise the suspense. As the tension grows, the &quot;sparrows' ghosts&quot; begin flapping their wings faster and faster.  This is a well-written can't-put-it-downer, with a story full of unexpected twists and turns, deceitful characters, life-threatening danger, and a blockbuster ending that will satisfy anyone looking for a novel that is out of the ordinary.

B00005JKJA|5.0|There isn't much I can possibly add to the discussion of MD, except to echo the praise and appreciation for one of the most masterful films ever made. This and Blue Velvet are the two David Lynch masterpieces. Period.<br />However, I write mainly to express my deep frustration with the MD DVD and the Mickey Mouse approach to its production. Mr. Lynch has been quoted as saying he didn't want chapters on the DVD because a film should be seen in its entirety. OK -- I've already seen MD start to finish six times. I rented the DVD so I could try to break down the film scenes and analyze them in detail (this isn't some Julia Roberts flick that you can figure out in your sleep). But the simplistic DVD format used here IS AN INSULT to any serious film lover because you make it more difficult, not easier, to watch the film repeatedly for increased appreciation.<br />Lynch developed a similar cavalier attitude at the height of \\"Twin Peaks\\" when he and Mark Frost made it clear that not everything had to be wrapped up so neatly on the show and that audience confusion was OK.The result was that his fan base deserted him for a decade and the best work he could get was \\"The Straight Story.\\"<br />So I pray The Powers That Be will rethink their strategy and give us a DVD worthy of this unique and amazing piece of cinema.
B00006CXSS|5.0|Television as a medium takes a good deal of criticism for basically being intellectual garbage devoid of anything good.  200 channels and nothing to watch just is as common as it is ironic.<br />Band of Brothers changed that for me.  This DVD set is a must for anyone who is interested in military history or simply a compelling story.  Truth is stranger than fiction.  It is also more compelling.<br />The 10 episodes are generally good but there were one or two that I did not think measured up to the rest.  Each was directed by a different director and took different views of the events from the book.  With each episode being somewhat encapsulated by this, yet the series is basically, chronological.  In turn this makes the 600 or so minutes of program go through many emotional and stressful change ups.<br />My personal favorites are the first three episodes and the holocaust episode.  The first two do a great job of setting up the company and the individual men.  The thirs is D-Day and does an incredible job of showing how terrible and confusing combat is.  The Holocaust episode I thought was one of the strongest though.  It was simply a fine example of soldiers coming across a concentration camp and not knowing exactly what it was about.  The horrors and atrocities speak for themselves and are very much put into the context of the episode rather than preaching the obvious facts that Nazi's were despicable.<br />From a production values perpective, Band of Brothers is incredible.  Watching the \\"making of\\" really illustrated how much effort went into the show.  There were a few minor technical issues, like red telephone boxes in WWII UK (those popped up after the war, according to a Brit friend watching along with me).<br />Band of Brothers is worthy of any DVD library and one of the best things to be shown on TV that was not a sporting event.
B000069AUI|4.0|Coldplay have managed to make one of the best album of 2002. Good songwriting and musicianship. The production is also good and lyrically it is more interesting then Parachutes. <br />Many people didn´t think that they were able to follow-up the 5 million selling ultra-hyped debut but they certainly did with this album and in many cases much better album it is more stabled there are no fillers etc.<br />Unfortunately it seems that Chris Martin is getting so much attention these days that not many people would like to focus on their music and for example him being in these awful VH1 shows about most sexiest and elligable Bachelors and stuff has helped to ruin Coldplay´s sucess not to mention that Chris is now the star of the band and the others are just musicians helping him out which it wasn´t like before. However a good album. Well done Coldplay but don´t start doing anything silly.
0743216458|5.0|Band of Brothers turned out to be one of the best things to appear on television.  It also did justice to the book and the men the book was about.  The book is better.<br />Reading Band of Brothers is immersive.  I read it in 2 sessions in a hotel room while stuck in St. Louis on a business trip.  RAre that I had the downtime, but rarer that I could spend that much time doing nothing but pouring through the book.  The truth is far more compelling than fiction and this is one of the best small scale WWII non-fiction books to be published.<br />Band of Brothers stands well as a companion to the TV mini-series as both have slightly different perspectives.  If you have read or watched one and not the other...get off your duff and correct that!
B000063S6Z|2.0|A Decent album with decent material but nothing else. Moby has become one of the most annoying musicians in the music industry to day and there is no wonder why everybody has gotten sick of him. This album sounds exactly like Play and most of the songs are just so boring just like he is in real life. Please try to make good music and stop thinkin if MTV is going to play your videos. Moby ranks with Eminem as the most boring and most unentertaining artists in the music business today thanx.
006092988X|5.0|When I first picked up A Tree Grows in Brooklyn, I had my doubts about it, since we had to read it for highschool, and we don't always read the best books for school.  However, with every page that I read, I became more absorbed in it.  It thoroughly described the hardships that Francie Nolan had to go through while living in the poorer parts of Brooklyn in the early 1900's.  All the sad things that Francie had to put up with, all her fun times, and all her problems just touched me so much.  It made me realize how lucky I am, how lucky we all are, to be living in such a time as this, with so much more fortune.  It touched my heart as much as my grandparents' stories of the old country did, like Grandma Rommely, Francie's grandmother, had described (excepting that I did not come from Europe as they had).  It was an amazing book, and I would recommend it to anyone who likes a good book.
