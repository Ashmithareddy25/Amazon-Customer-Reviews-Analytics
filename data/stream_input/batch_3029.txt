B005K17RU0|3.0|Very good app. Love it on my kindle fire. Keeps me up to date with the weather in my area.
B00D48BT5A|5.0|Bill Bryson writes the most interesting books. His knowledge about the subjects he writes about is extensive. Combined with great writing skills, this book is once again a masterpiece.
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|This is a Great game! Very addictive!! I love how every level has a new challenge, and doing so has kept me interested..
B00FIYGYKS|5.0|Trivium's new record is amazing. It really reflects how all four members have evolved and grown as musicians. While Trivium's earlier albums are characterized by a more raw sound (nonetheless awesome), Vengeance Falls has a much more polished sound that lets you appreciate Trivium's unique sound in a whole different way! Enjoy!
B00DUGCLY4|4.0|This game is like solving a riddle. It is a fun game. Keeps you guessing and entertained. I wish it had free coins fit hints!
B00A6CCF0K|5.0|One of his best, loved every page a real page turner. Will stand on it's own even if you don't read The Shining.
B00A1XOPE8|1.0|The possibility of this being true was worth the time to read.  A bit slow and dull.  Could easily have stopped reading at any time and been okay with not finishing the book
B00CNQ7CRI|5.0|I've been waiting ages for another Bridget Jones book to be released. I must have read the first two 10 times each when I needed a pick me up.<br /><br />I almost did not purchase this book based on the reviews left here. I rarely have the time to read anymore but was curious to know what Bridget has been up to after all of these years. Now I'm grateful I took the chance and purchased it anyway.  I'm only half way through (horribly busy or I would have devoured it) and in my opinion it's the same old Bridget Jones we love but updated to reflect our modern times.  Perhaps those that are giving it a low rating have not read the original two books. Perhaps they are cranky, motherless singleton who cannot connect with the aged Bridget Darcy.  Without giving away any spoilers, if you enjoyed the first two, you will love Mad About the Boy.
B00BESM14U|5.0|I loved Breakfast Club as a teen as it affirmed the teen experience of that day like few other movies did, this is a modern day version of the same and I enjoyed it immensely even as a middle aged adult who now has a 16 year old son.
B007ZGO7EM|5.0|Love it! The numbers are large enough to read without my glasses and the clarity is amazing.  Wish the one on my laptop was as user friendly.
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|Love this game, it is very addictive and fun.  Love the fact that it is know in the Amazon app store.  I play it at the very least daily.
B004SIP9VA|5.0|fun to watch folks learning to dance and always wonderful to watch Richard Gere in action.  Encouraging me to learn more.
B0089LOG02|5.0|I could  not put it down, until the last page was read. I knew of the &#34;orphan trains&#34; but had never read anything about them until this book.
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|I got a kindle and when I found out it didn't have candy crush. oh man, I was heartbroken. But now I can download and I'm freaking stoked.<br /><br />p.s. the tornadoes are horsesheet. seriously change it. how about veggie bombs instead? yes. you're welcome.
B00ESY7QXI|5.0|I'm not a big fan of the storyline just out of a lack of interest in how the early 20th century wealthy lived but this is a great American novel and the movie is done very well. Dicaprio is cast well and they hit a good balance with adding a contemporary spin on it.
B0013TPVGK|1.0|I liked the general ideas expressed in the book about the other elements of music besides pitch. However, the only song named In the book that I could remember was Mustang Sally. You don't need this book or any other if your aspirations are to play Mustang Sally in a nightclub in Nashville. This book seems to be about being a good bass player in a pop band. The characters are all fictions and the &#34;miracles&#34; are fantasy. The author may actually be delusional.
B00CATSONE|2.0|Less about Tesla and more about imagination.  Doesn't seem to be fact-based.  A lot of speculation and guessing.  Wouldn't recommend it
B009FZHYKU|5.0|My daughter talked me into watching The Walking Dead and I started with season one on Netflix. Fell in love with the show so just had to buy season 3 from Amazon as soon as it came out.  It is in my video library so I can watch it from my computer anytime I want. Surprised that I like the show so much and was thrilled to see the beginning of season 4 that started on Sunday, 10/13/13.
B00FFL8ZMY|5.0|Amazon gave me a promotional discount making the final purchase $8.72.  Good price and a REALLY good album instrumentally and lyrically.
B00127RAJY|5.0|I'm almost through Level 1, i am already recommending this video to my friends and family. Jillian is tough and driving you to push through to the finish and &#34;not phone it in&#34;. But it's tough love and i need it. The cardio, the strengthing, the abs. It's all good :)
B0097GVJWQ|5.0|Many different puzzles and hidden objects.  Kept me entertained for weeks.  I liked the story too.  I am looking forward to the second one.
B007C7UZIG|1.0|Who knew to make a game work, you have to buy more games to support the one you want to play.  Error codes throughout the game.  HUGE waste of money.
B007EC27QM|3.0|It is a little bit more than a basic calculator.  It has some features a scientific has, but not enough to be used as a scientific. It does have memory (something all calculator should have) pie, square, square root , but is it the best one out there, depending upon what you might want to use it for will answer that question.  I can not even use it to help with the kids math in school.
B00A6CCF0K|5.0|The Shining was frightening and I hated the movie too scary but this book much better and even though it is scary it is well written and there is a lot of love and a few surprises.  You cannot put down a Stephen King novel.
B005GFPZYK|3.0|The book dragged on. You can only kill so many people in so many pages. Chris Kyle did the job but at what price to him?
B008ALAHA4|5.0|If you own a macbook or a macbook pro that isn't the most recent release, you'll know the joy of forgetting your charger and finding ones that don't fit into the new macbooks.<br /><br />I know its a first world problem, and thank god it isn't a $29 item that's the size of a pinky toe.
B00FRQ32N4|5.0|U already know dis game is that sugar honey ice tea sweeter than a hi c yahoo feel me we here do
B005HEDI3K|5.0|Great acting. Nice to have images & affects remastered. Now, if they could just remaster the fight scenes......ha ha ha
B0064MPXFA|5.0|Compelling storylines. Julianna Margolies is magnificent as Alicia Florick. Each episode is excellent; the entire season's work is highly recommended.
B008YI91HS|5.0|I bought it so I can watch it whenever I want. My favorite scene is when Neil sees his first living dinosaur and grabs Derrn's head to see it. Followed by the real opening of the movie &#34;Welcome to Jurassic Park.&#34; I also love the John Williams theme music.
B001F6TXME|5.0|Using a tripod requires a device like this when taking pictures of yourself with others- it works flawlessly!  It gives you enough distance whereas you can frame the shot so that the use of the cord isn't in the picture- bravo, Nikon!
B00BAXFCPO|5.0|I've been searching for a long time for the answers this book gave me. I was diagnosed with pre diabetes and was told I would need drugs for the rest of my life. I was determined to find a way to reverse my destiny. Grain Brain has the answers and shows you the way to not only reverse diabetes but how to save your brain in the process! I highly recommend it.
B005R32L66|4.0|The app was easy to download and easy to install. It made setting up and getting the program working easy.
B00DGGIXS6|5.0|There's only one Cher, and she came thru again.  Her voice is exemplary for 67!  Love her and the CD.

0316069884|5.0|I recommend you buy and read this book and then pass it to others so you can educate everyone about our serious animal abuse problem we have here in the US. my website [...] The book is well written and easy to read.
B003RT0NK8|4.0|I had never heard of this film and it was recommended by a friend.  If you like space/sci-fi films, this one is worth watching.
B00D3NSDVO|5.0|One of the best books I have read in a long while. The storyline was unbelievable, very well written. Congratulations to Terry Hayes and I look forward to more of his stories.
B001P3SA94|5.0|It was an awesome movie! I really loved all the great music and actors. Plus it brought back the old days music.
B008RA3X5E|5.0|You have everything you need  right on your kindle . I love the features on this alarm clock. It's great for home or travel.
B00BH0VSM6|4.0|Very intriguing  such a frezh unique perspective of Australia and its unique society  Nesbo is an extremely talented writer and anything he writes is a pleasure to read
B00A6CCF0K|5.0|This book is awesome!  I like most Stephen King books, but this one is a &#34;Page Turner&#34;  It is written so that whether the reader is familiar with &#34;:The Shining&#34; or not, you will be drawn into the mystery and it is hard to put this one down.  I recommend this book.
B007IXWL2C|5.0|Awesome book very tented author k does their way with words<br />Read all books in about two weeks couldn't put them down
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|FINALLY available for the kindle! Addicting. Fun. I hope there aren't many glitches to work out but 5 stars it is.
B00DSTBMMU|5.0|Sheryl Crow's voice is beautiful. For her &#34;first&#34; foray in making a country album she knocked it out of the park. From We Oughta Be Drinking to Waterproof Mascara there is something for everyone to love!!!
1594746036|5.0|When I first saw Miss Peregrines Home for Peculiar Children (Ransom Riggs) I thought, 'ooh, a ghost story!' Boy was I wrong. The cover is a bit misleading. No ghosts. :(<br /><br />This book is about 16yr old Jacob, who follows a series of clues that his recently deceased grandfather left for him to find. All his life, Jacob had been told stories of his father's life during the war in an orphanage, accompanied by pictures. His grandfather tells him about peculiar children, who have all sorts of uncanny skills, from a girl with a backmouth to an invisible boy. He also tells Jacob of monsters who stalked him and his friends at the orphanage. Years ago, Jacob had accepted that the man was senile, but when he dies, Jacob thinks he sees the monsters that haunted his grandfather's past. He embarks on a quest to the location of the orphanage where his grandfather grew up.<br /><br />Even though there are no ghosts, the creepy factor is still present. The children are frozen in a time-span of one day, that repeats over and over again. A bomb that supposedly destroyed the orphanage comes every day, but no one is freaked out. The photographs are perfect for a creep- fest.
B005PK553C|5.0|If Shrek were to rate this season, he would describe it as having layers. Layers like an onion. AHS is not for the faint of heart. The progression of this story is simply amazing, and much of the acting is superb for a show of this caliber. You will get hooked.
B002HLM4E0|5.0|Love that we can rent fir tge same price as Redbox or Blockbuster without having to physically return a movie. My daughter will always love Harry Potter!
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|I think this is a great game and I really enjoy. I recommend this for everyone. The movie is great to. This app and  the movies are fun for the whole family!
B00ER23V1W|5.0|Gravity is the newly released sci-fi epic from director Alfonso Cuaron, who previously directed the incredible Children of Men. To help him capture the haunting and intense atmosphere of the film, Cuaron brought the British composer Steven Price (who recently scored The World's End) on-board, and what came with him was a truly spectacular electronic score with some epic, sweeping orchestral sounds.<br /><br />In the first track \\"Above Earth,\\" Price sets the tone by offering some eerie, static-y sounds that move into a somber, electronic orchestra that is just beautiful in ever way. In the second track \\"Debris,\\" the intensity kicks into gear. A viola and electronics make this track stand out at the beginning, sounding very tense and perilous in itself. The third track \\"The Void\\" establishes this intense theme even further, keeping in track with the previous \\"Debris\\" but also offering haunting vocals. It's the second to last track, \\"Shenzou,\\" though that is truly epic and mesmerizing, and the track alone makes this score worth owning.<br /><br />I'll stop there with the track analysis, but I will say, anyone who likes electronic scores will go bonkers for this masterpiece. Now, with other masterful scores released this year (including The Lone Ranger, Europa Report, Elysium, Pacific Rim and Captain Phillips), Gravity does have competition. Happily, I definitely place it on the top 5 of the year, just for being so fulfilling and all-around epic.
B00D7JGL36|4.0|Where can you go wrong with the fabulous Vince Gill, Paul Franklin and that Bakersfield sound?? It's a great tribute to a legendary country sound!!
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|I enjoy playing this game a lot. There is never a dull moment when playing this game. There are always new surprises and levels around each corner! I highly recommend this game for all ages!
B0089LOG02|5.0|I loved this book!.. Historical trip through time ,with characters that keep you glued to the page. I definitely woll learn more about the orphan train travelers after this story.
B0014BY72Q|5.0|Prophetic science fiction novel.  One of my personal favorites.  Read again because these times lend themselves to what may come in the future.
B007GCY8FS|4.0|Standard Reacher. Solid plot that stays interesting and exciting every chapter. Reacher seems to be getting tired. I think he needs to relax and recoup. Great read!
B0091QS88K|5.0|I love this game for my 2 year old little brother, he loves  it and he tells me it is fun. It is so cute for little kids and ads don't really get in the way! If you are looking for a game for your kid this is definitely the game for you and your young child!
B00ESNDQWY|5.0|The writing is still first rate. The acting is as fresh as ever. Sometimes as a series continues the storylines become boring, not The Good Wife. We can't wait for each week's new episode.
B00FFVAJDM|4.0|Another good season so far from a consistently quality show . All the actors are involved in the story lines thanks to a team of writers that has this show well in hand .
0465022227|5.0|This book highlights a good deal of issues that a Ph.D student/ young Post-Doc will face and offers options for nearly all of them. if anything, it should get the reader thinking about his future and how to approach the decisions they will have to make.
B004PHE9F6|5.0|Best auto racing film ever. There are other great racing films but this one is tops. No arguments, clearly the best.
B00DU77QP2|4.0|Loved it, looking forward to the next books. Mixed feels about the ending, but already started into thr second one.

B00E3IZIM0|5.0|Earlier today I watched Cronus, tonight I just finished Pacific Rim, this man knows how to make a movie. There's nothing orginal in the story; Godzilla, Gigantor, Ultraman and many others came first. So what makes this different. 190 million dollars and a man named Guillermo Del Toro, he's a geek and loves this type of thing and this movies reeks of that love. It's also old fashion Hollywood and it's BIG. I first watched it on my 42 inch and it just didn't look right, so I next watched it on my 120 inch, I can't imagine watching this on an Ipod or laptop...it's BIG oh and LOUD. I'd almost believe that if you turned off the sound, you could still hear it! Just can't get over how much fun this has been, I've watched it three times already and I still haven't got to the bonuses yet. Lets not forget the 3d. It's really good on the small scenes (what few there are) and the big scenes, well 3d is great for giving things that deep look, well these frames go on for miles, there's no end and the monsters, wow! One thing I don't understand is the PG13, this is the kind of movie I would have loved at six or seven (that's when I saw my first Godzilla movie). Buy this movie, it's FUN, ENTERAINING and LOUD! It's SUPER EPIC! This man should make the next Godzilla movie, but whatever he does I bet it will be good.
B00E8KLWB4|4.0|There are several different types of puzzles. and challenging HO scenes. Enough hintds/tools to keep you from getting frustrated. Totally addicting!
B00AR85SC0|2.0|I've compared it with a hard copy version and the Kindle one occured to be poorer. There's nothing or very little written about some reaaly important and attractive places. Also reading the maps is difficult - places to visit aren't clearly highlighted. Next time I'll try different series of travel guides.
B000B8L6LI|5.0|I've used the Lansky system for years. Takes a little knack and technique, but it is extremely precise and WILL make your knives like razors! I have to caution people using my knives to be very careful. If you have an 8X lupe (magnifier) you can take a few swipes and then look with the lupe to see if you have the right sharpening angle for that particular knife and adjust the angle accordingly. Once you've established a really keen edge, all you need is to dress them up with the medium stone now and then.
B000YMM3CC|5.0|This has to be one of my favorite movies of all time. I was very touched by the unconditional love and devotion the man had to his wife, even when she was unable to respond because of her illness.
B00CWY76CC|4.0|Fun game to play...somewhat a challenge but keeps u guessing...would recommend this game to others who wants a challenging game
B000FC1PNE|2.0|This series started out great but each subsequent book has gone downhill. This book was so horrible I don't think I could bring myself to purchase any others in the series. The book could have been a novella and ended at 50%. Instead the author drags us along this plodding, boring bath with the main characters dialogue slowly dissolving to \\"she said,\\" and \\"he said.\\" Really terrible book that i had to bribe myself to get through just so I could legitimately review it.
B004EBT6HE|4.0|Entertaining page turner.  Though not in the same league as his historical fiction this is a great entertainment for an airplane ride
B008KOTNVA|5.0|I picked up this set to help me work on my Macbook Air, and because it's a very wide range of security bits that I know will come in handy on my workbench.<br /><br />Beware that it's easy to strip the teeth on the smaller bits.  After tightening down the screws on my MBA twice, I noticed the bit I was using was loosing it's bite.  I contacted iFixit to order a replacement and they sent me a new bit for free.
B00F91RYL8|1.0|This is graphic thumbs up but a storyline choke hold. The graphics are amazingly lifelike, and the makeup was great, bit the story never ends. It keeps changing.
B00EAIMGDW|1.0|after completing the first level, it locked up my phone so completely that I had to pull the battery.<br /><br />If I had a device without a removable battery, perhaps I could have recovered it by letting it run the battery down until the device powered off. Maybe.<br /><br />If the game design, story, art, or play were interesting, it's possible I could forgive the savagely bad coding.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|It's the best to play on a Kindle fire HD<br />You can even play agents your friends on Facebook..................................<br />.
B00FMZ22CM|3.0|I should have paid more attention to the reviewer who got a blank screen when attempting to use this app on the Kindle Fire.  I also experienced a completely blank screen.  I've had my Kindle Fire for about 10 months and this is the first app, either paid or free that doesn't function at all. I wish I could rate it at zero.<br /><br />Update:  After I downloaded the latest version it now works.  However it defaults when opened to Washington DC rather than my location in South Carolina.  I do have my location based service switched on.  I'm upgrading my review to a three.
B00CDTSFF8|5.0|It portrays a totally exciting view of the life of a Viking. The actors are awesome and the scripts enthralling. I highly recommend this wonderful show,
B009JZSC9S|5.0|Enjoy all the actors and the story, find myself pulling for Alisha. It is just fun to watch and I am looking forward to next season.
B0089EHWQE|5.0|What an absolutely beautiful book that was spellbinding!  I felt so empathic with both of the main characters and their families!  I could not put the book down as it depicted so many important issues!  I have highly recommended it to others who have also loved it!  It should be made into a movie!
B00A6CCF0K|5.0|The very best Stephen King story since...well since EVER!! You have to get this and read it right away. Thank you Mr. King, thank you for the story. I enjoyed it...hell sir, my hat off to you, I LOVED it!!
B0061S073A|4.0|would be even more awesome if we were able to use the facebook app with kids place..other then that we have been enjoying it:)
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|So excited I can finally play on my Kindle!!! Love the way it looks!! seems to work better then on my computer!
B008JFUO36|5.0|This movie is a success on many levels.<br />It's visually attractive. It has an engaging plot. It drops you right into the grinder just when you were getting comfy.<br />I like it.
B009LOJK1Q|5.0|Thanks for letting us know what Danny's life has been like, Steve.. This story was just perfect! Buy this now!
B00847KFDS|5.0|Saw John Fogerty perform on the Gentleman of the Road tour with Mumford and Sons...he was amazing and so is this new record. He nails it on every track, whether he's singing solo or with other artists. Highly recommend!
B00B8WXFWE|5.0|I am an original New Kids fan and when I heard they got back together I wasn't sure how it was gonna play out, but their new music is FANTASTIC!  I am so impressed with them.  Keep up the good work NKOTB!
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|So fun I can not believe how fun it is get this game just get it now now now now
B005LAIIMG|4.0|As cinema, it's a top quality movie.<br />As an action flic, it pushes credibility a bit far .. but its a fun far.<br />It wears a bit thin on plot when Brad Pitt attempts a daring solution.<br />They have a bit of a problem trying to weave desperation into a macho adventure approach.<br />Still, while it fails to make it all the way, it is a very good movie and worth watching.
B0002Y69NG|5.0|I am going to start out and say that I loved the entire trilogy. The last 2 films get more hate then they should. OK..now that I have that out of the way. This is a great collection for fans of The Matrix. The films are crisp and vibrant and the sound is top notch.<br />Having the AniMatrix in the set is the icing on the cake. While all different and unique with their own perspective on The Matrix story, it gives you that need to learn more about the complete story.<br />Definitely worth every penny!
B00FEHXCIG|1.0|The franchise needs new writers, better dialogue, fresh plots this 3rd installment was a train wreck; Stan Lee had to be shaking his head.
B0007XT7V8|5.0|The CD of Theory of a Deadman was an excellent buy, as i do enjoy their music and lyrics- Good Stuff
B007TNQ7EY|3.0|It's fairly decent like a bootleg gta San Andreas dialog is horrible but other than that game is pretty good not 5$  Good but good none the less
B00AZMFJYA|5.0|What a splendid relief from the psycho-babble Trek knock-offs that we got after Shatner retired.<br />This return to the good old days recaptures the best from the original series plus offers the best in the newest Special Effects.<br />I loved the first one. This second one is just as good.<br />This is a win, win, win!
B000UX6THK|5.0|I remember being blown away by this show when it first aired. In my opinion it changed the face of television.
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|I love this game. So excited its finally available for the kindle! It seemed like I waited forever for it!
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|so cute and fun<br />love it play it alot great treat for kids. too<br />would highly reccomend this game for everyone
B00AZMFK3K|5.0|My husband has every Star Trek movie.  After we saw this one in the cinema, he had to add it to his collection.  Great movie.
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|I am so excited that this has finally become available on the Kindle. I absolutely am addicted to this game.
B002G1K82Q|4.0|This is a fun musical with a lot of history and clever use of Beatles songs. The leads are fantastic, really enjoyed this!
B00DWZHTOU|5.0|What a delightful, entertaining movie from start to finish!<br /><br />If you plan to watch, I suggest you do yourself a favor and read as little about this movie as possible. You'll enjoy the imaginative script, entertaining acting and the magic shows much better.<br /><br />I will say a few things about the movie that won't ruin anyone's surprise. It is my intention not to oversell it, but enthusiastically recommend it.<br /><br />The fun, imaginative, well thought out story was written by Edward Ricourt and developed for the screen by Mr. Ricourt and Boaz Yaki. It is a light-hearted, multi-layered story with a beautiful platonic relationship. There is a romance, but it does not distract from the story, but helps move it forward.<br /><br />The acting ensemble is great. It is especially wonderful to see Mark Ruffalo in a leading role. Isla Fisher gives a confident, enthusiastic, powerful and sexy performance without being butch or sleezy, a refreshing change from most leading role actresses who are too skinny, flaunt their sexuality and are robotic and stunted in their performances.
0345529057|5.0|Bought the paperback edition of these books, fantastic deal, only 4 dollars a book. Good read too, can't stop till I'm done with all of them.
B00DJLLO0M|2.0|Weak release.Save your money.The pakaging is very nice though.lol<br />There's a few good tracks on this release,but overall it lacks bigtime.<br />The obvious has been mentioned numerous times.No S.W.,and it shows<br />all over this one.I'm sorry.I really love Blackfield.The first is<br />a masterpiece.II was excellent,and DNA was very good.IV is a real<br />step backward.I hope Steven has more to do with the next release???<br />I dig Aviv,but without the master,he's just a puppet.......Bummer.
B001BKVWYG|5.0|I like voices I guess you would say that are not harmonious.  Like joe cocker ,Stevie ray Vaughn etc!!, THis voice is one of those I was watching P.B.S. about his life and heard his music and loved it  he never made it big in the U.S. but in Europe.  He writes all his own songs and is great each one tells a story  the voice is haunting!!!!
B00DH4BL8Q|4.0|I enjoyed all the Greek mythology and playfulness of it all. The stories were great with fun characters and good character development.

0062112430|5.0|This book was amazing to me. Granted at first it took a while to get into but it became to a very fast paced point not to far in. Next thing I knew I couldn't put it down. Lauren oliver was born to write. Her style of writing is beautiful and highly relatable.<br />The story of an 18 year old girl living in a post apocalyptic world was simultaneously scary , beautiful and sad. I randomly decided to pick this up one day at target and I am so glad I did because it really affected me profoundly. I would DEFINITELY  suggest this story to most avid readers.
160774418X|5.0|I've only made one recipe so far - roast chicken with saffron, hazelnuts and honey - but it is amazing. Plenty, Ottolenghi's previous book, has been my favorite cookbook for several years, and I'm looking forward to adding these recipes to my repertoire. Beef and lamb meatballs bakes in tahini might be next....

After stealing the book from me and finishing it,  she promptly woke me up at 2am for not warning her it was good enough to make her cry - even though I hadn't finished it yet!  Despite knowing the ending,  I still ended up reaching for the tissue box.  I'd recommend this book to anyone.
B00B89LZ4C|1.0|I have been hooked on Breaking Bad ever since the first season, however I feel like the merchandise has paled in comparison to the stuff you can get for other hit shows like Game of Thrones. Most of it has been cheap or tacky stuff that has not done the series justice. With the Mezco Breaking Bad action figures I felt as though I had finally found something unique and worth having. So much that I was willing to pay 3-4 times the retail price and blatantly ignore the negative reviews. As it turns out my experience was just like many others.<br /><br />The item came on time but the backing board was taped together, therefore indicating that the seller knew the figure had already come apart. To make matters worse the figure was not bubble wrapped, there were no peanuts, paper or antyhing else to fill the space so it didnt move around, instead it was crushed inside the box thanks to a single airplus inflatable bag. At this point you have to wonder if the glue to stick the action figure plastic case to the backing board was faulty. For some this whole ordeal might not have been a big issue, but my plan the whole time was to at least put this away in an over-sized protective case or even go a step further and get it graded by AFA, afterall I was paying a premium for it.<br /><br />There is no wonder that intact Breaking Bad action figures garner a premium on ebay right now, however one has to wonder how long those will last before the glue starts to wear down. I'd advise most people to stay away if they are looking for a unique collectible to proudly display, which will withstand the test of time.
0425263908|5.0|This book was awesome! I got the series for my birthday and I recommend reading all 3 of the books. I thought there was no other books out there that was better than 50 shades of grey, but these are the best ( & I loooved 50 shades of grey). Worth every penny you spend on them! And I can't wait for the 4th one to come out!
B00371XIJE|5.0|This heart warming story is is well acted and directed. Not the usual sappy Hollywood production. Baby boomers to young kids will love it.
B00E4A830G|5.0|I loved Black Box and I love most of Michael Connelly's books. Especially his Inspector Bosch series. They keep me glued to the pages and they make me stay up too late. I am so very happy to receive my books on my Kindle because I have trouble reading from a normal book in bed. I wish I had ,had my Kindle at boarding school because ,with the light, I could have read under the sheets!.<br /> Ann from OZ
B002LFPAUC|5.0|This sitcom was way ahead of it's time!! Cleese is a master of comedy! I would like to have seen them make alot more episodes!
B007EC27QM|4.0|I just decided to write a review to clarify, because there are a couple reviews out there that day this app needs internet. this is false. the calculator runs fine without any connection. however, Amazon apps are verified by Amazon the first time you run them. that's likely what those people were experiencing. just open the app right after you download it and you're good. you could experience that with any Amazon app.<br /><br />I like the app, but I won't be using it because the calculator included with my Samsung phone is just as good.
B004EPZ070|5.0|This is such a great movie! It's really funny but also a romance. It has such a great story line and the ending is wonderful :)
B00CSR2J9I|5.0|there are few games that make me laugh as I play.  this is one of them.  I love it!  as you add better equipment you can fly over bumps and get extra points for flipping the car.  awesome!'
1594746036|5.0|I'm going to try my best to keep this as spoiler-free as possible! Don't say I didn't warn you.<br /><br />I've had my eye on this book for a couple months now and have had a copy of it for a while now. I waited until October to read this because I had heard it was a \\"creepy\\" book. This book only took me 3 days to finish, it was that good. I almost gave it a 4/5 stars, but the ending, wow. This is another favorite book of mine. I was nervous about reading it at first because the beginning was kind of boring, nothing went on for the first 70 pages. If there wouldn't have been pictures added to this, I may have gotten bored and not felt as creeped out or \\"scared\\". With the pictures added, you could actually see how these characters looked instead of trying to imagine what they'd look like.<br /><br />As always the characters, the world and the writing was just PHENOMENAL! Ransom Riggs did an amazing job making it seem as if you were in this world experiencing all of what these peculiar children were, that is, if they are alive or not. I really wish I could talk more about the characters in this story, but I'd probably spoil some of you that haven't read it and I wouldn't want to do that to you. If you are contemplating reading this, I'd suggest picking it up! It's the perfect time to read it! It's October and it fits in with the \\"creepiness\\" of Halloween.<br /><br />Our main character, Jacob is 16 and when he was little he was told stories of these peculiar children by his grandfather. He grandfather is an ex-soldier of World War II and escaped the Nazis. (Yes, this means he was Jewish).<br /><br />Of all the characters mentioned in this book, I can't think of a single character who I didn't like.. Okay, maybe there were a couple, but I can't really explain any further than that. It's definitely hard not to spoil anything from this book!<br /><br />I think what \\"scared\\" me the most was the fact that these photos used in this book are real. They weren't created for the story, they are real just as any other photo is. So the fact that these pictures are real, it definitely freaked me out.<br /><br />I'm really excited to see what happens next, but book 2- \\"Hollow City\\" doesn't release until January 14th... Which, isn't too far away, but it's still 3 months away which stinks.<br /><br />Favorite Quotes:<br /><br />  \\"I used to dream about escaping my ordinary life, but my life was never ordinary. I had simply failed to notice how extraordinary it was.\\"<br /><br />.<br /><br />  \\"When someone won't let you in, eventually you stop knocking.\\"<br /><br />.<br /><br />  \\"We cling to our fairy tales until the price for believing in them becomes too high.\\"story, they are real just as any other photo is.

B00FAPF5U0|4.0|Ever since I got my Kindle Fire HD in Apirl they just took Candy Crush off. Now after so many months I can now finally play with my family.
031624662X|5.0|I love this book.  If you're looking for a little think with your big space opera, then you will probably love this book too.  Firmly grounded in well established science fiction tropes while simultaneously highlighting said tropes for questioning, subversion and exploration of the problems those assumptions might carry, Leckie's Ancillary Justice has thoroughly fleshed out characters, fascinating intrigue and no shortage of high action sequences.  This is a highly enjoyable book that lets you feel smart when you figure things out and declines to spoon feed you, most especially the interior emotional life of its heroine, Breq.  Leckie's writing is reminiscent of the tense, indirect writing of Wolfe or Cherryh, with plenty of political commentary a la Mi&eacute;ville, and a sprinkling of Vance style vivid yet strange details.  Her book deals heavily in matters of identity and colonization, both topics of enduring appeal for me.  There's also some gender stuff which is interesting and worthwhile.<br /><br />Anyway, explosions! Plots against the many bodied ruler of a sprawling civilization!  Sentient spaceships!  And all with enough depth to argue Ancillary Justice as a 'serious' novel, so -- you know, tastes good and is good for you.
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|Love this game and was so excited when I could finally get it on my Kindle Fire. Not a game I will quickly tire of.
0938045768|5.0|I really enjoyed this book very informative and well written.  I am also thinking about getting his second book which breaks everything down a little further
B00005MEW1|5.0|it is exactly what it says it is the original movie put to industriel gothic music which in my openion makes it much more watchable since our generations arent use to silent film, but its great!
B00FRQ32N4|5.0|First of all the  graphics<br />Are a lot better then the first one the gameplay is better<br />I know my reviw was short but it is worth it
B00ANTX3HA|5.0|Absolutely fascinating. We need such smart and moral leadership for our department of defense now. I have great respect for Robert McNamara.
0783231032|5.0|Hilarious and a classic! Who wouldn't love it?! John Belushi and the star studded cast leave the viewer in stitches over this hilarious classic.
B005MMJ84K|4.0|With the intense finish to Delirium, I had to start this instantly. While I was hoping for the same feel as the book before, this one was much darker and had a sadness about it. Still a good book!
B009SJ3GUK|4.0|Season 1 I love so I hope to eventually like season 2 as well :)<br />I guess 'I like ghosts better'.<br />But the show is awesome love the actors
B005CRQ2DK|2.0|I love this book because I can relate to it it is the best book ever since I've been able to read

B00F8MI9NK|5.0|Our whole family loved it! A great family movie, almost better than the first! :) Perfect for any age, and loved by even the youngest.
B005DJREGQ|5.0|Hilarious stuff oh my GOD. I've only seen 7 episodes so far, and I am just dying of laughter! When Jenna says &#34;you're welcome&#34; to the bully... I was automatically hooked!
B008Y212PI|5.0|I've tried similar games, but this is the best. I really like the feature that allows blocks to be broken. Like pencil marks in sudoku, this allows more complex puzzles to be solved logically in steps.
B00B7Y0206|3.0|it says a lot about an app when you write in about it, but im still writing in about this one. it does what a free app should do and it lets you make playlists but it also fails to interest me enough to make me want to get an upgraded version which a good free app should really do. but overall i would say a SOLID b-

B000Y0Q5NM|5.0|This show is always fun to watch.  Imaginative storylines (mostly) and engaging characters.  With ten years of shows, it is a great one to get caught up in.
B00AYB1TP0|5.0|Tried the free version and bought the full app. It's worth every penny and my son enjoys the design. Always asks me for the app. Great work!

0140067477|5.0|Explaining things with goofy childhood characters is simple genius.  Explaining the philosophy without all the special characters and exotic aura makes the practices easier to understand and apply.  This former \\"Owl\\" has been seeing the error in his ways.
B0013WJGJ0|5.0|The start of it all. Keaton is amazing. Nicholson is a creep. It all starts here, with nods to Frank Miller, Burton gets it right. Or close enough to right.
B00FAPF5U0|3.0|It's o.k., I'm a little confused by others excitement for it. It's quite the money pit, like some others. I play other more challenging games that I don't have to deal with the annoying &quot;lives&quot; thing. Glad it's free, I would have been very disappointed had I payed for it.
B00FAPF5U0|4.0|It wont connect to my facebook!! It tells me i dont have access to the kingdom and when i do it again, it just says connecting but never goes anywhere!! Help!!!
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|I love Candy Crush Saga and it's about time we get the app on our kindles! Once you start playing you will be addicted! So watch out! :) ENJOY!
B00ARHAAZ6|5.0|I came to this book with serious doubts and through a tale told in wonder I found myself falling in love with all the characters of this book. They touch on all kinds of interesting subjects in this book and even dabble in love and I think maybe touching a bit on how it affects the side affect of the powers.
B002E2M5J6|5.0|This is a great concert, I upgraded to blu ray after watching it on a regular dvd. This concert is better than the &#34;Live in Verona&#34; concert
B003VS0CXS|5.0|Very good, old, clean, family movie for the grandkids.  Music, dancing, and fun for all.  You don't have to explain any off color stuff like too many of today's movies.
B00ARF93AQ|3.0|Pretty scary future, unique story line. Incredible special effects. Unfortunately you don't get enough into the characters to get lost in the movie. That's what makes a difference to me. You just watch it. Quality on the Kindle Fire HD 7&#34; was very good. Highly recommend headphones.
B009LGO88E|5.0|I bought this because I wanted to use it in Monster Hunter 3 Ultimate. It's pretty useful for underwater battles.<br /><br />Pros:<br />Easy to connect.<br />Better grip.<br />Improves game play for compatible games.<br /><br />Cons:<br />AAA battery required.<br />Might be too big for small hands.<br />Not so portable.<br />Limited game library use for it.
B001DHXT6G|4.0|The updated graphics sure make it more interesting to see the planets and space around the Enterprise. Have enjoyed rewatching the series!!
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|So glad that Candy Crush is finally available for the Kindle Fire. Been waiting for a while! Thank you for bringing the most addictive app to Fires everywhere!
B005HED08I|5.0|1966+Science Fiction=It's ok to laugh, but here's some serious social issues to think about too.<br /><br />Surprisingly enough, it looks quite good on a large modern tv too!
B00785P2QC|5.0|I love this game. This game is Very addicting and I can't wait for more games like this to come out.
B002DJVXHA|5.0|One of my favorite all time movies.  Has all the elements of human frailties, different approaches, and life's consequences in this compelling drama.  Anthony Hopkins never succumbs to random abandom of his ideals, the impeding doom of death does not corrupt his thinking in his lifelong pursuits.  His youngest daughter falls in love for his &#34;credence for falling in love&#34;. &#34;Lighting may strike&#34; !  You become personally involved with the different. Personalities in this film.  Brad Pitt is very captivating as the Grim Reaper and his wry humor in his depiction.  Seems quite human, even enjoys eating peanut butter, a great snack for all.
B00BHHIWQO|5.0|Awesome game love it my husband and. I challenge on another also great way to pass time. Love it - LOVE IT.
B00BPDR3F6|5.0|What an utterly fabulous book!  Elizabeth Gilbert has brought us a sweeping epic of the history of modern botany with a fascinating story wrapped around it.  I couldn't put it down. Her thorough research of these subjects is evident.  I recommend this book to anyone who enjoys historical fiction!
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|It is a good game of the most popular stories of the most popular stories of the most popular stories of the most common form of the most YouTube videos and a way that it was a way to go back in which the most popular stories of people who you
B001NLL93W|5.0|Love love love this book.  So beautifully written.  You feel like you are in the book.  Read it in just one day because I couldn't put it down.
B0055B7IPE|5.0|You get the feeling of a lost treasure in a man's relationship with his wife.<br />Plus a new found relationship with someone else that needs him, just as much<br />as he needs them. It teaches us to reach out to others, caring for each other<br />no matter what our circumstances are.
B00BP29SAA|5.0|I got this app to keep my baby brother occupied and boy did it ever! I could hardly get my kindle from him when I need it. Easy to use,  he (4 yrs old) figured out many of the activities without my help.  Got him excited and more observant when next we went to the supermarket so I would say he learnt something from this game. I would recommend this app to anyone who just wants a fun game for their kids that will grab their attention and keep them occupied for longer than 10 mins!
B00E8KLWB4|4.0|I really am enjoying this program.  It's not so easy that you get bored, nor so hard you stand around scratching your head wondering what to do next.  The crystals can get expensive so keep a good watch if you intend to use real money.  Good game, I recommend it whole heartedly.
B008JFUO72|5.0|I haven't even seen the movie but I'm sure it awesome both iron mans were great and I got to have this one to complete the series looking forward to watching it.
B004QKNXIQ|4.0|I tend to make watching animated films a priority. This one had a<br />lighthearted storybook tale of Rapunzel trapped in a tower by an evil<br />woman because she wanted to stay young forever.
034547581X|5.0|The true story of America's first combat against the North Vietnamese in the La Drang valley. History says that we won that battle, but did we really? This battle set the stage for the rest of the a long war. Our strategy went from one of &#34;take & hold&#34; to one of &#34;body count&#34; only. Great book!
B00FAPF5U0|4.0|Its a really fun game I love playing it but I dont like the hearts its really silly,  you should really try it out
B00FHAB3HW|1.0|Nothing on this CD is informational or insightful. I hope anyone is not wasting their hard earned money to purchase any of the songs for this little girl who has alot of growing up to do.
B00908DDZM|5.0|This Cd makes one think about ones life and it's heart felt about ones way at looking at things. If you like critical thinking this Cd is for you and than you can write your opinion about it.
B000002LSV|5.0|Their absolute best album! Full of terrific &#34;butt kicking rock-n-roll.&#34; From &#34;La Grange&#34; to &#34;Under Pressure&#34; their best songs are all here. If you're a serious ZZ Top fan then you gotta have this one!
1449410243|5.0|I bought a copy for a friend and after seeing it bought a copy for myself.  It's absolutely hilarious! For example, a drawing of a yawning cat's face (which is a pretty startling thing to see in real life) tells us that the cat is not really yawning but in fact is showing us his \\"war face.\\" Matt Inman nails it!  In one section he also reverses the cat-human roles in life and shows us how ridiculous a cat can be. The closest thing to the animal anarchy displayed by the cats in this book is very close to what you'll find with Dogbert in the Dilbert comics.<br /><br />If you like Matt Inman's \\"The Oatmeal\\" and/or cats you will definitely like this book.
B007J4T2G8|4.0|I definitely feel that the first book is the best of the trilogy.<br />I also believe that the Author deserves respect, just for the fact that she brought a subject that was taboo into the mainstream spot- light.<br />I don't believe that she covers the issue of BDSM in a realistic fashion, which is the reason that the BDSM community hasn't embraced the book. No one in the community cares to be perceived as having mental, or emotional issues, due to being kink friendly.<br />I have no problem with recommending the book, but understand that it is more of a romantic fantasy and not a realistic view of the lifestyle.
B008HK3XOU|4.0|I have had this cover over a year and It is still in great condition. I don't need a screen protector and I love the fact it powers down when shut. I also love the strap - keeps it closed but I also strap my hand through it to assure device is not dropped when in use.The only con is that you are unable to charge device with the cover closed, which is very aggravating.I hope Marware has fixed this fault. Overall, I would highly recommend this cover to any kindle user . It's lightweight and fits kindle like a book cover, just needs a more efficient way to charge it.
B004X4R49Y|5.0|Excellent movie and true. You will get great enjoyment from watching this film on the true life experience of King Edward VI
B00FAPF5U0|3.0|after all the talk about this game I am a little let down.  l don't like waiting for lives or having to pay for boosters.  I like the fruit 3 match game on Amazon much better.
B004DI7HZ6|3.0|The interesting plot of this book help to make up for the predictable romance, pedestrian writing and inconsistencies in the action.  It's embarrassing to admit that I found it quite entertaining.
B00A6CCF0K|5.0|An awesome follow up on Danny Torrences adult life. Compelling story that will keep you readung well into the night. I couldnt put it down. Steohen King once again nails it.
B000KW6HN2|5.0|Wonderful acting done by lead performers.Want to watch again and again.Loved the part where larry Flynt played the judge.Courtney Love amazes me with her acting talents,and Woody is awesome as Flynt.
B004SDSSFY|1.0|It wouldn't run on my kindle and now I cant even get a refund for it. Not worth the money I paid into it.
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|It's about time! Thank you for getting the version for the Kindle Fire! I've been waiting. It also works great!
B00FAPF5U0|3.0|This game is very fun. I would have given it 5stars but you really don't get enough lives when you get through a few levels. It doesn't take too long to get lives but I would rather keep Playing and it would be better if you could earn coins for lives and specials but instead it wants real money..
0920668372|5.0|Wonderfully sweet book. What a great book to have in the house and read to you kids. When my wife reads the book she not only reads but sings the part about what the mother says. This brings such a greater dimension to this book when you sing those parts.
B004J4WKUQ|5.0|It's rare to find a book where you want to immediately start reading again as soon as you finish the last page. This is one of those books. I grew up on all this stuff. Yes, I'm a nerd and ended up making a career out of slinging code, so I can relate to a lot of things in this book. This book brought back great memories. I remember Internet Relay Chat (IRC) before the term Instant Messaging (IM) was invented. Back then we called IRC - I Repeat Classes. I'm going to buy copies of this book to give to my friends, so they too can relive their childhood.
0143122010|3.0|I thought this was a good book and I call my rating 3-1/2 stars (but half stars are not available). The book is pretty massive but don't get discouraged because it is pretty interesting. Also, the last 100 pages are simply citations and footnotes. The author really did a great job reaching back through history and providing data and charts. However, this book takes some effort to get through, because it is long, single-spaced, and contains no pictures. I'm fine with that, however, it's just something one needs to be ready for as it can be a long haul to get through it. I found myself skimming many areas where I felt I got the jist of what he was saying and could move on. The extreme detail is there, though, for those who like that. He will go into specific data points, details on how our brains work, and more. As such, this is far from a cursory view of the topic. And, it is inspiring because it conveys such a convincing view that violence is declining overall, even with our living in the \\"age of terror\\". I found the book comforting in that way, although the author takes an unflinching view at violence and belief systems which may seem insensitive to some, but he was merely being analytic.
B007EC27QM|5.0|Greatttttt<br />Exellent app. Clean . Professional and very useful<br /><br />The best one so far no cmplaints<br /><br />Now you can also review the history of the calculation and everything
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|Yay! Candy Crush has made it to Amazon market. Great game played by nearly everyone I know. Hours of fun. I don't connect my games with FB so I had to start over with this install but I'm loving every minute of play. Looks great on my Kindle Fire HD 8.9&quot; tablet. Colors are brilliant and it's way more fun than playing on my little iPhone screen.
B00FAPF5U0|1.0|I don't understand it you run out of tries before your done trying, and there's also prices to get more tries and there are blocks that you cant make matches through it just doesn't make sense.
B009LDCXNY|5.0|I have loved this show since the first season.  It had some rough spots but just keeps getting better.  I love it.
B007HOOAH6|5.0|This is a bright and cute book that my son loves we gave been reading it regularly to prepare him for potty training.
B0094BB4TW|1.0|Just use your browser and go to the full FB website if you have the Kindle Fire HD 8.9&#34; Tablet. It's so much easier and works a lot better.
B00B4804KS|5.0|Looks like a brand new movie, and the sound is quite excellent as well! However I have to turn it down a bit since I live in an apartment complex and that T-Rex can get kinda loud lol.
B0099RFVXQ|4.0|This is a perfect action movie, it has it all. Great cast, dialogue, and special effects. Enjoy all the superheros in one movie.
B00BCMT4RA|5.0|Great album, just as expected!  After learning about Albert King, I finally purchased this album and it was everything I was looking for and more.
B009EEFTMC|5.0|I stumbled on this game app while browsing and watched the little video showing the game in play. Then I read the rating left by the 81 year old who is enjoying this game. I'm 58 and I love this game too! It's way more fun than mahjong. I love the 3d-like effects and the sounds. I did turn off the music.I recommend. Worth 99 coins, definitely.
B000VDUWMC|4.0|This book is worth reading. That said its got some flaws. Although its core idea is very strong many of its sub points are poorly supported, in some cases with almost comically bad arguments. For example, the fact that random animals were not domesticated recently (after societies acquired full suites of domesticated animals from other regions) is taken as evidence that the local animals could not be domesticated. The idea that people might just not want to embark on an expensive multi hundred year project when they have perfectly good alternatives is ignored. The section on domestication ignores all the domestication research that came out of the Soviet Union on rats and silver foxes so it's also weak in the sense that it ignores important parts of the literature.<br /><br />Quibble aside though, you'll learn a lot of interesting stuff by reading this.
B006LSZECO|4.0|Starts a little slow. She really builds the main characters. But then right when you are about to give up on the story altogether action hits you right in the face. From that point on it rolls on without a hitch. The ending shows what you are capable of no matter the choices you've made to get to the point that Nick and Amy find themselves.
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|Have been waiting for months for a kindle version of this game. It is fun and I haven't stopped playing since I downloaded it six hours ago. It is frustrating when you run out of lives and have to wait but you can buy lives or hit up fb friends to send you a life. I'm not one of those people who spends money on apps. I'm too cheap for that. Overall the game is fun and addictive.
B004SOR4H6|5.0|I've used lots of different twitter apps on my iPhone. This one on my Kindle Fire HD 8.9&#34; tablet really is the best. I find it so simple. It's much easier than using my browser on my desktop or laptop. This Kindle app works seamlessly.
B0027MJU00|3.0|Read because was recommended by my book club.  It was an ok read.  Sad...lonely...misunderstood story about the murder of a poor farm family.  I don't know if I cared for the way the story was written...alternating between now and then/flashbacks.  Mostly about people with low esteem moving through life. Darkplaces.
B009SJ3GUK|5.0|Simply amazing! Its brilliant on all levels. The storyline keeps you on your toes. &#34;Pepper&#34; is my favorite character. So many twists and turns. Lana banana has a great storyline!
0817439390|5.0|Great for beginners and novice, easy to read with good examples on how to achieve what you trying to do.
B00EEDJM2Q|4.0|I'm not sure if this is a children's game or not, but it really doesn't matter. I started playing it and enjoyed it. After a few levels I was starting to have to think about what I was doing and I could just picture a 5 year old doing much better than I can!
B00C7JG0KG|2.0|I have no problem with the movie or the 3 d version...... I am disappointed in Disney not including the regular DVD version in this packet
B00FJTYDKK|5.0|Very cute animation and story line.  My grandsons loved it and never got bored.  They are ages 6 and 8.
B002VPE1WK|5.0|a nice photography gear bag. Plenty of compartments and room for all your equipment. Nice ends on zipper pulls to get quick access to gear. Price was well worth it
B0074QGGK6|5.0|After reading Dr. Andy's book [[ASIN:B00F3UP8O0 Creativity, 63 short exercises to a Happier Life]] (a great book with good exercises by the way), I decided I wanted to get into the topic of creativity to a deeper level. So I picked up this book and I am glad I did.<br /><br />What Kleon does in this book is take a lot of the mystique out of creativity and show how you can use the idea of mixing what others have done to come up with great ides that take the concepts to a new level not before envisioned.<br /><br />The book is full of information about how to work with your own creative instincts and bring forward excellent new ideas even if your skills have been dormant for a long time or you have been caught in in a dead end job that does not seem to give an outlet for your finer instincts.<br /><br />This book is well on the way to becoming a classic in the field, and with good reason, I highly recommend it!
B004FGMDOQ|5.0|We read this book for our book club.  I like fantasy because it takes me away from the everyday stuff.  The characters were interesting and the plot was fun to follow.  I did have a couple of unexplained fantasy questions but maybe they will be answered in the next book.
B007EC27QM|3.0|I don't see what's special about this calculator. If you have a smart phone, which you should have if you are thinking of downloading this app, then you already have a better calculator which comes withit. No scientific mode or any fefeatures besides all generic 1980s calculator.
B009KS4XRO|2.0|Would like faster wins.  Can never get enough coins to keep playing. Like when can play more than one or two games.  Need to find games with higher payouts and wins also would d be nice if we could see who we are playing against
B0089EHWQE|5.0|This book was written with understanding and compassion. The question of assisted suicide remains is of utmost importance and<br />remains.
B009UAO1ZG|5.0|I'm not much on in-depth reviewing but at the of this book, I wished it had another 500 pages to go. Just a great book.
B009ZQC7MY|5.0|I love this series.  You never know what will happen next, don't want to be a spoiler.  The characters are interesting and as in real life change and surprise us sometimes.  The story of the family upstairs is interesting but no more than the what goes on with the group downstairs.
B00F91RYL8|5.0|This movie is gripping from start to finish.  It's not gory but just an edge of your seat thrill ride.
B001NIAQ9I|2.0|How can a movie called &#34;Funny Girl&#34; be so depressing? Okay, Fanny Brice had a depressing life. Why not just call it &#34;The Fanny Brice Story?&#34; The music was beautiful, and Barbra Streisand's singing was amazing, but the voices of most of the other actors were so annoying, I could barely get through the movie.
B00D7OMNXS|4.0|I dont think that this was better than the first two movies , but it was still good and my boys liked it.
0670024856|5.0|This was a remarkable book that I couldn't put down. It kept me guessing until the end. I especially liked how new characters are introduced throughout the novel.
B0001MDP3G|5.0|Great movie!! Absolutely worth buying! I can and will watch it over and over again! Can't go wrong with a good love story and some strong independent women!
B00742GBDM|1.0|Beautiful cinematography and costumes.  Mansfield Park seemed much too grand for the Bertrams.  It is more suited to an earl than plain Sir Thomas.  The introduction of slavery as a subplot was heavy handed, as was the lechery of Sir Thomas.  In the book he is dignified and rather righteous.<br /><br />Where is William?  Where did Mary Crawford get her lesbian tendencies?  She has her hands all over Fanny in more than one scene.<br /><br />I am disappointed in the attempts to &#34;modernize&#34; the works of a decidedly modern book.  Way too Hollywood and not enough BBC.
B0087FMUCQ|5.0|A great way to relax and past time. The user interface is clean and graphics are excellent. Challenge enough to be involved without overwhelming.
B001NEK2GE|5.0|When I first looked at a gamepad I figured that it was a waste of money. I thought that there was no point to it because a keyboard got me the results I wanted anyway. This is, at least, what I thought when I looked at stuff like the razer nostromo and razer orbweaver. Both items were overpriced for what you got, and all it really did was give you a keyboard extension where you can reprogram the buttons. For somebody new to keyboards, that would be pretty cool, but in reality you can get a keyboard from razer for the same price,that has the same form of button configuration which is exactly what I use. I have a basic wireless logitech mouse which I was planning to upgrade soon, a standard desktop computer setup, a razer deathstalker (I highly recommend it), and my newest edition which is the Logitech G13. When I looked at the G13 I figured it was like the other Razer stuff. But when I really looked at it, What got me was what you got for the price. The ergonomics, the extra stat screen to check on how you're doing in game, and the extra buttons compared to other gamepads really sold it. But what pushed it over the edge was the customization. When you look at the gamepad, instead of thinking just the keys are programmable, let me tell you this: Every mechanic on that gamepad can be changed to your liking. Everything from the joystick to the macros to the software to the color of the gamepad. Everthing can be changed. So for price and convenience, logitech really won this battle.<br /><br /> Next is the comfort in comparison to a extremely good gamepad, the razer orbweaver. Excluding the 100$ price, the orbweaver is one of the best in the razer lineup. I do not personally own one, but one of my friends lets me use it all the time at his house. And to be honest... It's underwhelming. Only one set color, 20 programmable buttons, compared to the 22 on the G13, and Razer synapse 2.0. Granted It's not that bad, but at the same time it's surprisingly hard to use. Logitech software is less flashy, yes, but it has so much more potential than synapse.<br /><br /> So after I took all these things into consideration when I was buying my own gamepad, the answer was obvious. The Logitech G13 is one of the best gamepads you can get out on the market today, and I recommend it to any and all rts, mmo, fps and other players that just want a more comfortable and fun gaming experience.
B00ARF93AQ|3.0|the movie had a lot of action . the only problem was that the movie kept stopping and pausing thru out the movie, there wer several times i had to restart the movie, very annoying,
B009LMTDL0|5.0|She describes many of the pit falls of women in the work place including not asking for more. I worked in an era when even less consideration and expectations for women were more.
0694003611|5.0|My daughter loved this book so much that she broke the first board book and I had to get her another.  As you know it is very difficult to damage a board book, but that is how much she loved it.
B0091GRI0O|2.0|I was given the print version as a gift and, since I have my tablet available, I bought the kindle version. The body of the work is identical to the print version but it is missing the author's introduction, which I found very helpful.
B000002JNJ|2.0|Very disappointed. The case inside was broken. This has happened on several cd's I've bought. Such great music should be inspected.
B0010SKUYM|5.0|This book is on par with all the fantasy greats. It is sweeping, poetic and a great adventure. Characters are vibrant and relatable and the reader will be caught up in the force of the narrative before they finish the first page.
0920668372|4.0|This was a book I would read to my daughter every night.  It is really for boys and I wish the same story would be done for Girls.
0345803485|5.0|A must read if you haven't already!!!! The rumors of the books are true. They are awesome!! Haven't read anything like them.
B00F91H666|1.0|I really wish they would have made it clear that this is a gruesome zombie movie. I thought it was a pandemic type movie, but it is walking dead on steroids. I only made it through about 5 min.... Wish I could give 0 stars
B000QRIGLC|5.0|Possibly one of the most harrowing stories of triumph over impossible odds I have ever read. From beginning to end you can't put this book down. From the detailed SEAL training to the unbelievable survival in the rugged mountains of Afghanistan, the awe and respect I have for our servicemen grew by the page. Marcus Luttrell is a true American hero.
B00A6CCF0K|5.0|I thought the book was awesome, there was so much going on that seemed unrelated at first, they pulled all together halfway through for a great sequel to Dan Torrance's life as an adult...loved it!!
0345803507|5.0|I had heard about it and finally read all three books and they are awesome!! A must read if you haven't!!!!
B003LQ3YXU|5.0|This is a great Quirky and campy remake.<br />I have enjoyed the whole series and I am looking forward to the next.<br />As a side note I hate that amazon requires a certain amount of word for reviews.<br />sometimes I just want to give a quick rating and a few words.
B009XIXVU6|3.0|I loved Hosseni's last 2 books, so I was looking forward for this,but was very disappointed.I had to force myself to finish it.There are too many characters and at the end its hard to follow who is who and whats their importance in the story.I loved the part about Abdullah and Pari,I loved the way he narrated their childhood and the special bond they shared.But then I felt like the story was dragging and at the end I wasn't even sure if I was reading the same book.
B005HEPIDS|5.0|I liked this series as one of the best of the Star Trek shows. I hadn't seen this year of shows since it was originally broadcast and really enjoyed seeing them again.
B00A6CCF0K|5.0|I loved it!  Thought it was one of the best sequels I've ever read.  Stephen King is one of my favorite authors, and this is one of his best books.
B00632HWOG|4.0|I like it because it works pretty much like yahoo mail works on my Apple devices.  I dislike it for the same reason.  On balance I like much more than I dislike it.
B00DHHWXYY|4.0|This is my favorite novel ever, and I've taught it for years, so I was expecting to hate the movie, as I did the 1974 version.  Lurhman, however, got some important elements of the book even though he didn't seem to get others (e.g., in the book Gatsby's gangland connections are hinted at, not shown, as, for example, in henchmen beating up a guest outside the gates).  Carey Mulligan made me see why Nick and Gatsby both might have found her more than a bubble-head, even though she remains true to form, and Leonardo diCaprio--so unlike what I've always pictured Gatsby to be--was surprisingly effective.  Tobey MacGuire, on the other hand, seemed too hapless to be Nick, and, while the psychiatric setting framework made it easy to translate the narrator's voice to film, Nick is the last person I'd see needing to be institutionalized.  The contemporary music, which I was expecting to find jarring, actually worked. I think if I hadn't read the book I'd have liked the movie on its own terms.
B0018RWMNM|5.0|In my opinion, this is the best movie of all time.  Yes, I'm aware that this  was a TV mini series.  I think of it as a movie, and it is my personal all time favorite.
1416955070|5.0|I have not seen the movie yet, wanted to read the first book. NOw cant wait to read the rest of them and to see the movie

B00CKH9WOQ|5.0|well dressed, love her hair and dress, we have a lot of monster high dolls, but she is very detailed and unique
B00ANA27IU|5.0|I first read this book in 1969, immediately after seeing the movie for the first time.  It's just as good the second time around.
B0050DIWFC|4.0|I downloaded this book. It was very good. I have been stuck on Stephen King since highschool so this was a completely different kind of book . It kept you interested the entire time.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|Good game, fast, very addictive. Cities change a lot, makes the game more fun. Wish there were a few more power ups though. Over all, I give it five stars.  Keep up the good work.
B005FPT51K|5.0|Very nice myself  and my wife are enjoying the use of the products , i can see my baby at any time.
B001G70M6S|5.0|These 3000B pack film photos are spectacular!  Sharp and crisp, whether shot outside in the sun or inside with your flash.  And people LOVE LOVE LOVE the look-it's so nice to see real black and white film photographs that you can hold in your hand and that are one of a kind, not an ink-jet printout that's a copy of digitals that are copies of copies.  I shoot this film all the time at events and everybody, young and old, loves them.

B00FAPF5U0|1.0|This game sucks! It can be fun at times but I swear all they do is cheat! It's really unfair! How am I supposed to play a game and try to win when all they do is cheat?! I'm deleting this game RIGHT NOW!
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|I've been waiting for Amazon to get this game, & I couldn't be happier!  I can now play on my big screen,  no more draining my cell phone battery.  This game is highly addictive!
140132634X|5.0|Bought it for my Mom who loved it. Waiting to finish semester so I can check it out.  Heard it was thought provoking.  Filler filler filler filler filler filler
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|Man I love this ridiculously super fun game....however I do wish on the board where you have to bring down the fruit that it would actually let u bring down the fruit those levels are frustrating.....
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|I bought this app and I am 100% glad I did so. It's a lot like bejewled,  but actually has a storyline and better power ups. I never played this game until two days ago, and I would personally recommend this to anyone. YOU WON'T BE SORRY
B00BXZ3D6Y|4.0|I have not delved into this program's abilities fully to understand what it can do but for simple recording and immediate playback, it worked very well.  And it was free!
B00FPH6AXE|1.0|What can you expect from M.  Night? He thinks of his movies as a Work of Art. While Movies are an Art MEDIUM, they are not a single painting. One can convey a single idea in a single painting with emphasis and impact and it will work. It is a tiny window into a single milisecond of time and space. A movie, however, is not a single milisecond. It is a panorama that flows through time to convey an idea. Night will focus on a single idea he wants to convey with impact----and then ignore logic and intellect and simple common sense for an entire 2 hours.<br /><br />I agree with what everyone else has said previously but there is something else that bothered me much more in this horrible movie beyond the terrible acting and swords. We are expected to believe that we destroyed Earth and had to move to another, more inhabitable planet in the galaxy. That's a fine premise, and makes sense. However, now, 1,000 years later, we have 2 characters crash land on a perfectly good Earth. There's nothing wrong with it. We're expected to believe that there's not enough oxygen on a planet that is covered in trees, and still rife with native wildlife. We're expected to believe that on a planet with blue skies, clouds and an ocean teaming with life, Humans Cannot Live. But we can live on an alien world where we have to fight alien predators constantly sent to kill off our invasion? Everything on this new earth is bright and clean and we live simply and in harmony with nature....but we humans can't go back to an Earthly Paradise and survive for 10 minutes with having to take medication packs to save us from the atmosphere--an atmosphere That is fine for baboons and massive flocks of birds and lions and whales...but will kill us. We can't go back to earth and repopulate and live in harmony there with nature--perhaps because lions and baboons are more dangerous than alien creatures specifically bred to kill us off? We cannot re-adapt to the gravity, but our closest relative, the monkey, seems to be surviving just fine.<br /><br />The complete illogic of this one idea of the movie, which the director continuously tries to shove down our throats, is then hammered home when a character can climb a volcanic mountain that is covered in lava and ash that would Kill a Human in minutes--without even sweating. We can't survive on a Paradise Earth covered in Oxygen generating trees, but we can not only climb a volcano and live, we can fight off an alien creature at the top of that mountain....with gusto.<br /><br />If the Earth of this movie had been shown as a wasteland a thousand years after our departure, the movie would have made sense. This makes no sense at all. Like every other M.Night movie. Why does Hollywood continue to give this man money to bore and frustrate and waste our precious time?
B0030KCLFY|5.0|i really like the animation. my daughter couldn't quite get it at first. she couldn't understand why the characters didn't talk at all! i guess that disney movies have spoiled her a bit! but it is very nice and poetic. beautiful artwork
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|Candy crush is a good game to play bundle of fun and just have an addiction to the game,but wish I could have more than five turns
B00A6CCF0K|5.0|Not that I haven't enjoyed his late books, but the style of this one brings me back to his books in the 90's that I read from front to back without putting down!: Tommyknockers, Christine, It, The Stand! Ultimate good vs evil Stephrn King!!!!!
B000050X31|5.0|This item was purchased as a gift for a teenager who has already made music his career. He has likely already watched this several times and will be watching it again and again, I am sure, because he is a huge Mozart fan.
B00CF34B2I|4.0|This game has its limitations, but the expasion more than covers them. So Magic 2014 is the best on amazon, and it runs smoothly.
B00CHSPB8Y|5.0|Great game. Has beautiful graphics. Easy to play. Good for both adults and children. Has lots of replay value. No pushing for you to you the in app purchases.
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|I am so happy that you finally got candy crush on Kindle firer HD. This game is so so addictive. I can't stop playing. Every break I get I'm playing Candy Crush.
B00DJFIMW6|4.0|This game is so fun! I wish there wasn't as much Facebook things and the tokens are dumb, but it doesn't really matter. I really like this game.
B009KS4XRO|2.0|This is as game you do not want to spend money on. You lose a lot. It is addicting to play.
B00CF34B2I|1.0|The app would b worth the $10 as it has great story and gameplay but i can't believe you still have to win a match to unlock every card in all the decks. it might help the replay value but it crashes after I win so whats the point. I'll give it 5 stars when its fixed.<br />l
B009JZWO3I|5.0|Its the most compelling season yet! I highly recommend watching the series, the background music is always good and its clever how they show whats on the computer screens whenever something digital needs to be shown.
B007SGM084|5.0|Could I possibly be in love with the story or is it Christian Grey? I'm moving to Seattle to see which ;)
1594484805|3.0|The book was well written, engaging, and a quick read. I thought the theories he presented made a lot of sense. The book even initiated some dialogue between my friends and me. But really, this book is geared towards people who run companies. It tells you about the studies on what kills motivation for employees. It tells you about what best preserves employee motivation. It does not tell you much about how to create this elusive intrinsic motivation. His &#34;toolkit for the individual&#34; is a few pages long, and it doesn't give much advice on how to get yourself motivated. It talks about tracking when you are most motivated, gives a little mantra for you, and then (most absurd) recommends you take a year off every seven years.<br /><br />Good read, but I was looking for something a little more self-help-ish, I guess.
0785153942|1.0|I don't read comic books, nor graphic novels.  That immediately makes me both ignorant and biased.  (In the name of fairness, I will also distance myself from judging the artwork one way or the other since I am not accustomed to industry standards.)  The ONLY reason I got this book was to support &#34;Pacific Rim&#34; in whatever ways I could, not because I actually was compelled to get it.  (I also have several 4.5&#34; action figures, the 3-disc Blu Ray, and the CD soundtrack.)<br /><br />While there are a lot of unanswered [often trivial] questions from the film, I figured some of those were intentionally left vague and/or cut for running time.  And, supposedly, &#34;...Tales From Year Zero&#34; is supposed to give us some of that back story.<br /><br />You know what?  It doesn't.  Not at all.<br /><br />The majority of characters in this book do not appear in the movie, most of the scenarios are unrelated to what happens in the movie, and many of these &#34;tales&#34; show us almost nothing new that we can't already figure out from the movie itself.  That awesome picture on the cover?  You'd expect to see THAT fight within the pages, right?  That's the first Jager VS Kaiju fight, right?  WRONG.  The first Jaeger is a poorly-proportioned shiny black humanoid crab, and it is the prototype Jaeger that goes into battle first.<br />We don't see the thought processes of developing the Jaeger Project, nor the politics of both how it was funded and disassembled.  While the first Jager appeared within a year of the first Kaiju attack (as stated in the movie), this book does nothing to show us that process.  The only mainstay character(s) from the movie are Stacker Pentecost and the Beckett brothers, and they all get relegated to secondary roles.<br />The revelation of the neural handshake comes across more as a lazy coincidence- they just so happen to have a 'back-up' headset in the control center all geared up to interface at the same time... even though no consideration had been given to the fact ahead of time that two humans would be needed at the same time- rather than the stunning revelation it should have been through trial and error.  (WHO THE HELL WROTE THIS THING!?)<br />Cherno Alpha- the last surviving first-generation Jaeger in the movie- isn't mentioned or hinted at either, nor other countries' efforts.<br /><br />If I could say anything positive about the story, I'd have to lay it on two sub-plots that both deal with drifting.  (There is another one I liked- dealing with what happened to Pentecost's co-pilot from Coyote Tango WHICH ISN'T EVEN MENTIONED BY NAME NOR SHOWN ONCE IN THE BOOK- but it's certainly not worth the cost of buying this book to find out.  Big surprise: the co-pilot dies from radiation exposure.  There, now you don't have to buy the book)<br /><br />There's a romance that develops between the prototype Jaeger's original pilot and the Jaeger Project's lead neural interface scientist.  While ill-described within the book, it is apparent that drifting can have lasting effects on one's mindset after the drift has ended- something which was not shown in the movie.  The scientist was meek as a mouse at the start of her story, but through multiple neural handshakes she gains confidence from connecting with the other pilot... and this eventually leads to a romance between the two.  (I wonder if that's how Cherno Alpha's pilots got married- falling in love while drifting...?)<br />The other one deals with how privacy is ripped apart within the drift.  While we get to see Raleigh and Yancy Beckett's enrollment into the PPDC, the majority of their tale in this book is after they've already been approved and are waiting for construction of Gipsy Danger to be finished.  One of the brothers has a crush on a girl outside the program, but doesn't make any advances.  Then, weeks later, that brother finds out that the other brother is dating the same girl.  (Wait wait wait- it took weeks for this to surface when theydrifted how many times between those two times?  I thought nothing was hidden in the drift!?)  Anyways, the first brother finds out mid-drift, and it ruins a simulation, leading to fisticuffs shortly afterwards outside the base.<br /><br />Both of these sub-plots are not big revelations, but rather show some of the darker side(s) of drifting which the movie could not afford time-wise.  (I hope that a &#34;Pacific Rim 2&#34; film will delve more into drifting relationships, though not necessarily romantic ones.)<br /><br />How did Pentecost meet up with and adopt Mako Mori?  What was the first true non-prototype Jaeger battle?  What was the first Jaeger to fall?  Why are the Jaeger hangars called &#34;Shatterdomes&#34;?  How many Jaegers were built?  How are pilots chosen?  What happens if one pilot qualifies but the other doesn't?  Was America the first country to deploy Jaegers?  Was there resistance to developing Jaegers?  How did the PPDC come to the decision to turn away from Jaegers and build Anti-Kaiju Walls?  Did second- and third-world countries have Jaegers?  If so, did THEY build them, or were they gifted or loaned?  Did Kaiju attack the same cities more than once?<br /><br />There are soooooo many questions this book could have addressed, because really it is not limited to just the year 2014 like the title implies.  Pentecost's co-pilot dies many years after 2014, the Becketts were recruited years later, on and on and on the list goes, and there's just no great satisfaction in anything that &#34;Tales From Year Zero&#34; presents.<br />As I stated at the beginning, I only bought this book to support the cause, not because I actually wanted to read it.  I kinda want my money back now, because it left such a sour taste in my mouth and I feel like I got ripped off.  It's not kid-friendly, but it's not smart either.<br /><br />&#34;Pacific Rim: Tales From Year Zero&#34; is just not worth it.  Just look up scans of it online, and call it good.
B009JZSC9S|5.0|I loved it. One thing about this show is that it is consistently good. Each new season doesn't disappoint! The characters are so well developed, I feel like I know them or would like to.
B00CIVLZ3U|4.0|Keeps you interested all the time. I think Sanderson has few better ones however eg Mistborn first three books or of course Way of the Kings
B00CEF014E|5.0|While reading this novel, I kept trying to guess at the ending.  I was shocked to find out the truth.  The whole work was full of suspense.  I was sitting on the edge of my seat by the end.  Don't want to give away any spoilers, but Dana was like a superhuman.  I'm also hoping that the little girl doesn't develop any problems later on in the future. The whole place was twisted.  But at the beginning, I thought it was all a mental thing.  The book flowed nicely and the descriptions painted a wonderful picture.  I could visualize each and every character, even the cat.  Great Job!
B00EKWTLUO|4.0|I'll be honest- I did not go to the theater to see &#34;Pacific Rim&#34; for the music.  If the music was good, that was a bonus.  After researching the score afterwards (ahem- streaming from a certain Tube site), my first thought was &#34;It sounds just like 'Iron Man'&#34;.  Aside from the fact that Ramin Djawadi did indeed compose the score for both &#34;Pacific Rim&#34; and &#34;Iron Man&#34;, and the music was often drowned out by the sound effects in the theater (awesome sound effects), it's basically like he took unused cues from the latter and saved them for a later film... and that's basically what you get here: a repackaged version of &#34;Iron Man&#34;.<br />Yes there are some nice individual tracks (I particularly like Track 7- &#34;Mako&#34; for --*SPOILER*-- its haunting tragedy of a helpless little girl about to be crushed by an immense monster --*END SPOILER*--), but it doesn't really standout with a unique sound.  The Kaiju's theme is simple for their brutal and mysterious nature, but the hero/Jaeger theme doesn't get a whole lot of variation to it and becomes rather redundant after a while.  (Perhaps some more unreleased cues to flavor things up a bit could have been added...?)<br />Of all the people I share it with, though, we all agree that the original song &#34;Drift&#34; is both painful to listen to, and humiliating to the film.<br /><br />It is clear to me, though, that this is one of those movie soundtracks that sounds better within the movie itself (where you're not paying it any strong attention but still notice it) rather than played individually by itself.
B00EGMQIJ0|2.0|The Circle poses some interesting concepts, but those concepts as written are full of holes.  First, the idea of eliminating anonymity on the internet, when a good bit of the lively discussion and full disclosure on the internet is enabled by that very anonymity.  Second, the idea of people clamoring for the products and ideas of this company without naysayers and critics.  Assumption of more homogeneity among all the humans on the globe than possible.<br /><br />Also, this starts out in a style that seems written for middle-schoolers, then shifts gear with language and sexuality more appropriate to YA lit.  All in all, not great.
B005FITIK0|5.0|The brilliant actress Charlize Theron turns in a soul sapping performance as she brings home many an adult's convoluted memory of high school. Black comedy? I suppose. But it tends more towards pure drama. We've all seen movies where a writer narrates a film while penning their adventures. What a great twist here though. It's more of a deluded fantasy because the viewer hears an occasional lofty narrative, but what plays out is a weird anti- fairy tale.<br /><br />The main character leaves her phony glamorous life as a young adult book writer due to a miserable existence and heads back to small town USA where she grew up.  She tries to capture the boyfriend of her teens that is now married and has a baby.<br />Great acting all around as the psychological passings of life give you a zing. Alcohol fuels the fire as an old nerdy high school classmate tries to set her straight while living in his own undesirable state. A film about not growing up and being full of yourself. There's an entertaining sadness about it all because it is done so well, unlike the crap that's often in films that drag you through tears. The blu ray is worth it.
B0033780Y0|4.0|I am so sad that Freddie Mercury had already passed away before I discovered I loved Queen's music, and I was very curious about him.  I think this book treats him well, giving the reader an idea of what he was like, how he lived and it has made me buy more of the songs they made.  RIP Freddie, so sad you left us so early!
B008QTVNUI|4.0|Captured & held our attention. We weren't sorry for spending the time watching it. Looking forward to continuing the story of Carrie, especially.

B00CWY76CC|5.0|Really enjoyed playing this game. Just the right amount of challenge without being too hard. Can't wait for more rooms.
B00EE3FVSU|5.0|Although the eight episodes are a little long, this is an emotionally moving mystery that will leave you guessing throughout. The best thing about it is its creation of realistically flawed characters as we see the secrets of a small town unveiled. I particularly liked David Tennant's performance as a troubled lead investigator. If you guess the killer, you are a better detective than I am.
B003TSEEDY|3.0|I was disappointed in this book honestly. After all the amp and rave, I decided, wow, this book really must be something for all my friends to love it and for a movie to be made. So I buy it and read it. I found it very predictable the book failed to invoke any pity or admiration for Charlie within me. It was well written and the style was fantastic, I just don't think it matched the hype.

0399159347|5.0|I thoroughly enjoyed this book. We had a long power outage here so I read alot. I finished the 400 page book in just over a day. The characters were believable and complex. The plot took many twists and turns. I remained interested all the way through. No, I didn't guess the secret.

B00AZMFJYA|4.0|I only gave it 4 stars because i was sorry i never saw it in the theater! The &#34;insider&#34; references to Star Trek series and the characters' history was wonderful. I adored Benedict Cumberbach as a bad guy, too. In spots it was a bit too campy but otherwise i really liked it and would recommend it!
B0058UXHHK|4.0|Twenty-eight and a Half Wishes was a fun and enjoyable Southern mystery, mostly due to the strength and uniqueness of Rose, the main character.  She thoroughly engaged me and reminded me quite a bit of Sookie Stackhouse with a very chick lit flavor.  The romantic storyline is sweet and spicy, the plot was a bit predictable but I do recommend this book. I'm interested enough to try the rest of the series.

B00B8R1NP0|5.0|The author has such a unique writing style that caught my attention at the first page! I constantly found myself saying I would stop in a few pages and wound up reading late into the night! I enjoyed the author's use of the present tense, which is something new and unique to the mystery genre. It kept me guessing even more and made me feel like I was truly in the story! The plot twists were amazing I wish I could tell you about them! This book makes you feel like you are watching a movie it is truly engaging. One of the most original plots I've read in a long time. I highly recommend!

B00EEDJM2Q|4.0|I enjoy this game quite a bit. It makes me think strategically, without being overly taxing. The graphics are fun, too. It does have a habit of flashing off momentarily when the ads switch, which can be distracting, though.
B000001ESP|5.0|Rush's eighth full-length studio album, 1981's \\"Moving Pictures,\\" is one of the band's two best efforts (1978's \\"2112\\" is the other). And it's more than that -- it is also one of the best hard rock and progressive metal releases of the Eighties. And when considering the fact that the likes of Iron Maiden, Queensryche, Neurosis, Dream Theater, Fates Warning, and King Crimson (among numerous other groups) all dropped progressive metal landmarks that decade, that is REALLY saying something!<br /><br />The record opens on a surprisingly heavy note, with \\"Tom Sawyer\\" being a big-riff rocker that, aside from featuring a new-wavy-sounding synth intro, abides mostly by chunky and metallic guitar and bass riffs. A screaming, shredding, epically wailing guitar solo is also featured, here, as is plenty of deft, dexterous, and dramatic drum fills. Two of the other best tracks on this fine album include \\"Red Barchetta,\\" which has a melodic, proggy guitar intro and a gorgeously sweeping, jazzy melodic solo; and the ridiculously epic \\"The Camera Eye,\\" which clocks in at roughly eleven whole minutes in length, and features a long, drawn out, and terrifically trippy keyboard intro.<br /><br />But it is actually track three, \\"YYZ,\\" that takes the cake for being the record's highpoint. And, actually, it is more than that -- it is a definite standout in Rush's whole discography. It is an expansive -- and completely instrumental -- centerpiece that finds the band opting for a nearly blistering and frenzied approach. It does, after all, feature a surprisingly brisk tempo, Led Zeppelin-esque blues-metal guitar riffage, beeping bass lines, and Deep Purple-reminiscent guitar soloing. And despite being an indisputably epic and multi-faceted piece, it somehow manages to maintain cohesive form throughout. As a result, it is also simultaneously readily accessible.<br /><br />So, in a nutshell: \\"Moving Pictures\\" is a masterful progressive metal opus that is as rewarding as it is epic, intricate, and unpredictable. Hence, even if you barely even claim to call yourself a fan of the genre, you need to own it.and unpredictable.

B004JN1D2I|5.0|I had heard so much about the series, I kept at the chance to read the book. My imagination coupled with the rich tapestry painted by Mr. Martin weaves a rich landscape of majesty and intrigue.
B000JMKNVK|5.0|Somehow I missed this book (and the Kenzie and Gennaro series) and I've got some catching up to do.  I've read Lehane recent works and loved them.  My wife found this at the library and told me to read it.  Loved it.  Can't wait to read the rest.
0140042520|3.0|the story itself is great. I ordered it for my brother as a birthday present . disappointed with the flimsiness of the book . I know it's a paperback but for almost 12 bucks i expected a cover that felt like little more than construction paper.
B008WCP2PG|3.0|\\"Magic Mike\\" is directed by Steven Soderbergh, one of the most critically acclaimed directors in recent years. The film deals with the world of male stripping, with a story that is, it is reported, loosely based on the life of the star Channing Tatum. This is interesting, I thought, and yes, the dancing part is pretty impressive, but the rest of the film seems too slow-paced and low-keyed for me to be really interested, except the comic relief from over-the-top Matthew McConaughey.<br /><br />The story is about \\"Magic Mike,\\" a dancer (played by effective Channing Tatum) at Xquisite Strip Club in Tampa, dreaming of becoming a furniture designer. Mike befriends and takes aimless Adam (Alex Pettyfer) under his wing, and as it turns out, Adam, or The Kid, quickly gets accustomed to the new lifestyle. In the meanwhile, Mike gets acquainted with Adam's concerned sister Brooke (Cody Horn).<br /><br />There is a stark contrast between the ways in which the dancers' on-stage routine and off-stage life are described. One is full of loud music and well-choreographed dancing, while the other is quiet, drab and dull. I would even say too dull, because despite the interesting character of Mike and the realistic descriptions of the backstage, most characters are just cyphers. We are never allowed to know these dancers, and as to the main story of Mike, Adam and Brooke, well, I think I have seen it somewhere before.<br /><br />\\"Magic Mike\\" is a missed opportunity, a film that could have been much emotionally involving with someone other than Soderbergh as director, who tends to be too self-conscious. I think I know his style, and I respect that. The film is sensitively and intelligently directed, but I think a little bit of more emotion would be welcome sometimes.
1452115567|5.0|Like many other reviewers here, I put my copy on my coffee table after receiving it. Everyone that comes over feels compelled to pick it up and look through it, and it does indeed seem to put a smile on the face of all!

B0042TV4IW|5.0|Good show no sex scenes or bad language good for the whole family. You fall in love with the characters
B00EO2I6XS|5.0|If you are not interested in philosophy or in grand questions such as, how can humans commit almost unimaginable acts of inhumanity? then you should not bother with this film. You very well might be, as one reviewer wrote, \\"bored to death.\\"  But if questions of this magnitude interest you, then there might not be another author who explores them with more intensity of focus than Hannah Arendt. This film merely skims the surface of her exceedingly complex and often misunderstood philosophical interpretation of Eichmann's crimes. The subject of this film is the social controversy surrounding her initial publications of her theory about Eichmann and the Holocaust. However, the ambition of the film must also be to bring attention to Arendt, one of the most talented philosophers of the twentieth century, and who, like most women of genius, is usually given short shrift in favor of less talented male counterparts. The acting is so perfect that I remained haunted by the characters. There are many other strengths as well: the script, beautifully folding in Arendt's relationships, including her friendship with Mary McCarthy; the sets of her apartment and classroom; the footage of Eichmann. But I think one of the final touches of insight was to have no real ending to the film thereby reminding the audience that the inquiry into the large questions tackled by Arendt will always remain open and unfinished.
B00992CF6W|5.0|awesome I love it but get Pc verson it has way more stuff and endless worlds. plus villagers and bosses so this ones ok

B00FPGSPQU|1.0|Was so disappointed, they should have stopped at the second movie. This one dragged and was mean did not like would not recommend.
B006LSZECO|1.0|I have seen this book on the best sellers for a long time and when I heard they were going to make a movie of it, I thought, &#34; hey, if Ben Affleck thought it was good, why not read it?&#34; I  didn't particularly like the way the story jumped back and forth between the two characters, especially when they were on two different timelines. I will say that the author did a fine job of making you hate the characters. I like reading books where I like at least one of the main characters. I was rooting for Nick for most of the book and that kept me reading, but he sorely disappointed me at the end. I kept trying to figure out how he was going to redeem himself and he doesn't ! Hopefully Hollywood will change the ending in the movie. I would recommend that you wait for the movie release ( Ha!, the old Nick would love that!)that way if you don't like it at least you only wasted a couple hours of your leisure time

B000FC1CYG|4.0|I enjoyed the challenge of keeping up with the rhythm of the mid-19th century prose.  The twists and turns of the story and final triumph of the working class was very effective.  The resemblance of Conin-Doyle's Holmes is very evident.  Good for writer Collins
B008RA3X5E|3.0|Suited the need while I was on the road, but the Kindle does not fall asleep while it is active & if you don't have the quick charger with you & plugged in it will drain the battery which would negate the effectiveness of it as your battery will be dead & the alarm will never go off.

B00006AUIG|5.0|I love this movie ! All the actors are good, and most importantly, the script is very clever. I like the fact that it lets your mind draw it's own conclusions,without using any &#34;CG' magic.The sound of the Patients interviews on the reel to reel tapes playing in the background,and old Wheelchairs is so creepy.Great under rated scary movie ! And Oh Yeah, it stars David Caruso !
B008673ZAQ|4.0|I have never seen a love so chaotic, confusing, sensual, or intense then what was so well displayed in Sylvia's writing. There were so many point in this story where I was left just as frustrated and flustered as Eva and then at the same time your could help but believe with all your heart the Gideon loved her beyond space, time, or measure. This type of passion is one we women only dream of and for a very short time I was able to live it, vicariously through Eva and Gideon.<br />The writing brought the events of this story to life. The words practically jump off the pages and into my souls. I am a sucker for a good crazy romance story.

Forest Gump, the central character is born with physical and mental issues which he overcomes with the help of his mother, his childhood sweetheart, (Holly), and the friendship of two fellow marines. We see Fortest  and Holly in the midst of crisii which griped the whole country during this era:  from the war in Vietnam, the integration of public schools,  the 'hippie movement & drugs, the beginning of the Black Panther Party, the Watergate scandal, and even hurricane Carmen's destruction of the southern coast. Because Forest takes verbal comments literally to heart and never gives up, he unwitt

B000JMKQX0|5.0|I'm not a book critic, and I don't want to be. I don't read books as an academic study. Maybe I'm comparing two different fruits here, but I took a &#34;Hispanic Films&#34; class once, and my &#34;tests&#34; were to watch a movie with 10 other students (it was the only elective available for us all, I'm sure) while the professor paused every five minutes and asked us questions about, say, the significance of this character/story was versus the time period, or what the director was trying to say about the camera movements in a particular scene.  Sure, sure, it was all very scholarly and I felt like a big shot when I got some oohs and ahhs repeating those philosophical and chin-scratching make-you-go-hmm tidbits to my friends and family.<br /><br />But you know, I have to admit that I prefer to watch my movies and read my books as entertainment.  Sure, I love reading all the people complain or criticize how the author didn't do this or that, or that the story wasn't how they'd have written it, or that characters are this instead of that, etc, etc.  Here's how I look at it - In the end, was the book able to grab my attention well enough to make me want to read it all the way to the end? If it did, I'm satisfied.  That's it.  I'll let all the other people do the fact-checking, or write up analyses, or post those super hilarious You-Tube reviews.<br /><br />So as a person who likes to read books for fun, this book earned its place on my shelf.  I for one, enjoyed the way the book was written - in a post-event, interview style. As each character was interviewed about their experience, the reader is able to take that journey back with them.  You're hearing/reading the story as subjectively told by the survivors based on their own experiences and biases, which makes each story extremely human and believable, whether it's the story of the old blind man in the mountains of the Japanese islands using his spirituality as a source of strength, the front-line American soldiers dealing with the constant and most-decidedly unconventional threat, or the politician(s) having to live with their difficult decisions.  It's not that they simply shared an experience that makes for a well-rounded story, it's that their individual experiences were also shaped by everything that makes that character unique - nationality, culture, personal beliefs/attitudes, and on and on.  It was this underlying interconnectedness between everything that made the book interesting to read.  Each of these characters survived the same apocalypse in vastly different, but yet many of the same ways.  And just like in times of real disaster, this book shows us that there are very few happy endings, just continually less-tragic ones as humanity struggles to not only rebuild, but to understand.

1937986039|5.0|Having purchased an X20 and found the Fuji manual adequate but lacking, I decided to try this book in the hopes of more than a little application to the X20.  First of all, this is a complete, easy-to-understand, well illustrated guide to the X10.  I have gone through this book page-by-page with my X20 in hand, twirling knobs and fooling with the menus.  In my opinion, it is 90% applicable to the X20.  BTW, I am not 'an enthusiast'--whatever that means--just a guy who owns one camera at a time and takes photos.

B0030Y11XS|5.0|As a filmmaker, Michael Moore is hit and miss. When he's on, as in his award-winning 1989 breakthrough film &#34;Roger and Me,&#34; his righteous outrage produces brilliant social commentary. When he's off, as in &#34;Fahrenheit 911,&#34; he comes across with self-righteous anger that fails to find a coherent message. But he's always interesting and fun to watch when he doesn't diverge from the path of reason into ideological crankery. The 2009 film &#34;Capitalism: A Love Story&#34; is one of his more restrained and hence better efforts. Tapping into popular outrage over the 2009 U.S. economic crash, Moore deftly elucidates and dispenses with the economic self-delusions that got us into the problem int he first place. In fact, this film may well be Moore's best, and could even be seen as a sequel to &#34;Roger and Me&#34; inasmuch as it revisits a lot of the same places (Flint, Michigan) and themes of his first major film, explicitly acknowledging it as its forefather. But Moore has gone further here, revealing more of himself than ever before, particularly his Catholic upbringing and conscience as instigators of his passion to fix our broken economic system. He assembles an impressive parade of priests and religious figures here to back up his social justice message, but he also shows his strengths as a grassroots filmmaker by telling the stories of hardworking American families who have lost homes to foreclosure due to the selfish overreaching of corporate power brokers that infects our current system from the top-down. His factual analysis of how the interest rate system preys on the simple and innocent through mathematical shell games is particularly inspired. This film is not to be missed if you want to understand more of the roots of our current U.S. economic woes -- and how a Catholic conscience inspires one to redress injustices.
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|Thank you so much for the update, I can now play CC on my Toshiba Vibe tablet without it crashing on startup! It's good to be back in the game full force. Am loving the graphics and neat little goodies you've added.

B000TGCR38|5.0|I just happened upon this movie. Upon watching it, I quickly bought it the next morning. I love WW2 history and this story is one that is unlike others that I have seen. Exceptionally well written and shot, the acting is just as exquisite. This story is the best of all realms, it is historical, romantic, dramatic, and always keeps you guessing. Just when you thought you figured it out, it changes- it is a real thinker! I would watch it over and over again; and now I can. I have spread the word of this movie to everyone that I know and now I hope that this helps others want to enjoy it as well. I honestly do not understand negative reviews of this film. The war was violent, and the movie would not be the same without that and the romance. Please enjoy!
034580404X|1.0|Ok. Yes, it was a good reads but for this series to published in three books is really redundant. If the author has taken the ridiculous dialogues, the sex scenes which are over the top this book would have been published in one book. But NO. It was already ridiculous enough that Ana subjected herself to some kind of humiliation by hooking up with an unrealistic character (he's 27y.o., very good looking, has enormous penis and a billionaire which he acquired by himself). On top of that, who would have believed that this girl is a virgin? Also the writing was so bad, e-mails, text messages are poorly written (which I understand, given the generation we have right now) but the story? It's literally scattered, like the main characters are talking about one thing then don't resolve the issue but have sex instead, then have another issue on top of the other. Every page, I read Ana either say, \\"Oh,\\" \\"Oh my,\\" \\"Oh crap,\\" \\"Holy s***,\\" \\"S***,\\" \\"Jeez.\\" The sex scenes? They're ok, only that in the end, the author put so many that I was literally scanning through the book just to get to the main points. Yes you can read this book, but don't buy it. It's not worth the money. Just go to your local library if they have it or borrow it from someone else you know who unfortunately owns it.
B0089LOG02|4.0|Orphan Train, by Christina Baker  Kline, gives a view of an event in American history that very few Amercians are likely to be aware of, the shipping of orphaned children from the streets of New York to the Midwest.  Many actually became indentured servants, working on farms, sewing, and serving as maids to those who took them in.  Yet , in spite of their hard lives, many seem to have accepted and adjusted to their lives, or fled from them.  It seems that many of these children matured and grew into happy, and content adults, fortunate enough to raise children of their own with many living to see their grandchildren.  This novel focuses on the life of one such child, a girl named (ultimately) Vivian, who was an Irish immigrant from New York City, and the journey that her life took, until, as an old woman she meets a kindred spirit in a teenager named Molly who has had a difficult life of her own.  These two bond and it is this bonding that reveals Vivian's life history, and helps Molly to deal with her own troubled life.  I found the novel to be well written, and emotionally gripping.  It has encouraged me to look into this part of our American history in greater depth.
B009JZSC9S|5.0|Superbly written. I can't stop watching it.<br />You can't go wrong with Julianna Margulies, Chris Noth and Christine Baranski. The casting is flawless. A+<br />If you're on te fence about watching it; watch it.
B005ZOBNOI|5.0|A masterpiece. It starts off slow but after the 20th page I was so hooked, I stayed up all night reading it. Beautiful, it's absolutely beautiful.
B00A6CCF0K|5.0|Once again Stephen King delivers a novel that will grip the readers attention from the very first page and on through to the very last. Not only was I fervently awaiting the new story to unfold as I turned each page, I also felt like there was an old friend lurking right on the fringe of each passage. No spoiler here....read Doctor Sleep, and then go back and lose yourself in The Shining. But a WARNING.....do it when you have some free-time, I couldn't put it down.
B0062NAX1U|5.0|Great movie! Get your tissues out though! Its a tear jerker but a good one! Love these type of movies!
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|Thank you...I love it I can finally play on my Kindle!  I love the fact I can now play with my Facebook friends.
B00FGLNZX2|5.0|I cannot think of anything better than listening to Yuja Wang's take on Rachmaninov on the Piano with Gustavo Dudamel conducting. Lucky enough to have listened to Dudamel conduct in LA, I jumped on the chance to purchase This MP3 on the best source, Deutsche Grammophon. Highly recommended.
B002VECM6S|4.0|Wish there was a number 2. Loved it definetely made me tear up. Great plot and Sandra bullock was hilarious
B00A6CCF0K|5.0|Loved it! I will never look at an rv park the same. I couldn't put it down.  I'm recommending this book to every one I know.  Great knowing what happened to little danny!
B0065V6B0Q|5.0|At last, a proper blu-ray version of Tess which isn't  hacked up and edited. This German import DVD played on my inexpensive Panasonic blu-ray player without a hitch (I live in the USA). The picture and sound quality are MUCH better than the lame DVD of this film released several years ago. The blu-ray plays in English and I didn't notice any problem with voice-image syncing. Altogether a great purchase. The seller I purchased thus blu-ray from shipped promptly with no problems.
B00F8H0LM2|2.0|This game is very challenging, which is normally a good quality in a skill-based game. However, it proved too difficult for me to navigate, especially on my current tablet which would overheat and freeze in the middle of play.
B00CRMX53S|5.0|I have always liked listening to daft punk songs and this song is definitely another hit for them. The beat is amazing.
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|I try not to get caught up in games but my daughter kept begging me to do this one so I did.  I just love it.  I use it as my treat when I get all my work and business done.
B009ZQC7MY|5.0|The acting, the storyline, the costumes - all so wonderful.  I watched the entire season 3 in one sitting.  Gripping  I can't wait for season 4 to begin!
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|It is about time they brought the REAL Candy Crush to kindle. It's just as good as the original. It seems they changed the level play a bit to. I don't feel like I have played them before and I am on the 200s on my other one. I just hope they start bring ok Nguyen more of the face book games to kindle.
B00AKL1XPU|5.0|I just started this game and I find it very enjoyable. It's very easy and stress free. I can't wait to rescue more animals.
B008YRVW0I|4.0|Easy to play. Relaxing to watch. Fun to create tanks of fish and accessories. Several levels to conquer. Easy to hard. You will like this game especially if you like fish. And it's on the order of candy crush.
B0032CVAQQ|5.0|A lot if wisdom in a concise well thought out little book. Like decades if counseling experience boiled down to its essence.
B00DJFIMW6|4.0|It was a really fun and creative app,  but it kept deleting my progress so it was a bit annoying.
B00FN811SY|5.0|best app ever,thank you very much.Use it every day,hopefully they will have on other languages soon! it works very good on all of my devices.
B005CGI4EG|4.0|It' great to be able to watch episodes I did not catch in the 11 year's this series ran. I missed a lotof them & saw some reruns on satellite. Still some I have not seen & with 261 episode on 32 disc (aprox. 5962 minutes)- it may take a little while to go thru all the episodes. I also liked the price at Amazon. I purchased the new package for $32.01, but if you wish, there are used available. Shipping was free with tracking & arrived in about 6 days via fex-ex parternship with USPS. If you live in the country where you get mail in your roadside box like me- plan on making a trip to the post office. The  packaging could be better. When you remove the disc holder from the box, it folds open like a book with 16 disk on each side with a cardboard retainer. One the back of the box, Sony has glue a label with the names of all 261 episodes. This is only about 5&#34; X 8 1/2&#34; and a little hard to read. Also there is no closed caption<br />so if you are hard of hearing like me you might have to turn the TV volume up. I still would have purchased this product dispite the package & no closed caption. Lot's of viewing time for your enjoyment!
B0084B5TK8|3.0|I'm glad I read this book but I'm not sure if I would ever read  it again. It's kind of a long book and I feel the story could have been told in less pages.  It's interesting to see where the legend of Dracula came from. There are tedious parts of the book, but I recommend giving it a go.
B0031TZ8TU|5.0|An amazing story with amazing characters.<br /><br />Being a true story gives other interest to the book, very well written. A good Reading even if you are not an American.
0007274939|5.0|This book is a very comprehensive guide to survival. I am going to be studying this in depth. I had seen this book referenced quite a bit in my research. Now I now why.
B006MW3UZW|5.0|Awesome show. A glimpse in time of the rich and famous. A look at the servants from a perspective that one doesn't see much.
B00CHS31DG|5.0|This is my third updated version of Ghost Radar and I like it. More of the information is all on one screen. The vox would be the main drawback for me as it is so much smaller than the previous one but all in all okay. I do have fun with this ap. Some nights it is so &#34;wordy&#34; and very quiet at other times. It's always interesting and you are never sure what is going to show up or be said. At times it seems almost eerie as the words make sense, Then there are times the words are so random it means nothing but overall very entertaining. Give it a try!
B006GWO5NE|5.0|i made the mistake of not buying my kindle hd from amazon, so the charger i bought was $150.00,and let me tell you it's never fully charges my kindle and this of course is great..because it is made for the kindle and it works great
B00E8B1P9M|5.0|I grew up in the 80's and when I found out they were making GI Joe movies I was more than excited to see them!  The acting was great and so was the special effects!  These movies have been added to my library!
B00AREIAI8|5.0|Awesome good game and I love horses and live near at least five horse farms.<br />It's never blurry or ever glitches for me.
B00BMNM4H6|2.0|I might have enjoyed it if the instructions were better. I wasn't doing well minus those and uninstalled it after about a dozen tries. So maybe if one can figure out it would be fine but I didn't get it.
0385537816|5.0|my daughter-in-law has read her's 8 times and i have read my set 3. it is a good book just get away from everything and just read..
B00ECUARO8|5.0|We rented this movie and I wish that I had bought it!  I love Matthew McConaughey anyway and this was another really great movie of his!
B0063GORYU|4.0|I love this version of spider solitare because of the graphics and the on  tap card options. It's a nice  game to play on a rainy day or just to relax.
B0064MPXFA|4.0|This is a great show.  I used to watch &#34;Murder One&#34; which was a great show that was cancelled after the second season.  I happened to sit down and take time to watch this program and I really, really like it.  It has the same kind of suspense as Murder One only with a woman as the lead character.  I love lawyer flicks and shows and this one is a winner!
B007EC27QM|1.0|This isn't a top 25 essential app. It's a basic calculator that's not very good. For ex. 7 - 5 x 10 = 20 isn't correct. It's - 43. Get Realcalc scientific calculator from the Google play store. It's way better and you can actually use it for other calculations other than add, sub, div and mult. Plus it's free.
B00FPH6A70|5.0|Loved how this was scary and interesting!  Was a little confused in the beginning but then almost half way through I understood!
B005K17RU0|4.0|Gives you up to date weather and notification of severe weather.easy to set up I have tried many we w their apps this is the only one I have been satisfied with
B00CLD65X0|5.0|Wonderful wonderful series.  If you haven't seen this, you're missing out..  start watching and you will understand why.  You will be hooked.
B002NWXRYY|5.0|Housesitter is quite possibly the funniest movie you never heard of. It wasn't really a very big hit when it was released. For the most part I don't really care for Steve Martin but there are two of his films that are a must for my library and this is one of them (The other being &#34;All of Me&#34;). Goldie Hawn is hilarious as she cons an entire town, posing as Martin's wife, much to his chagrin. At the same time she has some of the most poignant lines ever uttered by a character in love. &#34;I found him and I saw what he was worth and I love him! (emphasis on the &#34;I&#34;) Mind you, I may be misquoting but that is the general idea. (poor memory)<br /><br />I rarely give a movie four stars and five is almost unheard of so you KNOW this one is a keeper!
B00EY8BRGU|5.0|What an amazing movie this was!  I wish I had purchased it and I will be asap!  If you love magic then you have to see this movie!
B00A0SQBDM|5.0|This game keeps me going for hrs. Intriguing. Helps pass the time. Has many places to hide objects. The perfect game.
B00A6CCF0K|5.0|Excellent follow-up to The Shining.  I really enjoyed this book from start to finish! I haven't been thrilled with many of his books of the past few years, but when he gets it right, it's like coming home again.
B0058UXHHK|5.0|I really enjoyed this book, but it is a series and I totally missed that part. I enjoyed all the action and the constant surprises at every turn. It was super fun to read and when I save up a few more $`s hopefully I can purchase the next ones.
B00FEN1C50|5.0|My kids and I loved this movie!  So glad we bought it because it is one of those movies you can watch over and over and not get sick of it!
B0026O475M|4.0|One of Tom Hanks great films. Most of it is done solo for him but the parts before he is stranded, while he was stranded, and after rescue are fabulous.
B00C2GJWNG|4.0|Refreshing sound from a young musician. Looking forward to hear subsequent recordings from this artist. Recently saw clips of him performing at this year's Isle of Wight festival. While this album is predominately acoustic, he was laying down some nice blues licks on electric at the show.
B005K17RU0|4.0|This app works very well for me.  I really like having weather information at my finger tips anytime day or night...summer or winter.
B00EL8JCGU|5.0|Well I love zombie movies and so of course I had to see this one!  But I also love Brad Pitt!  So this was a double love for me!  I truly liked how they made this zombie movie different from the rest!  Well worth it!  If you love zombies you will love this one!
B00C2IJJE6|5.0|One of my favorite films ever made. Great stories, great acting, and great settings. I have been a tall, similar man to Tim Robbins in this film so maybe that's why I identify with it so well. This is another one I can watch over and over.
B00F35BV64|3.0|I have to say that I didn't enjoy this one as much as the first one. I know a lot of women were all gaga over it just because of Benedict Cumberbatch being in it, but he's not attractive enough to bump this above 3 stars. LOL I'd really prefer to see this new Trek franchise BE a new Trek franchise and not take the incredibly lazy route of re-telling stories the original has already told, but just changing little things here and there. Otherwise we're doomed to have a modernized version of The Voyage home. Please, dear gods, NO!!! I think we can all agree that we can do without that.
B00E1L9N8E|5.0|I would recommend this movie to everyone over 18. I found it a great movie about friendship. Forbidden love. Betrayal. And a little suspense at what he does for a living.
B009ZQC7MY|5.0|I love that there is not tons of violence or sex and I cannot wait for season 4 to start in January 2014!  I recommend this series to everyone, even young people.
B001992NUQ|4.0|When you see the title of Fight Club, it looks like total violence. There is much but not guns and ammo just good ole bare knuckle brawling. The ending leads to some humor and revelations so if you have seen it and like it, it's worth buying.
B00F91RYL8|4.0|I'm not a huge Brad Pitt fan, but this movie was fun. The crazy fast, chittering zombies were awesomely creepy and all of the people who played them for the close-up scenes should be getting awards for their incredible ability to pump up that creep factor. I liked this one enough to add to my collection alongside 30 Days of Night and 28 Days Later.  :-)
B00FEHXCIG|5.0|I like all the Iron Man movies. I thought this one was a little better. Perhaps because the trouble comes to his home. He did invite the bad guys over. He gave them his address and they showed up.
B003O86MY8|5.0|David has created music on this album for everyone.  His joy in playing each piece is evident. His love for the music he creates transforms each song into something that's not to be missed.
B00EIBO8UK|5.0|We already had it in DVD but the deal in blu-ray was great so I moved up. Fine film, and she is very happy. The little ornament that comes with it i cute too.
B009ZZDNT6|5.0|This is a pretty cool app. Great alarm sounds, somewhat easy navigation, etc. The alarm plays no matter what, and when you type in your pin, the app automatically opens so u can press snooze or turn off the alarm.<br />  There is a paid version. I probably will never get it, because though I would love to wake up to Lindsey Stirling, it's not worth a dollar. I think that's the biggest upgrade (being able to use music on your Kindle) if not the only. If another &quot;upgrade&quot; is no ads, the ads are slits on the bottom. I can deal with &quot;Google Chromebook&quot; ads on my alarm clock app.<br />  So, even if a dollar means nothing to you, I say start with the free version :)
B008SAZHLQ|2.0|So many people raved about this book that I was surprised when I didn't like it. I wanted to use it for our high school book club but I can't. I didn't like the characters, the drama was cliche and the references to the time period were gratuitous.
B00CSCJ09K|5.0|Fabulous violinist, fabulous music.  I Love his passion for the violin and the music he creates. I recommend this for everyone. Once you hear it you'll be hooked!
B008C2GVUG|5.0|I was a broker for over 30 years and had many clients, knew brokers, and went through must of what they show in the film. &#34;Greed is Good&#34; is a great quote that comes from the film but Greed can get deadly and lead to jail for some. Many should be in jail and aren't, but they do pay.
B000RJO578|5.0|First of all, the direction of the movie was fantastic.  the writing was superb and the acting was very good as well.  overall, this movie is just all around brilliant.  i have to warn people that it's a dark comedy with some dark moments, but on the whole its very funny.
B004DLPXAO|5.0|Awesome App.  I am so thrilled to be able to read on my phone,  It also uploads to place I left off regardless of what location I was reading on previously....pc or android it syncs..yeah that's the word.  Love this App
0060763280|5.0|Love this book.  It is to the point, very understandable and really gives one the feeling you can create a 'Millionaire Mind'.
B001AQT0RC|4.0|Blu-Ray is always the best and if the film wasn't worth seeing it more than once I wouldn't purchase it. Everyone is into streaming but owning the actual parts are the best way to do it. If you wish to stream you can set it up through VUDU and stream away. Great film and Blu-Ray.
B000063K5W|5.0|Exceeded all my expectations. Came quicker than i could have anticipated. Perfectly wrapped and condition was great. It played awesome and still continues to be decent.
B00ATDOVNK|4.0|It's hard to put Down. Makes you want to know what's next. It challenges your powers of observation. Loved it.
B00A6CCF0K|4.0|I enjoyed this quite a lot.  It was scary, but not &#34;The Shining&#34; scary, which was good for me since I'm older now and probably more prone to heart attacks.  Really enjoyed the main characters.  Scariest part was that everything is all so possible and believable.  I guess it's because the most horrible things in life are often the things that appear so normal.
B00AEFXEN6|5.0|I only buy the greatest films that I know of in Blu-Ray, that way I can watch them when they really mean something to me. This is one of them. All men have been in one of these situations and women too. Watch it, learn it, love it, live it.
B00E89VXQY|1.0|I gave it a One Star because it fails to have Metallica's \\"Through The Never\\" song on the Soundtrack that's titled \\"Through The Never\\"!!! If you're going to release an album at least be consistent in the theme and concept.
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|Finally!!! I have been playing this game on my phone, but the screen is so small. Browsing through the apps yesterday and saw that it was the real deal Candy Crush Saga, my fingers immediately pressed the &quot;Get App&quot; button. So excited it's finally on Amazon!!!
B00499NHLC|5.0|Nice when a TV show does not cater to a formula. Love the dysfunction of the characters and how they play off each other.
B002WYJHBA|5.0|We all would like a &#34;Do over&#34; but we often wonder what we would do if we had it to do knowing only what we knew when we did it the first time. Probably exactly what we did before. Great film, love the color to black and white, then back to color. Another movie we can watch several times.
B00BNGFGIQ|4.0|This game is so much fun and challenging. I am having a ball playing it. I can't stop playing it.
B001P7HUF0|5.0|A good movie, made after a good book. Matt Damon at his best and Grisham at his finest! I enjoyed every minute of it!
B00AZMFJYA|4.0|I gave this Star Trek Into Darkness only 4 stars because it seemed that there was more action than story.  As long as Chris Pine heads the Enterprise, I will continue to watch every Star Trek he is in.  I think he's the perfect Captain Kirk, and do enjoy the new frontiers they seem to delve into.  The first Chris Pine Star Trek was lighter and, as the title captions &#34;into darkness&#34;, darkness is not my favorite to watch.  Add to that more action than story, and I'm not making it one of my favorites.
B00C2ISGKO|4.0|Clint Eastwood nails it again with this film. The blu-ray is great, film is great and Blu-tay Steelbook is great. I actually bought a beer for Clint up when he was mayor of Monterey when we saw him out after a mayoral meeting. He is a fine gentleman. The film is a great story and blu-ray is the best.
B000YABYLA|5.0|i love this movie. so funny. i love the acting and the actress very much. dvd was great in all ways.
1444737112|5.0|Loved reading this book. I finished it in three reads. It's simple, sweet, deep, heartwarming and vibrant. A real life story of redemption, responsibility, love, tenderness and friendship. Bob and his sweet human are a match few have ever seen.
B00DHHWXYY|4.0|When I saw this movie in the theatre, the colors, the costumes, the party environment jumped right out at you.  All of the splendor and gluttony spending of the 1920's certainly is depicted perfectly in the life of the Great Gatsby.  Leonardo DeCaprio certainly plays the perfect host, even if no one recognizes him.  Tobey Maguire is his perfect sidekick.  The storyline perspective is that of Tobey as F. Scott Fitzgerald, observing life for the novel he will eventually write, \\"The Great Gatsby\\".  I was anxious to view this DVD on my giant 54\\" HDTV.  Even that screen size didn't pick up all of those glamourous gowns and costumes, or details of the homes' backgrounds...but I did enjoy the movie.  I didn't want to like it because I felt that Robert Redford's 1979 version made Gatsby the vision you would expect a gazillionaire to be.  Leo, however, really downplayed Gatsby's participation in his own parties, and actually underacted, which made his entire character stand out as a sympathetic character.  I really loved this movie and the story as it was told.
B000NQRE9Q|5.0|I wanted all of these in Blu-ray so here I went with the best way to get them. Great stories, well done films, many great actors, fine special effects. All of these stories we have lived, told, dreamed of in different manners for all of our lives. These will always been in our pockets for memories and to watch several times.
B0007OCG56|5.0|i love this movie very much. very touching. i purchased this movie as a gift years ago and it is still a favorite.
B00AB7HESI|5.0|This game is very funny and exciting to play. Mainly because you make up for our own adventure. Fell free to buy and enjoy this game
B0008ENICU|5.0|This 1939 classic is one of my favorites. The Women from 1939 bypassed all morale codes of their time: overspending, husband stealing, catty gossiping.  Oh, wait, that still goes on today.  Well, the over-the-top beauty salon, high style fashion show (in color!), are certainly fun viewing.  Add to that the trials and tribulations of the all good all the time, Mary, who believes that her husband will eventually tire of the jaded mistress that stole him away from her, and those so-called friends of hers that seem to change friendships as the situation moves along.  Current soap operas have nothing on this storyline. It's definitely a &#34;chick flick&#34;, because there are absolutely no men in this movie...even though they are the subject throughout.  Don't judge this 1939 version with the remake...This original can never be duplicated in drama, comedy, style and fashions, and a peek into the lives of The Women.
B00C2ISGRC|5.0|I hadn't seen the film for some time but after I watched it again, I knew why it was so great. Denzel Washington is fabulous in this film and the ending makes it even better. The Blu-ray Steelbook packaging is a great wat when storing the item but will take a bit more room. Only the finest films are on Blu-ray Steelbook so this one is good. I have become very disabled so spend much time watching films. I do what is good and what is bad. Trust my judgements.
B0009S2T0M|5.0|this is the best movie i ever watched. i love it so much that i purcahsed a copy for my grandpa and for me.
B004TI5N38|3.0|The lead in the book, Puller, seems like a guy with an interesting story to tell. That's what hooked me in chapter one. Puller reminds me of Jack Reacher, only he is still in the army and Reacher is more okay with who he is.<br /><br />The mystery started out well, and would have ended better if 50 pages had been cut out of the book. Before this book I've only read the author's King & Maxwell books (which I love), so I was missing the partnership aspect.<br /><br />Overall it's not a bad book, it' also not a great one either.
B008XG1X18|5.0|Finally, An App I Truely LOVE!!!'  If you are interested in anything make yourself  a board, Give it a Title  and have Fun!!!!
B00C2IPB70|4.0|The movie can be misleading and requires one to pay attention while watching. No texting or padding when watching this film. All great performances but you must like a bit of science fiction to enjoy this.
B009AMANBA|4.0|Daniel did a fantastic job of capturing the President's voice and mannerisms. Historically accurate. Good movie. If you love historical movies, this one would fit the bill.
B006X50OPW|5.0|You will learn a ton about the psychology of trading in an indirect way--reading about great men and their very often times frustrating journey  to success.
B00005KHJV|5.0|Halloween is by far the best horror film, that's my saying. When I purchase this extended edition I was like a child with a candy. I thought It was outrage to buy over 40 dollars or more for a brand new DVD so I end up buying used for 20 dollars, it was still alot of money for a used one but it was worth every penny. This extended edition was pack with never before scenes. When the DVD arrived and on time to, it look like brand new and when I played it the picture was crystal clear. I'm so happy to purchase this DVD.  ツ
076781326X|3.0|I bought it because I had seen the local production and I wanted to compare them.  I am not really a fan of this musical.  However the transaction went great with the seller.
B003B02O3C|5.0|I'm fairly certain I saw this when they made it into a movie way back when.  But as I read this novel recently, it was as if I were hearing the story for the first time.  I loved Rudy Baylor, loved his thoughts, loved his actions, loved his associates.  Every detail in this book was satisfying.  A completely believable David & Goliath story.  A superb novel.  I need to go back and read all of these earlier Grisham novels.  Not many authors out there with the talent of John Grisham.  I hope I can count on all of his novels leaving me this satisfied.
B00A6CCF0K|5.0|Being a Stephen King fan he has written another hit was really different  I enjoyed it very much.. would recommend it to everyone
B009ZQC7MY|5.0|Well written, perfectly cast, acting and cinematography are wonderful.  Great story line.  This series is definitely worth watching and will catch & hold your attention!
B00005RG6B|5.0|When CDs first came out, this was one of the first albums I bought, and I listened to it repeatedly and knew it line for line. It wasn't until tonight that I saw Operation: Livecrime for the very first time, and I was completely blown away! Seriously, that's almost an understatement - I don't think I've ever seen a live performance that was so electrifying, so full of intensity and passion - these guys left EVERYTHING - and I do mean *everything* up on stage. WOW. If you're debating as to whether or not to get this, don't waste a second and just hit \\"Buy Now\\" and get this thing overnighted - you're going to be rocking all over your house tomorrow, and you'll cue it up to watch it again. I know I will.<br /><br />Thank you Queensryche for the rock performance of a lifetime.

1250012570|5.0|Eleanor & Park by Rainbow Rowell was recommended from another blogger so I added it to the list at the library...not knowing anything about it.  She did tell me that it was a youth book but that was it.  I was interested to see why the reserve list at the library was so long and I had never heard of the book.  Not that this is totally uncommon because I don't seem to hear about books until years after they are out.<br /><br />The book started in August of 1986 with sixteen year old Park who was riding on the bus to school and trying to avoid all of the people who often start trouble.  Eleanor gets on the bus and no one wants to let her sit with them but Park finally moves over and lets her sit down.  Sitting on the bus and reading comic books  is the start to their friendship that develops very slowly because Park doesn't want to be linked to someone different because that might get him picked on.  He has spent his time in school keeping his head down because he feels that being Korean in an almost all white school makes him stand out enough.  Park is trying not to be noticed but by picking Eleanor as a friend with her bright red hair, funny clothes, and larger figure, he is bound to be noticed.  The two navigate through school together with a growing relationship sharing comics, music, and friendship while hiding from Eleanor's abusive step father while spending as much time together as possible.  Their small world blows up in an instant and both of their lives are changed forever.  I don't want to ruin the whole story but pick it up and I know that you won't be disappointed.<br /><br />I loved the book!!  The author really made you feel like you were in both characters shoes and understanding how their lives were going.  It makes me think back to my childhood and the experiences to try to fit in on the bus.  I think that it is one of those rights of passage because the young kids sit in the front and the middle school kids were in the middle and the high school kids in the back.  Of course, by high school I was living out in rural Maryland and the bus ride to school was over an hour so you had to figure out how to keep your head down or fit in because that was two hours of your day 5 days a week!!  I think that most people could find something to relate to in this book from their childhood and I think that it is a valuable book for young adults to read.  I would read it to review appropriate content before handing it over to my child but loved it as an adult.  I hope that you pick it up at your local library or bookstore (but be prepared for a wait because there are still 100 people in line to get the 17 copies at my library).
B00BGI08GG|5.0|I lov Arrow great cast and writers. I like the fact Stephen Amell does most of his own stunts. It's one of those shows u watch over and over again.
B0081336FO|5.0|love this version of Sherlock holmes.  you must pay close attention because they talk fast and have the british accent but it is worth it.
B003G4W49C|5.0|Second time I have read this. Very enjoyable.  Great first book to a series.  A must read book.  I loved it.
B00CS74W0C|4.0|Definitely four stars.  Thought it was only a trilogy, but turns out there is more to come. Would have liked to know that before starting to read it
B008Y212PI|4.0|I like this game, but you have to post a review to unlock bonus level. Still fun and addicting. Good.
B00CWY76CC|1.0|No way to figure this game out intuitively or with directions.  REinstalled it,  hoping there were improvements,  there are none.
B00821OX98|5.0|I've watched Season 1 & 2 and am waiting for season 3.  The acting is good.  The background and weapons are believable.  Spend a little time with it, see if it pulls you in.
0446547646|5.0|This book was one of the first ones by Nicolas sparks I had read.  I was amazed at how easy it was to read and enjoy; right from the fist page.  Within each of us there is a desire to read the romance books. This book is so special.  i will read it again and again. i have already read 4 other books by this author and they are all really good.  This one is my favorite. what a love that he had for her. The dream of every reader.
B004LQEYAG|5.0|I really enjoyed this movie and it is one of the greatest movies of the Century. The song Raindrops keep falling on my head captures this movie perfectly. The movie is not only extremely accurate but very entertaining. I highly recommend this movie to anyone.
B00A6CCF0K|5.0|Excellent book my the master of horror. I like how he is able to connect this book from athe Shining.  Dan Torrance older now makes you feel for him and what what he goes through in order to try and save Abra. It's a struggle of trying to stay alive and doing what he can to make sure it stays that way.
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|So unbelievably happy that Candy Crush Saga finally made it to the Kindle Fire. The game is a lot of fun and not having to connect with Facebook makes it even better for my children to also enjoy!  :o)
1455523550|5.0|I enjoyed this very much. I was not disappointed after reading it.  One thing I like about reading from this author; he has a love scene but it does not take over the book.  It is not a &#34;cheap romance book&#34;  as so many are these days.  A wonderful book of love and heartbreak.
B008Y212PI|5.0|Works well on Kindle Fire HD.  It's enjoyable to have a picture underneath the puzzle.  The small puzzles get you started and the larger ones really test your reasoning skills.
B00A8ECU24|5.0|Best game ever. My daughter Paris loves it so much she recommends it to every last one of her friends. It is super kid friendly and she is an expert at it. Who knew a child's game could be so good? Paris did.
B000683VI4|5.0|This is a movie classic. Beautiful and touching. Makes you cry no matter how many times you watch it. Just a wonderful movie and I will watch it again and again
B000ICKPOQ|5.0|I wish it lasted longer the 5 seasons, It could of gone on for another 5. I think they could do some sort of spin off maybe?
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|Have played on Facebook and finally can play on my kindle.  Very entertaining and great graphics, just like on the computer.  I like using the touch screen instead of a mouse. Great purchase!!
B003G4W49C|5.0|Amazingly well written. A great combination of political and social understanding. Incredibly catchy and easy to fall into. Great story
B003UESJH4|5.0|Great movie especially uplifting for people who have or who work with people with speech disabilities. I enjoyed every minute of it and watched it again and again.
B008RTE08E|5.0|Truly strange film. Truly excellent music! Truly funny moments, truly corny moments. Is exactly as it appears to be, random moments thrown together, made up as it went along, with songs littered throughout. I loved it!
034580404X|5.0|Loved the books.  I could have enjoyed without so much sex...nothing left to imagination for sure, but I loved the story line.
B000QCS8TW|5.0|Excellent book. Very long, over 800 pages, but well worth time and attention to detail. Fantasy not overwhelming but adds color to characters. Will definitely read book two and recommend to everyone who enjoys history. And detailed characters.
B007EECSFA|5.0|I don't even think I can't put into words how much I loved this book. Twist ending...WOW. I had to have a good cry after this one!
0440243688|2.0|Two  of the features of all the Reacher novels that I have grown to greatly dislike are the overly positive review and the white sugary plot synopsis published on the back of each Reacher novel.<br /><br />A Pentagon worker is riding on a NYC subway with two undercover government agents, an Afghan killer, another operative from an unknown government agency and Jack Reacher.  She has a secret that could bring down and permanently end the political career of a charistmatic war hero senator in Washington D.C.  Reacher gets involved because he thinks she is a suicide bomber, but she is really stuck between a powerful senator, who wants to protect his political career, a couple of unnamed government agencies who view this as a matter of national security, Jack Reacher who wants to help her, and the Afghan terrorists, who want the photo of the senator kissing Osama bin Ladin's buttocks on a secret mission from the Reagan White House to Bin Ladin's secretive camp so they can embarass and compromise the US government.  All of the players think that Reacher is holding onto the highly controversial photograph, but he only knows roughly where the pentagon worker threw the USB drive out of her car's window while on the way to take revenge on as many of the Afghan thugs for abducting, killing her son and then sending her the video of one of them slicing his belly and scooping out his intestines before leaving her son to die a painfully slow death.<br /><br />Gone Tomorrow is not a happy story.  It is over the top.
B007EC27QM|5.0|Love the history. Makes it so much easier to do multiple calculations without having to remember previous results. Large buttons and easy to read display is great.
B009VIZDLI|5.0|Hilarious, moving, clever - just an all out rollicking read. I really loved it. Best book I've read in ages.
159463176X|2.0|I really enjoyed two other books by this author and could not put those down but this one, I feel more like obligated to finish.  It just feels like too little of interesting story and way too much uninteresting introspection.
B00FWLDHSY|5.0|Awesome movie, tons of action and a great story line. Wish they would have made a prior movie showing just how it all started then made this one. Still great movie
0763644765|5.0|Love this book and my daughter really loves it! She doesn't like to sit on the potty much yet,but she'll sit while she &#34;reads&#34; this book to me a couple of times through.
B005NJU8PA|5.0|I highly recommend the book. It has been interesting to take the techniques in the book and try and apply them to real life. It has opened my eyes to food in a different way. I no longer feel like I have to have thousands of dollars in cookware or a professional kitchen to be able to cook well. Do not be intimidated by the size. After you get past the basics section you can jump around to the parts that are more interesting than the others.
B0089LOG02|5.0|Very interesting and compelling story.great fiction with historical setting. Well written, enjoyed the combination of  very different lives and insights into both.
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|This game is cool with tons of action. We like to run and dodge things while we get bananas. I would recommend this game.
B008JF8O9M|2.0|Did not connect to printer, could not find it. Only one app has been able to find the printer, but it uses a watermark on all the printed material.<br />This app doesn't work easily, maybe there is a way, but I can't find it.
B00DHKKN6Q|3.0|This game is super duper exciting fun! Whoop whoop! I wonder if they'll create a second one! Hope you enjoy!
B006LSZECO|5.0|This was my first Gillian Flynn novel and have now moved on to her other novels. I loved her style and the way we are able to see the different perspectives throughout the story. I enjoyed the ending but wish there was more.
B008XNZMOU|1.0|Having a singers voice doesn't necessarily conclude that the music will in return be good to the ears. There is a lot of drama and political ties that just touch me the wrong way. If you are into strong lovey dovey vibes and the almost forcing of holding hands type of music, then by all means, buy this album.
B0047VSW30|5.0|Hypatia's position in the pivotal conflict between early christianism, judaism, and the pre-christian gods of Rome is truly heroic and inspiring. That those who tortured and murdered her were later canonized as saints and \\"doctors\\" of the church speaks volumes about what was lost as the old gods receded and the new gods moved in.
B005PK57IK|5.0|Entertainment of this variety is a personal taste.  I really enjoy this show for it smart script and the quality of the various actors. I find with most TV drama i can consistently predict what is going to happen next, but that is not the case with this show, and I like that it is that way.<br /><br />If one enjoys sitcoms, and action drama this may not be your cup of tea.  If you prefer drama that cause you to think, then this may be for for you.<br /><br />Let me reiterate that we all have personal taste.  There is nothing wrong with enjoying sitcom an/or action drama.  For example my wife does and I personally think she is a terrific human being!
1416589473|5.0|I started reading this book not knowing what to expect of a novel about a game. Well.. it is awesome. it is described so real and the characters seem to get a life of their own when you play the game next to it. It is absolutely amazing! Glad i bougt it
B004GJYROG|5.0|Space Jam is an amazing movie!  It is family friendly and very entertaining for the whole family to watch. This movie is a must have!
B0015AARJI|5.0|Heard my friend bought a PS3 controller online here at Amazon for a reasonable price so I gave it a shot myself and I got to say, I'm pretty damn satisfied from how fast it shipped (faster than I expected) to the controller itself. However, I wished it came with a USB cable for charging/syncing purposes, but I got enough of those lying around so its all good on that end. All in all, great product and great service, look forward to doing business with these guys again in the future.
B00571F26Y|5.0|This is a very well written book. It is clear and honest. We have all been lead astray and our health has suffered. This book puts you back in the drivers seat and empowers you to believe you can have power back over your body. I read this book after reading Grain Brain and the two work nicely together. The book explains the genetic manipulation of wheat and the deterioration correlation with our health. It briefly talks about how food intolerances fit into it all. I would have liked more information on this and candida, but over all you finish the book knowing exactly what to do. There is a reference in the book to Taubes, Why We Get Fat and What to Do About It. I highly recommend this book for more research and to just hammer that last nail in the carb coffin.
B002ZDOXM6|5.0|I have always enjoyed listening to the Backstreet Boys. The range of their voices and the true feelings that come out with each word they sing is fantastic. This is a great CD to purchase if you love all of the Backstreet Boys top hits. I would recommend purchasing this CD.
B00B52FDXQ|5.0|I'm a Spartacus junkie. I hated to see the series end. I pre-ordered this item so I wouldn't end up making my collection complete. It was a nice surprise that when it was release the price was reduced and I received a discount. Most companies would have kept that as a profit. This item arrived as promised two days after it's initial release date and I'm so happy that my collection is now complete. Thanks again!!!
B0097EWK3A|5.0|I liked this game, took me a couple days and  liked that I could use the hint when stuck. If you like a simple mystery this is it.
031623480X|5.0|With my health on the decline and my memory slowly decaying, I was so relieved to find the link between carb, specifically gluten, and my mental decline. I have removed all carbs for a month and have been taking my supplements for a week. My energy levels are great, but yet to see a turn around mentally. It was also nice to have the food intolerances link, but would have been great to have more information on what happens if you consume these foods with all carbs removed. I highly recommend this book.
B0047Y0FGY|5.0|I picked up this book because everyone in my office had read it, and I'm so happy I did. This book is hysterical, I was laughing out loud through out the whole thing. It has some great stories about Tina's experiences on SNL and with 30 rock. I highly recommend it.
B00FAX6XQC|4.0|It i  very fun an  it i  easy to unlock th  gun  they giv  you side mission u can do if you get stuck so you can level up th  gun
B0099RFVXQ|4.0|Nice action movie. Enjoyed watching it with the kids. Would recommend it to everyone who like these marvel picture characters.
B00ATDOVNK|5.0|This game takes hidden object games to a new level. Like where is waldo on steroids. I had fun sharing this game with my daughter's we played many hours together
B007N579X6|5.0|Great price for great movie. My nieces and nephews love it. Looking forward on getting part 2 for my little love ones.
B005ZOBNOI|5.0|This book will leave you pondering the meaning of everything. I need time to actually register everything I just read.
B005GSZZ1A|5.0|While the brutality of the North Korean government is well-known, you really can't appreciate it until you hear about it from someone who has experienced it firsthand. The story that this book tells is as shocking as it is believable. I've always loved true escape stories such as this one. It ranks with The Long Walk, Five Years to Freedom, As Far As My Feet Will Carry Me, and The Colditz Story as one of my favorites.
B008P76VXU|5.0|Richard Wagner chose to describe his operatic creations as \\"Music Dramas\\". And the visual and singing aspects of his operas were vital to the overall appreciation of his works. In the special opera house, Festspielhaus, Bayreuth, Germany, that Wagner personally designed just for the production of his own works, the orchestra pit was covered in such a way that the orchestra could not be seen by the audience. This feature made his musical compositions even more prominent. This intense performance, without the staging and singing, provides an invaluable tool to the better comprehension of his mastery of orchestral arrangement and the emotional color that his music uses to enhance the experience of the audience. If you listen to this orchestral performance before approaching the operas in their entirety your understanding of the individual operas will be invaluably benefited.
B00F7YHDWC|4.0|For the level where we have to blow on the plane, we camt blow on kindle fire so i lose one life automatically
B005ZOBNOI|5.0|(And yes, I purposely did that)<br /><br />Ok, to start with; I've never been a fan of John Green, but this was something special :)<br /><br />Pro's:<br />Too many! But it was a book who DEMANDED to be cared about<br /><br />Con's:<br />The characters weren't 'real' teens, they were much too mature and the character's goals were sorta dull
B0089XH38M|5.0|Norton failed me and I got a huge virus.  A computer guru suggested this free antivirus.  So far so good.  Have recommended it to others.
B001UTW7QU|4.0|A very interesting if not weird show. Very well written with engaging characters. A few script continuity issues, but overall a good show. Has some good humor elements and good drama also.
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|I like this game because eney on can play it and it is a really friendly game. I love to play it.
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|Awesome game it's very fun and challenging. Best game I've seen for phone or iPad by far. All my friends play

B000PUV1ZI|5.0|Great movie.I loved it when I was a kid and rented it so my son could see it. Must see.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|This app is so fun when i let my sister play she buys stuff with coins but it is ok.
B00BMKDTNC|5.0|Rand, Mat, and Perrin. These are characters who have been with me almost half of my life. I always feared that Jordan would die and leave the epic unfinished. I couldn't have hoped for a better posthumous collaborator than Brandon Sanderson. All of the things that became repetitive and stylistically grating were eliminated when Sanderson took over. I was concerned about his ability to wrap things up in this final book, but this is a remarkable conclusion to a masterfully vast, sweeping, and grandiose tale. Tears. Satisfying, beautiful nerd tears. After 19 years, it was everything I hoped it would be.<br /><br />I'm as surprised as you are.
B003WUYRGI|5.0|It was very hard but interesting to learn other stuff like i have been trying to know my English and this book taught me better

B004RJMUJO|5.0|This app is real cool i like it and when I let people play my kindal they might play that game!
B006RJTEIC|4.0|Clean language and fairly good action. It's a good science fiction movie for the whole family. Some violence but not in the way contemporary films are today--pretty clean there. It was a fun to watch all these years later. As well, it was nice seeing the locations where it was shot in Dallas/Ft.Worth in and around the city as well as the Ft. Worth water works--a fabulous water park construction. The movies is old by today's standards but still wonderful.
B00AYB1RGG|5.0|Just one bad ass movie about a possible future for our country as anarchy is destined for our future if things don't change. This should have done much better in the box office because the movie is engaging, fun and downright testosterone and adrenaline filled fun.

B00BWQW73E|4.0|So here I was reading this book on my regular Kindle, occasionally switching to my Kindle Fire to check my email.  And while the MP3 player I bought on Amazon played Amazon downloaded music in my ear, I got to the part in the book where Jeff Bezos is wondering how companies become loved, and I seriously pondered that question.<br /><br />A company ought to be considered lovable to the degree to which it positively impacts people's lives.  Full disclosure: An Amazon imprint will soon publish my first novel and I was a finalist in the Amazon Breakthrough Novel Award contest--and that makes me love Amazon quite a bit.  Apart from my personal experience, I think Amazon is a boon to aspiring writers.  I would have liked more in-depth consideration in Brad Stone's book about how the literary marketplace currently is being transformed for both writers and readers. The discussion of Amazon's role in that transformation is spotty, though.  For example, the phenomenon of self-published e-books occasionally becoming bestsellers because of Kindle is left largely unexamined.<br /><br />This book had a lot to cover.  The style is readable and anecdotal, as it should be for the general reader.  I wonder, however, about the choice of what to include.  The author is obviously going for drama and human interest.  You will get Stone's version of what seems to be every argument between top brass in Amazon history.  There is also serious discussion of Amazon's strategy as a player in the national and international marketplace.  But some important topics are not touched on.  The treatment of Amazon Encore, the company's first book imprint, is too brief and that tiny bit is garbled. Uninvited, unknown writers don't just toss up their books on Encore.  (Question:  If that detail, so easily checked, is in error what else in Stone's book could be wrong?)  Why is there not a word about Amazon Vine?  Or about the innovative international literary contest Amazon runs every year?  That last omission is truly disappointing.<br /><br />I was happy to read about Jeff Bezos's serious interest in space exploration.  Like him, I'm old enough to remember being a kid thrilled as can be to watch men land on the moon.  The desire to explore is part of what makes us human, and I suspect private investors are going to have to carry space exploration forward into the next stage.<br /><br />This book presents one business journalist's partial view of a phenomenon, and I wouldn't stake my life on every word being accurate.  Still, it's a fascinating read if you're interested in Amazon.sion is truly disappointing.<br /><br />I was happy to read about Jeff Bezos's serious interest in space exploration.

B00BX8U0EE|5.0|As a HAWKWIND fan for over 40 years I have to say that Warrior on the Edge of Time is still my favorite. This release by the ATOMHENGE label is a real treat.<br />The sound quality is much better than the ROCK FEVER label release I (we) have had to settle for.<br />The violin/synthesizer(?)leading into The Golden Void is much easier on the ears. I give the remixes by Steve Wilson a big \\"Thank You !\\"<br />One example is the track Magnu. The track length is extended almost 2 minutes...and better yet...the 5.1 surround mix is fantastic.<br />This really brings out the individual instruments, particularly Nik Turner on sax. Check it out. I recommend this 3 disc package to<br />all HAWKWIND fans. ABSOLUTE MUST HAVE!!!
B00FAPF5U0|4.0|I've been waiting a long time for this to make it onto kindles. So addicted to this game. Only reason I gave a 4 and not a 5 is because some levels are ridiculously hard to beat. I also wish there was a casual mode so I can play without any goals.
B000O8OTNC|4.0|Smith quality and performance.  It does the job I want it to do.  I can't sharpen a knife to save my life...lol.  But with this item, I can keep my EDC blades sharp enough to do the job.  Again, you can't go wrong with a SMITH.
B003XF1XOQ|3.0|Pretty disappointed with the final book of the series. Expected better writing and story lines. Feels inconsistent with the first two books.
B001NLKXK2|4.0|I do not usually read stuff like this but found it interesting since 60 is around the corner, have had cancer and treatments and feel like my memory has let me down. Information was good to have also. Would recamend this book. Well written.

B009LDD590|5.0|The Boardwalk Empire is in itself is very entertaining historical fiction; it depicts a time that not many folks know about - the Prohibition years of the 1920's. It has a wonderful cast and magnificent set details - perfect date-night entertainment!.<br />If you liked the first three years you'll certainly not want to miss the third season. We bought the first two seasons on DVD, but decided to go with Blu-ray for the third. The images are truly beautiful as well as entertaining.
B000JIHP88|5.0|My son & daughter both loooooooooooved this. and the remote control was a godsend. Very happy to rate this. Excellent
0316228583|1.0|This book basically says life sucks, people are nasty and death is a release. It was too dark. My entire book club hated it! Look for better.
B005GY0Y8S|2.0|There were a bunch of mistakes in this book, very distracting. The overall plot was interesting but the characters' motivations were not explained well.
B00FAX6XQC|3.0|Cool game ....lots of variety ......really like the graphics and awesome effects with the infrared ...would recommend this game to my friends
B00FN811SY|5.0|All praise and glory to Jehovah.  I thanks the faithful slave for putting together this most helpful app.  Using this app out in service is a dream.  I love the way it shows the different translations, and the Greek to for the Greek Scriptures.  It is sooooo easy to read.  Thank-You
B00BRUQ7ZY|3.0|The historical context and time line from just before the time of Jesus to just after is absolutely fascinating.  His methodology for ascribing motives and beliefs to Jesus the man, however, is unconvincing.  He seems to have succumbed to the temptation of believing he can make up for a lack of facts by mere diligence, when in reality the metaphor he gives in the introduction is right on.  Describing the life of Jesus is like putting together a massive puzzle with most of the pieces missing.  MOST OF THE PIECES ARE MISSING.  There are some things we can never know and no matter how diligently you make up the missing pieces, you still made them up and any final conclusion can never be a factual account, but only a speculation of what might have been.<br /><br />  A more serious problem is that while reading the book I sometimes questioned the objectivity of the author.  He goes to great pains to explain why Jesus probably wasn't extraordinary and didn't likely come up with any ideas that were radically different from those of his contemporaries.  This is begging the question.  Of course the way to bet is that any given person is not extraordinary.  Extraordinary people are exceedingly rare.  That's why we call them extraordinary, yet occasionally an extraordinary person does come along.  His arguments suffer still more when he seems to accept that James, the supposed brother of Jesus, was quite extraordinary indeed.  I fear I detect a touch of sour grapes from a former biblical literalist evangelical, who never forgave Christianity for the shock of finding out that Noah probably didn't build an ark.
B004PGO25O|1.0|Just read The war of Art, not really anything new in this one and more in The War of Art
B003WUYOQ6|3.0|This book is well organized and well written. It seemed like the author wrote from mainly  a sociological point of view instead of a scientific point of view. He cited a multitude of research that seemed to dispute modern day scientific research but at the end of the day the foundation of his argument was, &#34;Today's accepted scientific reasoning about the healthy way to eat cannot be accurate because we're still fat and getting fatter.&#34;  The book is an interesting read and he makes a determined argument. I wanted to agree with him, but have had too much success eating a diet that is more in agreement with the American heart association.
B00FAPF5U0|1.0|I love playing these types of games but this game keeps putting me on hold for longer and longer periods of time. So glad it was free.  It is now uninstalled on my Kindle. Waste of good space.
B00E95ED32|4.0|The best track on the album is Lay Me Down by Adam Lambert.  That track and Adam  's vocals really rock. Not a fan of country and country vocal sound so only a few tracks were palatable to me.  LMD should be released as a single!!!!
B00DE76PM8|4.0|Useful when travelling. Can't figure how to delete a downloaded map that is no longer needed.  Would be even better if it could \\"bookmark\\" certain locations on downloaded maps and automatically select those maps and display the bookmarked map locations with a single click on a given entry in a list of saved \\"favorite\\" places.... this would enable the user to download the correct maps and \\"pre-program\\" the app in preparation for an upcoming trip.
B00ESLTEOU|5.0|Excellent!  I thoroughly enjoyed this version of Jane Austen's classic novel.  It is a wonderful story and beautifully illustrated. Enjoy!
B000SEGUDE|5.0|What an epic adventure through time and place!  Cloud Atlas is six different novels in one-- six different fully-imagined worlds, with dialect, characters and description completely unique, one from another.  I saw faint connections throughout, between characters and circumstance; mostly references to locations or vocabulary.  The language is as masterful and imaginative as the storytelling.<br /><br />Cloud Atlas is a book that will stay with the reader long after the last page is turned.  It us truly extraordinary.
B0050DZN4K|5.0|I have tried a few different services to manage RSS in the wake of Google Reader shutting down, and none have matched the convenience and ease of use that the feedly web service and app represent.
B00DYEBM3I|5.0|It has been a long time coming and with a touch of country Hope still shines like the star she is. Thanks for coming back to our eyes and ears
B00FKTDKTO|4.0|This is the best new material from Paul McCartney in the last 20 years! I was pleasantly surprised at not only the music but the lyrics also. Shades of old Beatle material appear throughout the CD but in a good way. Much better than Memory Almost Full or Flaming Pie. This is one that I will listen to more than a few times.
B005ZOBNOI|5.0|I don't typically read young adult novels, but this one came highly recommended. I'm glad I gave it a chance. It features smart, likeable characters that give us the opportunity to view the world through the perspective of teenagers with cancer. Such a description may make this novel sound like a downer, but its not - its uplifting. John Green developed characters that we enjoy, learn from and respect.
B0000041LL|5.0|I have changed my thoughts on Beethoven's string quartets after listening to the interpretations by Quartetto Italiano. They bring out the sweet, subtle, passionate nature of the music as well as the dramatic force. Unlike other performers, these pieces sound as if a single instrument is playing. The beauty reaches right to my heart and brings tears to my eyes.
B00ESF285S|5.0|This is a very favorite book mine that I have given over and over to graduating seniors that were very special to me when I was teaching.
B004T4LUPW|4.0|Recently purchased this app and I like the idea of having my calendar available on line &/or on my Kindle  So far have found it very user friendly & convenient.
B00DJYKFXG|1.0|I was fortunate to attend both the 12/28 & 12/30 shows. And although I have purchased all previous versions of these shows (some of the best live shows among many in my concert going lifetime), I once again spent my $$$$ in anticipation of the advertised DVD of the 12/30 concert (where I sat in the first row conversing with Michael J Pollard who was sitting in the pit). So instead we get 2 grainy songs in actual footage with the balance the same songs as the CDs while we are privileged to watch a loop of a powerpoint slide show. So we have Robbie again milking the leagcy of one of the greatest RnR bands ever. Shame on him. Richard, Rick and Levon, especially, I'm sure are rolling over in disgust. So save your money on this rip off box set and just listen to the original CDs.
B000W23H8S|5.0|This one may not be my favorite Police album, but it is a much cleaner version than the original CD mastered in the early 80's.
B0070Y46UY|2.0|I saw the movie at a church gathering.  Great for discussion but very slow moving.  Now someone is doing the book for Book Club.  I would never pick it up for relaxing reading, but for a thoughtful discussion I think it will be very good.  It does do a lot of repetitive listings of ideas.  Not one of those books you want to never put down.....
B006MW3UZW|4.0|The story always manages to rise above aristocracy and treats people as they would want to be treated. Very funny grandmother and you don't want to miss what she has to say!
B0094K1PW4|5.0|Wife and I really enjoyed it.  Ending was great. and If  my kids were still living at home, they would've enjoyed it too! :o)
B00EXVZW6E|4.0|Am enjoying the different choices for each level. I love HO games. This one is definitely fun, give it a try!
B008P1EWIM|5.0|This app gives accurate weather information wherever you are at the time.  It has a lot of info as to weather details in any area to ask for information on.
B007EC27QM|5.0|It's a great free app of the day &amp; would be worth its normal cost if you just want some nice PLUSSES over the stock calculator. I wrote that all-caps because before writing this I looked back to see what the low reviewers found that I might have missed. Most of them complain that it doesn't have more advanced features like a scientific calculator. It's not called calculator advanced.<br /><br />So what makes it plus? I'm comparing to the stock calculator on my EVO4G LTE, not to other apps in the market, btw.<br /><br />It has a few features that are quite nice for using in daily life (as opposed to college or business life)<br />One is how the percent key works. If you tip 20% it's faster to figure it in your head (10% *2) less or more tho &amp; this app is handy. You just enter your bill amount, hit + then enter the percent you wish to tip fpllowed by the % key. It calculates the tip amount, placing that number in the equation then hit = to add the numbers together.<br /><br />You can copy the result of your calculations with a long-press (if I recall correctly) to paste in elsewhere.<br /><br />I like the way the memory keys work &amp; that it faintly displays the number stored in memory above the  main display<br />Swiping the memory keys over reveals pi, square root, squared, and decimal conversion keys.<br /><br />It boasts a backspace key, but I don't remember whether the stock hs one too.<br /><br />One final great feature this has, &amp; the reason it will now be my main calculator, is it stores your previous calculations in memory. I was using office calculator for its tape function, but this is a much better format for me (the &quot;key pad&quot; part of office calc should be fine on a tablet, but is quite small on my phone.)<br /><br />When I make a deposit I add all my checks, then subtract them each from the end total to be sure I didn't miss one or have a bad entry. With office calc I would just add everything then visually verify each line againstthe corresponding check- a big time saver. I can do the same thing here but with the more convenient interface of a pocket calculator.<br />The last calculation is shown faintly below the display. Touching that takes you to the history page showing your other calculations. There's also a clear button there. I don't remember there being an option to delete or save a single entry, but I didn't spend any time exploring it beyond navigating there &amp; clearing it all.<br /><br />This last point brings me to address a few of the 1-star reviews which say this doesn't provide the correct order of functions, resulting in a wrong answer. They say that division or multiplication should happen before addition, regardless of three being no parenthesis option. Ex, they feel that 2+6*3 should equal 20, not 24, as it would if written 2+(6*3). I disagree. Given that this is a pocket calculator with some nice extras, I think it would be confusing to the majority of users to calculate as if there were parentheses, even if strictly speaking that would be more correct. The reason we still use parentheses, even in college, is for clarity. Without them, and in this application, I prefer the way it calculates.
B00005N6KG|2.0|I love the structure of this headphone very much, especially for my running time. It is light, would not hurt the ear, due to its small size, and has a good sound. But, the wire get lose and you lose the sound, either on one side or both, and get a lot of static that is extremely annoying. I bought this twice, once at about $5.50, and the second time $9.50 (March 2013, only 6 months ago), and thought it was still worth it, since the price was relatively low. But at the new price of about $49, I don't think so. Would not recommend it.
B00F87ZUYG|5.0|Although at the time of this purchase, it has only been the first episode. Greatly anticipating this season! Love amazon because I work Sundays and I don't have cable but I can still watch my shoes without commercials.
B00ADQCBEY|5.0|Found it by accident and really enjoyed the drama-it was fast pacced and held my interest.I will be sure to watch other episodes
B004J4WKUQ|5.0|Was a very enjoyable book, if you were breathing in the 80s and were any kind of self respecting nerd you'll love this book
B007Q476KU|4.0|As far as the quality the movie was amazing. The only problem I had was I couldn't access the movie a second time.

1577311523|5.0|I READ THIS BOOK A FEW YEARS AGO.  I HAVE REREAD IT SEVERAL TIMES NEVER FAILING TO GIVE ME NEW INSITE. MY EGO STILL TAKES OVER BUT SOMETIMES I STOP AND A NEW MESSAGE COME TRU. JUST THIS MORNING I WAS LOOKING AT THE WAY MY 73 YEAR OLD HUSBAND (WITH A VISION PROBLEM) HAD HUNG THE TOWELS IN THE BATHROOM. ALL THE LABELS WERE ON THE OUTSIDE. MY FIRST THOUGHT WAS I HAVE TO DO EVERYTHING AROUND HERE. OR I NEED TO TELL HIM TO DO IT RIGHT. THEN ANOTHER THOUGHT ( I SHOULD JUST CUT  OFF THE LABELS) (NO EGO THERE) I THINK THE STORY OF THE FOG AND THE FLASHLIGHT WAS GREAT.  I TRY TO BE  STILL AND WALK IN THE LIGHT.  AT LEAST ONCE IN A WHILE<br />BLESSINGS<br />JOANNA
B00BRUPICM|5.0|Great book - enjoyed it very much! Love the twists and turns and especially that the detective wasn't your usual type for a change.
B001NLKZUA|4.0|Sometimes I wish authors would pay attention to what they wrote three pages ago. All her books make you want to know how it ends. She also has moments that catch your heart.  But there things that annoy me about this book that are errors or make no sense.
B004X6PRO6|3.0|This book won the Pulitzer Prize. Clearly it's well written and educational. But, it is so depressing. It sucks your will to live. I read most of it for my book group, and I am glad that I did read some of it because I learned about North Korea, or what I think is or was true about North Korea. I hope that the North Korean government and culture are not as bad as this book depicts. It does a great job of showing how our US culture can look bizarrely funny in the eyes of another. I recommend reading the part about the trip to Texas.<br /><br />However, I had to plan something fun to do after I finished reading a few chapters, because it is depicts a harsh, hopeless life.
B00FAPF5U0|4.0|I have been waiting for this on kindle. my wife has on her droid tablet but I could not get on.  Possibly the best game on a tablet.

B002MQYOFW|5.0|The Hunger Games is an interesting book for people who like suspense and mystery like I do. The twists in the story like Katniss falling for Peeta sorry if I ruined that part for you people who haven't read the story yet oops:) but anyway Katniss realises that she has feelings for him. The book an amazing story the author should be proud of herself the other books are great to cant wait to see the third movie thanks for the amazing story Suzanne Collins :D
B009VIZDLI|5.0|Laugh from page 2!!!!! Such a well written book , only through 54% of it but amazon wants me to share this with you now ..... I think they should ask my opinion AFTER I finish the book and I know they know when I finish ....

B003V4AK8E|2.0|I bought this controller because my Dualshock 3's were too small for my hands. The controller worked very good for a week, then the left analog stick began sticking in the right position. The sticking of the analog stick sorted itself out, until it later began sticking in the left position. By this point I had it in my mind to correct it as I played so it didn't bother me, but then the X button began sticking. The X button would slowly come back up after I pressed it down and, when it was almost up, would pop the rest of the way up with a loud clicking noise. After about a month of using it, I decided it had outlived its usefulness and I put it away as a backup. It was very disappointing, as it is whenever an item you purchase doesn't work correctly, but that's just how things go I suppose. Don't buy it unless it's for a cheap backup that will only see the light of day when you have company.
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|so happy i could finally get this on my kindle fire it so much fun and falling back in love with my kindle fire Thank You AMAZON!!!!
B004DLPXAO|5.0|Not that painful to install, and every book I've bought through it has worked flawlessly. Like the interface.  Not perfect but very good.<br /><br />The other ebook readers I've tried have been disappointments, and the Kindle app was like a salve for my wounds.
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|I was so excited to finally get this on my kindle. It was a long time coming. Love it. Can't stop playing .

031623480X|3.0|I hate to give a mediocre review to a book that is presenting critically important, truthful information to the public (drastically decrease carbs, dramatically improve your health).  However, this one deserves it because it is just piggybacking on the Paleo movement and the book \\"Wheat Belly,\\" and not even doing it well.  Essentially, because numerous other authors have already explained the science behind how a high-carb diet vs. a low-carb diet affect general health and hormones (\\"It Starts With Food\\" does this particularly well), this book could (and should) have been edited down to one two-page article describing how a low-carb diet helps THE BRAIN.  Instead, the author presents the most cursory summaries of the science, and adds onto the end \\"and this also affects your brain health.\\"  Not that helpful.<br /><br />The editing also left much to be desired.  I found the author's thoughts incomplete, the transitions nonexistent, and the book poorly organized (for example, in the \\"sleep\\" chapter, he discusses how people become leptin resistant by eating too many carbs, affecting the hunger hormone gherelin, making people fat, and hardly even attempts to link this to sleep).  I was glad to learn about the examples of his specific patients who benefitted from low carb diets, but there are only 4 or 5 of them in the entire book!  I was also happy to read about the scientific studies in reference to Alzheimer's disease, memory and cognitive decline.  These few bits of information seem to be the only original material in the book.  The author basically recommends a 30-day Paleo immersion, which numerous others have recommended before (Mark Sisson, Robb Wolf, Whole9, Practical Paleo, etc.).  I didn't read all the notes, but the only credit I saw given to any Paleo resource was for a \\"cereal\\" recipe he adapted from Loren Cordain.<br /><br />I'm giving the book three stars because all of his main points are correct and very important, but because 95% of the content is notoriginal, I feel like the book may really deserve only two.
B00A6CCF0K|5.0|Good story, well told, loaded with suspense, and a very weird and somehow believable plot.  The usual good character development keeps me interested and coming back for more. Recommended for bedtime reading; could very well become more TV material.
B00BAXFCPO|4.0|I was expecting a drill sergeant type of manifesto here but I was pleasantly surprised at how  gently but forcefully he presented his findings. I read another book called &#34;Wheat Belly&#34; last year which changed my life and my way of thinking about food.This book presents some compelling evidence for following the gluten free path so many doctors are now preaching about and how destructive gluten is for everyone. For me his specialty of neurology and the emphasis on the brain and how it becomes so impaired with the effects of gluten is hard to dispute. Yes some of the book was hard to navigate for a lay person, but I applaud his effort and hope people listen to his message. I know he hopes to persuade against the evils of gluten, and I hope he finds a wide audience. He is absolutely right. Maybe our ability to diminish dementia can be accomplished. Who knows?
B00BAXFAOW|5.0|As Gladwell's books go - brilliantly written. Light, interesting, sweeps the reader along. Not a scientific publication, nor a dispassionate or objective manuscript. Just fun to read, exhilarating history, anecdotes and argumentation. Great food for conversation and thought.
B0063IH60K|1.0|This silly review sheet won't allow someone on an android to put things at the end of a sentence.  I like the new end graphics. It's a boring game, for when you need to think, and well done for the category.
B003G4W49C|5.0|I am not a science fiction fan, but this was a great story! I would recommend this book. Can't wait for the movie.
B0063IH60K|5.0|Great game but highly addictive it will help you to pass the time while waiting for your wife who is shopping, or just having fun,this game is my personal favorite.
B00DW1WR14|5.0|I was disappointed with Backspacer, PJ's last record. I felt like there were good songs on the record but it was incredibly uneven. Also sounded like Eddie basically took over the song writing and was punk rock song, punk rock song, acoustic ballad.  The great multi layered PJ songs from No Code, Yield, Riot Act, and even Avocado were missing. So I had tempered expectations when I first listened to Lightning Bolt and I must say, my hesitation was unwarranted. This is a great Pearl Jam record for Pearl Jam fans. If you are expecting Ten 2.0 look elsewhere but if you were a fan of Pearl Jam in the No Code, Yield, Binaural, Riot Act era, you are going to love it.  Sirens is an absolute classic rock song. Mike McCready wrote the music and it is multilayered with plenty of guitars. Great lyrics and vocals from Eddie as well. Yellow Moon, which is a Jeff Ament song is another highlight of the record, just classic PJ. Overall the only song that hasn't really grabbed me yet, is Future Days, which is the last song on the album. I'm just really happy that Pearl Jam has put out another classic because I was starting to wonder if they had this record in them after the disappointment of Backspacer.  One note, as a hardcore PJ fan I was upset that Of the Earth, which has been played live a few times, wasn't included on this record.  Hopefully we will get a Lost Dogs part 2 album one of these days. But man, does it feel good to have another classic Pearl Jam record out again.
B008M7BQHE|5.0|Look I am a Sci fi buff and this was one of the most enjoyable shows it had family value, intrigue, science, whit, good interpersonal relationships, with out a drought I wish it had gone on for a while longer great work to the producers and cast and crew of this one.
0061950726|5.0|This is not a piece of history with which I was familiar. Since reading it I have had  discussions with people older than I am and have learned of their knowledge of the orphan train. I  have had conversations with  people who knew someone who was one of the orphans.<br />I do not know if this piece of US History was intentionally  hidden but am glad I was finally exposed to it.  The book is interesting and informative but  also sad.  It is definitely one to be read in a day as one cannot put it down
B007REV4YI|5.0|I'm a fan of the franchise...so if you too are a &#34;fan...&#34; You should be happy with this one...lots of action and plot intrigue...the &#34;sexual exploitation of women&#34; however...is somewhat subdued...surprisingly! Still...at the end of the day...Bond does,&#34; love...and leave em&#34;...which is what 007 is all about....so fasten your seat belts...the opening sequence is a great setup to the rest of the movie. I hope you will enjoy this one...you should not be disappointed! Bond will continue to fight the bad guys for years to come! Great addition to the 007 line of entertainment! Even Roger Moore says Daniel Craig is...&#34; The best Bond ever...&#34; Due to all the athletic moves required of the actor in the &#34;new century&#34; of  HD-CGI action. Enjoy! (But judge for yourself if Craig really is the &#34;best Bond..&#34;) I say no...only because Sean Connery set the tone...of a very well made movie franchise!
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|finally amazon came to their senses and are on the ball...  have had to play the hacked version for months. well worth the wait
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|Thanks Amazon for having this on Appstore! Really love this game and am so excited to have this on kindle directly downloaded!
B0040I09RM|3.0|Just good enough to keep you interested but that's all. It's a soap opera about good bad guys and bad good guys on Harleys. I keep expecting Susan Lucci to show up.
1575666286|4.0|I have not fully digested the contents of this book.  It sounds like a good plan to have in place to help the Chemo or what ever treatment your doctor prescribes.  No one thinks much about the subject until it hits home.  This book has a lot of valuable information.
B001TXWJ4M|5.0|The acting, directing, and writing are superb! Breaking Bad is must-see TV and you'll be discussing it long after the credits have rolled.
1609611543|5.0|This book presents a lot of factual information and provides the whys and wherefore of the subject.  Very informative. Won't hurt anyone to go without wheat for a short time to see the effects it has on the body, then judge for yourself.
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|I have waited so long for this app to get to the Amazon app store and its finally here. This app is a must get app and it is very addictive.
B000IEXVCC|5.0|Typically dark film by the master of his genre. A more cohesive story than some of his other films. Great locations.
B0029LCJJS|5.0|I have always loved historical dramas and this fills the bill. Wonderful acting, costumes and scenery. The story line was written by history and Henry the VIII was one of it's most interesting characters. Can't wait to see the rest of the series.
B008EL25LE|3.0|I like the game. I'd like it better if it were not timed.<br />For me, I want to relax with a game.<br />It would have been nice if we were given a choice in the matter.<br />Other than that, 'good game'...
1932907009|4.0|Great for screenwriters and fiction writers alike. Great book on all aspects that go into telling a story. Highly recommend this book.
B007EC27QM|5.0|Pretty nice calculator.<br />One negative feedback - it teaches people bad math. The examples say : to calculate the tip on 21 dollars,  type  21+18%.<br />Very easy to use.
B008EEZ64Y|4.0|I liked it. I want to read the next book. Seems like the hunger games took a little from this book.

B00FAPF5U0|4.0|Finally! I waited so long for kindle to release candy crush. It is very addictive. I only gave it 4 stars because I don't like waiting on lives or having to wait on lives.

B001HM1PFO|5.0|I try to watch this every year around Halloween.  I finally just ordered the movie.  According to the description, it includes all the captions for audience participation.  If you haven't gone to a theater to see it with the audience props, it's hilarious!!!!  Especially a midnight showing!

B006DJ2JSI|5.0|its a dictionary like the way they say the word.<br />the dictionary is easy to navigate with the pop ups
B00D48BSBA|5.0|Foresyth has again done it! Very exiting reading and through thorough research you'll find many truths about the US/Pakistan/Afganistan relationship. As we all know, it doesn't smell of roses. It also shows how terrorists are 'born'. Simply every time a Nato bomb blows away innocent people, their families all swear to kill the great Satan.<br />The book realistically describes how these hate preachers reach out to many desillusioned people. It is a book that lingers with you for days after you have read the last page.
B000FCK8ZK|4.0|The book was good, not totally my type of a good read, but everyone enjoys different books. I will not say Jeff Lindsay is a bad writer, just not my type of an interesting book.
B004HX0P2Y|5.0|I had this movie on a long list of DVD to buy. I bought it on one of those days when I just needed to laugh. It delivered...funny dark almost shameful humor.  I love the entire cast.

B00F87A7HG|4.0|This album feels like Kings of Leon. There is the familiar sound of southern rock and pop infused grind, the gospel jam, the aching vocals. I love it.
B00881VLCE|5.0|Can't put it down. This is the best puzzle app I have used. I have not experienced any problems so far.
B003JTHWPA|5.0|I loved the story. I had to read for a class I'm currently enrolled in and I think it's quite interesting to the end. I would recommend to others for a great read.
B00CTNUMPO|5.0|Old Disney animation movies are my favorites.  Glad they are coming out on Blu Ray.  Love the &#34;moral to the story&#34; they have and the co-starring characters who carry the movie.
B009DCOU9S|2.0|I did not find this game entertaining at all. I got bored of it after a few minutes. But that is just my opinion, others may find it interesting, I just didn't. For a phone app it had good graphics though.

B000JCSBU0|5.0|Such a powerful film. Recommend to everyone. Unique and entertaining. The climax really leaves you speechless. I sat there and cried for like 10 minutes.
B000I3UMKM|5.0|For a woman in her twenties, it is refreshing to watch a film that can be funny, romantic, and feel-good without the \\"sex sells\\" mentality that we often find in the latest film making.
B005ZOBNOI|5.0|After just witnessing my grandfather loose his battle with cancer, I found myself crying a lot and making many connections with the characters in the book.
B008P1EWIM|2.0|After reading the steller reviews I ordered.  Now I have 8 weather apps (4 for hurricane tracking) this has the least info.  Doesn't even have radar.  Money wasted
B00CS74W0C|5.0|From the start I was so caught up that I just couldn't put it down. I devoured the series, and can't wait for the next installment!
B007IXWKUK|5.0|Great story and steamy interaction! It was a page turner and it only took me 2 days to read it. I highly recommend the trilogy.
B00DW1WR14|5.0|Wow! It would be ignorant of me to pretend to have the words to describe such an obviously heartfelt release. There is only one way for me to so it justice. Buy it. Wear it out. Thank you boys. Make more.
B00DQZQSNO|4.0|I like this cover a lot, but like another reviewer said I wish it worked better for reading. The fabric is nice, the color (purple) is attractive, the Kindle snaps in securely, and it feels well-made in general. It works very well for propping up the Kindle for viewing video, and I like that there are three different positions to help find the best angle for viewing. However, because of the way the back is only halfway attached and because there's no way to secure the cover when it's folded back it's somewhat awkward to hold in one hand for reading. If I bring the elastic band around, it covers the edge of the screen, and even if I push it to the side it's distracting. In future versions of this, some kind of snap or magnet to hold the cover in the folded-back position would be really helpful.
1476734941|5.0|This concept of the Fast Diet 5/2 really works for me.  It is so wonderful until my husband has started the 5/2 on a weekly basis and likes the result.  It is helping me get those last  7 lbs off,  It is refreshing to only have two days of the week restricted in diet and portion control is much easier the other 5.  I have  used the Flat Belly diet for four years, but needed something different for my body to get rid  of those final 7 lbs.  The 5/2 will become a lifestyle change for me.  I enjoy the feeling fasting gives me. . .more energy.
B002SR2PKG|5.0|Though reading this book requires quite an investment due to its length, it is well worth it to read a great story with great characters in a great setting. In other words, typical Stephen King. Just a word to the wise. Don't read this story alone in the dark...
B00EI6E17A|5.0|She did it again! Great beat! Lyrically poetic! She is a freaking genius! Perfect for working out our dancing around your house when no one is watching :-)
0307949508|2.0|This book has so many characters that pop up with no explanation or previous occurrence.  Other reviewer wrote that Lizbeth Salander matures in the book but I didn't see that at all.<br /><br />My main complaint is ...too many characters and there's no literary reason for them.  I am struggling to get through this book.  I know that Lizbeth Salander is considered a heroine and a fully developed character, but I don't see it.
B00E193TM2|5.0|FFDP just keeps getting better and better with each release. The band really rocks it on this one and having Rob Halford collaborate on a track is the icing on the cake. A must buy if you love hard rock/metal.
B00A6CCF0K|5.0|Great Sequel to &#34;The Shining&#34;. My favorite author didn't let me down on this story. If you have only seen the movie of The Shining then you probably won't understand this book.  The story picks up with Danny Torrence an adult now facing ghosts and demons from his past, literally, and how he ends up helping a young girl who's power of the shine is even stronger. Lots is suspense and just an all around great read.
B003F44QRQ|3.0|I remember really liking this flick when I saw it as a teenager. Watching it again, I can see why. It was a vapid, movie length music video. The scariest element of the movie was Corey Haim's wardrobe for the first half of the movie.<br /><br />The vampire makeup was decent and it's fun to see such a young Keifer ham it up, but beyond that there's not a lot to recommend here.
B00BTYP6QE|5.0|Fabulous app. I don't really play games but I found this fun and challenging to play. Good for all ages. I recommend this for just about anyone. Keep the levels coming guys.
B00BEIYMAG|4.0|This is out at Wal- Mart bbought it 2 days ago. Just sitting there it is a good movie. Dont know why theey put it on the shelves but this isnt the first time they have done this.

B0060D123K|5.0|Clever, funny, a great family tradition. This is a must for the holidays. The muppets are a part of our family.
B007PKSN6Q|5.0|this movie had fantastic songs in it. bought soundtrack for a gift. my nephew actually listens to music I grew up with. I couldn't miss the chance to share my childhood with him.
B00EUEWRUI|5.0|Yes, he is. And he smiles a lot.... even at Gillan. Ritchie sure looks to be enjoying himself and indulges quite a bit as the set moves along.<br /><br />The film isn't as good as one would wish, but any Deep Purple is better than no Deep Purple, especially from this era.<br /><br />Of course, I watched it on a 47\\" flat screen. Yes, it's in 4:3, but I just put the setting at Zoom and it still looks good enough for me. If you're expecting near-HD quality, you'll be disappointed.<br /><br />I have yet to listen to the 2-disc set that comes with this.<br /><br />All in all, worth the purchase.
B003ODIZL6|5.0|I chose this rating because of the ability to search the words in the dictionary and its convenience and thoroughness.
B009V3KKXY|5.0|JD is a masterful and creative knot genius. I haven't been creative enough to expand upon the basics yet, I have purchased both of his volumes hard copy as well. If you haven't checked out his youtube videos at Tying it All Together you need to go check them out.
0205313426|5.0|A classic that is updated enough to keep it current without ruining the original call to clear, concise writing. I use this in my senior high writing class in hopes that my students will find it a lifelong companion as I have.
B006LA6IW2|5.0|I am almost at a loss for words. I loved everything about this book, the vivid images, the emotion that it brings to bear. It's a shame that he is no longer with us, I loved his writing style because any Service Member or Veteran can relate to the brief concise way he was able to get information across while still conveying are great deal of information  If you aren't a Veteran then sit back and become educated about the life of a hero. Keep your hippie opinions to yourself if you have negative thoughts about what this patriot accomplished as a warfighter. We fought for your freedom of speech but it doesn't mean we have to accept ignorance. RIP Brother, I will always keep my copy of your book as a personal favorite from our war on terror.
B00ABKGG0C|5.0|I love this story.  It grabbed me by the neck, shook me around, and wouldn't let me go.  I simply didn't want to stop reading.  I thoroughly enjoyed the character development as the story unfolded, as a young boy became a man.  I strongly recommend this book. Personally, I cannot wait for the next chapter to become available.
B00DUGCLY4|5.0|this is a great game to play . I like it because its a challenge.  And I like any thing that is a challenge. to me
B007EC27QM|5.0|This is an excellent calculator app.  If you are looking for a scientific calculator, look elsewhere because this is just a simple calc app.  Best FAOTD ever!
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|I love this game so much. I checked to see at least once a week if it came out. Although it took two times to download, it was worth it. I played it on a iPod and wanted it to come on the kindle fire. This is by far the best game ever. P.S this is my first review. That is how good this game is.
B0094BB4TW|5.0|Allows me to check my facebook status and update my status etc. So far, no glitches or problems. Sends me a push when I have a new notice. I like it.
B00EEDJM2Q|5.0|When I first played this game, I thought &quot;waaay too easy&quot; and was fitting to stop playing it when I felt this sudden yearn to play it some more. You can say that I'm addicted to scissors and buttons puzzles. There are 5x5 boards to 7x7 each wringing about a hundred puzzles so, good luck beating it before you turn another age.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|This game is great for my 3 year old my three year old knows a lot. This game is great great great.
B003DDKAT2|5.0|As an aficionado of vampire novels/movies this one has become my favorite. Telling the story from the vampire's eyes we see how he feels, from having been made to the loneliness of living and feeding on humans (and animals) for hundreds of years. The more believable, more credible a piece of fiction is, the more I like it. This is the best by far. Over the years I've seen this movie four times. It has retained it's grip on me.
B009ZXT4BY|4.0|It's not a good time to get the best way why not get it but the demo is short ok
B00E6895M6|5.0|While this not necessarily my go-to genre of music, I can't put the CD down, I have it playing every time I'm in the car. Its so good!
0062225790|5.0|When I hear the name Richard Dawkins I am more apt to think of \\"The God Delusion\\" rather than his benchmark \\"The Selfish Gene\\", not because the one is better than the other but because the former seems closer to my own heart (and yet what could be closer than a gene?). I grabbed this book to see how Dawkins became what he is today and I learned plenty. Memoir - really autobiography - of the first half of his life, you'll see a life that isn't so unusual as what he's made of each opportunity. Watch how a critical thinker unfolds his wings and takes flight. The wonder in this world is clearly illuminated by science, not superstition.
B006OITIQE|3.0|Hope they can compose their own songs of meanings - lyrics are not very impressive; poor words put together without great senses; and music melodies are not unique - lots of parts are familiar, seemingly copied from some where else and rendered. Of course they are new to music industry - they now need to have their own thoughts, originality, and then sing. I accompanied my daughter to their live show - their performing styles were too self-entertaining and spoiled by those teenage-like young ladies; the audience ranges are narrowed to teens and girls. It seems that American girls are somehow charmed by Brits culturally? One or two of them have good attitudes during the shows and some other band members are not very attentive to the ardent audiences... I hope I will be wrong with these comments - my daughter and her friends are so enthusiastic to this band - Hope they revolutionize them, and keep their momentum of popularity to the future...
B000FCKC4C|5.0|A simply told story but a weighty message. Will be reading again to gain insights on life and how to apply.
B003JTHXOK|5.0|This is my first Nicholas Sparks book, and I know I'll be coming back for more of his stories. He writes with the sensitivity of a woman, such that I was at first convinced that he was a woman with a pen name. But I went to his author page and....there he was, picture and all. Amazing.  He is a gifted writer. I &#34;book bonded&#34; with this story immediately, which seldom happens with me.<br /><br />This book is reminiscent of the movie &#34;Sleeping With the Enemy&#34; (Julia Roberts).  And while much of the book was somewhat predictable, it was well written and enjoyable, and then our heads are twisted around at the end with a high-octane ending with a surprise outside of what we might expect.<br /><br />The book is about a young married woman who is abused and isolated by her alchoholic (and possibly sociopathic) husband. She escapes, changing her identity and finding a new town far away from his  wrath. In this small southern town she builds a new life and meets her new friend Jo, a lively woman next door, and Alex, a kindly store owner and widower with two young children. Just when I thought the book was predictable in its plot, along comes a whopper of an ending, powerfully explosive and emotional, with an unexpected twist. While most of the book was a strong 4 stars, the end rose it to 5 stars.<br /><br />It was difficult to stop listening to the audiobook and I enjoyed my commutes. The woman narrator is outstanding and is gifted with creating voices and bringing the storytelling to life. She made the listening experience pleasant and easy to sink into the story. Great voice.<br /><br />So 5 stars for my first Nicholas Sparks book, and I'm looking forward to more of his writings.
B00FAPF5U0|2.0|Total change of opinion - crashes constantly (especially when you are about to finish the level) - bought a couple of boosters - never got them but crashed the game again.  I used to love it but I'm just over it.
B0066W1AZK|5.0|this game is so awesome and a great chess app. you should totally get this game.The first time I played this game it was so much fun
014050639X|5.0|This book has a special place in my heart... it was the first book I ever \\"read\\" (though really, I had it memorized, and just fooled (or if they weren't fooled, they sure pretended to be!) family and friends by \\"reading\\" the book by myself! LOL!  And now, I read this book to my daughter almost every night.  The poetic rhyme of the book makes it easy for kids to learn and remember. The pictures make the book interesting and fun for young minds.  Older toddlers/school-aged children will love to try to find the characters hidden in each picture!  The large words help parents and new readers move their fingers along under the words as the children try to learn the new words.  Familiar characters help make reading less intimidating.  I can't say enough about how truly wonderful this book is, and how much this book meant to me as a child, and how much it means to me now as a parent.
B008YKGQR4|5.0|It is a good app. Works a lot better then I imagined on my Kindle Fire HD. I sometimes forget that I am using a tablet.
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|If this was a $1.00 I would still get it. I love the update. Get it now because they might raise the price.
B00884GR0W|3.0|Well, it really wasn't what I expected. I mean, it's cool and all, but I find that it's hard to complete the quests. Oh, and one more thing. If you want to talk to someone, make sure you don't have a weapon or something in your hand or else it won't work and they'll just attack you or something.
B009LHWEKW|5.0|The best show ever. I like it. I can not wait until series 9 will be out there. Definitely recommend.
B007EC27QM|5.0|This is a great calculator. I like the fact that's it's on hand with I'm on my kindle and I don't have to try to find a calculator when I need one.
B004X2M3N8|5.0|This season and the one before it feature some of the best writing of any Doctor Who seasons to date.
B002VH7P4O|5.0|The Beatles Flac's sound great on my Onkyo amp.& Polk audio speakers in the living room. I converted the Flac's to Wav. format & put them in my I-Pod. Lastly I converted the Wav.'s to Apple's AIFF format and they sound great on my I-Pod as well. I'm very happy I made this  purchase.
B003WUYOQ6|5.0|Very good read to complement other books such as the art and science of low carbohydrate living and performance, paleo solutions, and the primal blueprint. Although I'm not completely paleo, having been someone who weighed 315lbs, now at 161lbs using lchf diets, I found the info in here very good to further solidify my reasoning behind living the way I do.
B001P4ESGC|5.0|This series was well written and the actors fit their parts perfectly.  I enjoyed the fact that it carried over each week and there wasn't always a different story.  Well done.
B000JMKQX0|5.0|One of the best books air have ever read! Keeps you on the edge of your seat, and doesn't skip any details! Wish there were more books like this.
B005LAJ1O0|5.0|I already fell in love with this series after the first time i saw it. Unfortunantly, Walmart expected me to pat at least $50 for the season. I'm so happy i found it for this amount.
B0012QRPU4|5.0|This is single most thought provoking series I've seen since Lost. The character chemistry is explosive! I could have done without the decomposed human clean up. I am mesmerized and will keep watching.
B0063IH60K|5.0|It works easily and is fun to play with different options on how to play or deal.  Enjoy the game
B0015DRPJU|5.0|So Shadow Kiss is the book that takes the Vampire Academy series to the next level. I always tell people thinking about reading this series to at least give it until Shadow Kiss to decide how you feel about the series. Vampire Academy and Frostbite are both good and Frostbite progresses in depth and conflict, but Shadow Kiss blows both of these novels away.<br /><br />Richelle Mead starts Shadow Kiss off with this opening scene that has you going \\"wow that's progressing fast,\\" and \\"is this really happening,\\" to \\"oh my goodness how embarrassing,\\" and \\"poor Rose.\\" And then you just end up laughing out loud--or I do anyway. This scene is the perfect way to set the tone for this book. Rose is so in her face, forcefully shown everything she wants, but can't have and I feel so bad for her. Still reeling from Mason's death, Rose is in an emotionally vulnerable place when we start Shadow Kiss.<br /><br />A large portion of Vampire Academy is centered around Rose's training to become a guardian--Lissa's guardian. So I loved the concept of the field tests that Richelle Mead adds in as part of the novices' school curriculum. It's brilliant. But the setup and execution for the field tests doesn't really go as Rose expects it to. Rose, of course, has no issues in letting the authorities know how she feels about it all, but the guardians have good reason for making the decisions they have and Rose eventually comes to see the logic behind all of that. I just love how typical Rose handles all of this with her snarky, smart mouth.<br /><br />Richelle Mead cuts this book with plenty of sarcasm and snarky, witty comments. Rose and Adrian continue to banter back and forth as well as Rose and Christian. I just love it. And considering how heavy the ending of this book is, the beginning needed all the lightness it could get from the jokes and laugh out loud moments.<br /><br />Despite the letdown of hopes from the opening scene, Rose and Dimitri do continue to grow closer throughout Shadow Kiss. Dimitri's ability to predict Rose's behavior with the field experience setup, Dimitri volunteering to help with Rose's community service just to spend time with her, his protectiveness over her with Victor and the trial, telling her to wear her hair up for the trial, I could go on and on. Either way, the moments between them continue to build faith in each other, trust, tension, affection, all of the things that are necessary to make up truly epic love. Can I just say \\"fight scene\\" and \\"the cabin?\\" Those who have read this series will know what I mean. EEEE! *giggles like a little girl*<br /><br />The other characters continue to grow as well. Lissa is showing herself to be more confident and comfortable in her abilities, herself, and in her opinions. Christian continues to press for what he believes in--though he does have a stint of jealousy throughout the book. Adrian grows more in his abilities, but his presence and the importance of having him around grows as well. Eddie is an almost completely changed character from where he was in the first two books. Being extremely affected by the death of Mason, his best friend, in Frostbite, Eddie can't help but take life and his job as a guardian seriously since he's seen first hand the hand of the enemy.<br /><br />As I've said in both of my reviews of Vampire Academy and Frostbite, Richelle Mead continues to astound me with her level of foreshadowing. I've said before that good foreshadowing is a fine line between spelling out what's coming and hinting without the reader even knowing that's what the author is doing. Richelle Mead is a master. I wish I could tell you all of the places that I've found it, but most of them are spoilers for what's to come--obviously. But the fact that Richelle Mead is so good at placing these clues and phrases throughout this series makes Vampire Academy worthy to be read and re-read over and over again in my opinion. I love being able to see all of the pieces that she revealed throughout the series. Mind-blowing. Shoot, there's even one comment in Shadow Kiss that I don't know that Richelle Mead intended, but foreshadows some plot aspects in the Bloodlines series.<br /><br />We find out more about what it means to be \\"shadow kissed\\" which makes sense considering that's essentially the title of this one. This would have been spoilerish for Frostbite, but once you know what's going on between the bond and Lissa and Rose with the shadow kissed business, some of Rose's behavior in Frostbite makes even more sense.<br /><br />While all of Shadow Kiss is pretty stinking good, the best of the book is found in the last section really. From the \\"cabin scene\\" on things progress very quickly. I don't want to give away anything that happens, but be warned that there is quite the cliffhanger. Lucky for those of you who might not have read the Vampire Academy series yet, all of the books in this series are already published and you should be able to move straight from Shadow Kiss into Blood Promise. I will advise that you will probably want to do just that with the cliffhanger ending of Shadow Kiss. Some of us had to wait like 9 months or so after finishing Shadow Kiss before we could read Blood Promise. I still get chills reading the entire last portion of this book. I wish I could do some quotes from this section or even just talk about it, but I just can't spoil anything for you. It's too major.<br /><br />There's so much more that I want to say, but I've got to cut it off somewhere. Shadow Kiss got 5 stars from me after my very first read. I'm willing to give it the same now. It's still epic. And as I said before, Shadow Kiss completely takes the Vampire Academy series to the next level. I do consider Shadow Kiss and the Vampire Academy series to be a must read. Have you read Shadow Kiss? What did you think?

B00992CF6W|5.0|This is one of my favorite games because you can build your own world the way you want to and you can save your world.
B0089EHWQE|5.0|Reading the description of this book, I never would have read it, but my book club chose it so. . .  And I'm so glad they did!  Not predictable, nor a tear-jerker.  I was rooting for several characters along the way.  Absolutely, give this novel a chance even if the description of the story sounds terribly depressing.  It certainly is, in places, but there is so much more to this novel than a quadriplegic coping.  It's about how everyone copes, at some point.  And how one decides to make a change.
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|this game is so much fun! I play every day. the graphics are awesome. but it sometimes freezes and throws me out.
031623480X|5.0|This is an amazing breakthrough book. I respect the credentials of the writer as both an integrative healer and neurologist. This could correct the health problems of our country, if people only listened.
B00CWY76CC|5.0|I was not expecting this game to be so engaging and interactive! The first nine levels are fairly easy, though my Kindle did not always cooperate. That was especially a problem on level 10, which took me three days, but that was not the app's fault and ultimately I was able to put the paper where it needed to go. Can't wait for more levels!
B007J4T2G8|5.0|This is one of the books I read over and over. The characters are well developed and the book has an amazing captivating story line. Definitely a repeat book.

B00E9P959O|3.0|When I got the remixed version I ripped both that and the original to FLAC and listened to each song alternately, about 15 seconds at a time. The remix is certainly cleaner, although some individual parts still have distortion, like they were just recorded too hot to begin with.<br /><br />Evidently, cleaning up the distortion comes at a cost. The remix has definitely lost some of the \\"oomph\\" of the original. That's instantly noticeable from the opening double-bass roll; in the remix it's lost all heaviness, almost like it was played entirely on floor toms, and the weaker sound continues througout. All the instruments sound thinner and less warm, particularly the bass guitar - it's more clicky and brighter guitar-sounding. This thinness results with the instruments meshing less and having more separation from one another - too much separation sometimes, almost leaving an emptiness of sound. A comparison would be the almost bass-free Metallica's \\"...And Justice For All\\" (maybe you could compare the clutter of the first Vapor Trails to \\"Death Magnetic\\"!).<br /><br />On the plus side, there are parts I never heard before, either because they were overshadowed by the louder parts, or they were added to this version.<br /><br />In case you're curious, don't expect a \\"remixed\\" booklet to come with this. Aside from the cover artwork, the booklet is identical to the original with the exception of a few names that were involved with the remix listed in the liner notes.<br /><br />Enough has been written about the \\"loudness wars\\" that I don't need to go into those details. I'm not an engineer, but I have to assume there's only so much that can be done, even with today's technology. Those experienced with audio recording have claimed that the masters themselves weren't recorded properly to begin with. If that's the case, then this scratch and dent version is the best we can hope for, BUT WE SHOULD ASK OURSELVES, would this still be a disappointment if we had never heard the original and had nothing to compare the remix to? I'm just going to try and enjoy it as it is.iginal and had nothing to compare the remix to? I'm just going to try and enjoy it as it is.
B001NEK2GE|5.0|Just got mine but was using my sons G13 for a week, that is what prompted me to get one for myself. The problem is it has more options/features than I have figured out how to use; that problem is with the operator of the device and NOT the device &#60;Big Grin&#62;. If you do on line games I would suggest you take a serious look at this device.

B004J4WNL2|3.0|It's a tough read. Doesn't seem to flow well. However, there is some good material in this book. I think it would be better read in hard copy. I am reading it on my kindle.

B00FAPF5U0|4.0|Fun game, but if you run out of &quot;lives&quot; you just have to wait for more.  A terrific little time waster, but I hate having to wait to try a level again and again.  I would not have paid for this app, but since it is free, it is fun to have.
B0036S4B6M|4.0|I had watched the first season of Orange is the new Black, before I knew it was a book. The book is good, and there are some similarities to the show, but I will say the show is much more entertaining. The book is more of a spiritual journey. Still a great read
B003NX76BM|5.0|One of my favorite books I've read yet! The love story, while not over powering of the book, was not sappy or sweet, but real! The mystery kept you on your toes, wondering what happens next and the ending, an exciting, satisfactory twist!
B004FGMDOQ|4.0|This book is extremely slow to get interesting and I almost gave up on it several times. However, about a fourth of the way through it becomes extremely fascinating and I couldn't put it down. I seriously fell in love with the characters and can't wait till the next book comes out.<br /><br />I do a detailed summary of the book, along with the graphic novel and the new book Hollow City in my recent vlog on youtube: [...]
B00EUS9JF0|5.0|When Paul McCartney releases a new album, his fans find themselves in the midst of a contradiction. On the one hand, being a McCartney devotee means that you've long since stopped paying attention to what critics have to say about his post-Beatles career. On the other hand, at some level you really want the critics, and the general public, to like him, damn it! You want them to give him his due as one of the greatest songwriters of all time, a creative force whose every album contains at least a handful of tracks (and, often enough, more than a handful) that can stand quite comfortably with his 1963-1970 output, who's still more than capable of great things. Especially since we know that the critical bylines--that Paul too often commits half-baked ideas to tape, that he works better with an editor or collaborator to push him out of his comfort zone, that he's sometimes content to coast on his undeniable melodic genius--are actually true in a lot of ways.<br /><br />And so, as a friend observed recently, we await each new record with a mixture of elation and trepidation. (After all, Paul sets a high standard - nobody likes to be disappointed.) But after listening many, many times to Paul's latest record, NEW, in the past week, I think we can set aside trepidation and give in to elation. Because this is a great record.<br /><br />What most impresses me about NEW is the musical richness that's evident throughout the album. \\"Save Us\\" opens the record with a potent two-and-a-half-minute burst of rock n' roll, propelled by a crunchy riff and tight harmonies. The mellotron-draped \\"Queenie Eye,\\" with lyrics drawn from a Liverpudlian children's rhyme and a raucous piano drawn straight from [[ASIN:B0025KVLU6 The White Album]], constitutes a minor masterpiece. The folky \\"Early Days\\" may be the album highlight for me, a sweetly emotional yet unsentimental look back at Paul's teenage years, set against a clean, folky backdrop. But then there's the title track, which, with its bouncy harpsichords and playful horns, would've scaled the charts in 1967. In these songs, Paul's much-lauded mastery of melody is wedded to a meticulous attention to sonic detail that really pays off.<br /><br />It's not NEW's highlights that carry it, however, so much as its consistently high standards of songwriting and production. None of the aforementioned gems occupy quite the same echelon as latter-day classics on [[ASIN:B000002ULO Flaming Pie]] (1997) or [[ASIN:B000AL730O Chaos and Creation in the Backyard]] (2005), for instance. But the rest of the album is so good, you barely even notice that. Every song is fully realized, brimming with inventive arrangements, impeccable harmonies (even for Paul), and atmospheric variation - witness the difference in tone (though not quality) between the joyous, up-tempo \\"Turned Out,\\" the wispily ethereal \\"Hosanna,\\" and the industrial, experimental (for Paul at least) \\"Appreciate.\\" Even on \\"filler\\" cuts like the humdrum ballad \\"Looking at Her\\" and the [[ASIN:B007L96VCY RAM]]-like throwaway \\"Get Me Out of Here,\\" precise vocal arrangements and electronic breaks keep the proceedings exciting.<br /><br />Alright, sure, Paul's propensity for lyrical laziness rears its head now and again - for example, both \\"Alligator\\" and \\"Everybody Out There,\\" while great tunes in their own right, might've benefited from revision. But that's decidedly the exception, not the rule, a question not of salvaging bad songs but rather of improving good ones. And interestingly enough, the critics have taken note: Allmusic.com's review of the album calls it \\"one of the best of McCartney's latter-day records.\\" To be fair, the critics seem to have selective amnesia, insofar as they've been saying the same about every original album Paul has released since 1997. But this is simply further proof that at 71, Paul McCartney, far from inching his way into retirement, is alive and kicking, still capable of coming up with something NEW.
B0087GZ8YW|4.0|Book #18, in the Inspector Rebus series.<br /><br />After five years into retirement Rebus is back only to find himself in trouble, what else is new? We should have known better to think Rankin would have put his best protagonist to pasture. He is just too good a character to have done so.<br /><br />Still his old self, drinking and smoking to excess, Rebus now in a civilian capacity works for the serious crime review looking into cold cases of long forgotten victims. He pairs up with his old prot&eacute;g&eacute;e, Siobhan Clarke, and they embark on an investigation that will see them hopping all over Scotland even into the most remote of places. All along the way the author expertly spins a suspenseful tale one that could have been hard to put down if it wasn't for countless countryside description and poetically villages names and the constant moments when Rebus lights another cigarettes or opts for another drink.<br /><br />As always Mr. Rankin is impressive at handling plot complication and adding twists to force his protagonist in taking unorthodox action, having a seditious behaviour and ignoring protocol. He is not a team player and never will and is well aware that he is out of step with the new way of working….but Rebus will rise up to the task and show us how to get the job done….he is in top shape to tackle anything…<br /><br />I am glad Mr. Rankin resuscitated his grumpy old detective. This series was the author’s best and still is IMO.

B00B9LNJ9I|5.0|BOTH &#34;NO ANGEL&#34; & SAFE TRIP HOME&#34; HAD PERSONAL MEANING FOR ME. WITH THE EXCEPTION OF A FEW SONGS TO WHICH I CAN RELATE, THIS ONE DOES NOT. HAVING SAID THAT, THIS ALBUM IS FULL OF EMOTION & HAS DEPTH, WHICH IS ALWAY FLOWING FROM DIDO. HER VOICE IS LOVELY, THE VARIETY OF SONGS IS OUTSTANDING & THE MELODIES ARE BEAUTIFUL. I'LL BE ENJOYING THIS ALBUM, ALONG WITH HER OTHERS, FOR A VERY LONG TIME.

B00C7JGDBW|5.0|Great movie to show how OZ got to the Land of Oz.  Great new characters and it does lead up to how the Witches became who they were.  The only part I would complain about the movie is that there isn't any chemistry between Franco and Williams to make you believe they love each other.  Mila Kunis did a great job as Theodora.
B009EEFTMC|5.0|Great game!  We have enjoyed playing this game on our Fire HD.  We just received our new Fire HDXs and Amazon shows that this version won't work on the new HDX. We are hoping the developer will update it to work on the HDX.

B00ARHAAZ6|5.0|Seriously, I think I enjoyed reading this as much as anything I've read in the past decade. Every book Brandon Sanderson releases is an improvement on the last. He is a true master storyteller and has proven time and again why he is the best author writing at this time. Steelheart was from start to finish a pleasure to read and had the pulse and attitude of a great movie. The visuals were fantastic, the pace was quick and perfect and the dialogue was both funny and real. I loved it and I can't wait for the next.

B005HSL626|5.0|This game is the best most entertaining mind challenging game I have liked so far. I would recommend this game to people of all ages.
B00AHSIQWE|4.0|I had three reservation regarding the movie: 1) how would they respond to the phenomenal success of the second movie; 2) could Ann Hathaway really portray Selena Kyle; and 3) the selection of Bane as the villain.  Items 2 and 3 were based on character definitions developed in the comics and cartoons.  The movie deviated from those definitions making the characters (and therefore the actor's portrayal) more believable.<br /><br />Heath Ledger was exceptional as the Joker in the second movie.  Frankly, I did not expect that this movie would be as good.  I was more concerned that it would be a significant let down in comparison.  It would have been shocking to equal the effect of the second movie.  However, the third installation was quite entertaining.  The story flowed well; and most importantly (without giving anything away) it ended well.  A fit conclusion to a well thought out trilogy.<br /><br />Do I recommend this film: yes.  I also intend on buy the trilogy and place it in my collection.  Most of these franchises are not worth collecting IMHO.  This one is.

1435107683|5.0|For the past few weeks, my almost-five-year-old little boy has been having nightmares about owls.  The only way he will go to sleep is if our youngest cat, Molly Kitten, will curl up on his bed with him.  She will stay awake until my son falls asleep.  We thought these nightmares were imaginary because neither my husband nor I had seen an owl... until one night.  My husband was just putting my son back into bed and telling him there are no owls when he heard, \\"Whooooo.  Whoooo.\\"  He looked out the window and saw two glowing owl eyes.  Molly jumped up to the window, tapped on the glass with her paw, and the owl flew away.<br /><br />The other day, I took my son to the bookstore and let him pick out any book he wanted.  He picked out Owl At Home, so we bought it and took it home and read it.  Owl At Home is a very likable owl, as likable, in fact, as Frog and Toad.  He just doesn't get the same attention that Frog and Toad do.  It's a pity, really, because apparently owls do need a positive mascot when it comes to kids.<br /><br />This book, like the Frog and Toad books, is written and illustrated with scads of charm that holds up well to repeated, and often very slow, readings.  Sometimes the \\"classics\\" really are the best.
0375869026|5.0|We read all levels of books with our 7 year old.  No book has resonated more strongly with him than this one.  We first read this with him when he was 6, and have since read it two more times.  He now has it as an audio book and listens to it regularly.  Our son is twice-exceptional and has a number of learning challenges and differences.  I think the story resonates well with him, both from relating in some small way to Auggie, but also to the many other struggles and challenges children face in navigating friendships in the world.  It is a beautiful story with many lessons, about how to be good and true in this world, no matter who you are.
B0055SWM08|1.0|I have completed the game with all levels perfect, collected all jewels, and got all 35 achievements. I saw a new update and was eager to see what was new. Turned out nothing really changed, except all levels have been reset from perfect to completed. Really? I am not going to play the same game again.<br /><br />Dev should fix that problem.
B004UNX1LS|4.0|It's a really great app if you need to entertain kids  and really great for on the go .it rarely stops to buffer and has a lot of really great vidios.<br /><br />I suggest vivo for new kindle users so that they can also watch great movies that entertain them.

B005LAII44|3.0|I am not sure why the marketed this as a reboot.  It picks up right where the last movie left off.<br /><br />It's not a bad flic, but nowhere near a great one.  It's just is.<br /><br />The problem with this series was G.I. Joe was a pro American cartoon.  It was outlandish and over the top over patriotic U.S. ALL THE WAY.  That is what the kids of my generation where indoctrinated on every Saturday morning.  Don't believe me? Listen to the cartoons theme song.  Hell, the show was on USA network hosted by Sgt Slaughter.  Where am I going with this you ask? Easy, This movie series LOST all that, all the cornball charm of the cartoon when they dumped all the pro America overtones and marketed it to a world wide audience.  I feel because of that this movie series didn't do well because it didn't resonate with my generations memories of the show.<br /><br />Bottom line.<br />If you seen the 1st one, this one picks up the story and does a good job continuing it.  The acting/actors are far better in this one and the CGI is much improved. It is not a bad movie, it just lacks the charm of the series it was based off of.
B00846REIS|5.0|This author was a surprise for me loved how she writes, she has a very nice writing and does a great job on description and the depth of the characters.  I don't want to give anything way but it is a intense ride this collection Im a crossfire fan.
B005LAIIN0|3.0|This movie seemed to me, to be missing a lot of exposition.<br /><br />I never read the books so I can only go from what I saw in the movie, and I've watched it a few times just to see if I missed something the 1st few times.<br /><br />I liked the start of the movie, with the whole New York collapsing thing  and the chaos that ensued but as the movie went on ... It  jumped the sha...Zombie a few times before the end.  Korea part was okay, science guy inadvertently killing himself IN A ZOMBIE FLIC was dumb/lame/weak writing (you pick).  (random thought, why didn't the SF guys just get on the plane as well? They didn't want a chance to get back to America? Zombie outbreak and no one wanted to go Home?)<br /><br />The real flaw came from the Isreal part (no clue why this caused international outcry for the glorification of Isreal) because it was stupid ... the whole part ... nonsensical.  So Israel built a giant wall .. fine I can accept that! They let in the Palestinians so they wouldn't have to fight them as zombies later ... fine!  The zombies massing on the wall because of the singing ... WHICH WAS QUIETER THAN THE CHOPPERS (which weren't Apache gunships) flying overhead?  Then somehow the zombies gained super zombie strength to do two things.  One, not be squished by the incredible weight on top of them as they piled up the wall. Two, not be smashed to a useless pulp when they jumped from the top down to the ground below.<br /><br />The Airplane part was really the second Zombie jump in a row.  Where/When/How did a zombie get below? How did no one around the flight attendant notice? and how freaking convenient that Pitt and the wounded Israeli soldier survived.  Honestly, they should of let the plane land, zombie pops out as they unload cargo and everyone in England dies ... This would of continued the interesting trend of Pitt's character killing everyone around him everywhere he goes as soon as he shows up.<br /><br />The England/clinic part was pretty good inall honesty.<br /><br />I just didn't get the cure part.  Meningitis was a mask for the zombies? Then what about everyone else who suffers from a disease?  Why don't people with STD's get a pass from the zombies?<br /><br />I loved the Dawn of the Dead remake. Why you ask? Because it was a simple OMG zombies everywhere lets just try to survive and escape.  Because of that there weren't very many issues/plot hole created.  WW Z just tried too hard to do too many things and  it didn't come together well.  I'd say, wait for it to hit the $5 bin or it to appear on netflix.

B00E34A9FU|5.0|This is the Holy Grail. Not just for admirers of the Grateful Dead. But for humanity.  Sunshine Daydream, the commercially released audio and video recordings from the 8/27/72 Veneta, Oregon Springfield Creamery Benefit show, captures the Dead doing what they do best: Putting on a party with a family atmosphere. The Springfield Creamery Benefit was billed as a picnic, and when you see the footage from that day, it was in many ways a gigantic picnic--kids running around having fun, adults dancing naked in a total state of bliss, and general good-natured outdoor afternoon fun.<br /><br />The show was also a benefit, not just for a struggling creamery, but for humanity (those 15-20,000 people lucky enough to bask in the sunshine of the day at the show and those of us lucky enough to rely on the ingenious recording and re-mastering techniques of the Dead family's magicians who were able to create such a faithful document to the day that we can listen to and enjoy today). Asked about doing benefit shows, Jerry Garcia said, \\"When we do them, it's usually for our friends [...]. The benefit for us is to be able to give people music, that's a benefit, that's the real benefit that we can provide.\\" What a deep benefit the Grateful Dead have left us with their 2,300+ shows, many of which are available commercially or for free through taping networks and websites. I can't count the number of times the Dead have made me feel blissful and remind me of just how beautiful this world is, and Sunshine Daydream just might be the pinnacle of that expression.<br /><br />IIn a time of government shutdowns, another Garcia quote worth remembering is from a conversation with a Yale law professor: \\"I've always thought that the Grateful Dead should be sponsored by the government or something. It should be a public service, you know, and they should set us up to play at places that need to get high.\\" The happiness the band left with attendees, particularly at this show, was extraordinary. And even when we struggle with the budget, one wonders just how much better the world would be with happiness brought to us by a house band--Lord knows we need it.<br /><br />8/27/1972, otherwise known as the Springfield Creamery Benefit, played at the Renaissance Grounds in Veneta, Oregon, on a improvised stage put together with trees fallen by the Merry Pranksters of Ken Kesey fame, is 3 hours of happiness and rightfully one of the top 5 most requested Dead shows. But listening to this recording made me reflect on just how wonderful 1972 was for the Dead. I've already spent considerable digital ink reflecting on just how wonderful 1973 was, but 1972 is just as extraordinary and sets the tone for '73. 1972 has more of the bluesy Americana sound while '73 is more about what I'll call the space jazz, and the difference might reside in Jerry switching from his Strat to the custom-made Wolf guitar, which gave his playing and the band's sound a more jazzy feel.<br /><br />I originally fell in love with the Dead listening to the original '72 Europe recordings. I still consider many of the songs on that album to be the definitive versions-- \\"Jack Straw,\\" \\"Cumberland Blues,\\" and \\"Sugar Magnolia\\" stick out, but we could point to many nearly perfect songs from that album. After going through other recordings from 1972, the 9/21/1972 from the Philly Spectrum, captured on DP 31, really sticks out. As a review from the time indicated: \\"On a smoggy, soggy evening, in a large, darkened concert hall, the Dead managed to take every member of the capacity audience (17,500 people) to the top of a mountain on a bright sunny day. From a troubled city to wide open country.\\" The Spectrum has moments that might eclipse those captured on Sunshine Daydream. The 37-minute \\"Dark Star\\"--> \\"Morning Dew\\" is absolutely extraordinary and might even beat the stellar \\"Dark Star\\" from Veneta.<br /><br />Another indispensable recording from 1972 is Hundred Year Hall from a magical night in Frankfurt, Germany. If Beethoven died before composing the 9th, we'd still have one of the greatest composers of all time, but with the 9th he gave us something that is truly out of this world, as if it were written by a non-human entity, some deity from another galaxy. That's how I feel about the \\"Other One\\" from Hundred Year Hall. The album is great and then we get to this 36 minutes of sounds from another universe, a peak into the Dead at a creative pinnacle. Parts of it are almost unlistenable for the uninitiated, but at 19 minutes in, we get a Space Groove Phil laying down a vamp that will propel them far. At 21 minutes out they're a million light years from Earth. One worries that they've lost the song. It then becomes almost totally unlistenable, even for the initiated, but it goes further and further. At 32 minutes they're doing this insane polyrhythmic wildness beyond tribal and incorporating it back into the melody of the song which kicks back in again. No sane person would listen to this but that's why I'm OK with not being sane. And I think most Deadheads that are fans of the Dead's improvisatory prowess will appreciate this jewel.<br /><br />What sticks out from Sunshine Daydream is the visual documentary from the show. Prior to making a film of the Dead, Garcia asked why would anyone want to see a movie of us. \\"We just stand there.\\" But there's something striking about the loose, family atmosphere that the band create on stage. My wife and I were lucky enough to catch the film of the show on the big screen at the annual Deadhead Meet-up. The visuals really capture the mantra oft-repeated: \\"There is nothing like a Grateful Dead concert.\\" Besides images of the blissful Deadheads dancing, what sticks out from the show is Garcia's picking on \\"Dark Star.\\" Technique-wise, Garcia had one of the best right hands that I can think of and his missing finger made his picking styles really unique. He truly was a banjo man playing an electric guitar and that made his sound so unique, so Americana.<br /><br />In the film, there is an image of Garcia in the midst of some deep, profound, introspective and dazzling technical guitar licks that counterposes with a hippie hanging naked from a pole behind the stage, deep in a state of trance, totally mesmerized by the band's playing, looking almost like Jesus hanging from the cross. This image says a lot about the band, Garcia, and the hippie movement, already in a state of decadence in 1972; yet, here on the Renaissance Fair Grounds in Oregon on this hot day, this was the time's idealism at its most perfect state, a truly beautiful capturing of what was beautiful about the Deadheads.<br /><br />I'm much more interested in the Dead's music than in the scene that developed around the band, which unfortunately unraveled in a number of hypocrisies, but when it was good, it was really good. The Deadheads brought a warm environment, based on communal sharing, and a spirit that was genuinely driven to create a better world. At its worst, Jerry suffered the same fate that Jesus did: Too many of his followers misinterpreted the message and used it for evil rather than good. And evil isn't really the right word here, but more of a misguided close-mindedness might hit closer. Which is also part of the naive experience that the spiritual experience of a Dead show or a religious experience can do to people.<br /><br />The Veneta show could be any show from 1972, good but not very descript, until we get to the \\"China Cat Sunflower--->I Know You Rider,\\" in particular the bridge between \\"China Cat\\" and \\"Rider.\\" Phil starts the first song with a really loose and huge slide down his bass that gets the selection off on the right foot, but it's Bobby's \\"rhythm guitar solo,\\" a lead solo played by and like a rhythm guitarist that triggers Jerry's virtuosity on a lead guitar solo that streams so smoothly and elegantly that it takes the listener to a far-off better place in only the way that the Grateful Dead can do. As drummer Mickey Hart said, the Dead aren't in the music business per se, but the transportation business. Their music is the perfect traveling music--nomadic, wandering, deeply western in its looseness and themes of rambling gamblers and old West shoot outs. So far West that it goes East in its spacey mysticism. It moves and it moves the listener. The music transports the listener to other times and places. This \\"China-Rider\\" is just as good as it gets. I've always thought the 1972 versions of the selection were the best with the 1973 space jazz transition into the funkier, almost comic book-like or cartoonish, decadent \\"China-Riders\\" of 1974 were also profoundly amazing. 1972 is the year when it's clear that Bobby can carry his weight. Fired at one point because he was always late on the chunk of his rhythm guitar playing, Bobby has slipped into his role and he starts leading the band at points. When the Dead as a whole are really on, it's Bobby's  playing that adds that extra spark.<br /><br />The Veneta versions of \\"Bird Song\\" of \\"Playing in the Band\\" are definitive. \\"Playing in the Band\\" is in its most adventurous incarnation. It's almost as if it's a game for the band to see how far they can take the song out as far as it can go into spooky spaciness and then somehow they bring it back and slowly work the melody back in and bring it back to the head. This really is the holy grail.<br /><br />The Veneta version of \\"Bertha\\" is lively and colorful. The images of the tie-dye shown during the movie will forever be ingrained in my head when I hear \\"Bertha;\\" they're really done so well.<br /><br />In between selections, we get water reports (\\"save your water, it's hot!\\") and the report of a fire truck coming to spray water on the crowd in 100+ degree heat, which gets a huge rise from the crowd. We also get reports on lost kids and kids missing their parents. What's special about a Dead show, which is really more an experience or a jubilee, the town dance, a spectacle, isthat the Dead experience is all about a family atmosphere.<br /><br />The liner notes include the petition that Deadheads signed requesting that this show be released. Though now regarded as a legendary show, what's truly spectacular is that this was just another show during that year. That similar enthusiasm, similar energy was brought by fans coming to the Renaissance Fair Grounds. But like several other shows from 1972, the 8/27/72 show stands out as one of the best shows the band ever played. It just might be the holy grail.
B004JN1CW4|5.0|If you read the first two books, you probably have some idea of how this book will go. Well... YOU DON'T. It was a very emotional book, some suprises, and the end was one of those 'it's better than perfect, it's realistic!'
B00CNQ7CRI|5.0|I have to say it was laugh out loud funny!  Was hugely disappointed about Mark's terrible demise,  Enjoyable read.  Bridget Jones will not disappoint.  The Botox scene was hilarious!!! .  Had me in tears! Love to read about her daily struggles and approach to living her life on her terms.  Glad to see the return of Bridget now will be complete if movie is the works as well!
B003F3FJQO|5.0|Tommy is the best male character ever! And in this book you get to see a little more of his reactions, and how real they are. It's probably one of the main characters we can mostly relate to, cuz he is not perfect prince charming, he is a teen and thinks like a teenager would!<br />The book has a lot of ups and downs, very well written, and exciting!
B00D3LA5WG|3.0|After seeing all the promos on TV....I thought I really have to see this movie.  Just goes to show you what great marketing programs Hollywood has in place.  Movie was just OK.

B00BRUQ7ZY|5.0|Challenging thoughts, but might prove too emotionally challenging to those who desparately clutch literal truths in any of the three major religions descendant from Abraham.  This is excellent for those who can not go back to when the Earth was flat and the beliefs our parents had were absolute facts.
0061950726|5.0|Very good book about orphans who were shipped by train from east coast cities, mostly New York, and sent to the midwest . Many were exploited as labor and not well recieved. The book ties in with a modern day foster child about to \\"age out\\" of the system. I attended a lecture by the author about how the book was researched and found out the  train riders as they were called have reunoins [ which is now mostly attended by the offspring and kin due to the age of the original riders,most have passed on]. The trains ran from 1854 to 1929 at which time the railroad [who was footing the cost] stopped doing it. Some were met by loving families and most were used only as labor,often sleeping in barns. The book ties the two main characters together in a moving story. Many of the city children were Irish and Italian and this was all during a time of extreme prejudice against these peoples. Excellent well written book.

B007EC27QM|5.0|This calculator is multi-window compatible on my Samsung Galaxy S3 (very few apps are). This means you can have it running on the top or bottom of the screeb while another app is open. In addition to that, it has tons of features that are displayed the first time you open the app. It keeps a running history of all of your calculations. There's a delete button that works the way it should, you can copy and paste, you can swipe the memory bar to reveal more features such as a square root button. Best simple calculator I've ever used!
B0002KVUL6|5.0|Just what my son wanted. Watches this alot.
B000JMKTLO|2.0|I liked Gone Girl and thought I'd enjoy another book by the same author, but no, this was unnecessarily gory and perverted and not worth the read!  more like a horror movie than an interesting psychological thriller.
1416972242|5.0|Gift for my son, he loves it.
B006LSZECO|4.0|A psychological thriller which is intelligent and has a captivating story line.  It holds together well and is well written.  But I would warn readers that an earlier book by this author, Sharp Objects, does not even come close to this book in quality of writing and is more of a perverted horror story than a thriller.  Gone Girl was a good read!
B004CLYKLI|3.0|Coming from a different perspective the book was not believable to me. It is hard to believe that a mother could be that hard on her daughters even if that was &#34;CHINESE&#34; . Would she have been that hard on a son? I am sure that there were good times with the girls and that all day would not be spent in pushing the girls. The book was all about that part of their childhood and had little balance. And was it worth it? What about the other part of their lives? Sorry, I didn't like it.
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|The real candy crush is finely on Amazon!! I love this game and so does everyone I know. We all play it every chance we get!! Great game!!
B00C8S9VKM|5.0|Bryson has a knack that of telling  you what is what and you find yourself wrapped in another of his wanderings. Some writers pull you down and others lift you up, not because of the subject matter but because of his/her way of telling a story, true or fiction. This one is a true delight.
B00FRQ32N4|4.0|This game is pretty friggin cool. I saw the movie and the game brings it to the real world a little bit. The controls are fairly straight forward. And i like the upgrade system. Also the fact that i can fight real people right next to me or not is a big plus. There are some things I think could have been done better, but all in all for a free download, this game rocks ^_^
B009JZTP4Y|3.0|This movie sets the scene for introducing the various characters and the roles they will play in future movies.  I enjoyed the second half of the movies better than the first half.
B00BUVPIRS|3.0|It's ok, I guess. It's not like skyrim I think. I also don't think the graphics are  &quot;STUNNING&quot; or &quot;AMAZING&quot; but, you know. It also gives you crappy armor and throws you in a maze of tunnels to fight 1,000,000 cave trolls(exaggeration, of course but there's a freaking CRAPLOAD of them!). But those were the flaws, these are the good things.<br /><br />  The game itself is pretty fun and I just love murdering little helpless goblins. It's very realistic because you have to eat in order to survive, so that's pretty cool. Um, one last thing before I go, if you're a girl please note YOU CAN'T BE A GIRL IN THIS GAME. I believe you can in Aaralon but I'm not sure. If your a skyrim lover watch and subscribe thetexv, I love his videos and I'm going to subscribe also pretty soon so, yeah just look up his channel on YouTube. Wow I can't believe your still reading this. It's done now. Bye.
B009NNG202|2.0|It is a very dark movie, very slow moving story that is difficult to hold your interest.  It needs to speed up its premise. Acting is good and period piece is realistic.
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|Love candy crush it is a awesome but level 23 is.very hard to beat so rock on and keep playing
0385351399|4.0|First of all, if you have not read any Dave Eggers books before, you might get frustrated at the very slow building of the plot. I found myself at page 300 saying, \\"Come on Dave, move it along.\\" But this is what happened with \\"Heartbreaking...genius\\", \\"...Velocity!\\" and even to some degree \\"What is the What\\" as far as my memory recalls.<br /><br />If you are in agreement with the overall premise of Eggers book, you should find yourself growing frustrated with the main character, Mae. You should feel disgust with her actions. You should shake your head and say, \\"Why don't you GET it?\\" You should find yourself wondering how ANYONE could believe such things. And if at the end, you find this is what you felt, then that means Eggers got his point across.<br /><br />While the technology and campus of The Circle might be distorted and inaccurate for some reviewers, the book is not being narrated from an outsider's point of view. You should see discrepancies. This book is being narrated as if Mae can do no wrong. If such a company were trying to do such things, their own press would paint a rosy picture focusing on the \\"fun\\" and \\"social\\" aspects instead of the mundane tasks. I feel the descriptions fit with the overall theme of the book.<br /><br />And in case you don't get the point, Eggers puts a very clear metaphor near the end that illustrates it very clearly. Eggers did not trick me with his unveiling, but then he also gave the clues for the astute reader to pick up. I've written before that I like when writers reward readers for paying attention, and Eggers does not disappoint.<br /><br />Yes, you will see similarities with other dystopian novels. I feel the difference with this one is that you see it from the POV of the creator of that dystopia and not as an outsider. Sure, you read it as an outsider but you read the words of the insiders and not the victims.<br /><br />I held back a star because I felt the ending needed something more.
B004J4XGN6|5.0|Still reading it, but as a college student with a strong interest in tech and the start-up environment, this book is very informative and ground-breaking. Also, it's my first book I'm reading on my Kindle app and it's going well!
B007SGLZP8|5.0|This is an enjoyable mystery/legal thriller that takes twists and turns that will keep you guessing. Fast paced easy to read.

B009FXIICK|2.0|It was a  free game so can not complain much.  I find it to be a bit boring.  Probably will not play it much. I will remove it from my kindle fire.
B00E3UN44W|5.0|After waiting with mounting impatience for Season 3, it was an absolute joy to review it early.<br />  The first question on my mind was, of course, \\"How the heck did Sherlock survive the fall?!\\"<br />Well, if you're reading this, you don't mind spoilers: he didn't. He died, and was whisked away by Molly Hooper to a secret laboratory in the Sussex Downs (disguised as a branch of the Apiculturists' Association) There, he was reanimated via electricity using a technique Molly learned while studying in Ingolstadt; sharp-eyed viewers will remember this was foreshadowed in \\"The Hounds of Baskerville\\".<br />  He then spent three years in Pakistan and Tibet under the alias of Sigerson Paget, taking out Moriarty's crime syndicate while avoiding suspicion with little more than contact lenses, various hair dyes, and a stoop-shouldered walk.<br />(How he could keep a low profile with an alias like that is another question entirely.) On his travels, he crossed paths with a truly ruthless sniper by name of Sebastian Moran, who had been Moriarty's second-in-command.<br /><br />Sherlock's return was beautifully done, and I thoroughly enjoyed the Reunion Scene: John's mixture of shock, anger at the deception, and ultimately cracking a zombie joke was a true tour de force. His reunion with Mycroft was equally priceless, and I cackled loud and long seeing Mycroft I-am-the-British-Government Holmes FAINT at the sight of his little brother.<br /><br />Now on to the episodes:<br />  THE EMPTY HEARSE: When a prominent businessman's body is found missing from his hearse, it is discovered that a former cagefighter named Rathbone -\\"Rat\\" for short- known as the Giant of Sumatra, is operating an organ trafficking ring; \\"Rat\\" enlists Moran's help in an attempt on Sherlock's life in retaliation, which is foiled spectacularly by use of an extremely life-like animatronic double.<br />  (Sherlock keeps the double for target-practice afterward, in a fit of black humor/attempt at guilt-tripping hisformer flatmate over John's engagement to Mary Morstan)<br /> THE SIGN OF THREE: This adventure begins with John and Mary's wedding -Sherlock's the best man!- interrupted though it is by Tomás Sholto's band of three-fingered assassins: the \\"Six Pearls\\" abduct Mary under the belief that she knows the location of a priceless treasure, leading our heroes on a suspenseful chase along the Thames to save her from their clutches.<br /> One would think that after the Black Lotus assassins in Season 1, the novelty would wear off, but I was riveted by these new antagonists nonetheless.<br />  HIS LAST VOW: A dark tale of intrigue, startling avowals, and a fortune in stolen jewels hidden in the bow of a ship, it ends on such a heart-wrenching cliff-hanger that I can't bring myself to write it here. Whyyyy, Moffat&Gatiss?!

The characters were endearing.<br />- I didn't mind the interludes of massive back-story. I read quickly and felt that these added rather than detracted like others have mentioned.<br />- Yes, I also want to be able to turn into a gigantic robot.
B005PK57IK|5.0|This show has a lot of heart.  Each character brings such great chemistry to each episode and they often surprise me.  I am totally addicted and forfeit sleep to watch just one more episode.

B005LAIIMG|5.0|After hearing all of the hype about this movie's problems, it turned out very well. Loved the zombies actually able to run and chase rather than aimlessly wander around grabbing people available nearby. There were some really awesome terrifying scenes that were realistic as far as people's reactions to a terrorizing event. Highly recommended!

0385720920|5.0|The book came a lot quicker than expected. And ordering it used, even in 'good' condition, I expected a little cosmetic wear and tear but I was pleasantly surprised to find that the book looked virtually brand new. I can't express just how exhuberant I was to open the package and see the book in such a fabulous state.
B00CL0J99K|5.0|Loved this movie, I have never watched a movie of this type without appreciating it to the fullest. I hope this genre never dies out and continues forever.
B00FPGV3RS|2.0|While the critics disliked this movie I normally find that I enjoy most movies that are panned by them. Not this time.  Not very funny.  Appears to be an attempt at recreating Men in Black at some level but really misses badly.
B00E3IZIM0|5.0|I haven't received it yet but I am looking forward to viewing the movie, the commercials about it look really great. I hope it lives up to the commercial that I have seen.
B00BEZTMWW|5.0|Eagerly awaiting the extended version, but love this movie.  Adjusted our flat-screen to a vibrant screen setting and really love it especially with this film
B00AZMFK3K|5.0|Loved this movie, I have never watched a movie of this type without appreciating it to the fullest. I hope this genre never dies out and continues forever.
B002KGEORM|5.0|Just discovered the series. This show is addictive so fair warning! You can't watch just one episode so plan on that before you start.
B004LROMX4|5.0|Great Series, I truly like this type of series, the actors are great and the premise of the story line in captivating. I hope it last a long time.
B007VUCAVO|5.0|This app helps me to know when my battery is getting low.  It also helps me to see when another app is taking a lot of juice.  I use it often.  It doesn't seem to use much juice itself.  Perhaps some people leave it on.  I view it and then turn it off, or switch to another activity.
B003SJ4VJ6|1.0|I don't know what the point of the movie was, except maybe to dis America.  It was totally pointless and had the most unsatisfying and awful ending. Yuk.  I love Ewan McGregor, but this was a waste of his time.
B004YXE438|4.0|If you like photographic details this simple puzzle, with its three degrees of difficulty and four levels of granularity, then this app is worthy.  Found it to be operationally agreeable as one can check back to the completed puzzle and, more importantly, when you have found things have gotten rather confused you can reduce the difficulty level.  It keeps track of time, granularity, difficulty level at completion and interestingly enough how many moves one employed to solve the puzzle.<br /><br />If you are like me and need to give your creative mind a respite, give it a little time to operate relatively unencumbered by it logical counterpart, then this geometric distraction might serve you as well as it is I.
B004MC8CA2|5.0|Love this. even though you need wifi to access it if you haven't downloaded each individual bible version, it is neat if your church is using it and you can access sermon notes from your church that day, and all sorts of other stuff. Neat app.
B000O8OTNC|4.0|good piece - I love it<br />Valuable, useful and helpful<br />I recommend the users to use it it's great piece
B00FAPF5U0|4.0|This is a really fun game and I was glad to see it on my Kindle. But I don't like waiting after I run out of lives. And there is no way I am paying cash to get more lives. So I play a free game or do housework while my lives timer counts down.
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|I'm in love!! Way to addicting!! I cant put it down!! So glad I can play on my kindle now!
B00B6QXN56|5.0|Been a fan of Joe for twelve Years this album has to be his best. All the music is an extended version of music he has done before but these arrangement sound like brand new songs.
B001GAPC1K|5.0|The first Iron Man is one of the best comic book superhero movies ever made. It not only jump-started the Marvel movie franchise leading to the $1.5 billion Avengers flick but is also an excellent standalone film. And yes, Robert Downey, Jr IS Iron Man!
B003L7DK74|5.0|Absolutely hilarious! Totally stoked that I have both seasons finally! I wish there were more seasons, these guys are amazing.
B003B02O7I|5.0|You have to ask yourself, \\" what is your purpose in life ?\\"  Reading this book made me think about this question.  And my answer is, live for each day and ones who supports your decisions.
B00FWLDHSY|3.0|Better than I expected. Lots of fun!  I wish I saw it on the big screen in 3-D. Director Guillermo Del Toro does it again!
1423124111|5.0|I got this originally for myself but ended up giving it to my best friend as a Christmas Gift. He loves Disneyland as much as I do and this was the perfect gift. The artwork is awesome!
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|I've been waiting for this game to come out on the kindle for about 2 years now and it's a great  game so I thin  you should get it and +it's FREE
B00FJTYDKK|4.0|We rented the movie for my 5 and 9 year old daughters,they loved it. They said it was funny, and a good story.
B009UX2YAC|4.0|The game is fun! The only reason that I wouldn't give it five stars is because sometimes you get in situations that you have nowhere to go.
B008ALA6DW|5.0|For me is very important this connection, i am work every day with network and wifi connection. I recommended this product
B0091XRRQC|4.0|The bits from the preview are good, but as an entire film it drags a bit.  I love Wallace and Grommet, but found their feature length film to similarly drag.  Stick to shorts.
B000LB7G00|5.0|if you are a modeling fool you will greatly appreciate the added flexibility offered in this tough little guy. Nice and heavy to stay put on the desk, smooth movement in every axis. This is a good quality durable product that seems like it will give years of service while sitting for 10 hours a day staring at a computer screen creating 3d models of hardware which will in turn be used to make somebody else rich beyond your wildest dreams.
B00AKKS278|5.0|This is an awesome book with a TON of great ideas. If you're needing a kick in the butt here it is. Bonus: Audible made it easy to drive and listen.
B00FAPF5U0|2.0|I am so glad the app is on kindle now. one of the best app avail. I love it. able to see better.
B00FWPWNKS|5.0|Lots of challenges. Hard game to put down. First game was great but they made it better. I highly recommend this game.
B009ZZDNT6|5.0|it works very well as an alarm clock ,,,I just wish this stupid adstrying to sell you something would stop showing up on screen
B00400NHRO|1.0|This book was recommended to me by colleges as a satire of the life of a doctor. I am a young emergency physician and was shocked at how lewd and unprofessional this trashy book is. Perhaps in the 70s you could get away with this but many parts of this book would get you fired immediately now. I hate to think the public would think we doctors are fantasising about having sex with nurses during a code.  Unless you are addicted to porn don't waste your time with this.
B00A6CCF0K|1.0|Stephen king has been on the decline for so long now that his bad years out number the good.<br /><br />This book is a long, drawn-out, piece of rubbish that tarnishes its predecessors shine.<br /><br />Boring on every level, it's immpossible to find anything to like.<br /><br />This book has nothing to do with the Shining, and bares no resembalance. It's not scary. It's not creepy. It's BORING and DUMB.<br /><br />Keep moving folks. Nothing to see here.
B001S86J0I|5.0|This one my list of all time favorite funny movies--my whole family loves it, and so do all my friends.  Tim Allen plays a wonderful starship<br />commander, and Alan Rickman is great as Dr. Lazarus !  I also loved Tech Sergeant (Tony Shaloub).  He is totally believable in<br />his techie sort of character who overcomes his fear of \\"real\\" technology because of love.  Justin Long is also fantastic as the nerdy<br />Galaxy Quest groupie who saves the day when the ship is out of control.  This definitely is a must see movie.  It is also a terrific parody<br />of Star Trek groupies--costumes and make-up included.  And of course, who can forget Sigourney Weaver as the lovely Gwen DeMarco,<br />whose only job was to reiterate what ever the computer replied to questions.  This movie will strike your funnybone--\\"Never Give Up,<br />Never Surrender!\\"
B00913DPW2|5.0|No doubt this is a tough one and I'm adept at puzzle solving.  You will need help to solve a few of them..the math ones were easy, but the hanging ropes and the sound machine sequence takes patience!  No hidden objects thank goodness.  This is a very long playing game - an excellent choice for $1.99.  It downloaded quickly on my Kindle HD, and no bugs or glitches.  Personally, I love the tough puzzles - the Big Fish game puzzles are pretty lame in comparison.  Wish there more puzzles in this unique league.
B00CWY76CC|4.0|Very challenging at times. Works your brain. Couldn't stop playing it. Ready for more. Recommend it highly. My kind of game.
B00F35B8F8|3.0|I watch almost anything sci-fi, I love the genre. This is 'ok' sci-fi, unfortunately I found myself predicting a lot of what was going to happen next. The movie is good looking though and I wouldn't pass it up if you love these types of movies.
B004A2V3K0|5.0|Love it!!!! All great songs that everyone loves. And sounds just as great live! Everyone should have a copy! I play it all the time
0316069906|5.0|There are very few books, if any, that I have read so far in my life that have prompted me to change my lifestyle, but this is one of those books. Much of the basic subject matter I was already familiar with before reading this book a few years ago, as are most people I believe: our food is produced in a system where productivity and efficiency are valued over animal welfare and proper nutrition. We have all heard or seen the horror stories inside of the massive &#34;factory farms,&#34; and perhaps that made some of us think twice about our eating habits before gradually returning the ignorant bliss of convenient eating.<br /><br />This book channels all of those ideas and facts into a unique historical narrative and personal account of how we relate to food as human beings. Foer's unique writing style gives an objective and thoughtful look into to current state of the food system in the United States. He assesses our moral ideas of right and wrong, and forces the reader to measure their own moral ideas against the revealed nature of mass-produced food.<br /><br />In the end the book isn't a perfect, balanced assessment of everything in our food production system, but it is an honest and invigorating observation of why we should care about how our food comes to be on our plate every day. Foer is certainly influenced by his own personal history, and those biases  perhaps detract some from his ultimate claims. But the book is not meant to be an academic dissertation on the food we eat; it is an emotional poem, laced with ethos powered by Foer's moving prose, and if you really read it like its meant to be read, it will draw you into the ideas and make you think about them on a very deep, human level.
B003L77FYS|5.0|I absolutely love this series. One of the best shows on TV. It's hard to find a good show on TV, since everything is either sports or reality and I can't stand either one of those.
B002W7J3SO|5.0|Still holds up after all these years.  They don't make them like they used to.  Great combo.  Hitch and Grant
B00FG1Q5J8|5.0|One of the best mobile games I've ever played. Despite some glaring balance issues. I just hope they finish with all the extra content. Away team missions, boarding enemy ships, beaming down to planets, etc. That would push it over the top.
1250038820|5.0|Brandon's book really is awe inspiring. On every page there is something beautiful. I smiled and cried my way through this book. I highly recommended this book to everyone.
B003THHIEM|5.0|Great series. Hot & spicy and great mysteries. A lot of humor thrown in. Nathan Fillion is great, as usual. Stana Katic has some REAL acting skills. What chemistry between them!!
B005ZOBNOI|5.0|This was a book I could not put down. It catches you right from the beginning all the way until the end.
B005O7PXNS|5.0|Very good series. Great season for a very good series. That wasn't enough words. I guess it's not enough to just give my opinion. They require over (x) words be written.
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|This game is so much fun. Once  you start, you'll have trouble putting it down. The graphics on this version are fun'
B003TH14H4|5.0|The chemistry between the leads only gets better. I've never seen the like bar none. And I was a big Moonlighting fan. The ensemble cast at the precinct is well oiled and filled out with others having great acting skills.
B006LSZECO|4.0|It was a pretty good read. Very descriptive with almost tangible detail, which both worked for it and against it in that sometimes the book could seem to drone on, describing certain things almost endlessly. Usually wasn't the case though.<br /><br />I got emotional reactions to the characters and was drawn into the story, not wanting to put it down some days. The author seems to have a very keen grasp on human behavior and I found character actions and reactions to be very interesting and believable.<br /><br />I found some things to be really vulgar and it was off putting the way the book made light of some sensitive issues. Wish I had warning.<br /><br />Plot Spoiler:<br />*<br />*<br />*<br />*<br />*<br />*<br />I would have liked some closure to the story but understand the author's preference for keeping it the way it was. However, there was one plot hole that she didn't take into consideration, Desi could have had an alibi for any of the very specific time frames that Amy implicated him.
0061537969|5.0|Cute book. Loved Enzo. The happy ending to mortality that we can hope is real. I would love to think that all the dogs I have loved will end up like Enzo
B002MQYOFW|5.0|could not stop reading it  now on second  volume  fantastic books  but depressing world  described  characters are drawn  and plots are riveting
B005BGBPBG|2.0|Until John Krasinski's character (Eliot? Ethan?)  made his feelings known, at which point I started shouting nasty things at the screen.  The only emotionally mature, respectful, sincere and earnest, honest character- the guy that would make the perfect husband- AND she turns him down.  That was it, the movie was completely shot for me.  From then on I just gagged.
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|best game ever that is why it has over 8900 players and I love those minions!!! by the way it has great graphics!!!!!
B00821PCJS|5.0|Good series, I just wish that Amazon had carried the last season. The series is addictive and the characters are well developed.
B008GOG98Y|4.0|Good flick. It was a nice surprise. Fun to see some actors in a first role. Good energy. Watch it.
B005K17RU0|5.0|Love this new weather app!at the touch of a few buttons I can know the weather not only in my area but where my loved are as well.<br />Bubblegumgranny
B00FPH6AXE|3.0|the movie was okay - Will Smith is great - his son is okay - to son for the part he played<br />the ending was good<br />not my favorite Will Smith movie but this movie he wasn't funny or sassy - very serious role for him
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|I have looked for candy crush on amazon when i thought i had it it was a puzzle this game is not its the real deal nothing else connect to facebook or you could start over and do it all over again  if you get it you will be adicted  for ever so be carefull of what you wish for
B00BUWY74M|5.0|This book is very well laid out and easy to follow.  I'm in the process of putting the training tools to use.
B007TNS6JI|5.0|This is an AMAZING game<br />I love how they set up the campaign<br />And the armour is awesome<br />Love it
B005VQRPME|5.0|who loves music, have to have this album on sacd, I listen this album everyday, this sacd sounds incredible !!
B00F8L2VO4|5.0|I'm not going to babble on about this app, but it's the best way to learn a language that I've ever seen.<br />You type in both the language you're learning and English. You speak it, choose the words, and interact with pictures. You gain coins and compete against friends.<br />Super awesome.
B006CC0YB0|5.0|Sounded exactly like I knew it would. Great music.  Great gift for my then, husband to be and now husband of one year.
B00CWY76CC|5.0|Move played every level there amazing i love this game and cant wait for the rest of the  levels to come
B002PNDEXK|4.0|As a lover of Pride and Prejudice, I have to say that this is a good movie as well.  At first i didnt think I was going to like it, but I'm glad I stuck it out.  It's one of those that I'll probably watch over and over.  Kate Winslett does not disappoint!
B00FAX6XQC|5.0|Great game and awesome graphics, I have deer hunter reloaded and it doesn't compare to this one it has way better upgrades for the guns and overall it's great.
B000I3UMKM|5.0|I adore this movie!  Audrey is spectacular, her leading man is gorgeous, and the movie is beyond entertaining.  It's a movie I can (and have) watch over and over.
B00A6CCF0K|5.0|A good read. Danny turned out just as I pictured him.  Now, what's going on with Roland and the Dark Tower?
B007UR1OHO|1.0|I thought there was no way to go wrong with this movie, considering the actors playing the main characters, but I was sadly mistaken.  Don't waste your time on this one.
B00FAPF5U0|4.0|As match three games go this is fun. It is easy to progress to the higher levels. The difficulty increases slowly I like the different task that you have. The music gets annoying but you can turn that off or down. I think the female cartoon character is miss's  Puffs sister from spongebob.
B0091W0ILY|5.0|Classic Tim Burton!  If you haven't seen this movie yet, then it's about time you did.  Great movie to add to anyones collection, perfect for all ages.
B00BMKDTNC|5.0|Waited 15 years to finally finish this series. Awesome book  . Great job by Sanderson . Recommend it to any and all fantasy lovers.
030758836X|3.0|This book pulled me in from the first paragraph and I couldn't put it down. It kept me reeling page after page, and I actually lost sleep over this book. I only wish the ending was as exciting as the beginning and middle were. I was so disappointed when I read the last page that I actually said outloud, &#34;is that it?!&#34;  It fizzled out like a bad firework. I honestly don't know whether to recommend this book or not. I will say that I won't read another of Flynn's books without a thorough reading of reviews. I will not lose sleep again over another dud.
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|Finally, Candy Crush Saga available to Kindle owners.  Thank you King and Amazon!  Endless fun, assuming you aren't stuck on the same level for weeks on end!
B0042TV4IW|5.0|This show has been wonderfully entertaining without the normal violence and  crassness that we see so much of today. Happy to give it a five!
B00CH26TL8|1.0|It was Difficult to play with my finger, guess I need a stylus.  Shouldn't have downloaded it in the first place as I don't hold with witches!  Decided to try it as it was free.
B00BRAB5ZQ|5.0|I am a huge Michael Connelly fan. I have not been a fiction reader until Det. Bosch was introduced to me by my son.<br /><br />I have already read most of the Harry Bosch series but I have ordered the first ten and was intending to read them again, this time in chronological order.  Concrete Blonde arrived first so I read it anyway, so much for plan A.  I have been a cop for 35 years including a stint as a detective including two years in homicide.  Mr. Connelly uses his tech advisoers well and his attention to small details is one of the features that draws me to the stories.<br /><br />Some of the used books I bought through Amazon came from Goodwill and similar stores.  I got one of his books for $0.28 with less than $4 shipping.  What a deal!  GO HARRY, WATCH YOUR SIX!
B00EHMG358|5.0|As all of their other books. This one grabbed my interest immediately. I have no doubt the rest of the story will be just as interesting.
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|I am so glad you guys came back to kindle fire .....yaaaaa I'm s look glad it back thanks a lot LOVE the fact we can play with face book friends
1400049628|5.0|C'mon, it's about zombies!  Love the thought of an outbreak and this is just a cool way to get ur brain amped up.  Because u just never know...
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|It is a really fun game! But be careful!!! It becomes VERY addicting!!!! I am so happy it is on my Kindle now!!! I had it for 3 days now and I'm already addicted!!! Have fun!
B008TRUDAS|5.0|This is a great book. It made me laugh and cry. Colleen Hoover created a beautiful novel full of authenticity. It's amazing.
B00FAX6XQC|5.0|I saw my friend playing it on his phone, and I thought to myself, &quot;When is it gonna come out for the Kindle?&quot; low and behold, here it is. It's so much better than Deer Hunter Reloaded
B000JMKQX0|5.0|great book.  read it in two days. highly recommend.  I never thought I would like a zombie book, don't watch the walking dead or any other zombie show/movie.
B00B2V66VS|5.0|Temple Run is the best running game there is. And it is going to be for years and years nothing will beat it.
B00CSR2J9I|4.0|I always find myself coming back to this game.  Its simple yet fun and can be put down at anytime if need be.
B005ZUR724|4.0|Pros:<br />You will almost feel like you would play wow. Quests, mechanics, characters which are reduced to 4 classes and 5 races.<br /><br />Nice graphics and so far no bugs in quests.<br /><br />Good options for pvp and pve players although there are only a few dungeons no heroic or normal mode.<br /><br />Cons:<br />What I really dont like are in game payments. If you want some epic gear ir pet or amount of gold you have to pay so ridiculous high price that its almost unbeliviable for me to do so<br /><br />Camera have to be set by finger. This is unusual especialy if you are used to play with mouse. In the other way i dont imagine better solution for controls in that game and if you play it for longer period you will find it quite comfortable. Still for hardcore pvp players it is relevant obstacle to achieve their maximum game performance without a mouse connected.<br /><br />There are still reserves in chat. I would like to have an option to write to certain person right throught the main chat window.<br /><br />Summary:<br />Very goog game wich i hope will get better and better. I hope it wont brought low after Gameloft had canceled monthly fees. There are a few mistakes but still this games provides very good MMORPG experience and i wish Gameloft luck to keep up with thier good work.
B005H9B44A|4.0|it was good had some good parts but didnt have what i expected but over all a good movie fun to watch
B00AZMFJYA|1.0|This is an adequate scifi action movie but it is not Star Trek.  It uses the Star Trek characters but there are so many problems with this movie if you are a true Star Trek fan.  I'm sure that Gene Roddenberry is turning over in his grave at what J.J. Abrams has done to his baby.  In the first movie, Abrams destroys the Vulcan home world and in this one he virtually copies The Wrath Of Khan.  In my humble opinion, J.J. Abrams has served up a huge, steaming pile of s***.  Too bad I couldn't give it zero stars.  Bottom line:  I should have rented it first.
B00A6CCF0K|4.0|I enjoyed this, but I wish it was a bit less preachy. I found it a bit less scary than old King, but as I said  enjoyable
B001P06GX4|1.0|I hate to be so upset about a game but this is my second copy ( my original was made by Sekkoia SAS) -- and it is NOT WHAT IT WAS!!!!<br /><br />The quality of the plastic pieces is lower and more like a cheesy &#34;gem&#34; than a lovely playing piece in the hand.  The sound the piece makes in the board is not a nice clack anymore but a hollow sound.  And the look of the pieces on-board has lost its loveliness.<br /><br />Alas, alas, alas.<br /><br />Plus, the original replacement pieces will not fit the smaller size squares of the Mattel board.  I'm sure they made the pieces thinner and smaller to save money, but the result rings hollow.
0439023521|5.0|Bought this for my daughter and she loved it! Great story, will be sending her the other two as soon as she is finished with this one!
B006AZZPCM|5.0|Enables me to view-stop-replay videos via Kindle. Have sat about while torqued knee heals doing knitting and crocheting not done for years. Have taken up loom knitting and learning new to me stitches.
B003IWZ1D8|5.0|Yes I liked the extra features found in the blu-ray. It was worth the buy. And will go next too my Hitchcock bio movie staring Anthony Hopkins.
B0089EHWQE|5.0|Amazing. Jojo Moyes is incredible. This is the kind of book that once you've finished you feel bereft. I'm mourning Will Traynor and his broken body and the loss of the love he deserved. I cherish the part of my day spent inside this story. Now that I know how it ends i want to find fictional louisa and hug her. Read this book now!

B00F5FBE82|4.0|The album is good but not great like I expected. Only like a few songs from the album the rest I don't care for.
B00FWLSLJ4|5.0|I have never really seen the original Kaiju wars, though I do like Godzilla, I thought that this movie was entertaining and the CG was awesome, I have a few quams with the movie but nothing worth mentioning.  I enjoyed the movie and would recommend it to any Sci Fi fan, or Kaiju war liker, mind you though it does not follow the Kaiju wars exactly, at least that is what I have been told.  Never the less a good movie.
B001ANSSDC|5.0|Great read. The movie was somewhat different but both well done entertainment. After some time now, I could go back and read it again.
B000N6TYLW|2.0|Although warned by other reviewers, viscerally I still was unprepared for the absolute train wreck of this final season.  Wow.  Although the characters are there physically, their scenes and lines often come across as forced, as if they know that the magic has already left the building.  Gone is the quick, snappy humor of seasons past.  Gone is the feel good home town Americana aspect we've all come to know and love as Stars Hollow.  A horrible end to a brilliant show.  Stars Hollow will be missed, apparently starting right from the beginning of this final season.
B00DAXYNEI|5.0|This is one of the best shows I have seen in a long time. The acting is dynamic, the storyline very engaging. It reveals the Washington inside in all its disgusting and pathetic glory. Highly addictive!
B00DHNBPA6|3.0|the original was histarical and really creepy. the remake is...less funny and less scary but still great in the &#34;gratutious&#34; catagory of bloodletting and not-necessarily needed dismenberments. pretty good film work and good sets and probably superior acting. but...without the really fun edge of the original. some things perhaps should not be polished for round two. and certainly not three.
B00D7Z4GQY|5.0|a little slow to get into and at first was hard to keep  all the characters separated.  but after a few chapters it was so interesting I could not quit reading.
B004YW4L5K|5.0|This one goes everywhere one imagines and further...where one stops imagining. Beautiful and creepy, too, American Gods strangely makes sense! I loved this work and regretted its conclusion as I wanted just one more roadside attraction...
B009LDD1X0|5.0|The story lines keep getting better as the characters develop. I own all 6 seasons and it is great having a complete story line; Re-runs do not appear in order and I miss some episodes.
B004XZR63M|4.0|This book has changed the way I spend my hard earned money.  It is a must read for all.  My only regret is that I didn't read it sooner.
B00C8RFS82|5.0|I got this one to find out just what the heck was being referred to in Iron Man 3. Paramount neatly ties this film in with others in the series: Iron Man, Thor, Hulk, et al.  So as I previously stated in a different review, there are some things being referred to in Iron Man 3 that don't make a lot of sense unless you have seen this first. Likewise, there is a bit of storyline involving Thor as well as Captain America, that were covered in previous movies.  It is a great standalone movie but it does make references to the respective movie characters being portrayed in this film.  I have a 13 year old son. He loved this so much he was climbing the walls and no the edge of the couch.  So if it can keep a kid entertained for two hours, then it's worth the money.  It's a must have for any Marvel fan, or any fan of superheroes or sci-fi action.
B008AK8FHM|4.0|As a fellow scientist, I liked the author's view or explanation of what he experienced while in a coma -- It was my first read in this area and made me think a little deeper about my spiritual side.
B007NRAHU6|5.0|I've recently been on a Robert Downey Jr. Kick and realized that I had the first film in the series, but not the second one.  This one was a bit difficult to find for me.  But that doesn't matter, I have it now, after getting an acceptable copy from a reputable seller here on Amazon.  Guy Richie directs and in typical style he makes a lot of use of slow motion action sequences, upside-down cameras, etc.  So what you end up with is an entertaining, action packed, art film, with a bit of humor thrown in.  It is also rather fast-paced.  But in my opinion it was very well done.  I also think the second one was a bit better than the first, but that is only my opinion.<br /><br />In this film we are introduced to Sherlock Holmes' brother and see some interesting,and occasionally hilarious disguises.  Spoiler alert: Robert Downey Jr.is  in drag in one scene.  Nuff said.<br /><br />This has nothing really to do with the movie but I enjoy seeing films that were either filmed in, or partially filmed in London...seeing how they depict London in 1891, compared to now (I have been there and like seeing places I have been in films) so it helps to bring the film to life for me, because, being familiar with the landscape helps me to immerse me into the story,  It at least added to my enjoyment of the film anyway.  So I thought I would throw that in there as a little side note.<br /><br />All in all, it's full of action and humor.  This is a must have for the RDJ or Jude Law fans out there.
B001UTW7QU|4.0|It is a show like no other I have seen. It keeps you guessing all the way through, is funny sometimes but not cheesy. I've just started watching but can't wait to see how the plot unfolds.
B000E6UK32|5.0|I've loved Blondie (Deborah Harry) since I was a kid, and have well abused LP records to prove it.<br />This gave me the opportunity to see the videos that I never knew existed, and with the superb audio quality of DVD!<br />Highly recommended for any Blondie fans who want to have the full audio-visual experience!
B00F7YHDWC|4.0|It's fun, but there are levels that are automatic losses because they're designed for features the Kindle doesn't have. An update would be welcome.
B004J4WKTW|5.0|Amazing imagery, great love story. I loved every minute I spent inside this circus! Highly recommended for thread vivid characters
B00DOQK2OG|4.0|Great job by the singer for covering a wide range in vocal styles , would be nice if a DVD would  be available, nice to hear temple of the king, Ritchie needs to come plug his guitar in and crank out the jams
B002CLBJPK|1.0|I was really disappointed with this video as I sat down to watch it with my kids. It is all about witch craft and makes it look like it's an innocent and fun thing that can be used for good. This is not a message I want in my house.
030758836X|5.0|This book had me guessing non stop, and once I couldn't put down.  Lots of twists and turns and once you think you have the answers.......you don't!  I am anxious to read other Gillian Flynn books.
B0046B8GEQ|5.0|Great movie, I even enjoyed it.  I purchased this for my three year old grandson.  He LOVES this movie!  During his daily quiet time, which he never falls asleep but he will lay down and rest if a movie is playing, I play this movie and he allows himself to relax and watch the movie.  I don't know how he can go all day and not fall asleep, he has more energy than any kid I have every seen...lol!  I am the one that needs the nap!
B009O2XY12|3.0|I found it hard not to beat the levels...sometimes I like to lose so I decided to go on to something else
