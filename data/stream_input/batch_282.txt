As per the author a &quot;Benefit&quot; is one that solves a Customer's &quot;Explicit Need&quot;.<br />don't be discouraged by any review that writes off the book's  style of writing to be research oriented, the book is around 190 Pages and it's worth the weight in gold.

B00005JKZT|5.0|When I heard that this was going to be more emotional and have more themes of family and friends than Fellowship, I seriously doubted anything could top the scenes in Hobbiton. I was drastically wrong. For a good portion of the movie, I was in tears. Several times, I forgot that Treebeard and Gollum were animatronics and CG and thought they were real. The Battle at Helm's Deep had me at the edge of my seat and I tried not to cheer TOO loudly when help arrived (both times). Osgiliath was amazing and they did an excellent job showing how much the ring was effecting Frodo. I loved the scene with the Easterlings and Southrons (Oliphaunt people. I got that wrong, didn't I?). Miranda Otto was beautiful portraying Eowyn and brought her character to life. All the scenes in Edoras (make that Rohan) were captivating and I was upset that Eomer didn't have a larger role. The scene with the wargs was FANTASTIC! Showing Eowyn's concern for Aragorn and the wolves themselves were great. The opening had my jaw to the floor and the ending was PER-FECT! Some people are upset that Peter Jackson moved her to ROTK, but Sam and Frodo don't have a lot to do in ROTK, it was a better cliffhanger, more people will read the books this way, and the movie should have ended on a happy note anyway.<br />Some of the moments irked me, though. I was annoyed that Arwen had to show up, but she did sway my pity to her during one bit. Gimli was funny, but the comedy was overdone a bit. Like I said above, Eomer should have had a larger role. Faramir shouldn't have been evil (made sense in a way what they did), and I am FURIOUS over what they did to Haldir (I'm still crying about it). Mostly it was a bad thing to do because those who didn't remember him from Fellowship or hadn't even seen it, didn't get to know him that well, and this is Haldir. You just don't do that. Merry and Pippin didn't get enough time, nor did Saruman.<br />However, when you watch the movie, you'll forget everything I mentioned thatwas wrong (except Haldir, IMHTVO). This is a movie that will grab you, hold you, and won't let you go until it's over. Trust me, you'll forget about the time as you watch it. Once you see the Black Gates, the wargs, and the army at Isengard, you're theirs. Trust me. Go see it. I can't give it enough praise.

B00005UKE0|5.0|A Fantastic CD!!! The first few reviews I read about this album said this album was just \\"OK\\", but then I read the All Music Guide's rating and they gave it Five Stars so that promptly got me to buy it. There is a stellar line up:Ringo Starr, Eric Clapton, Billy Preston, etc... And pretty much all of the original album is good.. some of the bonus tracks are good, but the original album itself was superb as it was... I remember my psychologist saying this was just an ok album and she only recommended \\"My Sweet Lord\\"... \\"My Sweet Lord\\" is not my favorite song on the disc... actually \\"I Live For You\\", \\"The Ballad of Sir Frankie Crisp\\", \\"All Things Must Pass\\" and \\"Hear me Lord\\" were my favorite tunes on the disc, but pretty much the whole album was with its highlights... The original jams were a little too long, but this was just a minor setback...
B00005JL3A|3.0|I wasn't sure what to expect when \\"Resident Evil\\" fired up, so my pre-conceived notions were minimal.  I've never played the game, and thus have no bias from that viewpoint.  To summarize the movie:  Another movie where a lot of people die and then come back to life, running around and attempting to eat everyone in sight.  How many times have we seen this plot?<br />Even though the plot is a retread that we've seen more times than we can count, there are a few nifty differences.  I loved the underground train.  I know.  What is the difference between the underground train and any subway?  In this case, it's the fact that it is under a house, leading to a top secret facility.  Furthermore, the train plays an important part in the end of the movie that has some top-notch special effects.  Some of the best special effects in the movie, in fact.<br />The hive was an interesting concept that the director spent just enough time on to provide a background for the plot, without spending so much time on it that you felt like it was time to go make popcorn.  I also liked the concept that Milla Jovovich and her male partner lost their memory and regained it throughout the movie.  However, the transition from memory loss to memory gain felt a bit jerky, and wasn't covered well by the pseudo-cool flashback sequences that weren't all that well done.  The best special effect was a super cutting laser effect that plays in a couple of deaths.<br />After these cool things, the movie is basically a bunch of people running around in zombie makeup trying to kill and eat the people still living.  There were places where the director tried to infuse a modern look into the movie by the way certain shots were set up and by laying a metal rock sound track to make everything seem more impressive than it really was.  Lastly was a heavy coating of blood on everything, as though that is sufficient to cover the spots where the creativity weakened.<br />I am glad I watched the movie, which will likely be the only time I ever watch it.  Not a terrible movie, but not terribly good either.  If you are relatively new to the zombie genre, you might find this movie interesting.  If you've seen very many of this movie's predecessors, such as \\"The Night of the Living Dead\\", \\"Dawn of the Dead\\", and the numerous imitators, then this movie will be same old, same old.  Unless you are a hard-core Resident Evil video game fan, or just love a gore-fest no matter how thin the plot behind it, then perhaps this is the movie for you.  All others, rent first, buy later.kely be the only time I ever watch it.  Not a terrible movie, but not terribly good either.

0425152251|1.0|I've always been interested in philosophy, but this is just too dull. Not enough time is devoted to any one school of thought to give more than the bare bones of the ideas involved.<br />This kid instantly grasps entirely new (to her) concepts in a way no 15-year old ever would. And I wanted to slap her after a while because I was so sick of all her cute, sarcastic remarks during her lessons. Plus, how smart could she really be to not only give a strange man her address, but to tell him what times of day she would be alone?<br />When I finally decided I couldn't finish it, I looked ahead to see if the &quot;big twist&quot; I'd been anticipating all along did in fact pan out, and sure enough, there it was.
B000068PQ0|2.0|this album is decent, considering the garbage that is being released these days, but is nowhere near the innovation that made clouds taste metallic and zaireeka shine.  this music is mostly boring, uninspired, and pretentious (two or three tracks have pretty melodies, though).  its almost like a soulless imitation of the beta band and radiohead.  i am all for growth and progression, but this album just feels stiff and dull, two words i never thought i'd use to describe the flaming lips.  some of the lyrics are deep, thoughtful, and introspective, but mostly, wayne coyne is going over all his old themes about life, love, and death.  some of these lyrics, i could swear i've heard before on earlier albums.  <br />the biggest problem, though, is that this album has very little of the sense of wonder that made the flaming lips what they are.  wayne was such a genius at tapping into a child's naive curiousity about the world.  this album just doesn't have that aura and feeling.
B00005JL96|1.0|I saw the advertisments and thought this would be cute and funny.  Big mistake.  Disney is counting on their name on this one.  There is way too much violence and anger in this movie.  Lilo does not attempt to make friends with anyone in this movie, except the alien.  She even hits and bites another small child she is angry at.  She is being raised by her sister and they are watched by a social worker who threatens to take Lilo away from her because she is not taken care of.  How do you explain such problems to a small child.  Children like to mimic and act out things they see on TV, so I would not want my child screaming at me in defiance everytime I made a request of him or locking me out of the house.  Please rent this first and screen it for yourself before letting any child watch it.
B00004YW6I|5.0|This is the best PJ Harvey album since her debut, Dry.  Although critically acclaimed for previous albums, PJ is finally poised to gain the popular audience her music deserves.  These songs each contain intelligent, beautiful lyrics sung over her most melodic music to date, without losing the edge and grit that have defined her for a decade.  Escaping from the electronic flair that has touched her previous several albums, PJ is back to guitar and bass driven rock.  And she has once again demonstrated why she is the Queen.<br />Many of the songs included on Stories... conjure images of New York, and though it was written prior to 9-11, many of the songs have an eerie pertinence, conjuring images of a city that will never be the same.  At the same time, the songs display the intense personal feel that PJ is known for.  Few artists turn pain and anger into great music the way that Polly Jean does!
B000003TA4|3.0|Yeah....that's right. JUST o.k. I like tracks 1-3, 5 and the last song, Something in the Way. I'll say it, I don't really care for Nirvana, I don't think that they're the best because Cobain killed himself. In fact, I don't even enjoy Tupac! So sue me! Seriously though, this album is overhyped but good and I can see how it would have moved people away from new wave/MJackson pop groups.
B000002ITW|3.0|I recently purchased this 2 CD set after not having heard it for a number of years.  To say I was disappointed is an understatement.  For some reason, they chose to showcase less Stills than the other three members, and the overall attempt suffers greatly as a result.  I'm sorry, but Nash and Crosby have never been strong songwriters OR musicians, and are at their best when providing strong backup to Stills and Young.  Also, why in the world they chose to put a lousy 30 seconds of &quot;Suite, Judy Blue Eyes&quot; as an intro only is anybody's guess.
B000068QY7|4.0|People overlook the quality of this album as they expect great rock songs from Oasis, it's astounding they can still write great tracks and not put out a worthless album. Anyone who can appreciate rock music should own this. This isn't any better or worse than other albums, just different. Compare the attention Oasis is getting to a band like Coldplay. Coldplay is good, but Oasis shouldn't be left out just because they aren't at their 1995 popularity peak.

0688170528|4.0|Over all I really enjoyed this book. I liked it because it kept me guessing the whole time.  I liked how the author jumped from past to future for every chapter. It was an interesting effect.  I also liked the book because you have no clue what is going to happen until the last few pages.  I really enjoy love stories and suspence.  This book had both features wrapped up in it.  I would definatly read this book again, and encourage anyone thinking about reading it to do so.  I hope you enjoy it as much as iI did.
B00005JL96|5.0|Lilo &amp; Stitch is a very entertaining film. This is one of the best Disney pictures in a long time (besides maybe Monster's Inc.) It mixes many emotions to make a great movie. At first i only went to see the movie becaise Stitch is so cute. The only part some parents may not like is the fact that there are a few violentn parts. Nothing extreme but small children may not like it. I say that this is a keeper for every family.
B00006LSM3|4.0|OK ... there aren't many truely five star albums out there. Maybe Abbey Road. Born to Run. A couple of others. But this album pushes it ... maybe 4 1/2. From the opening moment asking for \\"plenty of that guitar\\", George and his co-producers (Dhani Harrison and Jeff Lynne) have produced a positively dandy piece of thought-provoking pop, which for most artists would be a blatant contradiction.<BR>The production, while reasonalby full, is much more restrained than Cloud Nine, which while excellent did make the listener think of ELO on far to regular of a basis. This is much closer to what we expect to hear from a George Harrison album, without his own tendancy to push his vocals way into the back. With a couple of minor exceptions, it suited the songs perfectly.<BR>The songs themselves are stronger than Cloud Nine, on a song for song basis, both lyrically and musically.<BR>What to compare this album to? It's much more in line with Cloud Nine than All Things Must Pass, but I almost want to compare it to Traveling Wilburys Vol. 1 ... light hearted, intelligent, warm.
B00003CXI1|5.0|After the first viewing of Harry Potter and The Sorcerer's Stone, i was simply amazed. The movie is absolutely phenomonal and viewers of any age should enjoy it.

B000065V9P|5.0|haunting, moving, eternally soothing sounds from an expert musician.<br />The songs on this work vacillate elegantly between moods. The listener is transported from states of melancholy and states of joy. Peter Gabriel's music transforms and satisfies always.
B00005JKDR|5.0|The boys from Pixar saved Disney! After some really bad movies from the Disney studios (i.e. Emperors New Groove - horrible!)comes Monsters Inc. This brilliant and also very funny movie has it all. Not only can it make you laugh but it also warms your heart as you follow Mike, the one-eyed witty small guy and his best pal James Sullivan (or Sully). After finding a human child (considered dangerous to the monster world) they become attatched to the child and need to figure out what to do with it. The storyline is smart and the animation is brilliant. This is a must have for any DVD owner.
B000067CPX|5.0|a thunderous, rhythmic wonder of an album that brings everything full circle...all the melodies, harmony and multitude of musical influences that have slipped into this ever evolving band. Too many bands are restricted by unidimensional fixes within their genre. Not these guys.<br />Some bands work so hard for so long (while remaining totally open-minded) that they truly become masters of their game. RHCP's dabble in many genres and put it all together and revamp it like no one else. They slam your soul around upside down and all around quite pleasurably.<br />Gotta love em.'

B00006HBUA|4.0|The live-action version of the popular cartoon series is just as good as any animated episode. Matthew Lillard is the most convincing Shaggy that exists in the universe and he totally plays this off to his advantage. His relationship with the computer-animated Scooby is wonderful and really makes the movie. The only real downfall to the movie (and it's a small one)is the fact that i don't really think Freddie Prinze Jr. should have been cast as Fred. I'm sorry, but Freddie Prinze Jr. and blonde hair just don't go together. Besides this one small flaw the movie is very good and i would recommend to anyone.
B00003CXBK|5.0|THE FILM: Princess Mononoke is the masterwork of a master. This is the film you would throw at people who despise Japanese animation, and make them speechless. It is by far the best animated film I have seen-- with a sweeping, tender story, breathtaking picture/animation quality, and an excellent score. The English translation/dubbing job is wonderful.<br />Aside from the sheer skill of this work, this is a movie with a soul. It's one of those rare movies that take you on a journey and leave you in a different place emotionally from when you began. The moments of wonder, horror, and awe-- the woodpecker sound of a tree spirit, the growth of plants at the hooves of the forest god, the massacre of boars, the hands of death-- will remain in your mind for a long time.<br />I don't want to overhype, so just go see it and you'll understand!<br />(As for the violence and disturbing images of this film, none of it is tasteless. It's like violence in a war film; it has to be there. It is not for small children, but small children would probably not understand this movie anyway, so it's not really an issue (note the PG-13 rating!) Also, there are plenty of pretty images to compensate; my lasting impression was that it was a beautiful film.)<br />THE DVD: It's great that you can keep with you this fascinating film, but it has practically no special features. It is a shame that none of the \\"making of the film\\" features from the Japanese DVDs have made it onto the US release.
B00005JKZ3|3.0|&quot;Men In Black&quot;, or &quot;MIB&quot; was a very good movie. It wasn't, however, a movie that i really wanted a sequel to. I only went to see it based on the fact that the first movie was so good. I left the theater very dissapointed though. The movie was EXACTLY the same as the first one. I mean the plot is even the same. Instead of training Will Smith as an agent, they're training (or re-training) Tommy Lee Jones as a agent. In the end, of course, they save the day and everything is swell. Nothing can save the plot of this movie though.
B00005IC2H|5.0|WARNING: When I write these reviews, I'm listening to the music... so if the album is happy, the review should be real happy. If the album is inspiring, the review should be inspiring. I figure this approach helps you understand the EFFECT of the music. Keep that in mind. Look for how the music has effected the review.<br />Sure, there's nothing more pretentious than making up your own language for your lyrics. If Eddie Vedder did it, Rolling Stone would have never apologized for slandering him. And rightly so, only Sigur Ros could get away with it. And that's because they have quite nearly transcended what mainstream America knows as \\"music\\". To quote one of my favorite movies:<br />\\"I'd like to think they were singing about something so beautiful, it can't be expressed in words, and makes your heart ache because of it. I tell you, those voices soared higher and farther than anybody in a gray place dares to dream.\\" - Morgan Freeman, The Shawshank Redemption<br />Sigur Ros has emerged as a band that does not work to please the ears. Oftentimes, the sound of a bow stroking the guitar is horrendous. Yet I am left dumbfounded, I keep listening. Whether the band intended it or not, my ears nearly cease hearing and my heart becomes the audience. The experience is very nearly spiritual. \\"Flugufrelsarinn\\" or \\"Svefn-G-Englar\\" wafts into my ears, stimulating an electrical charge to which my brain responds by releasing chemicals. These chemicals summon a sense of bright meloncholy, with which return all the problems I'm having in life. Yet before the song has finished, the sense of meloncholy has settled and all my problems have found their solutions. Through the seemingly magical catharsis, a peace remains which is entirely beyond description.<br />I've got a life, and when it hurts, this  brings out the tears. Something between the swirling, surreal guitars and the pained, poignant singing launches my heart into my throat. Somewhere, buried deep beneath the surface, this music has a soul. I don't mean that in the urbanized \\"got soul\\" understanding, but rather that this music truly breathes with a life of it's own...

Well, my daughter said I would not be sorry I read this book... and I wasn't.<br />If there is such a thing as writing a beautiful story about such a tragic subject Ms Sebold has accomplished it. Everyone in her story comes alive. She has combined every emotion a person would have, put it all in words and unbelievably, makes the reader shake with fear, cry with sadness, then laugh between the tears.<br />I do not understand the bad reviews above. Anyone who has, who knows, or has BEEN a child would want to read this book. It will make you think (in the event you do not) about people and maybe, just maybe, it will wake you up to the reality of it all. Sometimes we forget to be careful...after reading this book you will be careful I assure you.<br />What a wonderful writer Ms Sebold is. I only hope there will be MANY more books from her. I will be a loyal fan from this day forward.<br />A fan in Atlanta Georgia.
B00006CXXU|5.0|With Christina generally being ranked in a category with Britney, I have really been put off buying her stuff.  But this CD really is amazing.  Firstly she gives you 20 songs, which she could have easily divided up into 2 or 3 cd's instead of 1.  Secondly she shows an extreemly large range of styles, including Rock, Jazz, R&amp;B, and yes some pop.  Thirdly, it's a positive message, 'get up, stop complaining and do something with your life - I did', perhaps a little too much girl power at times but she pulls it off without having to go the Spice Girls route.  Dispite all that has been said about her, Christina has made it on pure talent, she has an amazing powerful, soulful voice.  It's an inslut to include such talent with the likes of JLo or Britney.
B0000035E7|4.0|The only reason for the 4 stars is the production is somewhat lacking, which is understandable because the band only made this cd for $400. But this is how they wanted it. This, I believe is their most personal album, the album that was before they were swallowed up in the black hole of fame and the Beast Known As MTV. It's also their most underrated (Besides Incesticide). There are MANY gems on here....such as \\"Downer,\\" \\"Big Cheese\\" (My favorite), \\"Blew\\" and \\"Love Buzz.\\"  <br />You have to get this....if you're not sure, download the songs I've listed above. You'll like it, I guarantee.
630528069X|5.0|This is a review of Die Hard 1, 2 and 3. My favorite would be DH2, but DH1 really set the mold and probably should win the award for best creativity. I prefer the winter airport and snowmobile scenes of DH2 to the city skyscraper scenes of DH1  it probably has a significant amount to do with where you grew up. Probably the same for the underground scenes of DH3, although I think DH3 was less well done from many perspectives (plot, acting, cinematography, sound). Through all of them, though, one cannot help but cheer on the good guy and be thrilled when he pulls another one off. Get all three and watch them some relaxing night.
044651652X|2.0|The story behind The Bridges of Madison County is undoubtedly a beautiful one of true love that comes too late, of loss, of fate.  But the book itself was awful.  I, personally, do not understand how it became a best seller.  The biggest problem was that Robert James Waller has no talent for dialogue.  The Bridges of Madison County is full of long monologues by various characters.  They are stiff, formal, and unrealistic, not at all the way people hold conversations.  The writing style, too, could be improved--it was very simple, very predictable, very unsophisticated.  In short, I do not think this book is worth reading.  If you're looking for a beautiful love story, try something by Anita Shreve.

B00005JKZT|5.0|My friend drug me to this movie. She has come to find out it may have been a mistake. I hadn't even read the books. But needless to say I am hooked. I have spent way to much money on the movie as well as books. I was dissappointed at a few things that were left out after reading the books. But overall I loved the movies. I can not wait untill Dec when Return of the King comes out. Jackson did an amazing job with the effects. The cast is excellent I don't know who could play the carachters any better than who they chose. I also cannot wait until the Two Towers comes out on DVD. Thanks everyone for opening my eyes to other worlds. (even if they are only in my head!)
B000003TAL|5.0|I can't describe the total grip this album had on me when I first bought. At the time I was a complete XTC fan. I got hooked on this the first time I listened to it. I was in college at the time and it  sounded like I felt. Slow  guitar intros into mindbending songs where little snippets of lyrics/truth can be made out. Little bits of truth/lyrics keep coming through the static haze of the songs. Its as if Sonic Youth were there with me on my journey peering into the darkness/abyss and describing it and guiding me. This album continues to surprise me, noone else will ever come close to this sound.   I sometimes feel the power and surge of the guitars on this album are the best ever recorded or maybe I was just high. This is Sonic Youth at full power barrelling down the highway, heading off the cliff into the abyss .... thanks for the ride. Anyway, If you are a new fan get this and Sister and Thousand Leaves.
0066214122|1.0|Michael Crichton has created a unique story based on glimmerings of emerging nanotechnology with excellent action and suspense values.<br />However, the story is fatally flawed-atleast as presented on DVD.  There is a character, referred to in the beginning of the story, which uses a single flashback approach,who we find out later is actually dead at the time.  Aside from this gaff,there are numerous logical flaws in the story that prove to be distracting from what otherwise could have been a riveting and thought-provoking story.<br />One has the feeling that the author tore through the writing of this book and that the editor did likewise, perhaps both driven by commercial pressures.  More care next time, please.

0380789035|5.0|I feel this is an excellent book, perhaps the best I read this year. Gaiman takes an outlandish idea and runs with it, and it's actually a very interesting idea--when people came to America, did their gods come with them? Where are they now? Gaiman's plot is gripping, his characters crisp, likeable and (even in their most incredible moments) believable. It's smart, it's entertaining, it's even hard to describe. I would definitely take time to read this book.<br />A word of advice, should you give American Gods a try: for maximum pleasure, trust Neil Gaiman. When a character says something that doesn't make sense, trust him. When the plot takes an odd meander away from the central storyline, trust him. If you think this book might be a little too weird for you a few chapters in, or that you're not really following everything, trust him. He doesn't spoon-feed you everything, and I think my favorite part of the book is the way you are gradually given more and more pieces of the plot, more clues to who characters are and how things will turn out in the end. Don't worry, pay attention, and enjoy. Lately I find myself rereading certain bits to see how all the details tie together in the end.<br />Since reading American Gods, I've recommended it to everyone I know. And now I'm asking YOU to trust me. It is good, honest. ;)
0316666343|5.0|This was the first selection for a book club to which I belong comprised of four other women.  We all loved the book and thus far, other selections have paled in comparison.  We all enjoyed the dynamics between Susie and her sister as well as the relationship between their parents.  Of particular interest was discussing our favorite characters.  The majority of us decided the father was our favorite.  Also interesting to discuss the mother and her relationship with her children and husband. An excellent choice for a book club and an all around great read.  One which I will definitely read again.

0312119038|5.0|I wasn't quite sure what to make of this book at first.  My exposure to nuns was quite limited as I was not raised Roman Catholic.  I always saw them as these cold, austere, soulless beings in these odd outfits on the periphery of everything.<br />Once I had completed reading, the role these women play in people's live became much more clear.  Yes, there were some truly vile women who were charged with shaping Karen (Sr. Martha) but they were doing what they believed and had been taught was necessary to create strong, obedient &quot;brides of christ&quot; as was expected of them by the church.<br />I agree with one other reviewer that there should have been more information included about what was happening in the church during those turbulent times which would have significantly aided in the readers understanding of what was happening to Ms. Armstrong.<br />I'm very glad that Ms. Armstrong discovered that her call to understand God didn't require her to be part of that hellish order and her contributions to religeon have done more than anything those probably long forgotten superiors of hers have ever added to human understanding.<br />There's also another book I'd recommend if you can find it &quot;Behold The Women&quot; which has many wonderful essays from women who were part of various religeous orders.  It also has a large number of pictures of many orders some of which leave you wondering &quot;...who in their right mind would want to wear something like this for the rest of their lives?&quot;.
0066214122|4.0|Crichton introduces his cautionary tale of technology run amok with a fairly dire summation of human shortsightedness. \\"The total system we call the biosphere is so complicated that we cannot know in advance the consequences of anything that we do.\\" Add greed and arrogance to ignorance and technology and you have the basic ingredients for one of Crichton's page-turning plots. \\"Unfortunately, our species has demonstrated a striking lack of caution in the past. It is hard to imagine that we will behave differently in the future.\\"<br />The story itself gets off to a liesurely start. A brief preface begins at the end - the kids sick, people dead, a world of scary uncertainty. The narrator, Jack Forman, reflects: \\"Sitting here in the dark, it's hard to believe that a week ago my biggest problem was finding a job. It seems almost laughable now.\\" The novel then drops back to that week ago, to Forman's increasingly satisfying routine as a stay-at-home dad, refereeing arguments between his pre-teen daughter and son, changing the baby, getting everyone fed and clothed and ferried. Months before, Forman had lost his job as a computer programming manager as a result of trying to do the right thing - now he finds himself blackballed all over Silicon Valley.<br />But his wife, Julia, has a good job at Xymos, a nanotechnology company on the verge of a breakthrough.  The company, she tells Jack, has had a stunning success. It has broken the nanotechnology manufacturing barrier and is producing a sub-microscopic camera, which can roam the human blood stream, with obviously spectacular medical implications. Crichton delivers a bit of technical data, explaining some of the stumbling blocks to successful nanotechnology, information delivered painlessly between Julia's increasingly irritable moods, and Jack's growing conviction that there's more than workaday tension behind her erratic behavior. He suspects an affair.<br />But before he can confront Julia, their baby daughter breaks out in a mysterious, painful, posibly life-threatening rash, which baffles the emergency-room doctors and then disappears as suddenly as it arrived. The pace begins to pick up. Strange events - a broken MP-3 player, out of place items in the baby's room, sightings of imaginary people - charge the atmosphere as Julia grows ever more hard and beautiful.<br />Then Jack is called in to consult at Xymos. Apparently it's one of his artificial intelligence programs, PREDPREY, \\"a goal-seeking program based on predator/prey dynamics\\" that Xymos is using to control their real nanotech project - self-guiding micro-cameras for the military - and they are having problems keeping the goal steady. Jack is uncertain, but after his wife has a car accident, he takes the job. Now the pace goes into overdrive.<br />There's been contamination, leakage from the plant resulting in some dead animals. The project manager, an old prot&eacute;g&eacute; of Jack's, is evasive, even deliberately misleading. But it's not giving anything away (the jacket copy does that) to say that the project itself has escaped human control and is evolving rapidly, according to the basic parameters of its predator/prey programming, but with lots of rapid and unforseen innovations. Humans have become the prey.<br />Can Jack stop the proliferating nano-clouds before they change the world?<br />Crichton (\\"Jurassic Park,\\" \\"Congo,\\" \\"The Terminal Man\\")mixes in the science effortlessly, giving his readers some fairly complex lessons without slowing the action. He's less successful with characters, though, and it's hard to believe Jack's motivations at times - refusing the consulting job, despite his suspicions and then abruptly taking it after his wife's accident - yes, there was an odd van that showed up at the scene and yes, maybe there was someone else in the car, but his wife's condition is critical and what about the kids? There are worse crimes though - Jack, the seasoned project manager, heading out on a mission ofextreme danger and not bothering to organize the equipment they will need or even make sure someone else has done it. But these are minor quibbles and nothing you won't find in any Crichton novel. Crichton's strength is ideas and action and there's plenty of both in this one.ger and not bothering to organize the equipment they will need or even make sure someone else has done it.

B00005YW4H|5.0|Norah Jones brings back the music of the past to a new generation that has truly embraced her. Her CD is filled with heart warming music as well as some deep and powerful lyrics. Truely a best seller.. her songs such as &quot;Come away with me&quot; and &quot;Painter&quot; song have heart felt lyrics of confusion and of longing as well as just a great musical score. Her voice is sultry and soothing and reminds me of past singers of the blues and jazz.I must say she is one of the best and I think she will be around for a long time.
078322608X|4.0|With the dream sequences and sudden time shifts, the start of this movie is quite confusing.  The story and the characters are engaging.  It's funny and well worth watching.
B00005JLSC|5.0|For fans of the movie musical, and everyone else for that matter, this movie is a gift!  Featuring most of the sensational Kander-Ebb numbers from the Fosse Broadway show, but presented with the fresh imagination of director Ronb Marshall, this movie is non-stop, gleefully sinful fun.  And the performers really shine, most of all Renee Zellwegger, who is a brilliant choice to play Roxie Hart.  Catherine Zeta-Jones literally slithers across the screen, and who knew Richard Gere was such a terrific tap dancer?  Concerned much more with fame and the spotlight than with the means it takes to gets there, this movie's heroines have more than a small chip on their shoulder; they are basically a collection of killers.  You will find it hard not to applaud each and every number; the music is infectious, non-stop and expertly arranged and performed.  Chica-GO!
B00003CXI0|4.0|The movie sticks very closely to the facts and details of the book with few deviations.  However, the book is much funnier.  Kids will probably still enjoy the movie if they've read the book.   The dvd also includes games.

B00004RF97|4.0|The film is, of course, wonderful.  What you probably want to know is that the DVD is a nice clean transfer with great contrast.

0792838084|4.0|Lynch subverts the logical paradigm in high style with a lovely piece of neon noise starring the LOVELY Isaballa Rosellini. It is a beautiful mish mash of colliding worlds where no normal reconcilliation can be found. Crazy people doing CRAZY things behind every door, under every floor, where sanity is a sign of weakness, and love an article of trade. Not so much shocking as stimulating, not so much viscious as visceral... worth watching.
B00005OWEH|3.0|Coppolla's 'masterpiece' was a dubious and over-long project to begin with, but three and a half hours is tearing the arse out of it. I'm not at all sure that the 'bonus material' has helped matters. The ill-judged inclusion of the French plantation scene only adds to the sense of a film without structure or direction and will leave you glancing at your watch every five minutes. This newly cut edition will probably be a delight for absolute fans of the film, but more mainstream audiences may find it draining - not the best advertisement for any movie.
B000066NW0|1.0|Avril is nothing but Brittany Spears dressed in ties and black.  Her music, her fame - it is all image, and no talent or truth.  Lyric-wise, the album boasts lymrics conjured by a competant fourteen year-old songwriter (a guess on my part); anyone that has bothered to read the linear notes knows that Avril did not write the lyrics herself.  Frankly, I think she might have done a better job.<br />Catchy-tunes about tough life in a tough neighborhood might be meaningful if Avril had actually grown up in a tough neighborhood, rather than as a privalged child in a suburban town.  In an alternate universe, fans might relate to &quot;Sk8er Boi&quot;; in this universe, it's cool to be a skateboarder, and it's even cooler if you're in a band, are good-looking, and have a semi-tolerable personality.<br />Musicly, this album is not bad.  That is, if you're not expecting anything more than the next pop sensation.  Avril is not /completely/ devoid of musical talent - nor are her bandmates.  Unfortunately, upbeat pop tunes and uninspired, typical musicianship does not cut it in my book.<br />This is not punk.  If you are looking for punk, do not buy this.  You probably already know that if you are somewhat familiar with punk rock.  This is not rock. <br />This is POP.  If you are a fan of Avril's songs on the radio, this is a wise purchase.  All of the other songs sound the same.  Looking to blow your money on the newest pop sensation and finally find a reason to throw out your Brittany Spears albums? Buy two of these.

0688170528|4.0|This is a story with heart, love, character and suspense.  The Pact is a story with many different views and many different turns.

Emily Gold and Chris Harte are two teenagers that have known each other before they were born.  Both their mothers stay at home moms and their fathers both doctors.  They were meant to have everlasting love.  Always playing together when they were children, Emily and Chris' relationship took a turn for the worst when Emily found out she was pregnant.  Emily knew she couldn't tell Chris she was pregnant and the only solution she thought of was suicide.  They had a Pact, which was to commit suicide together so nothing would be questioned.

Melanie Gold (Emily's mother) didn't want to help out Chris or the Hartes in any way.  With her daughter dead and Chris in jail for murder, she knew he had planned to do it, once he found out Emily was pregnant. While Chris is fighting for his life against the state, he feels the only one that really loved his was Emily and she isn't even there to help him through it.  This compelling story is not only a book but also a shock as to the realization of teenage couples of today's world.
0679735909|5.0|Possession is a challenging, multilayered novel that takes patience and concentration but is well worth the effort. On the cover it is labelled \\"a romance.\\" This is a possibly  ironic simplification of all this epic novel encompasses. It is actually about the confrontation of two very different worlds: the romanticism of 19th Century poets and the postmodern detachment of late 20th Century scholars. On the other hand, A.S. Byatt also suggests that these two worlds may not be so far apart or irreconcilable as it first appears. Roland Mitchell is a graduate student doing research on a famous poet named Randolph Ash. Roland is an indecisive, introverted scholar whose future is uncertain. He is unsatisfied with his career; his own inertia keeps him in an apparently futile relationship; he feels his own identity is vague and somehow secondary to the poet he is studying. His life is suddenly infused with purpose when he finds an unfinished letter written by Ash to an unknown woman. He soon learns that this letter was intended for Christabel La Motte, a reclusive poet who had not previously been associated with Ash. Roland teams up with another scholar, Maud Bailey, who is an expert on La Motte (and a distant relation as well). They come upon a whole collection of letters between La Motte and Ash and find themselves in the middle of a fierce battle with fellow scholars who also want possession of these letters. The parallel between the two 19th Century poets and the two 20th Century scholars is the main theme, but it is really the letters, which include many poems and tales of faeries and magical worlds that are the heart of the novel. Modern notions of scholarship, literary criticism, feminism and sexuality are all thoroughly explored. Possession asks whether it is either moral or useful to \\"deconstruct\\" literary works (and their authors' lives). Do the dead have a right to privacy? Does modern scholarship, as it dissects and analyzes, destroy rather than illuminate (an undoubtedly symbolic subplot has Ash dissecting insects and other living things)? I found these questions more interesting than the interaction between the two living scholars. Here we have the familiar (especially in English literature) situation of two people attracted to each other who find it almost impossible to reach beyond their own self-imposed solitude. Their inhibitions, reinforced by the stifling atmosphere of academia, is a significant part of the story, but it was sometimes a little exasperating all the same. The portrayal of intellectuals as envious and conniving competitors at times borders on parody. Byatt lampoons two American scholars with particular zeal. The modern characters' main function is to connect the many threads of this vast novel. What is perhaps most interesting is the way the process of literary deconstruction is turned in on itself. After observing 19th Century romantics through the lens of a contemporary mindset, these modern tools (and those who wield them) are themselves ruthlessly scrutinized. I listened to the audiobook, read flawlessly by Virginia Leishman and plan to read the print version soon to absorb more of the novel's many subtleties.ndoubtedly symbolic subplot has Ash dissecting insects and other living things)?

0790734850|5.0|Until this film hit the silver screen, James Ellroy's books were famously (and quite understandably) considered to be unfilmable: they're so epic in scope and byzantine in plot they would make filming a Tolkien trilogy seem like a doddle.<br />But records and rules were made to be broken, and this film version of Ellroy's LA Confidential shatters that conventional wisdom and brings Ellroy's vision vivdly to the screen.<br />It's a top-notch cast into the bargain; while headlines may go to Bassinger as femme fatale, Pearce and Crowe and rookie cops at the centre of the maelstrom, make sure you keep an eye on the surrounding cast - to my mind this is really what gives the film its zip and zing. James Cromwell - yes, the kindly farmer from Babe - avoids the danger of being typecast in that role, to say the least, as a truly dastardly police commander; Kevin Spacey is all satin and schwing as the smooth-talking celebrity cop Jack Vincennes, but crowning the whole shooting match (a term I use deliberately), and more than anything infusing the movie with Ellroy's hipster '50s attitude and credibility is none other than Danny de Vito, having the time of his life as the editor of Hush Hush Magazine.<br />This is a really, really slick show, from beginning to end. Where Curtis Hanson has been especially canny is in paring down some of the excesses of Ellroy's plotting (it has always struck me as odd that a writer with such a deliberately sparse, stacatto, writing style gets so carried away with his plots) so as not to tax credulity or the \\"Oh Come On\\" factor, and has landed up with a tense, riveting, brutal, but at the same time knowing and witty, thriller.<br />This is a must for any fan of modern cinema.

B00006690G|4.0|'The Eminem Show' is an album with a few stinkers and a good amount of truly memorable masterpiece tracks that more than make up for the woman-hating songs that we tend to skip.<br />As we all know 'Cleaning out my Closet' and 'Without Me' are fantastic songs but there are a few other single-worthy songs on here, by golly.  'Hailie's Song' is just gorgeous and sweet, with a bit of wife-hating thrown in to remind us who we're listening to, 'White America' is like budder, 'Say Goodbye to Hollywood' is just catchy and ace, 'Square Dance' is yet another gem and... the list goes on.<br />Eminem has a lot to say and I like to really listen to the words and try to understand not only his feelings, but the feelings of, at least one part of, an entire generation.  It is fantastic to see someone get out there and not be afraid to be controversial, whether it's right or wrong.  He's going to tell us what he thinks and if you've got a problem with that, then [too bad]!  So refreshing these days.<br />Without going overboard, I would have to say Eminem is a poet for our times, an extremely talented lyricist, and like most... geniuses (?) of our time, will not be truly appreciated until after he's dead and gone.
B000002VC5|4.0|&quot;I Robot&quot; is probably most people's favorite by Alan Parsons.  I recognize it as one of his best although it isn't my favorite.  A great song like &quot;The Voice&quot; is one I'll never be able to figure out. Why does it have the disco sound in the middle?  And I never could understand the point of a song like &quot;Nucleus&quot; or &quot;Total Eclipse&quot; with its piercing sounds.  &quot;Total Eclipse&quot; would have probably been better on &quot;Tales of Mystery...&quot; although I could live without it altogether.  In my opinion about half of the tracks are good compostions and it's a CD worth getting, especially if you're into Parsons.  Songs like &quot;I Robot&quot;, &quot;Some Other Time&quot;, &quot;Breakdown&quot; and &quot;Day After Day&quot; are standouts, with the instrumental &quot;I Robot&quot; being somewhat of a residue from &quot;Tales of Mystery...&quot; .  If you were listening to this album back in '77 and '78 I'm sure hearing it now is bound to bring back memories like the one I have of taking a day off work in the fall of '78, putting this album on early in the morning and standing on a third floor balcony with the sliding glass door open and listening to &quot;Some Other Time&quot; over and over again.
B000002552|5.0|How would it feel for any artist to be told that his best work, his most profound statement, his most mysteriously compelling, enduring, penetrating and memorable compositions, the stuff that people write whole BOOKS about are a bunch of throw away sketches that he never intended to show anyone?  It would drive me nuts!  Here I work to craft real albums and spend real money to record them with great sound quality and the public wants this garbage that I literally threw together in my spare time.  It boggles the mind!<br />Poor Bob.  But I'll tell you what; I put the Basement Tapes among the greatest rock albums of all time, right up there with the Who's Next, the Beatles White album and The Dark Side of the Moon.  Yes but why?  Why, why, why? <br />It's hard to put my finger on but the answer lies in the mood that these recordings create, a feeling that few if any modern day city folk or automobile enslaved rurals get to feel anymore.  Picture no TV, no canned music, no supermalls.  Nothing to do but get with the boys to sit around the stove at the General Store, drink whiskey and spit tobaccy juice.  These songs seem to come from an age when people had to make their own entertainment, create their own fun.  And when you entertain yourselves it's much more entertaining than all the CDs at Amazon.com.  I haven't felt that way since I was a kid and I miss it.  <br />That's the feeling that these home made practice sessions evoke for me.  That's what makes the Basement Tapes a work of art that really speaks to people accustomed to road rage and computer crashes.  Get the Columbia five CD set when it comes out... If Bob ever gets around to it.
B000001FN3|5.0|&quot;A Dream Within a Dream&quot;, one of many thought provoking poems by Poe is probably the best song on this album, too bad it isn't longer.  Parsons early albums seemed to have a flair for the dramatic.  Whether you heard this album for the first time 26 years ago or yesterday it is something like you have never heard before.  Although songs like &quot;The fall of the House of Usher&quot; can become tediously repetitious (referring to &quot;IV Pavane&quot;) the album in its entirety is brilliant.  The vocals are somewhat coarse, but then again maybe they were meant to be due to the subject.  The CD is not quite the same as the original album so if you liked the original don't give it away.  Remember the &quot;Crazy World&quot; of Arthur Brown and the song &quot;Fire&quot;?  Well, Arthur sings &quot;The Tell-tale Heart&quot;, a gruesome trip into the macabre.  I do wish the CD was the same as the original recording.  Orson Welles voice and ramblings are something I could live without, &quot;music is simply music&quot; (???).  Another thing I noticed about this CD is that when &quot;The Cask of Amontillado&quot; is ending and merging into the intro of &quot;(The System of) Doctor Tarr and Professor Fether&quot; where you can hear a party and revelry going on you hear a cork popping on a wine bottle on the original where in the CD this sound effect is left out.  If all you've ever heard from this album is &quot;The Raven&quot; don't judge it by that one song.  In my opinion all the others are as good or better.  If you're like me and you bought the album long ago you listened to &quot;A Dream within a Dream&quot; so many times that this track developed a fair amount of static.  That's one good thing about getting the CD even though you do have to stomach Orson Welles introduction.

It's  because, like good lighting in a department store, it makes everytyhing else SEEM BETTER. <br />Great suggestions for EVALUATING usability.  How else will you know if you're actually done it right?<br />PROGRAMMERS:  This book is also applicable to user-interface design.
B000002VCO|4.0|\\"Prime Time\\", \\"Dancing on a Highwire\\", \\"Since the Last Goodbye\\" and \\"You Don't Believe\\" are my favorites. \\"Pipeline\\" is a beautiful instrumental although admittedly, a bit repetitious. This was the last Parsons/Woolfson album I really liked a lot.  Stereotomy sounds good though. But look at what came after: \\"Vulture Culture\\" (hardly a groundbreaking record) and \\"Gaudi\\", which is good, but seems way off course from where it all began. Songs on this album may be more radio friendly than the concept albums of the beginning and that may be the direction Parsons and Woolfson decided they needed to go, after all, you can't make beautiful music without money. \\"You Don't Believe\\" is another good song on this album.
B000001OAA|5.0|Amazing album!  My favourite tracks are Only happy when it rains, A stroke of luck, my lover's  box and milk.  An album filled with doom and gloom, great to dance in the dark to!  There are beautiful sad songs, eerie songs, sarcastic funny songs and empowering songs.  Shirley Manson's voice gives you chills.  There are so many cool sounds and original ideas on this album.  A great album to drive to or to get you energized, but also good for listening to in the dark in your bed. It's my favourite album because it gives me a lot  of comfort!
B000002VC3|4.0|What an awesome beginning to an album.  If only the rest of it compared to the opening song, \\"Sirius\\".  There are still many good songs here.  \\"Psychobabble\\" is one and all are listenable.  \\"Eye in the Sky\\" practically got played to death.   I have to say that I don't think this album compares to Parsons first three but it is difficult to come out with one masterpiece after another.  Portions of this album compare to Parsons great early works.  It is definitely good music, even though many of the songs are on the \\"soft\\" side.  For first time Parsons listeners I wouldn't recommend it although I think for some it would be a good place to start and probably was for many because of this album's incredibly dramatic introduction.

B000002VCB|3.0|Frankly, I wish Parsons and Woolfson had done some other kind of concept album.  After the first three I heard this one in '79 and was disappointed.  A lot of the songs sound good and I got to where I liked them.  &quot;You won't be there&quot; is a good one and &quot;If I could change your mind&quot;.  Was this album their rebuttal in the face of rejection or what?  Anyway, I finally realized that this album was just &quot;different&quot; than the first three and it gradually &quot;grew&quot; on me.  However, I hardly ever listen to this CD now.  I was getting into Parsons &quot;other place and time&quot; kind of sound.  When I heard this everything crashed back to harsh reality.  Actually I would give this album a higher rating but somehow it seemed out of order.  There are good songs on this album though, don't pass it up if you're a Parsons/Woolfson fan.  Its got &quot;Vulture Culture&quot; beat bad, that's for sure.
6305558167|4.0|&quot;Excalibur&quot; is a remarkable film in nearly every way; Monty Python fans will find a veritable plethora of familiar material from &quot;The Holy Grail,&quot; fantasy fans will enjoy the beautiful scenery, costumes, and courtly love, and action-oriented people will love the battle sequences. <br />The star of the show? Without a doubt, Nicol Williamson as Merlin. He gets so completely into his role, without a care for how others may perceive him. He has moments of brilliant drama, a whole bunch of subtle (and not-so-subtle) humor, and a great sense of timing. Nigel Terry plays an unbelievably goofy young Arthur, but then radically switches gears as Arthur matures and is equally convincing as both. The rest of the cast are good, but not oustanding. Liam Neeson is surprisingly goofy in his role as Gawain.<br />Now then - to the heart of it. True Arthurian legend scholars will no doubt be irked by the treatment of the story; I was. However, that did not lesson my enjoyment of the film in the slightest. It is an epic, sweeping tale of love, betrayal, magic, mystery, heroism, knights, maidens, battles, kingdoms and realms, all woven together under John Boorman's expert touch. The tale of King Arthur and Camelot strikes a very resonant chord within many of us, and we crave vicarious experiences of those simpler, nobler times. &quot;Excalibur&quot; offers a brief glimpse into how it may have been. Some of the dialogue and acting does venture into the gratuitously melodramatic, but if you enjoy a little camp in your films, this will only add to your appreciation of &quot;Excalibur.&quot;<br />I wholeheartedly love this movie, despite the fact that it's not the best of films ever made, and perhaps not even the best Arthurian film ever created. But it's darned good, it sweeps viewers up into itself and carries us away. What more can we ask from a film of this type? Wonderful stuff.
6301790170|5.0|The title is misleading and probably one of the reasons it didn't do well at the box office.  People may have been expecting another grossout like \\"The Exorcist\\".  The only thing these two shows have in common is the same director.  This movie tells the story of four men who have escaped imminent danger in their own country and fled to a jungle hell in South America.  Still, this beats the alternative.  They are all in big trouble and are facing prison or death.  Their escape is to a place where no one wants to look for them.  This place of exile is nearly as bad as what they ran away from though.  There is nothing to do but sweat and live in squalor.  They get a chance to make enough money to escape this hell but it is a dangerous drive through the jungle on poorly maintained roads to say the least.  They are carrying nitro and have to travel something like 200 miles to reach their destination.  But these are desperate men willing to gamble with their lives because their lives have become hopeless anyway.  The soundtrack by Tangerine Dream is as intense as the movie.  And don't miss the last song, \\"Betrayal (Sorcerer Theme)\\".  This song alone makes the soundtrack worth buying.
B00006CXXU|5.0|I have to say...I was skeptical about this CD but after reading other people's recommedations, I bought it....and it's Awesome!!  This woman has the most incredible voice...and the songs are great.  I was never a Christina fan, but I am now.
B000002VCU|4.0|When I got this album in late 1980 it didn't seem like a concept album about gambling.  Maybe side 2 but not side 1.  Although side 2 is good I got hooked on side 1.  This album seemed to fit with my life at the time, that's why I liked it.  But for an objective listener a &quot;4&quot; rating I would say is generous.  Songs like &quot;May be a Price to Pay&quot;, &quot;Games People Play&quot;, &quot;Time&quot; and &quot;I Don't wanna go home&quot; are catchy tunes that are enjoyable to listen to over and over again in the beginning.  But once you're tired of them you may never care to listen to them again, ever.  This is a half concept album in my opinion.  I don't see much correlation to gambling in the first few songs but don't have a problem with that because I like them more.  &quot;Games People Play&quot; starts out with, &quot;Where do we go from here now that all of the children are growing up&quot; may be in reference to baby boomers and/or their parents but that's my opinion.  Once again, these songs are catchy, but I don't think it's a Parson's CD you'll enjoy years later like some of his others.  I feel like it went with the time though (late 1980, early 1981).  So, if you want to get nostalgic, it's a good listen.
0767830555|5.0|Watching Scorsese's unfailingly great \\"Taxi Driver\\" this weekend, I saw it as a haunting portrayal of a misled psychotic, who goes on a killing spree not to free the 12-year-old hooker from pimps but because he has his own misguided view of everything that's wrong with the world's morality.<br />That he's seen as a hero at the end of the film is a joke, a mistake made by people who think he did what he did to save Iris. Travis wasn't interested, I think, in saving Iris. He was just insane and didn't see Iris as one of the filth of humanity. He saw her as salvageable. He didn't go on the killing spree for her benefit, but her freedom was a lucky byproduct to Travis' madness.<br />This isn't \\"Death Wish\\"-type vengeance. Travis is insane, a villain who doesn't understand the depths of his own madness. While dating political volunteer Betsy, he's so unclear on how to go about it that he takes her to a dirty movie, buys her an album she already owns, then stalks her. He writes a manifesto about the evils of society. He's a war veteran, living an isolated life away from his parents. He's unable to sleep. He sees the world as a sick place, where he's the only normal man left. He's not a hero. He's not a tough guy. He's a basket case.<br />Notice how little dialogue he actually has with Iris, played incredibly by Jodie Foster, before deciding to \\"save\\" her from Sport. Iris doesn't even want him to do it. Who she is doesn't matter to Travis. What she represents matters more to Travis. He's embarking on a rampage, intending to kill lots of people (including the presidential candidate in a thwarted attempt), yet he only succeeds in killing the pimps.<br />He's not a hero, but society, in one of the film's best twists, makes him a little girl's savior. Betsy, at the end, forgives him without knowing the extent of his madness, and he smiles at her.<br />Then, he keeps driving, thinking, plotting.<br />This is a great, extremely bleak movie. And DeNiro's performance is pitch perfect.fect.
0316666343|2.0|After hearing several peers talk about this book, I had to read it. After reading the beginning of the book, I couldn't believe this was suggested to me, but as I continued I realized why. The point-of-view from which the book is told grasped and kept my attention. I was intrigued about the characters and their various reactions to the crime. It was told from an intersting persepective and included all spectrums of emotion. At times, as I frantically turned the pages, hooked on each word, I wanted to cry. At other times, I was laughing out loud. <br />I was very disappointed in the ending. The author did a poor job of bringing closure to the events which she creatively put into my head. The most far-fecthed reading I have encountered was the Ruth-Suzie-Ray incident. Also disappointing was the manner in which the killer was himself killed.<br />More could have been done with the ending of this book to keep me a fan of Sebold. As for now, she is not a favorite. More explaination and development of characters is needed.
B00003CXWV|2.0|Johnny Depp gives an interesting performance as George Jung in \\"Blow,\\" but I didn't like this film, nor did I understand its points. Was I supposed to care for Jung? His actions brought about the deaths of thousands and ushered in the current state of drugs in America. He lived in decadence by helping others ruin their lives. He lost his money, and he kept making mistakes, getting involved with drug trade when he should've gotten out of it.<br />The film seems, to me, to want you to sympathize with Jung, yet, as a viewer, you cannot. He is not a hero.<br />When he loses his daughter in the end, it's not sad. It's fitting.<br />Ted Demme, who died one year after directing this, created an interesting film, but it's one that seems to make a hero out of a man who doesn't fit the mold.
0192833383|3.0|Still speaking to us across the ages is Collins' archtypal detective story, the lengthly tale of a stolen diamond  consisting of no less than eight major narratives. While Collins' meticulously plotted mystery is most famous for its complex construction and detailed detective work, its &quot;solution&quot; has aged so appallingly that it is really the narrative voices that most appeal to the modern reader.<br />It's problematic then, that the most interesting narrators, butler extraordinaire Gabriel Betteredge and wonderously mortifying spinster Miss Clack speak first, while the endless wrap-up is given over to tediously forthright hero Franklin Blake. Things perk up at the end as poignant Ezra Jennings briefly takes over, but Blake quickly dispatches him and continues with his own colorless narration.<br />Considering its advanced age, the first half of this book works surprisingly well, but the latter sections sag badly. For those interested in the period or genre, The Moonstone is a fascinating relic, but not quite a fully functioning mystery.
B00003CXAA|5.0|I watched the entire DVD set of \\"The Godfather\\" trilogy over a long weekend, and it made for one of the most engrossing, entertaining times I've spent at home alone.<br />The first two films, certainly, are the greatest of the series. The third is lacking, but not a disaster, and serves as a fitting conclusion to the story, for the most part.<br />What the films have, though, is one of the greatest ensemble casts ever assembled. Brando, Pacino, Cazale, Caan, Duvall, Keaton and De Niro come together in the epic story of the violent rise and the epic, disturbing downfall of the Corleone family.<br />Though the third film, in which the tragedy of Mary's death is downplayed somewhat by Sofia Coppola's inept performance (if only Winona Ryder hadn't had that nervous breakdown and created an emotional, compelling Mary that we could've actually cared for...), is a disappointment, the overall story is a grand one.<br />The extras on the DVD are welcome, particularly the documentary detailing the behind-the-scenes troubles on the first and second films. Coppola, on the commentary, comes off as a bit of an egomaniac, but that bravado of his is wholly earned.<br />This is a must-have for any collector.

0375805613|5.0|I wandered into the room of my best friend's three-year-old son, preparing to read him a book before he went to bed. When I saw this book among the pile on his floor, I got nostalgic. Really nostalgic. My mom read me the same book when I was his age, and I love, LOVE this book.<br />Not only does it teach you that sometimes the answer to all of your questions is right in front of you, but it does so by giving you pages of Grover, one of the most hysterical, lovable Muppets. The rattling of Grover's nerves, and the actual building of suspense in a picture book, keep the reader turning the book's pages -- even though Grover BEGS you not to do so. The reader is actually included in the narrative, for the book involves only Grover talking to the reader. The book thus becomes involving very quickly and entertaining throughout it.<br />Plus, the final punchline is a great payoff.<br />If you have children, this is an absolute must. Unlike other books from children's shows, this one's intelligent, maintains proper values and isn't beat-me-over-the-head annoying.
006016848X|5.0|Fact is ladies don't get it, which is similar to the otehr book I recommend WHAT'S WRONG WITH BLACK WOMEN? by Monte Maddox. Anything someone goes negatiove against women, oh boy! Watch out! I love both of this texts, as they delve into areas that many of us (including women) do not want to deal with! BRAVO!
B00005JLSC|5.0|I went to see Chicago in the Ziegfried Theatre last saturday.  The line was around the block and I thought, this better be worth it.<br />It absolutely was! I felt like I was sitting in a theatre with live performances.  I have not seen the actual play on Broadway and hoped this didn't ruin my wanting to eventually see it on Broadway.  This movie only whetted my appetite to see it live.<br />Renee was phenomenal as was Catherine Zeta Jones.  They were lively, funny and had really strong voices. Richard Gere never ceases to amaze me. I was so impressed with his performance I forgave him for  The Mothman Prophecies. As alway my girl Latifah was a strong supporting character.<br />Everytime they did a musical number I thought, \\"okay this is my favorite,\\" only to find that I enjoyed the next one even more. You really felt like you were watching them on Broadway.<br />The theatre was packed and when all was said and done people were applauding as if there were live people on the stage, it made you feel that excited about seeing a movie.<br />I won't go into details and give things away but the Cell Block Tango was one of the highlights and made me want to kill a man just so I could sing about it.....<br />Anyway go see this movie. It is worth the lines and the waiting.  You will want to dance out the theatre when it is over.

B00005V3Z4|5.0|'Donnie Darko' is one of those movies that I know I will return to, to view again and again. It's a low-tech visual feast with the most outstanding screenplay this side of \\"The Pledge\\" _and_ it's a perfect evocation of 80's culture. Those of you who experienced the 80's firsthand with find that the soundtrack music, current events and social values all ring true to the times. It's a brilliant sci-fi/black comedy that works on many different levels. Don't miss it if you care about great films.
B00006RU5B|3.0|Rage fans, this album will probably disappoint you.  Now we see all too well that the fiery vocal talents of Zach de la Rocha combined with Tom Morello's innovative stylings of  the guitar were nothing short of genius.  This is such a disappointing effort from such a brilliant rocker (Morello) and amazing vocalist (Cornell).  Missing from this album are musical or political relevance.  What is left on the album is diluted, confused, pseudo grunge-era metal and watered-down Rage remnants.  Unfortunately, it just does NOT rock hard enough.  So very sad from two bands that delivered so much raw power and meaning to music in the last decade....
B000063K2W|4.0|What happens when you take the men away and just watch a bunch of women gabbing it up? They talk about men, of course! Not a single male of the species appears in this George Cukor comedy, but during their absence every member of the female cast manages to find trouble with one of them. Norma Shearer plays a high-society wife who is devastated when she learns that her husband is leaving her for a perfume salesgirl (Joan Crawford), with whom he has been carrying an affair for a very long time. Rosalind Russell is hysterical as the good friend who appears just in time to deliver the best cut-ups to both parties. This one-liner-laden adaptation of the famous Claire Booth Luce play also features a great cross-country adventure involving Shearer's trip to Reno to get her divorce, where she meets a colourful collection of divorcees worth writing home about, plus a fashion show filmed in full Technicolour.
B000001EHS|5.0|Many good songs on this album; I can't think of one song I didn't like. If you're a Def Leppard fan, and you don't have this album- well, you're a fool.
0790729970|5.0|I like this film, and I like Jim Carrey. I like energetic performances, especially when coupled with a clever idea. A lot of people don't like Jim Carrey. Maybe they just don't understand. He was manic, crazy and totally in touch with the parody/satire in \\"Ace Ventura\\". In \\"The Mask\\", he creates a character that is totally his own. Certainly, there are silly moments, but there are also soft and sweet moments, as well as clever crazy moments. The effects are great, and Carrey must've had a great time incorporating them into his performance, a driven performance with center and conviction. There's a great performace by the dog who played Milo. This is a good dog. Often animals are used in film to be cute; Milo transcended this stereotype. One of the finest features of \\"The Mask\\", is the debut of Cameron Diaz, here playing a gorgeous vamp (to perfection). Ms. Diaz has subsequently been given a bad rap; I'm particularly referring to her performance in \\"Being John Malkovich\\", in which she was definitely not gorgeous, but consumed the role she played. Another example of the Hollywood heirarchy not taking gorgeous women for their innate talent. I admire Cameron Diaz as an actress, and watching this again confirms this. Unfortunately, I got this DVD when I bought my player, and it has subtitles that I can't get rid of. I have no problem with subtitles for foreign films. Don't be misled. Enjoy, kick back and let the fantasy take you away! It's SO much fun! I also think Carrey was brilliant in \\"The Truman Show\\", but, I guess, if you like films like \\"The Mask\\", your opinion doesn't count. I loved it!
B00005JLS0|3.0|This movie was ok but this exact set up was used at least twice just this year alone! A wealthy/powerful man and a maid/subordinate at first they fight and then they realize that they love each other. This was used almost identicatlly in Blue Crush and in Maid in Manhattan. I'm giving it 3 stars for lack of originality.
B000002MU3|2.0|Following the commercial and artistic success of Automatic For the People, REM decided not to take the next natural step, but instead leap for a completely different set of stairs...and miss.<br />REM's goal was three-fold: to become a band again (Automatic featured only a handful of tracks with the band playing togather), to have a set of songs suitable for touring arenas, and to show the world that they weren't only acoustic singer-songwriters, but the figureheads of alternative rock.<br />The plan backfired.  The overall effect didn't get the public saying, &quot;Wow, I didn't see that coming!  These guys are artists!  They follow their muse!&quot;; instead, it revealed REM as craftsmen.  Like a fashion victim who says, &quot;Hey, let's go to the party tonight dresed in western outfits, tomorrow night we can try the Sufi look&quot;, it was clear that REM sat down, said, &quot;Let's hang up our suits and ties and change our image.  I'll shave my head and look all skater-punk; Mike, you start wearing some cool glittery outfits; Pete, howzabout some mutton chops and some loud guitars, no mandolins; and Bill...uh...you keep being you.&quot;<br />This carried over into the music.  The acoustic guitars - and, in large measure, the textures - were lost and replaced by loud, (overly) agressive guitars and four-chord bashers - influenced by the likes of My Bloody Valentine, Nirvana, and legends the New York Dolls - with intriguing but inconsequential lyrics.  Plus, again, the band hadn't really played as a unit in years, painfully exhibited in the leaden performances and produciton here.  &quot;Crush With Eyeliner&quot;, &quot;King of Comedy&quot;, and &quot;Star 69&quot; just miss the groove to get the hip shake that they set out to achieve.  &quot;I Took Your Name&quot; sounds too similar to (though it is better than) the earlier &quot;Crush&quot;, and &quot;Circus Envy&quot; and &quot;You&quot; seem like unintended parodies of the earlier Dead Letter Office's metal-parody &quot;Burning Hell&quot;.<br />The material that works best here are the songs that - surprise, surprise - are the most consistent with REM's history: &quot;I Don't Sleep, I Dream&quot;, &quot;Strange Currencies&quot;, the incredible &quot;Tongue&quot;, and to a lesser degree &quot;What's the Frequency, Kenneth?&quot;.  While the other material is of a piece with the album, and deserves regonition as such, it doesn't rank among REM's even average work and seems random and haphazard.  The last half of the album sounds not only like half-finished arrangements, they sound like half-finished songs.<br />Ironically, if the follow-up to Automatic had been the better songs from Monster along with the better material from New Adventures in Hi-Fi, the shift wouldn't have been so jarring and the public would't have become so confused and disenchanted.  It's also worth noting that REM has done a complete about-face from this kind of music and approach ever since.  <br />In a way, though, it did continue REM's tradition of defining things.  With previous albums, it was defining the times and alternative music.  With this album, however, they defined the term &quot;mis-step&quot;.
B00002E23E|4.0|When I bought this Led-Zeppelin DVD, I was hoping for alot more of them live, then those stupid fantasy settings.  The quality...on DVD is awsome, so is the sound.  When they show concert fotage, its just unreal. I with there was more special features and less fantasy stuff.  Other than that, its a great DVD
B00003CXCW|5.0|The mother of all backstage Hollywood movies that just never seems to age. One of the peaks in Billy Wilder's abundantly successful career is this fantastic film about a struggling screenwriter (William Holden) who takes refuge in the decaying home of a has-been silent movie queen (Gloria Swanson, in a career-reviving performance). He thinks he's hit easy street, but he soon realizes that this woman expects him to put out for her while helping her get ready for her giant comeback, a script about Salome that she has written herself. A cameo by Cecil B. DeMille himself helps lend weight to this great story, plus fantastic camerawork by John Seitz really allows the viewer to personally experience Swanson's fall into the darkness of insanity. Marvelous.
0688091717|4.0|My daughters and I love this book, but I subtracted a star because it is not quite the same story I expected. We checked it out of the library a couple times, then had to have our own edition. The story and illustrations are slightly changed. My daughters, ages 2 and 4, noticed the changes, and I think the story misses out a little.<br />For example, the library book starts with a bit booming sound in the jungle and all the animals are startled, but then we find out it's just the herd of the happy elephants who are laughing. The book I just bought begins saying \\"There was once a herd of elephants,\\" but then it goes on to say that they were happy.  Also, this edition does not have the bird who helps Elmer in covering himself with elephant-colored berries. Same story, but some very sweet details are missing.<br />I don't know why they've shortened the story; maybe they think children cannot stay focused for the longer version. In any case, I will be looking for an older edition, or maybe there's a current book with the same story.<br />Overall great book, but it has been better.
B00005QIPH|4.0|OK, I'm tired of hearing people bitching about the Strokes because there is a lot of hype surrounding them. Who cares if they sound the like the other 'the' bands (which I personally think they don't; actually not even close) and played on MTV (which I do not watch btw). It seems like you hate them because they are popular though and that's just wrong. Maybe if you actually listened to the CD with an open mind and judge it for what it is, not who they sound like or how much hype is surrounding them. It may not be groundbreaking at all, but it is fun, &quot;feel-good&quot; music, and is meant to be enjoyed not judged. Don't be such snobs.
B000062YAZ|1.0|what can i say the whole metal genre has been tired for a really long time. Also Look at the people who go to these concerts, hell, look at the band members they are freaks.my advice if you like this type of music is to get some therapy, and if you are a girl do not get pregnant. after that pick up some music for the mind like phish.  RELAX!! enjoy life
B00006AG5N|5.0|Elvis is still the hottest rocker. I pull out my DVD That's The Way it Is just to watch him strutting in his jumpsuit. If I had been alive when he was around, I would've made it my business to \\"get to know him.\\" Not only is he the sexiest man ever, but he was an incredible singer that knew how to put his heart and soul into the song thru his voice. He is always going to be Number 1 and any list that says different is worthless. I wanted to shoot my TV when VH1 listed Elvis 8th all time behind David Bowie. I like David Bowie, but c'mon his whole career can be captured in one album and he has been off the charts since I was a baby. With Elvis you can have 100 albums and it's only the beginning. He is the KING of Rock & Roll, Country, Rythym & Blues, ballads, Blue Grass, Pop, Southern Rock, Rockabilly, Classical and Gospel as well as the most electrifying stage perfomer in history and a great actor (despite the movies he was in) to boot. Who in the world can compete with that? Anwser: NOBODY.... Not even David Bowie.
B00003CXI1|4.0|Spirited adaptation of the first of J.K. Rowling's phenomenally successful children's books is so keen on being faithful to its original source that it loses a bit of its magic but is marvelous entertainment nonetheless (particularly for the kiddies). Harry Potter is a young orphan boy raised by his meany uncle and aunt who one day learns from a gruff giant named Hagrid (Robbie Coltrane) that he is a wizard, and has been accepted into Hogwart's, a school of sorcery for the magically-abled. Once there he experiences all sorts of adventures with new best friends Ron and Hermione, many of them to the chagrin of the school's kindly headmaster Dumbledore (Richard Harris) and the sharp-as-tacks Professor McGonagall (a wickedly zesty Maggie Smith). Perfect casting all around is a plus, not to mention state-of-the-art visual effects, a boisterous score by John Williams and inspired production design by Academy Award winner Stuart Craig (The Last Emperor, Dangerous Liaisons, The English Patient). Fans of the book will delight in seeing all their favourite aspects of Hogwarts brought to life so accurately, but those less familiar with the world of Harry Potter will lose their patience by the time they get to the anticlimactic last third. It's not as winsomely funny as the book, but it's still quite the charmer. Title in America is Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone
0312305060|5.0|I kept considering purchasing this book, but since I never read anything by virginia wolfe, i kind of strayed away.  finally, i got it, and i am so glad.  the book kinda grew on me...it was very well written, and had a lot of common themes.  if i was a student of literature, i'd write how each story line had many, many, common threads.  i really enjoyed the themes in the book.  i highly recommend it.
0066214122|5.0|I am a HUGE Michael Crichton fan.  I have read all of his non-fiction works and loved all of them.  So when I saw that PREY was out I didn't even stop to read what it was about.  From the first chapter it grips you and carries you through it.  I have already heard that 21st Century Fox purchased movie rights for it.  It is wonderful. I couldn't put it down.  Truly!  This book is very smart and unlike some of his books that can get a bit confusing with all the technical information, this book really explains things out...so you don't have to guess.  It's a wonderful book and if your thinking about it, just get it.  You won't be disappointed.  :)
B000008LOV|5.0|Once in a great while everything comes together for a perfect fit. This album has the perfect collection of great musicians, great songs, and it ALL just distilled together into a perfect batch of something so rare. Like that vintage wine all the factors made it a once in a lifetime stew. Even the same group could never repeat this feat. If you can find this BUY IT, but save your money since Volume 3 comes nowhere close. Volumn 1 is a grand slam in game 7 of the world series when you were down by 3 runs in the 9th inning. Volume 3 (the only other album) was not worth the effort and has maybe one song that could come close to being the worst one on Volume1. This is one of my top 5 albums of all time and I am 43 yrs young and have over 600 albums. The only thing i can recommend for fellow lovers of this album is GOLDEN SMOG , another &quot;super group&quot; which honestly i had never heard of any of the members. They have 2 albums both are very very incredible stuff !
B00005JL2O|1.0|This DVD is made by New Line's division of Infinifilm.  For some reason, the functionality of this DVD doesn't work on Panasonic players.  About the only functions that work are Stop and Play.  I feel sorry for Panasonic, because I got my DVD player for Christmas and thought it was a problem with the player.  So I took the player back and exchanged it for another Panasonic player.  But the &quot;Pause&quot; still didn't work.  I just today found out that it is a DVD/Infinifilm issue and not a player issue.  I'm afraid Panasonic is going to lose a lot of money if more people like me start trading in their players, because they think they don't work properly.  Maybe Infinifilm should include a list of brands that its discs don't work with.
B00005JKNF|5.0|Robert Altman's experimental style of throwing a giant ensemble cast into a situation and seeing what they make of it pays off in great measure with this delightful comedy about a giant British manor that is host to many zany guests of different temperaments and personalities. Kristin Scott Thomas and Michael Gambon are the lord and lady of the manor who are entertaining their various relatives and friends for a week-long shooting party, while the servants below stairs clamor to keep up with all the required serving and dressing duties under the direction of the head housekeeper (Helen Mirren). Altman's free-flowing camera follows both the above and under-stairs action until it all comes to a head when a prominent member of the party is murdered by an unknown assailant. Here is where the film takes its most delicious turn: instead of focusing on the mechanics of the murder or concentrating on divulging clues to the audience, the story instead focuses on the reactions by all the other cast members, most hilariously the fact that only one member of the cast, that is the sexy maid played by Emily Watson, actually mourns the deceased. Those looking for a good Mouse Trap-style comedy better rent Clue instead, because this one dispenses of its gumshoe duties early in the investigation process, kicks up its heels and has a great time laughing at its participants. If you're in the mood, or if you're a big fan of the wonderful actors involved, you will too. Kelly Macdonald is perfectly delightful as a visiting servant who lovingly observes the goings-on of the house and brings the plot to its head, and Maggie Smith is a standout as the disgustingly snobbish aunt to Scott Thomas, but probably the most effective performance in the film comes from Mirren-this woman amazes you with the very way she poises herself, ready for duty. The film comfortably resides somewhere just below Nashville or Short Cuts and well above Dr. T and the Women, and unlike Dr. T, the more openly-filmed,improvised scenes blend in seamlessly with the carefully scripted ones, and one can only admire Altman for this immense amount of control that he's shown in his direction with this film.
0385508417|4.0|In this fun, modern day Scrooge like novel, Luther and Nora Krank decide to ignore the Christmas holiday season and decide to go on a Caribbean cruise.  Just as the final preparations are underway, they get call from their daughter, Blair, informing them that she has decided to surprise them by coming home for Christmas. Bringing with, her new Peruvian fianc&eacute;e, hoping to take in the usual Krank Christmas festivities, Blair is unaware that her parents have decided to \\"skip Christmas\\" this year.<br />While I admit I'm not an avid Grisham reader, I can only say good things about this book.  This book is for anyone who tries to skip the commercialism of Christmas by ignoring it all together.  As Grisham reminds us, while we may be able to skip Christmas we cannot (and shouldn't) skip the true spirit and reason of the season.
B000005JA8|1.0|Listen to this at your own peril.  Be suspicious of albums like this - the crazy, cult following (and the music itself) is more as a result of the desire to be the weirdest of all then any actual desire on Beefheart's part to express his true musical self.  This is as bad as it things could possibly sound - and it hurts me to say that because we love Frank Zappa.  This album, however, is a blot on his (and humanity's) name
B00006CXXU|5.0|Stripped is what a CD should be. Its 20 tracks of goodness. 77 minutes that aren't misused. Christina strips down and shows us who she really is and what she is capable of doing. The album that starts with the  girl anthem \\"Can't Hold Us Down\\". Very catchy, Unlike most singers who use rappers to \\"hip\\" the up. Lil'Kim seems very in place here. \\"Walk Away\\" a song with awesome lyrics. Very jazzy and melodic. The piano driven \\"Impossible\\" seems like something Alicia Keys herself would do. But somehow I can't imagine anyone else but Christina doing it. \\"Beautiful\\" is a song that almost anyone can relate to. It is very uplifting.\\"Make Over\\" which has to be one of my favorite tracks on the album should have been released as a single. But probably won't. The song is all about the beat. Sounds very 70sish. \\"Soar\\" another inspiring song that could be done by a gospel choir. \\"Dirrty\\" the first single is over all a good track but a poor choice to be first single. \\"I'm Ok\\" is such a sad song to listen to. You can feel her pain in what she calls a \\"Twisted Lullaby\\" I can imagine that this song means a lot to people who have lived through this. <br />Overall..The album is really amazing. It is cool to see how much Christina has grown as an artist and as a person.
0385421982|5.0|This is my favorite book by Grisham. The plot is intriguing. The characters are well-developed. The ending of each chapter is a cliffhanger. I read this in one sitting. The book is far better than the movie.
B00005JKCH|4.0|Another comic book superhero finds his way to the big screen in this amiable high-flying adventure. Perpetually adorable Tobey Maguire plays Peter Parker, a geeky high-school student with an aptitude for science who is one day bitten by a mutant spider while attending a field trip to Columbia University, and suddenly finds himself developing strange powers much like that of the offending arachnid. Suddenly graced with exceptionally quick reflexes, impressive strength, plus major webshooters biologically emitting from each wrist, Parker goes from quiet underachiever to the city's hardest working crimefighter in no time flat. It seems his transformation couldn't be more perfectly timed either, because a new brand of villain in the form of the Green Goblin (Willem Dafoe) is intent on destroying human life to advance his personal breakthroughs in kinetic power. Kirsten Dunst does her best with the limp character of Mary Jane, a young woman who is constantly being victimized by one man or another and so seems to always be playing the same pity-me note every time we see her. It's no wonder Parker has been in love with her for so long: after all, it seems that falling in love with her would be the most complimentary way to feel sorry for her. Lack of pretentiousness and an excellent first act in the screenplay by David Koepp that allows for the best character development and personal conflict seen in a superhero movie since Michelle Pfeiffer played Catwoman is what sets this thrilling adventure apart from most of the summer fare that audiences are forced to endure, but there's a lack of power to it as well (particularly in the second half) that keeps it from being totally engrossing. This is probably due to Sam Raimi's decidedly uncommitted direction, but it also doesn't help that Dafoe's villain isn't all that scary or dedicated to an easily palpable evil endeavour (his main purpose is to kill the board members who are planning to shut down his corporation, and then afterthat decides that Spider-Man is his only nemesis and so tries to hurt him through the people he loves). J.K. Simmons pays delightful tribute to the original animated program with his boisterous portrayal of Parker's magazine editor, and Rosemary Harris is a delight as Parker's cookie-baking, patient and loving aunt. Look for cameos by Lucy Lawless, Macy Gray and Raimi mainstay Bruce Campbell in one of the film's most delightful sequences.
0066214122|2.0|The first half starts off well.  In the Crichton tradition it builds the mystery slowly. Little clues and red herrings are sprinkled throughout. The pages begin to turn faster until you are dying to know how everything ties together. It reads much like Disclosure or Airframe.<br />But then the ball drops into the basement, where Terminal Man days are relived.<br />Monster loose. Monster kills everybody. Hero uses gun/explosives/brown sludge. Hero escapes by helicopter. Hero calls Army (thankfully it's not the Costa Rican \\"more teachers than soldiers\\" Army this time, but rather the good old US Army who sits in a warehouse awaiting phone calls from panicked scientists to go blow stuff up).<br />All the clues, the buildup, and the tension were wasted. The wrapup was force-fit into a paragraph, and the grand mystery wasn't so mysterious after all.<br />...
B00004BZ16|4.0|When I distill it down to my favorite 50 minutes, it sounds like the best Clash album ever. And this is so all over the place, everyone who hears the whole thing ends up with a different favorite 50 minutes. Worth the time to sift through, and way better than &quot;Combat Rock&quot;. My personal 5-star version: Mag 7, Hitsville UK, Junco Partner, The Leader, Something About England, Rebel Waltz, Somebody Got Murdered, One More Time, Let's Go Crazy, Lightning Strikes, Police on My Back, Midnight Log, the Call Up, Wash Bullets, Charlie Don't Surf.
B00002EPJH|5.0|Keith Jarrett is an accomplished jazz pianist. Many of his recordings and live performances are characterized by passionate and brilliant solos - but this recording is different.  Jarrett has chosen a series of standard tunes and presents them as if he's performing a personal concert for you and your fellow-listeners. The piano (extended in its dynamic range) speaks volumes here. The tunes are quite familiar, but I heard several as if for the first time;  'My Wild Irish Rose' quickly loses its over-sentimental character, and the simple American tune 'Shenandoah' acquires heartbreaking dignity. My husband gave this CD to me for Valentine's Day, and I cannot think of a more loving or thoughtful gift. Highly recommended.
B00005JJX8|5.0|Cary Grant plays a famous thief who has retired to an easy life in Monaco. When jewel thievery goes on the rise in his city, he finds himself blamed for all of it and must clear his name. Grace Kelly is a visiting American heiress who gets turned on at the thought of his criminal activity, so naturally the two of them find a lot to do when they're alone in the dark. More famous for having been the film responsible for Kelly's meeting her eventual husband, Prince Rainier of Monaco, the film is one of Hitchcock's glossiest film adventures. Gorgeously shot in bright Technicolour, it's exciting and daring, a film you'll enjoy thoroughly if you don't expect the kind of suspense you get from Rear Window or Shadow of a Doubt.
0345409671|5.0|While many fans of the series may find this book a more difficult read than the earlier and now later novels, the book offers more intelligence than the previous novels (and many of the later ones as well if not all) The wordyness in the book helps to define the different characters and show on a grand scale the world in which these characters live, have lived, and how it all begins. just from talking to people i know who have read it and reading the reviews on here... older people seem to appreciate the book more. As for Lestat...well i must say i liked his character both ways here and there because they are one and the same...the more human lestat comes from seeing the devil and hell itself....i suggest reading the book again in a few years (even if you were older when you read it the first time) and taking your time while you read it...but overall i felt it was my favorite of rice's works thus for becuase the book showed off beautiful language and the characters where extremely deep and well thought out.
B00003CX8Y|5.0|I`ll be honest with you here - I went out and bought this DVD because I remember loving the film at the cinema in Britain a decade ago (well, I was around nine years old then, cut me some slack), and I wanted to re-aquaint myself with it.<br />So how does this film hold up? Was it a sane purchase, or has nostalgia messed up my brain, exposing this reviewer as a sad and lonely individual? Read on to find out....<br />You probably all know the story backwards, but I`m going to tell you anyway. Set in and around a quaint little village in France in the 18th Century, we follow the adventures of Belle (Paige O`Hara) a bright and beautiful young girl who finds escape from her everyday life - and the advances of a boorish, somewhat foppish suitor named Gaston - by reading books. Meanwhile, off in a castle, a cruel prince is turned into a tormented beast by an enchantress, also transforming his servants into household objects. In order to remove the curse, the Beast (Robby Benson) must discover a true love who will return his affection before the last petal falls from an enchanted rose. With the help of the castle`s enchanted staff, Belle sees beneath the Beast`s exterior and discovers the heart and soul of a human prince.<br />Beauty And The Beast came in the middle of a Disney renaissance (starting off with 1989`s The Little Mermaid). To this day, BATB remains the only animated movie in the history of the Academy to be nominated for an Oscar for Best Picture - something the likes of Shrek (2001) and the Toy Story films couldn`t match.<br />Disc 1 houses 3 versions of the movie (Original 1991 Theatrical release, Special Edition and rarely seen \\"Work In Progress\\"). I started with the 1991 release as thats` the one I remember.<br />The film looks brilliant, with a High Definition, anamorphic 1.85:1 transfer meaning I could pick out little details I`d never noticed before - and an excellent Dolby Digital 5.1 track too, the best I`ve heard this film sound. I`m no expert but I don`t think DD sound was invented back in 1991...<br />This is just simply a lovely, charming film - even though its` a story which has been told and spoofed countless times (most recently in Shrek in 2001). I also felt for the characters (its` rare when an animated film does that) especially the Beast`s \\"death\\" scene - that is emotional.<br />The animation is excellent - the famous ballroom dancing scene (because of its` use of computers) was groundbreaking at the time.<br />The songs are great - giving the film an almost Broadway/West End like feel, as if it was meant to be performed on stage, from the operetta like opener Belle, to comedy character song Gaston (funny!) to the superb Busby Berkely like, showstopping Be Our Guest (this song even inspired a \\"Simpsons\\" parody - See My Vest).<br />Be Our Guest in particular is a testament to the composing genius of Alan Menken and the late Howard Ashman, as it sounds like a classic musical song like you`ve heard before, yet it is also very fresh at the same time. 3 songs - Belle, Be Our Guest and the title song Beauty And The Beast - sung by Angela Lansbury in the film and Celine Dion and Paebo Bryson over the end credits, were Oscar nominated. The title song ended up with the gong.<br />Marvellous.<br />In the Special Edition version, listen out for an extra song called Human Again.<br />Disc 2 is full of extras - Making Ofs, Trailers, TV spots, Conceptual Art... the list goes on. I haven`t been through all of these yet but they`re very well presented indeed - if you have patience check out the Break The Spell game in The West Wing (navigate falling objects with complex button presses, and match character`s shadows to their human equivalents).<br />Some people may sneer at Disney for their curious paractices concerning Asian cinema, but the fact remains they have made some classic animated features - see this as a reminder of what Disney was capable of before \\"traditional\\" animated films fell out of fashion - and prepare to smile with joy, sniffle, and go \\"awwww\\" all over again.ile with joy, sniffle, and go \\"awwww\\" all over again.
B00007BH5C|5.0|Hearing this soundtrack, totally reaminds you of the movie. I love the music it so, so,  realaxing. My favorite songs are #6 & 12 because of the beautiful violins.
B00003CXCD|5.0|The world was introduced to Audrey Hepburn with this exceptional romantic comedy, and it's been a love affair between star and audience ever since. Gregory Peck plays a reporter working for an American newspaper in Rome who stumbles upon the story of a lifetime when a visiting princess (Hepburn) goes for a spree in the middle of the night. Thinking herself incognita, she eventually gives in to the sedative she was given back at the palace and in a drugged stupor ends up in his taxicab. The next day he shows her around the city, pretending to not to know who she is until he can get back to his typewriter and publish the story that will make him world famous. Unfortunately, a problem develops: he really begins to like her. William Wyler's direction is spiffy, Rome hasn't looked this good in ages, and Hepburn's fresh charm and adorable demeanor are simply to die for. A real classic!
B00005JL2O|2.0|There are just way too many scenes in this film, where there is an attempt to grab a cheap laugh with some bodily function.<br />What has that got to do with a spy spoof?  If the film is supposed to satirize James Bond then do it.  <br />When a film has to resort to numerous scenes involving defecation, urination, and passing gas that really shows a lack of creative writing.<br />These might be good for a laugh or two early in the film, but it gets old real quick.
B000002GC2|5.0|This album never got the credit it was due over 20 years ago.  The music industry was still reeling from the murder of John Lennon and gave the Best Album Grammy to his widow, Yoko Ono.  I felt it was in sympathy.  This was clearly the better album.  I brought the CD a year ago.  Every song on this CD is just like it was new.  From \\"Ay No Corida\\" to \\"Just Once\\" to my favorite \\"Betcha wouldn't hurt me\\".  It's a crowning achievement in R&B.  Way to go Q!!
B0000542D2|5.0|This movie brought back memories of my early childhood, I always liked the Beatles and this movie.  The songs are the best part of the movie and some of the jokes go unnoticed to those not paying attention.  This was a classic long before the MTV era, and it shows older is sometimes better.
B00005JKDR|5.0|When will those Pixar people ever run out of great ideas? Another classic from Disney's computer animation studio is this endlessly hilarious tale of two bedroom monsters working at the factory of Monsters, Inc. John Goodman and Billy Crystal more than ably voice the characters, who work hard nine to five scaring children out of their beds all over the world to collect the tots' screams that are used as energy to power their city. Trouble comes when Goodman happens upon a child who has accidentally escaped through her bedroom door into the monster world, a big problem considering children are considered to be virulent by the bigwig monsters who run the city. Goodman keeps the kid around and grows attached to it, inciting only bigger trouble from resident bad guy Steve Buscemi. A climactic roller coaster ride caper scene is heartstopping, and the quality of animation will take your breath away. On top of that, it's really funny!
B00005QG9J|5.0|The alnum is pretty kewl. unlike most albums where you only like one fo the song's they are all good and you don't have to sjip song after song. It's a great buy an d a must for any CD collection.
B00006SFBD|5.0|OK... this CD redefines heavy music and music in general as an entity of expression. This is by far one of the best metal cd's ever recorded in history... what slayer's reign in blood did for thrash.. opeth's newest does for the death/black metal genre. This disc cannot be surpassed right now. The last 5 minutes of the song &quot;DELIVERANCE&quot; contain some the sickest riffs and drumming ever recorded in history... the production and musicianship on this CD is so beyond what most bands accomplish in their entire careers. The solos and melodies are so mind numbing that many musicians will shake their heads in shame knowing they can never touch the sheer brilliance contained on this record. If you do not own this you are doing yourself a grave disservice to yourself and your CD collection. I cannot say this enough: you MUST buy this. This is an incredible epic saga of an album....
B000069AUI|5.0|I remember when I first heard Coldplay, it was months before lots of you people.  A friend had me download the song, and I was instantly drawn in by the intimacy of the lyrics and comparisons to good Radiohead and the Beach Boys' Pet Sounds came to mind.  If you loved Parachutes, then you MIGHT like this album.  I say that only because Colplay matured and so did their sound.  But it's not a bad thing at all.  The only song on the album that could have fit in Parachutes is \\"In My Life\\" which is still a beautiful song.  The most beautiful on this album would have to be \\"Clocks\\".  If you are looking for soft easy going rock with meaningful lyrics, get this album.  There aren't many out there that are better!
B00000JMQE|5.0|The great film editor walter Murch got the chance in the early Eighties to make a spectacular film compressing the first two sequels to THE WONDERFUL WIZARD OF OZ, THE MAGICAL LAND OF OZ and OZMA OF OZ, as a tribute to the Baum books he loved. The film was a popular flop, given that almost everyone who took their children to it expected it to be a sequel to the famous M-G-M film version of 1939. (In Murch's version, there are no songs and the carryover characters from the first film--Dorothy, the Scarecrow, the Tin Man and the Lion---look like the original illustrations of them by John Neill and W. W. Denslow rather than the way they were portrayed in the 1939 film.) But the film has endured as a cult classic, a master of the film art's tribute to the books and illustrations he loved from his youth.    It's an amazingly beautiful film, but it would be insanity to show it to small children. It starts out with Uncle Henry and Aunt Em, rebuilding their house and farm from the cyclone, take Dorothy, who has been speaking of wild stories of cities made of emeralds and scarecrows who talk, to Topeka for electroshock therapy. The asylum they bring her to is a terrifying chamber of horrors, and when she escapes it for Oz she is confronted with incredible other visual terrors, such as the lunatic Wheelers and the Princess Mombi (a variant of both the old witch Mombi and the Princess Langwidere from the Oz books), who exchanges pretty heads for her body the way other women change dresses. The scene where Mombi's headless body chases Dorothy through her chamber of heads (as the other disembodied heads scream in horror) is one of the scariest things I can imagine a child ever viewing.    But this is really a film for adults, and the creepiness of its details add to the mature viewers' pleasure. The sets and costumes are spectacular, the cast includes such accomplished actors as Piper Laurie (as Aunt Em), Jean Marsh (Mombi) and Nicol Williamson (the Nome King), and the David Shire score is one of the most beautiful film scores ever written--period. As for Dorothy herself, the producers chose such a unusually haunting Dorothy (with marvelous multicolored eyes and a curious plaintive quality to her voice) that the actress, Fairuza Balk, has spun a strong acting career from her early cult fame in this part.
0790729644|5.0|There are no heroes in Unforgiven.  Just the living and the dead.  Critics hailed this as a &quot;revisionist western,&quot; but if you look back over Clint Eastwood's entire career, you see that Unforgiven is just par for the course.  Eastwood's westerns have always been brutally violent, but unglamorously so.  From the vicious lynching that opens Hang 'Em High, right on through to Unforgiven, Eastwood has unflichingly looked at violence and seen in it our desperation to live.  He rarely has music over violence.  Punches are often soft and wet sounding, instead of always sounding like whipcracks.  It is brutal.  It is difficult.  It hurts.  So, while I don't sing the praises of this movie for any innovation, I do praise it for two things.  First, it embodies and summarizes Eastwood's examination of the Western and American violence.  Second, for the absolutely incredible performance of Gene Hackman as Little Bill Dagget.  Hackman's performance is one of the best pieces of acting ever captured on film.  David Webb Peoples' script is obviously a big part of that performance, but Hackman's portrayal of the man for whom brutality is a mere tool, who wants only peace, order, and to finish his house, is amazing.  His character is the only one that has figured out that being a dangerous man IS dangerous.  He is the only one of the dangerous men in this film to have found a way out.  Or so he believes.<br />This movie has a lot to say about America.  About the Western genre.  About our voyeuristic love of violence.  And it says it well.  It leaves you with much to consider.  That's much more than you get from most mainstream Hollywood fare.

B00005JGI6|5.0|I'm really sick of every American music critic comparing every new British band to Radiohead and Oasis.  Both are great bands, but have distinctive sounds that I have not heard a single band try to emulate.  Anyway, if you are a fan of Coldplay, I recommend this album.  They don't sound alike, but if you honestly enjoy every bit of the intimacy of Coldplay's music, then Travis is for you.   If you aren't convinced, listen to &quot;Sing&quot; &quot;Side&quot; and &quot;Follow the Light.&quot;  &quot;Sing&quot; is a beautiful opening love song.  &quot;Side&quot; shows that Brits can easily relate to the everyday monotony of American suburbia, and &quot;Follow the Light&quot; easily recreates the lush sounds and feel of classic Fleetwood Mac.
B00000AFWZ|5.0|I bought this set because it was on sale for Christmas and I am glad I did.  Rhino as usual did an excellent job with this set.  The sound is excellent and extensive liner notes and photos are included in the lavish booklet that comes with this 4 cd set.  This set which was based on the 1972 set compiled by Lenny Kaye.  The first disk includes that entire 1972 set.  Kaye's 1972 set helped inspire a whole genre of compilations of obscure garage/psychedelic music.  However, this set includes an additional three disks of material not included on the 1972 set.  The set also proves to be a great way to pick some excellent singles of some &quot;one hit wonders&quot; of the sixties.  Highlights are too many to mention but notable tracks include &quot;Louie Louie&quot; by the Kingsmen, &quot;I Want Candy&quot; and &quot;Night Time&quot; by the Strangeloves, &quot;Wooly Bully&quot; by Sam the Sham and the Pharoahs, &quot;Hey Joe&quot; by the Leaves, &quot;Psychotic Reaction&quot; by the Count Five, &quot;Lies&quot; and &quot;One Track Mind&quot; by the Knickerbockers, &quot;Incense and Peppermints&quot; by Strawberry Alarm Clock and &quot;The Little Black Egg&quot; by the Nightcrawlers.  Other favorites include &quot;Let's Talk About Girls&quot; by the Chocolate Watchband, &quot;Dirty Water&quot; by the Standells, &quot;Don't Look Back&quot; and Why Do I Cry&quot; by the Remains.  Shadows of Knight, The Amboy Dukes, The Thirteenth Floor Elevators, The Blues Project, The Turtles, Paul Revere &amp; the Raiders, Love, &amp; Captain Beefheart also make appearances.  Part of what makes this set great is the discovery of unexpected favorites like &quot;Mr. Pharmacist&quot; by the Other Half, &quot;Mindrocker&quot; by Fenwyck, &quot;Hold Me Now&quot; by the Rumors, &quot;I Ain't No Miracle Worker&quot; by the Brogues, &quot;Live&quot; by the Merry-Go-Round and &quot;So What!&quot; by the Lyrics among others are such unexpected gems. The songs range from the psychedelic of &quot;I Had Too Much To Dream Last Night&quot; by the Electric Prunes to the hard garage sound of &quot;Action Woman&quot; by the Litter, British Invasion influenced R&amp;B like &quot;I Need You&quot; by the Rationals to more pop sounding numbers like &quot;Open My Eyes&quot; by the Nazz. My only criticism is the lack of &quot;Gloria&quot; by the Shadows of Knight and the exclusion of material by bands like Blue Cheer, the Moving Sidewalks and ? and the Mysterians.  Don't let these omissions deter you fom this purchase.  The set remains in my heavy rotation and is worth every penny for the great sound remastering if nothing else! Fans of sixties garage/pyschedelic music should rejoice with the purchase of this set!
B00004UEDQ|4.0|On buying this DVD in the shops today, at a bargain price, I thought it would be pretty good, and did the whole sad eyes thing to my mum, to get her to buy it for me. On getting it home - the DVD wouldn't work. But it eventually did. Anyway! The DVD wasn't as good as I expected it to be. The only special feature I enjoyed was the Moment By Moment featurette, although it repeated quite a lot of the film. The film itself. It doesn't sound like a rehash of Girl Interrupted, but I think it was. Girl Interrupted is a modern day One Flew Over The Cuckoo's Nest, and 28 Days is a rehab version of Girl Interrupted. Am I making sense?! The character who played Sandra Bullock's boyfriend, got on my nerves, as did the German guy, but who was also quite good. Steve Buscemi (sp?) should have got a bigger starring role in this. The bit I hated, was when I started crying when Andrea (Azura Skye) killed herself. This is a good film for Sandra Bullock fans (ie. me), but not very funny at all.
B00005JLWL|5.0|Combining real-world situations with true suspense makes for the great storyline of EQUILIBRIUM.  My friends had to tell me about it when I returned from overseas.  It was out less than two (2) weeks and then vanished.  Search the web in your area for Dollar Cinemas or metro-area (& beyond) listings of theaters still showing this movie.  You have to give it up to the Wachowski Brothers for THE MATRIX.  They did what so many had wanted to do for ages.  EQUILIBRIUM eliminates the extreme amount of special effects and utilizes feasible explanations and plots to keep you on the edge of your seat.  If you have seen MINORITY REPORT, you get the same cascade effect of \\"Is the movie over already?!\\"  This is worth the on-time drive to the theater and only worthy of purchasing on DVD!  Christian Bale, Taye Diggs, and Sean Bean (though minor)...bravo!
B00005QDW1|3.0|Wow, remember when No Doubt was a ska band from Orange County?  No, not during Tragic Kingdom, but before.  Anyway, the band has been steadily moving towards a new wave style and this album is just about almost all new wave.  The best song is the only one not new wave, &quot;Underneath It All,&quot; which is more of a reggae and early ska throwback.  If you are looking for Tragic Kingdom and didn't like the direction Return of Saturn took, then don't get this album.  It is definately something different than what is all out there, but I still recommend it if you are looking for that sort of thing.

B0000640VO|5.0|this movie is a pure spirit-lifter - I would highly recommend to anyone (tho guys'll probably say it's a &quot;chick flick&quot;) - even with subtitles (which I didn't know it had), the movie flowed effortlessly. By the end I didn't even realize I was reading the subtitles - it came naturally. Everything about this film is amazing from where it's filmed, the color, the feelings, the storylines, the interwoven themes. Great for when yer down in the dumps to restore hope!
B0000630BT|4.0|Painkiller is probably Judas Priest's hardest and fastest heavy metal album.  A few songs (most notably \\"Leather Rebel\\" and \\"Metal Meltdown\\") are so fast-tempo to the extent that I they would almost classify them as speed metal, but like the other songs, they're still melodic. The style of heavy metal of this album is very reminiscent of the fastest, catchiest, and best music of Megadeth, Iron Maiden, and especially Iced Earth.<br />Priest definitely sounds revitalized on this CD.  Halford's voice never sounded better, Scott Travis's drumming is very fast and impeccable, and Glenn Tipton and K.K. Downing on nearly every track come up with some awesome lead guitar solos.  My favorite two tracks are definitely \\"Painkiller\\" and \\"Hell Patrol.\\"<br />Painkiller isn't quite perfect.  There isn't a whole lot of diversity from song to song, either from a tempo or a melodic standpoint.  Also, I don't like this version of the song \\"Touch Of Evil\\" as much as the '98 MELTDOWN LIVE's version.  Though, I'm generally a fan of keyboard and atmospheric enhancement effects in rock and heavy metal, I don't really care for the Dracula-like organ accompaniment which is employed in Painkiller's version.  The effects serve to make the song somewhat spooky but in a slightly cheesy way.  '98 Meltdown Live's version substitutes guitars for the keyboards and in this particular instance, it sounds a lot better because of that.  A lot of reviewers have stated that Painkiller's lyrics are cheesy and straight from a comic book.  The lyrics don't come across cheesy to me; in fact, I like them a lot.  While they may not have the profound mysterious and sophisticated cryptic quality of Iron Maiden's, they're a perfect match for this type of music and are no lamer or more fantasy-themed than that of most other bands of this genre.  I love the lyrics and think they're cool.<br />Though it's not flawless and probably not the very best Judas Priest production, Painkiller, nonetheless is one of their best albums ever and certain comparable the hardest and best melodic music of similar metal bands.  This timeless British band can rock!st albums ever and certain comparable the hardest and best melodic music of similar metal bands.  This timeless British band can rock!

0066214122|4.0|When I first started reading Prey, I noticed something that I'd never seen in any of the other Crichton novels I've read.  He immediately plunges into the character of Jack Forman, an unemployed computer programmer and current &quot;house-dad&quot; who is beginning to suspect that his wife was having an affair, writing in the first person.  By using the first-person perspective, he makes the character more real by directly stimulating a reader with the thoughts and emotions of a single character, something he hasn't tried in any of his other books that I've read.  A reader sees the growth and development of Jack as he has to further deal with the new micro-camera swarms that are being developed at his wife's start-up company Xymos when he is called in to review some of the computer code at the company's Nevada fabrication plant.  <BR>In terms of the science topics discussed in Prey, Crichton does a marvelous job of introducing and tying together genetics, nanotechnology, and computer science into the race against the rapid swarm evolution within the text.  As always, he takes many pauses to inform a reader to the meaning and importance of many scientific terms involved in the book.  For those less ignorant to the material than others, the reviews can get a little cumbersome.<BR>Overall, I thought Prey was a strong read.  Here's to an amazing writer who always does his homework. (if nothing else, his three page biliography at the end of the book clearly shows Crichton's dedication to his work)
0790729628|2.0|We're living in an age where it should be very simple to either burn both versions of Blade Runner - the original with voice over and the &quot;director's cut&quot; - onto one DVD. Or, if that's too much to ask, why not stick two DVD's in the package?<br />Some people like the voice over better, and others prefer the newer version of this movie. For me, the answer lies somewhere in between. There are lines of the narrative that I really enjoy, in particular when Ford *SPOILER ALERT* philosophizes at the end about why Hauer saves him.<br />I can't remember much more about the first version of this film. Sometimes the producers are right and their ideas make a better movie. That's not to say anything bad against R. Scott. The other movie is good too, just not AS good, in my memory.<br />It's nowhere near as bad as say...the sequal to Conan the Barbarian. Conan the Destroyer is a movie to be avoided at all costs...as is the second Highlander movie.<br />Come on you big shots at the top. Give us both versions of Blade Runner in one package at a reasonable price. I won't buy it until that happens.

B000059ZLH|5.0|And Dream Theater continues to amaze me, this time by producing an almost exact replication of their &quot;Metropolis Part II: Scenes From a Memory&quot; album in an epic New York concert.  As usual, the band doesn't miss a single beat and adds new dimensions of energy and excitement to the original music with their emphatic, brilliant musicianship on stage.  Included with the original album (and awesome onstage videowork that flawlessly complements the live performance) is a great background commentary by the entire band (though one gets the feeling that John Myung is a bit shy on tape) and performances of other songs from the concert not from &quot;Scenes From a Memory.&quot;<BR>If you're a Dream Theater fan, then buy this DVD.  If you haven't really heard much by the group, but you are a fan of advanced progressive/metal rock (especially by a group of such talented performers: John Petrucci is by now a guitar legend, John Myung less famous, but a brilliant, brilliant bass and lead bass player, and Jordan Rudess is one of the most impressive keyboard performers in the world), then buy this DVD.  The performance only adds to the magic of the already genius music.
B000021XS0|5.0|Scenes from a Memory is an 80-minute murder mystery.  The story has it all:  murder, reincarnation, hypnotism, jealousy.  The music also has it all: it's acoustic, heavy metal, spiritual, technical, classical, it's progressive.  Dream Theater has some of the best musicians currently making music:  John Petrucci on guitar, Jordan Ruddess on keyboards, Mike Portnoy on drums, John Myung on bass and James LaBrie doing the vocals.  LaBrie is often criticised as being artificial, bombastic, and overly operatic.  Sadly, I have to agree.  He isn't terrible, and his vocals improve with every album, but he's bringing the band down.  Don't get me wrong--he's got his great moments.  \\"Regression,\\" \\"The Spirit Carries On,\\" and various parts of most of the songs are quite impressive vocally.  <br />Now the instrumentation.  Dream Theater's music is very technical, another common criticism.  This one, though, I disagree with.  The arrangements are complex beyond belief; odd time-signitures, shrink & grow techniques,  double solos, it'll blow you away.  \\"The Dance of Eternity\\"  could possibly be the greatest instrumental ever, if not the greatest song.  But most of all the album flows:  the story is engaging and with hardly a pause in the music, DT goes from the acoustic intro to the impressive overture to a series of prog metal songs and soft ones, then classical piano of \\"One Last Time\\" and the powerful track \\"The Spirit Carries On,\\" to the epic conclusion \\"Finally Free.\\"  Overall this album is excellent--one of the best.  The songs are complex yet listenable, it's diverse and fun, it's engaging and well-arranged.   <br />Score:  9.7 out of 10.
B00005QIPH|5.0|There are very few CDs I have in my collection that I enjoy every single song.  This is one of them.  If you like 60s rock music like The Velvet Underground you will truly enjoy this album by modern artists, The Strokes.

I have no idea why this country is so sadly deprived of this truly SPECTACULAR music. Songs off of their Lifelines (2002) album include stunning epic-style songs rich with orchestral beauty, others are slightly funky, techno-pop style.  My suggestion would be to get the entire Lifelines album AND \\"Minor Earth Major Sky\\"  and feast on those two.  You will LOVE them.  To see a couple videos, go to [their website].  You'll see the videos for \\"Forever Not Yours\\" and \\"Lifelines\\" (beautiful!).  Make sure to click onto the flash video link as well to see a flash video for \\"I Wish I Cared\\" off their \\"Minor Earth..\\" album.  This song alone must be heard on a great stereo system to be fully appreciated.  YOU WILL LOVE A-HA!!!  They're my favorite group.  I can't get

The only people who don't like this movie are either Catholic or stiff people who hate to laugh.  Since most Catholics are both, it's not for them.  Hey, the stuff in the movie may not be true, but it makes you put down your stereotypical Sunday School lessons, and become open-minded about your faith.<BR>Great acting + Great plot = Great movie

0385503954|2.0|Even when I dislike a book, I give it two stars if I am compelled to finish it.This was the case with &quot;Atonement&quot;, which I labored through for many days, all the time wondering why.<br />What WAS this book? I feel like the author was probably laughing at all the rave reviews, because he wrote such a looooong bit of nothingness, so self-important, such a boring stream of consciousness---- surely it was a joke. As another reviewer said, it was much ado about nothing, aspiring to be called \\"literary\\" by its boring descriptions and endless details.<br />The entire story, even the ludicrous and contrived ending, just does not work. And I could find little of the \\"beautiful language\\" which so many people raved about.<br />The characters were not only uninteresting, but also poorly developed. They took the \\"stage\\" for such brief periods -- how was one to get to know them? Therefore, this reader never really cared about any of them.<br />The only reason I finished this book was because I was trying to find out what all the hullabaloo was about. That was the only thing that kept me going.<br />I wish there was something good that I could say about \\"Atonement\\"....I had expected so much from this book.
B000066NW0|3.0|The words to her songs dont make any since.  I bought the album because she has a beautiful voice that compliments the music,  however, I am exasperated trying to figure out what the heck she's singing about, expecially the song, &quot;Im with you&quot;.  I think someone should have helped, the little girl, write her songs.
B00005JKZT|4.0|No doubt, this movie should be a 5 stars for the effects alone, and the tremendous job of crafting a movie of this scale, Peter Jackson should get a special oscar for this.<br />However, 3 hours of travelogue grew a wee bit weary after awhile, and seeing there was no doubt how the ending would turn out, the Two Towers ended a bit flat for me.<br />Perhaps the first movie gave viewers an element of discovery about  Middle Earth, and that's what made for a stronger viewing. The Two Towers is more a marathon.<br />Still, see it on the big screen, and a definite stocking stuffer for next Xmas.
B00006J3T4|5.0|The Ragpicker's Dream is the third official solo album by this genious guitarist. No surprises, it is another very good album and he played well, but this is the first time his vocal made more impact than his finger!!! <br />The album is an mixture of country, honky-tonk, blues and completed with some rock. A very accoustic effort... this one. That's certainly not bad to somebody who does not believe a musician has to play the same type of music. To tell you the truth after couple of listenings, I was a little disappointed because of the lack of power jams in the line of Tunnel of love, Sultans of swing or Telegraph road. It does not even have something like 'Silvertown blues'. So what does it have... I found out soon that it has 'This is place we used to live' - a song sung softly and hits heart at the center. Wow, Mark that's a great vocal effort. It has 'You don't know you were born' with thumping drum beats (anybody expecting a John Bonham beat will be disappointed but it is rockable). It has the title track, which again is soft and superb. It has 9 more tracks that may not be his greatest songs but they fit well in an album that creates a new dimension for the man himself. The album was not 180 degree turnaround of few previous albums. He hinted that this album is coming up in Dire Strait's 1991 album 'On every street' (listen the song 'How long'), His first solo 1996 'Golden heart' and second solo 2000 'Sailing to philadelphia'. So we got an album 11 years in the making!!!<br />Now it seems that this is not going be as praised as 'Golden heart' or as successful as 'Sailing to Philadelphia'. Reason is simply, the lovers of accoustic/country kind of music may not pick this album in the first place because they are not aware. If you are one of them you can pick this album. You won't be disappointer. Some non flexible Dire Straits fan may find this album a little disappointing as this is quite a change of genre for them. <br />Had I written this review after 4 listenings, I would have given 4 stars, but now it has grown on me considerably. I will give it 5, a standard for Mark's huge talent.
B000069CWE|4.0|First of all, let me let you know what kind of music fan I am:  Mudvayne, Slipknot, Limp Bizkit...garbage.  I do like Tool, Deftones and Korn is okay.  I really like System of a Down, Rage, older Metallica and Incubus.  I'm also listening to more hip-hop (Talib Kweli, J5, Em) right now than anything else, so I won't bother listing them.<br />I've noticed that most people posting LP reviews 1)don't really listen to rock and 2)don't really listen to hip-hop (good hip-hop, anyway).  When I first heard LPs singles, I hated them.  Their guitarist and bassists are really limited in their roles in the band, same goes for the drummer.  I gave the band a chance and even saw them live.  Some reviewers blast them for being hip-hop disguised as rock...well, yeah, that's what they are.  A hip-hop group with heavy rock influences, no shame in that.  If you don't want to call them a metal or hard rock band, then that's fine...purists can have Slipknot (puhleeeze)  Mike Shinoda and Joe Hahn (who looks bigger in real life) are the backbone of this band.  Most of thier songs are structured around Hahn's beats, and it can be argued that they don't even need a drummer (maybe just for the live show).  Linkin' Park appeals to the hip-hop fan (or ecclectic...look it up junior) in me more so than the rock fan.  If I'm looking for hard rock I'll turn on Rage or Queens of the Stone Age.<br />Reanimation features some remixes by some of the most respected underground (that means &quot;good&quot;) producers and MCs: Pharoahe Monch, Charli 2Na from Jurassic 5, Alchemist, to name a few.  Those new to hip-hop may find this album to be a great introduction.<br />Personally, I would like to see LPs guitarists' and bassist's abilities showcased on their new album....that'll shut the critics up.(sorry I don't know their name, but they haven't given me reason to)
1573228737|3.0|This is the first historical fiction novel that I have read. I found the language set in Victorian era a bit hard to get used to at first.  The changing narrative also threw me a bit, but once I was familiar with Water's style it became easy to read.<br />Margaret becomes a Lady Visitor at Millbank prison to befriend those women who toil and suffer their isolation behind bars.  Selina, a spiritulaist medium becomes the object of Margaret's visits. Their relationship grows and is the intricate point of this story. The story contains hints of ghosts, theivery, secrets and forbidden love. The ending was a twist and in my opinion, very real.<br />I give this novel at 3.5 out of 5 stars, as it was an interesting read, but not my usual taste in novels. Water's does build her characters and make them real to the reader.  I would recommend this novel to others.

B00006CXXU|4.0|The worst possible thing to have happened to this album, was to have the worthless 'Dirrty' as the first single.

B00005JLSC|5.0|Do you enjoy musicals? This is the only question you need to ask yourself before deciding to see Chicago. If the answer is yes---then you must make sure you view this movie first on a large screen. A dvd or video version should be your second choice. Director Rob Marshall has put together a fast paced comedic musical that is utterly fantastic. The songs are of top notch quality. There's rarely a momentary pause in the action. Catherine Zeta-Jones, Renee Zellweger, Richard Gere, and others normally thought of as serious thespians perform splendidly in atypical singing and dancing roles. One, though, gets the distinct impression that these actors were thrilled to accept the challenge to get back to their early roots. Most of their characters are scoundrels, liars, and back stabbing slime balls. They are also very funny and endearing.<br />Two pre-World War II ambitious women entertainers, Velma Kelly (Zeta-Jones) and Roxie Hart (Zellweger) have murdered their lovers. Gere portrays the sleezeball attorney Billy Flynn who is committed to the proposition that anyone willing to pay his $5,000 fee should not pay for their crimes. Moreover, he hopes to exploit their notoriety to help them professionally. Flynn believes it's only appropriate to turn a murder charge into a wise career move. To put it mildly, he does nothing to uphold the honor and moral uprightness of the legal profession. Could William Shakespeare have been thinking of a Billy Flynn when urging that all attorneys in Henry VI be put to death? The only nice guy is the cuckolded Amos Hart (John C. Reilly) who is too dumb and naive to realize that everybody is playing him for a fool. Queen Latifah is wonderful as the manipulative jailer. Christine Baranski, Lucy Liu, and Taye Diggs also deserve honorable mention. Chicago most definitely earns five stars.
6305350205|1.0|This one was a complete stinker.  Why did they let William Shatner direct?  Didn't we all know he'd mess this up?  Even more disappointing is that this was on the heels of the best Star Trek movie - #4 - the classic about the whales.  Star Trek 5 had absolutely no magic at all.  This was a terrible excercise of 'running through the motions', complete with a terrible script, very reminiscent of the 3rd season of the TV series.

B00003CY6M|1.0|This has to be one of the worst 'romantic comedies' of all-time.  It makes the fatal mistake of having 2 UNLIKEABLE ANNOYING leads.  They are both so irritating and stupid, that, when you see the film, you hope they end up single and lonely, because they deserve it for being so stupid.  The John Cusack character leaves his beautiful and charming fiancee at the alter for a crazy girl who won't even give him her phone number.  Who would want to date (let alone marry) anyone like this.  If you want to see a good film, ABOUT A BOY was wonderful, as are most of the films on AFI's 100 years, 100 passions.  But, SERENDIPIDY doesn't even deserve 1 star.  I am a bit confused as to how films like this end up with averages of '4 stars' on.  Are the film studios writing all of these reviews?
0151008116|5.0|\\"The Life of Pi\\" may not make you \\"believe in God\\" if that is your inclination, but you most certainly will believe in Pi as one of the most exhilarating companions you have ever had.<br />Pi is the lively son of a zoo director living in the remote province of Pondicherry India. He soaks up knowledge of animals and shares it with whoever will listen.  He is enchanted with God and becomes a Hindu, Muslim, and Christian with exuberant impartiality.  As his father says \\"he seems to be attracting religions the way a dog attracts fleas.\\"  Life becomes difficult for the Patel family, and father decides to sell the zoo and immigrate to Winnipeg, Canada.<br />They embark on an old freighter for they are transporting some of their more exotic beasts.  The ship sinks losing all hands, and Pi finds himself in a lifeboat with a zebra, a spotted hyena, an orangutan (Orange Juice) and a 450 lb. Bengal tiger (Richard Parker).  Given Richard Parker's natural tendencies, the population quickly dwindles to Pi and Richard.  Pi is a resourceful boy, knows a great deal about animals---enough to be absolutely petrified of Richard Parker--- and decides his only chance is to convince Richard that he, Pi, is the alpha trainer.  This is not an easy task on a lifeboat.  But Pi has a few advantages.  Richard tends to get seasick and Pi has a whistle that startles Richard terribly.  They suffer horribly over the next 277 days, almost die and then revive.  They finally wash up on an isolated beach in Mexico.<br />The end of the story has a twist, and Pi leaves it up to the listener what he wants to believe.  I was profoundly affected.  Mr. Martel lets Pi be prosaically informative (but oh, so interesting) about animals and lets him soar with spiritual and imaginative beliefs all with an excellent sense of humor.  The reader must be braced for some hair-raising events and keep in mind that Pi is a survivor, just as much as Richard Parker is. <br />\\"The Life of Pi\\" is as magical as you make it.<BR>-sweetmolly-Amazon Reviewer
B0000640VN|2.0|I think 2 stars is generous here. As dumb romantic comedies go, this one was really really dumb. While I love romantic comedies in general, and often quite like these 'time traveling' films, I don't think they could have come up with a more stupid idea than jumping off a certain spot on a bridge to go back in time. Come on! If that wasn't bad enough, they have Meg Ryan's character falling in love with the 19th century guy (Hey, I'm not giving anything away, this was all in the commercials for the film) just because he opens doors for her. Give me a break. For a good romantic comedy, see:<BR>WHEN HARRY MET SALLY<BR>ANNIE HALL<BR>HOLIDAY (Katherine Hepburn/Cary Grant)<BR>SABRINA (the original w/ Audrey Hepburn)<BR>TO CATCH A THIEF<BR>THE APARTMENT... <br />or... for a time-traveling comedy:<BR>BACK TO THE FUTURE<BR>PEGGY SUE GOT MARRIED
B000002I8D|5.0|Phil's debut is a powerful one.  The ghostly &quot;In the Air Tonight&quot; is an awesome, spine-tingling song, featuring Daryl Steurmer on lead guitar, which he plays masterfully. Phil plays keyboards, manages the Roland drum machine, and is the culprit behind the cymbal-free drum solo at the end.  Actually, Phil got the idea of having the drum solo after playing the drums on Peter Gabriel's &quot;Games Without Frontiers&quot;, where he didn't use cymbals either. The other song that deserves a good listening to is his rendition of the Lennon-McCartney classic &quot;Tomorrow Never Knows&quot;.

The band is on fire for this July 1976 performance. They run through the best known songs from their first four albums (Gimme Three Steps, Tuesday's Gone, Simple Man, Sweet Home Alabama, Saturday Night Special, Gimme Back My Bullets, Workin' For MCA, etc). The performances leave nothing to be desired. The highlight of this collection, for me at least, is the awesome version of T For Texas. If you think Free Bird rocks, check out the guitar interplay on this song. Wow! The version of Free Bird is very good also, but supposedly contains a guitar part overdubbed by Allen Collins. I usually frown on tampering with live material like that. I'd rather hear the original undoctored performance. I was less impressed with the cover of Crossroads, which is basically a remake of Cream's version. The guitarists seem to be trying too hard to recreate Eric Clapton's solo, but they do an admirable job. <br />This is a great album which any hard rock fan should own and anyone with even a passing interest in Lynyrd Skynyrd too. The newer Deluxe Edition would be the best choice to buy.
B000066NW0|5.0|From the 1st day of May when i 1st saw the video for Complicated i became a fan. Exactly 4 days after i got the CD on June 4th of 2002 i knew every lyrical word on the album. From then to know, I have become avril'z biggest fan. This album has so many things that teenagers can relate to, and that iz why it deserves every star that i gave it.
B00007BH5C|5.0|Heartbreaking strains of music for a complex and dark movie, rousing symphonic music for a heroic epic. Soundtracks don't get any better than this.
B00005ASHM|5.0|In my opinion, the closest another band ever came to capturing the magic of the music of the Beatles was The Beach Boys (or should I say Brian Wilson) on &quot;Pet Sounds&quot;. &quot;Pet Sounds&quot; is the band's quintessential moment, much like &quot;Sgt. Pepper&quot; was for the Beatles. To be completely honest, I prefer &quot;Pet Sounds&quot; as a whole slightly to &quot;Sgt. Pepper&quot; but quite frankly, they are both on levels of their own. Anyone who prefers &quot;Sgt. Pepper&quot; is fine by me, but if you like that, you should check out &quot;Pet Sounds&quot; and vice versa. Some on this site have hinted that you need to be a Beach Boys fan to appreciate it, but I simply don't agree. If you are at all open-minded about great 60s pop music, I don't think you will be able to deny the immense beauty of this album. I know it's been said a million times at this point, but I think it can't be emphasized enough-the only word for the melodies, vocal harmonies, and production of this album is &quot;gorgeous.&quot; Just these characteristics alone have made it impossible for me to not jump on the bandwagon and call it the greatest pop album of all time. However, &quot;Pet Sounds&quot; is also my favorite concept album-if it can be considered that. &quot;Tommy&quot; by the Who is often considered to be the first true &quot;concept&quot; album, but if that's the case, I guess I'm not a fan of how overreaching some concept albums are. I prefer (and I'm sure there are others like me) a more simple, vague message in a album that leaves some room for interpretation. To me, &quot;Pet Sounds&quot; is a concept album because the lyrics undeniably seem to detail a beautiful relationship that slowly falls apart. &quot;Pet Sounds&quot; is a meditation on the joys of love and the sorrow of love lost, yet the lyrics are perfect enough (beautifully simple) that the message becomes timeless and can universally apply to anyone who has ever been in love. There is also a theme of lost innocence that perfectly matched the changing culture of the times. This was the right album at the right time and Brian Wilson deserves to be very proud, no matter what become of the Beach Boys afterwards.  The message of love told here is in my opinion, perhaps the greatest message that can be told in art, and that is why I am moved to call this the greatest album in pop music.st innocence that perfectly matched the changing culture of the times.

(espessaly cockroaches) <BR>The only, only saving grace is the fact that I have not read the book and have no facts to compare. and that the Special Effects where awsome. <br />Why isit that the really GOOD Sci-Fi storys(out side of books) only show on TV?...
B00003CXCW|5.0|It's a pity it took so long to get this classic on DVD for so long a time; but good things are worth waiting for, are they not?<br />Anyway...one reviewer, James V. Schrode, lamented that the movie was not released in widescreen. Well, James, that was simply because \\"Sunset Boulevard\\" was released to the theaters back in 1950....four years before widescreen movie screens were invented!!
B00000G3AZ|5.0|For some reason, film and Jane Austen are a winning combination.  I can think of few classic authors who have been so well served by movie adaptations.  This version of &quot;Emma&quot; is yet another success.<br />All of the necessary ingredients for a period film are here.  Glorious houses, extravagant costumes and a dashing cast are all used to good effect.  A special note is Ewan McGregor, demonstrating his singing chops long before &quot;Moulin Rouge.&quot;  He plays a fine rake.  Gwyneth Paltrow does good service to Emma Woodhouse, balancing between silly snob and well-meaning, vulnerable girl.  Jeremy Northam is a perfect Mr. Knightley and Toni Collette (Muriel's Wedding, Sixth Sense) is excellent as Harriet.<br />The DVD is bare bones, but the presentation is nice enough.  All in all, and excellent addition to a Jane Austen film library.  Good fun.
B00000K2SC|5.0|the movie &quot;the matrix&quot; makes the person who watches see the world in a different way and a guess about the future of the world. <BR>The movie is about the people who take one person from the digital world to the real world and he discovers that he is not a normal man. <BR>The acting was real and the special effects were amazing.
B00005YW4H|2.0|Norah Jones is not really anything special.  Her songs all sound similar and most are quite bland.  Norah Jones is not what I'd call a jazz singer.  Her songs are pop with jazz influences.
B00005JL7Q|5.0|Wow- This movie is so special. First, it is  a great comedy, full of excellent lines and situations. Second, it is a wonderful drama, excellent plot with deep issues that many can relate with.  The casting is great- lots of smaller names (aside from Hugh Grant, who I just loved in this movie.) He is so cute I want to bite him.<BR>So see this movie, you will be happy you did.  It has something special.. And the best part-  since it was based on a book, I was VERY impressed how close they kept the plot. Very refreshing.
B00000DFKF|1.0|(...) With Burzum, I don't have too much to say. Varg Vikernes obvioulsy has some level of musical talent. I don't dispute that, musically, this album is up there with the other Norwegian Black Metal bands (I STILL think Emperor were the best musicians), full of aggression and mixing it with odd passages of beauty inspired by Norwegian folk and history. What ruins it is Vikernes' voice. Whereas Ihsahn shifts from operatic to evil screaming, and Attila Csihar sounds like he's gargling glass, (both of which are perfect for black metal) Varg's screaming vocals sound like a dying dog barking desperately to get attention before it expires. It's not singing, it's not even screaming, it's just a bunch of violent barks closer to death metal than black metal. Hate the man, not the music...a good statement, except that the man destroys the music, and thus turns what is a good black metal album into trash (in my ears anyway). (...)
0805053883|5.0|I give this 5 stars because it is a GREAT book.  My daughter loves it.  Of course, I do think Brown Bear What do you see is better.  But, they are both great to have!
B00003CXRM|4.0|I was a reluctant convert to this movie, but now that I've seen this several times, I can't believe I ever resisted watching it.  The \\"old-timey\\" music speeds up rather than slows down the film like it does in so many other movies and I find myself singing with the Soggy Bottom boys every time I watch.  Just thinking about the movie brings a smile to my face.<br />The only reason I knocked off on star (I would have only taken off a half if I could) was the lack of extras on the DVD.  I would have like to have seen a few more, but I'll take Oh Brother any way I can get it!
B00005O5CM|5.0|Reese Witherspoon stars in this charming comedy about finding ones' self and just being who you are. Directed by Robert Luketic, it is light-hearted and funny.<br />PLOT SUMMARY: Elle Woods (Witherspoon) is your typical southern California blonde: she attends college, majors in Fashion Designing, and likes to get manicures. One night, her boyfriend, Warner (Matthew Davis), takes her out on a big date, and she and all her friends get excited, because they think he is going to propose to her. Instead, it turns out that Warner wants to dump her, because he'll be attending Harvard Law School in the fall and is looking for a more \\"serious\\" girl to marry, if he is ever going to become sentor. Heartbroken, Elle is furious and becomes depressed. But soon, Elle discovers that the only way to get her man back is to go to Harvard Law...a subject she knows little about. Elle is determinded to prove Warner wrong; that she CAN be smart. Surprisingly enough, Elle is accepted into the school. As soon as she gets to Harvard, however, she immediately stands out from the rest of the crowd, considering her wild fashion style and ultimate perkiness. But then, Elle has an encounter with Warner, and is surprised to learn that he has gotten engaged to a very preppy Harvard Law student, Vivian (Selma Blair). Vivian doesn't like Elle at all, and tries to make Elle's Harvard experience as miserable as possible, in hopes that she will find out that the school isn't right for her and leaves. Also, Elle is usually unprepared for classes (which also turn out to be miserable experiences), and Warner just can't seem to notice her. Meanwhile, Elle, upset with the way things are going, goes to get a manicure done and befriends the woman who gives her the manicure. This woman is lonely and depressed after getting a divorce from her husband and not getting a fair share in property custody. So Elle tries to help the woman get back what's hers from her husband. Also, while all this is going on, the womantells Elle that if she wants her man back, then she must work hard to get him, so Elle decides to become serious with her work. She is surprised to find that she is actually improving, especially when one of her professors, Professor Callahan (Victor Garber), asks her, along with a few other students--including Warner and Vivian--to help him with an assignment. The assignment turns out to be a murder case. The accused? A former president of the soroity house Elle used to live in at her old college. Elle knows that the girl is innocent of the crime, but no one on her team will believe her. So Elle is determinded to solve the puzzle of the case and get her friend out of jail. By this time, she maybe starting to lose interest in Warner, for another guy has come into her life, Emmett (Luke Wilson), who is assisting Callahan on the trial.<br />OVERALL THOUGHTS: I personally loved \\"Legally Blonde\\". The acting is superb by the entire cast, especially Reese--she ultimately shines, the script is clever and humorous, and is not offensive or dark. Since I am a Boston native, I have true appreciation for this film, since I'm always seeing preppy Harvard students whenever I visit Harvard Square (lol). The directing is awesome and it's just a fun film. You can enjoy it even if you are not blonde-haired! It's very girlie, but \\"Legally Blonde\\" will have you laughing away. The DVD is also nicely packaged, because the bonus features inlcude deleted scenes with introductions, exclusive featurettes, a Hoku music video, audio commentary, and trivia track.<br />I highly recommend \\"Legally Blonde\\".<br />Score:<BR>100/100<BR>A+
B00006DEF9|5.0|Singin' in the Rain has been my favorite movie since I first saw Gene Kelly do his fancy footwork when I was five.  I bought it a couple of years ago on video and have been waiting for a Special Edition DVD to be released.  The picture and sound quality are by far the best version that I've seen the movie presented.  But what puts the DVD over the top is the extras on both discs.  I love the documentaries and it's fun to watch the movie with the \\"Reel\\" extras.  From someone who loves this movie, this was definitely a loving treatment!
B00006AW2M|4.0|Don't listen to naysayers - this is one of the Stones' all-time best. Enough said.
B00005JLSC|5.0|I guess, calling it \\"The Show of the Century\\" might be not only premature but also probably preposterous. Calling it \\"The Show of the Decade\\" might be just plain premature, especialy since we do not have a name for the decade yet... But I can, and I will call it the best show of the year 2002 and probably the best show of 2003. The music is great - and always was. The actors are fabulous, the lead ladies  deserve supelative marks, and even more praise is due to  Richard Gere, who'm I would consider the lead actor of this show for the Oscars.  And yet  the superstars of this show are the guys from the choreography, from the lighting, from the scenery, costumes, - in other words from all those important things which make the difference between a \\"so-so show\\" and  a stuning and unforgetable performance.
B00005AQGH|5.0|The man we know as Tupac Shakur (aka Makavelli) is a genius he created an album so deep, dark, and eerie it makes us Chill every time we listen. Many people belive because of this album Tupac is alive and I belive that as well. Because If you listen closely he gives clues to his downfall. The clues were in such songs as \\"Bombs First\\", \\"Hail Mary\\", and \\"Blasphemy\\". Here is an in depth description of the so called \\"clues\\" on the album...<br />\\"Bombs First\\": In the first few seconds of the song a voice quietlty whispers \\"Suge Shot Me\\"<br />\\"Hail Mary\\": In the video there is gravestone that says Makaveli cracked with a hole in front of it which means he will be ressurected like Jesus.

B00006RU5B|5.0|This is one of the best rock albums of the year, if not 'the best'. You really do not need to be a big fan of RATM or Soundgarden to enjoy the Led Zeppelin-esque songs. You already know Cochise, but there are better tracks with Tom Morello's hooking riffs and amazing vocals of Chris Cornell. IMHO, Like a Stone, I am the Highway and What You Are stand out but this is an album that you have to listen to a few times for the songs to get under your skin. <BR>Definetly recommended.

0312305060|5.0|I'm stunned to discover that there are people who had trouble reading this book or thought it was only for snobbish literary types. I read it while sick and feverish just after reading a wild thriller by Carl Hiason (&quot;Native Tongue&quot;) and had no trouble at all figuring it out: it swept me forward, though at times the languare was so stunning I wanted to reread and savor a paragraph here and there. Though I agree that the '40s bored housewife wasn't as well drawn as the other two women, over all I was amazed that a man could depict the inner life of women so well. So many lauded, prize-winning new novels just leave me cold and I mostly read &quot;classics,&quot; but this book just blew me away.

0800179501|5.0|Ahh...one of the finest and most emotionally delivered lines in American cinema history.  But I digress....<br />This movie truly found it's way into the hearts of all kids who grew up in the 80's.  Immediately after seeing this movie - you could witness about 3 dozen boys and girls practicing the Crane technique on car doors.....baby sisters...etc.  <br />Take a loser kid from New Jersy.  Throw him in a station wagon with his mom (who leaves the computer industry for restaurant management.  Great career move Mrs. LaRusso.) and make him live in a dumpy apartment building.  Ahh!  But that building also houses a Karate/Jedi master named Mr. Miyagi.  Then, throw in a love triangle that includes loser Daniel, Alison (played by beautiful Elisabeth Shue) and Johnny - the kid with serious anger management problems and a wicked front kick.  Seriously, wouldn't you want to kill Daniel if he took Elisabeth Shue from you?  Thought so.<br />OK - now you have a group of \\"Kobra Kai's\\" that have an super-irrational hatred for this wimpy loser named Daniel.  After Daniel gets beat up every day for 6 months - he figures he'll call on Yoda...umm, I mean Mr. Miyagi.  Miyagi teaches Daniel to kick some serious ... by making him do all of his household chores.  Being the spineless wimp Daniel is - he actually hangs around to do the work (which includes painting Yoda's house dark green.  What the???)  This military dose of Spring-cleaning turns Daniel into a freakin' killing machine.  If only he would have had time to learn the other skills like \\"Grout the Tile\\" or \\"Plunge the Toilet!\\"<br />So - to prove him manhood, and to keep Elisabeth Shue from realizing that she's actually dating a girl, Daniel enrolls in the All-Valley Karate tournament for teens and 32 year-old Ralph Macchio.  <br />Before Daniel can achieve \\"balance,\\" he has his femur snapped in two by Bobby Brown (no - not that Bobby Brown.  The Kobra Kai that got slighted by not being allowed to fight Daniel.  What a jip. You know Bobby was going to win it all....)<br />No, it's all OK.  Miyagi turns back into Yoda and heals the crushed leg by doing some crazy sandpaper thing with his hands.  I guess body heat can reset a compound fracture.  Daniel is now limping but is feeling A-OK!<br />Shock.  Daniel wins the tournament by using the most telegraphed Karate move ever conceived.  Johnny practically sprints into the Crane move otherwise known as the \\"I'm gonna kick you\\" technique.  Daniel is champ - gets girl - and gets an approving nod from Yoda...umm....I mean Mr. Miyagi.<br />Seriously, this movie is a lot of fun.  It's one you must own.
B00006RU5B|2.0|I was curious to see how this version of Rage would sound and after hearing most of the tracks, I concluded this band falls short of the powerfull exhilerating standard that The Zach RATM set. Chris Cornell's vocals are bad. Why does this guy get such praise for that high whiney voice?. Its annoying as hell. <BR>Anyway this band is weird, I dont know what to make of them. When listening to the old RATM I felt like kicking the sh-t out of someone. Their music had an empowering presence. <BR>Audioslaves music however, seems like some self pitty bull sh-t.<BR>Bring back Zach or Get Chuck D on vocals. We need someone with some balls to sing
B00005JXY3|4.0|...he had just won the bad-... Karate tournament.  We get a quick glimpse of Miyagi's fighting prowess as he keeps Master Kobra Kai from killing the kid that lost to Daniel.  Great cameo's from all of the Kai's you knew and loved.<br />Now, we learn that Daniel got dumped by Elisabeth Shue.  (Big shock there.)  So, obviously, he goes back to Miyagi's homeland to help his Jedi Master.  Turns out the Miyagi has a Sith-Lord arch-enemy back there.  The enemy also has a son that wants to kill Daniel.  Staring to notice that Daniel makes people mad just by being around?  <br />Daniel finds another love interest and here we go.  We culminate with another fight to the finish.  Death may be on the line here!  Daniel immediately tries the deadly Crane technique but the bad guy saw the first Karate Kid about a hundred times so he's not fooled.  Uh-oh...no signature move?  Wait...we'll come up with this drum technique that gives Daniel the eye of the tiger or something.  You guessed it - Daniel uses the punching drum technique that wins him the match and keeps the hope of another sequel alive!<br />A few steps down from the first installment, but entertaining nevertheless.

0743506650|5.0|Starting with his first book last year, CARRIE, I've made my way through most of Stephen king's novels--I have a few to go.  I can say that King has improved over the years and in recent years slumped a bit.  This audio book gives wonderful insight on what circumstances shaped King's life, and what contributed to his zest for the written word.  King delves into his past and conjures up instances that are often funny and heartwarming.  King is honest about his past and the triumphs and tribulations that have made him one of the most popular novelists of the day.  Aspiring writers, such as myself, will benefit from the book as King gives a summation, or a small blueprint on how to get started in the business.  For anyone diving into this work looking to find a blueprint for success, give it up!!  Like King states, opportunities take time to manifest and most often they come from nowhere.  The listener will be given a brief background on King and the many people who have either contributed to his success, or hindered his writing.  I was deeply moved by King's description of the accident and his candor in explaining the details surrounding the travesty that almost ending his career and his life.  I'm 26 now, and I'm very thankful that I borrowed this audio book from my father; it moved me in ways that I didn't think possible.  It can be taken as inspiration to write, or it can give a person some insight into an influential writer and wonderful man.

0321146530|5.0|It's about time that someone wrote this book. Some programmers have been doing test-driven-development since the earliest days of our profession, and the rest of us have been wondering why it is so hard to development software the &quot;traditional&quot; (non-TDD) way.<br />Test-driven development (or as I prefer to call it, test-driven-design) helps you figure out the most useful interface to your class-under-test, without getting you into the psychological trap of not &quot;really&quot; wanting to test (and thus prove faulty) your &quot;wonderful&quot; code, because your code doesn't exist yet. The tests help you think about the implementation in small, mostly painless, steps.<br />TDD also helps you write portable code. By getting portions of the logical parts of your application done first (the &quot;model&quot; of &quot;model-view-controller&quot;), you easily keep the logic code OUT of the GUI code. Typically, programming without test-driven-design makes it too easy to put all your logic into your GUI class. Almost all books on how to use MFC and other GUI class frameworks mix the logic code with view code -- you should read this book so you can be a better programmer.
0553579908|4.0|The bottom line: \\"A Clash of Kings\\" is good, but not as good as the original.  It has the same basic structure as \\"A Game of Thrones\\", told in short chapters from many different viewpoints.  Since the scope of the novel is a bit too big to tackle at one time, I'll just summarize the major points of what I liked and didn't like.<br />What's good:<br />The storyline remains well-written and unpredictable.  As with the first book, \\"A Clash of Kings\\" is full of surprises.  Characters never do what you expect them to do, plans have a tendency to not work out correctly, and Martin isn't afraid to kill off a major character when you least expect it.  He still manages to steer clear of most cliches and avoids the dull tone that plagues many fantasy novels.<br />The chapters told from the point of view of Jon Snow, which are all set north of the wall, are excellent.  Not only does Martin make you feel the desolation of the landscape and its effects on the Rangers, but his build up towards a climactic showdown is very frightening.  Overall, this is the best part of the novel.<br />Most of the characters are still likeable and well-developed.  Perhaps the best one in this volume is Catelyn Stark, who faces a lot of exasperating situations as she attempts to bring a close to the war.  Bran and Arya's chapters are also very well-written.<br />Like \\"A Game of Thrones\\", \\"A Clash of Kings\\" includes plenty of detailed descriptions, and they are generally historically accurate in terms of the story's correspondence with the history of England and other regions of the world.  Some people might find it tedious to read all the details about weapons and armor, ships, castles, and so forth, but I think that it helps draw readers in and makes the world more believable.<br />Lastly, Martin's ability to juggle all of his characters and plotlines at the same time is still pretty astonishing.  He obviously put a great deal of thought into how this book needed to be organized, and paid attention to details such as ensuring that the timing of events in different locations makes sense.<br />What's not good:<br />One of the best things about \\"A Game of Thrones\\" was that rather than using the stereotypical 'good vs. evil' storyline, Martin was careful to give everybody a human side and realistic motivations.  However, in \\"A Clash if kings\\", the pendulum swings back the other way.  There are big passages that exist only to remind us that the Lannisters are really, really, really evil.  Also, Tyrion, who was one of the best characters in the original, is neither as likeable nor as funny this time.  (Although he does have one hilarious line of dialogue near the start.)<br />It seems that Martin gave a little bit less thought to organization and pacing this time around.  The result is a novel that's almost two-hundred pages longer and doesn't seem to be arranged for maximum effect.  For example, there's a thirty page prologue that shows us Stannis Baratheon laying out his evil plans at Dragonstone, but I think that Ser Stannis would actually have been scarier if we didn't know exactly what he was planning.<br />Finally, Martin's attempts to expand the cast of characters and the number of forces at work in the story doesn't always add up logically.  For example, near the start we learn that House Greyjoy has been amassing a gigantic fleet in the Iron Islands and preparing to attack the mainland.  But he never explains why the possibility of the Greyjoy's joining the war never occurred to anybody else in the story.
B000060MY6|2.0|The first two thirds of this movie were very suspenseful, but the last third really ruins it. To date, I have not been a David Lynch fan and now I know why.<br />The last third of this movie did not seem to have any connection whatsoever with the rest of the film. Same cast, but different characters and a different story. It didn't make any sense to me and I didn't see any resolution to the story by the film's end.<br />There's a scene just before the movie takes a dive, where the two lead actresses are watching a woman sing a Roy Orbison tune in Spanish and they start crying. I think the real reason they started crying was because they figured out they were in a movie that was about to tank.<br />For the David Lynch fans, if you enjoyed this film (and understood it), more power to you. I, however, did not.

B00006V9A0|3.0|This will be short, but it'll be worth it, I assure you.  This \\"Greatest Hits\\" would be more accurately labeled \\"The Singles.\\"  No real Nirvana fan would have put this album together.  However, it does have its strong points.<br />1  You Know You're Right (reason enough to get the album...no...you can get it off [local store])<br />2  Been a Son (this version is far superior to the version I had before off Incesticide)<br />3  Pennyroyal Tea (alternate mix from Scott Lit[not sure off the top of my head] is terrific, this is the reason to get the album)<br />4  Liner notes (written by some Rolling Stone writer, these are great)<br />So in conclusion, this is what I recommend:  Round up 4 or 5 of your Nirvana buddies, pitch in [money] each and buy one copy of the cd (new or used...perferably used), burn your choice of songs (most, if not all, you will already have), take turns reading the liner notes (commit to memory if you wish...goes well with beer), and sell the cd...it's what I did (you can look for mine if you wish)...this way...you ARE helping that murderous witch Love, but you aren't that much...
B000035P7X|3.0|Here is a most unflattering portrait of Bob Dylan. For one thing, he seems incapable of speaking anything but irrational gibberish as his conversation consists of little more than wildly scattered fragments that resemble the stream of consciousness speech patterns of a schizophrenic. The man seems incapable of clear thinking or precise expression. When he isn't making a smug fool out of himself by trying to take some artistic high road with a reporter because Time magazine \\"only prints facts - that's all they do\\" (in Dylan's confused mind, this is a fault in a newsmagazine?), Dylan is verbally abusing and harassing anyone within shouting distance: a science student who is subjected to Dylan's contempt and warped existential interrogations, his guests at a party because of a broken glass, reporters, etc. Dylan comes across as a spoiled brat, a boor; a self-important, self-righteous creep; a curmudgeon, a man whose mind seems to be in total chaos. The performances here are great, I admit; Dylan the singer/songwriter is powerful. I just feel sorry for anyone who ever had to put up with him as a person.
0684800713|3.0|I chose to read this book for an english project.  I figured it would just be the same old stupid book that you jss get to get the assignment out of the way.  I soon discovered when I started reading it that I liked it and it got my attention.  I'm not a person to sit down and read a book, I'd normally sleep over read but with this book that was not the case.  I foind myself reading it instead of sleeping.  I felt the book had a good story and showed how it was for the so called \\"lost generation.\\"  The book was very discriptive and I often pictured where the senceswere taking place.  If you have time on your hands to read I would recomend reading it.<BR>P.s. the book contains many sexual references.

0316666343|5.0|Regardless of what the first few reviews on this site have to say in their criticism of this book, I'm here to say it is a wonderfully thoughtful book told from a unique and inventive perspective. It grabs the reader, and I mean GRABS..., from the first paragraph, and  it unfolds with great detail and sincerity. I think this book will stick with me forver, much the way Lois Lowry's &quot;The Giver&quot; has done. It is so original as to cause me to place it in a category separate from any other book I have previously read. I'm left with a sort of sci-fi / fantasy / parable feeling, but the events (perhaps with the exception of part of the ending, though I think one should even read this part with an open mind) are strongly realistic and based on tragedies that happen in present day, as they have in the past. Susan Salmon will go down in literary history right up there with Holden Caufield. I consider my reading of this book to have been a gift from the author. Thank you for the opportunity to share in your insight and creativity.
B00006JU7T|2.0|I bought this dvd based on the reviews I read, well let me tell ya, this movie is very dated. The direction is very poor. Time in this movie moves very fast, the only way you can tell that a year has passed is by the length of Pacino's beard or the growth of his dog. The story is boringly (is that a word?) told. It would make a great re-make done by a better director. Maybe in the 70's this was cutting edge, but I found it as interesting as an episode of Matlock. Now with that said, Al Pacino is the bright spot in this black hole of a movie, his acting is the only reason I could stay awake. So if your an Al Pacino fan....and you have to own all of his movies then and only then get it, but if you just want to watch it once to see a great preformance by Al, RENT IT.
0312265859|1.0|This was the first book that I have read by this author and if this is any indication of her writing, it will be the last.  The only reason that I eventually did finish this book was that I kept thinking that it just had to get better but unfortunately it never did.

0345357116|5.0|The journey to destroy the one Ring and save Middle-Earth continues in the second volume of this epic tale, The Lord of The Rings, The Two Towers.<br />    The Fellowship has been broken; Gandalf the Grey has fallen into the shadow in the Mines of Moria, and Boromir of Gondor has been seduced by the power of the Ring, and then falls trying to defend what he tried to seize. Frodo and Sam are off to destroy the Ring, and the rest of their company has been left to defend the attack of the Uruk-hai orcs. Merry and Pippin have been taken captive by the Orc-soilders, who are making their way towards Isengard. Hope has been snatched from those that have set out to protect the Ring.<br />    The story, The Two Towers is split into two parts. The first part is the tale of the three heros, Aragorn, Legolas, and Gimli, and their search for their hobbit companions, Merry and Pippin. The second half tells of the adventure of Frodo, Sam, the Ring and their eerie guide, Gollum who leads them to the Black Gate of Mordor. <br />    During the winter break off of school, I had the opportunity to see The Two Towers in theaters. It was an excellent film, however it was not as accurate as the first film, The Fellowship of the Ring. There were two chapters, one from each part, that the movie did not included. One of the chapters actually contained the explanation for the title, The Two Towers. In comparison of the book to the movie, the film kept the attention of the audience but the book was easier to follow as far as the story line goes because only one part of the story was told at a time. Overall , The Two Towers was a masterpiece and another exciting part in the epic trilogy of J.R.R. Tolkien's<BR>ultimate battle of good and evil.
B00005JL5S|5.0|Oh my god! You guys out there have to go see this movie when it's out, it's really funny and good, Stephen Chow has always been great but I can say this is one of his best ever! Great grea great!
0553213105|5.0|Although I picked up the book for a 12th grade English class, Jane Austen captivated me with her polished dialogues and intricate descriptions. Pride and Prejudice is more than just a love story between Darcy and Elizabeth, and Bingley and Jane. It is a satire of a society in which money is the driving force behind love and social status means everything. The story is set in England and focuses on the four Bennet daughters, primarily with Elizabeth Bennet, who is the second oldest daughter. She meets Mr. Darcy at a ball and detests his pride. Although he is very rich and quite handsome, she is certain that Darcy thinks he is above his company, and that disgusts her. But although she is drawn to him by hate, the hate turns into love through a series of events and dialogue.  Austen uses rich dialogues to form her comedy, and in the end a reader will not only learn that love can conquer all pride and prejudices, but he will also laugh at a society full of arranged marriages and love based on what a spouse could bring to a marriage. This book is a &quot;classic&quot; for good reason. Austen's diction is exquisite, somewhat challenging, but after a few chapters, she has the reader hooked. Although picked up for a 12th grade English class, I know I will pick up it up again and will pick up some of Austen's other books. I would recommend this book to other high schoolers that need to read a classic for school, but also to people of any age looking for an excellent piece of writing.
B00005JKZ3|4.0|Okay, some of the sparkle is off, because we know what to expect, but it is still very entertaining, with a lot of really funny jokes. Lara Flynn Boyle is an alien (ala Critters sees a magazine pictures and assumes that form) coming to earth in search of the Light of Zartha. She is not as menacing at Vincent D'Onfrio, so that lacks, which means the film rests solely on the the shoulders of superb Tommy Lee Jones and great talent of Will Smith. All the old character from the original are back, like the marvellous Rip Torn as Zed. This is not long originality, but if you loved the first one you will enjoy this one. If you did not, then don't bother. Simple as that.<br />It is fast pace, with lots of in-jokes from the first film, a funny running joke of Michael Jackson wanting to be a MIB, Frank the Dog Alien hanging out of the car singing I Will Survive, and Jones and Smith's fussing over who will get to drive the car,<br />The Duo DVD is loaded with goods, the extra features on par with the set of the original, including a cartoon shown with the movie in theatres.
0066214122|2.0|I am a big Crichton fan, but this book ended by insulting my intelligence.  It started out wonderfully.  I couldn't get enough of the enlightening techno discussions and explanations, reminding me of the way Sphere started and progressed.  <br />Now the honesty--unlike some other reviews I have seen on this book.  I couldn't believe the dialog exchange in several parts of the novel.  How much did Crichton and his publisher get for the deplorably obvious ... commercial.  <br />This is the first book that I ever considered putting down.  The ending is awful!  I can't believe that as intelligent as Crichton is, he could actually agree to not only write, but also agree to publish such an ending.  It is inconsistent, ridiculous, obviously forced and unbelievable.  Crichton goes through over two thirds of the novel developing a somewhat consistent and complex story.  Then he ends the novel with pathetic inconsistencies that seem to be forced so that we have a happy ending.  I was anxiously awaiting the final third because I thought there would be a cerebral, complicated twist, but I was disappointed with a through-out-your-brain, amateurish, accomodating ending.  Give me a break.  <br />I \\"prey\\" that hope your intelligence will not be insulted as mine was.
B00006IU73|5.0|There are some reviewers comparing a great recording such as this to such artists like Radio Head ? who in my humble opinion are not progressive at all! its very misleading and far from the truth of what this CD is about. This recording kind of took me by surprise its alot heavier than the early Porcupine Tree that I am use to and its also very progressive , kind of like blending Threshold with Spocks Beard but even better again. Its also very ambient I would recommend this CD for anyone into  prog rock and prog metal this band have come a long way since the sky moves side ways. This recording has a great balance of light an shade and plenty of emotion , give it a go i think you will be surprised just how good it is.
B000002I6V|5.0|My older sister introduced me to &quot;Songs for Beginners&quot; just after its release three decades ago.  In the years since then, I've grown to appreciate it more and more.  &quot;I Used To Be A King&quot; ranks as one of my all-time favorties by any artist.  <br />One note of caution about the CD: my copy isn't a totally accurate version of the LP.  For example, the intro to the LP version of &quot;Used To Be A King&quot; features some studio chatter and a few stray chords from a piano and Jerry Garcia's pedal steel guitar.  Strangely, these were omitted on my CD.  I can't say for certain that all CD copies of &quot;Songs For Beginners&quot; were mastered similarly, but for you purists out there, this might be of some interest to you.<br />Other than that, the music from beginning to end is great.
B00000JCOV|5.0|To be completely honest ... even if I do have to deal with the rolling of the eyes everytime I say it ... i feel bad for people that don't want to take the time to appreciate what these men have to offer.  This doesn't mean that I think everyone should worship slipknot like I do... I just wish everyone could appreciate the talent they have.  If anyone thinks they can tell me that slipknot does not have talent.. i challenge them to listen to this album strait through... really listening to the amazing time changes that slipknot does.  No band out there today... works as well together as slipknot does.  There like a well oiled machine... they feed off each other and work as one musician.  Like they always say... without one of the nine members... the entire band falls apart.  and to me, thats the way any band should work.  The emotion and the heart alone that these men put into there music is amazing. each song is an adventure... and absolutly nothing is held back.  Thank god for slipknot.
B00006J3WH|5.0|I knew that this cd would be great because this was one of the most impressive episodes of recent Buffy...AND IT IS.  I was extremely impressed with the episode and am just as impressed with the cd, which not only has the numbers from the musical episode of Buffy, but also has a demo version (excellent to hear the song in it's early carnation- sung by Joss and his wife) as well as some instrumentals from other episodes (my favorite here is the suite from the gentlemen...one of THE scarest episodes of Buffy I have ever seen).  But this is a cd that the buffy fan must have!

B00005JLEX|5.0|Unfortunateley this show was never given decent time slots in the UK and was shown around midnight. This meant that shows like 'Frasier' and 'Friends' became very popular here due to prime-time viewing rather than actual content value.<br />Seinfeld satirises the buddy-buddy shows like 'Friends' and in my opinion is far superior and much funnier. Due to it being almost cult viewing in England I don't have much hope of the TV networks repeating the series. I can't wait to obtain the series in it's entirety on dvd and think it insane not to release such class comedy. Is 'Will and Grace' in the shops? ....my point exactly.
B00005JLRR|4.0|The crew of the Next Generation is back with a very good movie that deserves to do better at the box office.  The story, after starting with a marriages, veers into action after one of Data's brothers is found on an uncharted planet.  From there the story takes off and leads the crew and we the viewers through a nice storyline worthy of the fans of this popular series.  All the regulars are back this time around, including Whoopi Goldberg with a cameo.  If you are a fan you will be pleased with this movie.  If not, you will still enjoy the action and good special effects.  Worth seeing!
B00004ZAV3|5.0|The Beatles are unquestionably the best group to ever grace the musical scene.  What other group could make an almost 80 minute cd with 27 number one singles?  I am a relatively new Beatlemaniac, so I'll tell you my perspective on this set:  It is wonderful.  You buy it hoping to get 27 great number one hits, and that's what you get.  There is no filler (some songs aren't as interesting), but there are not many, if any songs to skip over.  This C.D. delivers, but...there is so much more to the Beatles.  Try not to be fooled in thinking that the number one singles are the best songs in The Beatles portfolio.  Granted, most of them are world class (and some of the best), but there are so many more songs that are so great out there as well.  Just buy Rubber Soul, and anything after it to find out what I mean.  Don't you love the feeling of:  buying a c.d. where you don't think you know the tracks, playing it, and saying \\"hey, I love this song.\\"  Well, with The Beatles, that happens often, with songs like \\"Oh Darling\\" and \\"I'm Looking Through You,\\" etc, etc.  I would also suggest not buying the red and blue albums expecting to get all of their the best songs.  These are good exerpts from various albums, but when I saw the track listings, I thought, hey, where's this song, and this song?  Basically, this set is great, but it should be followed with purchases of every other Beatles album.  Then get the red and blue albums to top off your collection, and to have great tracks all together on one c.d.  It may seem like a lot of money, but believe me (I'm not saying this to make it sound good, it's the darn truth :) ), in the end (excuse the pun) it'll be the best thing you ever did.  I'm so glad I bought my Beatles 1 album.  Now I all of the Beatles albums, and though I'm poor now, I'm gleeful and jolly, and have never looked back and given it a second thought.  Enough rambling:  BUY THE C.D.'S!!!
B00005JLSC|5.0|With the poplarity of \\"Moulin Rouge\\" last year and now, \\"Chicago\\", it appears that the movie musical is making a welcome return to Hollywood.  If the trend continues with excellent films like the two forementioned, we should be seeing musicals for a good time to come.  Catherine Zeta Jones and Renee Zellweger are both extremely well suited for their roles as Velma Kelly and Roxie Hart.  Catherine Zeta Jones has a very nice voice and plays the confident Velma with bravada.  Renee is perfect as the fame hungry, Roxie, determined to see herself in the lime light but instead ending up in prison along side murderess, Velma.  The remaining roles are filled quite nicely by Richard Gere as Billy Flynn and Queen Latifah as Mama Morton.  The nice thing about this musical is that the actors can ACTUALLY sing.  Everyone chosen for this film has a good voice and can act to boot!!  If you've seen the broadway show version, you won't be disappointed.  The director does an excellent job of splicing the musical numbers with flashes of the actual events that keeps the film moving along.  This is one of my favorite films of the year and will definitely be a dvd I will  buy.  Don't miss this gem!!!
0375414053|4.0|Allison Pearson is a brave woman. She says what many mothers feel, but are afraid to say. It's hard being a working mother. It's hard being a mother, period. But can we really have it all? A high-flying career and a balanced family life? Unlike some other reviews I have read, I won't give away the ending to this book. But what I can say is that I realize what a struggle it is to be a mother. That's what this book is about. This book is about real life, like it or not. Of course, this book's ending may raise a few eyebrows, but that's what I liked about it. I loved the ending, I may not have made the same decision as Kate Reddy if I were her, but I respect her for it. <br />If you are a mother, plan on being one, have a mother, know a mother, or are just plain curious about motherhood, read this book. I commend Allison Pearson for writing about reality, not some storybook romance where everything is \\"happily ever after\\".
B00006J3WH|2.0|buying the cd without seeing the episoide makes the music kinda confusing make sure u like the music from the episode before u buy it...
B00005YW4H|5.0|I love Norah Jones! This cd has been added to my list of all time favorite albums. I love her voice, I love her lyrics, I love her talent at the piano. This album is absolutely beautiful. Even if you are not a regular jazz fan,(which I am not, by the way) you can't resist the beauty of her music. Every song is fantastic. Even my 8 month old daughter loves it, we have made it her regular bedtime music. Slow, jazzy, romantic, anyway you want to describe it, this album is perfect.
B00005BJ9W|3.0|Believe it or not, I am 19 years old and consider Duran Duran one of my favorite bands of all time.  I first fell in love with RIO from finding an old vinyl at my local thrift store.  I instantly fell in love with it.The problem with this remastered version is it's not the same. Why are there practically a shortened version on every song on this one. I like the remastering but I wished it could have been a bit more bassy. My Own Way is striped of synth solos and Simons echo about broadway, which were my favorite parts of the song! Lonely's piano is covered up and overall song shortened to a mere three minutes compared to the vinyls five minutes. Hungry like the wolf is a terribly shortened version!! Hold back the rain is shortened and the bass is to loud,not enough guitar on all songs in general(WHYWHYWHY). New Religion is good except for its slower pace. The only songs spared are Last Chance,Save a, and Chauffeur. I hate to fuss but why did they change it. I would really like to know how to get my hands on the CD\vinyl version. In summary, good job but why do they not keep one original version. That is all!!
B0000013G9|5.0|THIS ALBUM IS SPEECHLESS 'CAUSE ALL DA SONGS R GOOD IN HERE, NO DOUBT! U CAN LISTEN TO DIS FULLY WITHOUT SKIPPING TRACKS 'CAUSE IT'S DA BEST ALBUM THEY HAVE EVER CAME OUT WITH TO DATE. NOT EVEN FANMAIL OR 3D CAN COMPARE TO THIS BECAUSE IN THOSE ALBUMZ THEY CHANGED UP THEIR BEATZ. THE ONLY R&B CD THAT CAN COMPARE TO THIS IS THE FIRST CHANGING FACES. MY SONG IS DA RED LIGHT SPECIAL. I ALSO LIKE DIGGIN' ON U, WATERFALLS, TAKE OUR TIME, SUMTHIN' WICKED COMES, CREEP, AND KICK U'RE GAME (WHICH SOUNDS A LOT LIKE CAN'T HANG BY XSCAPE). SAFE TO SAY THESE GYRLS LOOKED TASTEFUL BACK IN '94 I MEAN I WISHED THEY WERE MY GIRLFRIENDZ. FINALLY ALL I HAVE TO SAY IS THAT REST IN PEACE LEFT EYE! I MISS U SO MUCH, CAN'T WAIT UNTIL N.I.N.A. COMES OUT! NEW JACK SWING 4 LIFE!!
B0000255CL|5.0|i think this is a great album.it should not be under rated, or downtrodden, because those who speak so vainly of such an album's head will be severed off with an axe. i really enjoy guitarist's use of the wammy on certain songs, and at the heart of winter, the song, is a very good, innovative peice. also look for their new one!!
0151008116|5.0|I started this book yesterday, and stayed up until three am reading reading.  In the first section, Martel sets you up for what is to come with philosophy, religion, biology, and zoo keeper mentality.  Part II is the story, and an amazing one at that.  I saved part three for this morning.  Part 3 breaks down everything you thought you knew about this book.  I never read books twice, but I wanted to sit down immediately upon finishing and read the thing in its entirety from the start.  You don't see the end coming (even though now I've just told you).  The book is a masterpiece, it is the art of story telling at its best.  Where do you think the truth lies?
B00003CY6M|5.0|I loved this movie when I first saw it on dvd a couple months ago. I wish I could've gotten to see it in the theater, but I'm glad I finally saw it and now own it. It's a must have for all you romantic people.
B00006JJ1O|5.0|Basically, this CD is nice to have around because it's a good sound and fun to listen to.  But there is a lot more to it...<br />I have read several places, including reviews here, that there is an \\"ambiguously gay\\" marketing ploy going on with this album. I suppose that's a good thing for the homophobes to think, but I assure you... Nobody who's felt what these girls are singing about is going to be the slightest bit confused.  It's direct, obvious, emotional, and it rings of truth, all the way to the bone.<br />The feeling that there is something horribly different about you is an almost universal memory for gay and lesbian people of a certain age. I don't know for sure how it is now, but it's likely much the same.  There is a lot more information more readily available now, but who doesn't remember realizing that you think of and feel about girls the same way most girls feel about boys?<br />For a lot of us, this realization came before there was a name for it in our vocabulary... You literally think you're the only person in the world that's \\"that way.\\"  It's a sickening, painful, confusing feeling.  It's nothing you can change, and you don't know what will happen when you're found out. You're afraid you'll be alone inside for ever, at best... The worse options don't bear mention here.<br />The \\"normal\\" people around you mistakenly think it's a \\"lifestyle\\" or a \\"choice\\". Your parents don't get it... They're het. Most religion is no help. It tends toward the obtuse and myopic. Saying god hates gays is intellectually equivalent to saying she hates blondes.  She makes a *lot* more gays, for starters.<br />Anything that can help tell young gays and lesbians \\"You are not alone. You're a little different, and that's perfectly ok.\\" is a good thing.<br />And... Like I said, it's just plain fun to listen to, as well.

0066214122|4.0|Prey is a fun book; I read it cover to cover in one sitting.  If that's what you're after (and it was what I was expecting) great.<br />But the plot is a tad implausible.  The technology itself, of course, is not -- nanotechnology does, as one character points out early in the book, have the potential to save millions of lives each year, and it does hold some dangers as well.  The implausibility in the plot, though, can be summed up by one question: why don't gnats, termites, etc., in the real world behave as Crichton's &quot;swarms&quot; do?  That is, why don't the real-world organisms the nano-machines' programming is based on evolve in the same way the nano-machines do in the book?  Crichton's only answer, in one sentence buried in the middle, is that the nano-machines are man-made and therefore evolve faster, so they learn in a matter of days how to emulate human appearance, communicate, hunt, avoid danger, etc.  But why should their being man-made make any difference?<br />It's worth noting that at least one of Crichton's implicit predictions (the one in Rising Sun) was totally, unquestionably wrong -- the Japanese system of trade and industrial policy led to a huge recession and a near-collapse of the Japanese economy, instead of the corporate domination Crichton foresaw.  The problem with Rising Sun, too, was the fact that it didn't ask precisely why this problem hasn't already occurred.  In the case of Rising Sun, Crichton predicted that an economy with more government planning and sufficient ruthlessness would out-compete one with less planning.  He didn't wonder, even in the book, why, if that were the case, the Soviet Union hadn't already forced the collapse of the U.S. in the sixties.  A similar dynamic is at work in Prey.  That's not necessarily a killing flaw, but for a novelist with ambitions (pretensions?) of contributing to serious, real-world public debate about current issues, it is worth pointing out.
B000002UAR|5.0|When most people think about breakthrough beatles albums, Sergeant Pepper's usually comes to mind, along with the `white album', or perhaps rubber soul, and while all of these have a truly ingenious sound, I don't think any album compares to Revolver when it comes to originality. The transitions that took place for the band around this time really shaped the music on this L.P. into something extraordinary. The famous Lennon/McCartney song writing duo was beginning to drift apart, which resulted in more room for new styles for both John and Paul, but they were still helping each other out with the little bits of these great melodies and lyrics that made the album what it is. George Harrison was strengthening his status as a songwriter with the legendary `taxman' that is one of his most memorable song written during his beatles years. This album has some great love songs, but many written with different ideas in mind, a concept new to the Beatles, but one they managed well. From this album you can really see the different directions that band members are going as musicians, while still having the closeness of the band that produces such a great sound. All in all, this is one of my all time favorite albums, and I would definitely recommend it.
B00005V3Z4|4.0|Flying in and out of theaters before anyone really even heard of it, Donnie Darko is one of those little gems that most people will never see. It's a strange, genre bending film with a knock-out ending that will lead to hours of discussion long after the final credits roll.<br />Donnie Darko (Jake Gyllenhaal) is a troubled teenager who in-between zoning out at school and regular trips to his shrink, starts being visited by a demonic rabbit named Frank. Darko is told the world is going to end, and is given orders as this story becomes more and more absurd. Is everything what it seems? What does everything mean? And when the climax is reached, just when you think you're going to get some answers, plot twists the size of Jupiter knock you down for the count and confuse you even more. After two viewings I'm still trying to figure it out. But that is what makes this film so much fun. There are many puzzle pieces throughout the film, some obvious and some you never notice until repeat viewings. And the movie is so much fun to watch that each viewing is an intense, exciting experience.<br />A number of pieces come together to make this movie work. The cinematography is excellent. From the opening [picture] of Darko lying on the hill top road to the final image, each [scene] is disturbing, eerie and above all, beautiful. And the accompanying soundtrack fits these scenes perfectly. Most impressive is a hard hitting montage at the end to a haunting cover of a Tears for Fears song. The editing in a number of scenes is equally impressive. For example, in the first scene at Darko's school, the camera flies around switching from slow motion to fast forward, introducing all the supporting characters as they cross each other's paths. The results will have you rewinding the scene and many others over and over out of their sheer beauty. Helping the film in its disturbed nature is Gyllenhaal's characterization of Darko, sending down-right scary smirks and haunting glares all throughout the film.<br />Despite all these successes, though, Donnie Dark does have some significant problems. Much of the A-list supporting cast, such as Drew Barrymore, Patrick Swayze and Noah Wylie, while superb in their roles, aren't given enough to do. Barrymore and Wylie especially needed more time to establish their relationship and characterizations. Also, while the film is supposed to be abstract and mind bending, it sometimes goes a little too far without offering just a little bit of explanation. Mostly just some added character motivation here and there would make a little more sense out of it. <br />While some absurdity works and some doesn't, in the end the good in this film far outweigh its problems, and Donnie Darko shows great promise for newcomer Richard Kelly, who wrote and directed it. After all, any film that inspires hours of thought and discussion long after it ends succeeds on all accounts. You'll want to own this one for repeat viewings.
B00006CXXU|5.0|Rock, R&B, Gospel, Soul, Ballad, Dance...this album has some from just about every musical genre. It's amazing to see Christina not only sing these varied musics, but sing with such power and emotion, you are left in awe. She can reach those high notes as good as before and, when she needs to, can tone it down to almost a whisper.<br />Too many people labels her as going completely R&B due to the media spotlight that was shone on 'Dirrty', her first single. But besides that track and one other (Get Mine, Get Yours), the rest of the album is full of inspirational, and heart touching songs. Also, too many people seems to give negative review without even purchasing and listening to the whole album.<br />The album contains 16 full tracks and 4 interludes and uses the full storage capacity of the CD. And as it seems listing all the tracks and giving my input seems to be the 'thing' on reviewing music CD's, here it goes<br />-Can't Hold us Down - female empowerment song.  Not my cup o'tea. 7/10<br />-walk on - Needs getting used to at first, but will stay with you once it does. 9/10<br />-Fighter - a guitar driven rock song about reaching for that inner power and stuff. Hey, I'm all for rock! 8/10<br />-Infatuation - latin flavor here. 9/10<br />-Loving Me 4 Me - Christina's voice shines here and makes the music so much more better. Love ballad.10/10 <br />-Impossible - collaboration with Alicia Keys. Sounds like it belongs on Alicia Key's Album more so then Christinas. Starts off...eh, but has an incredible hook. 8/10<br />-Underappreciated - pleasent beat...almost like those you hear on Porn movies. Nothing raunchy, but you know that bass and guitar beats used in...nevermind 8/10<br />-Beautiful - beautiful... 10/10 <br />-Make Over - I dig the psychedelic groove goin on in this song. I can picture Austin Powers dancing to this. 10/10<br />-Cruz - Going from slow pace to fast, highly enjoyable song. 9/10 <br />-Soar - My favorite song in the entire album. Inspirational. I know that words been tossed around many times, but only word to describe it. 10/10 <br />-Get Mine, Get Yours - certainly a change of pace. Definite sexual innuendo.8/10 <br />-Dirrty - the song that is responsible for the whole raunchy image given to C. Aguilera. It's a dance song, and the beat gives us what it needs to. 8/10<br />-The Voice Within - a tender song, accentuated by a very gentle voice of Christina. 9/10 <br />-I'm Ok - a personal diary, of sorts, track. Slow paced. 8/10 <br />-Keep On Singin My Song - Akin to 'Soar', has a very Gospel feel to it. Could have been maybe 30 seconds shorter, but that would be merely nitpickin. A 'Lump in the throat' song. Moving. 10/10

0066214122|3.0|There's an element of Crichton's writing style I find incredibly annoying. It happens all the times in his book, and it gets overused to the point of making his book unbelievable\not credible. I find it so very aggrivating, and it makes me want to never read another one of his books. It's... **SUDDENLY THE PHONE RINGS**
B00006SFLV|5.0|I loved \\"My So Called Life\\". It's one of the best DVD purchases I have made in the past year!<br />The storylines are complex and believable. They deal the angst of being a teenager, but also with the uglier sides of the teenage years such as sexuality, homelessness, alcoholism, self-esteem, etc., which most main stream shows these days avoid.<br />The characters are amazing. They are not perfect, nor are they infinitely rich. They are very real and their interaction is intricate.<br />Add humor to the mix, along with superbe acting and you have the receipe for what is undoubtedly a truly amazing series.<br />This is the series that shows like \\"Dawson's Creek\\" and \\"Roswell\\" aspire to imitate, but fail miserably ...
B00004C4KZ|5.0|This album is like a strange impressionist painting, full of dark imagery and surreal soundscapes. There is no doubt that TD hit a watermark with this one, that everything came together for this recording. Edgar and the boys had a vision that was developing on the previous works, but this one really put it together. Everything changed after Rubycon and the sequencer-era TD. This album marks the best of what came before, and differs from later albums by the absence of any rhythm, other than the first track which has some mallet-work on some toms. Heavy use of reverb adds some of the ambience, a lot actually, but this album is pretty intense in parts. It definetly bears repeated listenings. The last rack is an experiment with human voice effects, like a John Cage thing maybe, which then switches up to a drone-like finish with more toms and mellotron. The boys were experimenting and it all sounds very fresh and inspired. Also it is not so minimalistic as the overlong and boring Zeit album.
6304913176|1.0|In the Summer of 1971 an acquaintance of Robert Heinlein arranged for me to meet the author at a party in Carmel<br />California. I was young and aspiring to be a writer. During a short conversation we spoke of his work. It was a memorable<br />evening for me.<br />  What came to mind when I watched this abomination named after Mr. Heinlein's novel of rights,<br />responsibility and honor on television, was that I was glad that he had not lived to see it. Apparently the executors of his estate thought the same because shortly before the release of the film Robert A. Heinlein's name was removed from the title.<br />  As a child of 12 when  I first read the novel. I was impressed by the vivid imagery of the mechanized armor of the Mobile Infantry and the descriptions of the alien hordes (none of which were the size of 747's).<br />  As a young adult facing the prospect of military service. I drew some strength from the small staured hero of the novel, Juan Rico rose above his short comings and gained confidence as he trained for military service.<br />  As an adult I gain satisfaction in knowing that the values presented in the novel are, with some slight modification, my values.<br />  Paul Verhoeven had no right to take a classic of Science Fiction and turn into into a mega monster bloodfest. During an<br />interview Mr. Verhoven stated that he wanted to make an exciting adventure story not a story of how democracy does not<br />work.  To Mr. Vanhoven I say: Why not write a story of your own and leave others works intact?<br />  Take heart, as I understand it, negotiations are underway to produce Robert A. Heinlein's Starship Troopers into a television<br />mini series using the novel and notes that the author wrote in contemplation of a script.<br />  In the meantime read or reread the novel. My son is about to turn 13. I am presenting him with a signed copy of this fabulous book.
B00000DR5D|5.0|I'd like to say that this album is quite as excellent as the others from this time, like Stratosfear and Phaedra, but it's a bit different (and interesting) for the fact that there is live drumming almost all the way through. However this is not like the drumming on the disappointing Cyclone album, which really doesn't even sound much like a TD album. The drumming is good, and there is prodigious use of toms with mallets (as on Atem) as opposed to two-four hihat-snare stuff. Anyway, the production is quite nice with interesting stereo effects, and there is an intimate feeling to the performance, as if it was a sunny warm afternoon and everyone was in the mood for exactly what was played and that's what the recording captured. By contrast the music manages to evoke typical TD soundscapes and carry you away, and this combined with the intimacy of the performance creates an interesting effect. There is definetly a lot of improvisation happening, but that's typical of their music from this period. To hear it live and even a bit raw is a treat - there doesn't seem to be any post-production effects added, not even reverb on the drums. If you like the Phaedra, Rubycon, Stratosfear period, this one should also be in your collection. A great snapshot of the band live from their classic period, with some cool percussion added to the sequenced space-echoed basslines. A final comment is that rather than fighting or adding clutter, the drums keep within the integrity of the grooves TD likes to create with the sequencers. And Edgar Froese gets a very nice dreamy sound out of his guitar (his amp was miked, not recorded direct like in a lot of their later stuff).

B00005MAM2|1.0|The original voice acting for this film was great.  Apparently some idiot sitting in an office without any clue about anything outside of a profit margin decided to redo the english dubbing.  The results are too terrible to listen to. Wait until a dvd with the original dialogue shows up.
B00005JKNF|2.0|As a British subject living in the U.S. I do love to watch films about home and country.  But what a pity about this film -- Gosford Park. <br />It's a pity that many Americans (and Brits too, I suppose) will watch this film and imagine that they now understand life in the English country house -- that this is the way it was and that they've had a bit of a &quot;history lesson&quot; along with the fictional story.  What sad nonsense.<br />I am weary of the tedious and uninformed concept -- upper class persons are feckless, mean spirited, and stupid while working class individuals are inherently witty, wise and noble --<BR>which infects so much of what passes for historically accurate period pieces like &quot;Gosford Park&quot; today.  I expected such cliches in a cynically scripted mess like &quot;Titanic&quot; which desperately needed to court the prole vote to succeed but I was surprised and saddened to find it served up by Altman.<br />Calling all period social anthros and decorative arts mavens! I challenge you to find all -- and they are ridiculously plentiful-- of the social and visual errors in the design of this film.
B00007BH5C|5.0|Sometimes I really question Howard Shore's composing - how can anything this good come from the hands of Man? The music is inspiring and takes you on a roller coaster of emotions, from calm and serene, to tense, to sad, all in one song.  These compositions truly touch something deep.  I really recommend it!
B00005JKDQ|5.0|As the title implies, I found this movie to be asolutely stunning, particularily in the character of the little girl.  Before this movie I was not aware that computer animation could be so advanced as to be able to accurately reproduce the actions and emotions of a person.<BR>I loved every minute of this movie and would recommend it to anyone.
B000069HK2|4.0|Now dont get me wrong...I really like this CD but it sounds really really familiar. When I popped it in I swore that I was listening to another band - these guys sound exactly like Thursday, so if you like their latest CD, you'll love The Used.
B00005YW4H|4.0|Norah Jones bears the slightest resemblance to a younger Natalie Merchant, which makes me wonder if this is what it would sound like if Natalie Merchant could actually sing. &quot;Don't Know Why&quot; brings to mind a delightfully woozy variation of Maria Muldaur's &quot;Midnight at the Oasis,&quot; and sets the tone for a delightful album of bluesy pop songs by a talented band. I wouldn't mind hearing some of Ms. Jones' piano licks sometime in the future, or hear her take a stab at some song that is Billie-Holiday-dark. She's young...so we will.
0142000663|4.0|This is a wonderful way to understand what its like to be truly deprived of the things we treasure most in life. it helps to better understand how precious life and family are. one minute they're there and putting up a fight, and the next thing you know, they're gone. There could be no worse feeling then knowing that your family is failing. The journey through life is a hard one and every moment should be cherished.
B00004YX0R|5.0|The string quartet is the highest achievement of classical music. How to describe what a great string quartet is/does? Four voices that sing, simultaneously dependently and independently. Or, as Goethe said, \\"a conversation among four very intelligent and witty persons.\\" After almost 200 years, Beethoven's 16 quartets still stand as the acme of the form, notwithstanding brilliant contributions from just about every important composer since. There are many wonderful performances of the Beethoven quartets available on CD, but none are more distinguished than these performances by the Talich Quartet. More than any other ensemble in my experience, the Talich's performances proclaim that intimacy is the true experience of quartet playing (and listening).  Every phrase is projected with exquisite attention to the constantly shifting balance of light and shadow that is the hallmark of the greatest quartet playing. Tempos are vigorous without being rushed, rubato is applied in the subtlest way imaginable, and dynamics seem to explore impossible distinctions between pp and ppp. In short, every performance in this set invites you to carefully listen to Beethoven's musical argument as you've never listened before. As a result, unless you own really sophisticated speakers, the best way to hear these performances is over headphones. (Sound quality is a bit dry, but the acoustic suits the Talich's style perfectly.) Last and certainly least: note the price. Originally available on seven premium-priced CDs, the new Soft Box format provides elegant packaging at a handsomely reduced cost. There is no one way or best way to play this music; Beethoven's accomplishment is too rich to be captured by any one performance or performing group. But the Talich recordings stand among the very best you'll ever hear. It's a very great privilege to listen in on their kind of conversation!
B00005QZWI|5.0|This has to be one of my top favorite movie scores.  The music is very haunting and Enya gives it a very celtic feeling.  I have almost worn out this CD (if that is possible) by playing it over and over.  Cannot recommend it enough!
078062999X|3.0|Kenneth Branagh, in trying to set his Hamlet apart, creates a spectacle that belittles the drama of our favorite prince. From the inundation of flower petals to the mirrored court(and Branagh's dyed hair), this is over the top. While acting, or really just making speeches, Branagh never forgets he is a movie star, and doesn't become the character. It's a different take on Hamlet, without the emotional pain and with a lot of bile. The developement of the character does not really make sense. The portrayal of Gertrude(Julie Christie) is also problematic.<br />  For it's good points, Derek Joacobi is excellent as Cladius, and the portayal of Hamlet's relationship with Ophelia and Polonius was revalatory. Also I very muched enjoyed the scene with the the first player(Charleton Heston) and the passages regarding Hecuba (which are left out of the Olivier version). For these two aspects this HAMLET is worth the price of admission.<br /> For any Shakespeare lover this is a must see, but based on Branagh's portrayal, I only give it three stars.
B00007BH5C|4.0|In my humble opinion a soundtrack can, often, be judged on how it stands by itself.  I attempt to listen to many soundtracks before seeing the movie and judge it on its own merits.  Many times I have found soundtracks that are excellent listening whether the movie was seen or not.  STAR WARS is one, GETTYSBURG is another.<br />However, I have to admit this soundtrack came up a bit short.  It is not bad, not bad at all, and after seeing the movie, I liked it even more.  But, be that as it may, it lacks the haunting quality that FOTR had.  I really wish more Enya had been included.  I really did not care for the last track, reminded me of the opening track for, a new Bond movie perhaps.<br />Still, if you enjoyed the movie, and I did, then by all means buy this soundtrack.
B000066NW0|5.0|This is the most consistently good album i have ever heard.  Every song, except for one could be released as a hit single.  The only terrible song is \\"Too much to ask\\".  The other 12 songs are hit material.  No other album has delivered so many really good songs on one disk.  She could headline her own tour on the strength of her first album.  How many bands or musicians can do that?
0671015206|4.0|Stanley and Danko do a commendable job of re-presenting academic findings in lay language, complete with anecdotes.  This book delivers as advertised.  It is simply a cogent description of WHO America's successful wealth-accumulators are, and more importantly HOW they ended up with massive nest eggs toward or at the end of their earning years.  They make abundantly clear that the majority of America's wealthy are 1) individuals who did not inherit their wealth 2) individuals who lived well below their means so as to save and invest large portions of employment income, and 3) self-employed, often providing jobs for numerous others.  The authors neither promise nor deliver any extensive commentary about the ethical dimensions of workload and investing versus spending behaviors, nor should they.  Reviewers decrying the lifestyles of these &quot;prodigious accumulators of wealth&quot; miss the mark.  One may take issue with the quote of one surveyed millionaire-  &quot;I am my favorite charity&quot;, but that is a completely different issue.<br />This book should be read by the legions of Americans who are in for a rude awakening when they can no longer work becuase they have accumulated few assets to work FOR them.  Finally, I would challenge any &quot;progressive&quot; thinker who advocates estate taxes for &quot;the rich&quot; to read about who they really are.  Where is the justice in confiscating the (already-taxed) fruits of a lifetime of self-discipline to bail out others whose lives have been spent in the trappings of the cushiest lifestyle they could afford paycheck-to paycheck?  On that policy basis alone, this book is worth a read.  My only beef with this work is that it tends to belabor the same key points, but given the stakes, perhaps that is not such a bad thing....
0393312836|5.0|Anthony Burgess' A Clockwork Orange is a true classic of modern English letters and one of the twentieth century's greatest works. In a nighmarish future society every bit as scary as 1984 (and far more plausible, it now seems), Burgess thrusts us into the world of Alex and his three \\"droogs\\": a world of ultra-violence, shockingly base treachery, and pure sadism. However, as anyone who cares to dig deeper knows, what appears to be a mere feathers-ruffling shocker  poses forcefully insightful philosophical questions. The notion of crime and punishment - as well as more practical side issues such as prison overcrowding - has been perenially debated, but what about some of some of Burgess's more troubling points: if we can somehow condition criminals to refrain from violent acts by quite literally depriving them of free will, are we in the right? Do we now have a harmless, perfectly good citizen or a mindless stooge who cannot even defend himself? If we take away a persons's choice, even the choice to do evil, are we left with something less than human? And, even more thought-provoking, is a person who does not do evil only because of being physically unable any better than a person who does do it freely? Burgess tackles these and other issues with sheer abandon, brilliant writing, and truly original vernacular. As ground-breaking as the movie was and is, the book is even better. A must-read.
B00005YTFG|4.0|To say MOULIN ROUGE is offbeat is stating the obvious.  Kind of like saying that feedlots smell and calculus is hard.  But offbeat describes this film perfectly--a film about the ostentatious Paris underworld of 1899, where finer gentlemen ventured under dark of night to get their kicks at the naughty and bawdy Moulin Rouge.  Expecting a musical with original scores (and there are a few), I instead was hit over the melon with a headscratching montage of Rogers & Hammerstein, Elton John, The Police, Madonna, Marilyn Monroe--even Nirvana.<br />Definitely post-1899 music.<br />Even more bewildering was the cacophony of Saturday morning cartoon sounds, accompanied by disjointed, incoherent, psychedelic editing that made me think Timothy Leary himself had spliced this movie together.<br />What in the heck did I just see?<br />But director Baz Luhrmann must have subliminally sprinkled this film with an intoxicating opiate, because I found myself watching MOULIN ROUGE a second, third, fourth time.  And appreciating it more--simply because of its dynamic uniqueness.  I began to enjoy this movie, to enjoy its almost ingenius irreverence for conventional musicals.<br />Granted, there's nothing unique about the love story (boy-meets-girl/boy-loses-girl/boy-and-girl-reunite-before-tragedy), although Nicole Kidman and Ewan McGregor give solid performances.  And the music itself is nothing to write home about.  It is the look and feel of MOULIN ROUGE that gives it its charm and appeal.<br />Approach this movie with an open mind, free any preconceived notions and ideals, and you'll walk away entertained.
B00000DC10|5.0|This album is from a Swedish quartet working in the post-Fugazi, post-hardcore tradition. What originally was a botched punk attempt of Phil Ochs' idea of a band that would be the perfect symbiosis of Elvis Presley and Che Guevara, gave birth to the mighty Refused. And the world is a better place for it - for their timely arrival and courageous departure at their prime.<br />What makes Refused's The Shape Of Punk To Come - their swan song album - stand out from any other similar group or record is the full-on experimentation that's pushed to the forefront of the mix. This is music for a revolution, though not just in word but in sonic deed as well, using revolutionary musical methods, various rebel styles, and world-turning passion. Be quaked or be left behind - either way your ears will be ringing with blessing.<br />Not only does it have a top-notch collection of absolutely ripping, loud and angry anarcho-punk anthems - that are both thickly produced and raw to the hilt - it also has some breath-takingly short transition pieces in between songs, that provide a non-stop flow to the album, pushing it beyond any demarcated pale. You'll find spoken word-rants against style over substance or presenting capitalism as organized crime, sudden eruptions of someone turning a static-filled radio dial looking for the &quot;Liberation Frequency,&quot; excerpts of electronic drum 'n' bass, glorious architectonic columns of feedback, tapes of faux roaring applause, and even accordions, melodica, and upright bass performances. And the CD packaging is inundated with manifestos, challenges, and odd insights - calling to mind the way some early punk albums had elaborate inserts a person could spend hours perusing.<br />So, in short, this album lives up to its title and should be welcome in any serious punk collection, particularly any of the landmark albums that have advanced the genre. But now that Refused have disbanded at the peak of their powers, I hope many other bands with thepunk spirit will carry the torch of exploration that The Shape Of Punk To Come lit. And set the world on fire with it. . . .

B00006GFAB|1.0|It's downright sad to see Stanley & Simmons keepin on milking the cash cow like this. Instead of offering the fans something exciting, the umpteenth compilation of studio material sees release. Since \\"greatest KISS\\" and the \\"box set\\" came out in recent years, all containing remastered studio material, there's simply no point in buying this. If you're a fan you already have all of these songs like, 10 times, if you're new to the band check out Alive I, II and III. This provides you with a much wider and more varied selection of the band's music throughout the years to begin with, and the live versions of the songs are nearly always the better and more energetic ones. If you prefer studio material, consider the box set, or the 1978 \\"Double Platinum\\" compilation combined with a few later albums like, depending on your taste in music, the heavier albums Creatures Of The Night ('82), Animalize ('84), Revenge ('92). If you like a more poppy sound, check out \\"Dynasty\\" ('79), \\"Unmasked\\" ('80) and \\"Crazy Nights\\" ('87) as well. Lastly, I also wholeheartedly recommend Ace Frehley's 1978 solo album. It's a trip. If you don't know KISS's music, go listen to some of this stuff, but just don't buy this \\"Very Best Of\\" -compilation.
B00007E8O5|5.0|This is basically the same as the other single release degradation trip, but the new songs make it worth the buy.Jerry Cantrell has inspired me to write and play guitar with releases of alice in chains, an degradation trip.For a while I could keep up with him but the way he plays and uses effects,on his newer release of degradation trip with the new songs, prooves he has talent beyond beleif.Like a Jimi Hendrix style with some. The new songs are all better than most of the others, but on Siddhartha,Pig Charmer,S.O.S.,and Thanks Anyway,he sings in the chorusy, like ways of the late Layne Staley.Brings it back to the Alice roots by himself with the way the lyrics catch on to the riffs, wich when compared to his other songs from the first degradation trip didn't seem like he could do that well.Above all this cd has some better songs added to the original,which make it worth the buy.(He does what people wanted him to do earlier, he goes back to alice roots in a close way.)
B00006CXSS|3.0|Another World War 2 show by Speilberg; adventure, heroic acts, everyones excited! You quickly rush home with your new Box Set. Happy as a little clam, you slide the first dvd into your player. 10 minutes later you feel about as excited as a kid with a melting ice cream cone. <BR> <BR>  Why you ask? Well there he is in all his glory, \\"Ross\\" from Friends, playing the part of a mean army officer. OK you think, I can watch a movie that suffers from bad casting, heck I made it through Titanic 5 times with my girlfriend. You carry on happily eating your popcorn. First ground battle happens, Americans get ready to ambush a small convoy of Germans (your shaking in your seat with excitement) The guns start going off, all the Germans start running around bumping into one another screaming like school girls, the Americans prove there military strength once again {yawn}.<br />  This is a good series if you want another GI Joe America type of flick. Considering how long it is more angles should have been covered. Heck why not go out on a limb and follow a German character defending his homeland from the grip of Communism on the eastern front, or at the very least another group of allied soldiers. Of course this would be unheard of, why display a more detailed look at the war that could be enjoyed by intellegent people, when you can just follow the same characters for ten episodes.<BR>      <BR>       The Veterans comments are interesting, and despite poor casting and Americans are the burning core of the center of the universe storyline, it does have its moments.

6305907145|4.0|\\"Mansfield Park\\" might have been part of the wave of adaptations of Jane Austen novels that made the long dead British novelist one of the hottest writers in Hollywood for a couple of years, but this is a different sort of Jane Austen, perhaps best represented by the brief nudity of a pivotal scene.  Of course, writer-director Patricia Rozema makes no claims to be providing a faithful version of the novel, choosing instead to offer a credit that declares the film to be based on the novel along with passages from Austen's journals, letters, and early writings.  Consequently, \\"Mansfield Park\\" is transformed from a novel centered on a most serious debate about religion and religious duty into a concerted attack upon the British upper class, laid out against the central character's prospects for finding a husband.<br />The central character in question is Fanny Price (Frances O'Connor), a self-effacing young woman with flashing eyes and strong opinions, which she might put down on paper but would never say out loud.  As a young girl Fanny is sent by her mother from the family's squalid city hovel to live with the Bertrams, rich cousins living in the country at the titular manor.  Fanny has formed a strong bond of friendship with the youngest Bertram son, Edmund (Jonny Lee Miller), but is being urged to marry the young rake, Henry Crawford (Alessandro Nivola), by Sir Thomas Bertram (Harold Pinter).  Separated from her beloved sister (there is always a beloved sister for an Austen heroine), save for their letters, Fanny becomes friends with Henry's sister Mary (Embeth Davidtz), who has her own eye on Edmund.  Consequently \\"Mansfield Park\\" offers the standard sort of mismatched affection that is always at the heart of an Austen novel.<br />The director commentary by Rozema was most insightful because time and time again she claimed that scenes I considered suspect were taken from the novel.  There is a decidedly modern sensibility to the way relationships are portrayed in this film.  At various times we become convinced that Sir Thomas and Mary are both interested in Fanny in a sexual way.  Lady Bertram (Lindsay Duncan) is constantly taking laudanum, the oldest son is a drunken sot, and the family fortune is earned by slave labor in Antigua.  Most importantly, there is sex in this film, not just the prospect of romance.<br />Of course, the chief enjoyment of any Austen film is in rooting on our heroine, and O'Connor shines as Fanny.  We suffer as we watch the facade she puts on in public, knowing we have seen the real Fanny when she reads to us what she has written, and we wait patiently for the man she loves to come to the inevitable conclusion that the intelligent and moral Fanny is the only woman at Mansfield Park worth taking as a wife.  Pinter's performance as Lord Bertram is perfectly marvelous and Davidtz as the cold blooded Mary, whose solution to the climatic family crisis makes it abundantly clear she is the antithesis of Fanny, provides the other standout acting job in the film.<br />In the final analysis, I am content with the inventions Rozema has brought to Austen's novel.  After all, these novels are no more sacred texts than the writings of any other great author that has been given the Hollywood treatment.  Certainly Rozema is to be commended for the consistent vision she provides with her novel approach to adapting the novel.  The integration of young Austen's early novels (juvenile efforts that were never published in her life time) fits perfectly into the film's narrative.  Some Austen fans may not be pleased by these changes, but they will have to admit Rozema created them as an appreciation of the author.this film.

B00002EPJH|5.0|I've never been much of a Keith Jarrett fan--especially not of his solo piano concerts--but I bought this album out of curiosity, and I'm glad I did. His rendering of these standards is thoughtful and unhurried, deeply emotional without being grandiose (well, most of the time). There's a sense of reverence for the instrument and the music that seems deeply influenced by Bill Evans, but Jarrett plays with more power and volume than Evans--and this power is both his greatest asset and his greatest liability. I wouldn't quite put Jarrett's rendering of &quot;I Loves You, Porgy,&quot; on the same level with Evans'  version on &quot;Waltz for Debby,&quot; but it comes close. All in all, an exquisitely sad and beautiful album.
6304712944|5.0|I am an advocate of all the arts and Broadway musicals have descended from the noble art of opera. The musical era of the early twentieth century did not die in the face of the Cuba/Missile conflict, nor in the war years of Vietnam. The brilliant musical masters, Rogers and Hammerstein and Lerner and Lowe were incredibly gifted, providing audiences with catchy melodies, romance and powerful dramatic emotions. In Lerner and Lowe's Camelot, we are immersed by the love triange between Arthur, Guenevere and Lancelot, which seems small next to the bigger picture- the stability of Camelot. Camelot is the ideal world, the perfect society, Utopia, Paradise. With the aid of the good wizard sage Merlin, Arthur assumed heavy responsibility as king and head of the Round Table, a fellowship of knights on the quest for the Holy Grail and sworn to uphold justice and balance in the world. This peace was upset by war and by the problematic situation that arose when Guenevere fell in love with Arthur's best friend and champion knight, Lancelot.<br />In this excellent DVD, the 60's film is back with full glory. We realize why this musical appealed to a generation that was insistent on peace. Richard Harris is the perfect Arthur, idealistic, romantic, wise, mature, and in his scenes with Merlin we do see the pararellism with the writings of T.H. Lawrence's \\"Once And Future King\\" and the magic (Arthur becomes a goldfish, communes with nature, etc, is similar to the Disney interpretion, \\"The Sword In The Stone\\". Richard Harris sings superbly in his solos, \\"Camelot,\\" and \\"How To Handle A Woman\\". Vanessa Redgrave was not the original stage interpreter of Guenevere. The credit belongs to Julie Andrews, whose light voice, cheerful, innocent and sweet temperament is directly polar opposite to Guenevere's lusty, earthy, darker-voiced portrayal. But in my personal opinion, Vanessa Redgrave captures the true Guenevere. This is evident in her song \\"Where are the Joys of Maidenhood ?\\" \\"Take me tothe Fair\\", \\"The Lusty Month of May\\" and her melancholy duet with Lancelot \\"I loved You Once In Silence\\". Franco Nero as Lancelot is charming, comedic, witty, a direct opposite to the upright Arthur, but we are sympathetic with his situation when his humanity comes through. He decides to break up with Guenevere out of his own love and respect for Arthur. Unfortunately, that is the moment when their affair is discovered, and the rest is history. Arthur battles Mordred, both of them lose and die, and Camelot disappears into the pages of myth. The rousing choruses are striking, especially in the wedding of Guenevere and Arthur and when Guenevere is sentenced to be burned at the stake. The finale is unsurpassed, as Arthur says: \\"Ask anyone if they've ever heard the story, and if they have not, say it loud and clear; that once there was a fleeting wisp of glory..called Camelot\\".

B00003CY6M|2.0|I'm a fan of Kate Beckinsale, but I'm really disappointed when I watched her in this movie.  She's not that bad, but the movie itself is bad.  The plot is boring and too predictable.  Of course this is only a movie, but I've watched other movies and though something called fate or luck seem to take place, they don't seem half as unnatural as the one in this movie.  It seem that the storyline made as if the two main characters were somehow brought together by the director, or the writer, rather than by fate itself.  I don't know if this movie was supposed to be a comedy, but I didn't find it funny at all.  Also, the fact that they both had lovers already at the time made it kinda lame.  I mean, would you like your boyfriend/girlfriend to go out shopping one day and fell for a beautiful stranger?  Well, just my two cents..

This collection irritates me to no end. \\"Been a Son\\" is, in my opinion, the single worst Nirvana song. On the other hand, I giggled when I saw that \\"Sliver\\" and \\"Dumb\\" were included. My major beef though, is that this is not even close to a comprehensive look into what Nirvana was capable of. \\"Francis Farmer Will Have Her Revenge On Seattle\\", \\"Very Ape\\", \\"Aneurysm\\", and \\"On A Plain\\" could have been added without even making the thing into a two disc set, which would have been a little bit less of a slap in the face to Nirvana die-hards.

Sure the plot was somewhat unplausible given a group of untrained ladies parachuting into occupied France and securing an important communication objective but otherwise this is classic Follett. His abilty to endear the characters to the reader is simply uncanny. I loved Flick. I only hope he'll re-introduce her in a future work. You will not be dissappointed in Jackdaws.
B00006JKON|5.0|It's not that Ian Anderson is _bad_ on the soprano and sopranino saxophone. It's just that everything that makes his flauting style distinctive, all the little tricks and fillips he does with his breath, his tongue, and his voice, simply can't be done on a reed instrument.<br /><br />Anyway, he seems to have worked it out of his system on _A Passion Play_ and this album.<br /><br />This _is_ a good album, no matter what some listeners have said about it. Okay, it's not my personal favorite either. But come on -- we've got \\"Skating Away on the Thin Ice of a New Day\\" back to back with \\"Bungle in the Jungle\\". These surely count as classic Tull.<br /><br />And all right, it's a return to short tunes after the album-length songs of prog-rock masterpieces _Thick as a Brick_ and _A Passion Play_. Was Tull supposed to keep recording album-length songs for the rest of their career?<br /><br />The remastering job here is nicely done, and the extra tracks are terrific. Some of them will be familiar to _Nightcap_ listeners, but \\"WarChild Waltz\\" hasn't been previously released; this is a sort of chamber-music collaboration between Ian Anderson and David Palmer. You'll like it.<br /><br />Plus there's \\"Rainbow Blues,\\" first released on the old _M.U. - The Best of Jethro Tull_ back in the mid-1970s. I always liked it and it gets a solid remastering job here as well.<br /><br />Again, not my personal favorite, but a very solid album. And even at Tull's \\"worst\\" (i.e. \\"least favorite of mine\\"), they're still better than most other bands' best.

Take the time - it's well worth it!
B00006JKOL|5.0|I haven't yet bought the newly remastered CD with all the extra tracks, so this review will comment only on the content from the older CD and the original LP.<br />This is one of my favorite Tull albums. I personally think that this is where they were really hitting their stride as a _great_ band.<br />The personnel at this point: Jeffrey Hammond is doing his last turn on the bass, Barrie Barlow is on drums and percussion, and John Evan is handling the keyboards. (David Palmer is here, as always, doing orchestral arrangements, but he's not yet a full member of the band.)<br />The content: searing electric rock and acoustic balladry, in a seamless mix that blends the influences of British folk music and modern rock into an organic whole. Turn it up and stand back.<br />The major highlight here is, of course, &quot;Baker Street Muse,&quot; one of Ian Anderson's most autobiographical pieces (and the title of which makes a punning reference to the Baker Street mews in which he lived at the time). By turns bawdy seamy, earnest, cynical, and self-parodying, this sprawling, multifaceted opus continues Anderson's deeply ambiguous exploration of the harsh realities of poverty, homelessness, and such, with no easy resolution anywhere in sight.<br />There are also some delightfully gentle acoustic tunes alongside the serious rockers. Martin Barre shines, too, taking center stage as needed with his blistering electric-guitar work and also doing some subtle acoustic stuff when nobody is looking.<br />This album is good enough, in short, that even though I already have it on CD, I plan to buy the remastered one _anyway_. 'Nuff said.
B00005RFAI|4.0|I bought this CD last year with some hesitation.  I was thinking I was getting some bubble gum pop music a la Britney and others like her.  I was mistaken.  Pink is indeed the answer to the sugary sweet pop that Ms. Spears has put out.  The CD has grown on me and after watching VH1's show &quot;Driven&quot; which featured Pink recently brought everything into perspective.  Pink is indeeed an artist who bares her soul through her music.  This CD has a nice ecclectic mix of tunes, but the more introspective ones all feature Pink's unflinching lyrical touch.  She is unafraid to confront the issues that have been in her life or say how it is.  She is a brave young woman who is willing to forge her own path as a musician and refuses to be typecast as yet another cookie cutter pop princess.  Give this CD a listen!
B00000GAIW|5.0|. . . or choose your own favorite cliche. Whatever you call it, this album was and is of historical importance, for Tull and for 1970s rock.<br /><br />In part, that's because it was misdescribed. No sooner was it released than the rock press started hailing it as a \\"concept album\\" (prompting Ian Anderson to go to work on the surreal and Pythonesque _Thick as a Brick_ so as to give everybody, tongue firmly in cheek, a _real_ \\"concept album\\").<br /><br />\\"Concept albums\\" are frowned on these days (although I like them just fine); nevertheless this isn't one of them. Sure, there's a lot of thematic unity; the first half (\\"album side\\") involves homelessness and lechery, and the second Anderson's reflections on the religious upbringing of his adolescence. But a \\"concept album\\"? Not really.<br /><br />But it does reflect a critical stage in the development of Jethro Tull. Bassist Glenn Cornick had just departed and been replaced by Anderson's boyhood friend Jeffrey Hammond; as of the next album (TaaB) Barrie Barlow would replace Clive Bunker on drums and percussion. And crucially, two things were happening on this album that would affect Tull's direction for the remainder of its still-ongoing career: Anderson was developing both his songwriting and his acoustic guitar chops, and Martin Barre was successfully finding his \\"voice\\" as a guitarist.<br /><br />It's something of a cliche among Tull fans that Anderson's songwriting had taken a darker, more cynical turn as of _Benefit_ (the album preceding this one). Well, on _Aqualung_ that bitter fruit is really starting to ripen. There's the title track, of course, for which Anderson credits the lyrics to his first wife Jennie (he lifted many of them from her notes on the back sides of her photographs of homeless people). There's \\"Cross-Eyed Mary\\". And there's all the stuff about Anglican-and-perhaps-other Christianity. This sort of thing was to continue through _Minstrel in the Gallery_ (especially \\"Baker Street Muse\\"), roughly until Anderson moved to the country.<br /><br />Anderson was also developing what we now know as \\"his\\" acoustic guitar style. There was a bit of it on _Benefit_ but it's really here that we started hearing his acoustic tunes (\\"Wond'ring Aloud,\\" etc.); we heard some more early acoustic tunes on _Living in the Past_, but that album hadn't been released yet when _Aqualung_ came out.<br /><br />And Martin Barre had turned himself into the Tull lead guitarist we all know and love. The opening blast of \\"Aqualung\\" is quintessential Tull; the guitar solo on that song ranks among rock's greatest; and I don't know about you, but when I listen to \\"Locomotive Breath,\\" I have to remember to breathe myself.<br /><br />Now, for all that, this is not my favorite Tull album (or even my favorite _early_ Tull album). But I don't think a month goes by that I don't listen to _something_ from it.<br /><br />The remastered version is clean and crisp, and to my ear somewhat anechoic. The extra tracks are notable mainly for the inclusion of \\"Lick Your Fingers Clean\\" (an earlier version of \\"Two Fingers,\\" released on _WarChild_ but originally intended for this one). There are also extended excerpts from an interview and remastered versions of \\"Song for Jeffrey,\\" \\"Fat Man\\" and \\"Bouree\\", all of which are now available on the remastered _Stand Up_ anyway (where I think the remastering is done better), and a \\"quad\\" version of \\"Wind Up\\".ountry.

B000007S5B|5.0|The Doors were--and are--one of rock's greatest bands, with a unique sound all of their own. Flamboyant frontman Jim Morrison may have been the face & image of the group, but these guys always worked together like a classy four-headed machine to produce some of rock's greatest music. Picking a favorite Doors album is hard---even the criticized \\"Soft Parade\\" album has got some terrific Doors gems on it. But 1968's \\"Waiting For The Sun\\" is my personal favorite from The Doors. It's a great Doors classic that sees the band masterfully walking the tightrope between the hard rockers and the softer ballads. For their third album, singer Morrison, keyboardist Ray Manzarek, guitarist Robby Krieger & drummer John Densmore decided to go for an earthier, softer sound on some of the tracks, which lends this Doors album an extra kind of beauty. Even Jim Morrison himself sounds more down-to-earth on this album, as his vocals on the first two Doors albums were very echoey, making him sound like he was a disembodied spirit, or recording his vocals inside a cave. Not that there's anything wrong with that---I love \\"The Doors\\" & \\"Strange Days\\"--- but Jim sounded on those first two albums like he was always floating in the clouds above his three musical co-horts. But on \\"Waiting For The Sun,\\" Jim's voice is warmer, not so echoey, and on definite equal footing in the mix with his bandmates, which is a plus.Great Doors songs are everywhere on \\"Waiting For The Sun\\"---the huge hit \\"Hello I Love You,\\" the beautiful \\"Love Street,\\" the bizarre \\"Not To Touch The Earth\\" (an extract from an even longer Doors composition, \\"The Return Of The Lizard King,\\" found on the live \\"In Concert\\" CD), the haunting \\"My Wild Love,\\" and other Doors classics like \\"The Unknown Soldier,\\" \\"Spanish Caravan,\\" and the terrific rocker, \\"Five To One.\\" Say what you want about Jim Morrison's strange lyrics & poetry, but give the man some credit---this guy definitely had a way with words, AND he had a monster voice & presence to match. He was the quintessential rock singer, and he is greatly missed. Ray Manzarek can stroke the keyboards like no one else on Earth (and NO ONE plays the organ as brilliantly as he does). Robby Krieger is a mean guitarist, serving up some incredibly memorable licks, and John Densmore is one of rock's finest drummers, whether slamming his drumkit like a man posessed, or just kicking back with a steady beat. I suppose \\"Waiting For The Sun\\" is also my favorite Doors album because it captures the band right smack in the middle of their lifespan, with two albums behind them and three more to go, and with so much life left in them as a great musical force. They rocked all the way to the end, in fact, right up until Morrison took his leave of planet Earth. But \\"Waiting For The Sun\\" is, I think, the band's masterpiece. It's an amazing Doors album filled with variety, feeling, and tremendous power. Pick it up! :-)
B00004U8H4|5.0|Pat Bateman is an intelligent, Harvard educated yuppie who has a sense for fasion and works on Wall Street. His life is centered around material things. He has to have the best of everything, and on many levels, he does. He tries his hardest to fit in, and in the most part, he succeeds. But in the back of his head, the sense of not being good enough in his high-class environment is eating away at him, and sends him into uncontrolable violent frenzies, that may or may not have just been dreamed up in his troubled brain, and never actually happened. Based on, and highly toned down from, Brett Easton Ellis' extremely graphic and controversial novel, American Psycho is a suspense/thriller that does not even come near the realm of subtlety (except when compared to the book). This film characterizes the lives of a pack of rich, young urban professionals (or Yuppies, if you rather), in a satirical way, but also does not make us forget that it is a suspense film. Their greed and disgust are their only emotions, but only seemingly more so in our protagonist. Some of the amusing little scenes (ex. Bateman and his friends bickering over who has the most tasteful business card) may just seem like interesting filler to the untrained eye, but when thought about deeply, makes you think about how mentally different these people are. If squeamish, I suggest you read the book first, to make the movie seem a little tamer. But if you want it more shocking and suspenseful, by all means, see the movie first. I did.

It gives them the attitude of &quot; I don't care what you think, I'm doing this the way I like it.

When Zaireeka came out and you had to assemble 4 CD players to play the album, it was a pretty clear indication the Flaming Lips were ready to get weirder and more experimental. But the results from Soft Bulletin to Yoshimi have been (inter)stellar and the former was deservedly NME's Record of the Year (and literally the last great record of the 20th Century based on its release date).<br />Buy this record if you're a fan. For some great video highlights of the band, check them out on the Web. Wah Wah.
B000002KNY|3.0|&quot;Fear of Music&quot;, the Talking Heads' third album, is a transition from the proto-punk stylings of the late seventies into the more groove-oriented eighties. The theme here is madness. David Byrne starts the journey off with the nonsensical anthem &quot;I Zimbra&quot;, and leads us through the album with a franticness unparallelled to anything ever put on record. In &quot;Cities&quot; he quickly names the cities he could live in, arbitrarily summing each one up, and then quickly moving on to the next, as though being chased. &quot;Animals&quot; finds him warning us that the animals are laughing at us behind our backs (&quot;They don't even know....What a joke is&quot;) and how they plan to revolt against us. Occasionally, he slows down. Byrne reveals in &quot;Heaven&quot;, a borderline ballad, that Heaven is really a bar where nothing ever happens, but this isn't a negative depiction. &quot;It's hard to imagine that nothing at all/ Could be so eciting, could be so much fun&quot;. This album falls in perfect sequence to the Heads' prior album &quot;More Songs about Buildings and Food&quot;, in which Byrne's character seemed overly obsessed with his job, his work.....here it seems to have driven him over the edge, and he plays the part beautifully.
B00006LSM3|4.0|This CD grows on you; it's bloody good stuff. It could almost be another Wilburys album to complete the set. What it is really is a swansong, an album of it. One of his best, no doubt about it. No collector of George's or ex-Beatles stuff can pass on this one; it's that good.<br />A really fresh breeze of music, especially when considered against all the crap they put out now.
B000002A3T|3.0|Regardless of what Pink Floyd was (or will be??) this is an enjoybale album. I do not put his CD in when I'm in the mood for \\"Pink Floyd\\", that is the time for DSOTM, Meddle, Animals, WYWH, even Final Cut. DB gets put in when I'm in that Enya, Van Morrison type mood. This is technically produced epic-style mellow album. No awe-inspiring lyrics, but no cheese either. But what do you expect? Just like most 60's and 70's era band, some the \\"soul\\" is lost with old age. Some give up, some continue. Not sure, but I'd assume the band was secondary (or thirdary) at that point in Gilmour, Wright and Mason's life(maybe almost hobbie-like?). Who can blame them after 4 decades of some of the greatest music ever and the rock-n-roll lifestyle they lived? It'd be nice if they put their lives on hold and throw out all the new technology & session players and dust off the Hammond, tube amps ,fenders, piano, and get some those 60's era synth-noise-making thing-a-ma-jigs and jam in a locked studio for a year and write songs. But they'd probably say \\"No Thanks, been there, done that\\". No Floyd magic here, but a nice album nonetheless.....

It should have had a warning label:  \\"PARENTAL ADVISORY -- DANTE'S INFERNO ON THIS MOVIE.\\"<br />The only character worth noting, applauding, and commiserating with is Matthew Lillard as Shaggy.  He has the voice and most of the characterizations nailed pat.<br />However, Freddie Prinze Jr. is astoundingly annoying as \\"Fred\\"...<br />I love Sarah Michelle Gellar in Buffy, but I cringe and wince to see what she has been reduced to here.  ... but this movie's banal plot, trite dialogue, and non-existant character development could not even give anyone room to do anything with this.<br />Velma...oh, my.  The joke with the glasses--one of the only few nods to the original series, along with Scooby Snacks--is forced and made me want to rip my hair out.  Her giddines of finding romantic interest near the end made me cover my eyes and shake my head with despair.<br />Scooby.  Where to start here.  The voice?  Ok, I'll give the movie credit for that.  The fart jokes?  Oh, WHY?!?  ...  And, quite frankly, the cartoon's version of Scooby looked more considerably dopey...this computer animated version doesn't have quite the screwy eyes the cartoon-counterpart had.<br />So...to recap.  Fred, a one-dimensional show-stealing sexist teams up with vacuous Daphne along with love-deprived attention-starved Velma, Shaggy, and Scooby to go to an island whose evil villain winds up being ...  Was it meant to be funny when you found out who it was?  Maybe, but the laughter was quite firmly suppressed by the amount of forced humor, bad plot, equally bad sets, and pain...lots of pain.  Sexual humor didn't belong in a cartoon, but Daphne makes it quite implict (yet painfully clear) that the ghost is doing something he shouldn't be.  The drug humor was particularly not wanted in what was originally a CHILDREN'S CARTOON...  Other liberties that were taken?  Let's see...the monsters on the island are REAL!  That never happened in the cartoon series.  Also, I don't recall any romantic interest ever being introduced either.<br />In the end, where do you stop?  Stop yourself by not bothering to watch this...<br />Matthew Lillard- I salute you and your devotion to your rendition of Shaggy...was particularly not wanted in what was originally a CHILDREN'S CARTOON...

0312265859|5.0|This was the funniest book I've ever read. One of the best of the Stephanie Plum series. I would highly recommend it and can't wait for number nine!!
0553282980|3.0|This book is a story about the life in a academy. It is interesting to see how the  different boys managed their school days .The main characters find a new way to express their feelings because of their new English teacher. He tells them to seize the day with poetry. I think it is understandable that some boys, above all Todd, don't understand their English teacher Mr Keating at first. It is interesting how he changes from a shy little boy to a boy who starts liking poetry and has his own opinion. I think the last scene is really typical of that. Todd is the only student who really takes part in defending Mr. Keating.<BR>Neil is also a character who is very important in the plot. The passion for poetry and acting is really refreshing. <BR>The end of this story was really surprising for me. I didn't  expect  Neil's suicide. I can't imagine how he could kill himself for his dream.<BR>It was an interesting book  but sometimes unimportant details are described too long.
B00004XOWM|1.0|After their first CD came out, i figurd Limp Bizkit would be a force to reckon with in years to come.  Their second CD wasn't bad either but i figured they would come back harder than ever.  Wow, was I wrong.  This is quite possibly one of the worst CD's i've ever considered buying.  Theyve almost totally abandoned their rock roots and gone completely rap.  It's not even as if they are good at rapping.  Rollin' is basically the hokey-pokey in a rap version and my generation is an excuse to say the word F*** as many times as possible.  Terrible lyrics, bad music, and the loss of what got them here in the first place make this album one of the worst post-debut album I've ever heard.
0553282980|5.0|I liked the book very much. It` s easy to read, interesting and realistic although I think that the end is too dramatic. The suicide of Neil is not  believable.<BR>Also the many different characters were a problem for me sometimes. I couldn't distinguish them all the time, especially the minor characters, for example Pitts or Meeks.<BR>I think the message of the book is \\"carpe diem\\"- Seize the day and that you should go your own way in life without letting yourself be influenced by others.
B000001DTM|5.0|Not only is this U2's best and most cohesive album, it is also one of the only true perfect albums released in the 90s. Coming after the critically unaccepted 'Rattle &amp; Hum,' U2 found a new, more &quot;European&quot; sound and struck gold. The album had two monster hits on it ('Mysterious Ways' and 'One') and had a few other successful singles ('The Fly', 'Who's Gonna Ride Your Wild Horses?' and 'Even Better Than The Real Thing'). Everything about 'Achtung Baby' works, from the new-found harsher sound and Bono's darker lyrical stance. The Edge's guitar is all over this album and is by far his most groundbreaking and imaginative work and the Clayon/ Mullen rhythm section is just as solid as ever. 'Achtung Baby' is something a fan of U2 or rock music in general should listen own, there's nothing to dislike about it. Album highlights include 'One', 'Until The End Of The World', 'The Fly', and 'Love Is Blindess'.
0553282980|3.0|I find the book very interesting and good. The book it's not too difficult to understand.<BR>It shows the life of some students in a private school, about their problems and their dreams. The message of it is to have an own opinion and that you have to do what you want. But the book shows us too, that there are people who have problems to realise that.<BR>The book it's a bit different from the movie.
B00004SYWZ|5.0|I have been a fan since 1984 and this is, by far and away, THE best album of theirs.  Every track on this CD is a gorgeous complilation of sounds, the pinnacle of which is Morten Harket's voice.  This is perhaps the first CD I've owned in which I love every song.  Any a-Ha fan must have this album.
0553282980|4.0|I find the book good, because you see what problems and dreams the students of Welton  School have. The book is not too difficult to understood. I think the message of it is that you have a own opinion. The book shows the real life. I find good that young people play the mean roles in the book.<BR>I think that the film is a bit more interesting, and so a bit different to the book.
B0000797IO|5.0|I don't normally write reviews, but after I read the Amazon Customer Review of  \\"The Good Girl\\" where the customer gave it only one star, listing 10 reasons not to see it, I had to step up to the plate.<br />First, in the defense of the \\"one star reviewer\\" if you normally ONLY like burp and fart plotless movies, then \\"The Good Girl\\" is not for you.  BUT, if you enjoy comedy, suspense and thought-provoking entertainment, this is your movie.  I actually rank \\"The Good Girl\\" as one of my top five favorite movies of the year.<br />Jennifer Aniston shows that she is more than a beautiful face and an actress who flawlessly portrays the quirky comedic style of her character \\"Rachel\\" on \\"Friends\\".  In \\"The Good Girl\\" Aniston's acting is Oscar-worthy to say the least.  She can pull off an authentic \\"Texan gal\\" southern accent as well as the body language of someone who feels the internal void of being trapped in an unfulfilling job and marriage.<br />Once you get passed being totally impressed by Aniston's performance (if you watch \\"Friends\\"), there is a unique and unpredictable story line that is packed full of humor and intrigue.  <br />Aniston's character stumbles upon a new \\"love interest\\" with a male co-worker and given the fact that she married, her life begins to snowball out of control because of the affair.<br />Although this movie has been described as \\"dark and melancholy\\", (which I think is a bit harsh), it's fresh, it's different and I laughed out loud several times.  It is a definite \\"must see\\"!
0553282980|5.0|The novel deals with a lot of good ideas. It shows that we have to live with our hearts spontaneously, and not run it like a conveyer belt! There are so many things which are important and which we forget so easily in our all-day lives.<BR>The boys all have their own problems! And these are mostly problems about how to live their lives That can also be our own concern! And so the book is likely to touch everybody, I think.<BR>I can really recommend this extraordinary book!
B000067CPX|3.0|This album amazed me with alot of ingenuitive music. There is alot of smart guitar riffs ,rhythms, and rymes. Its still got that genuine Chilli Pepper feel but it differs a bit from there previous albums. Theres a few great songs a few medium songs and some terrible songs. This cd is a good buy but it won't be our best cd.
0553282980|4.0|This book was a nice experience for me. It was easy to read because it was tense until the end, and the story is close to reality, it is believable. I think the message is that we should have the courage to stand up to our opinion, that we should go our own way and that we should be ourselves. It shows the influence of young people and all that makes me think about a lot of things. We should try to realise our dreams and fight for our rights. I was moved  to see how the parents of the students and the other adults behave towards young people They think that they are not able to make their own decisions and to act reasonably  and that was really frightening for me.
0345339711|5.0|The Two Towers is a follow up to The Fellowship of The Ring.  Although The Fellowship was an outstanding book which sets up the rest of the story, it can't compete with The Two Towers.  With far more action and different sides of the story to view from the reader is engaged in the action resulting in anticipation and wonder.<br />The Two Towers is well written allowing an easy read for people of all ages.  Although it is written in a different style than that of non-fantasy books, it is still written for an easy understanding.  With a well devised structure and an effective flow in the way The Two Towers is written, the reader is more likely to stay interested in the story and want to read on.  With such a detailed plot J.R.R Tolkien paid great attention to the description of each scene and what is going on to allow the reader to picture what is happening in their mind with extreme detail.<br />Of course without a good story, there is no way a book could succeed.  It doesn't matter how well it is written: if the story isn't interesting then there is no way the reader is going to keep reading.  With a well thought out plot and many details to the story, The Two Towers can get a little confusing.  There is always an appendix (located in The Return of the King) to look at if something is a little confusing.  This allows the reader to stay with the story and not get lost.<br />The way The Two Towers is written and such an engaging plot, Tolkien created a masterpiece that will keep even people who aren't into fantasy stories entertained.  The attention to detail allowing for an easy read for people of all ages, The Two Towers will be a book read for decades to come.
0553282980|4.0|I find the book very interesting and well written and it's not too difficult to understand for somebody who learns English as a second language.<BR>Thr novel shows the life of some students in a private school and deals with their problems, frustrations and their dreams. The message of the novel is to have an opinion of one's own and to do what you want. But the book shows us too that there are people who have problems to realise their ideas so that they can't help resigning and giving up <BR>The novel is a bit different from the movie.
B0000024IE|4.0|This is the most uptempo of all PE's albums. An excellent follow up to It takes a nation.. Very potent lyrics which sound like a revolution on wax. I recommend this one is you are into earlier PE and even some Early Ice Cube and NWA.
0553282980|4.0|I enjoyed reading \\"Dead Poets Society\\", because I think it's a very special book. The topic is not usual though. <BR>Sometimes the story was a bit boring. But when I had finished the book I was very thoughtful. I couldn't understand the reaction of Mr. Nolan and Mr. Perry because I liked Mr. Keating and his style of teaching. His ideas of enjoying life and trying to be extraordinary were very interesting. He could also make me think about my own life and how to live it. He showed his students that they had only one life and that they had to bear responsibility for it. And I think that's right.<BR>The novel can also show parents what can happen if they tell their children how to live. They shouldn't decide about their children's life.
B00006J3T4|4.0|If I were to try and sum this album up in a single word, it would be eclectic. If I could rate it fractionally, it would earn 4½ Stars.<br />This is an album for the aficionado, not the mainstream rocker. Each track is like a visual photograph. There are no hard riffs from the Dire Straits \\"Sultans of Swing\\" days, but some very excellent guitar work and wonderful lyrics to be found here. The stylings are a blend of styles reminiscent of Bob Wills and the Texas Playboys to older J. J. Cale and pure Mark Knopfler doing folk and classic ballads.<br />As of this writing, \\"Marbletown\\" is my favorite. Listening to the lyrics, you can easily picture a down on their luck vintage hobo camping out for the night in a cemetery. Absolutely wonderful. I qualified the choice, because at other times I found the swing rhythm of \\"Daddy's Gone to Knoxville\\" entrancing and \\"Coyote\\" simply captivating. \\"Quality Shoe\\" is just a wonderful piece of music. At other times, other cuts have grabbed my fancy.<br />Some people may find this album an acquired taste. Personally, I feel the taste is worth acquiring. Knopfler's understated vocals serve to underscore his guitar virtuosity. While he does not have the blazing speed of John McLaughlin, his phrasing is dead on for every style. Some guitarists may be known for a particular style but here, Mark Knopfler demonstrates a command of a range of styles, all brilliantly executed.<br />If there is a drawback to this album, it is the spacing between tracks. I have nothing against silence, but the gaps between tracks are too long. Personally, I'd like to see this remastered with half the length between tracks.<br />I admit I miss the sounds of a hard rockin' Dire Straits, but with this album Mark Knopfler demonstrates he is more than up the challenge of standing on his own. If you love guitar music, get it. If you love lyrical ballads, get it. If you're a fan of blues, swing or folk, get it. You won't be disappointed. If you're a hard rocker, try it... you will still appreciate the guitar work.
0553282980|3.0|I like poems very much! In this book there were quite a lot. The story is exciting, romantic and sometimes also funny. Of course I also see the tragic side of the novel. It shows a good way to live on's life: Carpe Diem!
B000026OHN|4.0|I very much enjoy this recording. It's one of the more listenable WTC's as Sviatoslav - galvanised-steel-fingers - Richter is playing on the edge of his remarkable abilities. And very musically at that, too. He really forges the WTC into one of the highlights of musical unity. Drawback is the far from perfect sound quality, but that should never EVER prevent one from buying this album.<br />Remember though, there is more to the WTC than Richter's interpretation. I began to fully appreciate the pieces when I had listened to the Gould and Perahia-sets as well. And the definitive recording? There is no. And there will not be.
0553282980|3.0|I think the book Dead Poets Society is an interesting book because the story is about the life of a good teacher. And I think the reader can feel how hard the school for the students!  <BR>For me  Todd Anderson isan important person because at the start Todd is a very angry person who doesn`t want to go to this school because his brother  attended this school and he was the very best, and I think for Todd that is difficult because he thinks the teacher compares him with his brother. <BR>The new teacher Mr. Keating is a special one and the first school day for Mr. Keating is also the first school day for Todd. Todd is in the first lesson very shy and Mr. Keating sees that and he helps Todd. Todd must go to the blackboard and he must read his poem to the other students, but he reads very quitely and Mr. Keating says to Tood that he must read the poem very loud. And after that Todd has a lot of self-confidence.
B00005JLS0|4.0|Starring Sandra Bullock and Hugh Grant you know this one will be good...<BR>Another romantic comedy set once again in New York (apparently the town where all the action is), Bullock and Grant take their stab at the ever-so-popular romantic comedy to good results.<br />THE STORY:<br />Lucy Kelson (Bullock) is an activist/environmentalist/all-around defender of the little guy lawyer who takes a job as the corporate attorney for billionaire playboy/nice-guy-but unintentional capitalist pig George Wade as an attempt to save the community center that is condemned in favor of a development project by Wade's huge conglomerate.  Naturally on opposite sides of the fence at first, as the year goes by both Lucy and George slowly find themselves becoming interdependent on one another for everything as the sparks slowly but surely start to fly between them.<br />THE ANALYSIS:<br />This is NOT your connect-the-dots type of love story which really appeals to me (being a connoisseur of the genre).  Yes of course you know how the movie ends and yes some of the inevitable plot twists occur but it's the little things that set it apart that make this movie stand out from others in the genre.  Bullock's rival for George is actually a pretty decent gal and not the stereotypical you-know-what.  Plus, the \\"little things\\" that occur during George and Lucy's relationship as it develops are actually well played out.  One scene that stands out in my mind is the little \\"lunch business meeting\\" the two had which was strictly business and professional but well played out as to give that \\"they're gonna hook up\\" vibe.  Overall you should come out of this movie pleased.<br />BEST SCENES:<br />1. Stuck in the bathroom<br />2. \\"Gotta go and it's rush hour\\"/trailor home<br />3. The aforementioned lunch business meeting<br />4. Extreme Tennis<br />5. Chinese take out<br />VERDICT:<br />Overall, you'll get a nice kick out of Grant and Bullock's take on the romantic comedy.  This movie of course works best for couples on a date or the younger crowds looking for a flick to spend the night or weekend away on.  You should come out of this saying, \\"that was cute\\" or \\"that was a good one.\\"  Besides, it's Sandra Bullock and Hugh Grant so you know it's good.<br />Highly Recommended

B000002U82|5.0|A pesar de que este album tiene casi mi edad, cuando lo escuch  en 1993 qued atnito por su estilo tan adelantado a su poca. Estoy esperando impacientemente el lanzamiento en formato DVD-Audio, el cual seguramente mantendr esa calidad a la que nos ha acostumbrado Pink Floyd.
B000006TRV|5.0|this is a good album. It packs songs like hey you, mother, another brick in the wall pt. 2, and comfortably numb. This album may be too depresing for some (just watch the movie and you'll see)<BR>but it's high on my list
0345413377|5.0|I've been moved to write this view by reading over the one-star reviews, most of which are by people who are overly literal-minded and object with the subject matter and let their difficulties and dislikes spill over onto the book (and series) overall.<BR>I could gush and use all kinds of superlatives followed by many exclamation points, but instead I'll only write that here is a series of books that dares to be about something, which is rare enough. And what's more... he succeeds. This has to be one of the most upsetting and necessary endings (after the shock wears off, think about it -- the story is heading there the entire time) to a series in memory. A complicated and satisfying ending to a masterwork series of fantasy fiction.
B00000DHR0|5.0|I could not wait to buy this CD when it came out.  Celine is such a charismatic singer that I did not need to hear if I liked it, I knew it was a winner.  My son and I listened to this music all year long,as the true Spirit of Christmas should endure in the hearts of people. I do not have a CD player in my car so we were blessed with the tape version as well. There is not one song on this CD that is a disappointment, as Celine puts her whole heart and soul into every recording.  It is our favorite Christmas CD. The CD is so perfectly balanced with gentleness to the robust and all of the in between. This CD brings such joy to the listener, as is the intent Celine always seems to hold as the priority of her music.  Mrs. Symmington
B00005B36H|5.0|Tool is probly one of the best and creative band's out in the mainstreem and they should deserve a lot of credit for beign different then the other Nu Metal [...]. This album really showed how talented this band really is. The drumming is just amazing for example Ticks&Leachs. Maynards vocal's really stand out on this record. The whole cd is just a pure masterpiece and i can't see how anyone can call this boring unless you listen to NU mEtal or Grindcore. This is a must for anyone who listen's to some good Metal.
B000067CPX|5.0|When I first heard this album I was dumbfounded. I was like where is the funk? where are the wild guitars and bass? Dispite a couple songs like \\"Can't Stop\\" and \\"By the Way\\" you could have tricked me into thinking this wasn't the Peppers. I was disappointed. I wanted something to jump around to, like Blood Sugar Sex Magik! So at first glance this album was a disappointment... But take another look. This CD is great to cruise to with your windows down on a hot day. You can just be laid back in your house and be chillin' with your friends. Tracks like \\"This is the Place\\", \\"The Zephyr Song\\", and \\"Minor Thing\\" could accomplish this. I love the ballads, they get you in the mood to relax or maybe you'll think of someone you love. That happened to be with the song \\"Venice Queen\\", which might be my favorite RHCP song period. Anthony has done great on this album. His vocals and lyrics are more than they ever have before, and they have actualy depth. I believe this albumis for the spiritual type because I think this album was a spiritual album for the band. Your not wasting a penny buying this album. Some other of my picks are \\"Don't Forget Me\\", \\"Warm Tape\\", and \\"Midnight\\". Also check out \\"Throw away your television\\" that song jsut has something about it!!!
0316666343|2.0|First I will say that I truly liked how the novel was written.  I like the way Sebold described Susie's thoughts, the sexual moments, the anger, and other emotions each character went through.  But what I didn't like was that the book was great in the beginning and at the end but the middle was just boring.  It starts you off thinking what an amazing book this is going to be, but then as you read on the book tends to drag.  Which was really hard for me to read but then as you are getting closer to the end you finally just want to know what the hell happened to that Mr. Harvey.  Let me tell you, it isn't that exciting.  To me it is more far fetch then real.  Speaking of far fetch, lets talk about another Ghost movie waiting to happen.  Susie coming into Ruth's body to be able to continue a 14 year old crush she had with a boy.  I am just not feeling that moment.  I will admitt the way Sebold wrote it was great but just the fact of it truly happening is bizarre.  I am very positive and negative about the way Sebold wrote about heaven because I see heaven to be a place of love and just full time joy.  In Susie's case she wanted to get out of there and be back on Earth. Why couldn't Susie what heaven offers her and that there was no way of returning on Earth as Susie.  It reminds me of the movie What dream may come.  So I recommend the novel to read but just don't be as excited as other make the book to be.  It is some nice reading and very entertaining.
1587990717|5.0|Loved it!<br />Very thought provoking (dare I say life changing) book.<br />Thanks,<BR>---Freddy
0316666343|2.0|I started reading this book because so many people had told me it was an outstanding novel.  When I started reading the first few pages, I will admitt it was pretty darn good.  The way the author wrote about her rape and the struggle.  I could almost feel her pain.  The book also touched me personally because I am not much older than Susie and the thought of being rape to a teenage girl terrifies me.  But as I read on, the book got more far fetch. It started to become prolonged and it was harder for me to want to stay up and read the book.  There are parts in the novel that caught my attention but then there would be the chapters that were like a dry dessert.  The ending where Susie goes into Ruth's body was just crazy to me.  I believe that the dead are aound us especially people we love but to come into another's body and have a sexual moment with a long lost love is just too crazy.  The way Sebold wrote the description was outstanding but just too far fetch. After that I just wanted to get the book finished and find out what happened to Mr. Harvy.  Trust me it wasn't so interesting then I thought.  So readers, I say read the book if you really want to read about a girl who wishes she was on earth.  I agree it was emotional about I just didn't like it being so long and boring in the middle.  But do read the book, you might have a different opinion than me.
B00005JKDR|5.0|This is one of the greatest kids' stories to come out in years. The plot and subject matter are great, the acting is wonderful, and the animation is impeccable. As great as it is for children, the story has enough allusions and is simply well done enough for adults to have a great time watching as well. My wife and I consider it one of our favorites.<br />The DVD itself has some great features. The behind-the-scenes looks and interviews with the people responsible for making the movie are a great insight. I did think that the special features were a bit difficult to navigate, however, and the animations between menus were too long. That's a minor grip, however, on a spectacular movie and DVD.

0345349571|3.0|September 2011  Further update: After now rereading this book yet again and reading the source material on which much of this book is based, as well as the sources behind the sources, including the chronicles written in French, I can say that while Tuchman's writing and organization is remarkable, the book is not very accurate, but includes much that was propaganda and rumor added much later in history than the 14th century, e.g., that Charles VI of France had \\"a bland, impassive face, mirror of a shallow soul\\" (he was probably schizophrenic, and lack of affect is a symptom of schizophrenia) or that Charles' wife, Isabella of Bavaria, was wanton and had many lovers (there is no evidence of this from contemporaneous sources and no suggestion of this until the 17th century).  Still a great read, just not really history.  ------------------------  Update:  Fifth time seems to be the charm but, of course, before tackling this book again I've read about two dozen other books on the time period, which definitely makes this one more manageable.  In other words, this isn't a beginner book, as Tuchman's effort to be inclusive and comprehensive can get really confusing.  History doesn't keep itself down to logical plot lines and a limited cast of characters, and Tuchman covers everybody, even some of the more minor players.  The book still bogged down for me in the same places it originally did -- the first half, which covers such well-known events as the Hundred Years War and the Black Death, is definitely more interesting than the second, which focuses more on events in Germany and Italy, particularly the Pope's battles with the Viscontis.  If Amazon would let me revise my rating, I'd probably upgrade this to four stars, at least for anyone with some familiarity with the history of the middle ages.  If you are new to this time period, start with Thomas Costain's books and come back to this one when the overwhelming cast of characters won't seem so, well, overwhelming.  --------------------------------------------------------------  My original review:  I've tried reading this book repeatedly over the last two years and, although the material is interesting, just find it a slog.  Tuchman presumes a lot of knowledge about the 14th century on the part of the reader which, combined with the often dense writing, makes it difficult to get through.  Tuchman's clever twist is to focus on the life of one French nobleman.  This should make the narrative more personal, but frequently results in portions of history, especially outside England and France, feeling short-changed or forced, and making the narrative difficult to follow.  If you have some basic understanding of the middle ages in France or England and can get through it, though, it gives a great overall impression of what life in 14th century Europe must have been like.
0679721037|4.0|HIroshima is an equsite book. It details 6 survivors of the Atom Bomb at the end of World War Two. The book outlines these survivors' lives and how they helped their fellow men. The story shows a great deal of humanity, and how even when all seems lost there is still hope in the world. I recomend this book for Teenagers and above due to the fact of some graphic details of the injuries resulting from the Bomb. Hersey is a great author!
0316779989|1.0|A writer of any caliber, with any skill, would not need to sink to the depths of Sedaris to make a point.  There is nothing funny about killing infants or using the mentally or physically disabled to make a satirical point.  Have we, as a society, lost all our sensitivity?  This book is quite sick.  Its definitely not funny!
B000002J20|5.0|This double album is very good.  A four movement piece?  Only the first song (The Revealing...) and the last song (Ritual) seem to have any link at all.  The second and especially the third song (The Ancient) go off into another tanget.  The last four minutes of Ritual links the first song together with the last.  Of all the songs which require a length of 20 minutes plus is Ritual.  The other three songs seem to be a little long.  Eight minutes of the 20 minute The Remembering is awesome.  The Ancient goes on too long.  Ritual is definitely the best song on the album.  If Yes were to take the first track, eight minutes of the 2nd, erase the three and end with the entire fourth track, it would be one unbelievable single cd. All in all a great album, but not there best.  Close to the Edge and Relayer are better.  I gave this album five stars because anything by Yes deserves five stars.  Yes in my opinion is the most underrated band in the history of rock n' roll.  Why these guys are not in the hall of fame is tragic.  But maybe they are too good for the hall of fame.
0553282980|4.0|I enjoyed reading \\"Dead poets society\\", because I think it's a very special book. The topic is not usual. <BR>Sometimes the story was a bit boring. But when I finished the book I was very thoughtful. I couldn't understand the reaction of Mr. Nolan and Mr. Perry because I liked Mr. Keating and his style of teaching. His ideas of enjoy life were very interesting. He could also make me thinking about my own life and how to live it. He showed the people that they have only one life and that they have to enjoy it. And I think that's right.<BR>This film can also show parents what can happen when they tell their children how to live. They shouldn't decide about their children's life.
B000006TSC|3.0|Peter Bardens' last album with Camel (1978) sounds like a desperate attempt to grab increased record sales and stardom.  The songs are more pop than usual, and there's only one instrumental (Camel albums usually have at least two instrumentals for every song with vocals).  The band members aren't great singers, and they're worse lyricists, so they're not playing to their strengths.  Ex-Caravan bassist Richard Sinclair brings a catchy dose of the Caravan sound to &quot;Down on the Farm&quot;, but the annoying lyrics undercut the song.  The title cut is a pretty love song.  The best tracks are &quot;Echoes&quot; and the one instrumental, &quot;The Sleeper&quot;, which is reminiscent of Camel's earlier work.  Andy Latimer provides a fine guitar solo on &quot;Summer Lightning&quot;, which just makes up for a mediocre song.  &quot;You Make Me Smile&quot; and &quot;Rainbow's End&quot; are just embarrassing.  This is a 2-1/2 star album, the weakest of the half-dozen Camel albums I've heard to date.<br />(1=poor  2=mediocre  3=pretty good  4=very good  5=phenomenal)
B00007E8V4|5.0|You may think that with they're 3rd CD they would be getting old..but its just the opposite actually.  This CD is really great.  Its one of those songs that u can put on and then just sit and listen to the whole thing through over and over again. I love every single song on this CD and it is definetly not a dissapointment. Once you have already have 2 hit CD's out (system of a down, and toxicity) sometimes its hard to top. but i'll say that system of a down did a great job and is still going strong. if u dont have this album...u MUST have it- its probably one of my most favorite albums of all time.
B0000633T6|4.0|I was expecting more of a thriller.  Spy Game turned out to be far more cerebral than action-packed.  It offered interesting insight into the CIA, foreign relations and espionage.  Redford and Pitt gave solid performances as mentor and protege in a world where the choices are neither clear nor easy.  As someone else said, this is a movie you need to watch carefully, otherwise it is easy to get lost.
B00006RU5B|5.0|Chris Cornell is one of the best rock singers/songwriters ever, and this is his best effort since Louder Than Love.  I remember well coming home from Cellophane Square with the Screaming Life record (my first Soundgarden album), excitedly putting it on my turntable, and jumping off of furniture while Nothing To Say thundered through my speakers.  Now I'm a quite a bit older and a dad.  Life is good, but Audioslave has me pining for the days of crowd surfing at the Paramount.  Thank God Cornell has found such an excellent band to collaborate with.  The Rage guys just sound awesome.  After losing Andrew Wood, Kurt, and Layne, let's hope Chris is in it for the long haul.
B00006F7S4|5.0|This is a wonderful album, spacious and haunting, with beautiful spare arrangements and carefully crafted lyrics.  Reminds me why I fell in love with Beck after hearing &quot;Mutations&quot;, then felt betrayed by &quot;Stereopathetic Soulmanure&quot;.  &quot;Sea Change&quot; has a similar moody and introspective vibe to &quot;Mutations&quot;, but this album holds together more consistently from start to finish.<br />Not everybody wants consistency from Beck -- if you're looking for Beck's next great pop/funk hit, you won't find it here.  A couple tracks remind me of being a kid, laying on the floor listening to Gordon Lightfoot LPs on my parents' stereo.  Or some of Neil Young's early solo stuff.  Check out &quot;Paper Tiger&quot; and see what you think.  Gamble a few bucks on what may be one of the great albums of the decade.
6303407188|5.0|At last, the whole (shocking!) story of Edward D. Wood, Jr. I enjoyed everything, from the acting down to the musical score (fans of \\"Dracula\\" will notice that movie's opening theme plays in several scenes). Johnny Depp is a hoot as Ed Wood, and Martin Landau absolutely shines as Bela Lugosi---he certainly deserved the Ocsar he won for the role.<br />The film is by turns hilarious and sad. There are loads of great one-liners (\\"Yes, but if you take that ... and put a star in it, then you've got something!\\") and other endearingly funny moments. Landau's portrayal of Lugosi provides most of the pathos, showing us the tragic decline of a man who tried his best to work until the very end.<br />\\"Filmmaking is not about the little details. It's all about the big picture!\\" Tim Burton has done a wonderul job with both in this movie.
B00005LC1H|5.0|Just get it.  That's all I can say.  <BR>    I first saw Fawlty Towers several years ago and became hooked...no matter how many times you have seen the individual episodes, they never seem to lose their humor.  My only complaint is that I spent the $90 on the video box set before this came out, but even that is money well spent...sometimes nothing will do to watch but Basil Fawlty (played by the hysterical, and at the risk of making the sexiness quotient of the male leads a major factor in all my reviews, enormously sexy and handsome John Cleese.)<BR>    I very much enjoyed the extra features, particularly the interviews and the clip montages (\\"Perfect Marriage\\" was my favorite, I think.) All your favorite quotes, in one place.  If I had one complaint, it would be there were not enough features, but I don't think I would have enough until the cast shows up in my living room (one disappointment, though, was the outtakes: it seemed nothing more than some stuff filmed by the BBC during a \\"making of\\" special).  Also, commentary by the whole cast together would have been fun, but that's not always possible.<BR>    Every one of these episodes is a comedy gem.  Just do yourself a favor, and go buy it.  You absolutely will not regret it.
B0000507OD|5.0|I've seen &quot;Citizen Kane&quot; dozens of times over the years, and had a general idea of who the film was really about (Hearst) and the controversy it created. After watching &quot;The Battle Over Citizen Kane,&quot; however, I now feel that I have a much better understanding not only of the movie itself, but the full story of the two men locked in battle over it---Orson Welles and William Randolph Hearst.<br />This documentary provides a generous amount of personal information about both men, and comments from experts in relevant fields (Hearst biographers, etc.) as well as people who knew Welles personally. If you're a fan of &quot;Citizen Kane,&quot; this companion piece is not to be missed.
B00005MP58|5.0|This is quite simply a wonderful film adaptation of a wonderful book.  While I agree with other reviewers that sometimes the sound quality in particular is not great (don't try to run the sound through your home theatre sound system-the volume has to go so high to hear the dialogue that the music will blast you from your chair)I personally don't care that much because of all the great things about the movie-Colin Firth, to name one!<BR>    What I like best here-besides the terrific casting (I particularly enjoyed Julia Sawalha, Absolutely Fabulous' stuffy Saffy, flouncing about and flirting outrageously) is that it manages to keep you in suspense, just as the book does, even after repeated readings and viewings.  Intellectually we know that Elizabeth will get her Mr. Darcy, but we still wait with bated breath for the final proposal.<BR>    Add that to breathtaking scenery, witty dialogue, and characters who leap from the screen, and you have one lovely afternoon's viewing, even if it didn't include a wet-shirted Colin (which it gratifyingly does.)<BR>    I can watch this one over and over and never get tired of it.
B00005JL2O|3.0|I laughed a bit at this movie, but it just wasn't as much fun as I was expecting. The extras were top-notch, though.
B000021YQV|5.0|This is what fans of heavy music need to be listening to.  SoAD's first cd was just incredible, with explorative guitar riffs and outstanding lyrics, but System beat the sophomore jinx with an even more amazing disc.  Most band's 2nd cd (...), but this is one of the few bands that have talent.  Serj's vocals are awesome, he can go from a polital tune to a song about pogo sticks.  Finally, a band with worthwhile political views (Zach de la Rocha (...)).  even if you dont agree with system, they still have a sense of 'normalness' to them that is tolerable.  i respect every member of the band, and think every1 has the right to their own opinion. hey, even i dont agree with some of system's views, and they still give a good name to \\"political rock\\"  I went to see system at ozzfest, and banged my head to every second of every song, loved every minute of it, woke up the next morning, and couldn't move my head.  But, hey, for system it was worth it.
B00006ALGL|5.0|The days when Rice fronted the now defunct tedious Juniper seem a long way off. It is hard to believe the same Damien Rice made `O' one of the best-kept secrets of 2002.  Recorded at his house and friends' places in Dublin over the course of two years, it sounds neither lo-fi or over polished but somehow he has created a happy medium without ever getting swallowed up by the principle of either recording styles.   <BR>The names of the opening duo, 'Delicate' and 'Volcano', sum up 'O's gentle appeal and emotional intensity; where strings nestle down with acoustic guitars and Rice shares the limelight with singing soulmate Lisa Hannigan. This album has some for the best crafted song of last year and has rarely off my stereo. I have played this album to a number of people and they are amazed by it's beauty. It's an album that gets sadder with every listen and even more beautiful and but better too.

B00005ATZT|5.0|I am torn between four stars and five stars. Generally, to earn five stars from me, it has to be a movie that I could see many times, even in one week. This movie does not qualify for that. Although it is very good, I can only watch it once every six months or so. However, since it really is good, it should qualify as five stars, especially compared to other four star movies.<br />The acting is good, the cinematography is great, the transfer is very good (especially considering it was one of the early DVDs to hit the market) and the special effects are good enough that you hardly notice them (which is what I consider good -- you don't notice that they are there).<br />The suspense is high in that you don't know if he will get caught (no, I won't tell you). There are small surprises at every turn, but not enough depth to bear rapid repeat viewings. Still, it is one of the modern day classics, so give it a try.

057506885X|5.0|I loved this book! I would not advise it for someone who is not yet aquainted with the Discworld, but it is otherwise marvelous. The tale was short but made up for it with page after page of spectacular illustrations by Paul Kidby.<br />The Last Hero brings together Carrot and Rincewind who, to my knowledge, have never before shared an adventure, along with gods, wizards, priests and of course heros. Altogether, throughly spiffy

B00005JL96|1.0|Shame on you, Disney, for lowering your standards.  I expect better!  Shame on me for assuming I could count on Disney films to present wholesome qualities to my two small children.<br />Disney presents a storyline far from wholesome in this film.  Lilo attacks another little girl, hitting and biting her.  She does apologize to the girl later and the girl refuses to accept her apology.  She doesn't mind the adults looking after her, and behaves like a BRAT.  Her older sister, and &quot;example&quot; runs in front of a car which honks at her.  She, in turn, kicks the car and yells at the driver to &quot;watch where he's going.&quot;  Now there's anger management.  Lilo and her sister, Nani, stick their tongues out at each other, yell and scream at each other, and resolve problems by screaming into pillows.  Then, there is Stitch...out of control and destructive.<br />I spent the first half of this movie saying to my very impressionable 3-year old, &quot;Now that wasn't very nice.  That wasn't very nice either.  We don't talk that way to each other.&quot;  At that point, the movie was turned off.<br />This movie was a Christmas present.  It has been put away and I don't know that I will allow it to resurface for a very long time, if ever.  And next time Disney comes out with a movie, I will preview it for subject quantity.
630512762X|5.0|I have just recently seen Face/Off on tv.  I can't tell you how great I thought it was.  Everything about the movie was unbelieveable and the action was awesome.  John Woo is the best director there is.  Lets face it, though, no one goes to see a John Woo movie for the fantastic plot or wholesome banter.  You go to see the best gunfights and combat money can buy.  Although this movie did have some intriguing melodrama, where Travolta gets with Cage's wife.  This is my current favorite movie, and it probably would be one of your favorites, too.  Defintely buy this movie.  Just do it.  It'll make you more attractive to women.  Trust Me.
B00005JKQZ|2.0|I think this would be a great movie if anyone other than Mr. Crowe was the leading charactor.  He is too into himself, and that leaks through all of his charactors, which are always the same person.  He obviously has no depth or versatility.
B00006WUWN|4.0|This isn't a review about the actual movie, but the DVD itself. The Austin Powers Movie: Goldmember, was wonderful and very funny. However, the DVD does not live up to the movie. The DVD has several wonderful features in it: The Infinifilm opition which allows you to watch the movie and access speical features that tells you about how the movie was made and the concept of everything. However, there were several features in the DVD that made the DVD worse. First off, unlike most DVD's the DVD was in the Full Screen Version, which cuts off part of the movie itself. Second off, the movie doesn't have subtitles at all, which makes it hard for anyone that can't hear well or that don't know English to watch the movie.<br />Pros:<BR>It's Austin Powers<BR>Infinifilm Features<br />Cons:<BR>No Subtitles<BR>Full Screen Version
B000062YAZ|5.0|the #1 heavy metal cd of all time--hands down
0345448898|2.0|Pullman is a master of story telling and imagery. The subject matter, however, is not appropriate for children despite the book's cover which recommends the book for ages 10 and up. My objections? The heroine, Lyra, sets off to rescue her dear friend who has been kidnapped and is horrified when she learns that he was kidnapped for a religious experiment in which children are surgically separated from their daemons (external manifestations of their souls) which either kills the children or leaves them in a perpetual zombie-like state. The experiment has been performed countless times under the direction of . . . Lyra's mother. Lyra views her father with a mixture of admiration and fear. <br />This is a book that will teach children to be fearful, not hopeful. It will teach them that they are alone, not part of a family or community. It will teach them to distrust the adults in their lives, not turn to them for advice or assistance. Because the imagery is fabulous, the lessons are more readily learned.
B00006CXXU|5.0|I've always been a big fan of Christina Aguilera... however, i disagree with her releasing &quot;Dirrty&quot; as her first single after her well overdue second album. It totally misrepresents her cd! The rest of the songs are absolutely awesome, and the ballads are so beautiful that I cried while hearing &quot;Im OK.&quot; She has grown SO MUCH over her time off from being in the public eye, and it's impossible not to respect her as both an extroadinary singer and artist after listening to this album. I RECOMMEND THIS
B000066NW0|4.0|Anyone who would classify this as &quot;punk&quot; has a screw loose. Avril ain't Johnny Rotten and &quot;Complicated&quot; ain't &quot;Anarchy in the UK&quot;  ...  but this is fun bubble gum pop in the vein of the Go Go's.  Way better than Brittney Spears (puke).  I'd let my kids listen to it. ;-)
B00005JLS0|5.0|For all the hype of Maid in Manhattan, compared to Two Weeks Notice it is a \\"disaster.\\"  In Two Weeks Notice a relationship and bond between George(Hugh Grant) and Lucy(Sandra Bullock) develop throughout a period of time.  They began to understand and respect one another.  Whereas the two leads in Maid in Manhattan shared no spark or relationship beyond one conversation at a decent length and a night of passion where lies and deceit are tied in between.  The comedy and romance in Two Weeks Notice were witty and believable.  Hugh Grant and Sandra Bullock delivers a great performance and has wonderful timing during either the comedic tiffs and bickering or the sentimental monologues.  I would definitely recommend Two Weeks Notice to other viewers and I highly advise viewers to buy the movie when it comes out on DVD or VHS.
B00003CY0V|2.0|Oh dear, oh dear, oh dear. This movie is awful on so many levels. It could have been just another forgettable, below-average cyber-action movie, until it raised the bile to the edge of my throat by having the unmitigated nerve to try and be clever and furthermore paint the villian as some sort of complex moral hero.<br /> Travolta chews the scenery as yet another in the long line of devilishly evil cyber-terrorist, but there's little he can do in a role bound and gagged by pure cliche. Jackman is forgettable as the blackmailed computer hacker (if only all nerds looked so buff), and his accent is a constant distraction (why couldn't he just be an Australian hacking expert?) Berry is pure eye-candy, hung on a string and paraded around to divert the attention of the male demographic from the plot holes large enough to drive convoys through. Don Cheadle. Jeez, talk about wasting a great actor. I could go on. Vinnie Jones, for instance, used as just another hackneyed evil cohort. But now I'm starting to depress myself by recalling more of the film than I'd prefer to.<br /> If you insist on not avoiding this movie like the plague, at most wait for it to appear on tv, watch the first 10 minutes (that's where the extra star comes from, and I'm being extremely generous), then turn it off and forget about it for the rest of your life. Consider it an act of charity for your intelligence.
0066214122|3.0|The first book by Michael Crichton I watched adapted for television was the Andromeda Strain. His stories are filled with intriguing technological concepts that usually end up teaching a lesson of how manmade technology does not mix well with nature. There are parts to the book that left me wondering why certain things would happen. Crichton does an excellent job of explaining concepts, but still falls into that trap of a &quot;bug&quot; in the program to make explanations short. overall its a good read.

0876855575|4.0|Yeah, I probably understood the idea of the \\"noble drunk\\" before I read this. I may have even been one; in a manner of speaking. I was definitely drunk. Buckowski likes to read and drink and tell what's on his mind. These qualities make him a clear-cut role model for the aspiring drunken hipster, as he sets a template for behavior that is amoral, yet ethical. He doesn't stand for phony-baloney golden rulism, just honesty and willfullness. In a way, he can be read as a sort of Buddhist in the way he recognizes his own id as well as the ids of others. This book is simply one of the best chapters in what is really one gigantic work that spanned his lifetime.
B00005B36H|5.0|The only bad thing about Lateralus is that it inspires people to write overlong reviews. Let's face it, kids, here's the scoop: Lateralus was released in May 2001 and is still in my car. Anyone else feeling me? You don't need to be a hyperintellectual or an occultist to appreciate this band, you just need to love music. Danny Carey's drums sound like the Thunder of God. Maynard sings each song as if it's his last. Justin Chancellor's low end rumbles and grates like some dark beast waiting under our collective beds. Adam Jones picks his spots and then GRIPS you. This isn't just music, folks. Something bigger's going on here. But you knew that already...
B00005RFAI|5.0|I don't make statements that I'll have to retract when the next pop music phenomenon comes along in five minutes, so pay particular attention to what I'm about to say.<br />Pink, that white-girl rapper whose first album was good but not remarkable, has created an album of pop music so personal, so fun, so catchy, so varied, so delightful and just so damn great that it silences all detractors. It's one of the most rewarding purchases I made last year, and, as pop music, it's fantastic.<br />As a single, &quot;Get This Party Started&quot; was incredibly well-done, I thought the first time I heard it. The rhythm got to me, and I danced in my car the next time I heard it. I saw it on an ad, and the vocals, occasionally cheesy, were easy to remember. The fourth through the 20th times I heard this on the radio, it was my favorite song playing. Even now, after hearing it again and again for a year-and-a-half, the song still hypes me up, even though the novelty wore off a long time ago.<br />&quot;Don't Let Me Get Me,&quot; despite being necessarily self-indulgent, manages to tackle the topics of self-esteem and confidence in a new way. When it was played on the radio, I remember finding it just as interesting as the first song. &quot;Just Like a Pill&quot; struck me less so, but it was still a quality song.<br />So I relented and bought the album, which surprised me beyond my expectations. On it, Pink manages to create several more radio-friendly songs, like the title track, and several personal songs like &quot;Family Portrait.&quot; The album also includes a rap song and a ballad, the aching &quot;Misery&quot; duet with Steven Tyler.<br />At the same time, Pink comes off as personal, realistic and, most importantly, humble.<br />This isn't my usual kind of music, but &quot;Misundastood&quot; works. It's a great album.
B00006SFLV|5.0|I din't realize there was a DVD collection of this series until yesterday when I happened in the Virgin mega store in Boston looking for a completely unreleated TV series DVD. I have all the MSCL episodes on tape in some form or another and they've gotten quite a lot of wear. I think all of my female friends on college borrowed them in college at one point. I wasn't going to write a review since there are already plenty of great ones here but as I was viewing this listing (to make sure the price online was better than in the store) someone in the house was watching Boston Public. Now while the 2 shows have different focuses the subject matter is the same, High School, Kids, Society. I'm sitting here now listening to the soap opera that is Boston Public in the background and thinking of how realistic MSCL was and not because of it's portrayal of public High School in the 90's but because of it's characters. I've met all the people in that series in my real life at one point, I think I even dated a few of them. MSCL was never overdramatic, it was real without being reality, and it was interesting without being flashy. If you never saw MSCL then this is your chance and if your in your 20's like me you'll probably see a few people you know in these episodes; you might even see yourself.
0425170349|4.0|Rainbow Six is an extremely well crafted story of international terrorism and the elite warriors who exist to stop it.  Tom Clancy's understanding of international politics, military, and governmental agencies is amazing.  Rainbow Six left me wondering how any fiction author could possess such a profound level of knowledge.  Clancy accurately portrays his subject matter down to the most minute detail.  RS does not read like the script to a brainless action movie.  Clancy intelligently presents all aspects of spec ops, including the bureacratic/political side, intelligence gathering, logistical considerations, tactics, and strategy.  Anyone with serious interest in military matters will greatly appreciate the authenticity and attention to detail.  <BR>I've seen a few recurring complaints regarding this book in the other reviews.  I would have to agree that Clancy is not the most talented character writer.  Certain important characters, such as John Clark and Dmitry Popov are well developed and interesting.  The minor characters in the Rainbow squad are also well written for their supporting role in the story.  Clancy truly captured the mentality and work ethic of Spec Ops troopers well.  At the same time, a lot of the minor characters just seem to blend into each other.  Different people seem to possess the same mannerisms.  This is forgiveable to a point, but Clancy probably takes it too far.  But the truth of the matter is that Clancy's power as a writer is fueled more by his scenarios than his characters.  When two Rainbow members are killed in an ambush, it seems distant and uncompelling.  Clnacy does not take the time to portray the team's mourning the loss and honoring their fallen comrades.  In fact I don't believe he even specifies which two troopers were killed.  Despite this flawed moment, the Rainbow story is still an extremely well crafted Spec Ops story.  I disagree with those who say the idea of fanatic environmentalists posing such a serious terroristthreat is implausible or ridiculous.  Reality is sometimes stranger than fiction.  Clancy's environmentalists don't seem any less likely to me than Hitler's Third Reich, Islamic fundamentalism, or Heaven's Gate.  When you unite a group of people in some form of fanatic ideology, the results can be frightening.  The fanatics in Rainbow Six had a radical goal (as do all fanatics) and with a major American corporation backing them up, they had the means to attempt to carry it out.  This doesn't seem implausible to me.
0316096199|4.0|This is a very powerful book. The opening chapter describes the brutal rape of the author at the end of her freshman year at University. The subsequent chapters deal with feelings of guilt and anger and her struggle to relate to those closest to her, her mother father and sister and good friends. She also has difficulties with the police who are depicted as something less than sympathetic. On her return to University her spots the rapist on the street and turns him into the police where he is subsequently charged and convicted through the courageous tenacity of Alice.<BR> The power in the telling of this true story lies in the uncompromising steely eyed look and description of the emotions surrounding Alice's rape. How does the victim react to those who love her but are incapable or at least unable to express support in a meaningful way? How do the prejudices and biases harboured by police, friends, family and psychiatrists fail to give the needed support? And not only that, they blame the victim. <BR> Then when a close friend of Alice is raped and Alice is not able to comfort or support her does it become clear that there is little anyone can offer the victim except warm and caring love, and even that is not enough and as Alice says at the end of the fourth chapter \\"No one can pull anyone back from anywhere. You save yourself or you remain unsaved.\\"<br />In the final chapter \\"Aftermath\\" Alice describes her life during the next ten years and we see that the rape is not an incident in the past that one \\"gets over\\" but a defining moment that affects Alice and all rape victims in way that is permanent and like survivors of the Vietnam war is identified as Post Traumatic Stress Syndrome. <br />As a man I wondered how would I respond to a rape victim. Is loving care the best we can do? It becomes evident that the only positive way is to work to prevent rapes. This is a book worth reading as difficult as that is. Alice Seabold has done a great service in telling her story. 4.5/5
B00005JLSC|5.0|Having seen (and loved) two stage versions of Chicago, I was curious as to how it would transfer to the screen.  It was MORE exciting, spectacular, and entertaining than I imagined.  This is an EXCEPTIONAL film for anyone who enjoys musicals, Bob Fosse, dancing, and/or theater.  I was most impressed by how creatively they moved from \\"real\\" to \\"stage\\" to insert the musical numbers, and by how visually stimulating they made some of the scenes.  I was also surprised by how well Richard Gere held his own in the musical numbers and very impressed by the talent for singing and dancing of Catherine Zeta-Jones.<br />A completely entertaining and enjoyable movie.  I feel safe in recommending this to anyone.
B00005LC6Z|4.0|maybe spoilers:this may not be good as the sequel but it was interresting to learn that laurie stodes is michael's sister
B0000640VO|5.0|I've seen &quot;Amelie&quot; six times in the theater and countless times on DVD. Each time I've watched it, I've introduced it to a different friend, usually someone who doesn't watch foreign films. &quot;Amelie&quot; works its spell every time, simply because it's about deciding to do good things for other people, finding a soulmate yet having chance bring you together and finding delight in life's smaller moments.<br />Beautifully filmed on location in Montmarte, France, the director Jean Pierre Jeunet began planning it while working in America on &quot;Alien Resurrection,&quot; compiling a list of all the things he loved about his area, all the things he'd ever wanted to film, and he built the story around those images. (Thus, we get the bits about the glasses dancing, the nuns working on their backhand.)<br />He uses his gift for visual effects and his love of Paris to create this film, which is as charming as every review has said. Audrey Tautou is instantly lovable. She's, at times, childish yet scheming. The schemes she devises are hysterical, and the film's underlying themes of kindness and hope resonate.
0553282980|5.0|I like poems very much!In this book I have the whole pleasure!!The story is exciting,romantic and also funny.It shows a good way to live. They are a lot of good ideas!! It shows that we have to live with the heart, and not make a habitude from our live!!!!There are so many things which are so important and which we forget so easy in our all day live.<BR>The boys all have their own problems!!!And that are problems from the live!!!That can also be our problems!!!And so the book touchs everybody, I think!<BR>I can really recommend this extraordinary book!!
B000066NW0|4.0|Alright, come on.  Enough with the whiney \\"But, but, but...she's not punk!\\" stuff.  If it isn't what you like just SAY so, but there's no need to be such jerks about it.  There (gasp!) are different genres of music.  I like Avril because it IS catchy music and I really like her voice.  Her music isn't that complicated, and her lyrics arent genious.  But really, who cares, because it goes together well.  I mean, she does sing well.  Listen to her on \\"I'm With You.\\"  It's so beautiful, I got chills.  The music is nice too.  For example, listen to \\"Naked.\\"  Maybe she isn't punk, huh?  So?  I run around pretending to be a WoodNymph, it's fun.  I like that she doesn't dress like Britney.  As much as I LOVE seeing her nasty belly ring...Avril and I are the same age, so maybe that's why I like her music.  Maybe it's really pop.  So?  I listen to other things, including Vast, Rufus Wainwright, and the Donnas(who are really punkrockish)  I dont much like punk music anyways, unless we're talking about the Sex Pistols.  <BR>Here's my review of the songs:<BR>01. Losing Grip:  I like this song for it's music mainly, the lyrics arent as strong.  It has a dark sound, much like \\"Naked\\"  9/10.<br />02: Complicated:  Due to the fact that I know this situation well, and the music and lyrics are good, I'd give this a 9.5/10.<br />03: Sk8er Boi:  I really like this song, it's fast and fun.  9/10.<br />04: Im With You:  I'm in love with this.  It's so beautiful and well sung.  She shows good vocals here. 11/10<br />05: Mobile: Mmm...not a favourite.  Very acoustic but kinda..boring to me.  5/10<br />06: Unwanted: Fast and a bit darker.  But it's nice.  I like her voice on this.  8/10<br />07. Tomorrow:  I really like this song.  It's soft and kinda boring...but it strikes me for some reason.  9/10<br />08. Anything But Ordinary:  I like the chorus, but not too much else.  7/10<br />09. Things I'll Never Say:  I Love this.  It's just a great song.  10/10 <br />10. My World:  It's okay...mid-tempo, not a favourite either.  7/10<br />11. Nobody's Fool:  Ick...I hate the rappin [stuff].  This is my least favourite!  3/10<br />12. To Much To Ask:  This one's ok, but nothing striking.  7/10<br />13.  Ooooh...I love this song!  It's so great...the music, lyrics, everything.  Probably the Best of the Album!  11/10<br />So there's what I think...Im sure you could care less, but at least I can spell :)  I'm so tired of seeing hateful reviews from people who can't even spell.  No WONDER you can't enjoy music right :) Hahahaha.<BR>-angel.
B000062XFG|5.0|I became a huge fan of Star Trek:TNG by the time the second season began.  But the 1988 writers' strike nearly sidelined the entire future of the show. Fortunately, they were able to salvage the season and managed to come up with some great stories.  Definitely one of my favorite episodes of this season, and one of the best of the whole series, is &quot;The Measure Of A Man&quot;.  As one reviewer has already stated, this episode alone is worth the price of the box set.<BR>My other season two favorites include, &quot;Q Who?&quot;, &quot;The Outrageous Okona&quot;, &quot;Loud As A Whisper&quot;, &quot;The Dauphin&quot;, &quot;The Icarus Factor&quot;, &quot;The Royale&quot;, &quot;The Emissary&quot;, &quot;Up The Long Ladder&quot;, and &quot;Shades Of Gray&quot;.<BR>Anyway you look at it, Star Trek:TNG season two on DVD will become a valuble addition to your collection. LIKE THE FINEST WINES, IT JUST GETS BETTER WITH AGE!
0767809246|5.0|i really enjoy this movie i have seen it like more than 100 times and still i am not tired of it.
B00005JKED|1.0|This is perhaps one of the worst and most mindless movies i've ever seen. Their is no semblence of plot and the movie has a feel of aimlessness. It doesn't feel like its going anywhere. Its filled with tons of meaningless violence and macho garbage that are the staple of movies aimed at younger males but it lacks a compelling story to go along with it. The ending where the rookie cop leaves the crooked cop to die and somehow he is let free (though we don't see how) before being shot by russians that are mentioned twice in the movie but not brought into the plot is terrible. On the plus Denzel shows his acting talent, but even he cannot save a film that lacks both plot and meaning.
B0000004V2|5.0|This album would be just another ho-hum 80's brit album if not for the amazing guitar work of Jon Squire. Just when each track begins to fall into a lulling drone Squire rescues it. This album is a three without Squire. With him it's a five. BUY IT!!!
B00006JJ1O|5.0|I was turned on to T.A.T.U. because a friend of mine bought me their single.  I got the CD ASAP and LOVE it!!!  They express real feelings and do it in a fun way.  There's also a Morrisey cover on there that rocks.  There's also a few songs in Russian and a russian rap break in the middle of a song.  \\"All the things she said\\" is on there in Russian and English AND you can see the video and watch movies of Julia (Oh Baby) and Lena when you place the CD in your computer.  It's a very cool thing!  I hope evryone else gives these girls a chance and loves them as much as I do!!
B00006JJ1O|5.0|I loved this CD! Everything about it was great. The songs were catchy and they were really good. Both of these girls are very talented! I hope to see more of them in the future!

B00006J3WH|4.0|The Buffy musical \\"Once More with Feeling\\" has that wonderful amateur \\"let's put on a show\\" vitality that makes it one of the TV highlights of recent years. Even the cast members who couldn't hold up the musical end of things seem to have a great time, and when the music works it's a thing of wonderment.<BR> The CD goes a long way to capturing the magic of the episode, but there are a few nits to pick. First, this is a straight music soundtrack; no sound effects or dialogue is included. The opening number, \\"Going Through the Motions\\" is funnier with the sounds of Buffy's fight included, and Anya's \\"Bunnies\\" needs the cricket chirping beforehand to signal the gang's incredulity. Most important, the lack of dialogue severely hurts \\"I Know What You Feel\\", where Dawn's \\"My sister's the Slayer\\" gets no reaction and Sweet's final lines just hang there. Second, some of the lyrics are incorrect as written in the liner notes. These are minor errors except for Spike's line in \\"Walk Through the Fire\\" (\\"No, I'll save her, then I'll kill her), where the written version completely takes the joke out of it. Finally, while the added soundtrack selections at the end are well chosen, the test version of \\"Give me Something to Sing About\\" seems gratuitous and grating. <BR> All these things aside, the CD is well worth it for any fans of the show and represents an amazing achievement for the cast and crew, especially Joss Whedon himself. It's like watching old friends suddenly display talents you never knew they had.
0553801511|5.0|I got this book at 6:00 pm when I walked in the door to see my roomate had been home to recieve the mail and left the package from Amazon out that had this book in it.  I'd just finished a grueling 10 hour day at the back of a even more gruelying 16 hour day with only three hours of sleep in between.  I was elated to recieve the books because Robin Hobb has pretty much made my top five authors list, and I was looking forward to this book.  That said, I was so exahusted that after feeding myself my only serious plan was to go to bed.  I laid down, and then after a few seconds I promised myself that I'd read the first chapter before I passed out.  It's three thirty now the next day.  I havn't been to sleep yet.  I literally couldn't put the book down, except to call in sick to work today.  I don't have the words for what I've just read, but I can say this; if you get a chance pick this book up.  Then again since this is the fifth book in this particular series, and the eighth book about this world, you already know that.  Don't you?
0553213105|1.0|Pride and prejudice, is a novel on the love and hate of a man and a woman who are perfect for each other from the beginning but do not realize it until the end.  It is about how a great love overcomes the prejudices that two of the main characters have for each other.  This novel, in my opinion was everlasting and boring.  One would be able to predict the outcome of the novel from the beginning, but must spend endless hours of reading to finally see the plot unwind.  Elizabeth Bennet and Mr. Darcy have a great hate for each other in the beginning, but slowly, thorough out the novel, begin to bid farewell to their prejudices of each other and find a love for each other they never knew they could have.  I did not enjoy reading this novel due to the fact that romance is not my favorite topic, especially when it is \\"old school\\" love.  I did not appreciate this book in anyway and wish that I never chose to read it.  I would not recommend this book to anyone who hates reading as much as I do and is disturbed at the fact that one would enjoy reading about love when they can just look out the window and see it happening right in front of them.  Pride and Prejudice is a novel that did not interest me, but may interest those old grannies that jump and express their happiness when everlasting romance novels end in happiness.
B00005RIKD|5.0|A briliant piece of art<br />The album starts fairly dark - just like his last solo album Brand New Day - but here with the usual closer Fragile. The song is really beautifully reinvented - it's little bit slowed down, with a brand new middle 8 in it and a wonderful chodo - really great. Anyway this version, which is on this album was recorded in the studio later that year. If you want to hear the original version, which was played that day, try the DVD ... All This Time .<br />The next song is a medley of \\"A thousand years\\" and \\"Perfect love ... Gone Wrong\\" - in \\"A Thousand Years\\" there is a little less Kipper and more Jason Rebello than in the original - and the whole song is a little bit jazzyer, which ends to \\"Perfect Love...\\" and then in the end of the song it goes back to \\"A Thousand...\\" - really wonderful idea how to connect two songs - it reminds me of circle theme, which Sting uses so much these years.<br />The fourth track is \\"All This Time\\" - a completely new version - something far from the usual live BND concert version (which is anyway great), but it \\"works\\" here.<br />Then comes the only Mercury Falling song - \\"The hounds of winter\\". The song is little bit faster than the original and \\"richer\\". Probably one of the best tracks on this album, although (not yet) my favorite.<br />\\"Mad about you\\" - though not played originally on concert (I think it is the verion from the day before), this version is really suberb - \\"upbeating\\" rhytm, haunting lyrics as always and more \\"arabesque\\" feeling in it. Perhaps the best verion of this track you can find.<br />Then there comes the first Police track - \\"Don't stand so close to me\\" - Sting here shows why he was and still remains a great musician and songwriter - the chorus is so haunting that you may catch yourself hours later that you just simply \\"can't get it of your head\\". Interesting version - \\"something else and new\\".<br />This song then \\"melts\\" into \\"When we dance\\" - my favorite on the album. Wonderful chello(Jaques Morelenbaum) and so brrrrriliant interpretation of the song by Sting that it brings me into tears every time I hear it.<br />\\"Dienda\\" is a new track (although you maybe heard it on some ocassions in 99 played with Branford Marsalis).It's a \\"re-interpratation\\" of the originally Kenny Kirkland's \\"Dienda\\" with Sting's lyrics - by the way so great that you can clearly imagine the picture of young Kenny playing on piano on Brooklyn Street. Haunting.<br />\\"She did anyway\\" - there comes the song which just can't be missing from the playlist in some \\"tango\\" version - yessss, Roxanne. Sometimes I think that it's such an old (don't get me wrong) song and it was interpreted in so many ways that the person of Roxanne had just jumped out of the song and she had started living her own life. In the middle of the song there is a change of mood and the song ends with a trombone solo !!! (Clark Gayton). When I first heard it I've nearly fall down from the chair ! :)<br />\\"They can't kill our joy\\" . There comes \\"If you love somebody\\" with great \\"sonic\\" ending with so much energy in it that you can nearly see as it converts into light and \\"shines into space\\". You'll fall in love with this version if you like the original.<br />\\"Brand new day\\" continues in the same mood with a bit of blues feeling. ...:)<br />\\"Fields of gold\\" is a little bit slower than the original with both chello and guitar (as always Dominic Miller) solos between the verses. Really nice version but... they can do it better - anyway still great.<br />There comes a time for some jazz - \\"Moon over Bourbon street\\" with some catchy piano (Jason Rebello). You can almost feel that you are in a little jazz bar with cigarete smoke everywhere around and of course with a band of great young talented and unknown :) musicians. The song suddenly stops in the middle (why?) and there's a time for two classics :<br />\\"If I ever loose my faith in you\\" - in this song you can clearly hear how had Sting's voice improved over theyears. Like a fine glass of wine.Another favorite track of mine (like the whole album) <br />\\"Every breath you take\\" - what new could I say - an all-time classic and perhaps the best pop song of the 80's (and 90's ...) closes the session in great style - uplifting and full of joy.(though still ambiguous a bit) <br />What is really intereSTING and wonderful about this album is the clarity of the sound. It's really as others here say one of the best live \\"gigs\\" ever recorded (IMHO). Playing it is like sitting with all these great musicians in one room- you laugh with them the same way as you are angry, sad or cry.<br />As you know, this album was recorded on 9/11 and that's the reason there are more dark songs. I think it was a right step to do that and if I look back these days (which are still not so far) I think it was also a good decision to play the concert and let the healing power of music work. Maybe there comes a day when other wonderful pieces (Ghost story, Every little thing...) will be played as they should be.
0316666343|5.0|I thought that this book was wonderful, she lived out her life through the people she lost, and how she comes to terms with her grief through theirs. Her parents seemed to have a picture perfect life, but beneath the surface the waters are troubled. Her sister hardens to dreal with the loss, and her little brother is kept in the dark. She learns through them, and watches her family spiral into a black time. <BR>Everyone is affected by her loss, and her father even discovers her killer, and because he has no proof, they think it to be the ravings of a grieving man.<br />I thought the book showed a freshness and a new point of view than any other I'd read, It was truely a good read.
B00000J7JO|5.0|This is the Pepper at their very darn best.  The slap bass from Flea, flowin from Anthony, best Frusciante effort ever, and of course Chad on the drums.  Theres maybe 1 song thats not great, but still very listenable.  One of the best songs not released is &quot;Easily.&quot;  Just a fast paced, energitic song, awesome two guitar outro and lyrics like this : &quot;I CANT TELL YOU WHO TO IDOLIZE/YOU THINK ITS ALMOST OVER BUT ITS ONLY ON THE RISE/.....THE STORY OF A WOMAN IN THE MORNING OF A WAR/REMIND ME IF YOU WILL EACTLY WHAT WERE FIGHTHING FOR/....&quot;  as Rolling Stone points out in their review as well.  Of course everyones fav's &quot;Scar Tissue&quot;, &quot;Otherside&quot;, &quot;Californication&quot; and &quot;Around the World&quot; are just incredible.  Other songs that make the album so damn good are &quot;Savior&quot;, &quot;This Velvet Glove&quot;, &quot;Right on Time&quot; and of course the beautiful sounding acoustic &quot;Road Trippin.&quot;  You will not be dissapointed trust me, after hearing &quot;By the Way&quot; album, although a close call, its their best album and the only other album that can be compared to as good as it is their BloodSugarSexMagik.  If you havnt bought this album, buy it and u will not be able to go without it.  Its just that good, and also try to find &quot;Gong-Li&quot; it was released only on the &quot;Scar Tissue&quot; single in the US.  Thats an awesome song that didnt make the album for some reason, kinda like &quot;Soul to Squeeze&quot; didnt make the BloodSugarSexMagik but.  Laters all-
0060930187|5.0|This is a brilliant first person account of the experience of having a mental disorder (including very exact descriptions of schizophrenia, back before it was widely known of in the 'sane' world, and before it was transformed into entertainment fare by the makers of the filmed 'A Beautiful Mind') and what contributed to its occurrence. Made all the more horrible and disturbing by the the fact that this is practically an autobiography (with fake names) and that Plath did not end up making it out of the illness alive. She killed herself not long after this novel was finally published.
B0000067X1|5.0|Man,I forgot what a classic obsure classic this is.A few years back I was kid(OK a person in his early 20's) who was raised on punk who needed something with more depth and so I was introduced to CAN.At first I bought 'Ege Bamyasi' and thought it had it's moments but for the most part it was just &quot;Jazz Rock&quot; and then I bought 'Tago Mago' and boy was I wrong.CAN is like a stellar funk band sent from Mars who was light years ahead of their time,music like this was not meant for human consumption.Gosh I started listing to this again and just realised again what a killer album this is,there has been many good albums in the past 30 years by other artist but none can hold a match to this.
0316096199|5.0|While 'The Lovely Bones' deserves a wide audience, this is the one to read.  A true crime autobiography, this account of Alice Sebold's rape, identification of her assailant, and depiction of his trial and conviction is a moving and exceptional read.  It is a heroic tale, presenting both the heroism of her testimony and the heroism of her tenacity in committing herself to ultimate victory.  Painfully honest in its details (principally with regard to the members of her family and their reactions) there is a final sense of collective redemption that parallels that of 'The Lovely Bones.'  A powerful debut.  Violence enters a sweet and fragile world and ends up wishing it hadn't.  Read this book.  Bonus: no political correctness here.
B000002LQR|4.0|You may not know how good this album truly is until u feel like whatever about the first 5 songs, but once you hear \\"I Could Have Lied\\" transition from the harder \\"Suck my Kiss\\", you really get a feel of the whole album.  The album has fast paced, head bangin, feel good tracks and a real soulful, peaceful and beautifully written feel upon hearing \\"I Could Have Lied\\" and of course \\"Under the Bridge\\", the song even non Chili Pepper fans like.  My personal fav's are: \\"Breaking the Girl\\", \\"Funky Monks\\", \\"Suck my Kiss\\", \\"I Could Have Lied\\", \\"Righteous and the Wicked\\", \\"Give it Away\\", \\"Apache Rose Peacock\\" , \\"Under the Bridge\\" in no particular order.  Thats 8 excellent songs, most Albums have like two if youre lucky these days.  If you've only heard their newwer stuff off of like \\"Claifornication\\" or \\"By the Way\\" u may be in for a surprise, but should make a quick transition to BloodSugar..... Its an absolutely awesome album, dont miss out and dont download, its worth all the cash u have to shell out, besides its real old and most stores have it priced pretty low or buy it used if u have to but GET IT!!!
0140042520|5.0|Another wonderful, practically edge-of-conscious novel with no definite plot by everyone's favorite perfectly insane Beat writer. In many ways I enjoy this book even better than 'On the Road.' It contains the same exciting beauty, applied to different subjects,and the same eccentric freedom fighters as lead characters. Every once in a while it attains the perfect harmony it seeks, turning long stretches with no apparent action into meditations on the beauty of nothingness, of loneliness, etc. We see the budding alcoholism of our narrator, which wil turn into a book ('Big Sur') of its own. We see what Kerouac saw in Buddhism, and we'll see converts in the book's readers. Kerouac has perhaps more real-life affect on his readers than any other American novelist, one of the few writers anywhere who really can change lives. Blah.
B00006LFGD|4.0|What the heck do Barbra Streisand's politics have to do with her performance on these songs? If you want to bash Barbra's politics... why don't you find a political web-site to do it on? This is for reviews of her MUSIC! Is that too hard to comprehend?
0375414053|5.0|It's not surprising that readers have such disparate opinions on this book -- it deals with a difficult topic and may be stirring up some of what we used to call the \\"mommy wars\\" --but some of the readers need to lighten up.  I agree with the reviewer who urges readers to accept the book as fiction and enjoy the wonderful, dead-on wit of the book.  I did not find the heroine (\\"K8\\"/Kate) silly, a bad mother/wife, a poor role model or a spoiled brat.  She comes from a lower-middle class background, had an unreliable father (which explains much of her drive and her great fear of relying on anyone other than herself), and worked her way into an extremely successful career through hard work and intelligence.  She loves her children passionately and that is the source of her conflict.  Some of the qualities that make her a successful career woman -- drive and perfectionism -- make her and those around her a little crazy.  Her husband, a very relaxed individual, exacerbates K8's compulsive tendencies with his what-me-worry attitude. That is often a conflict where opposites attract.  I think most mothers, whether or not they work outside the home, find their children have to outrank husband (and friends, other family members and leisure)in demands for attention.  That is on top of the work/family dilemma. These are some of the real conflicts that the book illustrates.  K8's far from perfect, but I found her more believable for that reason.  There is much in the book that is dead-on and hysterically funny.  It is not at all anti-stay-at-home mom -- K8's friend Jill, a stay-at-home mother, is practically elevated to sainthood in the book.  The author has deliberately chosen an extreme career for K8 -- with international travel,extremely demanding clients, an enduring misogynist culture and intense competition.  It is in some ways a caricature of the work/family conflicts the average person faces, but that provides a lot of the humor. Of course many of us may find other ways to resolve these conflicts, and God bless us all.  But let's not pillory K8 for the situation she finds herself in or way she chooses to resolve it.
0060930187|5.0|\\"The Bell Jar\\" has always been a favorite for me.  I believe it has such an association with the issues that may forever face women.  Not to be sexist but I don't believe a male would relate as much with the main character.  Her femaninity is quite an important part to the understanding of her.  She attempts to find her place in society while balancing the expectations around her.  This conflict leaves a duel mentality, where one minute she feels inferior to all around her, but the next, she feels she can overcome any obstacle.  An inability to cope with such emotions leave her frozen in fear.  I believe it to be a tragedy but there is no moment to define it as such, therefor, I think one would really have to relate to the character to understand.
B00004YRQA|4.0|This is definately the best memory card available for the Playstation 2.  It never gives any problems loading games or affecting your saved game or anything like that.  The reason it didn't get 5 stars from me though is the reason that 3rd Party memory cards can save more games.  But aslong as you don't need that much room or unless your a risk taker you can go ahead and get this memory card.  Well, that's all, I'm out.  HOLLA!
B000021YQV|4.0|I fell in love with soad's  first album, in  fact i got kinda obsses over it. The first album had awsome songs  like  like \\"war\\",\\"soil\\",suit-pee\\",\\"suger\\"   that made their first debut an original and amazing album... in  the other hand this second realese sounds very difirent  from the first.  I didnt realy enjoyed  it as much but then i told my self this is an awsome  and actullie original nu-metal act  not some cop off ... stuff like limp bizkit, linkin park, slipknot etc... System of a down is actullie a original band  that can realy play.  I gave it four starts  cuz it wasnt as near as good as the first one but this  still passes. Buy it !
B00006IR5S|5.0|He truly is the Mozart of his time.  His music is great for all ages especially his \\"God Bless America\\" which brings me to tears everytime I listen.  He is the world renound composer of Imperial March, and the Indiana Jones theme song.<br />...
0688145078|4.0|We bought the book for our two-year old son in anticipation of his new baby brother.  The story is simple enough and the pictures are colorful.  There is nothing wrong with buying this book.  However, since it is has paper pages (not board), we really can't give it to him for his own parousal like we can his other books.<br />The book mentioned the positives associated with the new baby.  A page on how the older sibling's life might adjust in a manner perceived not in their best interest (for example - being quieter at times) was not the focus of this book.
6305066345|4.0|This is an awesome movie starring my favorite actor Denzel Washington and my favorite basketball player, Ray Allen.  Well actually this movei is the reason he became my favorite basketball player.  Basically Denzel Washington is in jail for accidently killing his wife.  He is supposed to be in there for like 15 years.  His son however, Ray Allen who doesn't like his dad or forgive him for killing his mother is the greatest high school basketball player in the country.  Now Ray has to decide if he wants to turn pro or if he wants to go to college, and if college what college he wants to go to if that.  But you see, the jail man judge or sumthin let's Denzel out of jail for one week to try to convice his son to go to a certain college, if he is successful he will get his servance cut in half!  See, this is going to be a lot harder because Ray doesn't like his Dad so he doesn't want to listen to him.  See, Allen is also a little bitter because Denzel left his son alone to take care of his little sister.  Now, if he goes to the pros it won't be as difficult to take care of her.  In some parts of the movie it does get quite boring when they just show Denzel getting out of jail and not having really anything to do with his son.  Allen depends on his family for adivce and gets it.  So what does Ray decide to do?  Well your going to have to pick up this movie to find out.  And trust me it will be worth it because it is exxtrordinary!  Pick it up today.  HOLLA!
0684833395|1.0|In my words Catch-22 is overrated.  This book could have been summed up in one chapter, and in all its wordiness the only point is that war is extremely boring.  Although each chapter had something exciting, Joseph Heller droned on relentlessly about a single character.  The climax of the book is when Yossarian is up in the bomber on a mission to Bologna and the gunners guts fall out, because a piece of flak went into his stomach.  The whole time the gunner is crying out \\"I'm cold, I'm cold!\\"  One side of the book that I liked was how Joseph Heller made each chapter about one person, which makes it slightly better, because the cast is always growing.  Each character is unique, and I value that, but his subject matter poor.  All in all I had to force myself to read this book.
B000066NW0|5.0|In my own opinion I belive that her music is like no other I've ever heard before. Some people would call her punk, but I think whatever she is would be ok. When I hear her music I feel that it's me on the radio, although she sounds a lot better than me. I am proud to call myself a fan. We should be so lucky to have such a talented music artist.
B000066C6Z|5.0|Most of it's been said -- this movie is hilarious in that zany Airplane/Naked Gun/Hot Shots kind of way, with the straight-faced gags and all -- but one thing has not been emphasized enough. Val Kilmer is UNBELIEVABLY HOT!!! Not only is he fantastically attractive, but the singing and especially dancing are to die for. Just another reason to watch a movie which would have been fantastic anyway.
B00005R87Q|4.0|Just like the name says, it is a fast paced movie with some furious driving and acting.  The main reason that I like the movie is it aint like most action movies like XXX, it actually has a solid storyline and acting behind it.  Vin Diesel (playing as Dominic Toretto) makes his action-packed debut in this awesome movie.  He is the best racer out there, well he has this rival named Johnny Tran.  Both of them are very good, but nobody really knows which one is better.  Well they were out to find out who is the best as both of them are think they are the greatest at what they do.  Also, Paul Walker plays the part of the new guy in town who thinks he is just as good as Vin Diesel and Johnny Tran.  And he is sure that he is going to prove it in just a matter of time.  But what's this guy's secret?  Your going to have to watch the movie to find out!  He was great accompiant for the flick.  These guys live for speed, racing in these amazing cars.  Also, the races take place in the greatest city in the world- Los Angelas.  Basically if you are a fan of racing-action-high speed movies this one may wind up being your favorite.  It is definately my favorite of this genre.  There are many high paced, dangerous stunts performed in this movie.  Can you handle something going at this speed?  Go out, pick up this movie, and find out today!  Additionally, one more thing, JA RULE is in this movie for ya'll who don't know!  That is another plus for a reason to pick this up.  I'm outta hear, aiight? Take care.  HOLLA!
0553801511|5.0|Robin Hobb is the best writer, nobody makes you fall for the characters like her. I love a alot of authors but she is my all time favorite! I almost understand why the women from the movie &quot;Misery&quot; kidnapped the author. Just kidding, but I do  wish I could read each chapter as it is created!  Robin I can't wait for the next book, please hurry!! A year feels like an eternity.

6300213668|5.0|This movie is awesome.  Completely enjoyable by all members of the family.  (It's my 8-year-old's favorite movie.)  We love to sing along to the songs.  Highly recommended!
0446677450|5.0|This was one of the best book of the year!  I read the book in two days! I have a degree in finance but this book gave me the education that I should have received!!! Rich Dad Poor Dad will teach you how to increase your passive income to exceed your expenses and ultimately release you from the rat race. It trains you to THINK!  It teaches you to look at the financial aspect of everything.  You'll be amazed at how much you can grow from this simple little book.  I also recommend The Cash Flow Quadrant and The Millionaire Next Door.
B000063UR2|4.0|i'm kind of a biased reviewer, since this movie's got a little of \\"sentimental\\" attachement to it.  i'm 23, and when this one came out back in the day i was all into the sci-fi stuff with big monsters!  so, after joining the army and WORKING with monsters, i like to relive that childhood stuff.  the BEST thing about this ultimate set is that it's got the renewed version, which is pretty slick, and the original theatrical version.  watch that one completely also, since it'll really make you smile!

B00000K31Q|5.0|I have always been a fan of Shakespeare's Taming of the Shrew, and this new rendition puts a fabulous modern spin on the story.  The humor is witty and intelligent; the characters are strongly developed into unique individuals.  Well worth it!
0446677450|3.0|This book brought together my thoughts about money that I have been thinking about over the past few years. I highly recommend this book to anyone who thinks there is &quot;another way&quot; to supporting yourself in life. Like several of the other commenters, consider this book a good starting point. I am now motivated to read about setting up corporations and looking into real estate and stocks, one step at a time.
B00007M5CO|4.0|BajoFondo is a compilation of the eclectic electronic scene of Argentina. In the path of Gotan Project but with a strong electronic sound, the soul  of tango works as a guest.<BR>Featuring Adriana Varela, the most popular singer in Buenos Aires traditional tangoscene, Perfume is the best of this work, capturing both sadness of tango and the pulse of fine house.<BR>The marriage between tango and drum n' bass and house is not so good as I like, but the downtempo tracks of Campo, Didi Gutman and Juan Blas sounds like if you're walking Buenos Aires by night.
B000066C87|3.0|I was wild to see this film after seeing the trailer for it. The cast, the British murder mystery, rainy country weekend, bumbling inspector, etc. Just my cup of tea. Yet, while this is very moody and atmospheric, with top-drawer casting, as a mystery it doesn't make it. The pace is very slow, almost excruciatingly so. The murder, which is led up to cleverly, takes far too long to happen. There are many suspects with overlapping plotlines, but when you unravel them all, they lead nowhere. The ending was a complete bust. It's your typical abovestairs/belowstairs British class system drama. It's more about that than the murder; a dismal let-down when one was expecting a more updated Agatha Christie-type mystery, which is just what the trailer portrayed. There were too many unresolved storylines, some of which were interesting, but destined to remain unexplored. My overall impression is that this is just a slice of a better, more rounded film.  Others have complained that Altman focuses more on style than substance, and I would have to agree in the case of Gosford Park.
B000002KAT|5.0|I've been listening to this album for over 25 years. Wow times sure have changed, remember 4K for a nice new car with a V8. This album is my &quot;happy place&quot; to quote a silly Adam Sandler movie. Theres a densly wooded area with several big rocks to sit on, a twenty foot high waterfall feeds a small stream. The sounds of nature fill the air. Maybe thats what Van found here, the sounds of nature ( no, not some humpback whales singing to Kenny G ) but a natural flowing easy sound. Easy and yet filled with all the complications of life itself. The pains the joys the rollercoaster of a lifetime of love found and shared, those lost or passed by and missed by an inch. Hard to classify this music but it is truly beautiful to me, no music comes to mind for comparison. Its not for everyone but i wish it was, somehow the world would be a better place.
0375414053|1.0|As someone who knows a bit about what Kate Reddy pretends to do for a living in this book, I choked with laughter all the way through the first chapter. If only the author had done some preliminary research as to what a hedge fund manager actually does this book might have been more palatable and I might have taken it home from the bookstore. <br />As a hedge fund manager, walking in the door at 9:05am would be something extremely unusual - equivalent to an abdication of all responsibility. In London, the markets open at 8am, and woe betide anyone who is not at their desks at 7:30 when the morning meetings at large asset managers start. Kate woke up at 6? Try 5 or 4:30. <br />And later in the book, Kate calmly accepts a complete lack of bonus. In this industry a good 50%+ of your compensation comes at bonus time. No bonus is tantamount to an invitation to resign ASAP. <br />I imagine that this book probably has something important to say about the difficulties of raising children and simultaneously rising to meet the challenges of an intense career. It's a pity the author decided to prove her point by choosing a sexy career for her heroine without bothering to do the research which would have backed it up. If Allison Pearson thinks Kate Reddy has it tough, she should see how the rest of us have it.
0553213105|5.0|Pride and Prejudice takes place in a small village called Hertfordshire, around the late 18th century. The story is based on the Bennet family, which consists of a mother, a father, and five daughters. Mr. Bennet is a country squire who is not very wealthy. Mrs. Bennet is a house wife and her goal throughout the book is to marry her daughters off to wealthy gentlemen. The main plot of the story is molded around Jane Bennet and Elizabeth Bennet finding their husbands, through both 'trials and tribulations.' Jane marries the wealthy Mr. Bingley, and Elizabeth marries the handsome and wealthy Mr. Darcy.<br /> Jane Austin did a wonderful job of writing Pride and Prejudice. She wrote so that you could feel the love that Jane was feeling, and you could feel the hate that Elizabeth felt. She also wrote descriptively so you could imagine the storm that Jane went through, and you could see the gorgeous house that Mr. Bingley lived in. Whenever I read this book I wished I had admirers like Mr. Bingley. I must admit that while the book had a happy ending, it made me sad because I wanted to be in Jane and Elizabeth's shoes.<br /> When I think of classic books, I think of stuffy old libraries where stuffy old people go to read books that were written back when the dinosaurs roamed the earth. Reading this book made me realize that these old stuffy books are called classics for a reason.This book was not a boring read! I am the sort of person who loves to watch and read teen stories. You know, the stories where the guy and the girl meet each other and fall in love. Jane Austin did a great job of keeping my attention. Reading the book mixed up the same emotions as Freddie Prinze Jr. and Rachel Leigh Cook did in \\"She's All That.\\"<br /> Pride and Prejudice is a classic love story that everyone that believes in love should read. I believe that people of all ages could find it as emotional as many of the best love stories. Jane Austin wrote a real winner that every school, bookstore, and library should have a copy of.
B00005JL96|3.0|I rented this movie based on the positive reviews listed here, and I have to say I was a little disappointed. I went into the film with high hopes for fun, and there were some funny moments, but a lot of it felt flat and way too far-fetched. Now, granted, it's Disney, and they're all the magic of fairy tales, but &quot;Lilo and Stitch&quot; was missing something. Perhaps it was lacking the magic.
055321277X|3.0|Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde is an easy read.  Robert Louis Stevenson has his characters remain flat throughout the story.  The events are told at face value and details are limited throughout this book.  Stevenson starts the book out as a mystery, leading one to wonder who this hideous and purely evil Hyde truly is and what he wants.  Throughout the story it looks like he is holding something over Dr. Jekyll by means of blackmail.  The two main characters are introduced through a rather unimportant character, Enfield, telling of his first encounter with Hyde. <BR>The story line was phenomenal and unique at the time it was written.  Unfortunately, because it is a classic, most people start reading the book already knowing the outcome.  The mysterious atmosphere of the story is ruined as the majority of readers have a good idea of who this Hyde character really is.<BR>My feelings on this book are neutral.  I definitely would not consider it one of the best books I have ever read, but it isn't the worst either.  It tells the message for which it was created, but there is not much more than that.  It is the classic story of the duality of man, good and evil, which, again, was a unique story line at the time it was written, but too common of a theme today.
1573229725|5.0|I loved this book.  It twisted and turned, never going where I thought it would.  I couldn't put it down.  Great new writer, wonderful language.  I was immersed in the Victorian London setting for days.  I would highly recommend this one.
0688170528|5.0|In this riveting novel, The Pact, Picoult discusses and portrays the feelings of anger, guilt, and loss.  His writing techniques bring the characters to life and get you wrapped up in their story.   The Hartes and the Gold family are dynamic characters caught up in a tremendous tragedy.  These two families live right next door to each other in a small, quaint New Hampshire town.  Their lives are the same considering both of the husbands are doctors and the wives are pregnant. Having both of the wives pregnant, it sets up their soon to be son and daughters relationship right from the beginning.  When Emily and Chris are in their teenage years, they plan to accomplish a double suicide.  However, everything did not go as planned.  Emily Gold died while Chris Harte was still alive.  Inevitable, Chris is charged with first-degree murder, but wasn't actually involved.  Jodi Picoult does an excellent job at showing the relationship between past and present.  This helps show how Emily and Chris' friendship and love grew into each other. When the trial begins with Chris, he and many others questioned Emily's feelings towards suicide, if it was even possible for her to commit such a dreadful crime.  Although Emily's feelings of self infliction never seemed visible on the inside no one knew that she was pregnant.  I believe this is the true reason she decided to take her own life and the life of her baby. Even though Chris was at the carousel when Emily committed suicide, he did the pull the trigger, but he did it because she wanted him to.  I think since he pulled the trigger that he is still innocent because she wanted to die so badly but she couldn't do it herself.  Chris loved Emily so much that he would do anything for her even help in committing suicide.  This book is heart felt, mind boggling, filled with sorrow, and wont ever let you put it down.

B00005JKZT|3.0|Boiling any quality novel down to the constraints of a motion picture means leaving some important elements out.  When I saw \\"The Fellowship of The Ring\\" I understood what Jackson was doing and why things had to be changed, other things added or left unsaid.  The sheer joy of having such a magnificent and beloved work brought to the screen in such a thoroughly artistic, sensitive, and powerful manner was very moving.<br />\\"The Two Towers\\", while visually and technically stunning, really failed to maintain the standards established by the first film.  The changes Jackson made are very well-documented by other reviewers, so I won't go into them in detail.  But, unlike FoTR, where all changes made sense to me, Jacksons embellishments here seemed confusing.<br />It's almost as though he soomehow got lost in the Dead Marshes and was never able to find his way back out.<br />Just a couple points: The battle of Helm's Deep was terrific, and having Gandalf and Eomer ride down the hill to the rescue was a nice touch (though having the Ents do the job would not have been a stretch for Jackson).  But, all we see is the rescuers riding down the hill, then -BANG- we're with Frodo.  The next time we see Gandalf, everything's over.  It was just too abrupt.<br />Making Faromir into a greedy man like his brother was wrong-headed.  Tolkein obviously had Faromir the good guy as a counterweight to Boromir, to show us that there is still hope in men.  Jackson seems a bit confused as to whether men deserve any hope.<br />And, lastly, bringing Frodo to Gondor made NO sense whatsoever.  What was Jackson thinking?  Though, I must admit I *did* like Sam's speech - very moving; but it, also, seemed rather abrupt.<br />Much of the character development seemed an afterthought; many moments (with the exception of Gollum, Frodo, and Sam), seemed to appear out of thin air, then disappear just as quickly.<br />There are obviously some pretty big holes in the theatrical release; one leaves the theatre thinking that there must be at least 40 minutes for Jackson to restore in his special edition DVD, certainly due out in November, 2003.  Too bad we have to wait that long for the final verdict on this picture.<br />My advice to Jackson: think long and hard before you re-cut \\"The Two Towers\\".  Your characters are getting lost in your grandiosity: they are becoming paper-thin, and no amount of silly dream-sequence flashbacks can make them more compelling.<br />And, for God's sake, have Aragorn kiss Eowyn!
0316666343|2.0|Ugh. This was a recent selection in my book club, and apparently everyone else either liked or loved it. I thought it was mediocre at best. In spite of having such a fascinating premise, the execution is deeply disappointing. I felt like it had been written in a Writer's Workshop (or maybe just a fiction writing class at a community college). The symbolism was heavy handed (burning the ties that bind, broken glass/broken lives, etc.) and the writing was very uneven. Sometimes it was careful and well crafted, but more often it was overdone and occasionally it was flat and empty. <br />I'm sure that the scene where she danced with her grandfather in heaven signified some terribly important transition for her, but by then I had stopped caring -- about her or her family, who were a bunch of enigmas. So, her mother is so emotionally fraught that she leaves the family (including her two remaining children) and as far as I can tell pretty much ceases contact with them. Maybe I could accept that. But then, (Spoiler here...skip to next paragraph if you don't want to know) eight years later she finds out her husband is ill, and comes rushing back to them. Sure, the son is sort of mad, but the rest of them embrace her as if she'd been on a long vacation. Would a real family do that? The best-drawn, most believable character in the whole book was the serial killer himself, but his ultimate demise is really kind of silly. Even the people who liked the book found the ending pretty awful. <br />There are so many wonderful books out there. Skip this one and try something like Evening by Susan Minot instead. It's challenging, beautiful and haunting.
B00003CXTG|5.0|Pearl Harbor is one of the best films I have seen in a while. Micheal Bay does an excellent job of creating this wonderful masterpiece. A must see for anyone, perfect to watch with your significant other, a little bombing for the guys and a little romance for the girls. A perfect movie for teens especially since Heart throbs Josh Hartnett and Ben Affleck star in it. And for all you guys there is Kate Beckinsale, which is a beautiful ray of light in this movie. The story closly follows two young men who are best friends for life, Rafe McCawley (Affleck)and Danny Walker (Hartnett) grew up on a farm together and both became pilots in the U.S. Army. Rafe suddenly finds himself in love with Eveleyn Johnson (Beckinsale) but when Rafe leaves to fight in England he leaves Evelyn missing him. Danny and Evelyn find out that Rafes plane was shot down and he was declared dead. Danny and Evelyn look to each other for comfort but find themselves falling in love, Rafe reappears and the hole thing just takes off. A great movie, But I must warn you that if your a Josh Hartnett fan (like myself bigtime) then the end will be sad but I recommend it anyway!
B00006JJ1O|5.0|These girls are great, the album combines great dance music with truly inspired lyrics.  The enhanced content is great, especially the music video for \\"All the things she said\\", which is my favorite song on the album, particularly the russian version.  Buy it and enjoy!
B000002MM8|4.0|When I first got \\"ItL\\", I actually did not like it. There is a long intro which turned me off right away, and at first I didn't grasp it. It wasn't until several years later, when I gave it another chance, that I actually connected with this music. It is very unique, with some exotic instruments. Yes, it is slow paced (I was at the time a rabid Death-Metal fan), but, as I later found, there is nothing wrong with that. When you put this on, you better be ready, willing and able to quietly let the music take you away on a blissful journey. They have a male and female singer, but they sing on different songs, never together on the same one. I find that odd, but truth is, each song fits marvelously with the vocalist chosen, and I could not imagine it otherwise. For those with the desire for something different, something that will take time to sink in, something that doesn't pummel you with sound from the get-go and takes time to unravel, look no further. I enjoy unrelenting, fast, violent music, but I also love mellow, meditative music like this. Enchanting.
0064471837|4.0|Sabriel is the daughter of Abhorsen, a famous necromancer, but her father goes missing and the only place she can find him is in the Old Kingdom. The Old Kingdom is not a friendly place however, the dead roam free and magic is the only way to survive. But how is a girl who just finished school suppose to track down her father in such a place? Even with the help of Mogget, a cat who is more then he appears, and Touchstone, a freshly revived swordsman and mage, the rescue mission still won't be smooth sailing. Something dead and powerful is after Sabriel and she must become an even greater necromancer than her father if she hopes to survive.<br />I adored the setting and magic system. The necromancy aspect in this book is the most interesting I've ever read about. The engrossing, fast paced plot makes this book a real page turner. This could have easily been a five star book if the characters had been more interesting. There was very little character development and what little there was came across as cold. Still, I probably will read some other books in this series, if only for the rich world that Garth Nix has created.
0312305060|1.0|This book was a selection of my book club of university women about a year and a half ago.  The reaction was overwhelmingly negative.  A couple of women of 20 liked it.  The major complaint were the flashbacks from one generation to the next. I finally read all of the first, all of the second and all of third separately. The writing was good but my feeling for the characters was non-existent. I'm sorry I bought the book. I hope the movie redeems it. Gloria S. Hampton
0767830555|5.0|Director Martin Scorsese and screenwriter Paul Schrader have concocted a perfect movie with \\"Taxi Driver,\\" which follows Robert deNiro's defining role of loner cabbie Travis Bickle.  The claustrophobic sets and tight cinematography, Bernard Herrmann's curiously tasty mix of polyphony and jazz in his final score, and the ever-present foley effect of an alarm clock ticking (connoting Bickle's state of mind of mental deterioration, a human time-bomb waiting to explode) all make for a highly personal character study of this self-described \\"God's Lonely Man.\\"<br />What's more, Scorsese's triumph is getting the viewer to actually identify and sympathise with Travis, with his sense of isolation from society, with his obsession over Cybill Shepherd, his taking the young prositute, Iris (played with uncanny spunk by a young Jodie Foster) under his wing, and his unflagging mania for vengeance against \\"the scum, the dogs, the filth.\\"  As he pads anonymously up and down Broadway, as he drives his taxi on rainswept streets in the wee hours of the morning, and as he sits alone in his apartment, pouring peach brandy over his Wheaties, we the viewers are along on his lonely ride and journey into fear.<br />Is Travis the hero, the antihero or the villain of this flick?  It really doesn't matter. Travis is a man compelled, his hand forced by the rot, corruption and indifferent hatred bred on the city streets.  The cesspool of crime is its logical consequence, just as much as is Travis, the loner turned lone gunman.  It is fitting that in his \\"training\\" scenes he is wearing cowboy boots, for he has a score to settle.  Not so much with Sport (played with abrasive wit by Harvey Keitel) and the pimps, johns and druggies that people this new urban frontier of lawlessness.  No, they are merely the tangible targets of his psychotic hate; The vengeance Travis metes out with his .44 Magnum is against a world that sees him as a virtual invisible man. Just as society turned their backs on the Vietnam vet, so does the woman of his dreams, Betsy (Shepherd).  Initially, Travis sees her as the last glimmer of hope for the redemption of a society gone to ruin.  But, when she rebuffs and deserts him over the clumsy social faux-pas of taking her to a porno movie on a first date, society loses all meaning to him, and he exacts his vengeance on society in order to transcend her rejection of him.  You can tell his fate is sealed when he sees his life \\"pointed in one direction....there never has been any choice for me.\\" <br />The setting is modern, but what makes \\"Taxi Driver\\" into an eternal classic is its dark and tragic sense-of-life. Scorsese's movies would never be so darkly hopeless after this one; Even the gruesome \\"Goodfellas\\" had a much more lighthearted touch (if you can believe it).  This would also be Bernard Herrmann's last score.  In fact, he died just hours after recording the last bars of the score on a Hollywood sound stage.  It is a fitting swan-song for the movies' greatest composer, and a greater loss for Hollywood than they'll ever realise.<br />Darker than almost all films noir, think of \\"Death Wish\\" crossed with \\"Othello\\" when you think of \\"Taxi Driver.\\"
B00005JKZT|2.0|I was looking forward to the sequel of Peter Jackson's comedy classic. How long before Frodo would fall over followed by Sam's dutiful reminder of him of his Christian name? About twenty minutes into the film, as it happened. Are the guys slipping? But any fears of a repeat of the uncontrollable and embarrassing giggling I helplessly released during 'Fellowship' proved unfounded. This is because it's hard to smile while your teeth are juddering against each other. Yes, my sister's kid and I had ventured once more into Siberia, that is the cavernous bowels of cinema one at my local multiplex, home of the most demented air conditioning system yet invented by man or hobbit. In fact, I suspected the 'hand' of Sauren at work, in a malicious attempt to poison the audience against good filming. He needn't have bothered, as it turned out. The kid was wearing a T-shirt, thermal top, jumper and a jacket. Despite being under more clobber than Muhammad Ali throughout his entire career, he still requested another jacket be flung on top of him. I, in a gesture of soon to be futile machismo, was merely wearing a super thick wooly jumper. After 30 minutes of towering towers, my nose had gone numb and my hand flailed wildly under the seat for that St Bernard with the barrel of brandy. These arctic conditions clouded my impression of the entire picture. First, Gandalf's epic fight with the fire demon Bolrog at the film's opening. \\"G..g...give him a free t..ticket to cinema one!\\" I exhorted in vain to the big G as the ferocious battle raged. Trust me, Bolrog's flames would die quickly. Gandalf rather unhelpfully anounced himself as no longer monickered 'The Grey' but 'The White', which meant he kept disappearing for large stretches of the film due to the icicles hanging down from my eyebrows. Henceforth, as the reels turned, every utterance by the game cast only seemed to speak of our cruel predicament. \\"So...pale...so cold\\" said Grima Wormtongue while carressing Eowyn's cheek. \\"Likethe last chill before spring....\\" Boy, you said it, Chewie. I mean, Grimi. When the gang perchanced upon Theoden, he looked like he had already spent three hours in cinema one. Luckily, Gandalf thaws him out. Hey, how about sending us a bolt, Gandy? We're dying in here! We longed for the stretches of dull, incomprehensible dialogue between Theoden and other middle Earthers in his throne room to meander on and on, as there were torches flickering in the background. At one point the kid started flailing wildly with his arms. Was he incensed by Frodo walking to the left of a rock instead of the right as depicted in Tolkien's novel, or was this a last desperate attempt to ward off frostbite? This relentless cold reminded me of Tarkovsky's marvelous 'Andrei Rublev', a Russian fresco set largely in medieval winter. Tarkovsky would rarely cut, instead opting for a series of masterful and subtle long takes with an eye to background detail that united man with earth to such an extent that the screen appeared to be an open door in which one could almost step straight back in time. Jackson does the opposite, resulting in a muddled, uninvolving picture. Kudos though to Sean Astin, whose performance transcends even the misguided 'a word from our sponser' speech at the film's close. Although it was a freezing day, it was nice to step back out through the cinema doors into the warm. The conclusion I have come to is that you definately need two towers. One for the Elves and the other for several thousand pairs of thermal underpants.
0451191153|4.0|Wow.  Where to start with a book of this size, scope, and complexity?<br />Well, first, Ayn Rand is not a goddess.  The sheer number of quasi-disciples ranting on this website (and others) about how she changed their lives are not only frightening, they're missing the point.  Of course, their blind adherence to her philosophy will allow them to brand me a \\"second-hander\\" or something of the sort and write off my comments as frightened or jealous.  Go Googling for \\"Ayn Rand cult\\" sometime, and you'll see just how far the tentacles of this beast can stretch.<br />With that said, this is actually a very enjoyable book.  Not often can I find myself pulled ahead from page to page by the writing style of a Harlequin Romance series novelist, while simultaneously being forced to pause and ponder some of the complex motivations of her characters or the ideas they (sometimes unconvincingly) exchanged during lengthy monologues.  Rand has some very original ideas (or at least cobbles together an original synthesis of these ideas from other philosophies/ers).  Her ideas on individuality, while carried here to an extreme, could stand to be applied in moderation to a culture that seems to now be run by masses of simpering Keatings who refuse to accept responsibility.<br />The character of Gail Wynand is, to me, the most interesting in the whole book.  Though all of the characters, at various times, make decisions that seem strange based on complex motives dealing with unusual ideas of pleasure, pain, and need, Wynand does this almost constantly.  He grants the people power over him by convincing himself he owns them; he befriends Roark, tries to save him, and then abandons him after Roark saves himself; the list goes on and on.  Despite the woodenness and archetypicality of most of the other characters, in Wynand Rand managed to create someone genuine and believable.<br />And for those claiming that Roark rapes Dominique, to my recollection she does not fight back.  That would make it rape.  Sex can be violent, and often is, without the actual act of rape taking place.  Considering how messed-up Dominique's ideas of power and pleasure are, she might just be a textbook masochist, in which case causing her sexual pain would be the highest pleasure Howard could give her.<br />Now for the caveats:<br />First, this novel displays an astounding naivete about human nature and socioeconomic theory.  Especially in the wake of corporate accountability scandals, is there anyone left who actually believes that the Roarks of the world will triumph over those who are willing to sleaze around and take whatever they can whenever they can from whomever they can?  The current climate in America is a strange one:  Tooheys abound, but they are in Roarkian positions in society.  Rand's assumptions about the nature of power and of the masses have proven not to be quite as accurate as they first seem.<br />I would also recommend finding out a bit about Rand's life before either slamming or idolizing this book, or any of her others.  For instance, knowing that her family's store was taken over by the state in Russia, forcing her family into poverty when she was still a child, can help put into perspective her near-hysterical insistence that collectivism can never work, EVER, IN ANY FORM!!!(etc...).  And knowing a bit about her circle of devotees and their practices, such as a modified process of expulsion and banishment for members that Rand disagreed with, can show what the world would be like populated with megalomaniacs like Roark, or Rand herself.<br />Overall, this is a very thought-provoking, enjoyable read, to be read by anyone frustrated with the vapidity and self-conscious posturing of most modern novels.  Just don't get sucked one way or the other by the raging controversies and you'll come out of it enriched and (possibly) more understanding of the mindset of anyone you know who may seem to behave like Roark at times.<br />And to those who whine that Roark's ending speech is too long, pick up Atlas Shrugged.  If memory serves, John Galt's ending speech is at least four times as long.'s ending speech is too long, pick up Atlas Shrugged.

Deliverance totally blast my ears and I really mean ALL the songs are great in the album, even though my bf would agrue My Arms, Your Hearse is better and I have realized and agreed with him.  If you are expecting the melodic guitar and nice clean vocal after growing like crazy, then expect nothing more but those.  Well anywayz, let's make a long story short, GET THIS ALBUM!

B00005JL7Q|5.0|Every once in a while a movie comes along that makes you feel better about yourself. The kind of movie that when you are walking out of the theater you feel something special. You know you just saw a great movie. When I saw \\"About a Boy\\" last summer I had that feeling. I have never been a huge Hugh Grant fan, but after seeing this film, I can't help but respect him as an actor. Of course it is hard to say how much Grant was acting and how much he was just acting off of life experiences.<br />Grant plays a version of the man's man. He drives a fast car, lives in a trendy London apartment. He has a nice television and all the DVD's and CD's that any man could want. Oh yeah, he also has a seemingly endless supply of money. He also like to meet woman, something that he thinks, could be aided if he attends a help group for single parents. Grant does get lucky and meets an attractive woman, played by Rachel Weisz. His date with Weisz's character sets up the entire movie.<br />I have to meet a person that did not enjoy and appreciate this movie. It is a unique story told in the kind of way that more movies should be told.
0380730367|5.0|In the last 30 day I`ve read all five of Lehane' Kinzie/Gennaro books, finishing Prayers for Rain last night. Lehane has created a terrific franchise in the mystery/thriller arena with his realistic and (more importantly) entertaining pair of detectives. You like these people he's created and believe their motives for what they choose to do as they trek through the plot. Clearly I've found a lot of compelling entertainment in these stories. <br />The first book in the series, A Drink Before the War, really sucked me in, being in the same vein as the Elvis Cole series by Robert Crais which I also recommend. Both series are consistently well-written, a clear step (or two) above pop/trash/beach fiction, funny, intelligent stories where the plot make sense, and the characters seem frighteningly real. It turned out that the first Kinzie/Gennaro yarn was the lightest. Each one after has ratcheted up the twists and turns, but kept the personality of the characters growing and building. The stories definitely got blacker and bleaker in the depraved actions of the bad guys. By Prayers for Rain, the villain is a hardcore-fulltime psychopath, and Patrick and Angie are a-little-further-than-borderline vigilantes. <br />After racing through five of the books in so short a period, I am struck with a sense of vulnerability. If some bad dude makes it their career to mess with you, and if they have no normal limits to their behavior, you're just screwed. How can a normal, follow the rules type of citizen even comprehend the introduction of aggression and violence into their regular lives?  Unless you have friends to help you out like Kenzie and Gennaro you might as well move out of the country and hope you're never found. Read these, you'll like them.

1559408855|5.0|A suggestion to those who have been so appalled by this movie as to give it negative reviews: read the back of the video or DVD before watching the movie, and save yourself and the rest of us a lot of time.  If escapist entertainment is your cup of tea, then by all means indulge.  But, like it or not, films like should and indeed must exist.<br />That said, this film is not for the faint-hearted or those with weak stomachs.  An author once said that it is the function of the artist to hold a mirror up to society, but that it's not the fault of the artist if society doesn't like what it sees.  Such is that case with \\"Salo.\\"<br />Yes, if you watch this movie you will see a protrayal of human depravity, brutality and cruelty to a degree you probably hadn't imagined possible.  You might not have believed, or wanted to believe, that people are capable of doing such things to one another.<br />Salo is only a movie; fiction.  However, we live in a world where people do the same things, and much worse, to one another every day.  But many of us in this country, well-off enough to afford a computer and internet access live in a society very distant from places where very simliar and actual brutality is happening; like Rawanda where people are hacking off one another's limbs, or parts of African where some children are sold into slavery, or parts of the middle east where bombs paid for with our own tax dollars are are falling on people whose only crime is living in a country whose government we despise.<br />Compared to these real horrors, from which many of us are shielded, \\"Salo\\" is hardly an outrage.  And to be outraged by it, but not by the real horrors taking place in our world - or trying to stop them is perhaps precisely the kind of hypocrisy-disguised-as-morality that Passolini and perhaps even de Sade were attempting to address.  We look past the exact same type of human cruelty every day, but justify it to ourselves as necessary, sometimes for the greater (read: our own) good.  It's no accident that Passolini set his movie in fascist Italy, during a time when the horrors portrated in his movie were actually taking place, and people looked the other way.<br />If people are outraged at \\"Salo\\" they are not so much outraged  at what they see in the film as they are at what they see in the mirror that Passolini is holding up to them and the rest of society, even if they do not see the mirror.  If we wish to turn away from the mirror, we may.  But it will not change the reality it reflects.  When the movie is over, the mirror removed, we would do better to change the reality instead of cursing the reflection.: our own) good.

It is interesting to see how the  different boys managed the schooldays .The main persons find a new way to express their feelings because of the new English teacher. He told them to seize the day with poetry. I think it is understandable that some boys, above all Todd, don't feel like the teacher Keating. It is interesting how he change from a shay little boy to a boy who live the poetry and have his own opinion. I think the last scene is really typical for that. Todd is the only who really take part to Mr. Keating.<BR>Neil also is a main person who characterise this story. The passion for the poetry and acting is really refreshing. <BR>The end of this story was really surprising for me. I didn't  count with the death of Neil.

B000000LZV|5.0|I bought this album on vinyl in November of 1985, about a month before D. Boon, the guitarist and lead singer, died in a car wreck.  Since then it has becaome the soundtrack to my adult life.  Far and away, it is the most complete album ever made, woith more quality songs and music than any other recording in history.  It's funny to be so crazy for and committed to an album, but Double Nickles comes from a pure place of inspiration.  It's a punk rock textbook with of great musicianship and songwriting.  If you could imagine an album created by punk poets, this would be it.  If you stumble across this record you should without a doubt buy it and listen right away.  It might change your life too.

B000069HKH|5.0|Boss's first studio offering since 1995 'The ghost of Tom Joad', Fans have been waiting for a great record for a long record. They got it. I always appreciated his music, his words, his musicianship. This record has turned me to his fan. I had a Greatest Hits CD and I bought 'Born to run' almost an year ago, I thought it is a bit overrated. May be expected a lot from his most acclaimed album. This time I did not expect anything. Just listened and listened, liked and loved almost all the songs. It is indeed a very passionate record, an E-street band made it all the more soulful.<br />It starts with rocking 'Lonesome Day'. Short but powerful. He tries some fusion in 'World's Apart' featuring a pakistani Sufi music group. 'You are missing' is heart warming and one of the best songs in the album. Another track 'Further up on the road' has one of the most haunting tunes he has ever written. I humed it for quite a long time after listening to it for the very first time. Overall what we have got a very consistent record that will be counted as one of his top 5 album. <br />It will make me buy a few more of Bruce's album. I have got 'darkness at the edge of town' already. I was thinking about what I read in a magazine. Bruce said 'Two things were most hated in my family, me and my guitar'. Well what an irony it is. Now he is the man whom the whole world loves and respect. This album will solidify all that, but it is not going to make him a legend, only because he already is a legend in his own right.

B000002BMD|5.0|After Richey's disappearance, the band reduced to a trio, released this album. It goes without saying that it is a far more accessible album than 'The Holy Bible'. 'The Holy Bible' was a very angry, pessimistic and dark album having mostly very good songs and some average songs. Here in this album, the lyrics are not as dark as Holy Bible. The songs are more or less accessible and consistent. Best songs here are 'Further away', (which has a teriffic guitar riff in one place) 'Australia', 'Design for life', 'I'm the girl who wanted to be god'. Songs are enegatic and with orchestral arrangement. They have used 3 violins and 2 violas to create that. <br />A very good album. Not surprising that it features in a lot of top 100 albums of all time charts.

Ever since Play's genius on such tracks as \\"Everloving\\", \\"The Sky is broken\\", \\"My Weakness\\" and the commerically successful masterpiece \\"Porcelin\\", I have loved and respected Moby as an artist.  I didn't want to ruin this love with an album some reviewers called crappy.  Yet, I relented and did purchase this album, and, oye, was it to my liking.  The problem I had with Play were it's so called \\"sell-out\\" songs, such as \\"Southside\\".  On this CD, only \\"Jam for the ladies\\" annoys me, and i can deal with it.  This CD has a more meditative mood to it, with songs like fireworks and 18.  My personal favorites are the incredible vocal \\"extreme ways\\" and wonderful \\"one of these mornings\\".

B00005JL78|2.0|Steven Spielberg has joined the ranks of Ridley Scott and Paul Verhoeven in adapting a Philip K. Dick story to the big screen. As such, one would expect a dose of urban dystopia, of cold despairing existentialism, to temper his sentimental streak. It almost does.<br />For most of Minority Report's 146 minute running time, it was beginning to look like Spielberg's considerable cinematic craft was not going to undermine itself. It was taut, suspenseful, and - for the most part - credible, in that the film did not violate its own logic.<br />But even early on, there were cracks starting to appear. For example, pre-crime cop John Anderton (Tom Cruise) has to get back into a secure area unnoticed, so he has his eyes replaced to fool the retinal scanners (this IS the future after all, and such things are possible). He has to do this because he is wanted by the police for a crime he WILL commit in a couple of days, and he is after evidence that he thinks will clear his name. He not only has replaced his eyeballs, but also paralyzed his facial muscles so his countenance will be unrecognizable (although he still looked a lot like Tom Cruise, to me).<br />But then there's the problem of the lock on the door. How do you suppose he gets past? Why, by using his old eyeball fished from a zip-lock bag.<br />Uh...you mean, when a cop is wanted for murder they don't immediately revoke his clearance? Erase his user account from the lock computers? Flag his retinal scan as inoperative? And even if they stupidly failed to do so, would the computer not alert someone that a wanted man had just gotten in? Finally, if he was going to use his own eyeball to gain entry, anyway, why didn't he just LEAVE IT IN HIS HEAD?!<br />Yet, this incredible lapse of logic I was almost willing to forgive, as one amazing set-piece followed another: Gritty future-DC locations. Fascist-looking cops in riot-gear. Cruise missing arrest by the closest of margins. Exciting, noirish stuff, like the best scenes in Blade Runner.<br />Then came the last 20 minutes. I mean, the plot flew apart like a jet engine hit by a frozen turkey. It ends with Cruise explaining everything in a long, dull monolog to the killer. This monolog is necessary for the audience because the third act is so poorly structured that we can't figure it out for ourselves. (Spielberg should have watched Chinatown a couple of times - its complex plot came together clearly with nary a word needed.) Worse, the killer (Max Von Sydow) already KNOWS what Cruise has to say because - DUH! - HE'S THE KILLER! And, of course, the well-oiled machine of the pre-crime unit becomes conveniently rusty (why are there no law-enforcement people at a LAW-ENFORCEMENT CONVENTION?!) to allow time for a nice, long showdown between Cruise and Max Von Sydow.<br />The final insult to the intelligence is when Von Sydow uses a gold-plated ceremonial award pistol as an actual weapon. It even conveniently has live ammunition in its red velvet display case. This last bit is something I would expect from a bad made-for-cable film, not movie that cost the GNP of a small country to make. Sheesh!<br />The technical credits are outstanding, with great special effects and first rate cinematography by Janusz Kaminski. Cruise and Von Sydow are good in their rolls, as are Samantha Morton as the \\"pro-cog\\" Agatha, Jessica Capshaw as Evanna, and Peter Stormare as the creepy eye surgeon.<br />Ultimately, though, it just doesn't hold up.

038533558X|5.0|I jumped and had my jaw drop several times in the first 50 pages... yeh, there are similarities to the plot of &quot;Tell No One&quot;, but this is Coben's style... If you like to follow twists and turns, action that moves and offers surprising interaction between characters, &quot;Gone For Good&quot; and Coben is for you... Just as an aside, I read a couple of other reviews that offered somewhat less glowing remarks. Critical of this being too similarity to Coben's other work... well duh?, I can't stand when authors like Coben, David Baldacci for instance, want to take us down a syrupy stroll through their childhood in the foothills of West Virginia.  I for one buy an artist\authors work multiple times, because their genre and style are pleasing.  This is a GREAT, fun, quick read!

B00004XONN|5.0|Enter Radiohead, the quintet from Oxford who had just released one of the most spellbinding incredible album of the 1990's, one which might better signify the era more than the heralded and rightfully so Nevermind by Nirvana. The saviours of rock and roll music are here in an interstellar burst. What does Radiohead do? Toss any considerations of rock and roll music in the garbage and make one of the most pure and dignifying statements in music history. And there are millions of people who hate this album, think it's [...], etc.<br />I can understand why, because when I first heard the opening 5 notes of \\"Everything in its Right Place\\", I was puzzled, I hear some type of blurred synthesizer, backwards alien vocals, all foreign to my ears. Yet, when you listen to the whole album through, it is the most rewarding musical experience I have ever had. Ecclectic isn't the word to describe it, I would have to use the word limitless. There are no boundries to this album, not limited by a guitar and Thom's beautiful vocals. Rather, Thom might edit his vocals using Pro Tools, and create a computerized version of his voice as seen in the title track. \\"The National Anthem\\" consists of a simple bass riff which is built and textured in swarming and swooping horns. In the middle of the whole mess, you can hear Thom's relentless \\"Turn it off!\\". \\"How to Disappear\\" is one of the most honest songs I have ever heard. Thom's lyrics here are the closest to autobiographical I can find. \\"I'm not here, this isn't happening\\" - this is Thom's rock and roll existence, and how inhuman being a music celebrity actually is \\"Strobe lights and blown speakers - fireworks and hurricanes\\". Thom's falsetto prevails over the uneasy strings at the end of song, which probably is the most memorable moment of the album for me. \\"Treefingers\\" has been well described by many of the readers. It is simiar ambience that you might hear on Brian Eno's Music for Airports album. It really calms the listening down before the brooding \\"Optimistic\\" - which might be most reminiscent of the old Radiohead. There is a little mini jam session before the arpeggios of \\"In Limbo\\" where in the end Thom's voice is suctioned into nothingness, and only droned fragments of sound remain. \\"Idioteque\\" is simply one of the most profound statements ever made by a rock and roll group, and I still haven't decideded if they did it right. There is a sense of panic and stupidity in Idioteque, making it similar to a dance track, yet so clever and beautiful, it leaves me confused between it's anti-cliche and it's musical aspects. \\"Morning Bell\\" features a stuttering snare and guitar feedback which builds up until Thom's \\"Cut the kids in half\\" line. Jibberish flows out of Thom's mouth as the song rebuilds and instrumentals take over and resolve. Finally, \\"Motion Picture Soundtrack\\" combines organ and harp to create a beautiful piece where Thom bows out with \\"I will see you, in the next life\\". There is a minute of silence before a beautiful ambient sound concludes that you have listened to a musical masterpiece. <br />And yet.. some people don't like it
0790749998|3.0|Jet Li's film \\"Romeo Must Die\\" is not a translation of \\"Romeo and Juliet,\\" it just mirrors the story a little. That's fine with me, as long as I get my fight scenes. There are tons of fight scenes in this movie and therefore, reasons to be pleased. My big complaint, though, is that not for one minute do we doubt that Li can't handle the black gangsta bad guys in this movie. They're too easy to beat up and provide no challenge for him. But his chemistry with Aaliyah works well as she was a good actress and had a nice screen presence. Li's acting isn't that good, but what do you expect? Oscar-winning performances? The guy whispers half his lines, for crying out loud! Overall, \\"Romeo Must Die\\" is a treat for the martial-arts fan in all of us.

A one year subscription to Money magazine would be better spent if you are truly a novice and are interested in portfolio analysis.<br />Graham gives little insight to the market, focusing on how building your portfolio with bonds and stocks for long-term (ie. buy and hold) growth.  Does anyone still believe that garbage?  If they do have they held thru last debacle in the market and made money?<br />Perhaps Graham has great things to say, but alas, not here.
B00006CXXU|4.0|You know I've never been a Christina fan at all. Coming from the R&B Background. Rock has never been a selection in my music favorites. However for christmas my best friend brought me the C.D. Stripped. And I must say I really enjoyed the C.D. Especially \\"Impossible\\" written by Ms. Keys. and in the song \\"Walk Away' christina proved she has what it takes to not just be labeled a Rock Artist , but an artist Who demands to be heard and let you know she's no longer a teenager she's a grown woman .And I was sold when I Heard the tracks \\"Voice Within\\"  and \\"Sing my song\\". I can't stop playing the cd I enjoy it just that much. I have to say if the next C.D is anything like this one. Then I'll be adding it to my collection.
0316666343|2.0|It's a little sad to watch literature blend in with the movies so inexorably, while the two or three multi-nationals that own EVERYTHING crank up the publicity machine for the next \\"big\\" book. This isn't a badly-written novel, but I do think it's awfully calculated, and that it takes virtually all its cues from successful movies; it's got a serial killer/rapist right out of Silence of the Lambs, but it also solves that immediately by having the narrator be telling the story from heaven (complete with a \\"Here Comes Mr. Jordan\\" facilitator named Franny). And of course the idea of an unsolved murder and the people affected by it being observed by the ghost of the victim, who is even occasionally able to \\"break through\\" and make his/her presence known, has been done quite a few times before, most notably in the 80s with \\"Ghost.\\" All this needed was a wacky African-American character to perfectly fulfill its by-the-numbers approach. If you can enjoy this without feeling condescended to, you probably also think you know what feng shui is just because you saw a piece about it on \\"20-20\\" and feel free to describe your religion as \\"spiritual.\\" Claptrap, ultimately, and you'd do just as well to wait and see the film version (already in development). There's more originality displayed on just about any episode of \\"Law and Order.\\" But it was easy to read, and very, very quick (by about the middle of the book, it's almost impossible not to start flipping pages).
0345409671|1.0|As a big fan of the first four Vampire Chronicles books I was extremely disappointed by this book. The author spent too much time preaching a rather unusual theological perspective and lost the main flow of the story. I found myself skipping huge sections of text without missing any of the plot. The Chronicles have always had a theological aspect to them, but it never consumed the story until this book. Your time would be better spent reading or re-reading the first four books in this series, particularly the second one.
0440180295|3.0|The Children's Crusades was, by far the most, boring and slow progressing book I have ever endured. When I first decided to read this novel I believed it would be interesting and exciting and after having done so I realize that it is as far from that as possible. <BR>             While in he process of reading Slaughterhouse 5, I could hardly keep my focus.  I, very begrudgingly, finished the novel, due to the fact that I later had to hand in a paper showing that I had actually finished the novel. <BR>           Although I did not like the book, its plot or the way it flowed, I did however enjoy some aspects of the author's writing style. His ability to show the characters emotions in each situation and such was, for lack of better wording, amazing.  The main character was struggling through his ability to be \\"unstuck\\" in time, and the way the author emulates to the audience how he is breaking down from the emotional roller-coaster ride that he has been forced to endure.<BR>              All in all, I would recommend this book to someone who enjoys something of the more \\"far-out\\", science-fiction nature.  It is not however for those who enjoy fast- paced or clearly written books. <BR>                 Even thought it is true that I did not enjoy this long and slow novel, I will however try to read other books by the same author due to the fact that his writing style is somewhat intriguing. <BR>         My review may not agree with that of  other readers of Slaughterhouse 5, this is my personal opnion. I would suggest to read, by one's self to form a different personal opinion than that of mine.
B00005JL2O|5.0|This movie is an excellent capper to the Austin Powers series.  Any movie that makes me laugh again and again upon each viewing is worth 10 stars, but I'm into this sort of sophomoric humor, Bond satire, and the 60's.<br />The only reason I'm writing this review is to warn other potential buyers that the Infifilm encoding on this disc may choke your DVD player.  Specifically, on my Panasonic DVD-RV31 this movie plays great when viewed straight through.  However, shortly after you start playing the movie the Forward Scan, Reverse Scan, and even the Pause button are disabled.  The DVD player sees these buttons and puts up the \\"can't do that now\\" icon on the upper-right of my TV screen.  It is interesting to note that if you start playing this movie from the main menu you can forward scan all you want, but once you reach the position you're interested in watching and play it for, say, a minute, the Forward, Reverse, and Pause buttons are locked-out.<br />I've never tried to use the Infinifilm extras:  this problem exists when you simply try to view as a regular DVD and simply want to back the film up or pause, or skip forward.  <br />At least one other reviewer of the movie reported this same problem, but blamed it on the disc.  I'm suggesting that it could be a problem with certain Panasonic players, or a very unfortunate combination of issues:  perhaps Infinifilm is attempting to exploit features on this disc that are in a gray-area of the DVD standard and Panasonic implemented those features in a slightly different way from expected.<br />We have viewed two other Infinifilm DVDs on our Panasonic with no apparent problems:  13 days and Rush Hour 2.  But, again, we never tried to use the extras, so the Goldmember disk is definitely unique.<br />The bottom line:  rent or borrow this movie and test it out on your machine before buying it.  Then, get it!!!  It's Hilarious!!!

0061001783|4.0|Georgette Heyer fans, don't scold!<BR>Compared to pretty much anything else, \\"Cotillion\\" would be five stars.   But compared to Heyer--aha!  It isn't as good as \\"Venetia\\" or \\"Frederica\\" or ....Well, pick your own favorites.<BR>If  you haven't read anything by Georgette Heyer,  it's all right to start with \\"Cotillion.\\"  It's a lovable, humorous book.  It might even turn out to be your favorite.<BR>The story begins with pretty Kitty (a penniless orphan) and her crotchety, wealthy grandfather.   This old man is determined to control the story--which immediately slips away from him.  He has summoned his great-nephews--Kitty's cousins--to his estate to inform them that the man who marries Kitty will be his heir.  You'd think he would know better, wouldn't you?  After all, what he really wants isn't just any marriage; he wants his rakehell nephew Jack to marry Kitty.  Like any self-respecting rake, Jack is determined not to be driven into marriage, not even a marriage that he's willing to enter.  Eventually.   The one thing the two men agree on is that Kitty doesn't need a season.  Grandpapa doesn't want to spend the money; Jack thinks that Kitty will come to no harm vegetating in the country until he's finished sowing his wild oats. <br />Mortified, Kitty impulsively (she's seventeen, and half French) runs away from home.  True, she loves Jack; he's handsome and dashing--but he doesn't  want to marry her.<br />And at the inn where she waits for the stage she finds her cousin Freddie.  Not a great deal in his cockloft, as he would quickly agree.  Not a patch on Jack.   He's willowy, rabbity, fearful.  He's at the inn because he wants what he knows he won't get at Grandpapa's table: a good meal.  This time it's Kitty's turn to plot.  Will dear, good Freddie pretend to be engaged to her, and take her to London?  <br />Yes, he would, once he gets it through his head that  he isn't expected to announce the engagement or actually get married.  The scene in which he \\"proposes\\"is a delight.  Jack, of course, realizes that the betrothal is another way to push him toward matrimony, and won't play.  Freddie takes Kitty home to mother--in London.  Together mother and son set about giving Kitty a season.  <br />As usual, Heyer sets up this situation quickly, deftly, and in this case with a good deal of humor at the expense of all four main characters.  But the heart of the story is in the development of Kitty and Freddie, once they  are in London.  Kitty begins to grow up, and she begins to see Freddie in his element.  With all his flaws, Freddie is nevertheless extremely good \\"ton.\\"  His taste is perfect, and he knows all the nuances of the complicated game that comprises a London season.  <br />I suppose you have questions. Does Kitty find new suitors?  Does Jack come to heel?  Does her season meet Kitty's expectations?  How does Heyer fill up the rest of the novel?<BR>Well, don't ask me!  Read the book for yourself.  And then, when you are thinking that the idiot reviewer should have given it five stars,  read more Heyer.

Buy this book early and read it often!

The only thing I didn't like was the way that it all ended up turning.  I had hope for the best.  Overall apperance though was great!
B000002J1C|5.0|Words almost fail me. I grew up with this on vinyl LP, played it more or less daily, and was one of the first CD's I bought when music started going digital in the latter 1980's. The new remasters offered here sound like the band just recorded the tracks last week, and hearing the album anew makes you wonder what the hell is wrong with most bands these days. Honestly -- doesn't anyone care about creating music that will LAST as well as sell a million units? This music was recorded THIRTY THREE YEARS AGO, and makes your average 2003 era rock band sound like a bunch of lazy deadbeats posing for groupies.<br />What I will always refer to as as \\"Side One\\" of the record [the first three tracks from the CD] are among Album Oriented Rock's finest moments -- the best non Beatles Side One ever, maybe, with ZERO weaknesses. \\"Yours Is No Disgrace\\" is some sort of magical time machine disguised as a song; No way is that ten minutes long. It feels more like about three, has the energy needed to overcome any hangover or bad hair day, and remains a breathtaking example of what you can do with stereo sound if you just think a little. \\"The Clap\\" is an over the top display of guitar prowess by Steve Howe that still leaves my jaw hanging open in awe of his abilities and awareness of what different sounds a simple acoustic guitar can make: it doesn't even seem like he's really trying, just sort noodling away for a few minutes while the other band members catch a break during a concert. I'd love to hear him play a banjo -- he'd blow that mutant kid from \\"Deliverance\\" right out of the water.<br />And then there is \\"Starship Troopers\\", the first extended art rock hit of the 70's, and still a staple of AOR classic rock the world over. With its different sections, flawless musical performances and angelic harmonies with John Anderson's Aquarian age lyrical content that defies literal interpretation, \\"Starship Troopers\\" represents a moment in musical history when everything fell together in just the perfect order at just the right time -- this song may be Yes' most important contribution to our culture, \\"Roundabout\\" not withstanding. If I ever fly on the space shuttle, I am going to make them play the closing segment during countdown so that we blast off at just the right moment. You can actually feel the speakers of your stereo moving the air particles around them as they kick the bottom into overdrive during the climax.<br />\\"Side Two\\" [or the final three tracks] is a little weaker, but good gravy ... \\"Your Move/All Good People\\" remains a cherished radio hit, even though I have personally never really cared for it [too sappy], and \\"Perpetual Change\\" was an experiment in audio technology that still boggles my mind as to how they even thought up the idea of merging two different takes into the big climax. Only Bill Bruford could have calculated that beat and nailed it right down to the quarter second on dual tracks. Truly amazing, even though the song does go on for a bit longer than it needed to.<br />Special personal mention must be made of \\"A Venture\\", which remains one of the most haunting little ditties in my collection of Things I Cling Onto From My Youth. To this very day I wish that I could hear the \\"entire\\" take of this song, which seems to have been faded out just as the band was starting to go somewhere with it. Steve Howe's non-distorted \\"jazz\\" guitar counterpointed by Tony Kaye's grand piano was sadly underutilized, and the solo Howe starts churning out as the piece ends might have even put old Bob Fripp to shame. Maybe the \\"extra tracks\\" version will fulfill my wish when it is released this spring ... a seven minute version of \\"A Venture\\" would make 2003 for me.<br />Oddly enough, one of the reasons why I am so fond of \\"The Yes Album\\" and \\"A Time And A Word\\" both is the ABSENCE of Rick Wakeman. The band represented on these two records was a much more organic outfit, whereas the Wakeman era Yes offerings seem rigidly composed and lackingspontineity. Maybe one of the reasons why I like \\"A Venture\\" so much is that they do just seem to be \\"jamming\\" as the piece concludes; Rick Wakeman era Yes didn't \\"jam\\" in an organic manner, they executed compositions.<br />I also simply love the sound of Tony Kaye's organ and moog synthesizer on \\"Yours Is No Disgrace\\" and especially \\"Starship Troopers\\", where his bass pedal and Chris Squries' filtered bass guitar provide a bottom to the sound that really flings it into orbit. While I don't begrudge Yes for replacing Kaye with the much broader talented Wakeman, there is something very special about the albums on which Kaye appeared that Yes never seemed to be able to recapture -- a sense of innocence, perhaps. Much fuss is made of this being Steve Howe's first record with Yes, but I prefer to think of it as Tony Kaye's last Yes album, and have always wondered what became of the electric organ he used when recording it. That sucker belongs in a museum, and Kaye should be Knighted.<br />I cannot recommend this disc enough -- if you know someone who likes rock music, buy it for them. If you have the old Atlantic issued CD, you owe yourself a copy of the remastered takes. And when the \\"bonus edition\\" is released I expect you to pick up a copy of that too ... \\"The Yes Album\\" will still be relevant for another thirty three years no matter what happens to the planet or universe, and the same can not be said for many of it's contemporaries. While \\"Close To The Edge\\" is probably classic Yes' bona-fide masterpiece and \\"Fragile\\" their biggest commercial hit, \\"The Yes Album\\" will always be my favorite of their records, no debate.<br />Five stars all the way.spontineity.

B0000062FL|5.0|A few years ago Time magazine published a list of the best albums of the (last) century. The top rated CD was Bob Marley's Exodus, followd by Miles Davis' Kind of Blue, then the Jimi Hendrix Experience. Obviously these things come down to personal taste, but I have all three of these albums, and I would put this one at the same level.<br />The things that really distinguish the sound of Santana are the latin rythyms and percussion section behind the high pitced guitar of Carlos Santana who solos in a style that is both melodic and intensely rhymthmic. This style reaches its acme on hot numbers like Black Magic Woman, Oye Como Va, and Samba Pa Ti, but there is tremendous intensity in the whole album.<br />This edition includes an add-on of three numbers recorded in London more or less contemporaneously with the album, so you get a nice little live concert as a bonus. I'm not sure that this adds much to the original shortish album, but it takes nothing away.<br />I am insufficiently expert to comment on the sound engineering, but when I first owned this album it was on cassette tape and played on a transistor cassette/radio. It sounded fine. In this version it sounds fine to me both in my car and on the Bose system I use at home.<br />Carlos Santana had enjoyed something of a commercial rennaissance in recent years, no doubt due to demographics favoring the latin pop movement that includes others like Ricky Martin, Christine Aguilera, etc., but this is his greatest album, and the one that made him famous. If you listen to it, you will understand why.<br />As I have posted a number of reviews, here is what I mean by my star ratings:<br />* A really worthless CD<br />** A CD that has some good stuff, but some major defects.<br />*** An OK CD that will please fans of the artist in question.<br />**** An excellent CD that represents the best work of the artist in question and can be bought with confidence.<br />***** An absolute classic that is the best, or among the best, of its genre. Your collection should start here., of its genre. Your collection should start here.

B00005JKZT|5.0|The Two Towers (TTT) is NOT a sequel to the mind-blowing Fellowship of the Ring, but a second part of a 3 act play. So does it live up to it's high expectations? Yes, the magic is still here, but is much darker (and bloodier) this time. Director Peter Jackson puts up right back where we left and doesn't look back. 3 hours later our mind is once again filled with dramatic, vast images that are instant cinematic history and legend. This is the fabric that geek legend is wove of.<br />Jackson and his team have said they took the most liberties with the story in TTT, and it definitely shows. I'll predict some major backlash from Tolkien purists. I can see both side's arguments and probably lean toward the purists side. There are some changes that obviously put some story angles further up (the Aragorn/Arwen romance) and change some characters (Faramir). The changes still work in the movie and someone who hasn't read the books countless times (like myself) wouldn't think the story doesn't work because it works for both arenas of people.<br />When we left them, the Fellowship was breaking. The hobbits, Frodo and his loyal companion Sam, have ran off to Mordor while Merry and Pippin have been captured by a group of Uruk-Hai warriors. The man Aragorn, elf Legolas, and dwarf Gimli have decided to try to rescue the hobbits that are captured and let the ring-bearer off to his task. Gandalf the Grey had fallen into the abyss and Boromir had perished at the hands of the Uruks.<br />The film kicks into high gear right off with a bang starting that I won't reveal. It then darts back to our Mordor bound hobbits, who are all but lost in the vast wastelands of their trek, but they aren't alone. The creature Gollum finally reveals himself and agrees to lead them to the Black Gate with a promise on his \\"precious\\", the one ring. The 3 hunters (man, elf, dwarf) chase their prey across the lands of Rohan where they only seem to meet despair and hopelessness.<br />Gollum is a totally CG character that is more real than you could imagine, but not because of the fantastic work by WETA Digital, but because he has personality and depth as a character. He is the most fully realize movie creature since Yoda. Jackson has captured the wear the ring put on him in the 100s of years he possessed it, but more importantly the inner struggle he faces from his old self, Smeagol. It would not have been possible if Andy Serkis had not capture the essence of the character perfectly with not only the voice, but also with the actions that the digital double was created from.<br />The vast majority of the new areas of Middle Earth we are introduced to revolve around the land of Rohan, where King Theoden resides, but is ever sinking under the arm of the wizard Saruman through his spy, Grima Wormtounge. Theoden's son has died and his heir, nephew Eomer, has been made an outcast while his niece Eowyn tries to save him the best he can. There were characters I really loved in the book and their are just as gripping onscreen. Bernard Hill captures the lost glory of Theoden King who has to convinced Middle Earth is even worth his effort to defend. Miranda Otto perfectly captures the beauty, and most importantly the longing of Eowyn, who is constantly trying to counteract the sliminess of Brad Dourif's spectacular Wormtounge performance.<br />The story also introduces us to the Ents, Middle Earth's oldest living creatures, when Merry and Pippin run from their captors and into (onto) Treebeard, the eldest of the old. The Ents are the tree-herders in Fangorn Forest from ancient tales long forgotten and even they've nearly forgotten that they themselves are part of Middle Earth and are under threat from their neighbor Saruman. Here is where the film really takes off as the 3 hunters encounter the White Wizard in Fangorn Forest, but it is an old friend returned. He tells them their hobbits are safe and they must come with him and save the king in Rohan before all is lost.<br />Ian McKellen once again is engrossing as Gandalf in his return, but is different as his color notes. He is more wise, but more wizard like and less human than before. He knows his ultimate task is before him as does Viggo Mortensen as Aragorn whose character forces you to grasp his nobility and as he excepts his destiny. Orlando Bloom is once again back as our favorite bow & knives wielding Elf while his unique friendship with Gilmi  the dwarf continues to grow. Gimli has a series of one liners and wise cracks that truthfully never grow tiring probably because John Rhys Davies is such a lovable character actor. They prove their worth to each other at the battle of Helm's Deep, which can only be summed up as possibly the best onscreen combat I've ever seen. Jackson does wonders capturing both the vast scope of the battle and the human elements making it up.<br />To say the film is film is visually pleasing is quite the understatement. The artistic details within the film's locations is surely unmatched it today's cinema, if ever. The cinematography is awe-inspiring and sweeps you into the vast lands of Middle Earth. They always seem to have the perfect shot, whether close or sweeping zoom and fade, to convey the feeling they tried to get across to the viewer. The visual effects are more than satisfactory with the Ents joining Gollum as imagination come to life, as well as the 10,000 strong orc army at Helm's Deep.<br />The best thing Peter Jackson has done in these 2 films is challenge the audience to expect more out of movies and to prove that there is still much that movies can do. He's energized fantasy fans and general moviegoers alike and that in itself is a miracle. The action sequences are huge and the humanity is there to match it, which is probably what makes these films so pleasing in every which way.McKellen once again is engrossing as Gandalf in his return, but is different as his color notes.

The rest is  just fill consisting of the kind of writing one might put in a personal journal not intended for publication by reason of its lack of organization and poor editing.  He may be a great trader but he is an inexperienced, sub-average author.   Accordingly it may be sufficient to merely read the excerpts and then skip the book.

B000069HKH|5.0|Every once in a while you find that magical piece of music that never gets old.  i'm sitting here listening to The Rising for the what seems like millionth time.  it still excites me.  Lonesome Day, title track, My City of Ruins, You're Missing, The Fuse, Mary's Place, Empty Sky, Into the Fire all are fantastic rock music.  But the albums best moment happens on track #7--Worlds Apart.  This songs is an achievement.  Beginning with the sounds of qawwali, the intense, God-conjuring, life-affirming vocal music of the mystical Sufi sect of Islam - a branch of the faith much detested (and often suppressed) by death-trumpeting fundamentalist imams and ending with Bruce torturing his guitar to hear its crying.  It is a goosebump song.  It may not be the best album of the year but it is certainly a joy to listen to and a gift from Bruce and the E Street Band.
B000001G6W|2.0|I just don't get it. Why is it that the 9th is considered to be the very peak of Western classical music? Its appeal totally escapes me. Some of the orchestration is very nice, but good orchestration does not a good symphony make. Alfred Hitchcock once said that you need three essential ingredients to make a good film: a good script, a good script, and a good script. I say you need three essential ingredients to make a good symphony: a good tune, a good tune, and a good tune. The 9th lacks just that. You wont exactly find yourself humming the 9th after listening to it. In fact, you wont even find yourself humming it while you are listening. The melodies are boring, the rhythams heavy and pondorous, and the movements are waaaaay too long. What the 9th needs is a good editor to rein it in to half an hour, and he could cut out that wretched choral thing at the end as well. No criticism should be leveled at Karajan and the boys. They do an excellent job with lousy material. In fact, the BPO does a slightly quicker version than is normally the case. Makes you wonder if Karajan himself thinks it is a little on the lengthy side. After listening to this, you find yourself having to listen to &quot;Camper&quot; van Beethoven's 5th and 6th in order to reaffirm your faith in classical music. Ahh, the 5th and 6th. Now there you have two glorious pieces of music.

0596000480|5.0|It explains things very well and actually has pretty good examples of what they are trying to portray. This book isnt for a complete newbie. I bought another book called New Perspectives on creating web pages with HTML and XML by Patrick Carey. <br />When I finished everything in this book made sense. I have had some beginners C++ programming under my belt. Ifs Whiles, doWhiles, Fors, Forins arent to hard to understand. Its very basic logic that non programmers can understand. I also like how they explain objects on chapter 8.  <br />Overall this book is real good. It explains everything well. It may not be for the complete beginner but you will need this later on so rather than take this book back the beginners should invest in a tutorial style book like A Beginners Guide to JavaScript and then read this book and everything will be crystal clear. I thought I might change my mind on this book after I got an intro to javascript. I also like the fact that it's a great reference.
B00005JLF5|5.0|While I have watched and enjoyed all of the Star Trek series, Deep Space Nine is undoubtedly the best Star Trek series so far. I am SO pleased that it to be released on DVD and continuously monitor Amazon.co.uk on this side of the Atlantic, hoping to see a release date. Paramount - take note please!! When one thinks of DS9, character depth and development, and amazing storyline arcs are what make it a classy show. And what an opening theme - Dennis McCarthy has certainly set the standard which NOBODY has come close to surpassing! I cannot wait for a Deep Space Nine revival in my home - hopefully in the not-too-distant future.
0316666343|1.0|Unfortunately, I bought this book in hardcover based on the buzz surrounding it.  I found it disjointed (no pun intended) and in need of one more draft.  While the plot is unique it is not well developed.  Though I did enjoy the concept the author proposes of an individual heaven before being admited to the big show, I thought the development of the plot on earth was weak.  Just my thoughts.
B000066NW0|5.0|This CD rocks!!! Its 1 of the best... and for all the ppl who think otherwise... well theyr just losers, they dont have any taste. I think avril is a great singer with alot of talent. And this CD is worth buyin.
0060392886|4.0|For Christmas Katie gave me one of the most anti-hardcore biographies you could ever read. Ever since I saw this Motley Crue biography on the shelves I've wanted to read it. I'm not really sure why I felt the need to read this thing, it was just something deep down telling me that this could be a good story. I've always been intrigued by the VH1 Behind The Music specials on all the bands from the 80s, and I figured this book would just be a more detailed Behind The Music. <br />I'll start this off by telling you that I read all 400 pages in two sittings. I could not put this book down! I have just recently read \\"Our Band Could Be Your Life\\" and it told the stories of Minor Threat, Black Flag, Husker Du, etc, and then after reading about the indie struggles of those bands I changed to the over-the-top glam rock of Motley Crue. Surprisingly \\"The Dirt\\" was just as good, if not better, than \\"Our band...\\". The story isn't written by an auther looking in on the bands and supplying you with his thoughts and observations of the band. Instead this book is written by the band and others that are close to them. With this book you know you are reading the stories the exact way that they happened. Not only do the band members chime in with their tales of debauchery, but others like the tour managers, label executives, and managers get to share their stories of how their lives were scarred by the crazy foursome. <br />Unlike some of their hair metal peers Motley Crue's story actually starts with them as a struggling poor band living in a rat-infested apartment. But their similarities with struggling punk bands end there. Even during their poor times Crue partied like they were rock stars. Every night their apartment turned into one giant party complete with girls, drugs, and every other rock star thing you could think of. From the start the band plowed through girls and drugs like there would be no tomorrow. Since the whole story is written by the band you can get a real feel forjust decadent this band could get. The stories range from doing obscene things with girls like you've only heard about in the Led Zeppelin stories to sleeping with nasty girls for no other reason than they wanted to sleep with someone. It's amazing to me how these guys managed to escape the 80s disease free. <br />After the band finally gets big, all of their vices increase threefold. This is when the story really picks up. The band has a constant flow of alchohol, drugs, and women coming in and out of their lives. One particular story finds the guys at a fancy Thai restaurant where for dessert the waiters bring out silver platters and when they lift the lid off of the platter the band is greeted with seven lines of Coke. The whole story I'm sitting there thinking \\"I can't believe this stuff actually happened!\\" <br />As the story progresses you find the band maturing, changing members, changing sounds, and entering rehab over and over and over again. The story gets pretty in-depth with the Tommy Lee/Pamela Anderson fiasco, which should be pretty interesting for all of you that follow entertainment news and/or watched their infamous video. Somehow these ugly looking, makeup wearing glam guys end up with some of the most beautiful women in the world. Whether it's actresses, models, or porn stars, they've had them all. Towards the end of the story is where my interest started to decrease. As the band settled down into married life, sobered up, and had children, their stories became less and less decadent. At this point I should have been happy that everything turned out great for the band, but instead I was sitting there waiting for the band to do something stupid and screw it all up. It seems that the band has turned their lives around which is good for them, but makes for less-than-exciting reading. If I wanted to know about happy marriages with kids I could just look around me. I wanted to read this book to read about all their crazy antics. Luckily, most of the book focuses on the pre-settling down years and is a great book to read. <br />I know this book isn't going to be the most \\"hardcore\\" book in your collection, but it's a great tale of a bands rise to stardom and all of the rock star things that go along with it. Today's superstars seem to hide the fact that they indulge in all of these vices, so it's great to see a band embracing their past and telling their story to a whole new generation.<br />So next time you get the feeling like you are in a rock star mood, go out and buy this book and give it a shot. If nothing else you can laugh at how all the band slept with the other band members girls and read their reactions when they find out for the first time through this book. This book is definatly worth the money, go get it...
0060523794|4.0|Surely, Mr. Gerstner wouldn't (or can't) reveal all the details and secrets about how he and the IBM people turned this American icon around. However, the last few chapters are worth reading and make the modern business people think over and over again.
B0000028M7|5.0|I really don't know what to say.  I'm a Stone Temple Pilots fan and only bought this album because Alice In Chains are always compared with them, I sure wasn't disappointed!  You could easily compare this album to STP's \\"Core.\\"  \\"Them Bones\\", \\"Rooster\\", \\"Rain When I Die\\", these are all great songs.  <br />The only other thing I have to add, is that I think Layne Staley could have written much better lyrics to replace his chanting about drugs.  This guy was an amazing lyric writer on the non-drug related songs on this album.  RIP<br />Also, Jerry Cantrell seems to be a good guitarist, but I don't think he plays to his full potential on this album.<br />I definatley recommend it to anybody reading this review, and I myself am going to have to check out mor Alice In Chains albums.
B000002J09|5.0|When put into context with other albums from the same year, it is quite apparent why this album stands head and shoulders above the pack - and why it is so popular. I can still remember this album being in the charts - in the 1980's!<br />It was thanks to Mr Moon of The Who, a man that despised this group as many (recent) reviewers here seem to, that this group acquired its legendary name. So you detractors just keep on comin' - just because you don't like it does not make it any less great. In fact, just because it raises such strong feelings one way or the other, this makes it a great work of art alongside the Sex Pistols \\"Nevermind...\\". You don't have to like it - or even agree. You just need strong feelings from the work.<br />Modern bands like Limp Bizkit may have a good, polished production and some nice riffs, but there's no depth to their music, and many people are simply indifferent to them. Next year, you'll listen to something else, and LB will sound dated. LZ, on the other hand, reward the frequent listener with new discoveries in their music. This music will never sound dated - just music of its time.<br />One problem is that it is SO popular that some people are somewhat over saturated with it - you can have too much of a good thing, after all.<br />The ambience of John Bonhams drums stands out particularly on this recording - rumour has it that each track was recorded in different rooms in the mansion in which it was recorded, to get different sounds. When The Levee Breaks illustrates this perfectly. Compare the sounds with those in Stairway, Black Dog or Rock And Roll.<br />In fact, throw away all your old preconceptions. Listen to Bach, jazz, whatever - something completely different for about 10 minutes, then run the gauntlet by playing this album all the way through from start to finish, with the lights down low. Don't just hear it - LISTEN. You may well discover then what some people have known for years. This album IS truly great.<br />Anyone who thinks this is \\"Hippy nonsense\\" needs to get a life.<br />Anyone who hasn't heard this music (can there really be anyone left who hasn't?) should buy this as an essential part to any music collection, and bring it out every once in a while and \\"run the gauntlet\\". <br />ENJOY!
B000001FDQ|5.0|So you think you can play anything on guitar eh...well good luck with this! I heard that this guy was a good guitarist, but I never imagined THIS! There are no words to desribe Malmsteen's beautiful guitar riffs. It sounds like God himself is playing. I recommend this album to any good guitarist who's looking to improve their skills. Or this album could be used as relaxation music, to fall asleep to or something becuase the guitar is quite beautiful.<br />If you're thinking what I did when I first heard about this album (it's gonna be boring because only two tracks have singing on them) you couldn't be more wrong!  In fact, these are the weakest songs on the album and you're gonna wish that there was no singing on them!<br />There is no way you can go wrong with this album, you're gonna listen to it again and again and again.
006441034X|5.0|Too bad I can only give 5 stars to Howl's Moving Castle; it deserves far more. I'm a voracious reader, with 20 or 30 shelves full of books, and Howl's Moving Castle is my favorite of all of them. What makes it so great? For starters, the vivid characters are wonderful. They have such strong personalities that they almost become caricatures, but then Ms. Jones tosses in a little detail that makes them human. I especially love Howl, the outrageously foppish, over-dramatic, slitherer-outer of a wizard. Another thing that is wonderful about Howl's Moving Castle is all the tiny references to fairy-tale conventions, other works, the modern world (specifically in Wales), and even old poetry. A third thing to love about Howl's Moving Castle is the sheer amount of levels. I would estimate that I've read it 50 or 60 times, and I always catch something new each time I read it. It's hilarious and sweet. Even fantasy-haters that I made read this book loved it. It's seriously for everyone. I love Howl's Moving Castle; now the wait is on for the 2004 or 2005 animated movie by world-famous animation studio Studio Ghibli!

6304712944|5.0|An exceptional adaptation of a hit Broadway musical about the legend of King Arthur's mistily-remembered reign in the time of chivalrous knighthood and England's transition from the Dark Ages into the Enlightenment.  The plot is magnigficent, opening with a capering Richard Harris, whose introductory scenes are so over the top and mincey that even the most enlightened boyfriend/hubby will find his fingers wandering for the remote or searching for a brewski.  But King Arthur, like the film, gathers gravitas as the story unfolds... The classic triangle between Arthur, Guinnevere and Lancelot is retold as a parable for the civilizing of England itself -- Arthur allows himself to be cuckholded not for his love of a friend (which is the traditional view), but because to seek revenge would be to slide back into the might-makes-right barbarity and rule by force that he seeks to supplant as king of the newly unified England.  As a figurehead, he is trapped in more ways than one, and his character squirms painfully under our gaze, like a butterfly on a collector's pin.  The mix of humor and pathos is deftly played, and by the end, we're all swept up by the inevitable, inexorable tragedy, yet can still relish Harris' lusty hamminess.  I'm not that knowlegable about musical theatre, but I thought this film was swell.
B00005ATQH|1.0|Hi,<BR>I have a copy of Lolita released by WarnerVideo. Its running time goes for only 147 minutes - the original goes for 152 minutes. Why has this movie of 1962 been cut in this way.<BR>How can I obtain a version of this movie that runs for the whole time.<br />thanks.
B000067DNC|5.0|I would just like to say that I love Stargate and I also can't wait for the rest to be released.  I would also like to add that the SciFi Channel is running all of the episodes in order every Monday night.  I am at least greatful for that, so that I can follow the show.
B000005JA8|1.0|This album is what snipe hunting must be like.  Everyone SWEARS that it's great fun - and they can't imagine why you're not enjoying it...<br />What a joke.
B00005AQE8|5.0|Just as the title says, this is the greatest gangsta rap of all time.  There is not a song on it that does not hit your nerve in some way.  People talk about how Pac was a bad person, he was a man that lived his life the way it was meant to be lived.  I truly feel sorry for any one person that does not have the joy of experience Tupac Amaru Shakur and his music.  None of Pacs CD's are bad but this one stands out.  He could have put each of the songs out as singles and hit it huge with them.  To me, this shows how a man can raise up from the ghetto and make a life for himself.  It may have been a Thug Life but it is still a life that he was proud of.  Always Picture him Rollin'
B00006JDVV|1.0|The title says it all but, I'll elaborate. I expected to see a flick with a premise similar to Independence Day involving our advanced technology versus a mysterious unknown power such as what these dragons presented. Instead the directors of this film decided to show us a damp dreary post apocolyptic environment of an english community  hiding from these dragons until confronted by a bunch of American Rough necks headed by Mathew M. who try to convince  them to fight against this foe. <BR>How stupid is this movie you ask?, well if the dragons whiped out our civilization by overcomming our missle, bomb, and nuke capabilities , then how  is it that a less potent projectile such as a harpoon or arrow is able to kill these things?. Thats where this movie misses its mark by not answering those questions but, vaguely describing that topic through a narration done by Christian Biel (lead character).  <BR>Another issue I had with this film was its little use of the special effects. We saw more self pitty drama of these english folks bickering with the americans conerning the logic to fight  the dragons rather then viewing the battle scenes involving a hoard of dragons using their extraordianary powers against our ground and air defenses as advertized on this films promotion billboards. Rather, the battle sequences were limited to fighting one dragon  at a time (two dragons total throughout the whole movie) although  in fairness, the battle scenese were done well. <BR>In conclusion I can't believe this movie made it into the Theatres and its a good thing I rented it on DVD as opposed to shelling out 10 bucks to waste my time. This movie looked more like a made for TV flick..
0452270073|5.0|This book deserved the praise it has received.  It is horrifying at times and incredibly clear-eyed about the situation the characters find themselves in.  The story is succint, crystal clear, and short, but the characters are breathtakingly, brilliantly drawn.  Barker has found amazing characters to work with, drawing liberally from real writers and doctors of the time.  This can be read as an outstanding historical novel, or literary novel, but it is just plain brilliant.
B00005QDW1|4.0|If you're thinkin you're gonna be getting something like Return To Saturn, sorry pal. It's still the girlish style Gwen likes, but it's more ska-ish and advanced pop-ish. Her words and voice sound like a little girl. Of course I love her voice though. Her words are catchy too. There's a song on here called &quot;Waiting Room&quot; that has a soft rock/big-lady-singer-style ring to it. Not at all No Doubt? Yes, I agree. There's about 2, maybe 3, songs I would say are ska, a couple i would say are pop. This whole cd is very floaty and innocent. It's still a cool CD, it's just really different from their other stuff.<br />1) &lt;INTRO&gt; A floaty taste of track 13.<BR>2) &lt;HELLA GOOD&gt; Advanced Pop, very cool though.<BR>3) &lt;HEY BABY&gt; Advanced Pop, great song if you haven't heard it 100 times already lol.<BR>4) &lt;MAKING OUT&gt; Very cool, Very catchy.<BR>5) &lt;UNDERNEATH IT ALL&gt; Great ska song.<BR>6) &lt;DETECTIVE&gt; Very catchy, very cool advanced pop.<BR>7) &lt;DONT LET ME DOWN&gt; Cute.<BR>8) &lt;START THE FIRE&gt; Like an indian tribe song, pretty cool.<BR>9) &lt;RUNNING&gt; Nice song with some emotion.<BR>10)&lt;IN MY HEAD&gt; Very very cool song, with more emotion.<BR>11)&lt;PLATINUM BLONDE LIFE&gt; Cute, little girl words and beat, but a nice song.<BR>12)&lt;WAITING ROOM&gt; A money-maker, but aright.<BR>13)&lt;ROCK STEADY&gt; They could've made this one a lot better.<br />If you're open-minded, I think you might like this one.

0064400557|5.0|This book isn't for 15 year old high school students. It's a good book, but it's really easy. It's a good book to choose if you need to read a book in a day. It is a good presentation book too.The characters are easy to relate to, and it has a good plot. The reading level is very low, which is why I think the book is so easy. It would be a good book for a 4th grader. The description level of the characters in the book is very low. The ending is a little weird, but  i guess it would seem a lot more interesting if I was 9 years old. The main character's name is Wilbur, and his best friend's name is Charlotte. She's a spider that befriends wilbur when he gets upset because the sheep told him he was going to be killed after he got fat enough. The bond between Charlotte and wilbur grows stronger, and stronger as the book goes along. The girls name who rescued Wilbur from being killed because he was a runt is Fern. Her brother's name is Avery. Their last name is Arable. Once Wilbur is old enough he has to be sold to a farmer down the road. His name is Mr. Zuckerman. There is a rat that runs a round the farm, who's name is Templeton. Fern visits Wilbur every day until school starts. As their lives go on, she stops coming as often and that's when Charlotte comes. Wilbur is lonely, and is very disturbed about him being killed and eaten. charlotte comes up with an elaborate plan to save Wilbur. Write messages in her web about Wilbur. she has to use \\"thread\\" that isn't sticky, because she doesn't want bugs to ruin the webs. Her plan ends up saving his life, but I won't tell you how the book ends, because I don't want to give it away.
B00005JLF5|5.0|I can't get enough Star Trek.  We have been able to get reruns of all of the Star Treks on TV except--Deep Space Nine.  I have not seen it since the last season ended.......  Did you know that Deep Space Nine is the link between Next Generation and Voyager??  Yes, besides Chief O'Brien, and later, Worf, being assigned to DS9, Enterprise visits DS9 in the first episode, and Voyager was at DS9 when they were called upon to follow a Maquis ship into the Badlands (when both ships ended up in the delta quadrant).......  I can't wait till it is out!!!  Christmas is coming a little late this year.
6304698542|5.0|It's often been said about old musical movies that they went too far in the conceit of people \\"bursting out in song\\" during a scene.  Well, in his film version of Kander & Ebb's masterful Cabaret, Bob Fosse completely got around that problem by presenting the songs on stage.  It was handled brilliantly, the choreography was incredible, and the movie just plain works.<br />Cabaret the movie doesn't share many songs in common with the original stage version - it still has \\"Willkommen,\\" \\"Two Ladies,\\" \\"Tomorrow Belongs To Me,\\" a German version of \\"Married,\\" \\"If You Could See Her,\\" and \\"Cabaret\\" - but that's it.  A few new songs were added - \\"Mein Herr,\\" \\"Maybe This Time,\\" \\"Money, Money,\\" - but for the most part it's a lot less sung than the staged version.  A lot of musical numbers dealing with the world outside the Kit Kat Klub were used as underscoring, preserving John Kander's great tunes.  But this doesn't detract from it being one of the best filmed musicals out there.<br />Fosse's direction is a big help; it has a great eye for early 1930s Berlin, and presents the decadence and foreshadows the Nazis brilliantly.  Fosse created great, sensual choreography for the film, and it is completely entrancing to watch the musical numbers.  And the rest is worth it, too.<br />Flipflops aside, the couples are presented well; Liza Minelli's portrayal of Sally Bowles is definitely the acting part of a lifetime.  She was just completely *convincing* as Sally, from end to end.  Michael York as Brian is very reserved, very British, and very studied.  Helmut Griem is entirely convincing as Max, who creates tension between the couple after befriending them.  The secondary couple is played to perfection by Fritz Wepper and Marisa Berenson, as opportunistic Fritz Wendel who falls in love with the rich young Jewess Natalia Landauer, respectively.  And, of course, Joel Grey is spectacular as the haunting, Puckish Emcee.<br />In general, this movie presents itself as a stunning revelation to viewers of a story that will stick around for a very long time.  It's a virtuoso interpretation of one of the greatest American musicals, and deserves to be seen.
6304539282|5.0|Following the tremendous success of the re-release of the 20th anniversary editions of &quot;Star Wars&quot;, &quot;The Empire Strikes Back&quot;, and &quot;Return of the Jedi&quot;, all three of these films have been put together into one box set.  Each movie contains extra footage that was not included in the original films, such as Han's encounter with Jabba the Hutt at Mos Eisley.  All of the action and adventure that we all have grown to love over the years is brought back to life, and the new scenes are excellent as well.  This set is a must for Star Wars fans. I still like this trilogy more than episodes 1 and 2. I think the story lines and characters are much better in this trilogy.  Buy this excellent set and relive the Star Wars saga over and over.
0385503954|4.0|Like a medieval triptych McEwan portrays a three-phased story, each one independent in its own and at the same time interlinked by the initial drama and the consequences thereafter.  On the first setting the year is 1935, an upper-middle-class family, with descriptive scenery and well elaborated characters.  The full responsibility for a misconstrued judgment by Briony (the young teenager) will bring dreadful effects on the lives of her sister (Ceci) and her loved one (Robbie).  The second panel describes with acute sensitivity and sometimes morbid overtones the retreat to Dunkirk, a crude historical reality over which the author did a considerable research.  On the last phase the setting is London during the war, concentrating on the efforts by the medical staff and assistants to cope with the wounded.  As an aftermath, the author brings the main character all the way to 1999, in a grand and clever finale.<BR>&quot;Atonement&quot; compounds fiction with historical facts, at the same time addressing the intricacies between the creator and his creation.  The writer by means of her imagination and fantasy is to be held fully responsible; she is playing the role of God and as such there is no atonement for whatever misconceptions she has made.  Briony is victim of her imagination as much as &quot;Don Quijote&quot; is overtaken by illusions, and although both are moved by a sense of justice, the later is an idealist while Briony has simply indulged in literary models.  Contrary to the Marabar Cave incident in &quot;Passage to India&quot; (Morgan Forster), there is no retraction and the accused is condemned.  An interesting issue to be raised is to what extent Robbie's proletarian status weights in the final verdict? And whilst Briony has to deal with her guilt throughout her lifetime, is the real perpetrator conscious free?<BR>&quot;Atonement&quot; has the merit of having a refined narrative, a vivid and well-documented historical setting, a subtle touch of drama, altogether contributing to an enjoyable reading.
B000003S0D|5.0|Both individual and innovative in their own rights, King Crimson's first two releases were not replicas of each other, but they were undeniably largely similar albums.  With Lizard however, King Crimson's sound exploded out of its mold stretching its far reaching tentacles in a million different directions at once and pulling in all that they could grab.  For critics who scolded Fripp for not advancing his band's sound more on their second album, Lizard was glorious proof of Crimson's immense diversity and creative abilities dabbling in everything from Beatles type pop to pure jazz.  Having suffered numerous lineup changes by the time of Lizard's conception however, all of Crimson's original members were gone other than a core lineup of Fripp, Collins, and Sinfield.  Therefore it was painfully obvious that the band would need to utilize the help of some friends in order to survive for another CD.  Thankfully, Fripp decided to employ the sometimes manic and sometimes delicate, but always impressive, Keith Tippet Band.  The enormous, intricate sound created by a full jazz ensemble complimenting the already gigantic, mellotron drenched riffs makes for one of the best fusions of jazz and rock ever attempted not only raising the bar for Prog rock artists like Yes and The Mahavishnu Orchestra but for Jazz artists like Miles Davis as well.  The insane detail and careful crafting of every note on the album is breathtaking and the new world that King Crimson has created can be appreciated on any number of countless levels.  Running through four traditional yet adequately unique and always enjoyable songs before even really warming up, the ability, intensity, and sheer love of music brought by all participating artists is a thing of beauty.  The second half of the CD though is where the true grandeur of the album lies, although the preceding four songs easily rank amongst Crimson's finest work.  Consisting of a single 20+ minute piece, Lizard is an extended suite that tells afantastical tale of medieval times where Prince Rupert fights for his kingdom against the evil Lizards.  While the subject matter could easily be dismissed as silly and pretentious, and in some senses it is, the scope of the music is so hugely immense, anything less exaggerated would seem purely anticlimactic.   So in the end, Lizard doesn't quite steer clear of all the pitfalls of Prog Rock, but it is a classic scenario of the ends justifying the means.  Regardless of what semi-overindulgent or occasionally ridiculous themes are coursing throughout the album, the music is of such a high caliber and the songs are arranged so perfectly, it is next to impossible to truly fault the group for lyrical content alone.  Yet another under-appreciated masterpiece by the Crimson King, Lizard is a stunning display of avid musicianship and stellar songwriting that ranks amongst the band's greatest achievements.
B000002J1O|4.0|Maybe I should be worried about this, but as I've &quot;grown up&quot; I've mostly abandoned the 3-chord wailing and banging of the rock I used to listen to and replaced it with something a little more subtle: something to listen to rather than something that makes me want to bash my head against my friends.<br />Though Genesis were relatively young when they recorded this album, the music is not typical for groups of guys in their 20s. It has a touch of classical music to it. It is complex; the parts don't simply mimic each other. The guitarist actually has a part, as well as the bassist and keyboards. Even the drums are layered and interesting to listen to in their own right (Phil Collins does have musical talent, it seems).<br />The songs are not mere verse-chorus-verse-chorus. They evolve from one melodic theme to another. &quot;Dancing With The Moonlit Knight&quot; (one of Genesis' best songs) begins a capella, slowly builds, creshendoes with the help of incredible mellotron (a very underrated instrument) and then settles down again into a hypnotic instrumental. There's no real chorus, no single catchy riff that repeats again and again and again and again and again and again... Most of the album is like this, apart from 2 songs: &quot;I Know What I Like&quot; and &quot;More Fool Me.&quot;<br />&quot;I Know What I Like&quot; actually charted in the U.K. (so I've read), even though the song begins with lawnmower sounds. It is a catchy number, but not inanely so.<br />&quot;More Fool Me&quot; is easily the weakest song on the album. It is sung by Phil Collins (NOT his vocal debut with Genesis). It's a little bit of an acoustic yawner, which is surprising considering the energy of the rest of the CD. It's not bad, it's just not great. In retrospect, it may also have been a sign of things to come...<br />The second half of the album is dominated by very long songs that have just as much instrumental work in them as singing. Progressive Rock (is that what it was called?) was not afraid to let instruments, and not just vocalists, have the spotlight for more than 30 seconds. It is musician's music that can be appreciated by non-musicians (though musicians will probably always be progressive rock's greatest fans).<br />This album is yet another great one in the Genesis catalog. It is the last of the &quot;traditional&quot; Genesis albums that traces back to &quot;Trespass&quot; (i.e., long, progressive rock songs with Peter Gabriel in front). The follow-up (&quot;The Lamb Lies Down On Broadway&quot;) is very different from anything the band did before or since. In a way that makes &quot;Selling England By The Pound&quot; a landmark album for the band. But don't listen to it for that reason: listen to the music.

0871137380|5.0|Wow!  Read this book in two sittings, flying to LAX and coming back home.  I just purchased a few other books that I want to read first, but you better believe BHD will be in the rotation again and again.<br />Surprisingly the movie captures a lot of the chaos and blunders, but still, as is usually the case, the book goes to the deepest corners.  An amazing read.  At first I was a little turned off by the &quot;term paper&quot; style writing.  I read Bowden's other book &quot;Killing Pablo&quot; before this (which is also a great read, btw, although not as good), so maybe reading them back to back was a little too much non fiction overload.  But by midway through, you feel like you're sitting in that Ops room watching the battle unfold yourself.  At times, I laughed out loud at some of the ironies.  Other times I wanted to cry.  Sometimes I just wanted to reach out and choke the burreaucracy.<br />You get the whole story here.  The ground level soldiers taking heavy fire, helicopter pilots trying to keep their orbit, families of the dead and wounded, the enemy's viewpoint, etc. etc.<br />Simply put, BUY IT.  It will get much use again and again.
630467578X|3.0|This overly predictable sci-fi/action yarn (based on a story by Stephen King which he wrote under the pen name Richard Bachman) stars good 'ol Arnie as a wrongfully accused man forced to fight for his life on a TV game show in the year 2017.  Former Family Feud game show host Richard Dawson is great as the slimy evil game show host, and the rest of the cast includes Maria Conchita Alonso (as a love interest who believes Arnie's innocence), the late Yapphet Kotto (as one of Arnie's pals), and Governor Jesse \\"The Body\\" Ventura.  The Running Man is action packed and is a solid, albeit cheesy, Arnie extravaganza, but if your looking for some of Arnold's better films your better off checking out Total Recall, Predator, or either Terminator film.
B00005JLS0|3.0|Here's a fairly cliched plot redeemed by some acerbic wit, Sandra Bullock's wonderful physical comedy, and Hugh Grant's nicely controlled performance as a wealthy nitwit construction mogul. The movie works because the two stars have good chemistry and play off each other well. The ending is a foregone conclusion, but it's entertaining to see how these two get there.<br />What's a little scary is to see that Alicia Witt, a talented young actress and gifted pianist (remember Cybil's sardonic, red-haired daughter on her last TV series?) has gone the route of too many Hollywood actresses and looks, in this movie, alarmingly thin. When you're so acutely aware of the bones in a performer's chest that you scarcely notice her performance, something's very wrong. <br />This is a pleasantly entertaining movie; nothing challenging. Some good laughs and good performances elevate this one to above average. Be sure to look out for Norah Jones (the terrific young jazz singer-pianist) doing a too-brief stint with a track (\\"The Nearness of You\\") from her new album Come Away With me.

Deer Dance~ Good, sorta wierd...<BR>4. Jet Pilot~ Really funky. It's great!<BR>5. X~ Interesting...<BR>6. Chop Suey!~ Good. Nice guitar riffs.<BR>7. Bounce~ I love this song! It's catchy and jumpy and just really funny! Pogo pogo pogo pogo pogo!<BR>8. Forest~ Good, gets better<BR>9. Atwa~ Pretty good. <BR>10. Science~ One of my favorites. I love the funky tunes in the middle of the song.<BR>11. Shimmy~ Wierd, yet strangely, very good.<BR>12. Toxicity~ Best song ever!<BR>13. Psycho~ Good, although the lyrics are a little strange.<BR>14. Aerials~ 2nd best song. The Indian-thing at the end is cool.
B00005RIKD|4.0|This shouldn't be dismissed just as another Sting album.  It's a document which expresses, especially at the beginning, our feelings at the time of the 9-11 tragedy.  Beyond that, it expresses the need for healing and adjustment.  I am surprised that there are no spoken words on the recording, but maybe this is for the best. <br />I have read some of the strong negative reviews and I hope these people keep this CD for listening in the future after they have lived more of their life.  I believe they will have a deeper understanding and appreciation for what Sting has done here at that time.<br />The opening number, &quot;Fragile&quot;, captures the mood of the day, and the progression in mood and jazz flavor throughout the album provides the healing.  Thus, this is an album which might be quite appropriate to listen to in times of sorrow, because it doesn't stay at the sorrowful level, but progresses to a level of healing, rebuilding, and of steadfast hope.  <br />Had the recording been postponed, we would have a different album.  It's my personal opinion that we have a more valuable recording because it was not postponed.
0792833236|3.0|This is not what I was looking for. It is filled with women and children crying, being beaten, and being sweared at. It is the story of the boxer Jake LaMotta. If this movie is true to his life, it was horrible. He screams at his wife and brother. He marries again, a 15-year-old girl. He constantly accuses her of cheating on him. We get to see him nearly beating his brother to death in front of his family. And his brother we get to see almost beating another man to death. This movie was full of misery. People say the meanest things and beat each other for the smallest reasons. The only part I liked was when LaMotta refuses to go down against Robinson. <br />I commend this movie's realism. It portrays misery accurately. The actors are very good. De Niro is great as LaMotta. If this movie is worth buying on dvd, it is because of his performance.

0060523794|3.0|This is a fairly good book by an immensely talented CEO. It takes up more or less a few decades after the retirement of one of the greatest businessmen of the 20C (TWatson Jr.), when the business had lost its way and was under attack by extremely nimble rivals.<br />Gerstner took over the failing, almost bankrupt, company and both re-made its startegy and culture, re-focusing it on customer needs and re-engineering it (i.e. laying off an awful lot of people). In this book, he tells the outlines of how he did it, which is indeed extremely interesting. In particular, he stresses that while a strategy is needed, implementation of it is far more important.<br />Unfortunately, he does not go into enough detail for the reader to fully understand what he faced and how he did it. Neither the technology nor the brutal methods he had to employ were adequately addressed, at least for me. I read it carefully and did not feel I had had quite the full meal I expected. The reader also gets virtually no insight into what makes Gerstner tick, other than that he \\"wants to win\\" with passion. THe book was also entirely written by Gerstner; his style is competent, if somewhat like a business memo: good analyses are \\"actionable\\" and effective actions are \\"impactful.\\"<br />Nonetheless, this is a very good primer on basic strategy and organizational behavior. He has lots of valuable advice to give and pinpoints many important issues. I will keep it and return to it.<br />THere were some things that I found questionable and surprising, if also unintentionally revealing. FOr example, he made IBM both an honest broker in offering comprehensive technology-based business solutions - for the first time, its employees could recommend the hardware of competitors if they better suited the customers' needs - while another part of the company continued to strive to produce the best hardware. This flatly contradicts both what Porter advises and Gerstner himself argues elsewhere in the book regarding the self-reinforcing compatibility of the elements of a business strategy and makes me question if Gerstner really thought it all thru. In addition, he astonishingly posits that Japanese business reporters are the best in the world, when in fact - and I worked in Japan for Nikkei, a leading business news wire service - they are merely part of the PR apparatus of firms, reporting verbatim what they were told to report by companies! If that is what Gerstner expected of Western reporters, then he was naive. But then, he was a benevolent dictator and is open about his dislike and lack of trust of the press.<br />REcommended. But if you really want a rivetting account of IBM, I would recommend Watson's autobio, Father Son & Co. There is also an excellent account of the turnaround of Xerox, using TQM, that is far more compelling a read than this book.he self-reinforcing compatibility of the elements of a business strategy and makes me question if Gerstner really thought it all thru.

6305280762|3.0|Based on the books `The Tower\\" (by Richard Martin Stern) and \\"The Glass Inferno\\" (by Thomas N. Scortia & Frank M. Robinson), this suspense movie about a raging fire in a San Francisco skyscraper is regarded by many as a classic disaster film.  The owner's son-in-law has taken a few shortcuts with the building code, and the building bursts into flames just as a party of VIPs celebrates a gala opening of the building on the top floor.  We see the interplay of characters that ensues: the owner and the architect engaged in histrionics, and the fire chief and crew engaged in heroics.  Interwoven are layers of individual stories of personal tragedy and triumph.  And there's a fair share of extra-marital affairs going on too, although some of the adulterers pay the consequences for their trysts by going up in smoke, and the heat is provided by the fire not by steamy nude scenes. As you would expect from an older movie, there's lots of 70s d&eacute;cor and hair, and the men are depicted as heroes out to rescue hapless and helpless women.  The star-studded cast included Steve McQueen, Paul Newman, Fred Astaire, William Holden and even O.J. Simpson.<br />In the end, it's not an outstanding effort for a suspense movie, although it did win Academy awards for Best Song, Editing & Cinematography.  There are lots of special effects with fire, but some become tiresome as they are repeated again and again.  And the way in which the fire was put out in the end was ridiculously unbelievable.  But meanwhile, you do get a small sense of what it's like to fight a fire, with John Williams' accompanying music evoking good suspense.  There are some memorable lines about fires: \\"Is it bad?  It's a fire, all fires are bad.\\" \\"It's your building, but it's our fire.\\"  There have been better disaster movies, but also far worse ones.  If nothing else this movie serves as good argument for construction workers to stick to building standards and code. It may not be deep, but it's still pretty good fun.un.
B00000I3JO|5.0|I remember when I first got the chance to listen to this album, it was through a promo in Interview magazine. By mailing a postage paid card to EMI records you were able to get a free copy of the Blue Niles' &quot;Hats&quot; album. This is where my journey began...Paul Bucannans' voice oozed solemnity and heartfelt loneliness that took you past train stations, under gaslights and through neon lit streets. The trumpet created a soundtrack that sounded like an old noir movie, I only wish Chris Botti had been able to play on this like Bucannan was able to do on Bottis'&quot;Midnight Without You&quot;. I was also elated when the gifted composer Craig Armstrong took the already lovely &quot;Let's Go Out Tonight&quot; and transformed it into heavenly orchestral audio bliss...YOU NEED THIS ALBUM. This music is a blessing,it soars it,it soothes and simmers with emotion. From the first note of &quot;Over the Hillside&quot;, that contemplates the concerns of the working class, balancing love and labor to the final strings of &quot;Saturday Night&quot;, that confirmes the priority of loving someone for who they are for the sheer reason of the way they bring out the best in you. If you love mood music and music that takes you places.....by &quot;Hats&quot;.
B00003CXRP|5.0|Don't make the mistake of thinking this is a modern day Robinson Crusoe.  It's far from it!  Survival is only a small part of the story of Chuck Noland, who ends up on a deserted island in the Pacific after a plane crash.  There's a great deal of things that make this movie a success.  Notably, there are lots of special effects and some very clever filming and computer work.  As a result, you really feel as if you are on the spot - on the plane as it goes down, on the raft as it bobs in the waves, on the island alone.  It's the realism that's led to the PG-13 rating, and not offensive content.  Admittedly there are a few items of content that are morally questionable, such as a few incidents of blasphemy, a crude sexual joke, and the contemplation of suicide.  Initially Chuck and Kelly live together while unmarried, and though-out his stay on the island there's a real absence of religious faith as fatalism replaces providence (while burying a crash victim, Chuck concludes an \\"empty\\" ceremony with the words \\"So.  That's it.\\")  But on the whole this movie is morally inoffensive, and its PG-13 rating is mainly due to frightening scenes, such as the airplane crash and later a floating dead body, and several injuries including the scraping of skin on coral, a splinter in his hand, and the removal of a tooth.  But even these scenes are more frightening because of the emotional sense of pain than graphic images.  Clever manipulation of sights and sounds are used to create a real sense of fear and suspense, and even the simple dropping of coconuts on the sand becomes frightening. Hitchcock would have been proud.<br />But even more than the special effects, it is especially the emotional conclusion combined with some stellar acting that made this movie. The survival story is framed by the story of Chuck's life in America.  As a result, the movie is like a play with three Acts.  Act 1 introduces us to Chuck Noland (Tom Hanks), a FedEx systems engineer whose professional life is ruled by the clock.  \\"We live and we die by time.  Let us not commit the sin of turning our back on time.\\"  His personal life, including his relationship with girlfriend Kelly Frears (Helen Hunt) is dominated by time, and it is exactly for this reason that Chuck ends up on the doomed plane which crashes into the Pacific in a storm.<br />Acts 2 shows Chuck cast away on the island.  The clock, as it were, has stopped.  His survival experiences were based on the research and actual experiences of the screenwriter, and are depicted with a great deal of realism (Hanks made his contribution by losing a lot of weight and growing a delightful beard).  The island is no utopian tropical paradise, and consequently Chuck doesn't succeed with everything right away.  As he seeks to obtain the basic elements needed for human survival - food, water, shelter, fire, and companionship - there are memorable moments of triumph and tragedy, including his frustrations in getting coconut milk, his exuberance in starting a fire, and his primitive dentistry skills.  There is little dialogue, but a few floating FedEx packages supply him with \\"Wilson\\" the volleyball, who becomes his companion.  It's somewhat corny, but Wilson becomes a device for Chuck to express his thoughts and hold imaginary conversations.  Time has stopped on the timepiece Kelly gave him, but it is her photo on the clock that inspires Chuck to stay alive.<br />Act 3 brings Chuck back to civilization after some five years of survival on the island.  His Rip Van Winkel type return from the dead in my mind is the highlight of the movie, and results in emotional and moral dilemmas of tremendous power.  As his colleague says: \\"Tomorrow we're going to bring you back to life.\\"  But coming back to life isn't so easy when you return to a world after five years where time hasn't stopped.  If surviving as a castaway on an island was difficult, Chuck discovers that it's just as difficult to be alive in the changed world to which hehas returned.  Back at home, he's still a castaway.  Just as on the island, where \\"I stayed alive.  I kept breathing\\", so now he must keep breathing, waiting to see what the tide will bring.  A magnificent story-line combined with some tremendous acting from both Hanks and Hunt results in a powerful sense of loss.  I was grateful that the story didn't degenerate into a feel-good type ending with an immoral tryst, but actually suggested faithfulness to the institution of marriage (a departure from Chuck and Kelly's initial live-in relationship).  The ending is tough, but realistic, emotional, and powerful, and I was left thinking about it for a long long time.  There is a note of hope in the end, but it is not shoved down your throat, with Chuck left at the cross-roads of decision: \\"Where are you headed?  Well, I was just about to figure that out.\\"  If there is a criticism, it would perhaps be that we don't get to spend as much time with the changed Chuck in Act 3 as we would like -  he has a new perspective on life, and we would learn something if we saw this new perspective put into practice.  But for viewers whose lives are also governed by the clock, what we do see is already enough to motivate us to spend our few years on earth under the clock wisely.has returned.

0425152251|5.0|You can always find huge books about philosophy and after a few pages you're totally lost, and have to start over again several times. But this one is different. Jostein Gaarder has sold this book all over the world, and I can see why!!<BR>I first started to read this book when I was 15 years old, and to be honest I found it boring and gave up after a few chapters. But having read it again now, 4 years later, I have a completely different view on the book. It's not hard to read and you can easily follow young Sophie's ways of thinking. To some point her ways of thinking can be reflected in your ways of thinking. Trying to understand who you are, where you're from and other ancient philosophical questions. Seeing the different aspects of thinking makes you start to think yourself.<br />I would recommend this to anyone older than 18. And espesially to those you want to learn something about philosophy without starting on books with a difficult language and content. And most important, all history of philosophy gathered in one place, to give you an easy overview on it. I had read this book before studying a semester of Philosophy, and it made the studies a lot easier! It's really worth to read, and you won't be disappointed.
B00005U122|4.0|After seeing this tour live in Darien Lake, New York I had to see if the DVD captured the magic of this extraordinary concert. It does. Roger Waters and his ensemble stunned witnesses to his \\"In The Flesh\\" concert tour across America and this DVD enhances that experience with revealing camera work of the performers and considerable attention to the super-wide Waters-like images that backed the stage. At the center of the stage Waters looked humble, as if unaware of the devotion and and gratitude the fans offer him, acknowledging them with a shy but commanding stage presence as if he was doing nothing more than offering them a beer. He and his ensemble became a dynamic collective force blasting out a unity heralding Water's solo career with each member becoming an integral component to the astounding musical package. Andy Fairweather Low's blazing guitar solo during \\"Money\\", Jon Carin's letter perfect vocal rendition on \\"Dogs\\", Doyle Bramhall II's constant virtuosity in interpreting Pink Floyd and David Gilmour's lead guitar work; all these performances and the rest of the musical cast brilliantly recreated Water's and Pink Floyd's music. I was reminded while watching this how much alt-music fans have to be thankful for in Roger Waters. His is a humane and intelligent delving into the psyche, questioning where we came from and fearing where we might go but always with a respect for the weakest human condition. He has remained consistent, alternative, stimulating, and challenging at a time when most contemporaries will abandon their past for the lure of a hit record. At the outdoor venue where I saw this show live, to the dismay of thousands of concert-goers, dark rain clouds threatened the sky just prior to the scheduled time, and as if on cue, to the cheers of the crowd a sudden rainbow dissipated the grey clouds like a Pink Floyd album cover just before Waters made his entrance. It was like God himself was the set designer. Yes, this DVD captures the magic of that blessed evening. Far out man.blessed evening. Far out man.

Any artist worth his salt would cringe at such adulation. After releasing the worst album of his often illustrious career, one only hopes His Highness can still cringe.<br />If one bothers to look through the few reviews that wrote critically on Mule Variations, they all coincide on the same points: Waits is recycling the same ol' textures, ideas, sounds, arrangements and, to top it all off, his songwriting is downright soporific. It's shamelessly parodic -- and no one seems to mind, including Tom! Those who've had the pleasure of being awed by Waits' output prior to this fiasco would wish he had never released it: It seems to signal a nearly irreversible downward road in Waits' creativity.<br />Just as frightening as the quality of the album is the mindless bandwagon mentality evident in the majority of the reviews for Mule Variations. Not only are these 'fans' falling over each other to elevate mediocrity to the status of genius, the album even won a Grammy! Typical. Wait till an artist produces his most drab conventional work ,and the music industry will reward him for it: Conformity, rather than innovation, is far easier to explain, understand, and consume. Sheep for the Mule.<br />With such unbridled eagerness to act and think alike as most of the reviewers below display, cloning is bound to become redundant before it even takes off.

Live sets often are a gamble sound quality wise, but I was pleasantly surprised (estactic is the right word) with \\"Alison Krauss + Union Station Live.\\" Alison shines on both vocals and fiddle, examples of the former on songs such as \\"Baby, Now That I've Found You,\\" and the latter on the rolicking, crowd-pleasing instrumental \\"Cluck Old Hen.\\" Jerry Douglas's dobro is a strongpoint of both the band and this performance. Dan Tyminski takes over lead vocals  on another of many highlights of this set, \\"The Boy Who Wouldn't Hoe Corn,\\" with a long dobro lead-in by Jerry. And, of course, the real crowd pleaser on this set is Tyminski (lead vocals), Jerry, Ron Block and Barry Bales reprising their work on the \\"Oh Brother, Where Art Thou\\" soundtrack foundation, \\"I am a Man of Constant Sorrow.\\" For me, another gem on this set carried over from the \\"Oh Brother\\" soundtrack is Alison, Dan, Ron and Barry soaring rendition of \\"Down to the River to Pray.\\" This incredible CD -- a great value -- continues to see heavy rotation in my CD players.

B000000I3O|5.0|This CD Has it all.20 of the greatest punk songs of all time.Each song is a true classic.In my opinion \\"Horror Business\\",\\"Astro Zombies\\",\\"Die Die My Darling\\",\\"Green Hell\\",\\"She\\",\\"Where Eagles Dare\\" are the greatest songs to ever be created by the band and they are all on this CD.This is just such a great CD and if you dont have it then i suggest you buy it.
B00005JL78|5.0|What do you get when you team one of the world's most bankable actors with the greatest director alive today? In the case of Tom Cruise and Steven Spielberg, the result is \\"Minority Report\\", a thrilling and intriguing crime drama which will most certainly become a sci-fi classic.     The year is 2054, and Washington, D.C. has been murder-free for six years, thanks to the implementaion of Pre-Crime, in which gifted psychics (or Pre-Cogs) are used to predict murders before they occur. The Pre-Crime police force, led by Chief John Anderton(Cruise), are able to arrest and \\"halo\\" the accused before the crime is committed. Anderton believes fully in the pre-crime system, despite the skepticism shown by federal agent Danny Witwer(Colin Farrell), who has been assigned to find flaws in pre-crime. It doesn't take long for Anderton himself to be predicted of committing a murder, which leads him to believe that Witwer set him up in order to make pre-crime fail. Nonetheless, Anderton must go on the run to prove his innocence....or is he unknowingly on the path to murder?     This was undoubtedly the best film I saw in 2002(and I saw quite a few). It's a huge rebound for Cruise, who was last seen in 2001's dismal \\"Vanilla Sky\\". I never particularly cared for most of his other performances, but he is remarkably good in this film. Oscar-worthy? Quite possibly. And Spielberg demonstates why he is the greatest director of the last 30 years. Yes, he's had some misses(\\"1941\\", \\"Always\\", \\"A.I.:Artificial Intelligence\\"), but as with all hs great films, he can thrill you one moment, elicit a laugh the next, even scare the pants off you, but his best films are the ones you talk about afterwards. No, \\"Minority Report\\" is not the most interesting title of a film, but it does figure into the plot. What's most surprising is the film's rating-somehow, it received a PG-13, when it should have been rated R for violence, suggested drug use, language and adult subject matter. However, it does not change my rating, as the film is a marvelous blend of special effects, top-notch acting and a fascinating story, which is hard to come by in a lot of films these days. See it!
1587990717|4.0|Fooled by Randomness should be considered an abstract to a much bigger and more detailed body of knowledge. For me it has served as both a guide to future study and as a way of coming to know and explain the concept of randomness. Another reviewer commented on the power of this book as a meme and I believe he was correct. To put it another way, the book gives people common ground to discuss the concept of randomness.<br />There has been some criticism leveled at this book by other reviewers. I believe it is a bit missplaced. It would be like critisizing the practice of giving introductory lessons to new piano players*, people need to start somewhere. What makes this book different than other introductions is not the depth in which the topics are covered, for almost no topic is discussed in detail. The difference is that this book brings to light material which is often ignored by even sophisticated practitioners.<br />A full third of the book is essentially autobiographical. Many people have no inclination toward such books and if you are one of them you could find this book annoying. My belief is that life is led by people and learning about them can enhance one's knowledge of how markets (as well as other things) work. Another reviewer called this noise. Is recalling the day one learned that one had cancer noise? In any context?<br />Four and one half stars.<br />*Perhaps a better analogy would be that of giving introductory lessons to a piano player learning a new style of playing.
B000002J1B|3.0|I love Yes. I love Spinal Tap. But I love them differently. I think that Spinal Tap's Jazz Odyssey is based on this album. That is not necessarily a good thing. But I do find this album fascinating in an over-the-top, train-wreck, Showgirls-esque so-bad-it's-hypnotic sort of way. Not the place to start if you only know Owner of a Lonely Heart.
B00005YW4H|4.0|I must say I was disappointed with the fact that the first 2 reviews on the page for this album were so negative. I found this album to be charming and relaxing. I agree with one of the negative reviewers that it is hypnotising at times but I think that is only because she has such a lovely soft and dusky voice that is almost like a soothing instrument. I found this album to be very pleasant and quite good for her first. I wouldn't put her abilities to be popular or a good artist down to her father's influence as she has clearly taken all her influences from her mother. I dount her father had much to do with her success. I find it disappointing though that some of her own lyrics are not more challenging but see potential for improvement there in the future. I was very glad to have bought the CD. I find it helps to relax me after a hard day at work while listening to it in the bath with some nice candles around or just having on to help relax me while reading a book. I recommend this to anyone who appreciates the difficulties in breaking into such an adult market. She appeals to younger jazz/bluesey fans that are coming into this genre and I only hope that she helps to bring more younger music fans into this niche.
B000009O8A|2.0|Also known as: Day of the Woman (1978).<br />The DVD print is in excellent form.  A big improvement from the old, scrathy, choppy prints we have seen on VHS fifteen years ago.  This low-budget film  has a cult following.  There is male  frontal nudity and female frontal nudity.  The sex scenes are ridiculously simulated.  A woman gets ultimatly raped by four men. They think they have left her for dead, however, she is very much alive and seeks out each man for revenge.  For adults only!

6305428220|5.0|During a time when the cinematic bowels of horror ruptured and teen movies seemed to flood the market and become a dime a dozen, I opted to skip this film because of some very bad experiences that still didn't set very well with me. Like many of the people I knew, there were lingering doubts plaguing me as to whether a mainstreamed cast of this nature could actually approach the terrible in a convincing way and if a theme that echoed \\"aliens kidnapped my baby while at high school\\" could actually find a way to be new and diverse. After a time, however, I opted to buy it on an impulse, liking something I had seen about the making of the beast that all the trouble stems from in this tale. After countless rewatches, I have to say that this isn't what I first stereotyped it to be and, although it isn't original, is very appealing.<br />We begin in the confines of our little Ohio-based school system, introduced to the living representations of all our modern stereotypes of what students can be. From there we see the basic interactions and the bullying - the drug-use and subsequent salesmanship, and the athletics - as our gaze is focused through one \\"geek\\" (Elijah Woods). Thinking his life is difficult enough already, he finds himself shocked when, looking around on the football field, he discovers the dehydrated remains of what appears to be a new species. Odder still, is its ability to come to life when introduced to water. This leads down even more bizarre pathways for him, and he finds himself and this band of miscreants we spent time watching early becoming stars when thrust into the gears of what seems to be an alien invasion.<br />While the script was nothing new, the actors more made up for this by providing seamless performances that were sometimes dry and sometimes surprisingly funny. On top of this, the effects on this were, in a word, delightful, giving the watcher something to keep an eye out for. From the beast with rows of teeth that would make any dentist smile and sing songs of happiness to the aquarium-based lifeforms, the DVD version of this had a quality that was simply superb. Add all of this together and you get one thing; a movie that is enjoyably delectable.mile and sing songs of happiness to the aquarium-based lifeforms, the DVD version of this had a quality that was simply superb.

0316666343|2.0|Reading the back of the book The Lovely Bones sounds like an enchanting story, but open in it and its brutal. The descriptions of Susie murder are much too graphic and highly disturbing. If you are sensitive about things like this think twice before reading it and don't get lured into the praise on the back of the book which makes you want to read it.
B00006CXXU|5.0|I found myself in a High end Beauty Spa/Salon and they were playing this CD the song that was on was #5 \\"Infatuation\\" (Latino flavor)I LOVED IT, in fact I loved it so much I immediately left the Salon and purchased the CD within a hour after hearing the song!!<br />I thought to give it to my 12 year old and my intention was to listen to it first before giving it to her. Well I liked this CD so much that it is now in my collection. Ms. Aguilera doesn't hold back anything in this CD and (IMO) silences once and for all the comparisons of the Britney Spears, Jessica Simpsons and the Mandy Moore. Her vocal quality and range is leaps and bounds over these youngsters that share the same time span in which they came out. She has a very soulful voice the kind that reaches in and makes you FEEL.<br />I must mention that I was brought up in a very heavy performance environment from Stage Performances to Recording Studios. Courtesy of my immediate family. So when I say this gal knocked my socks off..... I mean IT! Everyone has their own \\"ear\\" for music but I must mention my favorites are; Tracks #1 - #11 hehehehehe I especially enjoyed working out to this CD, she has a nice variety. Had enough up tempos for my Cardio work out and enough Slow songs for my Cool Down. The 2 songs that stick out in my mind are of course #5 \\"Infatuation\\" and also the song she did with Alicia Keyes #9 \\"Impossible\\" which for a moment I thought it was Whitney Houston singing...... in fact I had to check the CD and make sure that Whitney wasn't doing some collaborating on the DL (Down Low) This is a no-brainer for those of us who enjoy artists that can really........what we call in my part of town \\"blow\\".<br />Respectfully Reviewed
080726203X|5.0|What an interesting story! We need this now. I think anyone from the age of ten and up would benefit from reading it or hearing it read by the wonderfully expressive, Ron Rifkin. This is a cautionary tale about a society in which political correctness has been taken to an extreme. With just a few twists to the kind of yuppie-liberal, correct way, of behaving and thinking that seems to prevail at least in America now, the community of The Giver could be our own. Younger readers could find more meaning in this story of a utopia gone bad, if they can discuss the book with other youngsters and adults who have read it also.
B000002MY3|5.0|Alanis Morissette came to us in the 80s with cheerful, poppy tunes like Never Too Hot.  Fast forward to 1995 when the juggernaut album, Jagged Little Pill takes heed to society and plays all over.  Alanis' prolific album of angst towards ex-lovers, family and self-obsession are just some of the areas she explores on this record.  She emerged into an angsty, nail-biting, hair-flinging autobiographical singer with an incredible voice and vocal range.  <BR>Songs off of this album include the #1 hits Ironic, You Oughta Know (based on ex-boyfriend Dave Coulieu; Joey Gladstone from Full House) and Hand in My Pocket.  Each song breeds off of one another into the inner depths of her mind, exploring all that she is thinking.  Mary Jane speaks the truths of her childhood she kept hidden from her family for so many years.  About a young boy and girl who never meet their parents approval to any approximation.  The song that really struck me the most is one of the hidden tracks, Forgive Me.  It is an acapella piece showing the abomible strength of her vocals.  <BR>This album has gone down in history as one of the best albums of all time.  Her songs are endless and speak for those who heard it seven years ago or hearing it now for the first time.  Although her upcoming records will have a lot to live up to, Morissette has produced an incredible CD.  We Canadians should be proud!!!
B000069HK2|1.0|I saw the Used live in Utah just after they had signed their record deal and I have to state for the record that I was not impressed. Maybe these guys appeal to someone, but I am not that person. I think of myself as a pretty open minded individual when it comes to music (I listen to a WIDE spectrum of stuff, from KORN to country), but these guys are painful to listen to. I think that someone needs to give the lead singer a hug and some throat lozenges. Heaven knows he's going to need them after screaming like he does. The only thing I can find to appreciate about them is that they know how to play their instruments well enough to be recognized by a record company. Beyond that, I have no &quot;use&quot; for them. To all of you who enjoy the record, more power to you. Maybe they sound better on disc than they do live.
B00000DGUG|5.0|When people think of Alanis Morissette they think Hand in my Pock, or maybe it is Ironic.  Either way, Supposed Former Infatuation Junkie is not either of these.  Morissette did something practically unthinkable for any artist; she completely reinvented herself.  Not in her style but, again, in her musicality style.  Taking a five year hiatus from her rise to stardom over night with Jagged Little Pill, a trip to India rejuvinated Alanis in using more than drums and guitar.  Traditional instruments from India are mixed within the usual western world instruments to have a completely different flavour than what we are use to hearing.<BR>We start off with Baba and Front Row; songs almost like an epiphany.  They speak of her solitude in her life and like JLP, speak what she is thinking.  My favourite song on the album is Can't Not.  The wicked laugh got me right away but the riffs are amazing and have a great head-thrashing beat that cannot be dismissed.  I was Hoping is a ballad of sorts with the newly introduced eastern music.  A treat for every ear of the world.<BR>Supposed Former Infatuation Junkie cannot be compared to Jagged Little Pill.  JLP spoke of the angst she had toward men, life and the industry; SFIJ is almost like Alanis has reached a level of intimacy and solitude in her life.  She has accepted the terms and life style in which has (had to) embraced.  And of course, the singles cannot be cast away: Unsent, Thank U and So Pure (her first video directoral debut) were amazing songs that did herself justice but, not so much the album.  These songs did give the general public a 'real' listen to what was to come.<BR>Supposed Former Infatuation Junkie is different but sticks to true Alanis style.  The die hard fans will love it, the fans who love the singles will probably be looking for me Jagged Little Pill.  Pity reall for those persons, because this album is a work of art with true heart and soul.
0553573403|4.0|In \\"A Game of Thrones,\\" Martin eschews most of the bland trappings of genre fantasy plot style and writing to create a more realistic, more challenging, and simply better novel than any other contemporary fantasy since Feist's \\"Magician.\\"<br />The old adage about a polytheistic religion, like the gods of ancient Greek mythology, is that you don't need a 'devil' doing 'evil' because the various gods and goddesses will do enough despicable things to each other to make up for it.  Martin's array of very round and very real characters is similar, as they fight enough with each other that \\"A Game of Thrones\\" has no need of the standard fantasy clich&eacute; of an 'evil' arch enemy, whose minions must be thwarted by our heroes at every turn.  In addition, Martin has no true 'heroes,' just round characters with intricate motivations, each one containing some good and some evil, although some act more noble and others more vicious.  This more 'real' style of plot and the thorough characterization of complex characters give Martin's work an authentic feel that no other contemporary fantasy author has matched.<br />Martin's quasi-medieval kingdom includes many common fantasy genre trappings, but he so thoroughly makes them his own that even his chivalric machinations and jousting tournament feel most uncommonly vivid.  Despite the intimidating length of the book, Martin keeps the action and the characterization moving with concise chapters, each from only one character's point of view.  Martin wields this Faulkner-esque narrative technique with skill, showing different sides of specific events, but without having the narrative overlap and repeat the same scenes.<br />The epic scope of \\"A Game of Thrones\\" stretches quite far, although the book reads much faster than the length might suggest.  Some tangential although well crafted plot lines, such as Daenerys, could be eliminated entirely without harming the novel.  The character lists in the back of the book are imperative to keep track of the huge array of names, but Martin still draws each one of these characters, down to the most minor henchman, in colorful and unique detail.<br />Although the length is challenging, Martin's skill in creating a uniquely real fantasy world and plot and the changing point of view narrative make \\"A Game of Thrones\\" a brilliant read for the serious reader looking for more than just pale swords and sorcery imitations from their fantasy.track of the huge array of names, but Martin still draws each one of these characters, down to the most minor henchman, in colorful and unique detail.<br />Although the length is challenging, Martin's skill in creating a uniquely real fantasy world and plot and the changing point of view narrative make \\"A Game of Thrones\\" a brilliant read for the serious reader looking for more than just pale swords and sorcery imitations from their fantasy.
B0000797IO|4.0|&quot;The Good Girl&quot; is one of those movies that comes around that is not for everybody, but for some people this movie will be a well written, well acted film that will find their way into their hearts time after time. The film is very much like most &quot;Catcher in the Rye&quot; type stories. But with a special touch that gives that something more. The film is contains the best performance Jennifer Aniston has ever given. Jake Gyllenhaal is also very good as the put-upon young man. The only detriments to this DVD version is that the video transfer is terrible. Where there should be black shadow you get blue noise, and it can really get annoying. The disc also does not contain the trailer for the film which I enjoyed. Overall the film is quite wonderful, but this disc could have been way better.
B00006JJ1O|5.0|I purchased this album after hearing the group's single \\"All The Things She Said\\" on the radio. After giving the album a listen, I didn't really care much for it. But after listening to it over again, I began to notice the duo's amazing high voices that are instruments all in theirself. Then I noticed the innovative producing that really makes this album great. The producers use a range of instruments including drums, electric guitars, pianos, violins, and even an instrument that plays Eastern-like music. The thing that makes this duo different from other pop acts though is their lyrics. No, they don't write their own songs, but their lyrics are so well written and contain so much true meaning that they can really relate to, as well as any teenager.<br />The songs that I LOVE the most on this album are \\"Show Me Love\\", \\"How Soon Is Now\\", and most of all, \\"Stars\\". \\"Show Me Love\\" is a love song with a really awesome beat. \\"How Soon Is Now\\" really shows the duos AMAZING high voices, which they use SO beautifully. This song also has great lyrics and use of instruments. And then \\"Stars\\", my favorite, is (I think) a love song. In \\"Stars\\", there is use of this Eastern-sounding instrument that is really romantic and sensual. They also rap (very well) quite a bit in this song.<br />Their songs aren't the typical VERSE 1, CHORUS, VERSE 2, CHORUS, REPEAT CHORUS. T.A.T.U's style is very original and their sound is all their own. Their producers take a different approach to turning lyrics into a song and it's very unique. The melodies are very beautiful and stick with you. This album is one of the best I've heard EVER, and I strongly recommend it. You might not like it at first, but you will eventually love it.
B00005JKGO|5.0|The is a movie of stunning images that taken together provide a stunning and ironical montage of \\"the good life.\\" In fact, by the end I was reminded simultaneously of Thoreau's statement that the mass of people live lives of quiet desperation and Kierkegaard's belief that the natural condition of human beings is that of despair. There is no plot. The movie consists of a series of loosely or unconnected scenes with little or not attempt to link them. Many of the scenes are stunning. Some are disturbing. None of them are boring, which is remarkable given the length of the film (166 minutes).<br />The beginning is memorable, with a helicopter flying over Rome with a statue of Christ hanging underneath. A celebrity journalist, portrayed brilliantly by Marcello Mastroianni (the original producer, Dino de Laurentiis, pulled out of the project when Fellini refused to cast Paul Newman in the lead role), is following the statue in order to write about it, but he and his team get distracted by women sunbathing in bikinis on a rooftop. In this and many other scenes, the tremendous gap between traditional and historical symbols of meaning and current preoccupation with mere pleasure is articulated. The overwhelming sense in the film is of the tremendous triviality of these people's lives and the loss of moral purpose. There are only two exceptions in the film: Marcello's close friend Steiner, whose life is a search for meaning and truth, and a young girl Marcello first meets at a restaurant where she is a food server and then sees again in the last few moments of the film. But Steiner's search is a futile one, leading him not merely to kill himself but his two children as well. And the young girl is not merely a symbol of innocence, but of innocence lost, not to be found again. In the last few seconds of the film, after a drunken debauch, Marcello walks to the seashore at dawn. There he sees the young girl across a watery divide. She waves to him, and tries to shout something to him. But her words are drowned by the waves and the wind, and eventually they both smile, realizing that they he will never be able to hear what she has to say. The way that Marcello wistfully shrugs his shoulders is almost an acknowledgement that he is one of the damned. It is one of the most heartbreaking moments in modern film, as well as one of the most poignant.<br />Rome itself is as prominent in this film as any of the characters, but it is not the Rome one finds in ROMAN HOLIDAY. Much of the city looks not historic or beautiful, but antiseptic, shoddily fabricated, barely reclaimed modern ruins. There are a number of ugly modernistic buildings and a number of the areas look bleak and abandoned. This is all, of course, highly symbolic of the bleakness of the lives of the characters. Many films have discussions like this imposed on them (I think of some of the magnificent parodies in episodes of Monty Python), but LA DOLCE VITA almost demands metaphysical discussion.

It is not epic or histrionic, but playful and light, almost ironic, as if to underscore the manner in which the characters whistle while Rome burns itself out.<br />A spectacular film, one of my favorites ever.

B00006L7XQ|4.0|And I mean that in the best possible way.  And Lord knows I don't want it to happen for another 30 years or so; let there be many more CDs from The Man.  But this feels mighty like a valedictory, looking backward, but mostly forward to the end and after.  His voice is a wreck, of course, but that only adds to the power of the often gloomy and pain-filled songs here.  Do not expect to find peaceful rest, either in the crossing or in the beyond, through these lyrics or the way Cash sings them.  And yet, yet, here and even in darkness there is also hope, tenderness and optimism.<br />The Man Comes Around sets the tone immediately.  The only newly written song in the set, it includes a spoken intro and coda vision of the Four Horses of the Apocalypse, arresting lyrics (\\"they'll be a golden ladder coming down...\\" \\"the whirlwind is in the thorn tree...\\"), as well as one truly insipid one (\\"the father hen will call his chickens home...\\"), and is simply unforgettable as a vision of Judgement Day.  Trent Reznor's Hurt follows, the superb latest example of Cash's constant and wide-ranging musical curiosity.  A 70 year old singing Nine Inch Nails? Come on!  But Cash makes the song his own, just as he did on American 3: Solitary Man with the obscure but stunning I See A Darkness. Next up is the first of two old Cash classics, Give My Love to Rose.  The other is Tear Stained Letter and both, while first recorded by a much younger Cash, now also fit the album's mood of endings (and also, nicely, the title, The Man Comes Around again to his classics).  He does a wonderful version of Bridge Over Troubled Water.  And who would have ever expected a song like I Hung My Head from the great egoist Sting?  It sounds like a five minute Cormac McCarthy novel, bizarre and driven by fate.  <br />Among the remaining nine songs you will find a tenderly song Danny Boy, a definitive version of the dying cowboy's fate in Streets of Laredo, Nick Cave sharing vocals on I'm So Lonesome I Could Cry,and an unironic (unlike the Dr. Strangelove version) We'll Meet Again. <br />So with all this, why be churlish and give only four stars instead of five (just the whole idea of giving stars to Johnny Cash smacks of ultimate hubris, but that's the system here)?  Well, I found the vocals on The First Time Ever I Saw Your Face and In My Life pretty uninspired.  Cash doesn't take over the songs and when they have been recorded as often as they have, I think any new version really has to do that.  Finally, Desperado, Personal Jesus and Sam Hall are minor works compared to everything else here.  These are nitpicks -- four stars or five, doesn't matter.  It's Johnny; it's late in his life and we need everything he puts out, simple as that.
B00003CXFG|1.0|This had all the makings of an interesting project, but ultimately it falls between two stools. Is it an art project, or is it a Hollywood blockbuster?<br />The premise is simple; put Vin Diesel and some other actors in a windowless room, turn out the lights and then film the action. With only your hearing to guide you, two hours of mayhem ensue as Diesel kicks off in a big way when Rahda Mitchell states that \\"The Fast and the Furious\\" was rubbish.<br />However, eventually the noise of screams, breaking glass and even a screeching tyre noise (suggesting to me that some effects have been added in for comic effect) becomes tiresome. Only the hardcore fans of Diesel's gravelly tones will make it through two hours of this.<br />Astonishingly, this video doesn't feature subtitles which is a disgrace.<br />Unimpressive, and a poor addition to the Diesel collection. Leave it alone. Leave it!
B00005RJ1U|2.0|\\"Jeepers Creepers\\" is a movie I remember hearing a lot of mixed buzz about. Some people\critics hailed it as one of the scariest movies ever! While others said it ranks among the worst ever made. I had wanted to see \\"Jeepers Creepers\\" when it was firsted released,but, just never got around to it. Then, one day I just decided to rent it, since I'm a fan of the genre.<br /> \\"Jeepers Creepers\\" is a movie I think that does have some suspenseful moments. I also think the film's first half bour is brilliant. And by that I mean, it's set-up is wonderful. The suspense slowly builds up because we don't know what kind of movie we are in for. We have no way of knowing where this plot will take us. As for dialogue well, the film suffers, and the movie has too many loop holes that don't bring the movie together, plus, it just gets plan silly. But, I'm getting ahead of myself here.<br /> \\"Jeepers Creepers\\" starts off as a brother and sister Trish (Gina Philips) and her brother Darry (Justin Long) are driving home from school. Soon they encounter a strange driver on the road who nearly runs them right off the road. As they drive on, they see him again, this time, he's off the road, and they see him throwing bodies down a pipe. Now, all of this believe it or not works. But, what happens inbetween this, doesn't work.<br /> First of all, the two kids start talking about their mother. Okay, what about her? I don't know. They say that she's change, that she;s not herself anymore. OK, why? Does she have a physical problem? Is she breaking up with her husband? Did her husband die? Or is she just lonely? We never know. Information is given to us, but, it's never completed. We know Trish (Gina Philips) breaks up with her boyfriend, why? The writers were just trying to make this characters have a conversation for the film doesn't become boring until the action happens. But, why make the characters talk about things that won't have anything to do with the movie. We don't want to hear it. Why not try writing USEFUL dialogue?<br /> After the first half hour, the film become odd, but, I was willing to go along with it. We find out something about the driver in the begining of the movie (don't worry I won't spoil it). And then we start to second guess our opinion of why we rented this in the first place. So now, the film just becomes silly. Here's an example, the kids are soon told they whenever they hear the Harry Warren song \\"Jeepers Creepers\\" expect trouble. Never in all my life would I have expected the song \\"Jeepers Creepers\\" to represent evil! Also, we are told that the \\"crepper\\" attacks ever 23 years!

He might be able to actually make a good, scary horror flick one of these days. He just needs to prepare himself better. That's what really breaks this film. The elements are there for a good movie, but, they just weren't used properly. Maybe \\"Jeepers Creepers 2\\" will be better. Who knows. I personally would advise you not to watch this movie. If you like the teen horror genre I prefer \\"Scream\\", \\"I Know What You Did Last Summer\\", and \\"The Glass House\\".<br /> Bottom-line: Suspensefull, but ultimately silly horror film that just doesn't scare us enough but makes us think of what could of been. Decent acting, so-so scrpit.not try writing USEFUL dialogue?<br /> After the first half hour, the film become odd, but, I was willing to go along with it.

B000002UA0|2.0|I'm a Pink Floyd fan, but this record is extremely dated and I actually had to laugh while listening to some of it. I guess you have to be on acid to love it. Listening to Sgt. Pepper's or Blonde on Blonde or A Love Supreme and then putting this on is painful. Some of the songs sound like they were recorded with toy instruments and I can't believe a critic could sit through this and actually think its classic. Two Stars for the novelty and unintentional comedic effect.
B00007BH5C|4.0|The soundtrack to the second installment of Lord Of The Rings brought mixed feelings to me. In general, it didn't sound like a soundtrack that can easily stand on its own, i.e. outside of the movie. The music combined the epic character of the movie's &quot;good guys&quot; (Aragorn and company), with a more sinister sound that went very well with the dark moments around the two towers, and a bucholic celtic sound that was unmistakably stapled to all the scenes with the hobbits in them. However, the songs that really stood out to me were the more glorious ones that had something to do with the scenes with elves, in general, the songs that counted in them with the presence of the great voices of Isabel Bayrakdarian, Sheila Chandra, Elizabeth Fraser and Emiliana Torrini, which closed the movie in a very eerie way. All in all, a good soundtrack with a handful of great songs and a very Braveheart-like sound to most of the rest of them.
B00005JLS0|4.0|Good, Light Romantic Comedies are few and far between as are actors capable of pulling them off. The days of Cary Grant, Marilyn Monroe, Katherine Hepburn, Carole Lombard, etc are long gone. Once in a while though, moviemakers come up with a good one and \\"Two Weeks Notice\\" is one of them: substantially helped along with the Charisma, Charm and talent of Sandra Bullock and Hugh Grant.<br />Even though I was a fan of Bullock's \\"Murder One,\\" most want to see her only in these light comedies as in her hit last year with \\"Miss Congeniality.\\"  And Bullock has the business-savvy and intelligence to hire the best writers and directors as in Marc Lawrence here.<br />The story of \\"Two Weeks Notice\\" is a trifle: filled with witty repartee between Grant and Bullock and involving a love/hate relationship standard in this type of genre film. With so many of last year's films turning out so deadly serious, this is a relief and a palliative to all that earnestness. Ditto with J-Lo's \\"Maid in Manhattan.\\"<br />\\"Two Weeks Notice will provide you with an hour-and-a-half of smart, funny dialogue performed by two of the best practitioners of this difficult art. And whereas many current comedies require that you leave your brain parked outside at the curb, this one requires that you bring it in the theater with you.
B00006JDVV|1.0|When I saw the previews for this I was interested. It takes something on the order of a &quot;Lord of The Rings&quot; movie to get me to the theatre so my wife and I waited until Reign of Fire was released on DVD before seeing it.<BR>Good thing, too. If I had shelled out theatre admission prices I'd have been truly disappointed.<BR>To describe how poorly made this film is would waste your time almost as much as actually viewing it would be.<BR>Avoid at all costs. If you're in the mood for a Dragon film, just pull out your copy of &quot;Dragonslayer&quot; and watch it again. You would be better served by that vastly better film. You still have your old VHS or laser disc copy, yes?
B00005U8EM|5.0|I first saw this movie when it first came out with my parents.  I couldn't really remember it.  Maybe it's the fact that I fell asleep when I saw it with them.  I never really wanted to see the movie because I thought that it was dumb even though I never watched it.  I saw it on television just a few years ago and it is the craziest most funny movie I think that I have seen in a long time.  It is one of those \\"Oh, Gee The Story of my Life\\" films.  It lets us know that life is too short not to have fun and go do what ever we want.  It let's us see our life choices and options and other paths we could have taken.  If you could change one thing in the day would you.  Bill Murray gets the chance in Groundhog Day in his motion in finding the likeness in tradition and the love of Andie McDowell.  The repeating days just allow him to fix his mistakes in a comical evolution.  Joke is played different everyday.   I really love this soon to be classic comedy. Two Thumbs Up!!!
B00005JL78|1.0|...as many as I could find just to drive through SOME of the many holes in this plot.<BR>For the life of me I can't understand why this film has been so well received critically.<BR>My wife and I discussed this film's failures for two full days after viewing it. Once a conversation would begin it would lead us into more &quot;well what about this&quot; and &quot;how did that&quot; type of threads.<BR>Certainly the film was interesting to look at, but was ultimately only swiss cheese.<BR>Glad my copy of the Blade Runner DVD arrived a couple of days ago. I could always watch The Matrix again, too. Two films of which I never tire.
B00000JCOV|5.0|This is perhapes the greatest metal CD ever made by enybody, ever. The never ending assult of hard and heavy beats, complamented by the intense vocals by Corey Taylor (before he went to Stone Sour of coarse) not that there is anything wrong with Stone Sour, in fact they are an awesome band, and you should get thier CD as well. Getting back to Slipknot, if you even remotly like heavy metal (or whatever you want to call it), and even if you don't oyu should go out right now and get this CD. Even if you already have it, go out and buy another copy. Although Slipknot is just one of the great bands on RoadRunner Records. So the next time you are in a record store, just look for bands signed with RoadRunner and I asure you that it will be a great album!
B000002GF8|5.0|Synchronicity   -- the Police.<br />This is arguably the best album by the Police; it is certainly the one that fixed them into immortality on the charts in the `80's.  Despite several Top 40 hits to its credit (Synchronicity II, Wrapped Around Your Finger, Every Breath You Take, King of Pain), Synchronicity is nevertheless one of the more original sounds from that era, or even since.  <br />The Police are distinguished by a heavily Reggae-influenced style in a decade when Reggae was all but unknown in the U.S.A.  Sting is magnificent as the lead singer, his voice spiraling out of his natural range in a weirdly perfect complement to the music.  Sting also has the credit for most of the music and lyrics, which tend toward the politically- and environmentally-conscious :<br />\\"Another industrial, ugly morning Grandmother screaming at the wall<BR>We have to shout above the din of our rice crispies, We can't hear anything at all<BR>Mother chants her litany of boredom and frustration, but we know all her suicides are fake...<BR>Another working day has ended, Only the rush hour hell to face<BR>Packed like lemmings into shining metal boxes, Contestants in a suicidal race.\\"<BR> --Synchronicity II<br />.  His thoughtful, poetic style, which later matures in his solo albums, is in evidence:<br />There's a little black spot on the sun today, that's my soul up there...<BR>...There's a flag pole rag and the wind won't stop, that's my soul up there...<BR>There's a king on a throne with his eyes torn out There's a blind man looking for a shadow of doubt,<BR>There's a rich man sleeping on a golden bed, There's a skeleton choking on a crust of bread.\\"<BR>--King of Pain.<br />Yet in keeping with the upbeat style of music, there is no trace of melancholy in Synchronicity, whatever the subject.  The lines are delivered with ironic flair, as if the Police are daring the doomsayers of the 20th century to take heart and find energy and hope in themselves anywhere they can.  <br />Synchronicity is not only a standout in any `80's collection:  I would especially recommend it for anybody who would appreciate unusual, smart pop music with Reggae and Jazz overtones.  <br />-Andrea, aka Merribelle.
B0000714B5|3.0|After a long wait Siddhartha was released on DVD. The first impression after watching this movie was-disappointment. I had read the book numerous times and knew the ups and downs of the story very well. But the stregnth and depths of major chracters was not played with the intensity as was portrayed in the book. Some of the sequences which were brilliantly concieved and told by Hermann Hesse lost its way in the movie. The relationship between Siddhartha and his childhood friend Govinda was shown very superficiously. The character of Vasudeva which is very deep and intense in the book was not taken seriously. The most memorable part of book where Siddharatha meets Buddha was shown in a hurry. <br />Although movie doesnot live to the expectation of one who has read the book but still it has some very positive aspects. Cinematography and locations are extreamly good, the rendering and music of Tagore's poetry is absolutely marvelous.

B000008H1Y|5.0|For my money, this album and the next (_Heavy Horses_) were the greatest Jethro Tull have ever produced. At any rate they're my two personal favorites.<br />This one came as a surprise to nearly everybody. Sure, Tull had incorporated some elements of English folk into its music. But what Anderson &amp; Co. did on this album was altogether new.<br />Anderson had just moved to the country, you see, and Tull's music reflects as much for about three albums in a row (the third is _Stormwatch_). In particular, the music on this album marks a tremendous shift away fom the dark, ambiguous, ominous broodings about urban life and such that had marked so much of Tull's work from roughly _Benefit_ to _Minstrel in the Gallery_. Things started getting a little darker on _Heavy Horses_ and even more so on _Stormwatch_. But this one is pure light.<br />Not &quot;lite,&quot; though. This is some of the most complex and engaging music the band had ever created, and part of the reason is undoubtedly that Anderson made extra-sure to give everybody a chance to contribute to the pot.<br />The personnel were right, too. The lineup at this point was a dream: Martin Barre (of course) on guitars and other stringed devices; Barrie Barlow on drums and percussion; John Evan on keyboards; David Palmer doing orchestration and playing some keyboards himself; and (the late and much missed) John Glascock on bass. This lineup also appears on _Heavy Horses_, but Glascock tragically died before _Stormwatch_ was completed.<br />Anyway, this is just a great bunch of songs. There are lots of Celtic influences as Anderson pays homage to his Scottish roots, and Barre particularly shines on the grand &quot;Pibroch (Cap in Hand)&quot;. (A &quot;pibroch&quot; is a kind of bagpipe song; Barre does a fair imitation of that instrument's &quot;flavor&quot; with a reverse-echoed electric guitar. And the instrumental portions are so long that the band called it, and in concert used it as, a &quot;pee-break&quot;.)<br />The rather darker _Heavy Horses_ is every bit as good, but I reviewed that one a long time ago and won't repeat myself. Anyway, Tull and Anderson have never released anything I would call a _bad_ album, but these two include what I believe to be their greatest moments.r />The rather darker _Heavy Horses_ is every bit as good, but I reviewed that one a long time ago and won't repeat myself.

0446310786|4.0|I just got done reading this book. Harper Lee was the author of this novel and she did an excellent job on writing the piece. the novel concentrates on the development of a very interesting child. Scout is her name and the story is told from  her point of view. it has very good detail and it is easy to understand. Three children spend there time together and learn so much through out the story. A very inspirational man known as Atticus ficnh deals with alot of problems and not only of his own but as well as for the people living in his community and he guides the children on the right path. This book is very compassionate and dramtic. Harper Lee consists of this to be a love story, i like to think of it as a touching piece that has way more to it than just a love story.
B000002KKD|5.0|I was a kid when I first saw the B52's on SNL back in like 1979.  I turned down the TV sound because I thought that they looked weird.  And they did.  But my curiosity got the better of me and I turned the sound back up.  They were playing Rock Lobster.  By the end of the song, I was hooked!  Badly!  <br />And so my friends were all hitting the teenie bopper disco scene and I never did fit there too well.  Here was a band I could identify with.  This music really did change my life, because it reminded me that it is ok to be different.  And it made me happy and the music isn't boring, ever.  \\"Let them go on to the disco,\\" I said.  And I danced around my room to Rock Lobster, and finally scraped up the money to buy the B-52's vinyl a month or so later.<br />Thus started my love affair with the B52's and this (now) CD marks the pinnacle of my music collection.  As an adult, I appreciate the creativity of this band even more now that I recall and understand its historical context.  Enter the B52's during a time when disco and long-haired rock were dominating the charts.  Enter the B52's, a sound quite different than anything I had heard before, and anything I have heard since.<br />This album has been a source of solace for me throughout my life.  It reminds me to be me during times when I feel different.  Sounds cheesy, but there is nothing like hearing \\"Planet Claire\\" or \\"There's a Moon in the Sky\\" to help one remember and celebrate one's individuality and uniqueness. So what if I'm on my own planet?  I like it here!  And ya know, even coming across another B52's fan is a further reminder that I am not alone.<br />As an adult, I can't help but still dance around my home while listening to this CD.  This is great party music, whether the party is for 1000 or the party is for 1.  This piece of work can always be counted on to raise spirits and remind us of our place in this world...or.. another world.  Ha ha!  Go B52's!!!
B000060MMI|5.0|As an Irish dancer, and a mom to two Irish dancers, I am always on the lookout for anything cool that is Irish.  Accordians and flutes can get old after a while, and the kids like more upbeat music.<br />As a retired punk, I can really get into the music.  The energy is just incredible.  While the cd can't capture the energy of the show, it is still a fun cd to listen to.<br />Now, to explain to my 10 year old why he can't get a fake id.  If only they would play an all ages venue out here.

B00005YXZH|5.0|One thing it won't do is elicit a neutral response.<br />If you love it, even the miscues will sound intentional and the highlights will grow with each listen.<br />If you hate it, you will struggle to make it through the album once.<br />It's an offensive album. It assults your conception of what an album should sound like. It isn't Summerteeth, and it's not pop. This is not the CD to pick up as a representation of Wilco. That's what Summerteeth or perhaps even Being There is for. <br />I's hard to compare this to something as universally gooey as Pet Sounds... perhaps it's more like Radiohead's Kid A. You can love it or hate it, but you just cannot ignore it. <br />If you have a chance to hear just one track from the album, perhaps the most representative is Poor Places. <br />For me, it was the best CD I picked up last year in a good year for sublabel and independent music.
B00000IPAX|4.0|Okay, I'm way too old for this CD. Maybe not old ... but as a mother of two small children, it just seems wrong for me to love this CD so much!

But when they're not there ... :) So if you see a thirty-something mini-van driver who is rocking out to blink-182, smile and wave!

B00006J3WH|5.0|I am a Buffy fan, and like most, loved this episode - so I'm biased -- but I really love having this soundtrack!  There are a lot of really fun numbers in many musical styles.  &quot;Under Your Spell&quot; is, to me, the breakout song that I can't get out of my head.  The lyrics throughout are clever and witty, sometimes self-referential (&quot;I think this line is mostly filler&quot;).  If you're a Buffy fan, you'll probably love this cd.<br />If you're not a Buffy fan... well, know going in that these aren't (for the most part) trained singers, and there are times you'll cringe because of that.  On the positive side, they're all giving thier all and very committed to their characters.  I agree with what others have said, it would help if you've seen the episode (or read the script, which is published and also well worth having for Buffy fans!).  The instrumental pieces from other episodes, particularly &quot;Hush&quot;, are outstanding and require no knowledge of the show to appreciate.<br />If you like fun, catchy musicals, especially campy/fun ones like &quot;Bat Boy&quot; or &quot;Little Shop of Horrors&quot;, you'll likely really enjoy this cd.
0060278250|5.0|Abhorsen starts out with a bang (literally) and only gets better as the story progresses. This book is truly a worthy successor to Sabriel and Lirael. <br />As readers of Lirael will remember, Nicholas Sayre and Hedge the necromancer are digging for the two silver spheres that bind Orannis, the Destroyer. Releasing Orannis will mean, effectively, the end of the world. So, all Lirael, Prince Sameth, and company must do is stop them.<br />Of course, that couldn't be any harder, for they face legions of Dead, Chlorr of the Mask, Hedge, and Orannis himself, who was once the strongest of the Nine Bright Shiners.<br />This volume also finally reveals the true natures of Mogget and the Disreputable Dog, and the gifts of Lirael and Sameth.<br />The whole book is tremendously exciting, building up to a climactic battle that is one of the best I have ever read, reminiscent of the Battle of the Pelennor Fields from The Lord of the Rings.<br />Abhorsen is simply an awesome fantasy book. It is one of the few I deem worthy to be kept on the same shelf as The Lord of the Rings. I highly recommend it to all readers who have read the previous volumes.
078322687X|5.0|This is one of my favorites. As most people already know, this film is about a group of completely different individuals, all with their own conflicts, who have to share a Saturday in detention together. Basically, they all get to know each other, they talk about their problems, gradually help each other out and become great friends while doing so. This is one of the best films of the 80's, and, in this day and age, if there really MUST be anymore teen films, they need to give them over to John Hughes. He is one of the best. <br />This movie is superb in every way. Nothing is forced or corny (except for some of the out-dated dancing sequences) but thats about it! The performances are phenomenal, and just about everything else is, too. SEE IT if you haven't seen it already.<br />Highly recommended!
B0000027K7|5.0|Some consider Led Zeppelin IV, Black Sabbath's Paranoid and Deep Purple's Machine Head as hard rock's holy trinity, but I think &quot;Mountain Climbing&quot; belongs right there with them. Leslie West's fat guitar and powerful vocals along with Corky Lang's pounding drums and Felix Pappalardi's smooth voice, heavy bass and production skills makes this album a primer in what hard rock should be. The songwriting and performances are exuisite throughout. There is not a dead spot on this album. Felix Pappalardi's production, which helped make Cream's albums so great, is carried on in Mountain. Besides the cowbell laden hit &quot;Mississippi Queen,&quot; this album also has the grinding &quot;Never In My Life&quot; and the beautiful &quot;Theme From An Imaginary Western.&quot; In contrast, Leslie West has the solo acoustic song &quot;To My Friend&quot; and Pappalardi the soft trance like &quot;The Laird&quot; to add different dynamics to the album, and both succeed. The Cream-like &quot;Boys In The Band&quot; rounds out the album with glorious &quot;woman tone&quot; ala Disreali Gears, from West's guitar. &quot;Climbing&quot; is one of hard rock's finest moments.
B000000SDB|5.0|One 20th century theologian described preaching as 'logic on fire'. A phrase that sums-up Harnoncourt's way with Beethoven! These are incandescent preformances, fiery, explosive and intense. A surprise, for the accompanying booklet says Harnoncourt has an antipathy towards the 'agitative' qualities of this music. He was determined to avoid 'the mindless heroism typical of so many other interpreters'. Well, 'mindless' these performances are not!<br />Harnoncourt has rethought every phrase, dynamic and tempo. That could have produced self-consciously, wilfully 'different' results. Individual his approach may be but the solutions seem so right. You find yourself again and again thinking 'That's exactly how I have wanted to hear that played!' These are overwhelming and overwhelmingly convincing performances of the masterpieces.<br />The Eroica is starting. The the first movement is like lightening scintillating over water. The climax driven relentlessly, generating massive energy. Certainly 'heroic'! Then with the murmurs of the Funeral March, heavy with sorrow, seeming to be darker than usual after the such dazzlingly bright 'success', tells us that Dark-night sweeps away the mightiest. <br />The 7th is also outstandingly effective. This far more than the deification of dance. This tells of ultimate triumph, transcendental hope, life, joy! The effect of the final peroration is intoxicating! (How exquisitely exciting the COE horns!)<br />Only the Pastoral seems an enigma. The first movement oddly reluctant, devoid of a vocabulary of unbuttoned joy we know Beethoven expresses.<br />Then there is the jaw-dropping virtuosity of the Chamber Orchestra of Europe, the perfect complement to the conductor's intentions and spirit (the recording so good it goes unnoticed). <br />If beauty is to be found on the edge of safety (according to Harnoncourt) then this orchestra and this conductor could not have come closer! Brilliant!
B00006NSZ5|5.0|This album is by far one of the greatest I have ever heard. You need only look at the lineup of rap superstars featured on this album to know that it is tight. The album features Eminem on 4 songs, Nas, Jay-Z, Xzibit, Rakim, D12, and 50 Cent. Most of the tracks are tight but my personal favorites are \\"Rabbit Run\\" by Eminem, and \\"R.A.K.I.M.\\" which as you might have guessed is by Rakim. This album is great because it features so many different rappers who all have skill and yet all bring a unique flavor to the mic.

B00005JKCH|1.0|The only reason this film is successful is because of September 11th. Do any of you really think this generic action film could ever acheive such a lofty standing as the number #1 movie of the year if New York City did not go through such tragedy?<br />Tobey McGuire is far to passive as an actor to carry this film. His performance during Uncle Ben's death was not very convincing especially with those forced tears.<br />How about the annoyingly over-acted performance of William Defoe? Or the absurd special effects to create Spiderman? Is that entertainment? Does anyone know what a Five Star movie truly is?<br />Comic book fans definitely have influenced the thinking of the average movie viewer with their rants all across the internet about how excellent this movie is. In reality, it is NOT an excellent film and many need to realize this.<br />It's great to know that many are finally awakening from this illusion and realizing this horrid mess is truly not quality entertainment. Just look at the responses on other movie message boards and many of you comic book fans will realize the BACKLASH IS COMING. Get ready to see a darker future for this bloated franchise
0060523794|4.0|The book is interesting in describing the world of a CEO tasked with turning around one of the worlds biggest, most visible companies. A universe most of us cannot hope to get personal insight into. If the world of the CEO or top-level IBM management is a topic that interests you will enjoy reading through this book. However do not expect a page-turner thriller or much depth in the description of the day-to-day management.    The individual chapters are well written however they do not mesh strongly enough, resulting in a feeling that the parts are better then the whole.
B00000J2KT|5.0|If your a Kubrick fan you already know that he made the best movies.  Every one of his movies are among the best of their specific genre.  Full Metal Jacket is no exception.  The great Vietnam movie is always said to be Platoon.  It won the Oscar, and it is a good movie.  But, Full Metal Jacket blows it away.  Completely.  It's a more believeable movie for one.  Second, much like another great war movie, All Quiet on the Western Front, it takes us on a journey with these young solders.  We see them as kids, and then as full-fledged killers.  The story arch is quite incredible.  And it doesn't have some dumb Hollywood ending like Platoon had.  The horrors of Vietnam are fully realized, and it didn't take a 1000 special effects to do it.  Solid acting, and a great script was all it took.  Oliver Stone, give your Oscar to Kubrick, he outdid you bigtime.
B000070WJE|2.0|Escapology is the desperate sound of Robbie Williams pricey new contract and his forthcoming attempt to, once again, conquer America.  Not the deepest of talents, Williams makes (or, rather, made) pleasantly inconsequential pop tunes for an adoring worldwide public.  He's a cheeky \\"person\\" with a talent for sincere balladry and self-promotion.  Well, the self-promotion is in full swing on Escapology; everything else suffers in comparison.  The ballads have all eyes on the marketplace.  Hard to sing about love when you're checking out your chart placement.  And the rockers are, well, Robbie, hate to tell you, but limp.  Two songs are worth your time - the jaunty \\"Feel\\", where Robbie wants to feel \\"real love\\" (how common of him), and \\"Me and My Monkey\\", a long narrative where Robbie takes his monkey to Vegas, gets high, sees Sheena Easton, and has a Mexican stand-off with a real live Mexican.  He's a live wire, that Robbie, wants to take out his \\"old fella\\" and whomp it up against your tush in the very first song.  Would it kill him to buy us a drink first?
B00005JL78|3.0|First thing... when we first see DC of the future (only about 50 years) the vast majority of the city is \\"futuristic\\" including streets for automated vehicles, rounded buildings we've come to love in futuristic movies, retinal scanners, walking talking holograms, etc, etc. Mankind did all this in about 50 years? What a jump.<BR>As for the film, I'll give you that it does have plot holes. The eyeball trick to get Cruise into the police station after he got \\"convicted\\" for murder did make me wonder. I mean, granted, all access was given because the computer recognized his retina. But wouldn't someone recognize his face?<BR>This wouldn't be a buy type movie. ...
B00006RU5B|4.0|On their eponymous debut, Audioslave is a corporate merger that, mercifully, works.  Three-quarters Rage Against the Machine (the musicians), one quarter Soundgarden (the vocalist), and the best parts of each as far as I'm concerned.  Gone is the tuneless harangue of Zack de la Rocha (bye bye, don't let the door hit ya) and the caterwauling Zeppelinisms of Kim Thayil et. al.  Tom Morello (guitar), Brad Wilk (drums), and Tim Commeford (bass) rock with unrepentant strength, and Chris Cornell checks his depressive tendencies at the door and - what a concept! - just wails.  If there was any doubt before that Cornell's the premier metal vocalist on the planet, the one-two punch of \\"Cochise\\" and \\"Show Me How to Live\\" will banish such foolishness from your mind.  And those are just the openers, with numerous highlights to follow.  For those that miss de la Rocha's politics, his solo CD is coming down the pike.  For the rest of us, rock lives!
B00005OAIE|4.0|I completely do not agree with what the so called &quot;expert&quot; has said. John Mayer's &quot;Room For Squares&quot; is an excellent album.it is mellow, but upbeat in a way. I can't seem to take it out of my cd player, i listen to it all the time.  He is a a great musician and should be credited so. Why do i give it 4 stars you ask? because there is one song that i don't quite like, but that is MY opinion. i think that anyone who even bothered reading this should definitely buy this album.
B000000643|5.0|Fairport Convention was far and away the best British folk-rock band of the late Sixties, combining elegant covers of other artists, such as Bob Dylan, who wrote three of the ten tracks on this album, with exquisite original compositions, most notably by Richard Thompson and Sandy Denny.  The group's problem has been the ever-changing lineup.  On &quot;Unhalfbricking,&quot; the third of four albums the group released in 1969, the lineup is arguable the best Fairport Convention ever had to offer, but that same year powerhouse drummer Martin Lamble was killed in an accident involving the band's equipment van.<br />Fairport Convention's style of harmony-based folk-rock was obviously influenced by American groups like the Byrds, mixing electric and acoustic guitars.  With the addition of Sandy Denny, known for both her solo work and briefly as a member of the Strawbs, the group added the premier British folk-rock singer of her generation.  Denny offers up two of her finest works on this album, &quot;Autopsy&quot; but my clear cut favorite on &quot;Unhalfbricking&quot; is Thompson's 9-minute &quot;Sailor's Life.&quot;  This it the group's epic work, the one song on which their musical legacy should be judged.  The only things that really work against this album are the fact that, by contemporary standards, it is so &quot;short,&quot; with only 10 tracks.  There is also the question of how well you like the Dylan covers; I do not find them to be anything special, especially in light of the other offerings.  &quot;Si Tu Dois Partir&quot; is the best of the trio, even if you find doing Dylan in French to be a bit odd.<br />Final Note: This is one occasion where I would argue for the purchase of a specific album rather than a greatest hits collection.  This is mainly because I have not see a Fairport Convention collection that has the four above referenced songs on it.  Oh, and, no, I have no idea what the title for this album means.
0316666343|5.0|After I finished reading The Lovely Bones, I had many different feelings about the book. Overall, I felt that the book is excellent. From the very first page it kept me interested. Just to see how a book about a girl murdered and her tales from heaven. Reading along, as she tells about her family and as she watches them try to figure out who has killed her. Alice Sebold, I think did a real good job portraying the feelings and emotions of the family through her words. She also wrote a book entitled \\"Lucky\\". It was written in memory of when she was raped when she was eighteen years old. She said she always wanted to write and become famous, but it took her a very long time to become sucessful. The Lovely Bones tied in however in the sense that it was about a girl being raped and killed. Although it doesn't sound really attention grabbing, I could not wait till I could sit down and read it again. I had thought that from the beginning i could kind of guess the end result of hte book, but it was a real suprise. What I had suspected to happen and what I had thought would happen, didn't. In cases such as rape and murder, you always hope that the bad guy gets what he deserves. This book is definatly on the top of my list.ead it again.
0553582445|3.0|If you were a fan of the original Assassin series, you're not going to be disappointed with this sequel.   I wasn't.  As everyone else has mentioned, you pick up the thread of Fitz's life 15 years after the last series.  Hap has grown into a teenager and Fitz's life has become a dull routine until the appearence of The Fool draws him back into court politics at Buckkeep Castle.<br />I only have two \\"complaints\\" that really didn't even stop my desire to tear through this book.  The first is the slow unraveling of the tracking of Dutiful.  The second is the inconsistancy with which she portrays Nighteyes.  Not to give too much away about the story, but early on in the chase Nighteyes points out that Fitz may have to renew his Assassin skills in the hunt for Dutiful and kill again.  Later when he needs to torture a prisoner to get information, Nighteyes comes up with an unwolflike conscience and puts a stop to it.  WHAT?<br />But like I said, it's an excellent read and doesn't disappoint.  The characters, as in the Assassin series, make you root and cheer for their various dilemmas.  A good page turner that you will want to fly through as fast as you can.
B0000700KQ|5.0|I thought this movie was great.  It embodies all that I love in a David Lynch movie: hauntingly beautiful music, weird themes, complicated charracters, surreal uses of lighting and intertwining plots.  I have to admit that those who haven't watched at least three of his movies prior to this might get a bit lost, but then again that's what the rewind button is for.  In any case, I highly recommed that this movie be seen by all, especially those who enjoy mental challenges.  This movie is weird, but in a good way!  I don't want to say too much about the plot itself because I don't want to give anything away.  Watch it!
0793518326|5.0|this is an excellent! it includes about every song ever done by the beatles! it's great because it has the music for all the songs as they did them! it's also a great refrence for lyrics. definitely buy this!
1400031346|2.0|This book received two Booker Judges' Special Recommendations in 1999 and was voted one of the International Books of the Year and the Milennium by the Times Literary Supplement, which can either be explained by British sentimentality or British condescension, but not by any special literary qualities. If you're looking for the Botswana version of Miss Read, this is your book. This isn't Inspector Morse transposed to Africa but  tales of English village life, and the result is, to say the least, disorienting. Furthermore, the \\"cases\\" that Mma Ramotswe, No. 1 Ladies' Detective, investigates make the Hardy Boys look like Sam Spade.  Mma Ramotswe drinks bush tea, not Twinings, but reading this book is like slowly drowning in a weak brew with far too much milk and sugar.
0425170349|5.0|This book was very interesting to read. It was the very first book that i have read that kept my interest from beginning to end. In this great novel you will have the ability to see pride, honor, bravery, and many other extraordinary traits in the many characters through out the story. If you like reading great action packed, edge of your seat fiction that will have you constantly anxious to discover what is yet to come in every part of the story, then you will love this novel. <br /> I highly recomend this book to readers with a reading level above the elementary level. The story may be extremely long and parts may get boring for some people depending on your attention to detail in this book. I still recommend this book higher than any other I have read.

B00006C79E|4.0|I was a little worried about Saint Etienne. After their most recent studio release, &quot;Sound of Water&quot; (2000), I was afraid that the group had already reached its zenith, and was on its way down. With &quot;Finisterre&quot;, the venerable British synth-pop group has regained the glory of albums such as 1993's &quot;So Tough&quot;, and 1998's &quot;Good Humor&quot;. The CD flows exceedingly well, and the positive energy remains constant.<br />&quot;Finisterre&quot; opens with the lead single, 'Action', a solid, if unremarkable tune. Next up is 'Amateur', and that is where things really kick in. It has a hummable melody, and catchy lyrics. The same can be said for 'Shower Scene', 'New Thing', and 'B92'. The rest of the tracks all hold the album together admirably. It is a fun musical excursion, and reinforces why I like this group so much. The production is glossy and superb. The synths really shine, and I also like the inclusion of pre-recorded voices, special sound effects, and the narration between each track by British actor Michael Jayston (whom I still remember fondly from my childhood as the sinister Valeyard in Doctor Who).<br />I wish there were more groups around like Saint Etienne. Since their inception in the early 90s, they have, for the most part, stayed true to their sound, and what a wonderful sound it is. Lush synths, awesome melodies, and Sarah Cracknell's beautiful voice. &quot;Finisterre&quot; captures that sound once again, bringing sweet music to our ears.
076790592X|5.0|This is quite possibly one of the best books I have ever read.  Mitch Albom was right on when he wrote this book.  It will give people a guide to life for many years to come.  It has given me lessons about life that I would otherwise have to learn by myself later in life.  This book is everything it is made out to be and more.  It is a must read for every person whether old or young.  It is guaranteed to change your life.  This book takes you through all the major points of life and allows you to understand them better.  I wish that I could one day be as brave a person as Morrie Schwartz, the books main character.  Even with a deadly illness he still found the time to teach those who were willing to learn around him.  This book has helped me to find my way through some of the more difficult parts of life that I would have struggled with otherwise.  This book goes through Morrie schwartz's remaining weeks on this earth on which every tuesday he spends with Mitch.  We as readers get to experience Morrie vicariously through Mitch.  If you have not read this book you must place it on the top of your must reads list, because you will never forget this book after you have read it.
B0000640VO|5.0|this is the best movie ever. just get it and fall in love with it.
B00004VWA7|5.0|Up there with Charlie Mingus, Ron Carter and Stanley Clarke,  Jaco Pastorius very much deserves to be among the legends of jazz. In my opinion, he's on of the unsung heroes of jazz fusion that never got his just due. This is a must buy for all aspiring bassists.
B000055Y0X|5.0|DR. STRANGELOVE is one of the greatest satirical movies ever made on any subject. It raises some very frightening questions which are still pertinent. Is it possible for one mad general to trigger World War III and a nuclear holocaust? Are there any idiots in positions of power at the pentagon?<br />At the time the film was released in 1964 the Cuban missile crisis was very much in the public consciousness and an affirmative answer to the above questions seemed possible. Hopefully there have been enough safeguards put in place to prevent any such catastrophes from ever taking place.<br />In a movie filled with several stellar acting performances Peter Sellers manages to stand out. He plays three very different roles as the former Nazi scientist Dr. Strangelove, a British officer and the American president. Pay attention because you may not recognize him as President Merkin Muffley. In the role of Captain Lionel Mandrake he serves as an aide to Brigadier General Jack D. Ripper. Sterling Hayden is brilliant and hilarious as the insane Ripper who launches his bombers for a nuclear strike against Russia. George C. Scott is superb as the hawkish General Turgidson and Slim Pickens is outrageous as Major T.J. Kong who pilots the B-52 which manages to penetrate Russia's air defenses.<br />The film received Oscar nominations for Best Picture, Best Director (Stanley Kubrick), Best Actor (Peter Sellers) and Best Adapted Screenplay. The competition for awards was intense in 1964 with MY FAIR LADY winning the Oscar for Best Picture.
B000066NW0|3.0|This album is very cute and very fun to listen to. However, this doesn't even come close to the category of punk rock. She has the look of a poser punk rock girl, but her music is more like what Ms. Spears would make, as opposed to bands like the Misfits, Fugazi etc. So if your expecting this girl to be punk, you will be extreamly dissapointed, but if you like pop you won't be.
B00006RCNW|5.0|I still remember seeing promotions for this show when watching repeats of The Practice on FX, months before it premiered.  It really had me pysched to see it, it was shown as a tough, gritty, no holds barred cop drama like we have never seen before.  The problem was the dates kept getting pushed back and I forgot about it until after the season had already started.  I came in during the middle, but since then I have never left.  The Shield delivers on it's promise.  It is the not only the best cop drama on television, it is the best drama of ANY genre.  Like Vic Mackey, The Shield pushes boundaries and sometimes breaks them, when it comes to censorship.  <br />The first season has many highlights, but for me there are a few that stick out in my memory.  First is when the serial killer case is finally solved.  Jay Karnes, who plays Dutch, the detective on the case, is in top form in this episode.  It is an unforgettable, award worthy performance.  Second is the season finale.  The riots that break out are the perfect backdrop for the chaos going on in the LAPD and specifically Vic Mackey in that episode.  <br />Vic Mackey is a character that is hard to know how to feel about.  On the one hand, he does many many good deeds and is all about justice.  On the other hand he has committed horrendous crimes himself, even killing a cop (the Internal Affairs informant).  We should despise him, yet I find it impossible to do.  Michael Chiklis (many of you may recognize him from The Commish, although he has gotten in shape since then) plays Vic flawlessly.  There is no fault in his performance, not in any episode.  He deserved the Emmy, but it was still a surprise win.  To beat out HBO's Six Feet Under AND the West Wing AND 24 is no easy task.  <br />This DVD has many extras, but the main thing for me is the commentary.  It is rare to get commentary from the cast at all, but to get commentary from cast and crew on EVERY episode is amazing!  Deleted scenes and outtakes are alsoon the DVD, as well as cast auditions which will be interesting to see.  Overall this DVD is well-packed with extras and above average as TV show DVD sets go.<br />This show is recommended for any fan of serious drama.  It is never formulaic, never repetitive, never normal.  It will blow you away.
B00005JL96|2.0|Lilo &amp; Stitch is one of Disney's gems, along with The Emperor's New Groove.  Too bad both of them were not &quot;qualified&quot; enough to make it to the Walt Disney &quot;Masterpiece&quot; collection.  <BR>  This particular movie has wonderful backgrounds, and the human character designs are very appealing.  Unfortunately, the DVD does not provide an animation fan with ANYTHING--director commentary, character model sheets, background shots, storyboard comparison...none of this is on the DVD.  Just kiddie activites like &quot;Take a trip to Hawaii!&quot; and &quot;Let's make an alien!&quot;  At least they put the movie in widescreen.<BR>    Hopefully they will provide us with a 2-disc special edition with the good stuff...the stuff that made this movie a gem.
B00005CCA9|5.0|For many years, rumours had circulated about a live Berlin performance of Rachmaninoff's 3rd concerto by Argerich which was said to swipe all comers away, but no one seemed to have a copy of it, or to even have heard it until finally in 1995 it was released by Phillips on CD.  By this time I had heard many recordings of this most opulent of romantic concertos, but even my familiarity with the piece didn't prepare me for this performance.  From the opening bars, the depth of the artists commitment to and empathy with the music is graphically displayed.  Her passion and the sheer selflessness and generosity of her performance makes this an absolute beauty.  <br />Recorded live and therefore in one single take, this interpretation is certainly not as flawless as some of the studio recordings available, but as any jeweller will tell you, the flaws in the stone are an intrinsic part of the diamond, it nevertheless displays why the thrill of live music still exists and moves us as nothing else can.<br />One problem thought is that the original 1995 edition was coupled with an even more mercurial live performance of Tchaikovsky's first concerto, under Kiril Kondrashin and this is definitely worth seeking out.
B00006V9A0|5.0|it's good that this album came out in the world of britney and pink and christina, backstreet and n'synch you get the point. or on the other end papa roach and limp bizkit. kurt would have been sicker than his normally aching stomach could imagine with today's garbage. this is good for music today, if the young kids give it a try. listen all you middle and high schoolers this is passion art genius chemistry, from three guys whose sound is fuller than any five dancing goofs could ever hope to achieve. and if you like it, go try sonic youth and the melvins and faith no more and jane's addiction and the breeders and the amps and soundgarden and from there you'll find even more and you won't believe all this incredible music was happening only 10 short years ago...
B000068QY7|4.0|Whatever the British tabloids say about the brothers Gallagher, they can certainly knock out a decent tune and long term that may be their salvation.  But since the wild days of 1995 when the classics flowed from &quot;What's the story morning glory?\\" the lads seemed to be a little pre-occupied with other things and their music suffered accordingly.<br />Heathen Chemistry reverses that trend; parties, babies, fights and divorces later, normal programming has been restored.  &quot;Hindu Times&quot; is the finest track they have yet released, but based on &quot;Little by little&quot; Noel should leave the singing to Liam.  But this is the album that should have followed morning glory, it's just a pity that we've had to wait 7 years for it.
B000002HHB|5.0|Natalie Merchant is a GOD. Her voice is perfect for every song on this CD. This CD has been my #1 pick for many years now.  Nothing I own can come close to this. For anyone who doesn't own this CD.....BUY IT. I have no favorite song on this CD, I love them all. We usually go out and buy a CD for one good song. This is a true find, every song is better than the next.
B00007E8V4|5.0|I was a bit skeptical when I heard the first track (Chic N Stew), seemed a bit a redundant and lacking of System's more intellectual qualities. But even this i began to appreciate for operatic grandeur and simple but truthful message of the nauseating amount of advertising we're exposed to (as Kazaa users, or those who still watch TV know all too well).<br />The rest of this album however left me know question, this is the best ...system album yet. BOOM, A.D.D., Mr. Jack, Ego Brain, all absolutely incredible, and the rest are only but hair beneath. The single, Innervision, is actually probablly the worst song on the album - still not a bad song though.<br />Basically Take System and Toxcity and add more harmonies, politics, song diversity, and unique progessions and you get Steal This Album. I would however reccomend that if you do steal this album you get a burnt copy as its been 3-days since I left my original copy at a friends house and Im having a hard time finding good quality mp3s to satiate my withdrawl
B00000I924|5.0|The album has a great mix of blues to go along with modern rock and techno style songs. Jeff Beck can still play the guitar as good as anybody. This album blew me away! It far exceded my expectations.
6304806434|5.0|I first saw this movie upon its video release in 1997, and was more than disapointed. However, I had been recently blown away by another Nick Cage film called &quot;Face Off&quot; so the reasons were justifiable. But, little did I know that this film would catch up to me 5 years down the road and knock my socks off. Why? For an odd reason, My favorite actor is John Cusack (Vince Larkin) and being that I am one who likes to have a extensive DVD collection I'm collecting all of his movies on DVD (Con Air being one of them). So I buy it and put it in one day, and I was amazed, it has everything going for it. Great Cast, great story, great action, great everything. I understand why I didnt like it in the begining, I didnt know what I was watching, now I do and i love it. It's deffinitely worth owning and it's one of the most underrated action movies of the '90s.
0385503954|4.0|I have mixed feelings about Ian McEwan. I loved \\"Enduring Love\\", but I found \\"Amsterdam\\" to be a piece of shallow, over-clever trickery; \\"Black Dogs\\" is pure, distilled brilliance, while some of his short stories collections, and his earlier work, just parade a kind of smug delight with the macabre mixed with schoolboy, pull-the-wings-off-flies sadism, albeit with very precise use of language and almost coldly elegant narrative skill. McEwan has long been fascinated with the shadowy side of human nature, sometimes to the point of fetishising the grotesque. Sometimes this means intriguing, off-beat insights, as in \\"Enduring Love\\", which was a truly original and unique novel (much more deserving of the Booker than \\"Amsterdam\\"), and for this reason I keep coming back to him.<BR>\\"Atonement\\" is McEwan's most deeply humane, adult novel, and begins to plumb the depths of the very kind of McEwan-esque psychology I enjoy so much. Briony is an unlikeable yet sympathetic character - or at least I found her so. I wanted to kill her but found it impossible not to identify with her. Maybe it's just me, but she seemed to embody all the things you loathed about your younger self - precocity and hubris, shaken up with naivete in a dangerous little cocktail. I get the feeling McEwan is exorcising some of his own demons here, questioning the role of the writer, the possibility of meglomania and sadism in the role, as well as the vanity and intellectual arrogance. And, in the beginning of this novel, I discovered some of McEwan finest prose - porous, supple, richly evocative. I especially remember the passage in which the mother of the house is lying in bed with a migraine, imagining the other members of the house going about their business far away...<BR>And then the book dies. In Briony, McEwan created an absorbing character to the point where almost no other character holds much interest, or breathes. The war passages are, unusually for McEwan, simply dull. The plot sags. The novelpicks up a little again toward the end, but the damage is done, and my interest had wandered. It's a shame, because McEwan might have had another slim, perfect little volume on his hands here like \\"Black Dogs\\"; instead he pads it out, and the excess is fairly laborious. Still, I'd have to say a reccommend this anyway. The first third of the book is so absorbing and so memorable it's not to be missed.
B00006RU5B|5.0|I was very impressed with what I heard the first time I listened to Audioslave. Chris Cornell once again proves that without a doubt that he is the best vocalist in rock music. The sound of Audioslave is very similar to that of Soundgarden with just a touch of Rage Against the Machine. Anyone who was a huge Soundgarden fan, like myself, would absolutely love Audioslave because it incorporates some of the same elements Soundgarden did. Which is powerfull guitars, unbelievable vocals, and excellent lyrics. Audioslave also offers something that I really wasn't expecting which was the fact that a lot of the music is somewhat softer whenever you compare it to Soundgarden and Rage. \\"I am the Highway\\" and \\"Like a Stone\\" are very good examples of using a softer tone in their music. \\"I am the Highway\\" actually uses an orchastra for most of the song, which I found to be very impressive.<br />For anyone that wasn't a big Soundgarden fan but was a huge Rage fan and that is expecting to hear a sound similar to Rage then you may be disapointed. Although, Audioslave does use many of the unique guitar riffs that Rage used they do not incorporate any type of political theme in their lyrics nor is Chris Cornell(the vocalist) rapping.<br />Eventhough Audioslave has touches of Soundgarden and Rage in their music, it really is a new sound to the rock music scene and hopefully Audioslave can bring Grundge/Alternative Rock back to the top of the music scene.
B00005JL78|2.0|I expected a lot more of this film, and wasn't left with much in the first place.  Basically, most of the plot twists are quite predictable and not very intelligent.  Nothing in it really provokes feelings of amazement, except the opening.  The surprises and twists that come along are not executed very well.  I kept wishing that there would be something to really surprise me or throw me off cue in the film, but it stayed too safe and linear.<br />From a person of Spielberg's calibur, you would expect some impressive content.  In fact, you do receive impressive content, but most of that is superficially based and not based on a solid plot.  You can predict a lot of what is coming, and in the end it's just a good movie and not a great one.  I had lofty expectations because of the people involved with the film, but those expectations were never met.
B00004STPT|5.0|I love this cd.  When i saw the film the first time one of the things that got to me was the music.  It was intense in some parts, and beautifuly executed in others.  It was pwerful adn mournful at the same time, and truly enhanced the film.  The soundtrack fits perfectly with the movie, and when you listen to it you can picture the film, scene by scene, action by action.  This is the only cd i have ever heard that has moved me, and i am sure that it will never be bested.  If you liked the movie, GET THIS CD!!
B00005RHGK|3.0|This movie starts out very well, but it weakens toward the middle, and the ending is poor.  The brother and sister team worked very well together, and came off as being very real and natural.  The creature in the film was very well done, also, and I highly commend the actor who carried out this role.  The gargoyle-like creature was terrifying to look at, especially when he was carrying his ax, and I would have liked to see more of him in the film, as the special effects were quite good.  What was really lacking in this film, though, was background information on the creature. All through the movie I wondered if the creature was a gargoyle, something unique, or what, but  no background was given in the film. Some may say that this unknown element added mystery, but I felt that it left gaps that weakened the storyline. More spooky background information from one of the townspeople in the movie would make a sequel more interesting than the original, in my opinion.  I wouldn't rank this as a very scary film, but it had the potential to be terrifying.

B00006RAKP|4.0|The US edition of Elton's greatest hits show how great Elton was and still is. <br />The back catalogue is simply brilliant. The 80's catalogue full of great pop hits. And  with \\"sacrifice\\" from the perfect comeback album \\"Sleeping with the Past\\", he returned to his calssic writing which lasted through out the 1990's. <br />\\"I Want Love\\" and \\"This train don't stop\\" prove that there is a lot more to Elton. So why didn't he included a new song? That's the only reason why I didn't give this album 5 stars!!!<br />This is a greatest hits everyone should know and buy.

Spielberg has brought us some of the greatest movies (Jaws, Raiders of the Lost Ark, Close Encounters), and it is safe to say that he is one of contemporary America's greatest filmmakers (certainly one of the most influential), but with Minority Report he failed to reach the greatness found in his previous movies. Tom Cruise is one of our biggest box office draws, and with good reason, he's a great actor. But Cruise has always been stronger in dramatic roles rather than action roles (compare Magnolia with Mission Impossible). And Philip Dick is one of our greatest science fiction writers--ie, Do Androids Dream of Electric Sheep. I haven't read 'Minority Report' but it has an interesting premise: in the near future 'Precogs' see murders before they happen and the PreCrime Police arrest the perp _before_ the murder takes place (which causes the philosopher in me to ask all kinds of questions), but a mistake is made, and the chase begins. Unfortunately the movie is predictable from the beginning all the way through to the end. The effects, which were touted as magnificant, were good, but nothing like what you find in The Matrix or the Lord of the Rings. It's an entertaining film, one I'd say rent and watch, but I'm not sure about purchasing the dvd. This movie could have been so much, great writer, great actor, great director, but in the end, it simply fizzles.
B00004XMV6|4.0|This film has some disturbing implications, possibly misogynistic, but is worth watching for its visual beauty, not to mention Kim Basinger's beauty.  It looks like a 2 hour long perfume commercial, very stylish and attractive, well-edited, not many slow moments.  All in all, though, it's just a slightly more risque bad-relationship movie.<br />A more disturbing film about sexuality, and of much higher artistic quality, is Bernardo Bertolucci's \\"Last Tango In Paris.\\"
B000063DHL|5.0|Iron Maiden,need I say more.Somewhere in time is one of their<BR>best album's ever.What more can I say it's a classic and<BR>a masterpiece.Buy this album,you won't be dissapointed.
0316666343|5.0|The Lovely Bones took a horrifying situation and made it into something beautiful - the enduring love of a family touched by grief.  I couldn't put this book down, all the while thinking of my own sister and our childhood.  I shed tears for the Salmons, but this book also made me celebrate family and long for my old room in my parent's house, when life was simple and everything was touched with mystery.
0316666343|5.0|This book has made me look differently at my own body, and at everything else that has a bone in it. Like for example the turtle soup I had last week at Richard's place: A human bone was swimming in it. Now you wonder: Why was it swimming? Well, I don't know, but then, I am not a turtle. So I just tried to fish the bone out of the soup with my teeth, and to hit Richard's mother on the head with it, but she would not let me, and gave me a kiss instead.<BR>This was the greatest day of my life, and the worst review I have ever written. Please do not vote that you found this useless.

B00005Q4CS|5.0|Absolutely amazing. I've seen a lot of movies that supposedly are 'lifechanging', and this is the only so far to come close. I had to sit there in the darkness during the credits and soak in the amazing and epic story I had just watched. Buy this movie, everyone should view this film...it should be law.
B00003CXI1|5.0|Harry Potter is one of the most enchanting of the last 4 years. Like they say, you cant doubt the oranges on the lemon tree.<br />Harry Potter was the silver lining in a smoky cloud of movie madness and mediocre. It is a movie to be treausured by the young, old and the imbetween. <br />It is to watch with wisdom and power, not to mention joy and popcorn and sorrow at times. <br />Listen to these words and you have not seen the light of Harry Potter yet, then you are missing out on a must.
B000069HZP|5.0|This is one of my favorite movies, but not one that I recommend to everybody. It is a mind game (hence the title), but one that is not super elaborate. The way it is played out takes a convoluted intertwining and lays it out in a long line. You are never sure, which as a hallmark of a great suspense movie. The acting is solid, but not great. The transfer to DVD is very good. If you want to give your mind an aerobic exercise, as opposed to an anaerobic one, this is a good movie to get. Michael Douglas, Sean Penn (surprise!) and Deborah Unger do excellent jobs of acting and making it all real.
B00006F83Y|3.0|OK, after having heard about this album for quite some time I finally stepped up to the bar and ordered it. While not, generally, a fan of metal (speed, death, nu, or otherwise) it can have its moments when done right (see Faith No More, Morbid Angel, et al). After a few listens of \\"Songs...\\" though, I am thoroughly unimpressed. The production value seemed muddy to me, the guitars, bass and drums all seem on the same register and the notes (and there are plenty of them!) get lost on each other. What results is just a wall of sound - literally, occassionally broken up by Grohl's drums or a voice from a mock-radio. When the vocals are actually understandable (Homme utters - sings seems to be the wrong word - his lyrics on the same register as the bass, drum and guitars) they are decent to good and seem to have a common theme enough to carry a 'concept' album. I give this album 3 stars because when it is understandable (when it pokes through the muddled mess) it is excellent - especially Grohl, who seems to have taken his off-time to exorcise demons. Like I mentioned in my title though, maybe I don't listen to enough metal and this is 'unbelievably good' for this genre; but when I compare it to the masters (past and present) of metal it falls short.
B00000255F|5.0|If you only own one Springsteen album, this is the one to get. A relative, who is single and very mobile, goes to all the Springsteen concerts. He has been a roadie of sorts, at times, helping out and even lunching with the Boss. He says that this is THE album to own. I have to agree with him. Although many will be familiar with &quot;Born to Run&quot; and &quot;Backstreets&quot;, the other songs are very strong and welcome additions to this classic album.
0060245867|5.0|The whole If you series is a fun set to read.  The little mouse is adorable and the story can be told to any age.  It is a great bedtime book.  The mouse and his energy and enthusiasm allows for the child to get into the story.  I love this book
B00005JKJA|3.0|whats up with the lack of bonus materials? and no chapter selection?
B00003CX8Y|4.0|I loved the Movie. But the new movie with the new scene the the color is bad. Also I had problems with the second disc not working. I have tryed disney and the place (not amazon[.com]) that I bought and none have gottne back to me on dic two not working. The only thing that is good about the new movie is that they have a not of behind the scene stuff. which I like.
B000002USN|2.0|My rating is based on the fact that the music is decent at best, consist of a strange mixture of artists, and I feel cheated that none of the artists were in the studio with The Chairman. One reviewer wrote, \\"The way Bono sings this one with Frank brings new life to this classic.\\" Well, it's simply not true that they were \\"with\\" each other. I know of no other duets recording where the star lays down the tracks and the guest artists come along and sing to the tapes afterwards. In addition, Frank's voice simply in not up to par with his earlier recordings. I'm 35 and I love Frank Sinatra but I have to objectively say that this is one to pass on.
B00005JL78|5.0|I'm a Tom Cruise fan, but am able to distinguish his good films from the bad. I loved this movie for its creativity, ingenuity, and uniqueness. Many movies nowadays are altered reincarnations of other movies that don't differ much. It's refreshing to see a movie with a unique, and interesting concept. The movie does require one's attention so that much isn't missed, but overall, not too bad to follow. As far as any plot holes that one may complain about, they're insignificant issues that can be dismissed without taking away from the overall plot of the movie. I was torn when I saw A.I., so it was refreshing to enjoy this Spielberg film. Loved it!
0060536977|3.0|The story goes as follows: Jack, a computer programmer who worked on grouped processing is out of a job.  His wife Julia has an executive position with a company that is using Jack's programs to develop nanotechnology spy tools for the government.  The technology comes to life, goes berserk, and Jack is called in to figure it out because he understands the program.  With a few interesting but highly implausible twists (as if the whole thing isn't somewhat implausible) Jack ends up saving the day, but in doing so kills his wife who has in part caused the mess.<BR>    I enjoy reading Michael Crichton novels because he usually teaches you something about science.  What I find more interesting about Crichton is that he seems stuck on certain notions, namely Chaos Theory.  Perhaps it is true that nature is uncontrollable (to a degree at least) and that, try as we might, we cannot predict what life will do, but how many times can you use this as a plot device?  This was the entire story to Jurassic Park I, and II, and III.  He does make an interesting point about psychology and how individuals may be very insightful of the problems facing other people but are usually pretty bad at understanding their own psychological problems.  Overall the book was interesting to read but not my favorite Crichton novel.
B00004RFFS|5.0|The very best vampire film ever made. This film has a great plot awesome special effects and superb acors and actreses.Order it as soon as possible, because it's a hard movie to get a hold of once you decide you wan't it. the set is great and the speccial features are almost enjoyable as the movie itself. I can't say enough good things about this story. Make sure to get the vampire chronicles series by Anne Rice. Everything about this purchase is great,you can't go wrong with interview.
B00006AFUR|4.0|At first glance, one would think '30 Seconds To Mars' is just another Hollywood actors flamboyant dream of being a rock star. Russell Crowe has tried it before, as has Keanu Reeves. Both failed. Yet Jared Leto obviously has had the right inspiration and perception, along with his cohorts, to make a quite elegant and soaring rock LP. With clear linkage to futuristic themes, '30 Seconds...' has infused long drawn guitar riffs with blinding 'Tool'esque vocals, creating almost epic climaxes. Not bad for a first effort.
0743455967|5.0|I don't particularly like Stephen King's books or writing, but I really enjoyed this one.  It is basically in two parts - his journey with writing and advice for writers.  It is very readable and quite funny.  Although this is a hack way to simply this book, a few points:<br />1) Writing is like a fossil.  The skill of writing is comparable to an archeologist's skill in unearthing the fossil without damaging it.<br />2) Read a lot and write a lot.  There are no shortcuts.<br />3) Create truthful characters and exciting situations and let them lead your writing.  Plot will develop itself.<br />4) The writer and the reader meet halfway.  As a writer, set the stage and call the reader to you.<br />5) It's always about the story.<br />6) Show don't tell.<br />7) Write until it the book is finished without sharing it with others.  Then take two weeks off to digest and reassess.  Then edit mercilessly and take 10% out.
B00007E8V4|5.0|I dont care what anyone says! This album is the best! Toxicity was great but i think this one is a bit better! All of the songs are awesome. BOOM is great and so is A.D.D. But the others are great too! EVERYONE GO OUT AND BUY! UNLESS U DONT LIKE EXPLICIT LYRICS!
B00006JJ1O|4.0|... what can I say about this release comparing it to the original Russian CD released in 2001? One word: overproduced. One suggestion: get the original release (,too). No, I'm not stating Trevor Horn and others have ruined the songs, but their love for heavy guitars, their need to make adjustments at any price to get the title &quot;producer&quot; have sort of... umm... blurred the original brilliance. Just compare &quot;All The Things She Said&quot; to &quot;Ya shosla s uma&quot; and &quot;Not Gonna Get Us&quot; to &quot;Nas ne dagoniat&quot; and you'll get my point. Furthermore, if you buy the Russian version you'll get a hidden pearl not included on the international release - oh-so-melancholic and yet catchy &quot;Ya tvoi vrag&quot; (I'm Your Enemy).<BR>4 points for leaving most of the original taste untouched.
B00005JLSC|5.0|I'm giving the movie version 5 stars, but it isn't as good as the Broadway version.  The movie version is a little choppy where the songs are interrupted by dialog. Never-the-less this is a great attempt to bring a big Broadway Musical to the screen and for the most part it works.The cast is excellent but none of them have the style of a Gwen Verdon, BeBe Newith, Karen Ziemba or Chita but the cast does bring a fresh look that should attract non-musical audiences that may not of bothered to see this film if it were all Broadway stars. (At least they had the good sense not to have Babs in the movie)The supporting cast is equally as great and Christine Beranski as Mary Sunshine is great! A true well-rounded and very talented actress.  This movie should be a great hit for 2003 and with hopes of other new musicals to hit the screen.  But \\"pleaseeeee\\" to you Hollywood people.  Make sure you do you homework before attempting another musical. Hollywood does lack good directors who know how to adapt a Broadway Musical into a film.  Other than that this is a GREAT film. You'll have fun and you'll be totally entertained and if you haven't seen the Broadway version this is a pretty good start.
B00005OWIU|5.0|We bought this cd for our little girls. The youngest LOVES the music in the scene where Harry walks through Diagon Alley. <br />Unfortunatley when we listened to the cd, that particular excert was nowhere to be found. The track that is labeled Diagon alley is totally different. What happened.???????
B0000009OP|3.0|Credit should always go to those innovators who shed the conventions of rock and roll to reinvent the craft.  Traffic's \\"John Barleycorn Must Die\\" was recorded almost completely without guitar.  Blood, Sweat and Tears put brass back in the blues in \\"Child is Father to the Man\\". The Stray Cats stripped rock to a hollowbody electric guitar, bass, and stand-up drum kit. The Replacements sang the beer-soaked lyrics of their Minneapolis roots.<br />In like manner, Morphine comes up with something original here. It's refreshing, innovative, and musical to its core. My personal favorites are Buena and A Head with Wings. But I really must take exception to all the reviewers who give this effort five stars.  It's a CD I'm glad to have, but that rating has to be reserved for the top ten percent of my collection, which this just doesn't make.  I look no further than another great Boston group, the Either/Orchestra for a higher rating.
0684803356|3.0|For a school project, I was asked to choose any book and write a review.  I have never been a big fan of Earnest Hemmingway, but I was up for a challenge and I chose one of his works.  For Whom The Bell Tolls is Hemmingway's novel on the Spanish Civil war.  It goes through the struggles that an American, Robert Jordan, goes through in order to help the Spanish guerrilla of the mountains overcome the fascist government.  It follows him through the struggle with the people of the mountains, and what he must do to keep his newfound love. It includes many of the past stories of the characters and has a lot of character development in the 471 pages that the book contains. In it, he is given the task to blow a bridge in order to keep the fascist army from reaching the mountains during a guerrilla attack. The storyline is good, but there is a lot of extra and unneeded material.  I had a lot of trouble reading this book because of the fact that it went on many different tangents about the past lives of the characters.  Some of these stories went on for several pages and got very confusing at times.  Hemmingway used many different names for the characters, which tended to make it a bit more confusing.  It bothered me that instead of saying Robert or Jordan, he always wrote Robert Jordan.  He used very little pronouns and it made the book drag on for days.  Many of the sentences were repeated several times, and that, too, made the book long. At certain points in time, I felt myself screaming in my head for him to say it once and be done with it.  But all in all, the storyline was good.  I haven't always been a big fan of Ernest Hemmingway, and I was hoping that his book would change my mind.  But in the end it was more frustrating than fun.  The book makes you want it to come to an end.  If you have a lot of time on your hands like a long car ride or a really long vacation, I would recommend this book.  But if you are looking for something that won't take you very long to read and is easy to understand, then I would suggest reading something a little different.  As for the school project that I had to accomplish, I think this book gave me something easy to write about since the plot was so thin.
B00005K9LM|5.0|I'm directing this review to those unfamiliar with Priest, not the hardcore fans.  As we all know, the majority of Judas Priest fans consider this a solid album, but not their best.  For me, this is the album that made me a fan, and though it may not be the best, it holds a special place for me(everyone has a favorite album like that).  Sure, I had heard of Judas Priest, knew &quot;Breaking The Law&quot; and &quot;You've Got Another Thing Comin'&quot;, even owned Painkiller.  For some reason I never became hardcore until I bought Defenders on a friend's suggestion and listened to it about four times.  That did it for me.  So, I'd like to think that for the people curious about Judas Priest, this album would hopefully do the same.  But prepare yourself, coz you'll want the entire catalog.
1881273156|5.0|This is such common sense stuff and it really works.  It can be applied to marriages, children, other family members, etc.  It's an easy-read and totally makes sense, to learn to speak the same language as your spouse prefers!!  Wow!
B00006LLNU|5.0|Amazing...used to progressive's rock most complicated musical textures, to Radiohead's dreaming atmosphere and much more, I can't find direct comparisons to this CD.<BR>OK, it may not be passional, or easy-listening, or even friendly to most of first listeners,but just wait to get lost into it...<BR>This is where today's music can try to get, this is courage to be alternative and beautiful together, it's not easy, but Sgur Rs teach us it's more than simply possible.<BR>If you think you can get numb by listening to something, buy it - after that, you'll be smarter than ever.
0312117337|5.0|I got this set for a dear friend for Christmas, and she loved it!  She had been eyeing the deck for 6 months, since she pulled a card from a friend's deck that *really* struck home, and she was overjoyed to receive it.  Every time anyone that I've known has pulled a card from this deck, it's been right on.  It's amazing, and the cards are just beautiful... the book is wonderfully written and easy to understand as well.
B000002KIT|5.0|Where exactly it fits in my 'live CD's collection, I'm never sure, not being a die-hard fan of Thin Lizzy while simultaneously saluting the brilliance of the band.  They recorded too much strong material in the late 70s to have NOT released a 'live' document, and while the later double CD \\"Life-Live\\" gives you more bang for your buck, this is the better performance, in my opinion.<br />All the classics are here; \\"Jailbreak\\", \\"Boys Are Back In Town\\"<br />\\"Are You Ready\\"... but combined with scorching versions of \\"Still In Love With You\\", \\"Massacre\\", and \\"Emerald\\", it takes on the air of legend.  Most guitar bands should own this as a primer in twin-guitar pyrotechnics without the wankery.
B00005JL78|5.0|&quot;Minority Report,&quot; which works as a mystery, a sci-fi film and a pretty damn exciting adventure film, one of the best films of 2002. It is, at different points, thrilling, creepy, funny, confusing and inspired.<br />The acting is great, for Tom Cruise, in some of the scenes mourning his son, escapes his usual bravado to show some of that talent he so rarely gets to show in an action film. Max von Sydow, Colin Farrell, Tim Blake Nelson, Samantha Morton and, particularly, the scene-stealing, brilliant Lois Smith also give compelling, supporting performances.<br />The plot is labyrinth, and the payoff is, for the most part, rewarding, though the ending could've been a bit less conventional. (Why, after such a wacky ride of a movie, are we left with a chase through the annals of a hotel? And what is with that ultra-happy ending? I hear there's a theory that part's all faked, but I think that theory's a result of some disappointed moviegoers.)<br />My main complaint with the DVD packaging is the extra supplemental disc. Why create a whole second disc and put so little compelling information on it? The documentary is, mostly, Cruise and Spielberg patting themselves and each other on the back. It doesn't delve too much into the actual crafting of the movie's plot or story. It just presents it, point blank, as &quot;We wanted to work together, and we found this script.&quot; The mechanics behind the film are inspired, and I wanted to know more. I wanted commentary tracks. I wanted how-to stories about the plausibility of the future gadgets. I got a 20-minute movie about how brilliant Spielberg is. I got a four-page essay on the film work of Tom Cruise, which I already knew about.<br />I love the movie. Give me the good stuff about it.
B00003ETOW|3.0|I saw this film when I was only seven years old.<BR>I really don't know why I am so fond of this film,such as its music and the two great movie stars: George C. Scott and Miss York.And I think this is the best movie about this classical English novel by Charlotte Bronte.Many friends around me also love it to death.
0060278250|4.0|The first thing you should know about this book is that it doesn't stand alone. It and the previous novel of this series, Lirael, together form one complete story arc, and the exposition at the beginning of this third volume will seem gratuitous to those who have read Lirael and will only confuse everyone else. Sabriel and Lirael are both deeply enjoyable reads, though, so getting caught up shouldn't be too unpleasant. Once  past a slightly bumpy introduction, however, this book is easily recognizable for what it is -- a satisfying conclusion to one of the best recent fantasy series. Almost too much happens (the book is nonstop action from start to finish), all the old favorite characters return, and Nix manages the enviable trick of explaining away much of the magical underpinnings of his created world without ruining the carefully cultivated sense of mystery. In the end, this book is not as atmospheric as Sabriel or intricate as Lirael, but it shares their weight and their occasional flashes of wry humor. Smart kids will enjoy these books, but so will anybody else with a brain and even a mild taste for well-crafted fantasy. This book (and the rest of the series) are especially recommended to fans of Philip Pullman's Sally Lockhart books -- like Pullman, Nix writes female characters of unusual depth and strength.
B0000009S3|5.0|When the Hot Rats CD first came out, I remember thinking that the sound quality of the CD was better than that of the LP.  I thought the LP sounded a bit &quot;muddy&quot;, and that muddiness was cleared up/equalized out on the CD.  I have not heard the LP in about 15 years, so I wonder if my impressions would be any different now.  Seems like everybody else preferred the LP.<br />Either way, I do give Hot Rats 5 stars...with only one slight qualification...  The music is very lush, rich, and dense, kind of like a Lindt chocolate.  I can only handle so much of it before I need a break.  Then, after a while without it, I happily come back to it's splendor.
B00004W55E|5.0|Plenty of people below have already described how wonderful Rachelle's voice is - suffice to say its full of emotion and goes from a pussy cat whisper to a gnarly growl and everything inbetween.<br />Further the wild cats supporting her on this album bear mentioning: Byron Miller on bass, Lenny Castro on percussion, George Duke on keyboard overdubs among others. It's full of funked out gurus who ably support the message Rachelle has to offer.<br />Also from an audiophile point of view, the recording is superb. Ultra low lows on Sista to shake ya booty and test your subs, to the screeches on Why You Wanna Mess It All Up. Rachelle is palpably real and all her emotions come through. A pity more producers can match this level of recording finesse.<br />The album is a non-stop foot tapper through and through and the musicality and engagement makes it one of my favourite albums of all time. I just wish there was more material out there.
B00003CX8Y|2.0|Does anyone else find it disturbing that the &quot;beautiful&quot; witch turned a little boy (albeit selfish) into a monster? If you'll listen to the song &quot;Be Our Guest&quot;, you will find out that they've been rusting in the castle for ten years. And considering that the magical rose withers completely on his 21st birthday, I find it unbelievable that anyone could justify the actions of the beautiful witch....who had nothing better to do with her time than pick on an 11 year old boy.  I don't know about you, but I would advise MY children not to let strangers into the house either.
6305807086|5.0|This movie, as you've read, is off-the-wall, yet it manages to ask key questions about the nature of identity. It's funny, constantly manic yet always interesting.<br />Catherine Keener deserved her Oscar nomination, playing Maxine as this vicious shrew who managed to find and find herself deserving of love. Nearly unrecognizable under a giant, frizzy wig, ministering to animals while trying to come to terms with realizing she's a man in a woman's body, Cameron Diaz gives the best performance of her career. And the switch given to John Cusack's character, from sad-sack hero to villain, proves his range. And Malkovich as Malkovich is superb.<br />Visually, it's stunning, as well. The puppet show scenes, occasionally hysterical, are just plain neat. And the scene where Malkovich enters his own portal is a particular highlight.<br />This was the best film of 1999.

When she discovers a locked door, sensible Coraline asks about it, and her mother opens it to reveal a brick wall and explains that it is left from when the house was divided into apartments.<br />When the brick wall vanishes one day, Coraline discovers another realm.  It's a realm where the cat can talk, where dogs attend theater performances and eat chocolates, and where she enters the home of her Other Mother and Other Father, who want Coraline to stay with them forever and ever.  Coraline opts to go back home, but she discovers that her mother and father are missing, trapped inside the world of the Other Parents.<br />Coraline explains, as she ventures back through the passageway to rescue her parents, that \\"when you're scared, but you still do it anyway, that's brave.\\"<br />This book draws the reader into a world that is wiity, entertaining, and delightfully creepy.  Dave McKean's black-and-white illustrations are appropriately eerie and add an extra dimension to the text.  This haunting tale is an excellent choice for the reader of scary stories who wants something that will stay in the shadowy corners of the mind long afterward.
0316666343|4.0|Very sad book. It may be a coincidence, but around the time of Susie's death a song by Ringo Starr called \\"Photograph\\" was in the Billboard Top 5. It reached number 1 a week before. If you listen to the lyrics it seems to tie in a little bit with the book, keeping in mind that it is a work of fiction. Great book and an excellent first effort.
B00005OAIE|3.0|Yeah, yeah, yeah, I originally dismissed  &quot;Room For Squares&quot; by CT homeboy John Mayer as a derivitive, bland marketing ploy(make a teen-idolesque singer-songwriter with catchy pop tunes whose &quot;mature and sensitive&quot;, catering to the more broad spectrum of young teen auidences who'd tired of the Timberlakes and Carters of the world) but the little bugger sure is likeable, isn't he??? (laugh). <br />After awhile, &quot;Room For Squares&quot; is a pleasant, mellow listen. Very commerical and earnest yet very likeable. John seems like the type of guy that you wouldn't mind your younger sis dating, the type of guy that parents would like. The songs, while still derivitive and extremely radio-friendly, are catchy and musically on. A skilled guitarist(once you see him live like this reviewer did, you'll see that Johnny has skills) whose very free-handed, the music on the disc is very jazzy and laid back while accompanying John's on-point playing. John's voice, while not too memorable is feather-like, like a clean-cut Dave Matthews but after more listens, a good accompanyment to the laid back, jazzy settings. BUT....the only thing that stands in RFS'<BR>(a take on the classic Hank Mobley album title)way is THE LYRICS.<br />The lyrics are just too sophmoric and awkard. Like bad prose. Something that a drunk college student who tried to be introspective would write at the last minute. See, it seems that John tried to write in a slighty playful, thoughtful manner. Like a confessional, quirky reflection(see &quot;83&quot;) but the lyrics sound wishy-washy. A songwriter could help our boy with that.<br />Most enjoy
014028009X|5.0|Bridget Jones' Diary, despite some rather bad reviews here at Amazon, is definately something that most women relate to.  I've seen reviews where they were saddned by Bridget's \\"obsession\\" with finding a boyfriend.  Let's clarify this - we all want that great signifigant other that we want to love, and have love us in return!!  I wouldn't call that an obsession.  Bridget Jones's diary amplifies the modern woman's (no matter what her creed) inner thoughts, fears, desires, etc.  We all fuss over our weight gains as well as losses, and yes all single women do drink quite a bit.  I could definately relate to this book and it's heroine.  I think Bridget show us that all our efforts are not in vain.<br />Ms. Fielding's use of words is positively brilliant, v.funny, and v.poignant.  I can't wait till my daughter is old enough to read this!
B000021Y7X|5.0|Director Jonathan Demme's STOP MAKING SENSE, listed by Entertainment Weekly as one of the Essential Independent Films when they produced that list years ago, has been called, by others, the greatest rock concert films of all time. Better than THE LAST WALTZ. Better than WOODSTOCK.<br />After seeing it, not really knowing much about the quirky, catchy pop music of David Byrne and his brood, the band and the film won me over. The film starts, like the concert, with a bare stage. David Byrne walks out, alone, with his guitar and a radio. Within moments of beginning \\"Psycho Killer,\\" Byrne's tripping all over the stage, falling all over himself, stumbling into the edges of the film frame. With that, he begins to show some individual, I-am-not-a-rock-star personality. When the staging does come, when the band joins in the fun, that personality expands.<br />And when it comes time for the giant suit, this film's more than just a concert. It's become a story. The story of the band, the story in the lyrics and a commentary on how abstract visual art and obscure, obtuse music can interact.<br />Demme never shows the audience through the film, though you can hear them, for the film is just about the band, the stage. It's not about the reaction they get.<br />It's fascinating, and you'll find yourself a fan of Byrne's music, as a result.
B00003CXSP|2.0|\\"Hannibal\\" by Thomas Harris is a rich, dark, pseudo-Gothic exposition of one of the most infamous characters in modern fiction, Hannibal Lecter. Surrounded by the strange characters one would expect to inhabit his extraordinary, yet psychotic life; the brilliant FBI agent Clarice Starling, feminine and vulnerable, yet tough, strong-willed and obsessed with executing the letter of the law; meat magnate Mason Verger, physically and mentally deformed and utterly consumed by revenge upon the man who left him in such a state; his steroid-abusing gym-junkie sister Margot; the quiet, enigmatic Barney; Florencian detective Rinaldo Pazzi, who dreams of glory and fortune when he stumbles upon Lecter's new alias... the list goes on. Harris moves his doomed characters around his macabre stage as in an epic modern opera. It meshes subtle elements of literature with psychology, history, philosophy, even fine dining, while maintaining an aura of impending doom within the world it inhabits.<br />As for the movie, well, it's little more than standard Hollywood sequel material, cashing in on the legacy of its predecessor instead of attempting to be a faithful adaptation. When I learnt that Ridley Scott was to direct the film adaptation, I was intrigued by how the director of such films as Alien, Aliens and Blade Runner would translate Harris' bleak universe onto the screen. When I heard that Foster turned down a reprise of her role, alarm bells started to ring. But I was ready to give Julianne Moore a chance. What a disappointment. Moore, an acceptable enough supporting actor, seems out of her depth in such an integral lead role, and adds little to the fragility-tinged stoicism Foster wrung successfully out of the character. Hopkins is the best thing about this movie, but he's clearly cruising. Oldman could have made the complex and thoroughly warped villian Mason Verger chillingly memorable, such as his excellent roles in \\"Dracula\\" and \\"Leon The Professional\\", but he's hamstrung ina character stripped down to little more than its bare skeleton (not only literally) by the screenplay. But the characterisations aren't the only thing watered down by the film. The most criminally disappointing aspect of this adaptation is the complete overhaul of the book's ending. The fact that it jokingly leaves open the possibility of a sequel, the last thing on the minds of readers who have just put the book down, demonstrates the extent to which the film has made one of the more perverse and unusual works of fiction in modern years more mainstream for the sake of popularity and box-office success. The infamous Krendler scene seems to have been included merely for shock value and the \\"water-cooler\\" market. By that stage, however, the screenwriters had completely departed from the book and were making it up as they went along. And I had become too thoroughly disillusioned to really care. 1 extra star for beautiful Florence.
B00006RU5B|5.0|I bought this album being a huge soundgarden fan was not disapointed. I was not that big of a cochise fan but the album has many tracks that are far better than cochise. It is a great buy for anyone!
B00000099Y|4.0|Nevertheless, this cd still kicks major a**. Tool is one of the few respectable bands out right now in the current music scene, so you owe it to yourself to listen to them if you enjoy rock music. I do recommend you buy this and Lateralus, but I would pick Lateralus over this any day. This is still an great album, however, it suffers from some muddy production. Overall though, this cd is a must own for Tool fans, and it was even better for it's time. Go out and buy this and their newest album, Lateralus, you won't regret it.
B000065U1N|3.0|I admit for the situation the movie is depicting it's hard to say that I didn't care. I respect the situation, and the men who put their lives on the line. But this movie was all action. Which can be good....if you give a damn about any of the actors. I seriously didn't care about any of them. A little bit more character development would've been nice.
B00005YW4H|5.0|The music is earthy, soothing and good for the soul.  Terrific tracks.  Even my 65 y.o. mother loves it.
0316779237|2.0|This book goes from being brilliant in Santaland Diaries (hence the 2 stars) to being offensive against minorities to being simply disgusting and appalling: children being raped and murdered.  During his \\"delightful\\" trek through the holidays, one baby dies after being thrown into the dryer, and two other children are given away and found raped and murdered.  And this is funny?
B00006AW2L|5.0|Probably the best Stones recording from the Brian Jones era.  Its all Jagger/Richards tunes as there is not a cover in sight.  Paint It Black is an awesome tune to lead off the record with fabulous sitar contributions from Brian Jones.  Under My Thumb and Lady Jane were aother top flight singles from this collection.<br />However, the lesser known tunes stand pretty tall.  Love the fuzz bass on Flight 505 and the harmonies on I Am Waiting.  Doncha Bother Me is another cool riff oriented tunes.  Charlie Watts stands out a bit on moments of this tune when he crashes the cymbals behind Jagger's strained vocals.  I am even getting used to Going Home with the extended guitar, harp, and vocal jamming.<br />Truly one of their 10 best.  Give it a whirl.
B00005JKZT|3.0|If I had to really choose between the first and second LOTR movies so far, I'd really have to say this: The first film was better in that it was closer to the events in the book (yes I know Tom Bombadil was missing, that's not the point). The second film, in terms of cinematography and action is pretty much superior. But I like the book better. <br />The critics say that the biggest problem with \\"Two Towers\\" is that, as with the book, it has no beginning and no end. The characters are not reintroduced, and the quest is not explained. It's not meant to be. That said: see the first movie or at least read the first book before you see this. I found that the big problem was one constantly had with readers watching adapted films: The characters and some of the places (I.E. The winged Nazgul, the Ents, and Helm's Deep, among other things) were not exactly the way I would have represented them. But, the ways in which they are represented are amazing. Another beef: They tend to focus on three members of the original fellowship: Legolas, Gimli, and Aragorn. The parts of the hobbits are just as big, and weren't capitalized on enough. The tone of the entire film is much more dark and hopeless than one normally likes to find in a movie. Finally, a good chunk of the original book is taken out, and left for the third film. But, enough about the technicalities. On to the good stuff:<br />The battle sequences! My sweet Lord, they were AMAZING! Huge arial shots of Orcs that we're certain are CGI, only because they are too amazing and breathtaking in scale to be real. But they are amazingly realistic. Also, on comedic relief: The director knows very well that this is a very gloomy and hopeless story. So, he puts in a good dose of black humor. During a fight amongst a group of Orcs, their leader takes a look at the carcasses killed, saying \\"Meat's back on the menu, boys!\\" We have several funny moments having to do with Gimli's height problem. Not to mention the many funny parts presented by Gollum. Yes, we are supposed to be wary of him, but, just take one look at the dopey, very much schizophrenic creature, and he's so weird that you have to laugh a bit.<br />So, though Tolkein purists will have a bit of a beef with some of the storyline (Aragorn, Arwen, and Eowynn: The love triangle that may or may not go away), this is, all together, a pretty awesome film, yet a somewhat disappointing interpretation.
0316666343|4.0|This first person narrative begins with the rape and murder of 14 year old Susie Salmon, the narrator, and then progresses over the next decade or so, as Susie watches her friends and family deal with her death and eventually move on.  After her death on earth, Susie arrives in heaven, where she leads a seemingly normal life -- she lives in a townhouse with a roommate who attends jazz band classes, meets the former family dog, eventually meets other victims of her killer.  Susie describes heaven as different for different people -- it's certainly not a white clouds & angels with halos place, but it is pleasant. Susie occasionally descends from her perch in heaven to spend time with her family and friends who sometimes sense her presence.  (As a young adult, she even has an encounter with her junior high sweetie, Ray Singh -- the most intriguing part of the story from my perspective.)  She watches her killer move from her neighborhood and escape detection.  The book sounds eerie and macabre, but it really isn't. Surprisingly, even the rape and murder scene is not described in a horrific way -- it's very matter-of-fact.  The concept (of a dead girl narrating a story from her observation post in heaven) isn't nearly as hard-to-swallow as it sounds.  Overall, I enjoyed the book -- though it didn't move me to tears, it was well-written and interesting.
0060537639|3.0|In an age when writers are seeking to make the top dollars, historical accuracy can be compromised for the sake of a good story.  &quot;Pop History&quot;, as some call it, surely make for a good read if the reader is willing to suspend disbelief; yet these stories often offer up a few slices short of the whole pizza pie.  <BR>The is irrefutible proof that the Imperial Treasure fleet was real, that it travelled around the Indian and Pacific Oceans, and that it was disassembled around the year 1421.  These facts, in combination with what Mr. Menzies believes to be proof of a Chinese pressence in the Americans, lead him to put forth several interesting theories.  Revisionist Historians, ex: Howard Zinn, have been searching for ways to discredit Columbus's discoveries, and Menzies's book seems to follow along with the current trends of thinking.  Eastern, rather than western, settlement of the &quot;new world&quot; would render everything Each AMerican learned in High School about American History,and face it folks isnt that the farthest that most of our fellow countrymen choose to pursue this path, wrong.  <BR>if it were true.<BR>Although Mr. Menzies can tell a good story, he was unable to convince me of the soundness of his argument, however hard he did try.
B000065U1N|4.0|This unapologetically violent war movie achieves something almost impossible for the genre: Ridley Scott's latest work of genius (one that totally makes up for this year's absymal Hannibal) depicts an unflinching, brutal battleground where anything that happens feels completely realistic, but makes sure not to leave fans without frequent glimpses of Scott's elegant directorial flourishes. Aided by poetic cinematography and excellent editing by Pietro Scalia, Scott ably tells the tale of one terrible October day in 1992 when American troops under the United Nations enter Mogadishu, the capital of Somalia, and attempt a probe into the city to capture the country's corrupt leader. The result is a bloodbath that begins when one a Black Hawk (an American helicopter model) is shot down and a rescue of the possible surviving passengers becomes the primary mission of the day. The result is the best war movie of the year, and the very best made since Terence Malick's The Thin Red Line, with a giant ensemble cast that features standout performances by Josh Hartnett (who, interestingly enough, also appeared in the worst war movie of the decade, Pearl Harbour) and William Fichtner
B00004BZ0N|3.0|With all the hype surrounding this recording coupled with the recent death of Joey Strummer, I figured why not try this CD on for size? My expectations were a heavy punk influenced recording with searing guitars and screaming vocals. What I heard were some varying textures and instrumental definition.<br />Most of the arrangements are pretty clever. I was certainly surprised to hear some spunky regaae beats and creative horn arrangements behind the guitar, bass, and drums on such as tracks as Jimmy Jazz and Rudy Can't Fail. Some good keyboard passages exist as well particularly on The Card Cheat. Interesting vocal stylings exists as well. Love the harmonies on Death or Glory. And how about Joey Strummers delivery on the title track.<br />Certainly a likeable recording. Definitely consistent as the worst songs rate as decent and certainly listenable while the best ones are very good but not quite spectacular. This disc falls short of the classic category as as vocalists these guys are technically a bit weak.  Also no one will every mistake the guitar sounds to be anywhere near the level of Eric Clapton, Mark Knophler, or even George Thorogood. However, the catchy arrangements make this release a positive listening experience.  I can only hope that the die hard fans can respect my middle of the road views.
0345350499|5.0|This is easily the most compelling and captivating book I have ever read, and definitely the strongest tale of Arthurian times I've known. I had not expected such a wonderful story, and could rarely put it down- I stayed up till 2:00 or 3:00 in the morning some nights, afraid to put it down lest something happen in the story while I was asleep.<br />This book gives a great understanding of and reverence for the Druid religion, and its defeat under the rule of Christianity. A wonderful aspect of this book is its female views from Arthurian times; from Arthur's mother, his sister, and his fair wife Gwenhyfar.<br />Meet Igraine, sister to Viviane, Lady of the Lake.  Married unwillingly at 15 to an older man, she is a strong and admirable character.  She bears a daughter, Morgaine, and a son, Gwydion, to be someday Arthur, King of Britain.<br />Viviane, Lady of the lake, is determined to maintain Avalon, to keep the old Druid religion sacred in the heart of the King, and if not worshipped, than at least recognized, by the priests of Christianity, a religion that is slowly eating away at the old ways.<br />The pages also follow Morgaine's life, from toddler to an old woman, and capture it such that it is easy to relate to and sympathize with.  You share her sorrows and joys from page to page.  Struggle with her as she attempts to carry out the duties Viviane left behind, and save Avalon before it is no more than a myth told at the fireplace.<br />And last but not least is Gwenhyfar, beautiful wife of King Arthur. As an extremely pious Christian woman, she intends to bring about a turning point, when Britain shall fight under the cross, not under the banner of Avalon.<br />And so begins the battle...<br />I hope that you enjoy this book as much as I did, and see the Arthurian ages from a different and wonderful perspective.
B00003CXSP|4.0|Hannibal was great!  It's a great psychological, suspense thriller that just chilling and all out, a great movie.  Anthony Hopkins returns as Dr. Hannibal Lechter, 10 years after SILENCE OF THE LAMBS.  Also starring in this is Julianne Moore as Clarice Starling and Ray Liotta and Gary Oldman.<br />It's been 10 years since Dr Lechter escaped from custody and his case has been all but forgotten except by 2 people, Clarice Starling and Mason Verger (Oldman), the only survivor of Hannibal Lechter.  Horribly disfigured and scarred thanks to Lechter, Verger has been waiting 10 years to exact revenge on Dr Lechter and now the time is finally right because Verger finds him.  Agent Starling then reopens the case in hope that she'll find him first and be abto find him in time before Verger gets a hold of him.<br />Hannibal isn't nearly as psychologically scary as SILENCE OF THE LAMBS was but I will say that it has a lot more gore in it.  Here's 2 perfect examples, the end scenes and the library.  Hopkins really puts up another quality performance as Dr Lechter.  There are 2 down sides to this movie.  Julianne Moore replaces Jody Foster as Clarice Starling.  It would have been nice to have the original, but Moore does a very good job.  The other thing is that the ending might disappoint a few people.  Personally, I thought it was a good ending and it added a bit a fear to it.<br />Either way it goes, make sure you watch SILENCE OF THE LAMBS first because there are so many references to it that if you don't see it, than HANNIBAL won't seem as good to you.  I recommend this one to anyone who's into the series and to anyone who likes suspense thrillers because this one will do that for you.  Plus, Hopkins says the classic line \\"Hello Clarice\\".  Check out HANNIBAL!
B00005JL96|5.0|Appropriate for all ages is this delightful Disney film that showcases the best in family entertainment that the studio is known for. Drawn with a simpler style of animation than the computer-graphic-enhanced material that they've producing of late, this beautiful film (which looks like a living watercolour painting) centres on a misunderstood little Hawaiian girl named Lilo and her adventures with Stitch, an alien from a planet that rejected it. The two help each other learn the true meaning of family, and along with Lilo's older sister Nani (voiced by Tia Carrere who oddly enough gives her most memorable performance) they make up quite the unconventional clan. Stitch, originally an alien weapon of destruction, is given a lesson in togetherness when he learns that having love in his life is worth his putting his baser tendencies to rest. Very lovingly made, and very enjoyable, with Lilo being a particularly endearing and fun character.
6303542352|4.0|\\"House of Cards\\" may be the most fun many of us can have watching \\"Masterpiece Theater\\".  It's story tells little more than the ascension of Francis Urquart (Ian Richardson) from a \\"party whip\\" in British Parliament to the ultimate position of Prime Minister.  Schooled in the mechanics of parliaments' nastier side, Urquart outclasses those who stand between him and his prize. Aided by his wife, but finding much help in his rivals' wooden-headed resolve to play fair, FU is all but assured of triumph.  While political evils are normally excused based on their good intentions, Urquart's are so irredeemably blackened that you'll never doubt how evil a guy he is - associating himself with greed, the police state and, when that's not enough, Americans (the epitome being a loud and corpulent sod who, while Urquart has yet to become PM, discusses his plans for FU's government; to drive home what those plans entails, the villainous yank presses FU while halfway through a steak large enough to have come from 2 cows).  While FU counsel's caution, the only obstacle, ironically, is his love for a young journalist who has enough material to expose and bring his march on Parliament (like FU himself) to its knees.  Will the evil FU (who communicates to us the depth of his dark ways with an on-running soliloquy ala Richard III) succumb to love, or will he stay true to form?<br />Though Urquart wears his evil openly, he and this multi-parter are actually full of surprises.  For his wicked ways, FU is probably the most compelling hero you'll likely see on \\"Masterpiece Theater\\", and, if you're not up on that show, \\"House of Cards\\" is probably your best excuse for watching it at least once.  Suggesting Shakespearean scheming and character-destruction (besides the \\"Richard III\\" monolog, there is Urquart's Lady Macbeth of a wife, while the young reporter with whom he courts love and his own destruction hints at a coupling of King Lear with Ophelia), the centerpiece is Ian Richardson as the smiling usurper-in-waiting who breathlessly outmaneuvers his clueless enemies.  (FU implicates the PM in a stock deal over new drugs his government certifies).  Never hesitating to tell us how much fun he's about to have, FU suggests that his audience is a whole lot smarter than the Brits over whom he's to govern, even though he ends up fooling us both. Only Mattie Storin, the reporter seems to have an insight into the real Urquart, and maybe that's why we're so eager for the mean FU to take action and win out over FU the good guy.  \\"House of Cards\\" is \\"Masterpiece Theater\\" that gets you to root, even if for the bad guys.
B00006M183|2.0|Every few years or so, as Pearl Jam prepare for the grand unveiling of their latest opus, everyone gets re-inundated with PR promises of the old grunge gods breaking free from their self-imposed confines for a grand &quot;return to form,&quot; and told that, &quot;No, really, this time they've proven themselves as something more than a just the band that launched a thousand Candleboxes.&quot; Yet, while Pearl Jam have outlasted virtually all of their grunge contemporaries, they've hardly ever strayed from the classicist approach that brought them into the rock world back in '91.<br />Riot Act, their seventh and most recent album, perpetuates the notion that Pearl Jam is a tremendous rock band, despite their catalog's evidence to the contrary. Like communism, Pearl Jam is as good as it gets in theory, but it never quite seems to work out in practice: They're a hard working and talented group who use their fame to champion causes that are dear to them-- even when that means alienating fans and fighting unwinnable wars against corporate giants-- and they take full advantage of their major label status (and dollars) by circumventing traditional ways of thinking about the band/fan relationship. Through fan-club-only Christmas seven-inches and that entire tour's worth of live releases, Pearl Jam have attempted to prove that recording for the majors doesn't have to be synonymous with MTV pandering. If only their music brimmed with the creativity of their business practices.<br />Since 1998's Yield, Pearl Jam have relied on an unchanging musical formula, consistently declining the opportunity to innovate or improve their sound, even while hinting that they could if they could be assured it wouldn't completely tank. Since the genre-defining Ten, the band has given us occasional glimpses at something more unique-- most notably on Vitalogy, a wonderful, reactionary mess of an album, and then with the diverse No Code, and even Yield's Eastern-tinged bonus track-- but mostly, they've settled for traditional rock riffs and general coasting. Riot Act sadly exemplifies this, bringing them ever closer to homogenous bar-band territory.<br />The record peaks early on the opener &quot;Can't Keep&quot;, a three-guitar gallop that immediately strikes as fresh in contrast to the band's other recent work. Eddie Vedder seldom pens a melody this original, and the song's gloomy, atmospheric production compensates for the bored musicianship. From there, however, Riot Act meanders from one song to the next with an overwhelming insipidness. The devastated lyrics of &quot;Love Boat Captain&quot;, which mourns the tragic deaths of nine fans at the June 2000 Roskilde Festival, are affecting, but the song itself is a standard rocker, which seems an odd choice to accompany Vedder's poetic remorse.<br />Riot Act does momentarily pick up as it nears its end. &quot;Greendisease&quot; is the closest to new wave Pearl Jam has ever come, and the Jeff Ament-penned &quot;Help Help&quot; passes on the simple fact that it sounds at least somewhat different from the band's archetypal rock'n'roll sound, and breaks the monotony of an otherwise barren collection of songs.
B00000K3UU|3.0|Adam Sandler in BIG DADDY was O.k. as a comedy and a pretty good romantic comedy/date movie.  When I tell people about this movie (guys in particular), I always tell them that this is NOT your typical Sandler comedy (ex The Water Boy, Happy Gilmore and Little Nicky).  This one has some funny parts but for the most part, it's a romantic comedy.<br />Sandler is Sonny Koufax, your typical guy that has the right ideas but not the drive.  After a kid gets dropped off at his apartment, he finds out that the kid is his roommates' (Jon Stewart)  Sonny than tells his roommate that he'll watch the kid until he got back from a business trip.  It's a really sweet and cute father and son movie with a comedy twist on parenting.  <br />Now I went into this movie not knowing the story and me and my best friend saw this moving thinking that it was going to be another great Sandler comedy.  I can assure you that I was a little mad at first when half way through the movie we realized that it was a date movie.  I wasn't disappointed, but this is a perfect example for anyone who just goes and sees movies without  bothering to find out what the movie is about.  <br />Other than that, I thought it was pretty good.  It has a good story, the cast is great and the parts that are funny are really funny.  Steve Buscemi's character is really funny and Rob Schneider is also a total riot.  In any case, I still think it's a good movie.  If you're looking for another Sandler type of romantic comedy, check out MR DEEDS.
B00003CX5P|4.0|Solid good fun from George Lucas' fertile imagination that precedes the events in his 1977 blockbuster Star Wars (the second-most successful film of all time after Titanic at press time). In this episode, the story suffers from being overburdened by a strong emphasis on computer graphic animation: where the first three entries in the film series (which has practically become a religion for some) succeed because of their excellent character development and very tangible emotional quality, The Phantom Menace has a rather hackneyed plot and no truly sympathetic characters. Resisting the strain of this size a project can't be easy, though, and the film's stars Ewan McGregor, Natalie Portman and Liam Neeson do exceptionally well, as does Pernilla August (The Best Intentions) in a supporting role. The plot involves Queen Amidalah (Portman) doing her best to ease difficult trade relations between unfriendly planets, and Jedi Knights (McGregor, Neeson) who after discovering a force-blessed young man named Anakin Skywalker (aka Darth Vader) are compelled to escort him safely back to the Jedi counsel for closer examination (watch for the scene where Anakin's mother talks about how she conceived him-it might remind you of something...) Jake Lloyd's performance as little Anakin is terribly weak (even for a child actor) and all the obvious racial stereotypes that Lucas indulges himself in (the shady vehicle salesman has an Italian mafia accent, and the duplicitous dignitaries from the outer reaches of the galaxy are distinctly Japanese) mar the clean enjoyment this film has potentially to offer. None of these myriad of criticisms, however, can compare to the sham of Jar-Jar Binks, a character who dresses like Lenny Kravitz and has an accent that can only make one think of Prissy from Gone With The Wind. Confirmation of his being featured in the next film of the series was met with dire disapproval. My favourite part of the film, at least for historical importance, is the part where C-3PO first introduces himself to R2D2: watching the start of my very favourite ... romance in all of film history almost leaves my eyes misty. This is the first film George Lucas has directed since the original Star Wars film in 1977.

Alice has only two books but those book have became very popular very quick.she is a great new and up coming author.i really enjoyed this book very much. it explained everything that alice sebold felt and went though. the way people changed toward her and how she had changed herself. i believe that it would be very hard to write about something that would be hard to live though the first time. it was hard for me to read without feeling the pain, anger,and hurt that she wnet though and also have to overcome. the book also talks about the afterlife of the rape. This is a great book for all girls to read.
0684833395|5.0|The novel Catch 22, by Joseph Heller is dismissed by many as being a book simply about World War 2, which on the surface, it is.  However, after analyzing the novel more thoroughly, one finds that not only does it describe WW2, but it also serves as a social commentary on life at the time. Written in the early sixties, Catch 22 accuratly describes life in the 1950's using Yossarian as the voice of a generation. The novel also does an excellent job juxtaposing the of fear of death with the uncertainty and often times irony in life. <BR>This novel is a must read for anyone interested in fifties society, culture, the atomic bomb or the second world war.

0792842073|5.0|An exceptionally well done human interest story that has you talking about it long after you've turned it off. Sean Penn shows us why he is the consummate actor of our time and the best years of his career are ahead of him as a leading character actor. He is about his craft, so he was willing to take on the role of this reprehensible human beast where actors that are in the business for glamour and image steered clear of this role. He manages to give this loathsome character, that had so lustfully raped and murdered, a modicum of humanity. Academy Award Winning Actress Susan Sarandon delivers as always and this movie goes to elevate her standing as one of the great ladies of the cinema. she is the bette Davis of our generation and she has gracefully transcended into the role of mature leading lady.  Savor this movie, because as time goes on and movies become big screen adaptations of Video games, and those who star in them have no greater depth than a plastic action figure, character driven movies with compelling real life drama will go the way of the dinosaur.
B00005OAIE|4.0|John Mayer finally hits world wide appeal with &quot;Room For Squares&quot;.  I bought this album before the first single &quot;No Such Thing&quot; was a hit.<br />This album is well written, produced and arranged.  Mayer is in top vocal form who keeps being compared to the Dave Matthews Band which is completely false.  Mayer has his own style and vocal performance.<br />Songs like &quot;Neon&quot; and his latest hit &quot;Your Body Is A Wonderland&quot; are in no way the same boring drone of Matthews Band who keep churning album after album out with the same song and sound.<br />Mayer is his own man, with his own style.  This album is completely solid through and through.  A nice enjoyable treat. <br />Someones review compared him to &quot;New Kids on the Block&quot;!...Oh please.  People like this - you can show them a Monet, then a Velvet Painting of Kids with BIG eyes, and they would see no comparison.<br />This album is a definite recommendation for Adult Contemporary Music.
B000065U1N|4.0|This unapologetically violent war movie achieves something almost impossible for the genre: Ridley Scott's latest work of genius (one that totally makes up for this year's absymal Hannibal) depicts an unflinching, brutal battleground where anything that happens feels completely realistic, but makes sure not to leave fans without frequent glimpses of Scott's elegant directorial flourishes. Aided by poetic cinematography and excellent editing by Pietro Scalia, Scott ably tells the tale of one terrible October day in 1992 when American troops under the United Nations enter Mogadishu, the capital of Somalia, and attempt a probe into the city to capture the country's corrupt leader. The result is a bloodbath that begins when one a Black Hawk (an American helicopter model) is shot down and a rescue of the possible surviving passengers becomes the primary mission of the day. The result is the best war movie of the year, and the very best made since Terence Malick's The Thin Red Line, with a giant ensemble cast that features standout performances by Josh Hartnett (who, interestingly enough, also appeared in the worst war movie of the decade, Pearl Harbour) and William Fichtner
B000001FZK|3.0|Very slow. I was expecting something a bit more upbeat after hearing \\"Its my Life\\" and the best of collection. You can get a minute into a song and not even know it. Recommended for the die hard Talk Talk fan only. Even the low price doesn't justify the purchase this lo-fi set of mediocre ballads.
B00005RFAI|5.0|I never thought I'd shell out for a Pink CD!  After hearing the junk off her first CD, I figured she'd fit nicely with Britney, Christina, NSYNC, and the other bubblegummers who will never waste space in my CD collection!  But this CD is totally different (with the exception of \\"Get The Party Started\\", which is likable).  It's very personal and introspective.  The energy in her voice reveals how close these songs are to her heart.  While I'm hoping that baby-bop-pop will go the way of the dinosaurs sooner rather than later, I hope Pink just keeps getting better and better!  She is so beyond that group of non-talent.  She's got a strong, beautiful voice, and she's not afraid to be her own person, and she couldn't care less if anybody likes it or not!
0375414053|5.0|The reviews to date on this book prove that the topic of mothers working outside the home continues to be extremely controversial. That in and of itself is kind of sad. Apparently, there are some taboos that have persisted into our supposedly enlightened, liberated times -- as when K8/Kate, the heroine, gets pilloried (both in the book and by readers) for letting it slip that her husband, a nice, \\"kind\\" individual who is nonetheless content to lounge around in his bathrobe while K8 runs herself ragged, is not the primary breadwinner.  K8 is criticized (and wracked with guilt) in the book both for neglecting children, husband and home, and alternately for not being committed enough to her career.  I find it ironic that readers have jumped in condemning her from both sides as well. This is a work of fiction, not a manual on how to balance work and family, and readers who are looking for the latter will be disappointed.  I found many things in the book that resonated with my own experience as a stressed out mother with a very challenging career. My choices are not the same as K8's, but in the year 2003, it seems that we should all have more respect for women who find different paths through the minefield of motherhood and work. I found the book both hilarious and poignant and would recommend it to friends.
B00005JKBC|3.0|Tony Scott continues his reign of mediocrity with this difficult but sometimes rewarding thriller about a retiring CIA operative (Robert Redford) who is forced to go above heads and conduct some covert business of his own when his superiors decide that an imprisoned marksman agent gone rogue (Brad Pitt) is possibly expendable. Redford tells a panel of his bosses stories of training Pitt, assisting him in the field and getting his [tail]out of some serious trouble, and herein lies the film's major obstacle: the muddled screenplay crams too much in, with one rambling adventure after another, and Scott's frenetic visual style tries hard to give the plot some consistency but ends up doing quite the opposite; it's obvious after a point that he is trying to hide the fact that the story isn't about anything in particular, and for this reason the film's length will seem tedious to some viewers. Redford is excellent and completely watchable in the lead, but Pitt's character is so shallow (and the script has no idea what to do with him) that though he performs superbly he's never really all that sympathetic.

B00006I9HJ|5.0|I had never heard of Nada Surf until a good friend suggested I give a listen.<BR>Well, to say I was impressed is an understatement.<BR>If there is one band who encapsulates all of the best qualities of post-grunge it is Nada Surf.<BR>There isn't really one weak song on this collection.<BR>In fact I would say that the description of their music as 'post grunge' is a bit misleading.'Lets Go' is more powerpop than anything else.<BR>The songs themselves are fantastic.If you are looking for a musical comparison ,think of REM around the time of 'Murmur' or Coldplay when they are at their best.<BR>Lead singer Matthew Caws has a very strong voice and it is ideally suited to the powerpop material on this album.At times his voice reminds me so much of another great vocalist : Dan Wilson of Semisonic.<BR>The album opens with the brilliant 'Blizzard Of '77'.This song is a ballad par excellence and contains a simple acoustic guitar and melodic vocals.The point of the whole song is only understood when you hear the emotional line 'I missed you more than I knew' at the very end.Next up is 'The Way You Wear Your Head' which is guitar-driven rock a la REM at their best.<BR>'Fruit Flies' opens very low key but when it gets going, Caws vocals go into overdrive and the song becomes a powerpop masterpiece.<BR>Throughout the rest of the album the songs are all very strong.<BR>The best ones are 'Happy Kid','No Quick Fix' and the New Order-ish 'Hi Speed Soul'.<BR>On the evidence of 'Lets Go' ,Nada Surf have the ability to become really huge.Now lets hope that the radio DJs in the US and other places take note and give them the airplay that they deserve.
B00006RU5B|5.0|Honestly if you are a rage or a soundgarden fan this is the album for you.  This cd totally kicks ass!  Its rage without annoying vocals and its soundgarden with better instruments!  I really love it.  If you like good music buy this cd.
B00005O5CM|4.0|Reese Witherspoon's brilliant timing is the best thing about this charming comedy, roughly a Private Benjamin Goes To Law School of sorts. Witherspoon plays a fluffy, nail-painting blonde who is destroyed when her boyfriend dumps her on the eve of his transferring to Harvard to study law; apparently, this blonde bimbo is not a \\"serious\\" enough girlfriend for him. She decides to fix his wagon, so she puts together a kick-...admissions video (a hilarious speech on her law qualifications delivered while sitting in a hot tub), scores high on her LSATs and moves to the East Coast. Once there, she sticks out like a real sore thumb until her goodness and generosity win over her classmates, and to boot she really begins to enjoy the study of law! A marvelous supporting performance by brilliant comedienne Jennifer Coolidge is another plus in this Clueless-wannabe comedy that doesn't measure up to Amy Heckerling's teen masterpiece but is worthy viewing all the same.
0452282152|4.0|Chevalier weaves fiction together with history seamlessly.  A beautiful portrait of what could have been.  The author truly found the delicate voice of this fictional muse and brought her to life.  The heartwarming yet devastating inner life of the central character is a masterpiece of creativity.  It is amazing the worlds that canvas painted centuries ago can open.
0783219733|4.0|With the exception of a few more intense scenes in this film (namely the ones with the antics of the villian veteranarian), &quot;Beethoven&quot; is a great choice for the whole family. It's just a very lighthearted and fun film with real characters and a plot that is just as funny as it is heartwarming. It focuses on the Newtons, who are just a normal, happy family with their own set routine until a stray puppy comes upon them and &quot;puts the dents in their home.&quot; The father George's (played to perfection by Charles Grodin) feelings for this dog are beyond indifferent, but he finally gives in to his three young children and allows them to keep the puppy, whom they soon dub with the name &quot;Beethoven.&quot; As the dog grows into an enormous St. Bernard, the kids are having a ball with him, but George is....well, this is not quite the kind of change in his life that he had hoped for, and what unfolds are some often hilarious moments between George and Beethoven. I remember watching it over and over when I was younger, and I still love it now. <br />Charles Grodin and Bonnie Hunt are great as the kind and loving parents, and Nicholle Tom, Christopher Castile, and Sarah Rose Karr are equally delightful in their roles as the 3 kids. Overall just a really sweet, funny, and good family film.
B000056HRZ|5.0|Yes, \\"Play it!\\" is what Bogart actually commands pianist Sam (played by Dooley Wilson) to do in that timeless, priceless classic \\"Casablanca\\". No genuine movie buff can ever forget that song with those ultra-romantic lines, \\"A kiss is still a kiss, a sigh is still a sigh.\\" Bogart as Rick is outstanding in his portrayal of an idealistic anti-fascist adventurer with a facade of cynicism. It is the eternal triangle with 2 men in love with a beautiful woman, namely Ingrid Bergman as Ilsa. Her screen presence is as large as Bogie's and her elegant beauty is absolutely mesmerizing. My favourite scene is where Captain Renault, the corrupt French Prefect of Police asks Rick, \\"Why did you come to Casablanca?\\". Rick says nonchalantly, \\"My health, I came here for the waters.\\" Stunned, Renault interjects, \\"Waters, what waters? We're in the middle of the desert!\\" Rick calmly drawls sardonically, \\"I was misinformed.\\" I have seen this movie many times but I never get tired of it and I learn something new every time I see it. Another amusing thing is that many of the characters are named after cars, for example Bugatti and Renault. One intriguing question you must ask yourself is whether Rick committed adultery by making mad, passionate love to Ilsa when she desperately tried all means<BR>to get the letters of transit for her husband. Later, she schemes with Rick to leave Casablanca together and abandon her husband to the Nazis. However, Rick is too good a gentleman to break up their marraige. Instead he recues them from the Germans and then walks off into the sunrise with his good friend, Louis, saying those immortal lines, \\"Louis, I think this is the beginning of a beautiful friendship.\\"<BR>Recently, I was in the Westin St. Francis San Francisco and as I was leaving the Compass Rose, my friend the resident pianist played my favourite song for me and it made my day. It was \\"As Time Goes By\\" from Casablanca.<BR>Dr. Michael Lim The Travelling Gourmet
B00005JKL8|3.0|Taut, exciting thriller about a gung-ho Air Force soldier (Owen Wilson) who gets shot down over restricted territory during a ceasefire in early 90s Bosnia. Commander Gene Hackman wants to send a team right away to save the lone traveller, but the search and rescue mission for one man who was flying outside his allotted mission could endanger a peace treaty that once disrupted could result in a full-blown war. Wilson's casually glib performance in the lead makes this obvious war propaganda so much easier to swallow, his self-effacing humour and lazy swagger all going against the square-cut, on-target caricatures we have gotten used to in this genre. Hackman is less successful at shaking off the shackles of expectation from his role, giving a performance that is an easy spin-off of his far superior turn in Crimson Tide. The last third gets extremely ridiculous (resolve all complications with lots of explosions and loud music), but until then the action is jam packed with lots of fun and extreme tension!
0060392886|5.0|Y'know...I'd cite specific details from the book here, but I can't think of a single example that wouldn't go against amazon's review guidelines.<br />Nonetheless, THE DIRT may be the book that re-defines how rock biographies are created, written, and judged. As far as I can remember I've never heard an entire Motely Crue song - maybe a couple of minutes of the Home Sweet Home video back in the eigthies - but this book is an absolute must-read. Aside from Neil Strauss's deft abilities at capturing each of the band members unique personalities and idiosyncracies, he has to be credited with the format with he presents their story: an oral history, he interviewed each member seperately and apparently didn't inform each as to what the other had said. The most poignant example of this is after the death of Vince's daughter. Tommy recounts how he called Vince to offer his condolences and of Vince's erratic behavior at the time. Tommy then goes on to say he doubts Vince even remembers the call, Vince's behaviour being so out of control with grief. Sure enough, in Vince's next section, Vince speaks of his diappointment that none of the other guys called at the time. <br />Another element is how Strauss manages to foreshadow Tommy Lee's inevitable descent into spousal abuse and imprisonment with his behaviour throughout his entire life and the previous relationships to Pamela Anderson.<br />There are significant omissions: Vince in fact didn't join the band, he was hired to, at a fairly impressive monthly stipend. This was probably left out to maintain the seeming dramamtic comraderie for the book, but it's still a writer's device and not the strict facts.<br />But that's completely secondary. Because with the Crue, it was never about the truth, certainly not about the music, it was all about walking away from the destruction you've caused with a big fat smile on your face, a wad of bills stuffed into your leather boot, a long cigar dangling form your mouth, a drink in yourhand, and a gaggle of groupies clinging to your legs.  <br />Bless 'em.
6301095294|4.0|The magical mystery tour is waiting to take you away!! This movie is definitely not the Beatles at their fab best. If you're expecting the magic of the sixties and the hot-off-the-heels-of-Sgt. Peppers fab four to whisk you off to a psychedelic dream world, you may be incredibly disappointed, or slightly fascinated, depending upon your overall mood at the time of viewing. The swirling and colourful imagery of the musical numbers is quite fascinating. John Lennon pouring absurdly gross amounts of spaghetti onto a woman's plate in a restaurant is quite irritating. So, yes, the songs are magnificant, let's give them credit for that, but Beatles fans, please tell me, why on earth did they leave Penny Lane and Strawberry Fields Forever on the cutting room floor? For the life of me!! They really should have included THOSE videos in this movie. I guess they must have took so much drugs that they said, \\"hey, let's leave the two best songs on the album out of the movie.\\" Had they included Penny Lane and Strawberry Fields Forever, this movie would have more unity. I love watching Paul and the other boys riding their horses in the chilly London air. In the Anthology movie I recall Paul saying that this movie is played in film schools and that students watch it and study it. Yikes. I guess those students are the ones that go on to direct Olsen twins movies or something. And then the students that actually study REAL cinemotography (Hitchcock's Vertigo) go on to direct GOOD movies. But whatever, the world is probably a better place for Olsen twins movies, and it's DEFINITELY a better place for the Beatles, regardless of this little slip in the creative peak they had produced in the two or three years prior to this movie. This movie just lacks a \\"spark.\\" It's almost boring, they should have developed a better script. Or better yet, they should have put off filming this movie for a year and gotten Auntie Jess and the gang to fly over to India with the 16mm cameras and spur-of-the-moment film crew for a little Eastern \\"mystery tour,\\" and the Maharishi could have been the \\"tour guide!!\\" At least that would have been \\"interesting.\\" And we could get a scene of John Lennon trying to coax out the painfully shy Mia Farrow from her bungalow while serenading a few bars of \\"Dear Prudence.\\" Now THAT would have been worth the price of admission folks. \\"Wontcha come out to play-aaaa-hey.\\" Sure, I'd come out and play. And can you even begin to imagine the sequence for \\"Why Don't We Do It...?\\" And they could have a scene with Ringo complaining about how crabby the food in Rishikesh is while standing in the airport buying a plane ticket back home humming \\"Don't Pass Me By.\\" Well, too little too late. <br />It's a mediocre film, definitely worth owning, though, and an essential part of anybody's Beatle tape library. The remastered sound is a slight improvement, the film is still dark and murky, but great as a time capsule of the 1960's.<br />Roll up for the mystery tour!!
0345340426|5.0|I love The Hobbit so much with its descriptive adventure and loads of action.

B00005JL78|5.0|I remember the anticipation. This summer, I couldn't wait to see my favorite director's new movie. I was positive Steven Spielberg wouldn't let me down, but I never expected so great a result. Minority Report is one of 2002's best movies, and besides Schindler's List, it's Spielberg's best movie yet.<br />I was going nuts man. My armpits were sweating and I kept moving around in my seat and bothering my friends sitting around me. I mean, at this movie, the crowd functioned as a whole. Everyone went AHHHH at the same time, everyone shifted their bodies in disbelief at the same time, and everyone shut the heck up at the important parts. Seeing Minority Report on opening night was a truly memorable experience.<br />Everything about Minority Report is truly imaginative. The setting is the year 2054 in Washington D.C. Thanks to a new system called Pre-Crime, there hasn't been a murder in years. The head of the Pre-Crime unit is John Anderton (Tom Cruise). Not long into the movie, Anderton is accused of the future murder of a man he's never met. So, the chase begins. This would be easy to take in, provided we knew Anderton would be innocent. But, you have to wait until the deadline to find out.<br />As unbelievable as many of the scenes in Minority Report seem, the realism is amazing. Of course, it's the future, so the world has advanced in many different ways. There's all kind of high-tech vehicles and guns, but not once did I say, \\"that looks fake.\\" I just sat and watched. I was stupefied. Minority Report is a movie with incredible special effects, yet the movie is so darn good that they don't distract you. Here is a movie that doesn't make one mistake. It's not just excellent suspense and action; it's powerful drama. Minority Report is twisted, on-target, and beautiful.<br />This is one of the best movies of 2002.
0375414053|5.0|Of course \\"I don't know how she does it\\" is a bit over the top sometimes but it is not meant to be non-fiction but rather, as the author says in her aknowledgements, a compilation of stories & feelings shared with her by many working moms.  There were parts I didn't personally relate to but nothwithstanding it is the best read I've had in a while.  This could have been just a funny & sad story of working women if it were not for Ms. Pearson's fabulous style full of wit, not to mention imagery that was so on target I wondered if she had climbed into my head to do research for her book!  For example the comparison of a working moms head to the air traffic control tower at Gatwick with ideas, to do lists and worries all circling and waiting for further landing instructions was brilliant!  I found myself savoring every chapter, especially the \\"must remember\\" lists at the end of each one.  My husband, however did not appreciate the bits I read to him, even though I found them hilarious, so I would not recommend this as a way to show your partner his shortcomings no matter how much he may resemble Kate Reddy's husband in the book! I will agree with the other reviewers that the ending is a bit of a let down but I still would recommend the book wholeheartedly as the rest of it is excellent.  I haven't ever laughed this hard out loud when reading a book or felt soooo understood.  I am giving it to all my working mother friends!
B000002KIE|5.0|Like an A-bomb with the staid, silly '70s as Ground Zero, the Sex Pistols reduced pop culture to rubble and we're still picking up the pieces. It's difficult for me to listen to this album with any objectivity because as a teen--even though it was the late '80s--Never Mind the Bollocks, Here's the Sex Pistols changed everything I thought I knew or liked about rock'n'roll. I can only imagine what it must've been like for folks back in 1977. Suffice to say this album is now encoded in my DNA, and that when I do listen to it, I am filled with a world-destroying rage, a maniacal glint in my eye, ready to do battle against the safe, the escapist, the BAW-RRRRING culture that surrounds me. That, and get really really drunk and spit beer at my friends. <BR>So even though I could write for pages about the Pistols themselves, I'm going to pretty much stick to the songs themselves.... \\"Holidays in the Sun\\" kicks off the album wonderfully, with a powerful, up-lifting riff Steve Jones probably nicked off the Jam's \\"In the City\\" (just like he nicked gear from Bowie to start the Pistols...) Johnny Rotten faces down the ghosts of history and finds...his own face reflected there. Somewhere Greil Marcus wrote that in the final minute of \\"Holidays\\" one can hear the collapse of the world. I don't know about that, but I do know this is classic, electrifying music. <BR> <BR>\\"Bodies\\" begins off-key, nasty, brutish, and then Rotten intro's us to Pauline, who \\"lives in a tree.\\" Is this song anti-abortion? Perhaps (Rotten grew up Irish Catholic), but it's really just about revulsion at everything human.  I've never heard such utter disgust in someone's voice... mesmerizing. <BR>\\"No Feelings\\" is one of my favorites, with perfect punk sentiment: nihilistic, blackly hilarious, and absolutely self-absorbed (and a great pop chorus): <BR>I seen you in the mirror<BR>When the story began<BR>I fell in love with you<BR>I love your mortal sin<BR>Your friends aren't in the way<BR>And I love your company<BR>I only ever leave you<BR>When you got no monEY! <BR>\\"Problems\\" is insulting, accusatory and antagonistic; as the song ends Rotten spits out: \\"F*ck you--I'M the problem!\\" Thanks, John, for clearing that up. <BR>\\"God Save the Queen\\"--ah, how to do this marvelous song justice? I know they'd hate this, but it's a rock classic. Back when I sang for MY punk band, this was my favorite to perform. Who cares if I'm not English? Royalty is stupid, and that the Pistols released this song at the height of a patriotic fervor during the Summer of Hate only gives them more street cred. Plus the complete negation of its closing chorus: \\"NOOOOOO Future for you!\\" (as well as for me) repeated over and over. Denial is a good thing--saying \\"No!\\" to every stupid idea that comes down the pike is punk's prerogative. <BR>\\"Seventeen\\" has always been kind of a throwaway song for me, so let's just get to \\"Anarchy in the UK.\\" Blistering. Apocalyptic. Confrontational. Sacriligious. Devastating. The first couplet, with its awkward rhyme, sets the stage for this savage parade: <BR>I am an anti-Christ<BR>I am an anarchist<BR>Don't know what I want<BR>But I know how to get it<BR>I wanna destroy<BR>Passer-by!<BR>Johnny Rotten reduces British culture to a series of acronyms that stand for terrorist groups: <BR>Is this the MPLA?<BR>Is this the UDA?<BR>Or is this the IRA?<BR>I thought it was the UK<BR>You're just another country<BR>Another council tenancy<BR>'Cos I<BR>I wanna be<BR>Anarchy!<BR>then polishes 'em all off with \\"Get P!SSED! DESTROY!\\" The video I have of them performing this on BBC-TV ends with Johnny staring off across the crowd, no joy or humanity in his eyes, as if he is surveying the destruction his madness has wrought. Brilliance. It makes me weep. <BR>\\"Sub-Mission\\" is a pisstake at McLaren, who wanted them to write a song about, well, submission. Rotten turned it into a joke: \\"I'm on a submarine mission for you, babe!\\" Heh heh...it's still rife with sexual imagery. A good change of pace for the album. <BR>\\"Pretty Vacant\\"--another classic single, turning moral and emotional vacancy into fashion. \\"How can you make me seem a bigger cnt than I already am?\\" Johnny would taunt interviewers at the time, and that's what this song is doing: embracing all criticism and heightening it so it becomes virtue: \\"Don't pretend, 'cos I don't care!\\" <BR>\\"New York\\" and \\"EMI\\" round out the album. They're not substandard, but you can tell they were written in the studio, although \\"EMI\\" has one of my favorite Pistols moments, with Rotten screaming \\"We will be ruled by none/Ever! Ever! EVERRRR!\\" as Jones' guttural solo sets off at a roar. <BR>This album is a landmark, and words cannot do it justice. I have thrilled to it for well over a decade and it has vastly influenced my life (in good and bad ways, I must admit).
B00005JKCH|5.0|Wow. I never expected that Spider-man would be so great. ... After I saw the preview, I said to myself, \\"Tobey Maguire is going to play Spider-man? The world must be coming to an end.\\" I guess I was just out of the mix, because Maguire did a great job, and the movie is more than I ever thought it could be. It's awesome man!<br /> The movie is better than the cartoon, and that's saying a lot. Spider-man's costume looks so cool, as does the Green Goblin's (Willem Dafoe). The action sequences are fast-paced and riveting, and Danny Elfman's musical score is rich and powerful. Well, here is the real reason why Spider-man is so great:<br /> Remember how it was easier to be entertained as a kid? I do. I remember that during every Power Rangers episode (at least the old-school ones), I would wait in suspense until the morph battle at the end. ...the Megazord would take one swift swing at the evil monster with his awesome blade, and the bad guy he would fall dead, helpless to the amazing power of the Mighty Morphin' Power Rangers. See, what the power Rangers did for me then, Spider-Man does for me now. I didn't just pass the movie off as comic book nonsense. I was like whoa. Spider-Man is the real deal.<br /> And, hidden beneath all the wondrous action and comic book drama (which is by no means a bad thing), there's a message from the hero: \\"With great power, comes great responsibility.\\" Spider-man is a modern myth. I just can't wait until the sequel.
B0000024R8|5.0|This recording is of a very young Bob Dylan, and he has still yet to found his own idenity. However, this album is in the spirit of folk blues legends like Charley Patton, Mississippi John Hurt, and all of the others who were playing long before Dylan was even born. His version of \\"I'm Fixin' to Die\\" might be my favorite track on the album, for it is raw and performed with great soul. Dylan was a nobody when he recorded this album, and all he wanted to do was perform the music he loved.
B0000029GA|5.0|So... who's Nas? <br />I dunno. He's that brother who's apparently blowin' up left and right. One day, I'd never heard of him and the next he's takin' up half the posts on alt.rap. <br />Well, I'm wary of these overnight sensations and I decided not to believe the hype. But then my boy mass@mit.edu--that jamaican knockin' out jafakins--told me not to sleep. <br />So I woke up. I went to the record store and picked it up. <br />And here we are. I didn't really give it a good listen for a good while... and when I finally did I was in a pretty bad mood. I was lookin' to be upset over [my money]. I picked up the CD, ripped off the shrink rap, fought with that stupid glue seal and stared at the cover.  <br />In the end, this is a good album. I mean it ain't It Takes A Nation of Millons to Hold Us Back, but, then, what is? Look, this is more than just a collection of some for-the-moment phat beats. This will get more rotation in my ride than, say, Souls of Mischief--last year's new phat hype sensation--did. <br />Nas is a talent for sure. The lyrical beef is steak. The flow is distinctive and good. The muzak and production behind him is top notch. My only cause for complaint is that there's a certain lack of distinctiveness and originality that makes him stand out and keeps him from being more than just another damn good rapper. If he had that on Illmatic, I'd defintely be able to place him up there with the folks we'll be talkin' about five-ten years from now (I suspect we'll be talking about the album in five years, though). But it isn't too late. There's always album number two. <br />So where does this leave you? \\"N.Y. State of Mind,\\" \\"The World Is Yours,\\" \\"One Love\\" and \\"Represent\\" are pretty representative. If, after listening to those, you can feel your head boppin', go for it. If you don't feel that groove, listen to them three more times. If you still get no rise, punt. I suspect you'll be boppin' though.

B000005Z0G|4.0|Now 2Pac (that's Tupac Shakur) has been on a roll recently. After hooking up with crossover success Digital Underground, he not only has managed a pretty good solo career, he's broken into film, doing a not at all bad turn in both Juice and John Singleton's recent Poetic Justice. <br />2Pac's only real bumpy moment came last year when he became the center of the seemingly annual censorhip debates surrounding hip hop. He was not only sued by the widow of a cop who was killed by some kid who had 2Pac's first album, 2Pacalypse Now, in his car (along with George Michael's album and a bunch of other pop albums) but he became the whipping boy of the esteemed Dan Quayle, then vice-president of these here United States. <br />In some ways, Strictly 4 My N.I.G.G.A.Z. is his reply to his critics. It's a virtual diatribe against Dan Quayle and censorship and it's much, much, much harder than the sometimes too tepid 2Pacalypse Now. <br />And that's okay by me, because it's a much better album. Of course, I like that old style Bomb Squad sound. And, of course, a good scritch-scratch over some PE whine and nice bass does it for me almost every time. So I might be biased. On the other hand, it is all about lyrics and 2Pac comes correct on this tip as well. <br />So, the verdict? It's uneven but when it's on, it's on. <br />I think he needs to stop that processing his voice thing and he could do with fewer or shorter interludes. But even if he keeps all that along with the rest of the stuff he did on this album, his third effort will be one phat album. And if he drops the voice and the interludes, it might even be phat+. <br />Give \\"Holler If Ya Hear Me,\\" \\"Last Wordz,\\" and \\"Souljah's Revenge\\" a good listen. They're worth the price of admission, anyway. The album is pretty dope. Not a classic, but he's on his way. Next week, when you're picking up De La and Snoop, pick up this not-quite-new effort as well.
0375414053|5.0|I LOVED this book!  I didn't always love Kate, but that just made her more real.  As a working mom, I could relate to many of her struggles and guilt.  I am trying to go part-time to help balance my life.  This is, as Kate & her friends found, very difficult for a professional to do and still be seen as a professional.  I found myself reading bits of the book out loud to my husband (who is ALMOST as nice as Kate's).  Working is different for men, but I don't think they realize HOW different.  Reading this book might give them some perspective!  I have to admit the ending was a bit disappointing to me, but overall I think this was a fantastic and very entertaining read and I have recommended it to all my working-mom friends.
B00005JGAB|5.0|They were so stupid they were brilliant. Their songs were so short they were mini-symphonies. The formula was so obvious it took four drug-addled kids who could barely hold their instruments, much less play them, from a suburb of New York City to discover it... and once they discovered it, the world of music would never be the same. The Ramones--Joey, Johnny, Dee Dee, and Tommy--were the least likeliest of geniuses, and that is what made them great. <BR>The Ramones were the troublemakers at the pearly gates of rock'n'roll, and when no one was looking, busted the party wide open way back Bicentennial 1976. Trampling over the bloated likes of the Eagles, Elton John, Led Zeppelin, the Rolling Stones, and Pink Floyd, the Ramones paved the way for a whole rowdy slew of malcontents. All the upstarts, the dreamers, the misfits, the outcasts, the loners who didn't quite have the courage to begin before then suddenly found the Ramones holding the freak flag high: \\"Hey-ho, let's GO!\\" and it was all up for grabs... <BR>I'm not going to get into the old argument about who the first punk band was. That's not really what this review is about. But this is definitely an album that every punk rocker owned back in the day when there were about three punk rock albums ever, so think about that! <BR>You know the drill: songs under three minutes, most not reaching two-and-a-half, three buzz-saw guitar chords, a nasally, Brooklyn-by-way-of-the-UK singer, and the cute/dumb cartoon lyrics: <BR>Beat on the brat<BR>Beat on the brat<BR>Beat on the brat<BR>with a baseball bat<BR>What can you do?<BR>What can you lose?<BR>This debut album, produced in 1976 for $6000 in a studio inside Radio City Music Hall, is barely 26 minutes long. It had no hit singles. It contains uncomfortable Nazi references, a song about sniffing glue, a song about male prostitution, a Sixties cover, one romantic tune, and no solos. In short, my recipe for a perfect album. <BR>\\"Blitzkrieg Bop\\" opens the album, and if everthere was a more perfect Song One, Side One, then I don't know it. This is what the Ramones always would be about: a glorious, blissfully infectious tune celebrating the sheer unstoppable joy of rock'n'roll. To wit: <BR>They're formin' in a straight line<BR>They're goin' through a tight wind<BR>The kids are losin' their minds<BR>The Blitzkrieg Bop!<BR>They're pilin' in the back seat<BR>They're generatin' steam heat<BR>Pulsatin' to the backbeat<BR>The Blitzkrieg Bop!<BR>Hey, Ho, ah let's go<BR>Shoot 'em in the back now<BR>What they want I don't know<BR>They're all revved up and ready to go!<BR>A dozen classics, hot on the heels of this one, follow in breathless, breakneck speed, slowing down only so Dee Dee can count off one more time: \\"1-2-3-4!\\" The minute-and-a-half \\"Judy is a Punk\\" introduces the type of characters that will populate Ramones' songs for the next two decades. Tough, nutty, mental cases whose sole allegiance is to, well, the Ramones. Count me in! <BR>\\"53rd and 3rd\\" has claimed its place as one of the Ramones finest songs. Its downbeat, mid-tempo grind is refreshing after the previous on-slaught, and its realistic lyrics are an unexpected, um, treat. It's a street's-eye view of degradation without exploitation or moralizing. <BR>53rd and 3rd--Standing on the street<BR>53rd and 3rd--You're the one they never pick<BR>53rd and 3rd--Don't it make ya feel sick?<BR>Then I pulled out my razor blade<BR>Then I did what God forbade<BR>Now the cops are after me<BR>But I proved that I'm no sissy<BR>Whew. Troubled Dee Dee lived a hair-raising life in pursuit of heroin, but he doesn't glorify it. In fact, besides the hilarious \\"Now I Wanna Sniff Some Glue,\\" the Ramones refused to do songs about serious drugs. Johnny Thunders they weren't. <BR>The album ends with two blistering powerhouses, \\"I Don't Wanna Walk Around with You\\" and \\"Today Your Love, Tomorrow the World.\\" The latter song contains those Nazi references I was talking about: <BR>I'm a Nazi schatze, baby<BR>I fight for the Fatherland<BR>I'm a Nazi baby, I'm a Nazi yes I am<BR>Scandalous! Nothing really to worry about, just shock tactics from the first generation of kids after the war--they had to do something, right? <BR>So, 14 songs in 26 minutes. Before you know it, the whole album is over, but it leaves you exhilirated, inspired, dizzy. Just imagine what it must've been like to hear it in 1976! You're left with only a buzzing in your ears and a desire to figure out just a couple chords on that old guitar you never quite got the hang of. It's all power chords, baby! That's rock'n'roll. I recently listened to this album on vinyl, and it was amazing, pure aural amphetamine.
B000066NW0|5.0|I really enjoyed listening to Avril's music, it was wild, fun, crazy, all out enjoyment.  I really admire Avril for being a good role model to young girls throughout the U.S. and Canada, by not running around in skimpy outfits that leave little to be desired.  I respect that she shows that you can be beautiful and attractive without being trashy and whorish.  I also love that she's doing her own thing and that she's not a pop-singing barbie doll.
B000077VOY|5.0|These are 60's programs restored for DVD. The picture is very good considering the source, and the sound is good. There is an occasional skip in sound at the start of some episodes, but I haven't had any problems during the episode itself.<br />Stingray is a nuclear powered super-submarine capable of 600 knots while submerged. The plot of each episode either involves conflict with the evil Titan, leader of an underwater race, or daring ocean rescues. Kids will enjoy the simple plots while adults will be amused at the inconsistencies of the plot devices.<br />In the first episode, Stingray investigates the destruction of a drone submarine and is attacked by Titan's forces. This is \\"first contact\\" between \\"Terrarians\\" and oceanic people. In subsequent episodes, Stingray meets numerous other oceanic cultures, some friendly and others belligerent. All technologically advanced. There's no explanation of why some cultures hate humans, nor why friendly cultures hadn't made any sort of contact prior to Titan's attack. Of course, it's immaterial to the seven-year olds that the series is aimed at.<br />We bought the DVD's to provide entertaining TV to our kids without the sex, violence and coarseness that is endemic to modern television. There is mild violence in Stingray, but it is of the simple \\"good versus evil\\" variety, and generally abstract in nature. You might see one of Titan's submarines hit by a torpedo, but you won't see one of Titan's soldiers being killed. Gun battles are usually resolved by something heavy landing on the bad guys with enough force to stun them but no more. Good guys and bad guys are awful shots when aiming at each other, but the good guys are super accurate when they have to aim at an inanimate object.<br />Being 60's television, and British to boot, smoking and drinking are shown as normal activities by our heroes. The lead heroes are white males, but there are two strong female characters and the head of the unit is disabled. I think the design for his hovering \\"wheelchair\\" was lifted for a Star Trek episode a decade later.<br />All in all, good entertainment for today's kids and a fun stroll down memory lane for those old enough to remember \\"anything can happen in the next half hour\\" in front of a tiny black and white television. (The DVD is in color though).gn for his hovering \\"wheelchair\\" was lifted for a Star Trek episode a decade later.<br />All in all, good entertainment for today's kids and a fun stroll down memory lane for those old enough to remember \\"anything can happen in the next half hour\\" in front of a tiny black and white television.

B00005UKE0|5.0|Nice bonus tracks, especially \\"I Live for You\\".  Not sure how that one never made original release??!!.  Also, the added jam sessions are interesting, but don't really add anything to the value of the remake.  The acoustic rehearsal for \\"Beware of Darkness\\" is nice and easy to listen to. This is well worth the money that you will pay for this 2 disc cd set.  Can't go wrong!!
0780631684|4.0|... It is a very interesting idea for a movie plot, but you can't take it too seriously.<BR>... I will say that the opening crash scene got to me.  It was almost TOO realistic.  Much of the movie was humorous, but it was still very well done.  It got the goosebumps going a few times and the methods of death were always fresh and different (although I figured out the train one before it happened, most didn't reveal what the ultimate form of death would be-you just knew that something was going to happen).<br />I think it is worth a viewing, but expect some corny parts.  The ending was more funny than scary.  You'll see it coming.

B000002U9Y|4.0|The sound of early Pink Floyd, 1968 to be precise. This record is also in the line first album 'Piper at the gates of dawn', but while listening to it you would certainly feel the lack of polish in the tracks. The concept is not bad at all, only the solid sound present in later Floyd album is somewhat missing.<BR>'Set the controls of the heart of the Sun' is definately innovative and should be regarded as one of Floyd's best. Syd's 'Jugband Blues' is also good. So are other 5 tracks but production is not good and Pink Floyd was still learning the art of making an album. Except for the scattered brilliance of 'Piper at the gates of dawn' and this album, they finally mastered the art in album 'Meddle'. Then came 'Dark side of the moon' and the rest is history.<br />Fans should own this, casual listeners may skip this. Pink Floyd did not delivered their full sound in this.
6305132984|5.0|I have read some of the reviews in the 1-star section.  I think those reviewers have missed the bigger picture.  I am a music instructor and I show this film to my music appreciation classes as a prime example of the American musical theater for several reasons:<br />1.  The music is very original in comparison to other musicals of the time period (which I also enjoy, I might add).  Bernstein's score was daring and fresh.<BR>2.  The choreography is also unique.  Yes, at times it is not realistic, but it is a MUSICAL!  It fulfills a specific purpose of integrating movement with the music and creating energy.<BR>3.  The story line.  I realize that gangs are not like that.  Maybe they weren't in 1955 either, but there is a bigger story here of intolerance and bigotry, and it is simple enough to understand that kids get it!<br />As far as it being too long, bad editing, etc., I guess that is a matter of opinion.  The DVD version cleans up some of the editing problems from the video version.  Personally, I think it is great.  I also show my classes a stage version to compare it to.  As to none of the stars singing, some actually did.  Natalie Wood recorded nearly all of the songs, but was replaced at the end of shooting by Ms. Nixon's voice.  Ms. Wood was not happy about that!  She went on to sing her own part in the movie version of Gypsy.<br />Overall, I suggest that those who don't like this movie are simply looking for something that isn't there and is not intended to be there.  Take it for what it is and was...an innovation in the late '50s, and a social message for today.
B000003TA4|5.0|A pop-rock masterpiece.  This album changed my life, after I heard this album I got into the rest of Nirvana's albums, and then I got into Nirvana's influences, like the Pixies, and I just worked backwards from there.  There's no denying this album's influence, even if you look at the ... shape of today's mainstream music.  Every song on this album is great, \\"Smells Like Teen Spirit\\" will still affect you after the millionth time, and \\"Breed\\" \\"Lithium\\" and \\"Drain You\\" are fantastic songs, and \\"Territorial Pissings\\" is just plain fun.  Get this album, and don't worry about whether or not it's overrated.  Just listen to it, its good, clean fun.
0451207521|1.0|Normally I adore a thriller set in France in World War II, but so much of the dialog and the actions in which the characters engage is inappropriate for the era.  It feels like  this should have been set in the last thirty years rather than sixty years ago.  There is more focus on sexual tension than necessary to advance the plot, and the graphic description of sexual sadism is nauseating.  I cannot recommend this book to anyone.
B0000035E7|4.0|Even though I'm sure Kurt was listening to H.R. Puffenstuff by this time, he hadn't quite gotten the famous pop-punk-grunge (The Knack being molested by Black Flag) formula down yet.  I love this CD though &quot;Blew&quot; &quot;About a Girl&quot; &quot;Paper Cuts&quot; and &quot;Downer&quot; are very catchy, and &quot;Negative Creep&quot; is one of my top ten favorite Nirvana songs.  Not a good place to start on your quest for NIRVANA, but a good album to listen to while wearing flannel.
0060245867|1.0|Everyone knows if you give a mouse a cookie, its little stomach will swell up, and cause terrible pain and suffering. What kind of parent would buy their child a book that condones that? Not mine, that's for certain. Give a mouse some cheese, instead.
B000003TAR|5.0|From the first couple of seconds of \\"Serve the Servants\\" you can tell this album is not the radio-friendly, unit-shifting piece that Nevermind was. In interviews with the band about the release of this album, you can see Kurt almost gleefully proclaiming how this album will make Nirvana lose some of their cheerleader-jock Nevermind fan base. So, if you want poppy melodies mixed with noise (almost White Light/White Heat level) this is for you.  I think most Nirvana fans think that this is the greatest Nirvana album. \\"Scentless Apprentice\\" is what I think of when I think of Nirvana. \\"Heart-Shaped Box\\" is pop enough, but also beautiful. \\"Frances Farmer Will Have Her Revenge On Seattle\\" \\"Dumb\\" and \\"Pennyroyal Tea\\" are all favorites, and \\"Radio-Friendly Unit Shifter\\" will annoy most anyone much to your pleasure. \\"All Apologies\\" is one of the Greatest Nirvana songs written, one of the greatest songs ever. Even Sinead O'connor can't screw it up. Just get it!
B00005K3O4|5.0|Killer Klowns is an excellent deal!!!  First of all you get the movie...which in itself is worth the price of admission.  Just looking at it you expect a cheesy, campy, low-budget, bad movie...which is not a bad thing.  But what you get is a cheesy, campy, low-budget, bad but extremely well put together movie.  Considering the budget of this movie, anyone would be impressed with the detail of the makeup and effects.  <br />The movie itself is downright hilarious.  My favorite actor is a certian jerk cop whom you may recognize from a certain National Lampoons movie.<br />On top of the top quality horror/comedy film, you get a pretty decent set of extras which accompany the movie:  behind the scenes, bloopers, concept art, some early \\"films\\" made by the Chiodo brothers as kids, and more.  I would pay more for this movie and still enjoy it; but given the price tag, no one should pass this one up!!!
B00006LLNV|5.0|If you loved the movie, this CD recaptures the textures, sounds and intensity of the film.  Even the technical aspects of the recording are outstanding.  I didn't know what an &quot;enhanced CD&quot; was until I played it on my computer and three of the musical scenes from the film, including the tango scene, appeared on the screen with terrific resolution!  I may have to have two copies -- one for the car and one for the house.
0671042858|5.0|it's a great book.  very stephen king.  certainly worth a read.  there's a few very, very scary parts.  i'm writing this review to point out a huge hole in the plot-  midway through there's a small part where someone calls and reports that they've abducted the girl, when in fact she's simply lost out in the forest.  why?  it seems like something stephen king meant to follow up on, and just forgot about.  weird, and pointless.  otherwise, it's an awesome book.

B00007BH5C|5.0|The Two Towers soundtrack for the epic trilogy of The Lord of the Rings is simply ingenious. With such songs as Isengard Unleashed and The Uruk Hai, the sheer magnificence is overwhelming. If you have not heard this CD, I highly suggest you spend some extra money and buy it. It truely is a masterpiece and thus deserves the recognition it receives.
0446672653|3.0|I loved reading this book as it was quite easy to read, and very interesting.  I think this is the first book that I read so fast.<BR>It's mainly about the author's two patients past lives, and how they intertwined with one another, and finally got back together after so many years of being apart through time and space.<BR>This book made me believe in &quot;past-life regression therapy,&quot; and most importantly that there is a possiblity of one having past lives.  Overall I loved this book, but at times I wish it had more details, and the story ended quite abruptly.  But I would definitely recommend it to others.  Enjoy the book!!
B0000844MS|5.0|I won't ruin the plot by summarizing it, but let me say that this movie is my all time favourite movie with good reason. It is full of hidden meanings, beautiful sets, suspensful action, tear drawing moments and best of all an amazing soundtrack. I hate musicals, but this isn't a musical. It's just wonderful. The DVD version has a much more vivid picture, and being widescreen you can see hidden pictures not visable on VHS. David Bowie gives a breath-taking performance and Jim Henson does wonders with the muppets. Infact you soon forget that they are infact muppets and not real creatures! I would definately recommend this to anyone who loves fantasy, 80's style music, Bowie, or just wants to see a great movie. ...
B0000057C5|4.0|I first heard this band's cover of Depeche Mode's \\"Stripped\\" and thought it was awsome....especially Charlie Clauser's remix. Sehnsucht was their current CD so I bought it. (Since then I have gotten all the others). This is a spectacular metal disc. Every song is great, some virtually perfect. I gave it 4 stars instead of 5 because Du Hast (their signature song here in the US) is a direct rip of Ministry's \\"Just One Fix\\" from Psalm 69, and nobody can tell me that Rammstein wasn't familiar with it because Ministry has virtually sired this entire genre. <BR>Besides that, anyone who buys this album will love it, even those who normally avoid metal. It's that good.
B000002KBU|5.0|I have owned this CD for just two years now, but it is one of my favorites of all time.  The first time I listened to it I was not sure what to think.  I had never heard anything like it before.  Joni Mitchell's music is so pure and honest that it has a timeless quality to it.  Her lyrics are poetic and celebrate both joy and sorrow.  I have spent many nights feeling completely transformed while listening to the songs.
B00006JJ1O|5.0|I never thought I would like this CD but I just love it!!  I felt sort of guilty hearing it all the time at the top of the volume, but many friends like it too.  I think this is a cool, refreshing CD for everyone!
0743424425|5.0|Stephen King has been called a great many things. The Master of Horror Fiction. Fascinating. Frightening. Hypnotic. Demonic. Tremendous. Spellbinding. His own bio blurb refers to himself as the \\"world's best selling novelist.\\" One critic has even gone so far as to speculate that Stephen King is our era's Charles Dickens. Anyone who has read King would probably agree he's a writer with a tremendous range, a genius-level vivid imagination, and an understanding of human emotions both simple and yet rarely matched.<br /><br />The Shining is probably his best known novel and of the first twenty or so novels that he wrote, and it seems to me the one he wrote at his happiest. He wrote part of it at the Stanley Hotel near Estes Park, Colorado when he was young enough not to be a commodity and old enough to know what the hell he was doing. Compared to The Dead Zone, Cujo, Pet Semetary, Misery it just seems like a book he enjoyed writing more than any of the other early works. The irony is that The Shining has become synonomous with horror fiction.<br /><br />And that's the way \\"The Shining\\" works on you. Jack Torrance is a flawed man with a drinking problem, a violent temper, but a sense of humor and a genuine love for his wife and child. He's a guy we want to root for! And that's why his descent into madness is so powerful. (and so chilling) To some degree, we all can relate to him.<br /><br />Room 217. The Overlook. Grady. The hedge animals. The isolation. And the shining. All of these devices work so well together in the novel that it's hard not to picture Stephen King writing this thing at points -- a maniacal captain aboard a hotel trip into hell. The guy just gets a kick out'a writing and as simple as that sounds it's actually kind of rare in this world.<br /><br />Enough can't be said of the creative power King exhibits in The Shining. I'm sure scholars have already begun studying the \\"role of Wendy\\" as a modern woman and the \\"psychological trauma of Danny\\" etc. etc., and scholarly work on \\"The Shining\\" will probably continue long after we've all kicked off this earth. That's the world we live in.<br /><br />The novel is not without its flaws. At times, Danny thinks more like a thirty-year-old man writing as a five-year-old boy than a de facto five-year-old boy. At times, The Shining is melodramatic. The character Wendy might have been a more fully realized character. But for a \\"flawed\\" novel, it is -- to me -- the most thoroughly READable flawed novel I've ever read.<br /><br />I highly recommend \\"The Shining\\" to damn near anyone who enjoys reading and, of course, I hope this review is helpful to you.<br /><br />Thanks so much.<br /><br />Stacey Cochran<br />[[ASIN:B0024NL6QS Author of CLAWS available for 80 cents]]ing\\" will probably continue long after we've all kicked off this earth.

B00003CWPL|5.0|My first exposure to this unique and nightmarish film was on cable in the early eighties, surrounded by people who were too busy partying to take notice.  I sat glued to the screen in what might as well have been an empty house.  You could spend hours trying to analyze this movie, but in the process you would miss the whole point (understandably, many people do.) Lynch really took a knife and fork to our most visceral impulses here, dealing with a cinematic language informed by those memories formed before the mastery of speech has had an opportunity to suppress other senses.  Hideously beautiful - or beautifully hideous, rich in an aural and visual language that must be recaptured in order to thoroughly experience this film.  A masterpiece.
B000002VMH|4.0|At first sight or perception, Annie Lennox may seem an aloof, even a cold woman. But her music reveals a multifaceted personality, very intelligent and insighful. Her music is simple, although one does not always recognise its charms instantly. However, when those moments come, they are all the more rewarding.<br />\\"Diva\\" (1992) was her solo debut after more than a decade of Eurythmics career. Personally, I never cared too much for the music of Eurythmics (albeit some of their songs are truly good), but Annie's solo work emphasises her sophisticated, yet very feminine viewpoint on the world.<br />The album met with instant success at the time of its release. It won Brit Award for best British album of 1992 and in 1993 she also won the Grammy for best pop female vocal and MTV Video Music Award (both for track and video \\"Why\\"). Also the other radio-friendly hits (\\"Walking On Broken Glass\\", \\"Little Bird\\") still sound as fresh as ever and do not get old quickly.<br />\\"Precious\\" has an evident rock-soul groove to it, \\"Cold\\" and \\"Money Can't Buy It\\" wrap by-no-means-trivial lyrics in state-of-the-art, sublime arrangements. The most fascinating tune, \\"Primitive\\", is an orientally-inspired song easily able to move you to a red hot desert, with sun setting and drums beating. The spine-chilling effect guaranteed.<br />Somehow out of the line of the album are \\"Legend In My Living Room\\", a raw autobiographical portrait, and \\"Stay By Me,\\" a pop identikit which would suit most singers but with Annie it is just her average -- and a bit too long. But as a whole, \\"Diva\\" is a sample of what this great artist may be capable of. Truly one of the best albums to come from Britain in 1990's.

B00005N9CV|5.0|I've read a lot of reviews on this CD and absolutely no one has bothered to acknowledge the obvious:  a popular singer needs to surround themselves with great arrangers.  After all, that's what Sinatra did.  Unlike other comments I've read on this particular album, I'm here to state that the bulk of this album has Diana Krall not performing with a small group, but instead in a lush setting with a full string orchestra which delivers some sexy and sultry bossa nova arrangements.  These arrangements could have only been written by the master of such arrangements, Claus Ogerman.  Just listen to those extended endings on \\"Love Letters\\" and \\"Dancing in the Dark\\" if you want to hear arranging and musicality at its finest.<br />There have been critics who have panned the arrangements of  \\"S'Wonderful\\" and \\"Besame Mucho\\" as not new because Claus also used them (to great success) on Joao Gilberto's \\"Amoroso\\" album in 1977.  Still, Diana has put her own mark on these songs even though they are the same orchestral arrangements Claus did several decades ago.  They are absolutely timeless, so nothing about either track sounds dated.<br />There simply isn't much not to like on this album if you are 1) a fan of Diana Krall; 2) a fan of bossa nova; 3) a fan of fine musical standards and 4) a fan of Claus Ogerman.<br />Diana did a very smart thing in wanting to work with Claus and have him do the arrangements for this album.  It's to her credit and thanks to her excellent judgment, she may have just introduced a whole new audience and even a couple of generations to the talents of Mr. Ogerman.<br />--bj<br />January 2003

0380002930|5.0|When I began reading Watership Down, I found it to be a bit difficult to follow.  The European plants and terrain were all new to me.  However, on the second page, I slowly began to be pulled into the lives of Hazel, et al.  It is a delightful story told in an engaging way.  A must read for animal lovers.
B00005YW4H|2.0|Because of too much hype about this young lady, I bought her CD. Well, I ended up giving it away. She just could not meet my standard of a jazz singer - the likes of Billie Holiday, Ella F, Dinah Washington etc. I do not recommend this CD to the REAL jazz fans. There is sameness of style throughout the tracks. It is very boring and monotonous.
0066214122|4.0|What you get with Mr. Crichton is fascinating science/ technology and a fast, thrilling pace. What you do not get is character development or pristine prose. Every year or so I willingly accept that trade off.<br />Prey deals with the cross section of biological evolution and the computer age. Crichton does a great job of feeding the reader hard to digest scientific/ technical facts in format that is easy to understand (I think?). As always, the plot is futuristic and told in a \\"this could happen \\" style. It is a page turner and a compelling read. There is a real JURASSIC PARK feel to the structure of the novel, the character quality and behavior. It's only missing the dinosaurs.<br />I do not rate this amoung Mr. Crichton's best but it was a good read for a cold winter's night.
B000002IZM|5.0|The best soundtrack album I own.<br />I liked the film, but to me it seems that it's popular in a cult way because it's moody, different and because fashionable people want to like it. <br />However, I think the soundtrack is excellent and has universal appeal. The snippets from the film become inbedded into your head after a few listens - quoting &quot;artificial owls&quot; and &quot;attack ships on fire&quot;. I love listening to this CD when I'm relaxing. A long train journey, in a bath, or after herbal indulgences. Vangelis does a great job, I love the sweeping music and mix of musical styles apparent on this CD.<br />DJ Paul Oakenfold voted this his favourite album ever. I'm not going that far but if I'm on a desrt island and Ive got limited space - I'm taking this CD.<br />Highly recomended!
0375823360|1.0|I agree that Pullman pulled this series off with intricate plot and interesting creatures / characters. However, I cannot continue to finish book three when the story enfolds the so called dark side of God and the explicit condemnation of the name of God. The fabrication of events in heaven and the creation of man are misleading to young readers. I strongly recommend parents not to buy these books for their kids.
B000007MVL|4.0|It frustrates me that artists like Kate Bush don't get talked about now or played on the radio. It's now all about dance routines and shallow songs written by office-habiting song writers. <br />This album show what is possible when a talented person makes music without be constrained by PR and marketing men. My favourites from this album include 'Wow', 'Oh England...' and 'Kashka from Baghdad'. Time just seems to fly when listening to this album. I recently listened to it on a train journey across Holland, and in my opinion it ideally suits that sort of setting: beautiful scenery, relaxing, and looking at this world we live in.<br />OK there are a couple of songs, which, for me didn't hit the right notes, which is why I didn't give it 5 stars. But I think if you appreciate talent and someone not taking the marketing/commercial option, but instead follwoing their creative instincts - Buy this album.
B00005YXZH|5.0|I only title it what i did, because sometimes this album reminds me of a character study of one or more people and other times like a buch of poems that would win pulitzer prizes put to music. But aside from all that, i love this album generally because it just has alot of great, absolutely perfect, emotional songs. Its all kinda country music with folk-rock mixed in and even some electronica (!, but even if you dont like that type of music and you do like studying the craft of songs, or are interested in what music that remains mostly upbeat and catchy, but also artsy and experimental sounds like at best, then youll find alot to like in this. The grammys seem to have completely ignored this album, even though its the best album of the year,and this album probably has not gone platinum, but its absolutely timeless, even if not for all tastes because its a flash back to bob dylan and niel young for old folks and it has hust enough edge and wit and overall intrigue for younger listeners. i hope this album is remembered, if not by mainstream audiences, then by fans.
B00006NSZ5|3.0|Eminem is the main featured rap artist on this album...but I have to say, his songs kind of [were bad] on this soundtrack.  And what's the deal with having Macy Gray on this soundtrack???  But, I was impressed with some of the other songs by the other artists.  D-12's song \\"Rap Game\\" was great so were the song's by the following artists: Xzibit, Nas, 50-cent, Rakim (a rap legend), and Obie Trice is a funny rapper.  I think Eminem should stick to his more comical rap style rather than trying to be more serious.  I don't think it works for him.
B00006CYAD|5.0|This CD is probably my very favorite CD of anything else! It's so pumped up, and any Teenager could relate to it. The Music really goes along well with the singing. Very catchy lyrics. <BR>This is the first CD where I didn't skip any songs. Some of my favs were, \\"I'd do anything\\", \\"I'm just a kid\\", \\"Addicted\\", \\"God must hate me\\",\\"One day\\" BEST CD EVER!!!!
0679720200|2.0|I think this book was not amuzing in any such way. It made me feel disgust for the narrator. Especially with the fact that the story begins with \\"Mama died today- or maybe yesterday.\\" Through out the whole novel he does things that are not humane and his actions are presentable. Even though this book is short and not detailed I think there was more meaning behind it though.
B00006F2TV|4.0|I enjoyed this DVD (just got it for Christmas).  I did not see the film in the theatres, so I miss some of the roller coaster ride you get from the giant screen.  Tobey Maguire was perfect for Peter Parker.  I enjoyed his almost clueless personality; an direct opposite of Spiderman's heightened senses.<br />They could have found someone else for Mary Jane.  I am not a big Dunst fan, and it was hard to get past that.<br />The supporting material on the DVD is great.  I enjoyed the interviews with the previous artists and writers of Spiderman.  Also I really enjoyed the bio of composer Danny Elfman (one of my favorite musicians).  If you enjoy comic book movies that are not as dark as Spawn, this will be a great addition for you.
B00006LPER|5.0|This is a breakthrough movie--but not one that you should undertake watching lightly. The word \\"harrowing\\" best describes this descent into hell.<br />If you've never been in a battering relationship, you could never understand why someone would stay around and get beaten up day after day, this film will show you. The battering is mutual and invariably followed by bizarre moments of closeness, apology and even tenderness. In emotionally impoverished and dysfunctional families, this is as good as you get, so you go for it.<br />In this sensitive portrayal, the protagonist professor of piano technique, Erika, breaks though her deeply repressed sexuality and attempts to experience love for the first time with one of her students. Attempting to work out her internal conflicts, the love should be expressed alternately in sadism (she's gratuitously mean to all her students) or in masochism (what she demands of her lover is pain and humiliation). Since the object of her desire, Walter, is not only attracive and talented, but also seems to care deeply for her, the agony of this movie is much deeper.<br />As to the film itself, at times it moves slowly. But you need the break to recover from the intensity of the major scenes. The performances of piano and vocal music are paradoxically delightful to hear, and this movie should win an Oscar for \\"best sound\\" (every creak of a floor board counts).<br />This is a remarkable movie that should be taken seriously and will reward a mature approach.
0930289528|4.0|That somebody could write a tale like this as a graphic novel is ineffect a bewildering achievement. George Orwell, 1984 and all that. Well, the old man would have been proud of an accomplishment like this himself. Alan Moore's obvious talent, if it was ever in doubt that is, shines through in this awesome piece of work.
B000005IU2|5.0|Whereas The Stooges' first album was essentially the sound of anti-social outsiders playing the crudest garage rock possible, endlessly repeating the same brutal, pounding blues riffs until they achieved a hypnotic sense of rhythm over which the guitar shrieked and vocalist Iggy Pop sang urban tales predating the rise of punk, its follow-up, \\"Fun House\\" expanded the blueprint and pushed the limits of what primal rock 'n' roll could be to the extreme. Beating their inspiration, the Velvet Underground's seminal \\"White Light/White Heat\\" at its own game (though through somewhat different means), they recorded what is inarguably one of the most intense albums ever created, finding the musical equivalent of the most unrestrained, anarchic party any man could ever conceive - simultaneously horrifying and fascinating in its thoroughly savage abandon. On the group's debut, Iggy Pop was a more confrontational singer than any of his time, but here he is positively seething, as if in the midst of a tribal trance which demanded complete submission of body, mind and soul. He alternates between a sneering, more familiar vocal style reminiscent of Mick Jagger's cocksure arrogance, and purely primitive yells which convey the point of his sonic accompaniment perfectly.<br />The lyrics complement the music perfectly, as Iggy bellows out lines like \\"I'll stick it deep inside\\" (never directly mentioning what 'it' is) and \\"I came to play and I mean to play real good\\". Clearly, this isn't poetry to be analyzed at the same level of seriousness one would tackle Dylan lyrics with, but nothing could ever be more appropriate in the heat of the moment than the litany \\"I feel alright\\" during the incendiary ending of \\"1970\\".<br />Naming highlights is an exercise in futility as the record maintains a stunning consistence from beginning to end (something which wasn't exactly true of their debut). The sequencing is wonderful as well, creating the impression of a \\"highway to Hell\\" better than AC/DC ever could, as the record is front-loaded with the more straight-ahead garage rockers \\"Down on the Street\\", \\"Loose\\" and \\"T.V. Eye\\" (though even these get progressively wilder and wilder), and then slowly descends into free-form improvisation taking its cues directly from the then-contemporary avant-garde jazz scene (and even employing a tenor sax for full effect) before climaxing with the apocalypse: \\"L.A. Blues\\", practically 5 minutes of jarring, directionless noise which epitomizes the album's manifesto. The Stooges are often criticized for playing so-called \\"stupid music\\", but these last three tracks completely shatter the myth. No, this isn't the equivalent of Anthony Braxton or late-era John Coltrane, but its manic intensity and jazz-inspired complete disregard of a \\"verse-chorus-verse\\" pattern certainly comes very close, and would likely put off most listeners - music this unpredictable and inaccessible is definitely not \\"stupid\\". Iggy himself explains his reliance on garage rock in the liner notes for the reissue of the group's subsequent album, \\"Raw Power\\", \\"I had very sophisticated taste but my skills were very simple and the skills of the guys in the band were even more simple than mine\\". <br />Only a single moment of respite is to be found, in the form of the slow, bluesy \\"Dirt\\", where the band locks in an elastic groove that simply won't let go and Iggy intones one of his best, most compelling vocal performances. Apparently, he felt that every record requires at least one ballad, and though the song's sinister sexiness has little to do with the traditional meaning one gives to the word, there was little that was traditional about the Stooges after all.<br />It is very likely that \\"Fun House\\" may strike you as a powerful, yet somewhat off-putting album the first time you hear it (especially its final songs), but at some point, the right mood will kick in and you will never look back. Recommended for alley fights, binge drinking, shootin' heroin, other 'repetitive' actions or simply wearing a leather jacket and thinking you're the coolest bastard around. And even when the thrill is gone and you're spent, all you have to do is push \\"play\\" and go at it again.
B00005JKG9|5.0|Coffee's for closers.  <br />This is a GREAT movie.  Jack Lemmon's Shelly Levine is a modern day Willie Loman.  This is one of the rare Hollywood films that actually respects the spoken word.  Mamet has a unique style and it really translates well in this screenplay.  I love Mamet's stuff and this adaptation of what is probably his best work is just fantastic.  The cast is ridiculously good and Alec Baldwin gives one of his best performances in a minor role that Mamet created specifically for this screenplay.<br />I could watch this every night and not tire of it.
B00006LFGD|2.0|As part of her 40th Anniversary with Columbia Records, both the singer and the studio has decided to release yet ANOTHER compilation of previously released material; this one just a scant ten months after releasing &quot;The Essential Barbra Streisand&quot;, where most of these songs can be found. <br />At least they fit better on &quot;the Essential&quot; collection, because it was Barbra at her best - with Neil Diamond, Barry Gibb, and Donna Summer (admittedly, Columbia went a bit 'duet crazy' in the late 70s-early 80s, after her success with Diamond in 1978). What &quot;Duets&quot; includes, but &quot;Essential&quot; wisely omitted, are her mis-steps in the '70s and '80s (with Kris Kristofferson, Kim Carnes and Don Johnson), and her mis-matches in the 90s (with Sinatra- who was not at HIS best in '93, and the light-weight Michael Crawford). Her duets with Barry Manilow and Josh Groban are - in a word - unnecessary. Both of these could have been replaced by her better 'duets' with Louis Armstrong (1969s &quot;Hello, Dolly!&quot;) and Omar Shariff (1968s &quot;You AreWoman/I Am Man&quot;). Some of the rumored 'vaulted' duets with Mandy Patinkin (said to be dropped from 83's &quot;YENTL&quot;) and Olivia Newton-John, or Dionne Warwick (both allegedly recorded for, yet dropped from, 85's &quot;The Broadway Album&quot;) might have been a real treat for fans.<br />Let's hope, for her fans sake, that Columbia sends Streisand back to the studio for new recordings for the next ten years, before we are served another dish of yesteryear's luke-warm left-overs to celebrate her Golden Anniversary. Till then, in the words of Streisand and Summer - &quot;ENOUGH IS ENOUGH&quot;!
B00006CXSS|5.0|If you want the whole story of Easy Company read the official unit histories, but if you want an emotional and pretty accurate telling of that unit's experience from training in 1943 until it's last action at the end of the war this is great storytelling.<br />It has the look and feel of &quot;Saving Private Ryan&quot; for obvious reasons (i.e. Hanks/Speilberg).  At times it has an almost documentary feel to it and I think that helped the series a lot.  The uniforms, weapons and gear are all pretty accurate.  There were a few things pictured in the movie that simply never happened or never would have happened (i.e. all of the guys huddled around the jeep singing songs after they take the town of of Foy - - I read an interview with Carwood Lipton (the Donnie Walberg character - - sadly he passed away shortly after the series was released) and he said it was the most glaringly inaccurate scene in the series), but the serious on the whole &quot;gets it right&quot; far more often that not. Even the casting was well done - - the actors all resemble the actual guys they portray circa 1943-45.  The history here is the real drama -- there's no need for phono BS Hollywood add-ons . . . the story of these men and what they did is incredible enough.<br />Stephen Ambrose borrowed heavily from some earlier works that detailed this unit's history and it's combat record in the war when he wrote the book and the surviving members of Easy Company held him to a pretty high standard as far as getting the story right so the history is all there.  The series is a pretty good condensation of the book as well - - probably about as good a job as anybody could have done in turning a book into a mini-series.<br />There were lots of combat units that endured the same sorts of hardships and made the same sacrafices as these men, but the story of the 101st Airborne, 506th PIR, 2d Battallion, Easy Company is a great microcosm of the whole story of the war on the Western front in Europe.<br />Truly a great series worthy of all the acclaim in received.
6305807086|1.0|This movie initially demonstrates a great deal of promise.  I was very excited to see it, I had heard great things about the movie's creative premise.  This is a great movie for people who aren't offended by husbands locking up their wives while they go to pursue other women. I believe John Cusak's character locks his wife up in an animal cage (twice) and binds her up with duct tape.  Another distinctive memory is the creative puppeteer making lewd public display (on a sidewalk) of lust between a nun and a priest.  I guess it's not for the religiously sensitive either.  As an aside, the wife eventully \\"comes around\\" and begins to lust after the same woman as her husband.  I'm sure I'm leaving out a lot of details from this dark, morally stunted movie.  However, it's been a long time since I've seen it and I will NOT be exposing my mind to this movie again.
B00005JL8C|5.0|Many people have already written down the plot of this movie. many people understood the plot of the movie. Many people didn't understand the plot of this movie. <BR>This is a hell of a ride. With every next scene you are scared what will be next. But you want, NO you need to see it. Isabella Huppert is amazing and probably has givin the performance of the year. All the acting in this movie is magnificent. Many of the american reviewers don't seem to understand the bigger picture, as if sexual violence is of a worse kind then plain killing with a gun and shooting people in the streets. Knowing how puritan USA is as a country I believe that many people have difficulties seeing al the layers in this movie. There are so many, watch it again and maybe you will see the true art in this film.
B000001FZK|5.0|Want something jazzy. Want something noisy. Want something sad. Want something oddly joyous. Buy this record. Life in a nutshell. I've listened to this record in the USA, in Europe, and in Africa. I've taken it everywhere and it has always been enjoyed. Buy it and hit the road.
0679721037|4.0|On August 6, 1945 a noiseless flash of the first atomic bombing spread out into the early morning sky of Hiroshima.  This is the story of six surviors of the diaster.  With no detail held back, John Hersey has written an excellent novel that should be read by everyone.  It is written as the surviors of the destruction of Hiroshima excatly remember it. This book tells of the horrors these people had to endure.  Even though all these people witnessed the same thing, they all have many different points of view about what happened on that fateful day.  A masterpiece of literature, this book should and must be read by everyone.
B00005N5S5|5.0|They had little or no budget. An untested director, James Cameron. An unknown cast. And an impossible task... create a believeable science fiction movie in the age of &quot;Star Wars&quot; type special effects.<br />They pulled it all off with this film. It is at times tense, funny and above all exciting. Before you see T3, be sure you see where it all began. T2 is great, but T1 is nothing short of astounding.
B00006AG5N|5.0|This has to been the longest cd with songs recorded by Elvis Presley. This cd runs 79 minutes and 34 secends. This cd has both Elvis Presley's famous songs and some they you may have either never heard of before, or never heard Elvis Presley sings. The famous ones include Heartbreak Hotel, Don't Be Cruel, Hound Dog, Love Me Tender, too much, all shook up. And the songs that rarely ever appear on Elvis cds (released by RCA) include Crying in the Chapel, Wooden Heart, (now and then there's) a fool such as I, and (marie's the name) his lastest flame. <br />My thoughts on 30 #1 hits. First I have to say that they are 2 songs that took 5 ot more years to be released. First Crying the Chapel, Elvis Presley recoreded this song on 10/31/60 and was finnaly released on 4/24/65. The 2nd is the bonus track was releashed last 6/25/02. Almost 25 years after Elvis Presley's death. Now if it was releashed between 8/16/02/ and 1/1/03, it would have been 25 years. It is hard to believe that if Elvis was still alive, he would have been 68 years old this year.
B000069AT7|5.0|The new spiffed-up version of E.T. is like a coat of wax on a classic automobile. It just makes what's already there look a little nicer.<BR>OK...'way nicer. This DVD looks crisp and fresh, with bright colors and gobs of detail.<BR>E.T. was the pre-eminent filmgoing event for a generation, the group after &quot;Star Wars&quot;. <BR>And with good reason. It's a perfect film.  It hasn't aged a bit. Or I should say it's aging ridiculously well. Or is it &quot;ageless&quot;?  Whatever. You get the point.<BR>In fifty years, this film will be as beloved as &quot;The Wizard of Oz&quot;...or as any Disney flick...<BR>Henry Thomas puts on a performance that ranks with ANY ever delivered by a child actor, and it is his believability that make ET real to US.

B00003CXZ4|5.0|I'm not a fan of violent movies, but this is beautiful and brilliant. It's also very well acted.
0156421178|5.0|I picked up Homage to Catalonia on a whim.  I am glad I did.  Orwell writes in magnificent prose his experiences as an idealistic young man taking up arms to fight the spread of fascism.  It concludes with a disillusioned, near mortally wounded (but still idealistic) Orwell  fleeing the country for his life -  a wanted criminal in the land he fought and bled to save.  While he spent only a few months in Spain, but his vivid descriptions of the personalities he met, the hardship he endured and the near-fatal gunshot wound he received clearly impacted him in a profound way.  His account will similarly impact the reader.<br />Homage to Catalonia is really two books - one is the graphic retelling of Orwell's daily existence with the POUM (a Marxist group of revolutionaries), his impressions of his fellow militia-men, the privations they suffered, and the combat that they hardly ever saw.  The other is Orwell's first-hand account of the politics &quot;behind the scenes&quot;; the Machiavellian plotting and schemeing between various revolutionary groups, the half-truths (and outright fabrications) of the media, the jockeying of politicians and nations in what would become the &quot;dress rehearsal&quot; for the Second World War.  Much to my amusement, Orwell realizes he is writing two books, and point-blank invites the reader to &quot;skip&quot; the political analysis and get to the &quot;good stuff&quot; if the reader so wishes.<br />In either case, Orwell wrote a tragedy.  A tragedy that Spain had to suffer as it did.  And that such noble ideas (as those Orwell himself fought for) were eventually washed away with Great Power &quot;realpolitik.&quot; The book was written while the civil war was still playing itself out;  I beleive Orwell saw the writing on the wall.  Highly recommeded reading.
0385508417|4.0|I really enjoyed how Grisham exposed the peer pressure, greed and insanity of the holiday season through the grumpy eyes of his protagonist. The people were caricatures for most of the book, but the ending provided a whole Christmas season's worth of depth and warmth. If you're sick of the whole commercial Christmas thing, this book will validate you AND warm your heart.
0812550706|4.0|Ender's Game is a book that can be read every year and each time find new meaning.  The story focuses on a young boy named Andrew (Ender) through out his training to become a military leader in the war against the alien buggers.  For years the government has been trying to create the perfect military leader.  Ender's brother, Peter, and sister, Valentine, were both thought to be that commander, but Peter was too aggressive, and Valentine too passive.  Ender is considered the worlds only hope of winning the upcoming war.  Two men discussing Ender and the progress he has been making precede each chapter.  They decide to manipulate Ender's surrounding in order to mold him into the military leader they want him to be.  When Ender becomes skilled enough to be a commander, he made to believe that he only is practicing an attack when in reality he is leading an army against the real buggers.  Ender realizes that the only way to beat what he thinks is a game is to attack the bugger's planet and kill billions of innocent buggers.  When he is told that the program was in fact a real attack and he just won the war, Ender feels guilty for the death of billions.  This book is recommended for a science fiction reader of any age.  Full of memorable characters and a lot of action, Ender's Game leaves the readers asking themselves this question:  is the manipulation of one life worth the lives of many?
0140135154|5.0|This book has the potential to completely re-shift your understanding of art.  It is about art philosophy, but much more than that, how we understand the nature of art, and how it relates to our cultures and societies.  It is a book designed for the general reader, without a large art background, but also appreciable by the artist and the professional art critic.<br />People often look down upon the objectification of women in advertising, and how we regularly degrade women for the pleasure of a few, treating women as objects or bodies only.  But then we look back on the nudes of the Renaissance or other periods and think, how beautifully made!  This is truly art, after all, and not the same moral level as an underwear ad or porn.  Berger destroys these myths.  Yes, Rembrandt's nudes are much more artistically done than anything in advertising, but Berger shows a convincing link between the treatment of women in art of that time and art of this time.  If one expands the definition of art in the modern period, the similarities are extraordinary.  In Ways of Seeing Berger carefully traces how art has been used as a method of control, in general and towards women in particular.  How those beautiful nudes we now see in museums were usually in wealthy men's private collections where only they could observe them- much as Playboy is today.  How even the medium (oil, watercolor, film) changes the way information is forced upon us and control is asserted.  Berger does this all not only through text but showing the actual paintings and pictures- indeed, over half the book is art of various sorts.  It is illuminating to see an ad that obviously objectifies women, and then to see the exact same picture next to it, but of a famous oil painting that the ad was based on.  I first read this work over a decade ago and it's ideas and images have never left me.  Nor will they leave you.
0060989157|5.0|Without a doubt, this is the greatest rock n roll autobiography ever written. The thing that permiates this book throughout is the brutal honesty. I had a terribly hard time putting it down and actually didn't want it to end, it is such a page turner. The Motley boys come across as slimy, selfish, rude, unlikable, sympathetic, introspective, blunt and very likable! Everyone involved with the Crue gets their say from bandmembers, ex bandmembers, managers and ex managers, producers, record company execs etc. What's so important to remember prior to purchasing this book is, unlike other music oriented books, this book does not hold the band up to be role models or pillars of society. This book lays out for all the see, the sheer unadulterated dirt. A+++
B000005RT8|3.0|If you're looking into purchasing McCartney II, expect experimental electronic grooves intertwined with McCartney's writing.<br />The opening track, \\"Coming Up\\" is the big hit of the album, but it is the live version that is not only the more well known, but better of the two.  The other highlights of the set include \\"Temporary Secretary\\" (Paul at his most sexist), \\"On The Way\\", \\"Waterfalls\\", \\"Darkroom\\" and \\"One of These Days\\".<br />\\"Waterfalls\\" and \\"One of These Days\\" are really the only \\"conventional\\" sounding songs on here.<br />The album's filler includes the hit single \\"Goodnight Tonight\\" released the year before, which fits very well with the other material (even though it is technically a Wings track), as well as a couple of leftovers from the McCartney II sessions.<br />Bottom Line: This album is remenicent to McCartney's debut album in the fact that it is just him in the studio messing around (this time with electronic gadgets and dance rhythms) - though not as good as many other McCartney outings, it is a very interesting listen.
0743455967|4.0|This is the only book of Stephen King's I have been able to read cover to cover. I find his subject matter generally difficult to stomach. However, on a long camping trip last summer I picked it up at the general store to have something to read. I am a writer myself, and this book increased my admiration of Mr. King's great imagination and writing ability. (Yes, I do admire him for that, I just dislike his choice of subject matter at times.) The book is absolutely inspiring! It's not a textbook on how to become a writer, but it is very helpful. Instruction is broken up by entertaining anecdotes. It is a very insightful look into the minds of one of America's most successful contemporary fiction writers. I recommend it for any writer or fan of Stephen King's.
B00000J7SS|4.0|This is the musical Hugh Selwyn Mauberley. Juxtaposition with notes. Not many people realize that much of this music was made through tape splicing and edits. This was not a real time performance. If this resulted from real time performance I'd give it a couple of stars since it isn't really musical in that realm. As it stands though, as a studio album, I give it five stars due to the remarkable reconstruction of the themes, colors, and all those other buzz words. It pains me to not listen to this, though, since I like most of Miles' music, but let's face it: this is not listenable. My hypothesis is that people like this album because it is different and, more than likely, it is there first encounter with group improvisation -- similar situation with Ornette's Free Jazz. This may well be the credit card of cool that allows you to take stock in other cool albums, but personally I'll take other free jazz albums -- Jarrett's Inside Out and Holland's Conference of Birds (both sidemen of Miles sometime or another) over this any day. If you want a real time version of this album try Live at Fillmore (March 7) because it is the actual live realization of what this collage piece attemepted. Important vision, artwork on this album though.
0446608955|4.0|I read this book in one night!  It's pretty short (200+ pages, but they're small and the print is big).  After seeing the movie, which was disapointing, I wanted to read the book.  The book is way better, especially since it takes place in 1957.  The movie's main problem was in trying to set a 50's book in a 90's setting without updating critical aspects.  The book is  sweet, but not overly so.  I think it helps that it's told from Landon's point-of-view.  Also, Jamie and Landon spend so much time together before there relationship finally changes.  It creates great tension.  There's also so much detail in the relationships in Landon's friends and family that's missing in the movie.  It makes the book much richer.  Overall, it has several important messages and tells a touching and real story.
0440211727|4.0|John Grisham was born in Arkansas in 1955.  He grew up to be a lawyer in a small Missippi town.  His writing of legal dramas began after hearing the testimony of a 12-year-old rape victim, which inspired his first novel A Time to Kill.<BR>   In A Time to Kill a southern black man is on trial facing the death penalty for the murder of the two white men who brutally raped his young daughter.  Now his lawer, Jack Brigance, is faced with the challenge of freeing him along with all of the social problems that came with it.<BR>  In the novel Grisham thoroughly depicts the life and social staus of a small southern town.  The reader is able to feel the racial tension and the fear spread throughout the town as problems begin to arise.  The strong personalities of his characters develop with the story and give you a personal feel for their situation.  To not root for their defense would be impossible.  <BR>   Grisham is able to find the balance of being descriptive without being too wordy and thorough wihtout becoming boring.  A Time to Kill is realistic, exciting, and suspenceful, keeping you interested the whole way.  One of the greatest of his books, I would recommend it to anyone with interest in this genre.
B00005YW4H|5.0|I received this as a gift and am very happy with it. I am a fan of jazz and easy listening,and this fits the bill.  Its soothing sounds, and relaxing melodies will repeat themselves in your head when the CD is not even on!  Her voice is pure magic.<br />Norah Jones does an awesome job with vocals and piano, Lee Alexander is great on Bass, and Adam Levy's electric guitar is just superb!  <br />This is 45 minutes of pure enjoyment, and the best part is having it over and over again.  With 14 tracks, you really get a fine sample of what this up and coming artist has to offer.
B00005V3Z4|3.0|up until the end, this film is fascinating, creative, and complex...<br />...and then the end hits and you're left to wonder what, out of everything in the movie, actually ends up being real.<br />i've been surprised that so few people question what happens to the Patrick Swayze character after the end.  (oh, but HUGE kudos to Swayze for taking on the role he did.)  there is so much that happens in the film which the ending just literally unravels.  it definitely leaves you with questions about what is reality, and what is reality worth...
B00005JL96|5.0|This may be the finest film that Disney has released in decades.  A true treasure, and not as treacly as other Disney fare.
0385335482|5.0|I laughed most of the way through this book.  I'm a bit of a shopaholic myself (but not as bad as the main character) so I could relate to some of the things in the book.  I've already ordered &quot;Shopaholic Takes Manhattan&quot;.

0743455967|4.0|I'm not a big Stephen King fan - haven't read any of his books since middle school - but I found this really refreshing. His bio (the first half) dragged on a bit, but would probably be really interesting for fans. The second half - when he talks about the writing process - had some good tips, different from those I've read in other how-to writing books. Tips about where to write and how to approach the craft of storytelling that I actually have found useful. He uses frank language and a conversational style and it is a relatively quick read. Mostly relevant for fiction writers, but others might find it useful, too.
B00006IUL7|3.0|Christopher Nolan is a talented director, no doubt. His previous film \\"Memento\\" is proof of that.  This film is proof as well, although it clearly shows the hallmarks of a Hollywood production: it proceeds cautiously and with great skill, but it feels like chartered territory: the villian (played with aplomb by Robin Williams) has to explain his motivations, thereby robbing the film of a little mystery, and the films ends in a way that is too rudimentary, too conventional for a film of this caliber. Ultimately, these flaws (and a few others) make \\"Insomnia\\" less satisfying than it could be. The fault is not necessarily Mr. Nolan's; it could very well lie with the screenwriter or, what is more likely, with the producers and the distributor. When \\"foreign\\" filmmakers come to Hollywood (Nolan is British), they are often \\"forced\\" to make more conventional films.<br />But even with its conventional elements, \\"Insomnia\\" is about as skillful in its execution as a film can be.  It's tense and captivating, and the performances all around are praiseworthy.  Pacino gives all the hot-blooded gusto we normally associate with him, but it's toned down successfully, which helps to strengthen the heaviness and lingering exhaustion that the murder investigation (which is the film's subject) entails. The setting is perfect: Nolan takes the Alaskan climate and washes it beautifully with gray, blue, white, and green hues, with a never-ending, penetrating, suffusing light that renders Pacino an insomniac and that gives weight to the film's central themes. It's highly intelligent without being emotionally empty. Nolan understands nuance, and he has an uncanny ability to make the best out of his material.<br />I cannot rate this film too highly because I felt it ultimately underwhelms with its conventions, but, by the same token, I will admit that I was taken aback by the ardor, skill, and technical assurance with which Nolan tells this story. Few films tie the strands together as well asthis one does; even fewer match the visual language as precisely to the subject matter.  It's an achievement, even if I kept feeling, particularly at the end of the film, that I've seen it before, only because Hollywood is better at repackaging the same elements instead of originating new ones.<br />On the DVD itself: a good transfer, with a crips image and sound. Particularly appealing is a special feature in which Nolan discusses the film in the sequence in which it was shot -- now there is something original!
0316666343|5.0|I bought this book awhile ago, but put off reading it as the subject matter of the first chapter was chilling.  I am glad I perservered.  The characters are well drawn, and you can relate to the family as they move through their grief.  Once I did start, I couldn't put it down, and I missed the Salmon family when I finished.  I rarely read books twice, but may make an exception in this case.
B00003CXFG|5.0|This movie was entertaining to watch with its suspense, diverse character study, unpredictable plot turns, and not to mention the scary sequences. This movie did a good job in making these creatures be seen as terrifying. All these beings wanted to do was eat their human pray and no child or women was spared which makes the creature from \\"Alien\\" look tame compared to these carnivores. The story line on Pitch black was that the a crew was forced to make an emergency crash landing on this deadly planet shortly before the time this planet had a 3 sun solar eclipse to the moon. As a result, the entire planet goes dark indefinantly and these fierce creatures come flying out of the ground like locusts infesting the entire planet.<BR>Vin Diesel of course was the unofficial hero in this film although his character portrayal was not one of a typical good hearted empathitic  hero. Rather he was a melicious murderer held captive on this ship by  a police figure who also had bad intentions but, I won't get into that, you gotta see it for yourself. Coincedentally, Vin's character has abnormal eye sight which allows him to see in the dark therefore,  the crew members feeling helpless against these deadly creatures are forced to rely on Vin's night vision for thier survival. Vin's character however, has other ideas which is to sacrifies the crews lives to these creatures to ensure his own escape. I won't give away how things end up but, I'll just say that it is slightly unpredictable and action packed along the way. Even these aliens fall victim to Vin's bad azz gung ho approach. Great sci fi flick that isn't for everybodies taste but, if you like the sci fi thriller genre, definantly take a look at this film.
0345440900|5.0|We've loved this book. As with everything, we take her advice with a grain of salt. We know that works for one will not work for all. In our case, the majority of tips and advice in this book have worked. She's thoughtful, compassionate, loving and wise. She thinks of not only what's best for the child but also what's best for the parents. (Which is a no brainer-since if the parents aren't happy the baby won't be either!)<br />We highly recommend this book. It's been a lifesaver.
0385503954|5.0|As one who cannot stand the flood of plotless books looking so deeply inside their character's souls (thanks a lot Oprah) I had to be shoved into reading \\"Atonement\\".  What a wonderful surprise. Easily the best piece of fiction I've read in years.<br />The story is about atonement for a terrible lie (did the liar know she was a liar?) told at a family gathering at an English manor in 1935. The effect of that lie on the lives of those she most loved and most hurt is followed through the English retreat at Dunkirk, and at an English hospital on the eve the great blitz.  The story ends at the same manor in 1999.<br />The author takes the reader deep inside his three main characters and yet weaves a story well worth the rapid turning of pages. It's as if Joyce merged with Forsythe, incredible understanding of what it is to be human meets brilliant storytelling.  I cared tremendously for each character, understood their pain, felt their joy, and I just loved the tragic but honest resolution. <br />I waited a week to write this review to see if the book \\"stays with you\\", it does.  Ian McEwan is a genius.

0060278269|5.0|I teach 7th grade English and Sabriel was first introduced to me in a book report three years ago.  I didn't pick it up until a while later, and I instantly fell in love.  Lirael was even better and I've been eagerly awaiting Abhorsen for what feels like forever.<br />Abhorsen picks up right where Lirael left off.  Lirael and Sameth are fighting Chlorr of the Mask and tragedy has come to King Touchstone and the Queen and Abhorsen Sabriel.  The opening chapter stops your heart and the pace flies right until the final words.  <br />I highly recommend this series for adolescent girls.  Sabriel and Lirael are two of the most amazing young women to be found in young adult literature.  I have a circle of girls who have been passing these books around and almost lost their minds when I managed to get an advance copy of Abhorsen for them to review.  The boys like the story, too, so if you're looking for a gift, pick up these three books.<br />Wow.  Rarely do I feel so satisfied with a book.  If you're in sixth grade or any age above, get these books!
B000069AT7|5.0|I absolutely adore ET. I saw it at the movies when I was 5 and have been in love ever since. So now that I have  a daugter of my own you can imagine my joy at being able to share a piece of movie magic from my childhood with her. I recieved this as a Xmas present and was delighted to find all the extras. I was only planning on purchasing the DVD for myself. The set is definitely worth it. It contains the original release of the movie and the updated, enhanced version. The book is absolutely delightful. There are so many facts about the flick that I learned from how ET is made to commentary from Steven Spielberg and the script with various comments in the margin. My daughter is too young to actually watch and understand the movie but she does listen to the CD. (She loves music from Mozart to Celine Dion to Enya to Lenny Kravitz.) The third DVD with extras about the movie I have yet to watch but if it follows the pattern of this set it should definitely be interesting. All of this is packaged beautifully for keeping. I couldn't have recieved a better present and will keep it for my daughter who hopefully will uncover the magic this classic has to offer just as I did.
0425170349|5.0|I recently read this book while I was serving in Afghanistan for Operation Enduring Freedom.  Since there was not much in the way of television, I had to read on my spare time.  I am a huge fan of Tom Clancy's work, and his Jack Ryan series, but I must say, that John Clark is by far the better hero.  If one were to read \\"Without Remorse\\", it is clear why I think this.  John Kelly is a real person with real demons, and his character fascinates me.  I wish Tom Clancy would write more books with him in the title role.  I must say that this book scared me to death.  His tales of extremists in the \\"nature loving\\" world are very real.  Nobody can deny this, with all the extremists in the world, it does not seem very far-fetched.  In addition, the way Clark deals with these extremists in the end is the best kind of karma.  Sheer perfection.  The only disappointment I had was that, while Clark was the title character, he really was not a main character until the end.  This book seemed to be more about Chavez than Clark.  \\"Without Remorse\\" is still my favorite book, but Clark appears in a handful of other books by Clancy.  The Amazon.com editor nails it with his \\"Clark is Ryan's shadow double\\" statement.  He is an intense character, and I really hope that a movie is made about this book, or \\"Without Remorse\\" soon.  However, I will not hold my breath
B000066NW0|4.0|I liked most of the songs on he cd and I won't diss her on how her voice sounds or her music... She thinks her music is totally ...punk rock music and she claims that her songs are not sappy and stuff when they kinda are...but she does play a little guatar...but she is not a punk ... like she trys to m,ake her image like. I think more people wouldn't diss her if she advertized her music for what it really is. I liked her songs \\"complicated\\" \\"sk8r boi\\" \\"nobodys fool\\" and \\"things i'll never say\\". I like them for their more slow beat then what i uasually lisen to.
B000002BBY|5.0|Noel Gallagher is a genius at writing big, grandiose, sweeping songs. &quot;....Morning Glory&quot; is filled to the brim with catchy, beautiful songs that come dangerously close to being overblown but always stay close to home and succeed at being intimate and warm. &quot;She's Electric&quot; is a prime example of this approach as is &quot;Cast No Shadow&quot; and the gorgeous, banging &quot;Hey Now&quot;, all songs sporting indelible hooks and grand, spacious arrangements. My personal favorite here is the astounding &quot;Wonderwall&quot; which never fails to drive me to tears with it's heavy orchestral backing, great rhythm playing and the whining, angry, petulant drawl of Liam Gallagher's lead vocal. Isn't it cool the way he actually conducts the band with his voice (when he sings the line &quot;back-beat, the word is on the street that the fire in your heart is out&quot;..the backbeat, the strings, bass and drums come in 2 beats later!)and sets the tone for the entire piece? Taken song for song, &quot;....Morning Glory&quot; is stronger than any other Oasis LP, and as suite it's nearly flawless. A Classic that cements their status as giants in British Rock.

6304211740|3.0|Having seen two other versions of \\"Jane\\" (BBC version and Wells/Fontaine), this version was okay but it could have been better. I thought Gainbourgh/Hurt looked interesting together as Jane and Mr. Rochester . . . and Anna Paquian who plays young \\"Jane Eyre\\" delivered a solid performance. (you may remember her in \\"The Piano\\", \\"Finding Forrester\\" and \\"The X-Men\\")<BR>The problem was most of the story was not at all faithful to the novel. Several times I found myself saying \\"that scene wasn't in the book\\" or \\"she never said that\\" (e.g. Jane, upon hearing of her fortune, said, \\"I will give part of my inheritance to the Lowood School\\"--did she really?! That was one of MANY \\"artistic changes\\" to the story) . . . At best, the movie felt more like an adaptation of the Wells/Fontaine version of \\"Jane\\" than an interpretation of Charlotte Bronte's novel . . . <BR>If you're a fan of William Hurt (LOVE him), buy (or rent) \\"The Accidental Tourist\\" or \\"Children of a Lesser God\\". Although he played an \\"okay\\" Mr. Rochester (angst and all), I thought he was short changed in this vehicle.<BR>As a whole, this adaptations was pretty to look at, had some interesting bits here and there, but fell short of the novel. The musical score was beautiful . . .
1572700033|4.0|My name is Steve and I go to St. Pius School in Lombard Illinois, and i had to read Hiroshima for a literature class.  This book is a diffacult read, but it is very enjoyable.  The story starts off in Hiroshima when the bomb drops.  Hersey writes about six people in the town when the bomb dropped and follows what they do through the entire book.  I liked the idea of starting off the book with a big event.  Most books lead up to the climax, but Hersey decided to take a chance and make the climax right at the beginning.  I think that the chance he took made the book very enjoyable.  This book is very descriptive and Hersy is does not leave very much to the imagination.  Another thing about the book is that it is sort of divided into two sections: when the bomb dropped and all of the events that followed, and fifty years later.  I thought that this idea was very neat.  Also what made the book even better was that all the characters were real and Hersy tracked down their lives for fifty years just to write this book.  The only down-side to the book was that it was a rather challenging book.  Many times I had to re-read many paragraphs.  Besides that I really enjoyed the book and I hope that you will to!
B00000DQSS|4.0|\\"Never For Ever\\" was Kate Bush's third album, after [[ASIN:B000006U44 The Kick Inside]] and [[ASIN:B000007MVL Lionheart]], both of which were afflicted by wafer-thin late 70s production which destroyed her already apparent mystical depth. On \\"Never For Ever\\", Kate moved away from Andrew Powell, who produced her first two albums, and co-produced with Jon Kelly.<br /><br />The results of this effort were somewhat varied but worthwhile. The opener, \\"Babooshka\\", gave her a huge hit in Australia with a simple pop tune, and \\"The Wedding List\\" and the hot rocker \\"Violin\\" were similar in tone: simple rockers driven largely by guitars, bass and drums - though even here occassional odd flourishes added interest to the songs, such as the barely audible harmonica on \\"The Wedding List\\". All these songs certainly benefit from a rather thicker (though still not ideal) production, but the late 70s atmosphere was not suited to Bush's deeply feminine character. \\"Breathing\\", however, was somewhat overdone with guitar lines and Roy Harper's backing vocals that removed much of the song's beautiful melody.<br /><br />The rest of \\"Never For Ever\\", though, was much less accessible, with \\"Delius (Song Of Summer)\\" moving away from the pure pop of \\"Babooshka\\" to a Cocteau Twins-like dreamscape. \\"Egypt\\" possessed an outro that showed the direction Kate was headed in on her following albums, whilst \\"All We Ever Look For\\" was slow and challenging, but ultimately beautiful with Kate singing one of her most melodic vocals. \\"Blow Away (For Bill)\\" was a oddly mature tale about the casualties of the music business, whilst \\"The Infant Kiss\\" solidified her early piano-based style into a lovely string-driven ballad, and \\"Army Dreamers\\" was a simple but effective tale of a soldier's death. The album was filled out with the a capella \\"Night Scented Stock\\", a short but coldly beautiful piece that showed Kate in a light most would never hear.<br /><br />Though hugely successful in Britain and Australia, \\"Never For Ever\\" gained no exposure in America and never dented the Top 200. It does stand as a more developed performance by a woman who was to produce the most well-though and brilliant tales of spiritual wisdom in rock history later in the decade.ver For Ever\\" gained no exposure in America and never dented the Top 200.

0553381709|5.0|George RR Martin's website states that this story will run at least 6 volumes. I hate to say it, but I can't wait to read each and every one of them. I know that I join many other readers when I say that the first 3 installments have been gripping and exceptionally well written. I just hope that the storyline doesn't decline into another &quot;Wheel of Time&quot; debacle.<BR>The story itself grows more epic in scale with each chapter and quickly reminds the reader why he or she loves fantasy fiction. Martin has kept the use of magic to a minimum and the story is tremendously better for it. Magic exists, but the story is not driven by wizards and warlocks. The characters resound with realism and the plot takes them places you would never expect.<br />An excellent story told in 3 books so far. Martin's website says (as of today) that he is still writing Book IV. I feel like a kid in a toy store. I can't wait to get my hands on it.
B00005JK8K|2.0|There is only two suggestions to the director of the movie: 1) Stop using the SLOW-MOTION again, will you?! It's so bothering and disturbing just as the non-stop, totally unrelated background music  playing on with those movies. 2) Is there any way that you could direct any movie that wouldn't have to waste so much dynamite and so many explosions?  By watching the movies that you directed I only found out that there is no progress or improvment in the directing so far since those HongKong days but over-used old old montage techniques. The slow-motion frames on the screen and those explosions are only proofs that how bad a director would be and could reach. The costs of dynamite and stuntmen could be better used in making a better movie with better script and better casting. This time, there is no generation gap between me and my 25 & 15 years old sons, We all agreed that this movie ... big time.
0375703861|4.0|This is a multi-layered, multi-cultural novel about the lives of a couple of seemingly opposite friends and their families, spanning from the end of World War II to the nineties.<br />Archie is a native Brit with a Jamaican wife and a stubbornly independent daughter.  Samad (or Sam, as Archie calls him) is a Bangladeshi immigrant trying to make a good (and properly Muslim) life for his wife and twin sons in England.  The story winds its way through their friendship from its odd beginning during the war, through the complicated events that befall their children and finishes with a bang-up ending that ties all loose ends neatly together, in the manner of Tom Wolfe.<br />Smith succeeds in breathing life into all of her extremely disparate characters, and manages to write convincingly about WWII, genetics and the beliefs of Jehovah's witnesses, among many other wide-ranging subjects.  All this in a first novel, written in her early twenties!

B00006LSM3|5.0|This CD reminds me a lot of Abbey Road.  When the Beatles knew that it was basically over, they came together one last time and released their masterpiece.  So it is with Brainwashed.  George returns to his roots and records probably the second best solo Beatle record (I'm still partial to Band on the Run.)  Simple but moving lyrics, \\"tasty\\" guitar playing, and his always sweet and soulful voice.  I have listened to this CD about a hundred times and it gets better with every replay.  Get it with the bonus dvd, which is short, but well worth it.<br />Best record of the past 5 years!

B00005JLD2|5.0|A beautiful stark film. An amazing story, almost Disney-esque about young heroines refusing to accept their fate. It is cowardly to put their final fates in printed coda at the end but sensible. The film would have been grotesquely unwatchable and depressing if the film had followed the girls into adulthood. It would have left us with epic deadness. This movie is about a holocaust but is what Schindler's List should have been...intimate, people centered, uplifting for the victories tasted...one gets to know three girls and the coda leaves one to ruminate about the evil done with banal and deliberate thought.
B00006L7XQ|5.0|There are two things the world ought to lament when they go - fresh water and the voice of Johnny Cash.   The man?s words are like thunder in a lonesome valley, or the whisper of a gun across tooled leather.  And for lyricism, with the possible exception of Tom Waitts, Mr. Cash is IT.  In the title track we have Johnny at his prophetic best - when he tells you the hairs on your arm are going to stand up, they do so as if on command.  There?s also a bit of the rollicking old `Boy Named Sue? stuff in the proclamations of the unrepentant killer in `Sam Hall.? <br />His latest recordings for American have seen him doing more than a good deal of justice to other peoples? songs, and this one is no exception.  Depeche Mode, Sting, Trent Reznor and Roberta Flack are among those honored with a Johnny Cash rendering this time.  Of the covers, `First Time Ever I Saw Your Face,? and `I Hung My Head? are standouts, with the Eagles? `Desperado,? Hank Williams? `I?m So Lonesome...? and the gut-wrenching finale of `We?ll Meet Again? coming in strong behind.  Not to say `We?ll Meet Again? (the song from the end of DR. STRANGELOVE, to those who don?t know) is a particularly sad song - in fact, its pretty lighthearted.  But the fact is Johnny is speaking to us all, as he has done at the end of every one of his last albums (with `Unchained? and `I?m Leaving Now? on the previous two albums).  He?s saying his goodbyes while he has the opportunity - and this time he does it with a chorus of friends and family, and it leaves you standing at the fence like the kid in Shane yelling `Don?t leave, John!  Don?t leave!?  <br />What to say about the Man In Black?  Since the days of Elvis Presley he has beguiled his audience with poignant tales of love, God, and murder (that?s a plug - check it out).  On this album, as on all his others over the years, he is a reassuring voice in the stillness, gripping the hand of a dying man.  He is the raging penitent at the bar (or behind the bars), and the soft voice on the pillow in the early morning light.  He tells us yes, there is a God, and He is watching, and you better get right because He is coming around, and we believe Johnny Cash because he?s so much like us.  He?s dirty and petty and he can be mean as hell, but there?s a piece of him under all that black that wants to be good.    As he once wrote, he is trying to carry off a little of the world?s darkness on his back.  God bless Johnny Cash, and thank you sir for a lifetime of heartfelt empathy for all the rest of us without your voice.
B00005U122|5.0|I was at the concert they filmed and it was sensational...far beyond expectations.  This DVD sounds so good, it seems better than a studio recording.  The female singers really added a new dimension and the guitarist seemed as good as the original (David Gilmour).  I highly recommend this DVD for both it's audio and visual experience!
B00006BTCA|5.0|Don't write Interpol off as derivative. \\"Graverobbers,\\" one Amazon reviewer called them. If you listen to this album more than once -- and you're doing yourself a big disservice if you don't -- you'll never be able to come up with a formula of influences that can fully explain this sound. You won't find a Joy Division or Psychedelic Furs track with the heartbreaking tremelo of \\"NYC\\" or the rocking swing of \\"Say Hello to the Angels\\" or the sheer velocity of \\"Obstacle 1.\\" I love dark postpunk bands, and Interpol often aims for a similar mood (and fashion sense),  but their songwriting borrows equally from shoegazers like My Bloody Valentine and pre-punks like Bowie and Eno, whipping it all together into something completely new. This is the most exciting new band out there.
0316666343|2.0|I was looking forward to this book because of the terrific reviews. It was definitely a page-turner for the first chapter, then it was all downhill for me. I did not think it was such a terrific description of heaven! I hope heaven is not just wishing you are back on earth or living the lives of those you left behind with them. Not since \\"Cold Mountain\\" have I been so disappointed by a best seller. I would have liked this book better if the murder victim had just helped to solve the crime or recount how it was solved. Everything else was boring and pitiful.
0151008116|4.0|'Life of Pi' is a fascinating book. The story at its basic level alone is engrossing (that being the survival of a boy trapped in a lifeboat with a Bengal Tiger). Pi's degradation from an unremarkable, vegetarian boy to a fierce hunter dining on the blood and flesh of the sea life he is able to capture is well mapped. One is reminded of Golding's 'Lord of the Flies' in this aspect and 'Life of Pi' does not disappoint. But this is not the only way to look at this book. Martel has imbued his novel with a multitude of layers working together to create a masterpiece of literature. It is not difficult to see how the book won the Mann Booker Prize this year -- one would be hard pressed indeed to fail to see the brilliant craftsmanship behind it. Three cheers to Yann Martel for pulling off such a mighty concept, and for writing what is quite possibly the best book of 2002.
B00006M183|5.0|\\"Riot Act\\" is to Pearl Jam what \\"Automatic for the People\\" was to R.E.M.-- an evolutionary leap to a new musical and emotional plateau.  Where many of their earlier recordings bore the scars of disenfranchisement and rage, this album -- a communal band reflection on the shaky uncertainty of the last 18 months -- stands up strong for humanism when war most threatens it.  Every song offers a different response-- stubbornness (\\"Save You\\"), persistence (\\"I Am Mine\\"), contention (\\"Green Disease\\")-- to unrest both internal and external.  And no one sings about mortality and impermanence with greater tenderness and compassion than Vedder-- proving that a riot act can be read in a whisper and still have the power to confront and heal.
B00005JL96|5.0|For those animation fans who enjoyed the myths, fairy tales, and folk stories Disney had given us in the past, but yearned for a new story that has never been told before, Lilo and Stitch is just what you've been looking for. The animation is clean and tailored specifically to the story-line, the characters are easy to identify with, and the story is unique and perfectly suited for the new millennium. A quirky little girl, her older-sister-turned-guardian, her no-nonsense case worker and her newly-adopted extra-terrestrial &quot;dog&quot; create a story with a little bit of something for everyone. Lilo and Stitch is sure to win the hearts of kids of any age.
B00006LFGD|5.0|First, I am not a diehard Barbra Streisand fan like most of the reviewers here.  I have always appreciated her vocal spirit and turn of phrase.  She is a star of epic proportions and certainly is larger than life in all of the selections on this disc.  I appreciate the remastering of these great duets so that we can hear her music the way it was intended, exposing nuance and that &quot;special&quot; something that can create great harmony.  Secondly, I just have to say the Virginia wierdo that reviewed Barbra's political views needs to watch the inbreeding going on over there because you are using this space to spew your own sensless political view.  Get out there and speak at a Bush Rally and stop knocking what others know in their hearts is best for them!<br />Lastly, expect a marvelous music set on this compilation and let these great stars entertain you.
B000002UAO|5.0|The evolution of The Beatles can be heard the best on this transitional record.  Although many have viewed that 'Rubber Soul' contains a few 'pop-ish' tunes, the bulk of this collection is simply put, the REAL beginning of the Fab Four's movement from just plain Top 40 song producers to honest-to-goodness serious songwriters.<br />From 'Norwegian Wood' (which was originally titled, 'Isn't It Good Knowing She Would') to 'Michelle', 'I'm Looking Through You' and what was voted by Britain's songwriters as the greatest song recorded in the 20th century, John's beautiful, 'In My Life', there is NO doubt that The Beatles wanted to be viewed as the REAL DEAL with 'Rubber Soul'.  You can see even more depth in later album's but nowhere can you hear the change more evident than right here.  Is this their best record?  Nope -- but even so, it still ranks as a truly magnificent piece of work.  Face it, with John, Paul &amp; George you've got arguably 3 of the best musician/songwriters working in the entire decade of the 60's, and Paul would later be ranked as the most successful composer of ALL-TIME according to Guiness Records...you just cannot go wrong when you give them the opportunity to work TOGETHER.  Separately they were absolutely incredible, but when they worked as a team, I defy anyone to produce better music.  As their talents progressed, so did their music, and while some of the later releases are better than others, there is ONE thing they ALL shared in common:  They were all GREAT.  There is simply NO other way to explain their extraordinary global popularity, which STILL continues to this day.  Music that sounds as fresh today as it did when they virtually ignited the British Invasion in the latter part of 1963.<br />Every Beatle fan's library is NOT complete without 'Rubber Soul'...so, if you lack this particular record, I suggest you grab it today...you will forever be grateful.
B000002H33|5.0|I think Metallica must have visited the same crossroads at midnight where Blues Artists Robert Johnson claimed he sold his soul to the Devil so he could play guitar. This is how the Gods intended heavy metal to sound. There is not a single mundane or boring note in the entire album. Kirk Hammet and James Hetfield are the greatest guitar duo in metal ever, period. I have not heard such mind blowing and just plain enjoyable guitar licks and solo's in metal as i have in Puppets. Bassist Cliff Burton adds a whole nother dimension to the already rich sound Kirk and James produce, which just seems to be lacking in later albums like Justice and Black. The 80s produced many good thrash acts, Megadeth, Testament, Slayer, but none came close to making something like this. One of the other reviewers said it best, classical music played by a heavy metal band.
B000002ADT|3.0|This album's phenomenal success is fueled by musical neophytes, and that can mean only one thing: \\"Kind of Blue\\" is the first jazz album many people buy -- and, I sadly suspect, the last. I think of the New Republic writer who mentioned all those Robert Johnson anthologies now \\"gathering dust\\" on record racks (and that didn't deserve to). Ditto this. Too often it's bought out of peer pressure, and enjoyed as a penance. The dreary tempos, Miles aiming the bell of his flugelhorn at his navel, the boppish foreshadowings of his pimps-'n'-pushers noodling -- this isn't jazz, the novice will say. It's BORING! God knows how many people thus believe that jazz is nothing but whining with modulations. \\"America's Classical Music\\" indeed!    What should the jazz novice do? Don't turn to anything else Miles, not even the sublime Cool sessions for Capitol, music that's not easy to know, or love. The Duke? A single disc doesn't do his awesome talent justice, and he made much pretentious music toward the end; even the great Newport concert of '56, exciting as it is (and as brilliantly remastered by Columbia/Legacy), might strike newcomers as the same old same old, for it has a false start and takes a while to get that full head of steam. Satch? If you know not Satch, you know nobody, but his recorded output was huge and his deadly pop vocals of the sixties (\\"He-LLOOOOOOOOO, dollah!\\") form an equally huge artistic barrier. The Count? Close. GRP's three-disc set of his Decca sides is as wonderful as jazz gets, but that 78 sound might tire some. Fats? The most inspired of piano players, an equally inspired entertainer; but he recorded lots of bad songs and BMG has arranged his catalogue for buffs. The musical adventurist can start anywhere; but for the toe-in-the-water types buying Miles only to stash it (and jazz) away, my best recommendation is, start with Stan Getz in his bossa-nova days -- \\"Jazz Samba,\\" or better still, \\"Getz/Gilberto.\\" It's jazz and world music in one; it has definitive playing by one of the best of saxophonists; it has the haunting eloquence of Antonio Carlos Jobim; it has a knockout vocal sex symbol in Astrud Gilberto; and it's great for making out.    A postscript: It's a measure of how much marketing and ignoramuses have taken over this masterwork that until 1995 it was issued with a pitch problem -- and nobody noticed!  That's jazz?
B000000993|2.0|Sorry, this album didn't do much for me. Maybe because i heard the magnificent Lateralus before i heard this one. Now when people criticise Tool for songs sounding the same i'll know why. It's because of this album. The songs on this album are generally strong but thier is a real samey feeling about every one. The guitar's are in the same key in every song and they drag on for 6 minutes. Every song has the same angsty mood. I suggest you get Sober off the net and spend your money on Aenima or Lateralus rather than this mundane affair.
B00006CXSS|5.0|it's amazing. this is the movie that everyone should buy. it's regretful if you miss it in your collection.
B0000640VO|5.0|Five stars because: the piano music is excellent. The part where Amelie rides her motorbike at the end is cool. The guy who works at the fruit stand is funny, especially when he talks to the glass man about his boss. A woman jumps off a church and lands on Amelie's mother. Amelie has a fish whose name is Blubber. And one more reason: Nino. This guy is oblivious, just like Amelie, which makes him cool.
B00006RU5B|2.0|I had never heard much of Soundgarden's stuff, but I am a big Rage fan. I didn't like this album one bit. RATM without Zach isn't RATM and that is VERY obvious in their debut. Zach had the perfect style for Rage that Cornell just doesn't have. Also, taking the political bent out of the music removed a good deal of the fire and passion that Rage had. Very disappointing, maybe one of the worst albums I've heard all year.
B00005Q4CS|4.0|Darren Aronofsky, coming off his chilling breakthrough Pi, managed to bring one of the most accurate portrayals of drug addiction to film with this nerve shattering film.  Ellen Burstyn, Jared Leto, Jenniffer Connolly, and Marlon Wayans give knockout performances as the doomed people who have one kind of addiction or another.  For Sara (Burstyn in her Best Actress nominated role), her addiction is television.  She watches an absurd self help infomercial with hopes that she will appear on it.  When her hopes are elevated, she begins to down diet pills and coffee so she can look thin for the show, and then we watch her slowly deteriorate into madness.  For her son Harry (Leto), his girlfriend Marion (Connolly, looking beautiful as ever), and his friend Tyrone (Wayans), their addictions are heroin and the hopes of making it big in the drug underworld, which they begin to do and then only find everything crashing around them.  Requiem For a Dream is undoubtadly one of the most depressing and heart wrenching films that I have ever seen, and Aronofsky's uncompromising direction shows the viewer the way drug addiction really is: it's not humerous (such as portrayed in films like Trainspotting or even Drugstore Cowboy), and it can be incredibly euphoric, and utterly nightmarish.  All in all, those looking for a different, creative film should give Requiem For a Dream a look, but don't expect to watch it more than once.
0920668372|5.0|Someone sent me this book while I was caring for my terminally ill mother at my home. This unconditional bonding between mother and child exists and never is broken, although the two may reverse roles a bit when approaching death. I cannot read this without tears streaming down my face.  It ranks up there with \\"The Giving Tree.\\"
B00005QIPH|2.0|I don't read many reviews so I cannot say that the hype ruined this recording for me. Actually, I think it's the truly boring nature of it. Or maybe I'm too old, because I think that I've heard every song before. When I listen to it, I hear The Jam, The Smiths, and Frank Black. Who knows? Maybe blues purists listened to Cream and Led Zeppelin and cringed. <br />Definitely nothing new. Rock'n'roll RIP.
0316666343|5.0|I had read the first chapter of this book here on Amazon.com and then went on to buy it later. I couldn't put it down, and read Susie's story with many tears and much laughter. See, I was a girl in the seventies, so much of the pop culture rang so true. This book is a great read and very moving. I must say, I will not give it to my own mother to read as it would be too much for her (I too easily could have been Susie). I would reccommend it to anyone who would like help dealing with death. As a footnote, I applaud both Susie and her Author for including dogs in our own heavens - for what would heaven be without them?
B000003TAB|5.0|This is by far the best album by Nirvana. Many people enjoy the more radio friendly songs but thats just because they dont understand music. The album goes from an upbeat beginning to a rather somber ending and can play with your emotions like no other Nirvana album. The guitar playing flows along with the moods as it goes from rather simple chords to a little more complex as the album progresses to its more angry side. Anyone who wants to here real music should listen to the last 5 songs or so on this album. Most people just dont understand how music works and dont get the pure ride of listening to the music. When u begin to understand music, then buy Incesticide. Otherwise, stick to the horribly awful music of the present.

0553274503|5.0|Flowers for Algernon is an extremely good book.  It is about Charlie who is a mentally-handicapped man that is chosen to go through an experimental surgery to make him smart.  After this, the book goes throughout his entire experience.  It goes through physical, emotional, and, most of all, mental changes.  This book shows that things that seem to be too good to be true usually are.  There are so many different emotions put into this book that it allows this book to be extremely meaningful.  Some parts of the book make you cry and other make you laugh.  Others make you mad at all the mean and rude people all over the world.  Daniel Keyes writes this book in the form of progress reports that Charlie writes throughout his experience.  This helps to tell the story and to get the reader in the mind of Charlie.  The grammar that Keyes uses is also effective.  The book starts out with Charlie spelling things wrong and making grammar mistakes.  After the surgery his grammar and word usage gets better, the smarter he gets.  Everything in this book is there for a reason and is written very well.  I recommend this book to anyone that can find the time to get into it.  That is not hard either.
6304082428|5.0|This miniseries was wonderful!  Of course I liked the book too, but the movie does an excellent job of following the book.  Most movies I see after reading a book are a disappointment.  Not this one.  All 6 episodes are great and each one leaves you ready to watch the next one and when it's all over watch all 6 again. My sister, her boyfriend, and I were talking with British accents for a week.  After watching the BBC miniseries, it makes Bridget Jones' Diary references to Colin Firth and her Roman  interview with him in the sequel regarding playing Mr. Darcy even more hilarious. Anyone who has enjoyed Jane Austen novels or even someone who has only read the Bridget Jones books will really enjoy the BBC miniseries &quot;Pride and Prejudice.&quot;
B000005HN6|5.0|Opeth never ceases to amaze me on their beatifull sound.  I get chills while listining  to songs like &quot; in the mist she was standing&quot;, &quot; forest of octuber&quot;, &quot; the Apostle in triumph&quot;... Such well done songs. Now, you know that every time you purchase an opeth record you will get your money's worth, it happens to me every time. Trust  my wisdon  of good taste in music. Orchid is opeth's debut  incase you still haven't gone to the store and bought it,go now ok ? c ya !
B000068PQ0|5.0|Soundtrack to an Inter-Galactic fantasy.  Far and away the best record of 2002.  Mood swings gracefully flow from high to low with deeply introspective lyrics.  Check out `Ego Tripping at the Gates of Hell and 'Do You Realize'.
0767817710|5.0|I purchased this DVD with limited expectations, fearing that Sharon Stone might make an unlikely character/hero in a Western, but willing to give her the benefit of the doubt.  The Amazon review also left me thinking that this would be a derivative \\"B\\" film.  I viewed this film during a \\"movie nite\\" with friends and we were uniformly pleasantly surprised.  I would call this film a \\"Western Noir\\", with a nice plot twist at the end that justified/explained the protagonist's/Stone's actions in the film.  The star-studded cast was compelling, and the film held our respective attentions.  Video (viewed on a 10' home theater screen) and audio quality were both very good.  True, the plot is limited and basic, but I accepted this as part and parcel of the gendre.  Many stylish camera shots also contributed to our enjoyment of this film.
6305041156|5.0|If Mr. Blakes_Angel from PA (review) thinks Fellowship of the Ring is more exciting or emotional than a movie like &quot;RAN&quot;, then God save us. <BR>RAN and Kurosawa's other epics are way above the rest. His movies leave a lasting impression that one carries for a long time.<BR>But I guess nowadays the mentality of movie watching has dropped down to 12 -14 year olds, and indeed epics like RAN would appear boring to those people.<br />A thousand times recommended for those who like movies with depth and are interested in fundamental human psyche.
B000000W5B|5.0|This album has one of the strangest titles of a major band's releases I've ever heard.  Where does the title come from?  Perhaps the notion that it's something at first you wouldn't want and wouldn't like, but that after a while, you might decide, it's great.  That's how this album is for me.  Back in the 70s, I gave this album a few listens and dismissed it as so vastly inferior to the great streak of Stones albums that preceded it (Beggar's Banquet-Let it Bleed-Sticky Fingers-Exile on Main Street) that it wasn't worth my time.<br />Part of the problem is, the first song misleads listeners as to what the album is about.  \\"Dancing with Mr. D\\" sounds like a parody of \\"Sympathy for the Devil\\" and to this day remains an annoying, clumsy song.  But pretty much everything after that is, on repeated listenings, wonderful--soulful--reflective.  \\"Coming Down Again\\" is exquisite, delicately depicting a waning high.  \\"Winter\\" evokes loneliness and despair in a beautiful way.  \\"Star Star\\" struts unabashedly.  \\"Angie\\" has a vocal track that is surprisingly effective while totally eccentric, and a musical arrangement that's a tour de force. \\"Heartbreaker,\\" \\"100 Years Ago\\" and \\"Silver Train\\" rock hard and convincingly.  \\"Goat's Head Soup\\" is a subtle masterpiece that doesn't yield the kind of immediate pleasures of its classic predecessors, but it sticks with you just as long.<br />One key to the Stones success during this period, it's quite clear now, was producer Jimmy Miller.  His association with the Stones began with the awesome single Jumpin' Jack Flash/Child of the Moon.  He produced everything they did through this album.  He created the space for Charlie Watts to earn recognition as the greatest drummer in rock.  He allowed Mick Taylor to establish himself as the virtuoso soloist who could somehow fit into this rough-hewn band.  He rescued Jagger's vocals from the murk of Andrew Loog Oldham's foggy production, and allowed him to try on the range of styles we now take for granted.  He brought the best out of Mick and Keith as songwriters.  He introduced the use of horns to underscore their gospel and urban blues roots. Jimmy Miller was an unsung hero, and to get everything he did, you have to get this album.for granted.  He brought the best out of Mick and Keith as songwriters.

6305922756|5.0|This has to be one of the funniest films ever made. Could there be a better spoof of a cheesy 80's metal band than Spinal Tap? I don't think so. Obviously, the music is the funniest element of the film. <br />Some of the best moments of this film (in my opinion) are:<br />~the \\"free-form jazz exploration\\" or \\"Jazz Odyssey\\" at the festival park. \\"On bass, Derek Smalls! He wrote this!\\"<BR>~Nigel's guitar solo (you know...with the violin)<BR>~Sex Farm! \\"gettin' out my pitchfork,  pokin' your hay!\\"<BR>~\\"no, The GIG is cancelled\\"<BR>~Stonehenge<BR>~\\"37 different people have been in this band over the years\\"<BR>~Nigel's sustained guitar note \\"aaaaaaaaahhh!\\"<BR>~Big Bottom \\"The looser the waistband, the deeper the quick-sand, or so I have read!\\"<br />...I could go on and on<br />If you haven't seen this film and you love rock music and good comedy, buy this DVD.

B00006JKOM|3.0|This Tull album was \\"lost\\" in between two of their finest, more critically acclaimed (and commercially successful) albums --  \\"Minstrel in the Gallery\\" and \\"Songs from the Wood.\\" It's subtlety and humor were also lost on the critics, but there are some very fine songs here, including Salamander, Big Dipper, Crazed Institution, the title track and, my favorite, The Pied Piper.  In my opinion, this is the best musical era of Tull -- the mid to late 70's -- and this album is at least partially representative of this musical craftmanship.  This is hardly my favorite Tull album, but I still enjoy it a lot. It still perplexes me that this album was so overlooked by both critics and fans. John Glascock is superb on bass (as he is for the next 2 albums before his death in 1979).  The addition of the acoustic song \\"A Small Cigar\\" -- with very clever, witty lyrics by Ian A. -- is a bonus
B00005JKCH|1.0|This movie was terrible, Toby Mcg. can't act, the girl is also terrible and annoying. This is a good movie to get dragged to by your girlfriend or wife. Might as well be named Maid in Manhattan. Dumb movie don't waste your money even to rent. Over rated piece of garbage.  Be Warned
B00005J9M1|5.0|I had this album for many years now. One of my favorites to lift my spirit a bit.<br />I discover many new things everytime i listen to it. This is the best &quot;old-school-techno&quot;, pardon the vulgar expression. But this album really was the base for many other artists like Jamiroquai . if there was an inspiration to create this wonderful genre of music this was, This is why euro trance and techno is been so popular over the years. I remeber the first singles back in the late 80 early 90's when pet shop boys were starting this new movement along with erasure and depeche mode. Althought dm and erasure stopped, well pet shop boys always brought us new sounds and good tunes. And they earned our respect with truly a magnificent wave of great music. This has to be the best work, dont hesitate and get it. because this will bring a smile on your face.<BR>This was an experiment in new sounds, but it turned out to be the best dance album of the decade.<br />you never really skip a song all of the them are truly fantastic.<BR>This album will make up stand up and dance even if you dont like this sort of music, after this you most likely be looking for more pet shop boys
B000067CPX|5.0|Okay, first of all, I have to admit that on first listen, I wish the song had a few more \\"grinding\\" songs, a la OTHERSIDE or SUCK MY KISS or GIVE IT AWAY.  I mean, those are some of the great RHCP songs!!!<br />But once I got over that disappointment, I realized that what we've got here is 12 great songs, 1 pretty good song, 1 weird song and 2 that the album could have done without.<br />I WOULD DIE FOR YOU and MIDNIGHT are the two I always skip.  Just a bit unimaginative a monotonous.  The weird one is WARM TAPE.  Sometimes I hear it and it sounds cheesy, and other times it's almost sexy.  Certainly the lyric \\"Shiver for me girl\\" is a good one!  I can't describe the song though.  You've got to hear it for yourself.<br />The pretty good song is THE ZEPHYR SONG, which is getting a lot of airplay.  It's okay, kinda breezy, but just doesn't evoke any strong feelings.<br />The rest of the album is absolutely top notch.  These guys can really write the tunes now.  CALIFORNICATION (which is brilliant too) served as a kind of bridge from their rougher, earlier stuff to these textured, complex melodies.  The hit single BY THE WAY, which kicks off the album is INSTANTLY, INSTANTLY, INSTANTLY catchy.  I was ready to sing along halfway through the song on the first listen.  Other standouts include the driving CAN'T STOP, the delightful UNIVERSALLY SPEAKING and the latin-flavored CABRON.  <br />Lyrically, the songs are often difficult to grasp.  Don't look for linear meaning.  They evoke moods, feelings and random images.  But Anthony Kiedis sings with real feeling, and the musicianship is first rate all the way through.  They all do their best work as musicians and songwriters, ever.  <br />Two tips: 1) The final song VENICE QUEEN (which is really a two part song) is the secret high point of the album.  It builds with a gorgeous, quiet riff and grows in power.  It could almost have been on Californication, with its West-Coast centric imagery, but I find it a bracing conclusionto this album.  2) Listen to the album with headphones...there is SO much subtlety that you easily miss otherwise, especially some of the grace notes and such that guitarist John Frusciante throws in.<br />It's a great album, and one that should please RHCP fans and draw in folks who've shyed away from some of their \\"rougher\\" stuff before.
B00005V3Z4|5.0|Between the thousands of High-School comedy flicks and Teen slasher films lies a very rare, untapped viewing genre which few moviegoers even consider, let alone bother watching. While the previously mentioned genres deal with basic teen preoccupations such as losing virginity, asserting popularity and curiosity (the perils of opening the cellar door (sic) to find out what that strange noise is), these films have little more to say than 'Hey, we're kids, and we're having a blast'. There is a sense of 'normality' and 'healthiness' that these films choose to base themselves on, usually allowing the odd 'fat kid' or 'freak' a look in for added laughs or to help drive the plot. Donnie Darko is definitely not one of these films<br />Donnie Darko is one of those rare gems that combine a subtle Lynch-esque dark humour with a nihilistic view of the trivialities of society, and what is considered 'normal' behaviour. Unlike the 'American Pie/Scream' banalities, we see <BR>the central character relinquish grip on the world around him, but in his own mind, establishing his own beliefs and opinions, with the assistance of Frank, a very unusual and sinister sidekick.<br />The components that introduce us to the world of Donnie Darko - a misplaced Jet engine, an apocalyptic prophecy made by a man in a macabre bunny suit, and the complexities of Time travel are as strange as the overall atmosphere that pervades this film. The viewer cannot help feeling that as the central character's sanity unhinges, that it is in fact the rest of the world that is going crazy.<br />The acting is amazing, and the plot is superbly driven. The movie succeeds in walking a fine line between many genres, without ever being dominated by one - the film could have turned into comic farce, horror, sci-fi or love story, but chooses to remain uncategorized. The dialogue is blatantly written to make you acknowledge philosophical questions from the Zen-like to the ridiculous. It is a very accessable film, despite all the bizzarre inclusions and enigmatic prose. Similarly, while there is a heavy element of despair and worthlessness, it is not a film that will make you suicidal. However, it is certainly not a film to watch if all you want is a brainless teenage romp. If you want that, go hire out something by National Lampoon. <br />Despite criticisms that the end was a let-down, I honestly thought that it was a good strong ending that answered many of the film's plot points, but left the more important loose ends free for the viewer to interpret, and in keeping with the rest of the movie, was bitter-sweet and thought-provoking.<br />Particular highlights are the first time Donnie sees evidence of time travel, the conversation that he has with Frank in the cinema, the disturbingly realistic twist of the Jim Cunningham character, and the voyeuristic peek into many of the characters alone while a melancholy cover of 'Mad World' is played.<br />Donnie Darko is up there with films like 'Heathers', 'Virgin Suicides', 'Memento', 'Cruel Intentions' and any other film that actually dares to challenge the viewer to look beneath the surface.
B00006F2TV|5.0|This movie was so exciting!  The special effects were wonderful...watching it on surround sound was a great experience.  I highly recommend this movie to all Spiderman fans and to those who haven't given it a try yet.  You won't be disappointed.
B0000640VO|5.0|Jean-Pierre Jeunet has a wonderful child-like view of the world and it's eccentricities. I have seen and loved his previous movies, 'Delicatessen' and 'The City of Lost Children', and always come away with a smile on my face and a twinkle in my eye, like I've shared a playground secret or seen a magician perform a magnificent trick just for my own pleasure. Amelie, like the other two films, faultlessly shows off Jeunet's talent as a director.<br />Amelie is a young woman, who as a child, was brought up in 'unconventional' settings. One evening, she makes a discovery (a child's 'treasure-chest' filled with trinkets, marbles and string) and embarks on a mission to see if human kindness will actually touch a heart. Along the way, she meets several of Paris' most eccentric residents and touches all of them in one way or another with her actions.<br />Amelie provides a hope and optimism that seems to be forgotten in the disposable and nihilistic culture that we perceive - an example of how a small act of genorosity and kindness can change someone's outlook on life, and reaps its rewards.<br />While some of the scenes are almost too sweet, and some of the visions too childlike, Amelie also contains some surprisingly clever and enchanting 'mini-stories' that contribute much to the overall storyline, and overall remind you that no matter how old and matured you get, there is still an innocent quality inside you that can still have fun with a sack of beans or bubble-wrap.
B0000214F2|4.0|Robin Williams is a wonderful actor.  This is one of his best.  It's a delightful story and a great performance.  4 stars for this one!
B00000I4XR|5.0|I find this film to be one of if not thee best film ever!<br />From Cheif Brodys insurcuraties of the sea to the mayor's lack of responsability.<br />I espically love the tension between quinn brody and hooper when looking for the shark. two a turn at falling out and teaming up.<br />A classic.
B000002ADT|5.0|\\"Kind of Blue\\" is often cited as the \\"best\\" or \\"most popular\\" jazz album of all-time.  To be sure, a few quirks need to be worked out.  Miles Davis was playing on modes in \\"Sketches of Spain\\" and \\"Milestones,\\" which both came before \\"Kind of Blue.\\"  The ideas behind the new approach to improvising came from Gil Evans.  Miles was never an innovator in himself; his knack was for picking up on the innovations of the time and exploiting them.  That said, \\"Kind of Blue\\" is indeed a marvelous jazz record.  The spark that puts it above his other records is Bill Evans, whose impressionistic washes of chords elevated a hard bop quartet into pure ecstasy.
B00003CXXM|2.0|Matt Damon, attempting to extricate (sp?) himself from the shadows of Ben Affleck's towering height and talentless public mugging, hits a mediocre note with this utterly predictable catch-as-catch-can movie. Given the carbon-copy, unimaginative [stuff] spewed out daily by the likes of Tom Clancy and John Grisham, the fact that this book is more than twenty years old should speak volumes on how trite and contrived it is. A clear pointer towards the disaster imminent in this movie is the cameo by squinty-eyed \\"actress\\" Julia Stiles, who has made a career on jumping aboard anything thats been done about twenty times and is therefore free of critical harm, in one way or another. The sole saving grace that makes this watchable if you've got nothing else to do on a saturday afternoon? Damon himself. His desperate energy and hunger for a hit make him compelling, even if he is just Good Will Hunting who can't remember his Boston accent. ultimately, the entirely european setting make for some interesting cold-war esque falshbacks as well, but by the end you wouldn't be surprised if Sean Connery showed up going, \\"Hey Matt, cool it. Your name is Bond--the new Bond.\\" It might have made the movie better.
B0000029LG|4.0|Skimming the track list of the first disc is proof enough of its explosiveness. The second disc has been attacked for being weak and pompously placed after such a climax of greatest hits. It is also the first musical statement of Michael Jackson after being accused of child molestation. It was never given proper attention. It is a marvelous disc of stuff. The media has sought to destroy Michael Jackson and the public has for the most part endorsed such hatred. I am very disheartened by this.
B00006690G|2.0|I was never a very big fan of Eminem.  [I think] He is terribly overrated for an MC with basically only one style of flowing.  While his first two albums were bearable, at least the first few times you heard them (except for the singles ack...  Without Me sounds like he is trying to clone the success of the Real Slim Shady and of course the masses loved it.  Then \\"ohh what else would sell albums??\\" how about a few sensitive songs so people could feel sorry for me, hence the tracks Cleanin' Out My Closet and Hailie's Song.  Stay far far away...  peace
B00005ATZT|5.0|Well, this one has got the actor side of things covered.  Harrison Ford plays, \\"Richard Kimball,\\" a doctor accused and convicted of killing his wife over a considerable insurance policy.   Tommy Lee Jones plays \\"Samuel Gerard,\\" of the United States Marshall Service, who is out to capture his fugitive<br />This movie is great.  It is suspenseful without being annoying.    There is something to be said about that.  Rarely can a movie carry with it, considerable suspense, and not drag too far.  Not knowing if this is as a result of the script, actor, or director, I will just say that it is a rare thing to able to successfully accomplish.  <br />I really enjoyed Tommy Lee Jones in this picture.  This movie was probably one of the earlier movies I saw with him in. (I subsequently saw more of Mr. Jones's earlier pictures after having seen \\"The Fugitive.\\" Hey, I was all of thirteen years old when this movie came out)  The \\"Gerard\\" character is great, and totally fitting.   Harrison Ford is always good, but I think Jones makes this picture.<br />This is a great, a good piece in any movie collection<br />epc
B000053V7Q|5.0|I have been an Elvis Presley fan since I was 6 years old. I was only 6 1/2 months old when he passed away. I'm not really sure how it all began, but what I do remember is being very young and seeing this man on TV in a white jumpsuit with a fringy belt dancing and singing. There was something about him that absolutely mesmerized me, even at that age. I realize now that what I was seeing was some part of the original That's The Way It Is film. Now, at 25, I have seen that film dozens and dozens of times and as I got older I would fast-forward through the creepy fan interviews, hotel preparations for the show, and other things just so I could get to the music. <br />When I first decided to view the New Edition I really didn't know what to expect. I had heard that they cut back on the interviews and added some new things. I really wasn't expecting my viewing experience to be any different than it was with the original version. I can honestly say that I was astonished, in a good way. Not only was I extremely glad that they cut out everything that didn't have to do with the music I was excited that they added additional rehearsal footage. I had become so used to seeing the original that I never truly realized just HOW fantastic he was. I felt an excitement that I never felt with the original, a joy that now, finally, THIS is how he was meant to be seen. I can't even begin to tell you how many Elvis videos, cassettes, and tapes I own, that when I view or listen to them there are no surprises for me. Don't get me wrong, I enjoy them but nothing ever struck me as being very different among them. Plus, with an almost constant repetition of listening and viewings you always forget how great some of it was.<br />This new edition totally changed that. In all my 19 years of loving him I have NEVER seen him in this way. I kid you not, I almost felt like I was THERE. I felt the urge to scream, laugh, cry, clap, you name it. I am really, really pleased at this new restoration. I have seen many reviews now saying that people who could care less about Elvis or were never fans became, after viewing this, people who WERE fans. <br />It is a shame that most people now, when you mention Elvis, automatically think of spangled jumpsuits and heavy weight. This is all they associate with Elvis when you mention the 1970's. How wrong they are. Elvis was at the TOP in this film. Thin as a rake, gorgeous, handsome, sexy, he's got the moves, his voice is at the absolute height of his ability here. If you want to talk about charisma, this man had it, people. It's there in the rehearsal footage and it's there in BUCKETS in the concert footage. <br />I could go on and on but I think by this point you understand what I'm saying. THIS IS A MUST-SEE!
B0000640SB|4.0|Barry Sonnenfeld, the man who brought us \\"The Adams Family\\" movie and \\"Wild Wild West,\\" now brings us science fiction that doesn't take itself too seriously.  This is a needed, as well as welcomed event in the genre.  MIB is fun, it is funny, and the effects are top-notch.  I would never base much opinion on a movie because of its special effects, but it certainly adds some interesting things to this movie.  <br />This movie, pits Agent K (Tommy Lee Jones) and newly recruited Agent J (Will Smith) against a notoriously bad creature known as a bug.  Like all good sci-fi heroes, the fate of a planet, in this case, the earth is in their very hands.  <br />I really enjoy Tommy Lee Jones as a general rule. His dry delivery and sarcasm are what makes for wonderful movie material.  Will Smith is fun and cocky as usual, but overall, he is really good too.  All things considered, this movie is well worth owning.  It is fun to watch with friends.  It isn't the greatest movie of all times, but it is good nonetheless.<br />epc
B00003CX8Y|5.0|The 1990's was a great decade for animation. We had old classics like Fantasia, Pinnochio, Snow White and Jungle Book brought back to the theatre with the addition of Toy Story 1 and 2, Aladdin, Anastasia, The Iron Giant and The Lion King (and the late 1980's helped put animated films back on the market with American Tale, Who Framed Roger Rabbit and The Little Mermaid). I think one movie that set the standards for quality in animation in the 1990's was Beauty and the Beast.    The music (composed by Alan Menken, with songs like \\"Be Our Guest\\"), the voices (Paige O'Hara, Angela Landsbury and others), the story and the animation bring it to life. The movie also brings home the old adage that you can't judge a book by its cover. The extra features are nice, too (I'll get to them later). I have to admit I was a bit skeptical about the \\"Human Again\\" sequence, but I think it flows wonderfully with the rest of the film (basically, it's a song the prince's subjects sing in hopes of being human again).     It all starts out when a spoiled and selfish prince is punished for his bad attitude, along with the rest of the castle. He's transformed into a beast, since he acted no better than a beast. His only hope is an enchanted rose, which will wilt on his 21st birthday and the ability to love and be loved before the last petal falls (but he's given up hope on that happening). Meanwhile not too far from the castle, a beautiful, introverted bookworm named Belle (played by Paige O'Hara) is the talk of the village. The pompous Gaston has a big crush on her but alas, the feeling is unrequited. Her father Maurice is a slightly eccentric but lovable inventor. He accidentally stumbles upon the castle and is taken prisoner by the grumpy Beast. Belle comes to save her father and takes her father's place as prisoner. Though his quick temper turns her off, Belle is eventually able to see his true nature and the Beast makes a new friend.     For those of you who prefer the original the wayit was shown in 1991, this is also available on this edition. There are interviews with many of the different cast members, animators and other people behind the scenes. Also, a spoken commentary throughout the film is available. I haven't really bothered with the extra games (those are probably more geared for kids anyways).     To wrap this up, you have until January 31, 2003 to add this classic to your collection. Otherwise, you'll have to wait another 10 years for its release or pay big bucks at auctions for it!
B00005JKZ3|3.0|This was a pretty decent movie.  I was a bit disappointed as the formula that worked so very well in the first film, felt a touch too much like a sequel in this film (yes, I know it is a sequel, but you can really feel it in this movie).  Right after the first movie was such a success, the rumor mill had this one pegged for a return.  <br />The fact that \\"Agent J\\" has become disillusioned with the MIB was kind of a cool plot point, bringing more depth to his character.  And, bringing Tommy Lee Jones back with the \\"De-neuralizer\\" was a pretty cool solution to what happens at the end of MIB.  <br />Overall the movie was pretty good, it is worth having, and it is pretty funny.  Perhaps if I had never seen the first one, this would have been less of a letdown.  I think the movies were too similar.  Where movies like the \\"Die Hard\\" series, seem to reinvent themselves, just enough to remain interesting, I think perhaps MIIB failed this a bit. . .  I score this movie about average.  Hopefully they will redeem anything lost in the next installment.<br />epc
0553277472|5.0|That tells you everything you need to know about this book.  Nearly every single person that has ever read it has either loved it or hated it.  There is no middle ground.  And appropriately so.<br />Sure, I can tell you how much I love this book.  How I have read it 5-6 times, and listened to it on cross-country trips countless more.  But how does that help you?  All that tells you is that the book spoke to me.  But you know that it speaks to lots of people.  And you know that still others can't hear it.<br />I know nothing about you, and so do not know whether you will love or hate this book.  But I do know that there will be no middle ground.

B000059Z8J|5.0|All of America accepts Christopher Reeve as &#34;Superman&#34;.  Adults love this film and so do the kids.  I personally enjoyed the scenes on the farm.  The cinematography that is, the sunrise, the fields of wheat and tall grass.  Superman flying in the air is still convincing.  There is so much to see in this film and so much action, well in fact, it is an epic.  The sets and special effects are breath-taking.  Marlon Brando truly gives this film a good start.  His acting is brilliant, mesmerizing and touching.<br /> In this DVD version, there is so much extra footage (never before seen, not in theaters, however last seen on the ABC Network in the 1980's) many new scenes include Marlon Brando.  One with Christopher Reeve and projected Marlon Brando in the ice fortress.  Also included are deleted scenes, three behind-the-scenes documentaries, screen tests of some well-known actresses who tried for the part of &#34;Lois Lane&#34;.

0316666343|3.0|This book does not live up to its hype. It is an interesting concept, but the writing does not meet my standard for good literature. I had no desire to reread a phrase or a sentence because it was so beautifully written. This is a beach read at best.
B00006CXSS|5.0|If I could give this mini series more than five stars, I would. It is without a doubt the most wonderful show you will ever watch. It is the best ...I have ever spent. I would go as far as to beg you to buy it. You will not be sorry! Buy it so that your kids and their kids can watch it and not forget what our brave forefathers had to go through. You will laugh, cry, laugh, and cry some more! Awesome!
B000059XUI|3.0|I agree with the Spotlight Review.  There needs to be a Special Edition released with all Richard Donner's original footage and storyline restored...Briefly speaking, the producers fired the director Richard Donner while in production on Superman II, and hired Richard Lester.  Lester changed major storylines and added humor that was too campy for the picture.  The Superman II we all have seen is nothing like what Richard Donner and Tom Mankiewicz envisioned, wrote, and shot.  Donner shot 70% of the sequel, but most of that footage has never been seen.  I'd like to see all the Marlon Brando footage that was supposed to have been shot for Superman II, even if it means Warner Bros. has to go and pay Brando whatever he asks for.  The DVD profits would probably more than cover his fee.  John Williams should be hired to rescore, or at least re-orchestrate, the music for Superman II.  Ken Thorne was brought in to take Williams' music and orchestrate and conduct it.  His version sounds like a high school marching band, not a world class orchestra's work.  Still, despite these flaws, Superman II is a good, exciting film.<br />The Richard Lester version we all saw in the theaters could also be included on the DVD, if people want to make a comparison (like the way E.T. was released on DVD).
0679411585|5.0|What can you say about one of the finest works of non-fiction on the shelf.  I own the hard back copy and hopefully it will last long enough for my great grand children to read.  Once I was finished I passed it along to a few people at work including my boss and then over to my father.  Everyone loved it.  It really should be a must read in high school.  Actually, every American should read this book.  It is a testiment to what our soldiers experienced in Vietnam.  There are too many people who take our freedoms for granted.  I admit that I do too sometimes.  But books like this one bring us back down to earth and make us feel thankful were American.
B00004U8JU|5.0|Ok; So I won't write a stupid review about the movie like most people do. I'm not an expert in that field and I believe almost everyone has already seen the film to know about it. But I will tell you about the great DTS track included in this DTS-DVD edition of the movie. It is superior and so much better than the one included in the Dolby Digital edition. People who say they can't tell the difference between the two sound formats are not enjoying their DVDs on the right equipment or are either hearing impaired or just ear-uneducated. In short, I absolutely recommend this DTS-DVD version of the movie that introduced us to the amazing and wonderful sound format in theaters and is now available at home.
B000003P9Z|4.0|MORE ABBA GOLD should be selling more copies than it has. Why? because, it has songs that are more upbeated than ABBA Gold, most of the songs on here are from their first and last albums. It sort of give the average person a more excited point of view. The group mostly did these songs, hopefully for a good credit. With The Visitors LP, the group had the most failure because of the songs were to technical for the day. I believe that if ABBA were to do the reunion  that more MORE ABBA GOLD cd's would top the charts. With the new realeases of their albums (including bonus tracks) I find it very hard to believe that most of the copies left are all The Visitors. I believe that The Visitors should get more credit as this cd was the most upbeat than any other. This CD is also great for people who are tired of  listening to the hits like Dancing Queen, Mamma Mia, and Waterloo. I would rate this cd 4 stars out of 5 for the content. This cd is highly recomended as a great gift.
B00006690G|5.0|I blieve that this is a truly great Album and one of Eminem's best works. The songs are expressed wonderfully and have very powerful messages.To anyone who believes that this a negitive album and you  should really sit down and listen carefully.
B00005JL96|5.0|Disney's best animated film is, strangely enough, neither an epic such as Atlantis or The Lion King, but a relatively simple sci-fi comedy about a rowdy alien who befriends a little girl and her older sister.  That alien, in particular, is named Stitch, the end result of genetic experimentation; he exists solely for pure destruction and now that he's loose on Earth, the aliens send his creator to bring him back.  <br />First, let me get into the drawbacks.  The movie takes a bit longer than the usual animated film to get into its central plot (almost a good half hour!) and I can see how that might test a few kids' attention spans.  The animation itself is mostly very good, but some of the backgrounds are static and maybe less in quality than you might expect.  Probably of greatest concern to parents is, given the destructive nature of the movie's titular E.T., it's possible kids might get scared (though I doubt it). <br />But all in all, these are merely minor quibbles in what is otherwise a terrifically entertaining and heartwarming comedy. The film has appeal for virtually everyone.  The \\"edginess\\" and surprising unpredictability of the material will please those who tire of the typical Disney formula.  Sure, the story is a partial carbon-copy of Spielberg's E.T., but the filmmakers put enough spin on it to make it a work that stands fitfully on its own.  <br />Animated Disney films usually rely on two elements: crowdpleasing, nonoffensive humor and a heartfelt message.  Some Disney movies vacillate back and forth between these with occasional success while some just fail outright.  Lilo and Stitch, on the other hand, works beautifully as both simultaneously, delivering a palpable relationship between the two sisters, meanwhile showing how their lives are \\"wrecked\\" by their interaction with Stitch.  The movie's message, the importance of family, is probably nothing new to avid Disney fans, but I've yet to see it delivered as well as it has here. <br />The voice acting here is excellent; Tia Carerre, Daveigh Chase, Ving Rhames, and Jason Scott Lee all convincingly embed their characters with the right tone.  But the scene-stealer is Stitch, easily the cutest-and possibly greatest-character to come from the Disney vault.  His initial obsession with destruction is hilariously portrayed without going overboard, and his eventual transformation is touching and easy to believe.  If listening to Stitch sincerely state \\"Nobody gets left behind\\" to Lilo doesn't get you choked up, nothing will.<br />In the end, though, Lilo and Stitch is touching without getting overly sentimental.  It's fast, exciting, and hilarious, a much needed tonic for Disney, whose animated movies seemed to be getting worse as the years pass by. Add in an enjoyable Elvis soundtrack given a modern spin, and you've got yourself a movie that can be recommended to anyone.
B000056K04|2.0|I have found one glaring defect on this album.  I exchanged my first purchase for a second cd which had the same errors.  Track 2 ends prematurely with Dave being cut off in the midst of saying 'beginning'.  The track ends with begin and then jumps to track 3.  I also have found some sound engineering flaws at the beginning of track 3 as well.  I can let go of the minor errors on track 3, but the error on track 2 leaves me scratching my head.  How does something like this go unnoticed before mass production of a compact disc?
6300213803|3.0|This second in the Star Trek movie franchise is a lost classic.  Ricardo Montalban (famous for Fantasy Island and driving a Volare) does a great job reprising his role from the television series as Khan. I wish the producers would have found a way to work in his sidekick and real-life comrade Tattoo into the movie as some kind of miniature henchman.  It would have been fun to see him match wits with Spock.  Montalban really shows off his acting chops here, chewing up the scenery like it was bubble-gum.  Hopefully Shatner took notes on being a ham with class.  Also, it is an unexpected treat to look back and see the young Kirstie Alley (as Lt. Saavik, Spocks mentee) before the ravages of fame and Ted Danson reduced her to peddling wicker for Crate and Barrel.  My sources tell me that Montalban is interested in playing Khan one last time.  Check him out in Spy Kids II, he hasn't lost a step!   All in all, too much violence and no Wookies make this a three star film.
B00005YW4H|5.0|I love this CD...it is SO great to listen to when you do not want to be distracted...I can still do all the work I need to do at my desk feeling relaxed and not having a distracted feeling that sometimes comes with other types of music I listen to.
0812550706|4.0|I picked up _Ender's Game_ with few expectations.  After all, I had abandoned science fiction (with a few exceptions, such as Isaac Asimov's oeuvre) long ago for more varied climes, and the long list of books in the Ender series made me very suspicious of Orson Scott Card as a writer.  Well, my suspicion of Card was justified, but my wariness towards the book was not.<br />_Ender's Game_ presents the reader with a not-exactly dystopia inhabited by a frighteningly bright six-year-old boy, Andrew \\"Ender\\" Wiggin.  He is tested relentlessly and in the end comes through.  I vastly simplify things, yes, but that's the essential story.  The ending is extremely moving, and the path there is filled with intriguing plot twists, character development, and quite a few viscerally emotional scenes.<br />Why only four stars?  Well, it's not a perfect book.  I am prepared to grant Ender genius status, for example, but I just can't believe in a station full of eight-year-olds who talk and act like adults.  A station full of teenagers, okay, but the existence of so many adult-minded prepubescents strains my suspension of disbelief a bit too much.  Not much to nitpick otherwise; besides some inexplicable scenes, it's a very solid, well-written book.<br />Unfortunately, Mr. Card couldn't leave well enough alone, but insisted on tying up every last loose end over the course of the next books (_Speaker for the Dead_, quite good but very different; _Xenocide_ and _Children of the Mind_, which I haven't read but which sound rather lacking; and the \\"Shadow\\" series, focusing on one of Ender's co-trainees, Bean, which contradicts Ender's Game and almost threatened my liking for the series).  Ender's Game has a fantastic ending, Speaker a good one, but Card insisted on fleshing out the series, and thus killed the creative, imaginative process that great fiction spawns between author and reader.<br />Definitely read _Ender's Game_; if you need more, read _Speaker for the Dead_.  If you need to know the rest, your own imagination may serve you better than Card's.know the rest, your own imagination may serve you better than Card's.
B00005JKO3|5.0|One of the great classics behind Ben Hur.  Retells the story of the one of the most legendary Spanish heroes during and immediately following the Crusades.  Provides a simplified view of the Christian/Muslim struggle that has existed for nearly 1000 years from a decidedly Christian perspective.  A must see for anyone interested in epic movies.
B00005JL2O|2.0|Alright let me say that this movie is [junk],as a big fan of the first 2 movies i'm shocked to say that but it is.I really tried with this one,i saw it 4 times just to find it good but it didn't work.You can tell that alot of money was put into this movie with all the celebrity cameo's but it was to the point of \\"cut it out already\\" so before i keep bringing down this one let me give you the plot. Dr.Evil is back from space and he has his headquarters in hollywood and they are using a talent agency to fuel the money for another \\"evil\\" plot.First of all beyonce knowles [stinks] as an actress and i say that in a nice way.The character goldmember is not funny and he eats his skin. Austin powers is not funny and his lines get repetitive.Dr Evil is a little better but he drags. Mini me is still cute but the cuteness wears out.Fat Bastard makes a brief apperance, the dvd extras [are awful] and that makes this a piece of trash. But thats my opinion.
0273659030|5.0|If you don't feel confident about communicating through writing (ex. writing an essay) then this book is for you. It is not about improving your style. But it teaches you how to rearrange the ideas you want to present to the reader into a direct and effective form. <br />It improved my writing tremendously. If you think about the ideas presented in the book, they make a lot of sense. They are all after one goal: make it easier for the reader to get your point. The reader will appreciate it!<br />I hadn't written any formal essays since highschool about 10 years. (I am an engineer so go figure!) When I was applying to B-schools a friend who works in consulting recommended this book when he saw me struggling with the essays. The book was not available at amazon. I contacted Barbara, the author, and she was kind to send me the book. She was also very responsive when I had questions on the subject material!<br />Although i struggled with the book because it uses some pretty technical examples from consulting, I was able to transform my essay writing style. And if I get into the B-schools I applied to (top 5), then I owe it to this book, because I believe my weakest point in the application process was writing the essays.<br />I like the part where she talks about the psychology of the reader and how the writer has a responsibility to make the writing as easy as possible for the reader. The parts I found especially useful in my case: arranging ideas in a pyramid, the idea of heirarchy (called induction), causation (deduction), and using titles and subtitles. Oh! and there is a chapter about how to write an effective introduction that I really liked.<br />I was frustrated reading some parts because I didn't understand the examples. But hey! the book is targeted for consultants. But I am certain a person who is not exposed to consulting can benefit from this book. After reading the book once and fast (because I gave myself only 2 days to get done with it and start writingmy essays) I understood about a quarter of it well. But that was enough for what I wanted to do.<br />All in all, I feel that after reading this book I am now equipped with skills that make me a better and more confident writer.
630522577X|4.0|1964's My Fair Lady was the screen version of the popular Broadway play.  The play and the film is based George Bernard Shaw's story Pygmailon and the essence of the story is that Professor Henry Higgins, who is a phonetics professors, makes a bet with his friends that he can turn a cockney flower girl into a refined lady and pass her off as a duchess.  Rex Harrison reprises his role as the professor and the beautiful Audrey Hepburn is the flower girl, Eliza Doolittle.  Julie Andrews was Eliza in the stage version but was passed over for the part as she had never before starred in a film (Ms. Andrews exacted some revenge as she got the part of Mary Poppins and won the Best Actress Oscar that year while Ms. Hepburn was not even nominated).  Noted director George Cukor creates vivid sets and stages subtle, yet enjoyable musical numbers.  While Mr. Harrison sings all his own parts, Ms. Hepburn's voice is dubbed by Marni Nixon (who also provided the singing parts for Natalie Wood in West Side Story).  This is a shame as while Ms. Hepburn did not having the strongest singing voice, it was certainly adequate enough and would have provided more authenticity to role.  My Fair Lady is a classic Hollywood musical and cleaned up at the 1964 Academy Awards winning eight times including, Best Picture, Mr. Cukor for Best Director and Mr. Harrison for Best Actor.
B000063NPX|5.0|Regarded by many as the greatest animated film of all time, Disney's classic &quot;Beauty And The Beast&quot; is a majestic and exhilarating movie experience.  It's a film so amazing, so spectacular, it received six Academy Award nominations, including Best Picture - an historic first for an animated feature film.<br />This &quot;tale as old as time&quot; follows the story of Belle, a bright young woman with a vivid mind, who longs for &quot;something more than the provincial life&quot; than she experiences in her small hometown village in France.  Because of her ambition and her longing for exploration and adventure, she is misunderstood by the other townsfolk.  And also, due to her being the most beautiful girl in town, she has attracted the attention of the handsome, yet unkind, selfish, arrogant, and vain Gaston, the local hearth-throb.<br />One day, after yet again spurning the affections of Gaston, an unusual set of circumstances finds Belle imprisoned in the castle of a (seemingly) fearsome beast.  With the help of the castle's delightful staff, a teapot named Mrs Potts, her teacup son Chip, a candelabra named Lumiere, and a clock named Cogsworth, romance blossoms between these two unlikely friends and Belle soon sees beyond the beast's ugly appearance to the gentle and kind soul that he possesses and learns the most important lesson of all - that true beauty lies within the heart and the soul and not the skin.  Indeed, that is a lesson that the viewer learns as well.<br />Embraced, beloved, and celebrated by moviegoers worldwide when it was released theatrically in the early 1990's, &quot;Beauty And The Beast&quot; will enchant you, delight you, and captivate both young and old viewers alike with it's Oscar winning music (Best Score and Best Original Song), awesome animation, and a cast of the most lovable and memorable Disney characters the screen has ever seen (except of course, for those seven little men!)
0425170349|4.0|Basically the book is about a team Mr. Clark has put together of the best-of-the-best counter terrorist specialists.  Clancy's description and character building are exceptional along with the fact that this is an action novel (which rarely give you much in terms of character development).  The book is long, but very enjoyable due to the story of the building of the team and their first operations.  Just because this novel does not take place in the halls of politics or on a warship, his knack for technical and political story telling is not missed.  This is a great addition not just to a Clancy library, but a military library as well, due to his knowledge of the subjects he writes about.  I can't wait until the follow up to the Rainbow Six.
0066214122|4.0|This was a good book... and I read it fast.  It has some technical stuff but nothing the average reader can't get through.  I'm wondering about the sequel???  Hope it comes out soon.
B000002UAU|4.0|This is very good pop music. It definitely is not rock and roll.
0316666343|2.0|I can't believe that there isn't one criticism of this book found in the editorial reviews. Maybe it is out of respect for the author and what she has survived that no one dared to write a negative review publicly. I (reluctantly) read this book for a book club, and I admit that the first 100 pages or so kept my attention. But there could have been so many themes here -life after death, faith, the mind of a serial killer, marriage issues, etc that were touched upon but ultimately left hanging. The book didn't seem to have any real message or coherence. Aside from the unusual perspective, I felt like I might as well have been reading a Judy Blume novel about adolescence.
B000002UAX|4.0|Overall a great album, but can never seriously be given 5 Stars due to the abomination of Revolution #9.
B00005JLRR|1.0|I liked this movie more the first time I saw it, when it was called \\"Star Trek Insurrection.\\"  Yet somehow I remember it having a kind of cool subplot about the philosophy of living in the present moment that is somehow missing this time around.  Now it's just the \\"one guy with a few friends somehow managing to get the biggest weapon in the universe so he can destroy his home planet because, apparently, that's the main motive in the universe.\\"
B00006LSM3|5.0|With his album BRAINWASHED George Harrison demonstrates that his artistic talents had not diminished since ALL THINGS MUST PASS.  What is truly amazing is that he composed these twelve tracks when he was terminally ill.<br />At times his voice may seem strained, but it never detracts from the music.  His signature guitar sound is rarely absent throughout the CD.  Because of it, you feel like you are spending time with an old friend.  Thankfully, Mr. Harrison maintains his musical integrity by not attempting to insert a pop tune or two to appeal to the general audience.  The only song that could possibly receive air play on a Top 40 station would be \\"Rising Sun.\\"  Nevertheless, I would not even place it in the pop category.<br />The beautiful instrumental piece \\"Marwa Blues\\" could be considered the album's interlude.  George is almost saying to us, \\"And now I would like you to meditate awhile before we go on.\\"  The chant at the end of the album was an inspired gesture on the part of the producers, Dhani Harrison and Jeff Lynne, to conclude George Harrison's last work with a fitting \\"Amen\\". <br /> How could a man close to death create one of his finest albums?  Anyone who followed his career would know that he was always in touch with his spiritual side.  Death for him was not an end but a passage.  So he had nothing to fear.<br />He has left us a wonderful body of work that unquestionably will stand the test of time.  BRAINWASHED was his exclamation point!
B00003Q43A|5.0|I've always loved alien invasion stories, and Independence Day is the best I've ever seen!  From the first scene to the last, this alien invasion story is a veritable feast for the senses, with flying saucers, \\"kewl\\" explosions, and aliens that make even the classic movies' aliens look like pussycats by comparison.<br />What makes Independence Day so wonderful for me is the fact that there is also a genuine story to it that gives it dimension and depth.  It tells the tale of President Thomas Whitmore (the always charming Bill Pullman), a man who is suddenly forced to confront something he'd always thought was a figment of science fiction writers' imaginations--an alien invasion force that could possibly wipe out the entire human race.  He finds himself forced to enlist the aid of David Levinson (Jeff Goldblum), his former nemesis and the estranged husband of his White House aide, Constance Spano (Margaret Colin), and David's father, Julius (Judd Hirsch).  As the survivors drift toward Groom Lake and the mysterious Area 51, Whitmore meets up with Capt. Steven Hiller (Will Smith), a young Marine who lost his best friend Jimmy (Harry Connick Jr.) in the initial attack, and Hiller's girlfriend Jasmine (Vivica A. Fox) and her son; Russell Casse (Randy Quaid), a Vietnam vet and alien abductee; and Brackish Okun (Star Trek: The Next Generation's Brent Spiner), the crackpot head scientist of Area 51.  He is also reunited with his wife and First Lady Marilyn Whitmore (Mary McDonnell) in one of the most moving scenes I've ever witnessed in a film.<br />One of the things I liked most about this DVD was the fact that it allowed me to choose between both the theatrical release and the director's cut, which has some scenes cut from the theatrical release.  There is also a second DVD that is chock-full of extras, including a Russell Casse scene that was ultimately left out of even the director's cut, but which was pretty cool nonetheless.  Ultimately, I have to say that this is a DVD that was worth every penny I paid for it.DVD that was worth every penny I paid for it.

B0000399WI|4.0|Tim Robbins and Morgan Freeman make for a stunningly good team in The Shawshank Redemption.  Based on the \\"Rita Hayworth and the Shawshank Redemption\\" novella that appeared in Stephen King's Different Seasons and directed by Frank Darabont, The Shawshank Redemption is the story of Andy Dufresne (Robbins), a young banker who is convicted of murdering his wife and her lover and sentenced to life in the Shawshank State Prison in Maine.  His guts and resourcefulness earn the friendship of Red (Freeman), a lifer who is known around the prison for procuring otherwise unattainable things, such as the rock hammer Andy uses for his sculpting hobby.  Because of Andy's will to survive the harsh conditions of the prison as well as the corruption of the warden and the guards he soon earns the respect and friendship of the other inmates as well.  Although Andy seems to have accepted his life sentence, the other inmates soon find out otherwise when it is discovered that he might not be the guilty party in the murder of his wife and her lover after all.<br />All in all, The Shawshank Redemption is a very good movie with a fine supporting cast in Bob Gunton (the warden), James Whitmore (Brooks), Clancy Brown (the head guard), William Sadler, and Gil Bellows.  My only real problem with the DVD was the lack of extras, but I enjoyed the film nevertheless.
0316666343|1.0|Now I have read the worst book of my entire life.  This book had no redeeming values what-so-ever!  Believe me, it is a waste of time.  The characters were shallow, and you really could care less what happens to them.  The story didn't flow right, and was all over the place.  She would introduce characters (Ruth) and then you never knew or cared what happened to her.  And her idea of Heaven, for gosh sakes, Woman, read the Bible!  Who wants to live a life for God only to end up in a place like what she describes Heaven to be!  Please don't waste your time like I did, and pick a better book for Book Club.  Life is full of enough despair without adding more to it.
B00005JLRR|4.0|but this isn't a particularly great movie. Basically it's like a three part Next Generation episode. There is nothing here to attract people who aren't fans. Star Trek attracts all types so I'll describe myself as average! I have all the Next Generation shows on pre-recorded video and their other two movies and have seen them all many times. In all honesty the only really good movie they have done is the Borg one. However I will still faithfully buy this probably on DVD when it's released. So to sum up; it's one for the fans!
B00005YW4H|5.0|Come Away with Me is a great CD.  It has something for every music fan.  Don't Know Why has a sexy vulnerability to it that I loved.  Come Away is a smooth romantic song that I enjoyed very much.  You'll love these two songs if you are a fan of jazz or easy listening.  Turn Me On and Lonestar are  sultry  sassy tunes.  You will enjoy these songs if you like country or the blues.  Norah's rendition of Hank Williams' Cold Cold Heart is really pretty too.  Seven Years is a simple but pretty song about the carefree nature of childhood.  One Flight Down is a very good song about the effect of music on the human mind.  I really like it, because it shows that Norah is a talented piano player and an amazing vocalist at the same time.  Painter Song is a dreamy blissful song about wanting to be with someone.  Norah Jones' voice is so soothing and enjoyable.  This is a great CD.
0316096199|5.0|Sebold does an excellent job telling the story of her own rape with enough distance for the reader to feel develope his or her own perspective, while simultaneously explaining her innermost feelings.  Unlike many other stories of rape, she leaves the reader in the understanding that despite how far she has come since the actual rape, it is still something she deals with on a daily basis.
B00005OAIE|5.0|I bought this CD after I heard the now famous \\"no such thing\\" on a public radio station in philly, WXPN (my favorite) in February 2002.  After listening to it non-stop, i had an infatuation with John Mayer's lyrics and musical talent.  His voice is captivating and sexy with his fun yet down to earth tunes.  The only thing that bothers me about John Mayer is the teeny-bopper following that has developped.  These kids don't appreciate his music for what it is, and that is what frusturates me -now that i can't get tickets to his sold out shows as well.  i recently bought his first album, Inside wants out, which has some songs that aren't on Room for Squares, but others are repeats.  I suggest this album strongly to those who appreciate good music- even if \\"everybody else\\" likes it.  Enjoy. (i'm open to suggestions from you! let me know what else i'd like!)
B0000033IS|5.0|This album has been voted, by public poll, #97 on the list of the 100 Best Albums.  A VH1 poll of the music industry itself places it significantly higher at #30.  Personally, I believe VH1 has the better placing for it.<br />Songs as follows:<br />1. Respect--High energy chart topper that retains every bit of its punch at this late date.  Predates rap as a cultural document.  <br />2. Drown in My Own Tears--a much slower paced song that is beautiful and melancholy.  Another great song.<br />3. I Never Loved a Man (The Way I Love You)--Title cut of the album isn't quite as good as some of the other songs, but it works, again both viscerally and culturally.<br />4. Soul Serenade--beautiful.  Perhaps the most musically beautiful song on the album.<br />5. Don't Let Me Lose This Dream--a heartbreaking testament to the fragility of dreams.  This song gets the golden teardrop for saddest song on the album.  ;)<br />6. Baby, Baby, Baby--weakest song on the album.  Nothing wrong with it, even then, it just is the least memorable.  <br />7. Dr. Feelgood (Love Is a Serious Business)--Upbeat swinger that manages to have a suprisingly rosy outlook.  A nice change of pace.<br />8. Good Times--If this one doesn't get you on your feet, give up on music.  High octane number that never gets old.<br />9. Do Right Woman, Do Right Man--another beautifully melancholy look at the double standard.  Gets high marks both musically and lyrically.<br />10. Save Me--What more can be said? It's more of the same.<br />11. Change Is Gonna Come--A fitting close to a fantastic album.  The emotion of this song is undeniable, heartfelt, uplifting and moving.  <br />Truly, this is one of the greatest albums of all time.  Every song manages to succeed in the way it is intended, whether as a upbeat toe tapper or an emotional catharsis.  How many albums can you say that about? Not a whole heck of a lot.

B000059PPN|5.0|House By The Cemetery is easily one of Fulci's most accomplished and impressive films. It just drips with atmosphere and features many wonderful set-pieces. The plot involves a family moving into a creepy house, which, unbeknown to them, contains a hideous and deadly secret. There's no need to know any more than this, and as a matter of fact, the plot is so full of huge gaping holes that you will have to forget about logic completely most of the time! But once you do this, you are in for some terrific entertainment. The film starts slowly, buliding a sense of foreboding about the house by introducing a ghostly little girl who communicates with the young son of the family. These scenes are delicate and appealing, and they contrast superbly with the scenes if gory horror that soon proliferate as the monster hiding within the house begins to claim his victims. While quite restrained when compared to \\"The Beyond\\" or \\"Zombi\\", the murder scenes on display are still pretty shocking, especially the death of one victim whose foot is trapped in a cracked floor; she is stabbed to death slowly and repeatedly, with the camera closing in on every blood spurt! There's also a real jolt in a scene when the young son is trapped behind the cellar door and his father tries to break it down with an axe...watch out for it! This then leads to the real surprise, which is the last twenty minutes of the film when the family face the monster in the cellar, and have to take it in turns fight for their lives...the suspense is superb, and Fulci has never equalled it since.<br />Beautifully shot in widescreen, the sets and locations look stunning, and the monster, when finally seen, is truly repulsive! I wholeheartedly recommend this to all horror fans

630522577X|5.0|MY FAIR LADY is a musical adaptation of Bernard Shaw's play PYGMALION. <br />It enjoyed a long and successful run on Broadway with Julie Andrews starring as Eliza Doolittle. Julie was replaced by Audrey Hepburn for the movie. This was of course a major change which was met with much skepticism. Audrey turned in a superlative performance although her singing voice was provided by Marni Nixon. Rex Harrison in the role of Professor Higgins proved to be as good in the film as he was on the stage. Stanley Holloway was superb as Alfred P. Doolittle.<br />The movie walked off with most of the Academy Awards in 1964 winning Oscars for Best Picture, Best Actor (Rex Harrison), Best Director (George Cukor), Color Cinematography, Color Art Direction, Sound, Adapted Musical Scoring and Color Costume Design. Nominations were also received for Best Supporting Actor (Stanley Holloway), Best Supporting Actress (Gladys Cooper), Adapted Screenplay and Editing. Ironically Julie Andrews won the Oscar for Best Actress in that same year for her appearance in MARY POPPINS.<br />Some of the more interesting DVD features are the commentary by Marni Nixon and the alternative versions of two songs using Audrey Hepburn's own voice.

0679720200|5.0|I read this book once when I was young and then again two years ago. Two different translations: the first one I read was called The Outsider, the second one, The Stranger.<br /><br />Now we are reading it in French and discussing it in class. The writing is much more beautiful in French.<br /><br />In year 2000, there was a survey amongst 6000 French readers. The question was: &quot; Which book, do you think, is the best of 20th century? &quot; French readers picked L'&Eacute;tranger. I agree. The Stranger is, in my opinion, the best book written in 20th century. The complexity of human nature tackled with the simplest of writings. It is beautiful to read, heart-wrenching to contemplate.<br /><br />And which book has ever been able to beat this opening line:<br /><br />&quot;Aujourd'hui, maman est morte. Ou peut-être hier, je ne sais pas.&quot;<br />(&quot;Mother died today. Or maybe yesterday, I don't know.&quot;)<br /><br />If I could compare this book (and its protagonist) to any other book I've read, I would choose Graham Greene's A Burnt Out Case and its architect Querry.<br /><br />We are not very good at dealing with the different, the outsider, the stranger. And since there is more of us, we find a way of making them miserable, not letting them be, forcing them to be like us, trying to neutralize them, to make them ordinary, to reduce them. When they slip, we use the opportunity to get rid of them for good. (In the case of Graham Greene's Querry, he didn't even have to slip. We can always make things up.)<br /><br />Meursault killed a man. In his trial we say, in fact try to use it as evidence, that he did not cry in his mother's funeral.<br /><br />We are merciless when it comes to the different. I know, by first hand experience, how cruel we can be when we encounter the stranger.

B000065U1N|5.0|This movie's  i can't say is my favorite war movie but is probably in my top 10.  It's not a big Josh Hartnett video, he is not a huge character.  I have also done research on the problems in Somalia and this movie is very accurate.  It portrays this perticular event very well and doesn't add extra stuff on the side like the romance that Josh Hartnett had in Pearl Harbor. It is a good movie and i'd give it a 4 1/2 rounded up to 5.
006016848X|5.0|Don't be fooled by the feminists bashing of this book and its author because they are afraid that it tells the truth about the differences between men and women. They try to discredit the book and it's author with their politically correct dogma which ,in and of itself, has very little basis with the reality of gender relationships worldwide. Read the book with an open mind and you too will see the truth and realize that there is hope for better relationships between women and men.

This CD is definately one of the best CD's I have ever purchased!!
B000002IZM|5.0|Being a bachelor who lives on their own in a small apartment, this CD is the music of my choice when I'm at home (whether I be shaving, waking up, doing errands or simply relaxing. The music on this CD transforms my apartment into some sort of space-age futuristic bachelor pad - just like Deckard's apartment in the movie &quot;Blade Runner&quot;. After a hard day's work, returning home to the sounds of &quot;Blade Runner Blues&quot; soothes the soul. &quot;Memories of Green&quot; is perhaps my favourite track and never fails to get me sentimental and nostalgic about friends, relationships and family. The background sounds on many of the tracks give you the feeling that outside you really are living in the cold futuristic L.A. portrayed in the movie. While some say the track &quot;One More Kiss Dear&quot; is out of place, for me it adds to the overall atmosphere of the CD and perfectly recreates images of Harrison Ford's moody P.I. eating in a neon-soaked rain-drenched city of the future.
B00006JJ1O|5.0|This is a great cd. Although, it's a bit weird cuz I heard all the Russian songs first. It's very fun dance music. They may draw you in with the lesbian appeal, but the music keeps you listening. I'm glad I discovered them. And if you like this cd, I suggest you buy/download the Russian version (which I prefer), 200 po vstrechnoy (the same title, just in Russian.) ;D
B00005OWEG|3.0|Much like another reviewer, I give Redux three stars because of the fact that Apocalypse Now is such a great movie.  But, really this expanded reissue was a disapointment to me.  I had heard about the French plantation part of the movie for a long time.  However, instead of adding to the movie it causes it to grind to a halt.  The original moved at a great pace, hitting all the sweet spots on the way to Kurtz's compound.  The French plantation scene adds nothing to the understanding because it was too long.  It's nearly half an hour long!  The other little added scenes do add something more to the film.  The Playboy Playmate encounter was not that great either.  I liked that Chef ached for the girls during USO.  The added scenes with Brando are not bad, but by that time I was tired.  I think the movie suffers from a want to add everything that Coppola had to take out when the movie first came out.  Some of that stuff should have stayed out, and I'm glad it did.  This time around he made the mistake of wanting to add too much.  Like I said, the little touches, like the expanded interpay with Kilgore was good.  However, it was more of a novelty than something of substance.  All the scenes combined did not add to the original Apocalypse Now.  It shouldn't have been redone.
B00002E233|5.0|Star of the TV series In the House, and rap artist, LL Cool J plays the part of the cook for the underwater research center. His acting is good in this movie and he has a couple of humorous sceens. And don't worry, he does NOT do any singing in this movie. <BR>All the other characters are great and the special effects are fantastic. YOU WILL NOT FIND ANOTHER MOVIE THAT HAS MORE REALISTIC SHARKS!!!<BR>There were sceens that actually made me jump back in my chair, and I am not someone who ususally gets startled by a scary movie.
B00005V3Z4|5.0|What can I say that everyone else hasn't... how about watch the damn movie.  Help make this movie the cult hit it deserves to be...  Besides, your buddies at school will think you're cool because you know GOOD movies, and the ladies will either find you sophisticated or wierd(which according to the movie is a compliment)...
038533558X|4.0|This is the first Harlan Coben book I have read, and it will not be the last.  I grew up in the very same Livingston neighborhood where this book is set.  That definitely enhanced the story for me.  The dizzying plot twists made me wish the book was a bit longer.  I am pleased to see that people all over the world enjoyed this book, and not just myself and the other reviewer from West Orange, NJ.
6305311463|4.0|I recently saw \\"Armageddon\\" for the first time on DVD and thought it was a fantastic example of movie entertainment.  It's an excellently-produced science fiction/action/adventure movie.  The special effects are top-notch and truly breathtaking.  Script and character development are above average for this type of film--but of course, this is NOT \\"Othello\\"!  The storyline is extremely interesting and the movie's pacing is packed with edge-of-your-seat suspense, with just enough deadpan comedic relief.  I found no fault with the actor's performances--Bruce Willis does his usually-good \\"John Wayne\\" and considering this is sci-fi, the others gave FAR less wooden performances than, say, would be seen on ANY episode of \\"Star Trek: The Next Generation.\\"  The movie could've done without the dumb Aerosmith tunes in the soundtrack, but that's a minor criticism.<br />Since I thoroughly enjoyed the film, I was dismayed to see a lot of negative comments by Amazon.com reviewers who appear (in my opinion) to be \\"cinema snobs.\\"  And after \\"reading between the lines\\" of these reviews, I see a pattern of thought--which I thoroughly disagree with.<br />The underlying \\"theme\\" of \\"Armageddon\\" is simply that for the most part, Americans--in addition to American values and technology--save the world.  The attributes that Americans (although certainly not exclusively) are known for--courage, heroism, patriotism, both stubborn individuality AND one-for-all/all-for-one team determination--are very much a part of this story.<br />I wonder if many of the negative reviewers were put off by the \\"Rah-Rah USA!\\" tone of the film.  There is a certain type of liberal/artsy, anti-American, anti-NASA, anti-patriot attitude that would loathe a movie like \\"Armageddon\\"--and such a mindset would probably color such a reviewer's comments.  That's unfortunate, because although \\"Armageddon\\" is very much an \\"American\\" story, it also exhilaratingly examines some of the very BEST elements of the all-inclusive human spirit.
B00005B36H|5.0|As many fans waited anxiously for the release of TOOL's newest album, the members of the band were busy recording one of the most complex and mind bending albums to date.  With Aenima and Undertow already being heralded as classics on rank with Zepplin and Floyd, the question of whether the album would be worth the wait is redundant.  When released, Lateralus was consumed by the millions of so-called TOOL fans who, in the weeks following, began posting online that the album was \\"boring\\" and \\"repetitive.\\"  The reason so many people did not understand the new album is simply because the album is too complex for the normal listener to grasp.  I am not trying to say that I am any smarter or better versed in music than any other listener, but when someone listens to a CD once and tosses it away with disdain, it goes to show that they have no interest in music.  That listener is only interested in what society thinks is good.  I admit, when I first listened to Lateralus, I was not very excited.  But, after I sat down and truly listened to it with an open mind, I was completely in awe.  The melodies, harmonies, and ryhthms are so complex and so far ahead of the (horrible) \\"pop music\\" scene that there is no wonder many \\"fans\\" did not understand. This album is simply to deep for the general public, the (pop)ular music listeners.  My advice is to turn off your radio and take the time to feel, not listen, to this intensely amazing album.  It holds the potential to open your eyes and mind to a completely different world.
B0000648WZ|4.0|The Good Things<br />*Great special effects and lots of bloody action.<br />*Fun cast of characters, even if they are a little adolescent.  Strong focus on relationships.<br />*Lots of funny but bleak satire (in true Paul Verhoven style!).  Similar to \\"RoboCop\\".<br />*Fascinating view of future society.<br /><br />The Bad Things<br />*Very gross; not for the squeamish.<br />*Themes are a little ambiguous.<br />*Altogether, a little corny and adolescent.<br /><br />This film definately entertains with its cool spaceships, alien bugs, and graphic war scenes.  With a cast of characters who seem childish, and with the director's bizzare style, the film seems very odd, extreme, and phony in a lot of places.  I'm also not sure what the film's message is supposed to be.  But whatever the case, it is enjoyable.
B00000AFFI|4.0|I remeber the summer of 1998. I got stucked to Radio 3 Spain during awhole weekend listening to the Benicassim Festival broadcast.On Friday, the first day, PJ Harvey was going to premiere some songs of this record. I was her fan since I saw the video of &quot;Down by the water&quot;, though when i bought &quot;To bring you my love&quot; i stayed a little cold (basicly because of the &quot;synthetic&quot; rcordings of &quot;Meet ze monsta&quot; and &quot;Working for the man&quot; -every fan should listen to the live versions in Glastonbury 1995).<BR>I taped her show that night and fell in love with the new tracks; i was surprised in september, when the record came out, to see that the live performances of two of my favourite songs were radically different from the ones in the record, which is a good thing to say about Polly: she knows how to rework the songs to make them work live. The problem is that i still love the live versions better: the agressive keyboard on &quot;Joy&quot; (similar to the one in &quot;Down by the water&quot; but a lot more raw) and the drum machine were substituited by a wonderful rock riff and Rob Ellis' perfect drumming live; as well as for &quot;The garden&quot;, which sounded mysterious live and in the record is also,...synthetic, i can't think of any other word.<BR>The other tracks she played that night were &quot;Angelene&quot;, &quot;A perfect day Elise&quot;, &quot;Electric light&quot; and &quot;Is this desire?&quot;; all of them are perfectly performed in this record.<BR>My favourites are, anyway, &quot;Angelene&quot; and &quot;No girl so sweet&quot;, which i find so violent (that whining violin, the drums, the lyrics: &quot;I don't mind if you take me down and i don't mind if you break it all but, how much more can you take from me?).<BR>So, basicly, the reason why i don't give 5 stars to it is because i always have to end up skipping &quot;Joy&quot; and &quot;The garden&quot; and search for the tape of the show to enjoy them. It'san excellent record.As beautiful and annoying as all of her albums.
B00005JL78|5.0|I can best sum this film as a police thriller in the future.  Its story line in itself provides an entrancing mixture of suspense, thrills, and action (all naturally embellished by Speilberg's direction).  But there's more to this film than that.<br />The entire movie is filmed with monotonous colors (except for one flashback scene).  There are many gray, black, white, and blue colors (similar to the way &quot;Payback&quot; was filmed).  I wouldn't doubt that the coloring of the film adds an artistic level to it, and perhaps highlights some important motifs.  It also makes the future world appear darker and gritter, despite the effects of excessive commercialization.<br />There are other interesting motifs involved, including water (water water everywhere!) and eyeballs (many closeups of eyeballs, not to mention the fact that the main character gets new eyeballs installed in his sockets).  There are a lot of interesting devices in the film that gives it cinemagraphic depth.<br />The film's ideas of the future in themselves are interesting, particularly since they are derived from a compilation of minds.  There are holograms everywhere and retnail scans everywhere.  Privacy is starting to become abolished.  Genetic technology was discussed briefly.  There are many other aspects, but the most abundant seems to be the role of visual graphics.  Holograms and motion video have become a part of daily life - everything is in motion.  People can even manipulate the video images with their hands, as if they were orchestrating them in a holographic orchestra.<br />The characters of the film are fairly well developed.  I found the most interesting characters to be the 'precogs' who can detect murders before they happen.  They remind me of the guild navigators from &quot;Dune,&quot; only the precogs are more emotional and traumatized characters.<br />Overall, I found this to be a very enjoyable film, perhaps even the best Speilberg film of them all (it is certainly my favourite Tom Cruise film).  It's visions of the future, characters, and story have stuck to my brain like an echo.  I can't help but to see it again...and again...like an echo...Tom Cruise film).  It's visions of the future, characters, and story have stuck to my brain like an echo.  I can't help but to see it again...and again...like an echo...
B000002UAO|4.0|Rubber Soul is an album with vast historical implications - both for the band and for rock music as a whole - that are myriad and need not be gotten into. It is often mentioned as the album where The Beatles &quot;got serious&quot; - inspired by Dylan and the American folk-rock movement - and moved beyond &quot;silly love songs&quot; and began tackling more complex territory, as well as incorporating diverse new musical instruments and using the studio itself as a tool. This is all very well and good - and, no doubt, extremely important - but the unfortunate thing, to me, is the fact that this is actually quite an excellent album in its own right - aside from all of that - often gets overlooked. Rubber Soul is superior, in my opinion, to the subsequent Revolver, which is quite often touted as the Greatest Album of All-Time. The lyrics show a level of maturity and deceptive cleverness that was absolutely unheard of in rock music at the time. Although not poetry, and by no means equaling the lyrics of Dylan, they still stand up very well today, and are vastly better than the tripe put out by most rocks bands before and since. A fact that often goes unmentioned is that, as always with The Beatles, the gorgeous, sweeping melodies and beautiful, perfect vocal harmonies remained, this is, lyrically, a very dark album. Practically every song - Paul's, too, not just John's - deals with the darker side of love: broken hearts, infidelity, and the like. (The hilarously misogynistic closer Run For Your Life being the album's one unfortunate blemish - carichature to the point of embarrassment.) Musically, the album was also more complex than its predecessors, and still sounds fresh and vibrant today. Highlights include the very fun Drive My Car; Norwegian Wood, with its haunting melody and enigmatic lyric (many, including Lennon himself, declared Dylan's Fourth Time Around to be a parody of this song); John's interesting Nowhere Man; the sweet and simple Michelle; and In My Life, one of the great Beatles masterpieces. To this day, an essential rock and roll record.

So, instead, I will try and direct my review to the skeptics out there that don't think fantasy books are worth their time of day. I was one of those people and I am eating my words. <br />I work in a bookstore and it seemed everyone had read LOTR but me. Finally, I gave in and read it, admittedly after seeing the first movie. I can say that I have never been more drawn in or got more enjoyment from anything I have ever read. Tolkien has created an entire world, complete with landscapes, maps, languages and races all from his imagination. But the morality and heart of this book is the true gift.

B000002KKS|3.0|I liken the switch of Ronnie James Dio for Ozzy Osbourne to the switch of Sammy Hagar for David Lee Roth. The first albums succeeding the original singers (Heaven and Hell, and 5150) were pretty good, but then the succeeding albums faded fast. You just can't replace a David Lee Roth or an Ozzy Osbourne. Ozzy's intensely psychological lyrics made the band, and although Dio does a good job on Heaven and Hell, the style of the music is totally different. Yes, there are some good songs on here, and it's worth buying, but don't assume that you will get genuine Sabbath material in this album.

B000002KE2|4.0|This is one of those albums where you may want to burn your favorite songs to another blank CD, and trade in the original CD. The really good songs are: Wheels of Confusion (probably the best one), Tomorrow's Dream, Supernaut, Snowblind, Laguna Sunrise, and St. Vitus' Dance. The others are below average. But the album is definately worth buying.

B000002KIK|5.0|This album may not be the most unique Sabbath album, but (with Ozzy) it's by far the most different in style. A lot of heavy metal bands were influenced by Sabbath, and this album is a transition from grungy slow metal to the more streamlined catchy metal of the 80's. But that doesn't mean that this is a big hair band album! It's basic Sabbath, with faster songs, and even saxophones and piano, making the band very multidimensional. The songs are not classics, but some of them should be, like &quot;Hard Road&quot;. This album is a taste of what was to come for Ozzy's solo career, and is a must-have for any Ozzy-Sabbath fan.
B0000797IO|4.0|Why is &quot;The Good Girl&quot; a good movie?  Simple: the writing.  The movie (thank God) never goes where you expect it too.  The twists and turns are very funny.  Be careful not to let Anniston's melancholy fool you into the thinking this is a drama.  She does a nice job here, but unless youre a &quot;Friends&quot; fanatic, that's not the real story.  &quot;The Good Girl&quot; is a creative comedy with good characters, such as John C. Reilly as Anniston's husband.  He is cornering the market on the well-meaning but dopey as s**t husband this year (&quot;Chicago&quot; as well).  His turn in &quot;Good Girl&quot; is richer than in &quot;Chicago&quot;, however, because his character isn't so one dimensional.  By the way, he got a Goden Globe nom. for &quot;Chicago,&quot; so if you want to see that part expanded upon, see &quot;Good Girl&quot; for added depth.  Jake Gyllenhall's (sp?) character is fun also.  He's a self-suffering, flatulent writer with deep, deep feelings, ie; testosterone.  <BR>There are no easy answers for Anniston's character in this movie, and there are no easy answers in real life.  The movie is unconventional and as a result, rewarding.<BR>The end of the movie may have seemed sudden or unrewarding to others, but trust me.  Just trust me.  The ending of &quot;The Good Girl&quot; is as beautiful, uplifting, and heartbreaking as I have seen in a movie.  Period.
B000002KET|4.0|Black Sabbath has always been an exploratory musical band, and they did plenty of experimenting on this album. A National Acrobat is brilliant, as it features Ozzy contemplating why God spontaneously aborts fetuses. Sabbra Cadabra and Killing Yourself to Live are the ultimate stoner songs. The album is not quite as good as some of the other Sabbath ones, but it holds it's own. It's quite a transition album between the more classical Sabbath Volume IV and the insanely brilliant Sabotage.
B0000026JR|5.0|I owned a copy of this classic way back in the day.  And I gotta tell you, this album still rocks!  I mean, from the first track (thundersteel).  All the way to (buried alive) its the real deal.  They just don't make albums like this anymore where every song is great. Bloodstreets) was the first track I ever heard off this bad boy. So anyone whoever you are, if you still long to jam out to some old 80's cheese.  Pick this one up and add it to your collection it still kicks!
B000002KDO|4.0|This legendary album follows the even more famous Paranoid, and it somewhat more upbeat in some songs. Unfortunately, like Vol. 4, it has some &quot;filler&quot; songs that just take up space. It's a must have, though, because of songs like Sweet Leaf, Children of the Grave, and Into the Void, the last song being the icing on the cake to the 60's antinuclear protest movement. Solitude is also a great acoustical guitar song. Obviously a must have for Sabbath fans.
B000000OR9|5.0|If I had to pick from just 5 of my all time favorite albums from the 80's hard rock era, this would be numero uno!  What a classic.  John Sykes really delivers the goods on this record.  He also didn't put any slouches behind him either Carmine Appice, Tony Franklin.  These guys just get done.  I remember hearing the first track ( Valley of the kings) like it was yesterday.  The hooks and riffs on all these tracks are just an awesome mixture of bluesy, Zepplenesque, fantasy rock songs you just don't get anymore.  An album that slipped under the radar as far as popularity or back then MTV's flavor of the week.  For those of us who can still appreciate this type of music you know what I mean when I say MTV killed an entire genre of killer music like this.  And that is why this is one you should not pass up.  Its well worth the 10 or 12 bucks!
0060987464|5.0|Marilyn Manson proves he is an intelligent, insightful man in this autobiography. It's fascinating!!! He is very well-written and talented. He has no illusions about himself; instead of asking for hero worship, Marilyn/Brian shows us his true face, admitting his weaknesses, calling things as he sees them, and being very open and honest about the events and people in his life and how they've affected him.<BR>I highly recommend this book for fans and non-fans alike. In fact, if you are not a fan and read this book, I'm betting you WILL be as soon as you've finished reading. Brian Warner has always been intense, even in youth, but he found a wonderful outlet for all his angst in his creation of Marilyn. His talent continues to grow and surprise; not only does he write the songs for his band, but he is a photographer and writer as well (check out his photos of his honey Dita Von Teese in Playboy [Nov I think]). He is a passionate, talented man and should not be discounted just because he chooses \\"darkness\\" as his platform. We all hide our darkness within; all of us are capable of being the anti-christ (you HAVE to read his definition of this - it completely makes sense!). It is to this part of our being that Marilyn speaks - and every single word is worth hearing.

0553812173|5.0|One of the great publishing crimes of the early twenty first century is being committed under your very noses; Steven Erikson's \\"Malazan Book of the Fallen\\" sequence is not being picked up by any publishers in the US.<br />This is in many ways appalling, while I applaud the fact that Amazon her eis importing these novels a major US publisher should be picking them up; why? Well probably because quite simply along with \\"A Song of Fire and Ice\\", Erikson's books are probably the best fantasy series available today. Admittedly this series is not for everyone, it's complicated, it's gritty and in places it's hard to follow. However it's worth the effort, Gardens of the Moon is a book that rewards the reader.<BR>There are no young boys who become kings, no princesses and definitely no quaffing of wine; instead we see a complicated war from the point of view of a platoon of foot soldiers. <br />If you're a fan of Eddings or Brooks and think they are great fantasy try Erikson then you'll find what real fantasy writing is about. Be warned though there are two competing story lines, the story in Book 1 here is only picked up in Book 3 \\"Memories of Ice\\". Books 2 and 4 involve a separate though linked story line.<br />Great Stuff!
B00005JLD2|5.0|Rabbit-Proof Fence is an amazing movie based on a dark period in Australia's history. Half-caste children are taken from their Aborigine mothers and raised in camps, with the goal of helping them make the transition from their \\"primitive\\" lifestyle to the white world. Although the camps are not horrible, the fact that the children/families have no choice is.<br />3 girls defy the system and escape. Their plan is to follow the rabbit-proof fence (that's being/been built across Australia) to get back to their home - 1200 miles away! The girls range from 8 to 14 years old. They find some help along the way but it's primarily their will to get back home that gets them through. What makes this even more amazing is that it really happened! In fact, the 14 year old made the trip twice after being returned to the camp after her first successful escape.<br />The movie avoids preaching about the wrongness of the Aborigine Act but, instead, focuses on showing the various sides of the story - the whites who honestly feel that they are helping the children, the whites along the way who help the girls even knowing that they have escaped, the Aborigine tracker who can't seem to find the girls despite his skills, and, of course, the children and families impacted.<br />Rabbit-Proof Fence reminded me of the Railway Children in the US - another story that should be told!
B00005JLSC|5.0|A movie complete with great music, great sets, great costumes, great dancing, great acting and fabulous stars to bring it all together to make it an outstanding movie.  One that I will see again and again.  I almost gave it a standing ovation, until reason prevailed and I realized I was watching a  movie, not a stage show.  Kudos to all who made this film possible!
B000069HKH|5.0|...Some of the reviews of this CD are horrible, I guess some people have no concept of human loss, you people are sick. Bruce is not capitalizing on other peoples misfortunes, he is just singing about that terrible day that everyone seems to want to forget.

0312305060|2.0|It is easy to see why some may find this style of writing to be pleasing or appeasing, but I found it to be neither. There are problems with this book, although it is not wholly awful.<BR>It is not an unenjoyable read, in fact it is quite 'easy' reading, but I was looking for more, considering the praise this book has accrued. <BR>The Hours reads like the product of a creative writing class, it is stacked full of stock technique and observation. He has attempted to emulate the style of Virginia Woolf, and has succeeded to a certain extent, but while that may have been avant-garde in 1923, eight decades later, it is rather twee. <BR>The author uses many clichd writerly tricks, and uses them too often; the \\"Here is ...\\" line just seemed to keep popping up in every chapter, over and over, sometimes twice on the same page. This was popular with Eliot in the twenties, and probably Woolf, too, but his endless repetition of this, and other stylistics, felt contrived, distracting and self-conscious.<BR>I am sure this was a difficult book to write (yet the echoes of Mrs.D seem rather formulaic), but it does not pull off, in any complete sense, an evocation of Virginia Woolf's life or work, and perhaps is not meant to. Perhaps it is meant solely as a glance, as if her shadow were to pass briefly over our faces, but, why then be so date-specific? Why then choose Woolf at all? <BR>Another problem. The Clarissa characterisation was thin and her sections were, oddly, filled with digressions into queer theory. This is fine, but the novel is not presented as a gay one, and it does not fit; these parts feels forced in. He should have saved this stuff for another book.<BR>I fail also to see why he chose Dalloway as the theme. It was a failed novel, we all know Woolf was unhappy with it, I'd rather have seen over her shoulder as she wrote Lighthouse or Waves, which were, as she knew, truly great works. Why focus on the morbid aspects of her life? Delight us instead with her brilliance!<BR>It has won awards and been made into a film, but the first two hundred pages of The Hours felt flat and unengaging. In the last twenty we are introduced to the simple, and Hollywoodesque, plot contrivance, the twist which he foreshadows and unfurls toward. It is admittedly gripping, but ultimately, left me with nothing and, writing this a couple of weeks after reading the novel, I really feel Cunningham has given very little of any substance with The Hours. <BR>The most thought-provoking element of this text is the echo of author to character and character to reader, which then plays back against the author: this all set up a clever Russian doll effect, as it were, but the characters could have been more real, had they not been confined by their plot constrictions. Interesting to read as it is so talked about, and better than most bestsellers . . . but The Hours takes itself, and asks to be taken, too seriously, and for this reason, fails.
B000002O1Q|5.0|This soundtrack is one of the most enigmatic accompaniments to a movie I know! It maybe the fact that the movie is my all time favorite but each song tells a story. None more than the epic &quot;Tonight Is What It Means To Be Young&quot;.  One of the strongest songs on the cd it will take you on an extensive journey and just when you think you have reached the end - theres more!<br />A great crew worked on the soundtrack - you wont be dissapointed<br />An absolute must buy cd for fans of the movie - but even if you havent seen it, the CD can certainly hold its own as a classic Rock album!
B00004XQ83|5.0|My CD collection, pre-O Brother, consisted of the likes of U2, REM, Smashing Pumpkins, Rage Against The Machine and other mainstream acts. The result of my watching this film was, apart from buying the soundtrack, purchasing Emmylou Harris' 'Red Dirt Girl', Allison Kraus + Union Station's 'New Favourite', Gillian Welch's 'Time The Revelator' and The Best Of Leadbelly. <br />All this does is confirm exactly what everyone says about this soundtrack, it changes you. It makes you realise that the music you currently listen to - as artistic and forward thinking as it may be - can never be as powerful as strong lyrics sung with the right voice and/or harmonies. Indeed, the majority of these tracks have only 1 instrument in the background (if any at all). <br />Have you ever seen a gospel choir and thought 'I wish I could get hold of collection of that music'? You can see how much they love what they are doing and its contagious. This compilation is just that type of album. You feel priveleged, even special when you listen to it. It makes you smile and it makes you wish that you could reproduce it. You could probably reproduce the music, but I bet that the thought of feeling a part of this music would render any average person unable to create the vocals - they would be grinning far too much to sing.
B000069AUI|5.0|Simply, Coldplay has amazing talent.  They have a sincerity that pours from each of their tunes.  If you want a CD to listen to that will help you think of serious things in your life this is a great soundtrack front to back for it.  This is the best album I've bought in better than 12 months.
B00005JKZT|5.0|I must say this is the best film I have ever seen...ok I've seen others that I thought was the best ever but that was before the LOTR came out. ;)  First the film cuts to the chase by opening with Gandalf fighting the Balrog, which is a very exciting scene to watch!  Basically everything begins excatly where it left off, Frodo and Sam making their way to Mordor, Aragorn, Gimli and Legolas tracking down Merry and Pippin.  Which I have to say is a very funny scene.<br /><br />Merry and Pippin kinda \\"grow up\\" in this one, in the last one they were kinda like goofy children but in this one they fend for themselves and realize that if they don't play some sort of part in this they will have no Shire to return to.<br /><br />Sam really becomes a stronghold for Frodo as the ring begins to take him. Frodo begins to take pity on Gollum afriad that he will turn out to be just like him.<br /><br />And Poor Gollum, I have to say I really felt for his character you can really see the inner turmoil and I'm glad he wasn't just created for comic relief, as a matter of fact I've never seen a CGI character as real and complex as he is.<br /><br />Gimli is the funniest ever!  But none of it takes away from the movie at all, his scenes with Legolas were the best and I'm glad more humor was brought to Legolas.  In the book he was a bit of a smart mouth (from what I can remember, I haven't read the books in a long time) and he was just that in the movie.  And I don't care if this will make me out to be a love sick puppy or not but he is one hot elf!!  If you need any other reason to see this movie besides it being \\"the best movie ever\\" just go to see Legolas! :)<br /><br />Aragorn was great as well!  I know a lot of ppl were worried about the whole love triangle thing but trust me when I say worry no more, it's not some crazy steamy in your face love scenes it's done very tastefully and it doesn't take away from the film at all.
B000066AXE|5.0|No wonder this movie won some awards, it's one of the best movies out there, end of story. The people that diss on this movie obviously don't know a good movie when they see one, and that is the truth. Russel Crowe's acting really shines in A Beautiful Mind, it's purely amazing. This movie will confuse you, there's no doubt in that. But once you get it it's a really good concept, that in the end turns into an awesome plot for the story. I won't tell you anything about what this movie is about, you'll have to watch it first. I highly recommend you ignore anyone who disses this movie, because no matter what they say they know absolutely nothing. Read the reviews that don't diss on this movie, because at least they state the facts. Get this movie when you can, or at least rent it.
B00006JJ1O|5.0|What can I say??? When I first heard \\"All the things she said\\" it was simply magic......the magic you get when you listen to a great song!! At first I opted to buy the single but the decided to borrow the cd from a friend and it was magic onece again. This is one of those albums you fall in love with every song!!The ballad \\"30 minutes\\" its breathtaking and there's also a great a great cover of \\"How soon is now?\\" <br />Take it from a new fan.....you are going to love this cd!!!!!!
B00005JKDR|5.0|Okay, it is a Disney movie (or Pixar, same thing--more or less) so you aren't going to sit down with your college buddies to watch the movie.  However, if you are looking for a quality DVD in regards to video quality and audio seperation, this DVD is a must have DVD.<br />II found myself getting tricked by this video as sounds came very distinctly from the rear right and rear left channels on several occasions throught the presentation.  The seperation is simply stunning.<br />The video portion is also something to note with high regard.  Each frame of the video is perfect with no lines of resolution visible even at close range.
0385508417|1.0|Not funny - whiney and annoying. By half way through I was so tired of the rude neighbors and other assorted characters and feed up with the whiney tone of the Kranks. I kept thinking &quot;So get on the stink'n plane and go away for crying outloud&quot;. Sorry, I normally am easily amused, but if this was supposed to be humorous I certainly didn't laugh.
B000002H6C|3.0|I have had this recording since its release. It sounds like old school Metallica but just doesn't have the impact of their first three albums. The songwriting is more complex but I also think that makes it sound more contrived. When I listen to &quot;Ride the Lightening&quot; I feel like the band's attitude was 'let's kick some rear but do it with a relatively high degree of sophistication where possible'. What I get from &quot;...And Justice for All&quot; is 'let's come up with a ton of polished riffs, arrange them like a guitar teacher at the local community college would, and add just a touch of political pretension to our lyrics.' The result is an album with moments of impressive musicianship but one that lacks the heart of earlier efforts. Of course, we who were there in the beginning now know the disaster that awaited with subsequent releases. Compared to post-Black Album Metallica, this is pure genius.
B0000507QH|4.0|L'Ennui is driven by a very clever idea and a curious understanding of the perverse quirks of human nature (and male sexuality.) It's classic male fantasy turned nightmare: an older man falls for a younger girl who is beautiful, naive, sexually voracious, and utterly pliant. It's a pornographic dream that gradually becomes more and more hellish to the middle-aged protaganist, who is disillusioned with life (the French call it \\"ennui\\"), and groping for some kind of meaning. For, ironically, the utterly sexually available girl cannot be possessed; she is utterly opaque, and because he cannot inhabit her mind, cannot make her feel intensely for him, he becomes neurotically obsessed by her, which, of course, leads to all kinds of abjection and abasement for him. In this, the film explores the tension between the male dream of feminine passivity, and the male nightmare of feminine impassivity.<BR>L'Ennui falters quite a lot; it's turgid, and probably forty minutes too long, hammering the point home long after the emotional terrain of the film has been traversed. Still, it's an intriguing film, often blackly funny, insightful, and, erotic in the way only French films dare to be, all jiggling flesh and too much reality for audiences reared on the smoothed over nothingness of Hollywood.
0066214122|2.0|I absolutely love Michael Crichton books, and have read almost all of them.  He is smart and technical and creative; what's not to like??  While Prey was very entertaining, its premise has such a severe disconnect that it took some of the fun out of it for me.  We are taught in Prey, that a man-made molecule (1 single molecule!) would take the brightest scientists in the world 3 trillion years to assemble, assuming they could assemble 1 million nanoparticles per second.  Statistically impossible.  Then we have a parallel story telling us that these nanoparticles themselves have figured out a way to do this, to assemble, reproduce, learn and develop.  Not just to do it, but to do it at alarmingly quick rates, like a few hours.  So the nanoparticle is smarter than the human.  No wait, they are WAY smarter than humans.  And we are supposed to not only accept this but to be amazed and terrified by the possibilities of nanoparticles evolving and taking over.  This is simply the logical conclusion to a faulty premise, the premise of evolution.  Evolution as a description of why we are on this planet, or as a world view, is scientifically bankrupt.  Primarily due to the fact Crichton mentions above, the time it would take the best scientists to build one molecule.  With the theory of evolution, we are supposed to believe this molecule generation has happened on an infinitely larger scale (the earth and universe), and in a very imperfect non-lab environment with no intelligent direction.  Just by chance out in the dirt and water.  Science itself proves that evolution is not science, but a belief system.  A belief system that with today's technology requires absolutely blind faith to believe, in spite of the laws of science.  It still was a fun read.  Just not as fun as it could have been if it was remotely possible.
0060523794|4.0|Being an IBM employee at that time and having lived though the first 6 months of Gertsner's reign, I see that Lou has chronicled quite accurately the events during the remaking of the New IBM and rationally explaining some of the decisions that were made at the time.  Its amazing how much bitterness still remains from those bloodletting days as shown in the previous reviews.  All in all though, despite the pains from the early days and the constant critiscms from both inside and outside of IBM, Lou has done a really good job as CEO and this book simply explains what was happening at the time and why some decisions were made the way they were made.  I give credit to where credit is due and I recommend this book to all former and current IBMers.
B00005Y1TL|5.0|A friend once asked me, &quot;If you could only listen to one CD for the rest of your life, what would it be?&quot;  I got some clarification on the question: One CD (2 or more disc sets don't qualify, unless you just choose ONE disc from the set), and it has to be something released - you can't make your own.<br />This is the disc I'd choose.<br />Why?  Music, to me, suits my mood or creates the mood I'm looking for.  It can alter my state of mind or conform to it, but I can't have something that conflicts with me.  This disc somehow conforms to or creates everything I want without ever conflicting.  It is never to fast or slow, harsh or smooth, bright or dark.  It makes for great background music, but you have to listen closely to hear everything it's telling you.  It just doesn't get old.<br />Hey, this is one of RDJ's discs that actually has track names, too, so download a couple and see for yourself.  Listen on headphones or some good speakers for a real experience.
B00005JL7Q|5.0|I was hesitant on seeing this, partly because I had never heard of it or seen reviews of it on TV before, but my mom reluctantly dragged me to the show to see it. Was I surprised.<br />Hugh Grant plays an amazing character, the male version of Bridget Jones, or so I think. His commentary throughout the movie at random points made me laugh, and I love the \\"SPAT\\" meeting. The boy in the film did an amazing job, and the bond that forms between him and Will is great. After I saw the movie, I bought the book, and both were equally impressive. No one could have played this role better than Grant, he's perfect for it. This is probably one of his best films, if not the best. <br />When it comes out on DVD, I strongly suggest getting it, or rent it first, and I guarentee you will love it. I was hesitant on seeing it, and I was extremely surprised and pleased!!!<br />The soundtrack is also amazing, done by \\"Badly Drawn Boy\\". I suggest getting it if you're a fan of the film, because every song in the film is on the soundtrack.
0151008116|5.0|I'm not here to write a long, tedious review on the defects or the affects of this book. My opinion: a novel deserving of its reward. A novel to appreciate and contemplate.

B00005OAIE|5.0|This, and 'After Everything Now This' by the great Australian band THE CHURCH, are my favorite releases of 2002.  Mayer is a top notch singer/songwriter, and this release is a quality class-act!  He is one of those 'once in a while artists' whose release stuns and amazes music lovers.  Run, do not walk, to your nearest music retailer and pick up copies of these two releases.  Long live John Mayer and The Church!
B0000683DH|5.0|\\"The Wrath of Kahn\\" is considered to be the best of the now 10-entry \\"Star Trek\\" film series, and for good reason.  The film successfully takes the most important and lasting aspects of the 1960's TV series and lovingly and carefully adepts them to the big screen.<br />Although a critical flow, \\"ST: The Motion Picture\\" made boffo box office bucks, and it's open-ended finale left room for a whole franchise.  But what has become clear after more than two decades is that if the second film flopped, \\"Star Trek\\" would have died.  Thankfully, it didn't, as the films gave birth to the superior \\"ST: The Next Generation\\".  Gene Roddenberry was moved to consultant status for the second film, and a new producer, Harve Bennett, took over.  Bennett and Co. crafted a script that was a sequel to the 1967 TV Episode \\"Space Seed\\", about the 20th-century, genetically engineered warlord Kahn.  The script has all the flourishes of what made the series so compelling: Sci-fi action that was really a human story at heart.  A story about revenge, aging, loss, and hope in the face of unrelenting evil.<br />To direct and help polish the script, Producer Bennett hired Nicolas Meyer, a virtually unknown director who was known more for writing one of the better non-Arthur Conan Doyle Sherlock Holmes Stories(The Sever-Per-cent-Solution), than anything else.  Meyer had never seen Star Trek before, but he quickly took to it, and the movie went into production.  The budget was not as lavish as \\"TMP\\", but the way this is handled is brilliant, as Meyer took the space opera of Trek and turned it into a naval excersize set in space.<br />The plot is well known-Admiral Kirk and the crew of the Enterprise are taking the ship on a training voyage filled with cadets.  Kirk is feeling old and lost as a Starfleet Adminstrator, and while he longs to return to the adventure of space, he seems resigned to the fact that his time in the Final Frontier is at an end.  Meanwhile, a survey mission sent to find a suitable planet on which to test the Genesis Device(A science experiement that can rebuild a desolate, lifeless world into a lush Eden)stumbles accross Kahn, still stranded 15 years after Kirk left him to forage for himself on the previously healthy world of Ceti Alpha V.  However, ecological disaster turned teh planet into a wasteland, killing many of Kahn's crew and his wife, all of which he holds Kirk responsible for.  Learning of Genesis and it's potential as a weapon, Kahn hijacks the starship Reliant and sets out to avenge himself on Kirk.<br />What follows is perhaps one of the greatest Sci-Fi Genre films ever made.  Kahn is played with remarkable ferocity by Ricardo Montalban, driven to madness by his desire for revenge.  Shatner gives his greatest performance ever as Kirk, tortured by his age and his growing sense of helplessness.  Nimoy is also excellent here, coming back to the better portrait of the Half Human/Half Vulcan Spock than he showed in his stiff performance in \\"TMP\\".  DeForrest Kelley and Kristy Alley also have great moments in this film, as Dr. McCoy and Vulcan Lt. Savvick, a protege of Spocks, respectively.  We all know what happens at the end, and it it powerful stuff.  Well-written and performed, the ending packs an emotional punch you rarely get in a Sci-Fi film.  Real feelings are on display, and the final scenes are touching and hopeful.<br />Regarding Meyer's decision to turn the film into Horatio Hornblower in space, this can only be regarded as genius.  The space battle scenes have a definite naval quality to them, and a claustrophobic, submarine-like quality is found in the final showdown.  The effects wizards at ILM did a superb job on their budget, and showed real care for the subject, and that comes through in one of the excellent special features on this DVD.  Also impressive is the story of how the film was made, from pre-script to post-production.  A final note on the score:  It's by James Horner, and it is fantastic.  Horner is ofcourse best known for Titanic, but here he creates a very martial score, echoing Meyer's change in tone from exploration to Naval.  Jerry Goldsmith's score in \\"TMP\\" is an excellent exploration score, and he found the right themes for that film.  Here, Horner finds the right grove for this movie.  It is a terrific accompaniment to what is happening onscreen, and Horner deserves praise for his efforts.<br />Overall, this DVD is a must-own for any serious Sci-Fi fan.  It is accessible to those unfamiliar with the series but interested in the genre, and it is of course welcome in any Star Trek fan's collection.  No other film in the series comes as close to capturing the ideals of the TV series than this one.  It is a fine achievement, and I give it a full recommendation.s of course best known for Titanic, but here he creates a very martial score, echoing Meyer's change in tone from exploration to Naval.

B00006LSM3|5.0|At first I was a little unsure about this album. ( Post life albums,tend to be sad affairs,and a bit lacking. ) But,I am happy to say,Dhani Harrison,Jeff Lynne,Jim Keltner,et.al,did a wonderful job of completing the finalized versions of these songs. Basically...it sounds like the wonderful hybrid of \\"Cloud Nine\\" and The Travelling Wilburys-era Harrison.( No surprise since Jeff Lynne worked on both. ).The songs are good,and very much George,and no whining about his lot in life. He accepted his fate,and went out singing! My favourite tracks are \\"Stuck Inside A Cloud\\",\\"Brainwashed\\" and \\"Between The Devil & The Deep Blue Sea\\".( George finally,plays his little ukelele for us!). I also enjoyed the instrumental \\"Marwa Blues\\",\\"Pisces Fish\\",and \\"P2 Vatican Blues\\". \\"Brainwashed\\" is a fitting finale,remniscent of another album finale,\\"Save The World\\",biting satire and a mystical chanting,as George ascends the turntable,and waves goodnight,Leo. Harrison fans will enjoy this release,and non-fans might find some things to like too. ( Although....the one complaint I have,is the art direction,I'd've prefered more images of Harrison,\\"Friar Park\\",and the band,instead of crash test manniquins. ) . Jai Krishna,Dear George!
0312305060|5.0|You'll either love this novel so much you'll read passages over and over, or you'll give up after a couple of chapters.  I think the reason so many people have problems with &quot;The Hours&quot; is that they don't enjoy reading a novel with such a dark mood.  Some people aren't entertained by reading about such tragic loneliness.  Cunningham deals with characters who who are depressed to the point of despair even when they are surrounded by people who love them unconditionally.  It's probably hard for most people who are reasonably happy to grasp that kind of pain.  The author's beautiful and sometimes poetic writing is an amazing work of art;  the novel deserved all the praise it received.  The way the story parallels Virginia Woolf's masterpiece &quot;Mrs. Dalloway&quot; is inspired.  The book truly takes the reader into the world in which Virginia Woolf lived her brilliant and tortured life, and the transitions from Woolf's era to those of Laura Brown and Clarissa Vaughn were beautifully done.  The best way to read this book is on a rainy day, classical music in the background and a pot of tea on the stove.  If only other novels could compare...
B000002MJC|1.0|Simply put, 4 and a half stars average rating is waaaaay too much for this thing.<BR>Now, I am a fan of the type of music DM (I'm looking at you, David) were supposedly \\"influenced\\" by while making this album. Shame then that instead of expanding on their influences like they did in the past, Depeche Mode ended up making some of the most absurd, contrived, forced songs of their whole career. I have no problems with the use of guitars or living, breathing drummers for a change. The songs though, are boring, uninspired and range from meh to ...<br />A lot of the songs on this album don't sound like the darker, more rock-driven sound that was supposedly picked up from the Seattle alternative era. What they actually remind me of is Creed-- SOFAD has the same type of never-ending half-melodies that go nowhere and are filled with over-the-top, woe-is-me singing and dramatic, cliche lyrics. Upon hearing stuff like \\"Rush\\", I can imagine Dave Gahan, hair blowing in the wind, falling off a cliff and taking 4 minutes to finally hit the ground. <br />I have actually heard people praise Dave's vocals on this album. For what? The weak half-roar he manages to attempt on I Feel You or the hoarse croaking on Condemnation (stop playing this song live, men, for the love of God!!).<BR>I *adore* the guy's voice, and it wasn't bad live during this era, but on the album, it just doesn't match his singing on the pre and post-SOFAD albums.<br />Walking in My Shoes is slightly better melodically than the majority of the other songs, but its lyrics resemble something a cheerleader would write on a bad day after having learned the word \\"repentance\\" at school. Come on.<br />Mercy in You, One Caress, Judas, Rush, Higher Love... they are all droning, never ending attempts at being heartfelt. It must be a matter of taste, sure, but as a Depeche fan who knows what these people are capable of on a good day, the songs make me cry for all the wrong reasons.<br />So, what happened?!?! I myself don't know... It's the ultimate letdown to have a row of brilliant and near brilliant albums (from Some Great Reward through Violator) and then have to sit through this. But I guess it's also human... I didn't stop loving DM after this, it's just an album I have no desire to own.<br />The only song I actually like on here is In Your Room. It has (*gasp*) great lyrics, great vocals, and an eerily beautiful melody although even this song has a flaw: I find that it reminds a bit too much of a second-grade Pink Floyd knock off. Still, it has managed to move me, and is the only thing worth listening to.<br />Try to get through the Babylon-blubbering \\"I Feel You\\" lyrics without laughing, I dare you! <BR>And someone please ... the backup singers!<br />:*(
B00005JL2O|3.0|It's hard to be hard on this movie, since I consider \\"The Spy Who Shagged Me\\" darn near a masterwork. But darnit, \\"Goldmember\\" just feels like a retread of earlier Austin Power gags, which second time around pretty much don't seem that funny.   It's hard to say why Mike Myers and director Jay Roach resorted to so much self plagerism, but listening to their side by side commentary provides a couple of clues.    Apparently the boys were playing it \\"safe\\", with Roach, thru-out the production, shortening or deleting certain scenes to \\"keep it moving\\" because test audiences weren't \\"getting it\\".    Now that sounds odd to me, because essentially we weren't supposed to \\"get it\\" in the first movie.  The popularity of Austin Powers was darn near a phenomenon.  But now that we do \\"get it\\", does this mean that we are in danger of not \\"getting it\\" subsequent times around?    And why have so much reliance on test audiences?  I'm surprised that Myers and Roach fell for the second guessing game and unfortunately it shows in this movie.  Roach also admits that he wasn't too keen on Goldmember, the character, and kept his screen time at a minimum.  But the out-takes of Myers goofing around with his \\"Goldmember\\" character are quite funny.  A few more choice scenes of Goldmember would have taken the movie up a notch.  So what if the humour is off-kilter and plainly bizarre.  Bring it on, please!  I am sadly going to be a bit wary of the fourth \\"Austin Powers\\", if there is one.
0380789019|4.0|I like Neil Gaiman.  His writing is deft yet fluid, always flowing through descriptions like the water in the sewer tunnels he creates in &quot;Neverwhere.&quot;  The concept is very interesting -- homeless people all over the world aren't really as homeless as they may seem... they craft societies and have fiefdoms and lordships, and these little societies mysterious hold people who are as young as infants, and as old as the Roman legions.  The ones that conquered Britain.<br />&quot;Neverwhere&quot; is a throughly enjoyable read.  Mystery, adventure, and suspense all rolled into one, from the benevolent angel Islington to the almost comical Mr. Croup and Mr. Vandemar... who are also scary and extremely creepy.  But &quot;Neverwhere&quot; doesn't flow quite as well as Gaiman's later novels, there are a few plotline hitches, occasionally the author seems to disbelieve himself what he's writing, and takes a bit before he goes back on track.  But this is indeed an excellent book, and I highly recommend it.  It's hard to put down, but not glued to your hand like &quot;American Gods.&quot;<br />In summary, I recommend this book, like I recommend any Gaiman novel.  Although it still goes into my library ranked below &quot;American Gods.&quot;
0375704027|4.0|I bought this book a long time ago, thinking it looked interesting, but it was probably two years before I actually got around to reading it.  When I did, I just about devoured it, not because it is the best book in the world, but because it captures a particular time so well, and the choices one comes to in building a life philosophy.  <br />Set in Japan in 1969 and 1970, it's the story of a young college student, Toru, and his \\"relationship\\" with a girl, Naoko, who was the girlfriend of his best friend, who killed himself a couple of years before.  Toru's life isn't charmed, but he's making it through, despite his shortcomings and mistakes.  Naoko has a harder time dealing with life itself, with her own and others' imperfections, and this inability to cope with the everyday eventually leads her down her own path.  Toru attempts to understand her, be there for her, and love her as best he can.  Being only 19 himself (at the beginning of the book), he's got a lot of growing up to do and decisions to make himself.  In the end, he probably makes the only decision he can make without going crazy himself, but this is also not without a great deal of sadness.<br />The one gripe I have about this book is that there is quite a few sex scenes...  This is played off, in part, to Toru's \\"craziness\\", but still was kind of weird.  What I did enjoy, though, was the description of the few people closest to Toru, his roommate, whom Toru has nicknamed \\"Stormtrooper\\", Toru's only \\"friend\\" in the dorms, this guy's girlfriend, Midori, Naoko, and Naoko's roommate.  Each is a different type of \\"crazy\\".  Some have even realized as much, and it's interesting to see how each character deals with that in themselves, and as it pertains to living with the rest of this crazy world.  And no, not everybody makes it.
B00006AFF5|1.0|Someone was smoking too much Who-Hash,when they decided to make this fiasco! I will give them credit for the visual side,it looks resplendantly Seussian! But,that's where it ends.The film cannot supply an entertainment to match the visuals. And the biggest part of the mess : Jim Carrey. Yes,once again,we are shown Jim's range: every character is a babbling schizophrenic. ( Worked for \\"The Mask\\",hasn't worked sinced. ). The make-up looks like a cross between a bassett hound and an alpaca,covered in green paint. Nowhere near as evil or frightening as the original drawings,or cartoon. Then there's the whimping out of the character. The Grinch can't just be evil,for the sake of evil,there's 90 minutes to pad out folks,no....now he's worried about ecology,family,unrequitted love,and the commercialization of Christmas. ( Maybe the writers were trying to kill two birds by creating a Grinch-Charlie Brown hybrid? ). Puh-leez. The Grinch was mean,for the sake of meanness,we don't need a psychological overhaul,to make him \\"accessable\\" to the \\"modern audience\\". The Boris Karloff version lives on,because it was straight forward,with no use for cute-i-fication. ( And yes,Jimbo even makes a complete mess of the \\"Grinch Song\\". ). A more interesting version,would've featured,say, Dennis Hopper or Christopher Walken as The Grinch. ( Someone who would turn good...but still seem evil. ). The three words that best describe this film are,and I quote,\\"Stink! Stank! Stunk!\\"

B00003W8NM|5.0|'Fight Club' is definitely a film you either identify with, or identify against.  Within the story is a portrayal of the modern everyman going through life in a self obsessed daze with limited resources.  Ed Norton plays the worker bee of cubicle trask researching auto-accidents for an auto company contemplating recalls for their mistaken engineerings.  Being surrounded by death trivialized by corporate economics he loses his identity and longs to have his life taken (portrayed in an amazing fantasy plane crash scene).  He then meets one of the motivators out of his dull, cloisted life - Tyler Derden (Brad Pitt) who is a self styled, enigmatic, charismatic rebel creating designer soap using discarded fat from liposuction clinics.  Together these two team up to revive men from their modern, materialistic malaise in society and return them to lively, combative, comradeship in socialist fight clubs that sweep the country and turn into Derden's personal tool to destroy the materialistic world that holds men in financial and emotional paralysis.<br />On the inside of the special edition booklet and box are many slags from popular press against the movie and the X-generation by old, out of touch critics from less contemporary eras.  This is a modern tale for the modern everyman surrounded by images and objects portraying lifestyles we will never be able to obtain.  Men caught in a world outside their control, and immasculated by pop and industrial culture.  Either you live this life and instantly identify strongly, or are priviledged beyond the frustrations of western culture and find the statements and actions, implied and stated, as brutal, nonsensical, and ridiculous.  'Fight Club', for the empathetic, provides an ideal fantasy of escape, tribal ritual, acceptance, organization and achievement under the guise of greater good while utilizing animalistic, hostile methods.  Almost every scene in the movie is littered with this kind of double meaning, and obfuscated morality that can easily repulse and intrigue the viewer.  The most validating message is that the pathetic everyman caught in this whirl of ambitious reorganization of male power is actually the uberman who makes it happen; saying anyone has the power to change the world for better or worse.  Finch, Palachniuk, Pitt, Norton and the rest of the cast and crew combine for powerful acting, dialogue, cinematography, editing and story that creates one of the most memorable and insightful celluloid statements of the 90's.  Not the perfect film, but damn close.
1878424319|5.0|This book was amazing. It changed my life! I read the entire book in one day and I cannot even begin to tell you what a transformation has occured with me. The Four Agreements may seem simple to follow but they are not. You definitely learn self discipline with this book. As time passes the agreements are easier to follow and soon they just come naturally. A truly amazing book. A MUST READ![.]
B00005RY7X|5.0|If you want to get pumped up toss this in your player and you won't come down for days. <br />Best album ever made but for instant gratification listen to song 11 (I get Wet) and you are in heaven. Go see him live it will be the time of your life.
B00006IU73|5.0|Porcupine Tree is ready to break into the mainstream, and this album is their towering statement, the musical equivalent of a huge exclamation point.  On their major label debut, the band has delivered one of their best efforts yet.  The brilliance of this album is that it retains the experimental, slightly left-of-center art-rock roots which Porcupine Tree has always thrived on, yet manages at the same time to be infectiously accessible to almost anyone who likes rock music.  Principle composer/frontman Steven Wilson manages this by offering a dense, dark mix of aural soundscapes and catchy pop hooks, hard-hitting walls of guitar distortion and delicate acoustic passages all thrown into a skillfully chaotic and beautiful work that ebbs and flows with a life of its own (and is further brought to life by the superb production - the echoing \\"pop\\" of Gavin Harrison's snare drum is alone worth the heightened production costs).  Catchy rock songs such as \\"Blackest Eyes,\\" \\"Trains\\" and \\"Prodigal\\" that all scream \\"hit single\\" fit within the context of the album as a whole while simultaneously standing alone as excellent songs in their own right.  Wilson had spent PT's last two albums honing his songwriting craft into a carefully balanced dance between experimentalism and accessibility; on In Absentia his craft evolves even further such that he no longer has to compromise between the two.<br />Every masterpiece has its flaws, and In Absentia is no perfect album.  \\"Wedding Nails,\\" a manic heavy metal instrumental in the vein of Rush or early King Crimson, feels distinctly out of place between the wonderfully moody ambience of \\"Gravity Eyelids\\" and soothingly depressing \\"Prodigal.\\"  It's like Dream Theater without the pretentious virtuosity, and it doesn't work as well in the studio as it does on stage.  The same could be said about \\"The Creator Has a Mastertape,\\" an otherwise perfectly passable work of speed metal which is wedged between the stunningly gorgeous works \\".3\\" and\\"Heartattack in a Layby.\\"  Still, Wilson and co. have once again done a good job of making a cohesive album out of so many disparate moods.  \\"Strip the Soul\\" comes at a perfect point on the album, a powerful finishing hook punch to the hard-hitting jab of \\"Blackest Eyes.\\"  In all, Porcupine Tree's music continues to defy most categorization beyond simply calling them \\"rock.\\"  Because this is the only label to which they lovingly cling, they have the utmost potential to appeal to any fan of the entire broad spectrum of the word...
0151008116|5.0|Literary, Lyrical, Fantastical, Magical, Memorable.<br />Unbelievably brilliant, this is one of the best books I've read in a decade.  Truly memorable, Martell has created a new fable, a fantastical tale, an epic journey of survival both mental and physical, a character/narrator that is destined to become a cultural and literary icon.<br />If you think Harry Potter was a children's book that adults could also enjoy, then this is the truly brilliant work of literary grandness that can be enjoyed by a child, a young adult, as well as an adult.  Should be required reading in every 8th grade reading class.  Pangs of the wonderful writing grace of Shirley Jackson; elements reminiscent of The Odyssey; memorable characterization as destined for classic as Holden Caulfield.<br />Written in a sequence of 100 short chapters, LIFE OF PI is the perfect book for a parent and child to read (or read out loud) together.  Make this book a special event in your life.  Because once you start reading it, it will be.  Take turns with your child reading each chapter and hand the book back and forth.<br />But never mind the kids.  Read it, adults.  The story and character are as memorable as any you've read.<br />I'm not giving anything away.  I can't put my hardcover on a shelf.  I'm desperately trying to give it to my friends to make them read it.  It's that kind of book you'll go back and buy more copies of and give them away to the ones you love.
B00007BH5C|5.0|This is a great soundtrack. I really like the lamenting chants in some of them, especially track 8, &quot;Evenstar&quot;. I also like the violins. As I was looking through the little booklet at some of the lirycs, I noticed the title of one, &quot;The Missing&quot;, the only problem is that it is missing. Where is it? It showed it written in Old English and also the translation but I can't find the song and it's not listed with the tracks, and I would really like to hear it.
B00005JKZT|5.0|A year ago when I saw LoTR: FotR, I was completely blown away.  I'd never read Tolkein but I do enjoy many things derived from his works (Dungeons and Dragons being one of them), and I must say I couldn't get enough.  After the DVD came out I watched it nearly every day, and after the extended edition came out I did the same.  So, at the Two Towers loomed, I drooled in anticipation.  I waited in line for 30 minutes to get into that movie (as opposed to the 2 hours I waited to see The Phantom Menace which, in my opinion, was not nearly worth waiting that long) and when I got in I trembled.  After watching sub-par trailers (X-Men 2 being the only beacon of hope; expect ... trailers about a tooth fairy, some Disney movie, Pirates of the Carribean [WTF] and Terminator 3 [keeping in mind that James Cameron's Terminator is moving on now without James attached at all]) the movie jumped right in, and the Tolkein geeks applauded.  <BR>     Two hobbits continue en route to Mordor to destroy the One Ring, Two other hobbits are carried off by walking trees (a notion that seemed ridiculous at the beginning, but made OH so much sense by the end) and the remainder of the fellowship joins the people of Rohan in a desperate struggle to fend off Saruman's army at Helm's Deep.  Frodo (Masterfully played by Elijah Wood) continues to shoulder the burdens of the evil that bearing the One Ring despite the fact that he is tired and looks extremely worn - a notion that Jackson and co. convey perfectly.  Samwise (Sean Astin) continues to be Frodo's balance and friend, and in my opinion the best actor in the films so far.  The two are joined by Gollum, and I have 2 things to say of this performance.  One, anyone who says that 'he looks real' is wrong; he is CGI through and through.  Two, the performance that Andy Serkis gives for Gollum is nothing short of Oscar-worthy.  Brilliant.  WETA and Serkis both deserve awards for bringing a very real and dark life to the screen in Gollum.<BR>     Meanwhile, Aragorn (Viggo Mortenson), Legolas (Orlando Bloom), and Gimli (John Ryhs-Davies) Pursue Saruman's evil orc soldiers into Rohan after Merry and Pippin.  They get tangled in the struggle to save Rohan and her people from Saruman, and the climatic battle is fought at Helm's Deep.  One shot before the Helm's deep sequence sums it up for me; when Merry and Pippin are riding atop TreeBeard the Ent, and see the armies leaving Isengard; I let out a loud when I saw the sheer size.  The Battle at Helm's Deep was spectacular, and for not a moment were my eyes not glued to the screen (At first light on the 5th day, look to the east - that was awesome).<BR>     Now, I am in no regard a Tolkein purist and have never even looked at the books.  In defense of and in opposition to Tolkein purists I say the following:<BR> - Reading your reviews tells me that Faramir's character was not supposed to be what it was and that he instead releases Frodo, Sam, and Gollum on their path to Mordor; I think Tolkein's intent to show that there are men that are worthy of nobility, but Jackson and co. want to focus the nobility of men on Aragorn and Aragorn alone, so I think that's why they did it.  <BR> -   I am not sure why Jackson wanted to hold this until the Return of the King, I think ending the film right after that would have made the darkness and anticipation even moreso for those who have not read the books (like myself).  I mean, leaving both the book (as I understand it anyway) and the film versions of FotR not knowing if Gandalf was really alive helped alot, and doing the same to Frodo would have been a boost.<BR> - Finally, I am a published author, currently adapting my works to screenplay to see if I can get a studio to bite.  All of your arguments about not being faithful to Tolkein's written texts are founded because you want to see everything up there; but take it from someone who knows, you cannot make a mirror of a book for the screenplay.  It just wouldn't work.  Studiosand screenwriters have to change elements to make it more appealing to the movie-going audience, and they have to either heighten those scenes that add drama and intensity, or they have to change or delete those scenes that just don't serve the story.  You can take as long as necessary to read a book, but filmmakers cannot take so long.  They have to convey the story that you maybe took a week to read into a couple hours.  Trust me, it just isn't possible.  So, try not to be too hard on Jackson and Co.; they did a fantastic job and made films that are unbelievably good.
B00006RU5B|4.0|My feelings about Audioslave's debut are mixed - on one hand, much of it sounds exactly like what you'd expect from a marriage of Rage Against the Machine and Soundgarden. About half the songs sound like they could have been Rage songs with just Chris Cornell singing over them instead of Zack de la Rocha screaming, and though the other half does show a bit more depth than most Rage material, it still doesn't really do anything new. It's all straight-ahead, old fashioned, bluesy hard rock. It sounds intentionally retro to me, and not at all groundbreaking or even new. <br />At the same time, while it breaks no new ground, it's undeniably well done. A lot of the songs on the album are simply good songs (&quot;Like a Stone,&quot; so ambiguously derivative, yet so irresistably catchy, is an example of this). At times you'll swear you're listening to the original Led Zeppelin, only with better production technology and some new guitar effects, and I think this may have been one of their aims. If so, they revive the spirit of Zeppelin very effectively. In short, this album could have easily been released in 1973. The only songs that sort of break the mold are &quot;Gasoline&quot; and the final piece, &quot;The Last Remaining Light,&quot; which sounds a lot like Soundgarden more than anything else.<br />Those looking for the virtuosic performances of classic Rage and Soundgarden will be (and have been, apparently) disappointed.  Tom Morello showed us that he has chops on Rage Against the Machine's debut album; here he sticks to his simpler, more experimental effects-laden solos of later Rage.  Chris Cornell keeps most of the songs within his lower &quot;Black Hole Sun&quot; style vocal range, and when he does stretch out to the upper register, his voice is startingly rough, though he still hits every note strongly.  I do, however, prefer his introspective and sensitive lyrics to de la Rocha's pretentious politicism.  Mostly, the album is filled with solid but short of outstanding performances.  And that's what this album is: solid but not outstanding, a good debut delivered with confidence and a strong spirit of classic hard rock, but one that is ultimately grounded in its own desire to remain true to its influences.  Audioslave has given us proof that they have the ability and the talent to give us a masterpiece; this just isn't it.  I, for one, do hope and expect that will come.
0066214122|4.0|I could not put this book down (As much as I hate saying that hackney phrase).  It was a thriller from beginning to end.  Much like Mary Shelley's Frankenstein, Crichton's Prey details the problems associated with man myopically creating a technology with reckless abandon for its current or future consequences.  When man finally does realize what he has created it is unfortunately too late, and he cannot bring it back under control.  In this case, the technology has to do with nano-technology and the protagonist is Jack Forman.
6302797535|5.0|\\"Murder by Death\\" is one of those gems that has been overlooked thru time.  Usually when I ask someone if they've ever heard of it most of the time they say, \\"no\\".  When I show them the movie they fall in love with it.  It's not complicated whatsoever.  Just listen carefully or else you will miss some of the more subtle jokes.
B00003CWL6|5.0|This film is talking about ¡°The beauty¡± as we can know from the title. It states what the beauty is that we think about, through the characters in the film. Lester who works sincerely in his place of work for a long time, his wife Carolyn who is a realtor and his daughter Jane who is a cheerleader in high school, they look all quite normal and ordinary outwardly. It is an appearance of the middle class citizen in America who has a nice car and house. However, it is only an outward figure. Lester is in constant fear when he would get fired by his firm, Carolyn feels embarrassed not to sell the house for several months and Jane is fed up with her boring life. <br />One day a family, which moves into the next their house, is similarly circumstanced. Frank who is a colonel in the U.S. Marine Corps, collects the Nazi-shape carved plates and guns as his hobby, and always keeps watch on his son excessively. His son, Ricky always conducts odd things such as taking a photograph a dead bird or the next house in secret or a vinyl bag, which is blowing in the wind. In addition, he sells marihuana even smokes together with Lester. Ricky¡¯s mom, Barbara is also abnormal. <br />Like this the characters in this film have some problems unlike their outward appearance. They appear to be peaceful externally, but internally they do not know that they are holding a bomb, which can explode sooner or later. After all, this bomb¡¯s wick begins to be caught on fire as Jane¡¯s friend, Angela shows up. In the end, this bomb destroys two families completely at the last part of this film. Since Lester becomes to be attracted by Angela, this family that will blow up some day, collapses and his dangerous relationship with his wife and daughter is shattered. <br />As far as I can see, this film seems to express that the beauty just cannot be called and judged as its exposed outward aspect. The things that Ricky films, especially, the shape of vinyl, which waves in the wind at the fallen leaves street, it seems to imply that hidden meaning. The implications about the beauty that people do not think, feel and see as conventional wisdoms, the director express it from this film. This film begins with Lester¡¯s narration and ends with his death. A remarkably frank script, outstanding direction and brilliant performances, on the whole, it is a well-matched film.
0446310786|5.0|As long as prejudice and injustice exist, the commentary in \\"To Kill A Mockingbird\\" will remain relevant and a tool by which we might be able to mend. Author Harper Lee, who earned a richly deserved Pulitzer Prize for literature, once said she never thought of her novel as nothing more than a love story of a widowed father for his two children. The novel is so much more. Intentionally or not, it is a searing indictment of the individual and institutional racism as seen through the eyes of southern lawyer Atticus Finch's daughter, Scout. Written in the innocent words of a child, we see unfolding a white woman's fabricated cry of rape against a black man and the cursory trial trial in which, considering it's the South and a black man is on trial for a crmie against a white victim, the proceedings are little less than perfunctory. As defense counsel, Scout's father endures the disdain of the white community in his lazy southern town. The fate of the defendant, predictable in the then-racist South, is no less heartbreaking and, at the same time, outrageous. Along with racism, the novel touches on people not fully understood, and the character of Boo Radley serves the point masterfully. An American classic in every sense of the word, \\"To Kill A Mockingbird\\" is a moving experience that, if we read closely enough, compels us to look beyond the prejudices and discrimination in our own hearts. It is a stunning masterpiece, and anyone who's felt a pang of discrimination ought to be required to read this one.
1572510714|4.0|Kurt Vonnegut's book Slaughterhouse Five is a unique and interesting anti-war book.There has never been a book written quite like this one. The story doesn't unfold like most other stories. It takes place in a series of different times and places. The places are Dresden, Iliam New York, and an alien planet to mention a few. The main theme of the book is very clear even if the time and places that it takes place in isn't. That theme is war is pointless and so is life sometimes. The constant changing of time and place give the reader a very exciting and adventurous ride through the life of Billy Pilgrim. The story is told in a new way giving it a fresh life. If you ever find the time to read a Kurt Vonnegut book this should be the one. It is truly original and creative with a dark sense of humor that appeals to almost anyone.
B000002UDD|4.0|Much stronger than Peaces sells, So far,, is a good start to getting into this band.  I recommend this over 'Peace sells' because the quality of the tunes is much higher.  To my liking 'PS' doesn t even deserve a rating.  Anyhow, this album is good.  The entire thing is good.  'Into the lungs of hell' gets it off to an excellent start (instrumental), then Set the world afire bursts into awesome guitar work by D Mustaine and J Young.  Anarchy in the UK follows; very strong and PUNCHY.  Track 4 Mary Jane A +.  Then In my darkest hour, 'liar' and hook in mouth.  And lets not forget 502.<br />A + album.  I don think Megadeth reached the level of playing they did here.  In Rust in peace they came close, but this was my FAVORITE Megadeth line up.  Get this.<br />Enjoy of course : )
0446608955|4.0|Even though a lot of people have dismissed the movie version of this book as overly mushy and predictable, I must admit, I was really drawn into it. There were just so many sweet things Landon did for Jamie, it was enough to make me cry. You could say I developed an attachment to everything about A Walk To Remember.<br />Now about the book, it was pretty different from the movie, but it basically has the same gist. Still enough to make me cry. :)

0060278269|5.0|Abhorsen is the long-awaited conclusion to the trilogy that began with Sabriel and Lirael. While Sabriel was a stand-alone novel, Lirael and Abhorsen are clearly two parts of one large book. In Abhorsen, Nix continues his gripping plot, unique world, and intriguing characters. Though few new characters are introduced in Abhorsen, the main characters from Lirael continue to grow and mature and keep the reader's interest. I highly recommend this trilogy to both children and adults. I had this book on reserve before it was available and I was not disappointed. I reread the first two books with enthusiasm and then thoroughly enjoyed the series' fitting conclusion.
B000002HD5|5.0|Gentlemen, the Afghan Whigs' pinnacle record, remains one of the most solid albums of the `90s. The quartet is in high form, almost flawlessly, and produces a collection of songs that stir, shock, calm, and amaze from start to finish.<br />I could rant and rave, but I won't. I'll point out some of the best tracks, though...<br />\\"If I Were Going\\" is a great opening tune, building up to a emotional high-point before launching into the next track, the powerful title track. \\"Be Sweet\\" is a signature Whigs song, moving from sublime verse to blistering chorus, all with a slight R&B sock to the jaw. \\"What Jail is Like\\" is mind-blowing (with a great feedback/piano combo), and \\"My Curse\\" (with Scrawl's Marcy Mays on vocals) is raw enough to crack the CD case. Finally, the cover of Tyrone Davis' \\"I Keep Coming Back\\" is simply stunning.<br />Are there any downsides? A few, but their so unnoticable that it really won't matter. For some reason, the closing instrumental doesn't send the album out well (even though it's a fine song as is). This minor error is quickly forgotten, though, by the everything else that's done well on the album.<br />If you want to own one of the most underrated, amazing records of the past decade, pick this up. You won't be disappointed.
0515127485|4.0|I was very eager to read Archangel, both on the strength of its premise and on the basis of Harris' prior work. His earlier novel Fatherland is a true classic that manages to be both suspenseful, dramatic and intellectually provocative.<br /><br />Archangel is a strong work of fiction, but it is not on the same level as Fatherland. Still it is worth recommending in its own right.<br /><br />Where Archangel succeeds is in atmosphere. There is something profoundly and distinctly haunting about Stalin's legacy, and Harris manages to evoke the ghost of the \\"man of steel\\" quite well. We are treated to vivid depictions of Moscow and the forested Russian North. Harris does pose a number of troubling points about Russia and Stalin's legacy - what does it mean that a considerable fraction of the Russian public celebrate the life of this monster?<br /><br />Archangel follows the adventures of a struggling British academic, Fluke Kelso, as he pursues Stalin's lost journal. The plot has not nearly as many twists as Fatherland, and the degree of suspense is somewhat less. The tone is, on the whole, far more mysterious. Noone should pick this up expecting a work with a lot of violent action.<br /><br />I'm not certain how I come down about the book's ending. It seems to fit the novel, and yet I was somehow expecting a bit more.  Nonetheless Archangel is a very good novel with a strong sense of history and setting, well worth your time.
B000060MY6|4.0|It's easy to write off this film as another incomprehensible David Lynch movie since it has all the hallmarks of one (vicious thugs who rely on almost random violence; apparently disconnected scenes; numerous, cryptic visual clues; dialog that appears to have been \\"inspired\\" by years of uninspired Hollywood fair; mysterious characters who not only appear out of the gloaming but promise to return; recurring characters with shifting identities; lesbian sex; smoking and mystery) and the plot isn't one subject to easy interpretation.  Strangely, while the film is enigmatic from the start, the first two thirds are deceptively linear:<br />Betty is an annoyingly perky Hollywood hopeful.  Rita is an amnesiac who crawls out of a limo involved in an accident - narrowly avoiding being murdered by its driver.  The two meet when Rita sneaks into Betty's aunt's house.  The two fall in love, with Betty and Rita turning into detectives in the Nancy-Frew mould to uncover Rita's true identity.  Meanwhile, a director is intimidated into casting a starlet named Camilla in his new movie.  Betty, who appears more blonde than Sandra Dee, manages to blow everybody away with her screen test.<br />And then, it begins to go awry.  The movie changes gears - the scenes seem more dream like and illogical, but Lynch gives us more clues.  And most importantly, the characters seem to change identities completely.  Rita becomes the much-desired Camilla.  The much-desired Betty becomes the blowsy Diane, a one-time Hollywood hopeful whose dream ended when she lost a part to Camilla.  Although still dream-like, the latter part of the film is so bleak and dispiriting that we're supposed to think it a dream more routed in reality than the beginning - with Betty's hopes and dreams becoming Diane's unachievable desires.  In the second part of the film, Camilla is Diane's former lover - an affair that Diane is incapable of maintaining in her imagination (even the dream Camilla dumps Diane; when Camilla andDiane meet again, it's at dinner party where Camilla and Adam are about to announce their engagement).  Diane's home is an empty husk - she lives alone and never seems to leave, except when she brings a wad of cash and Camilla's picture to a hitman.  Between the dreams of hope that open this flick and the nightmares of memories that won't die in the latter half, the characters seem menaced by a blue box.  (IMNSHO, the box symbolizes TV, a wasteland for those who couldn't match their dreams for movie stardom - the big plot and character shift occurs when Rita opens the box, and is sucked inside; Because Lynch makes MD an obvious elegy to a lost Hollywood, TV becomes an obvious avatar of its demise and its character's pain).<br />Though cryptic, it's not quite incomprehensible, and you and your friends can probably come up with dozens of your own spins on this flick's loopy twists (and you should bring along a friend - loneliness becomes very palpable here).  Despite the film's consistently cryptic and creepy atmosphere, Lynch manages to work some real pain out of his dreamy characters.  My favorite scene is the dinner-party scene in which we see Diane become a seemingly bottomless reservoir of pity (we see how unreachable Camilla has become to her, and we also learn that it was Camilla who essentially beat Diane to stardom).  Lynch has managed to bring some of the pathos of \\"The Straight Story\\" to his trademark world of nightmares and all-nite-diners.
B000066NW0|3.0|This record is basically a bunch of recycled pop ballads that were ripped from Alanis Morrisette and other pop artists. They are sung by a girl who is only signed because she is beautiful when she puts on a bunch of makeup. The songs would be good, but they have very little origionality.<br />The reason I give this album 3 stars is because it is the album that threw the last punch at the crumbling tower that is punk rock. Punk is dead people. Punk is now pop music. Hopefully this will kick dirt in the eyes of those ignorant branwashed punk rockers. <BR>For some real music kiddies listen to these artists: <BR>The Dillinger Escape Plan<BR>Graveworm<BR>Astor Piazzola<BR>...And Oceans<BR>Sigur Ros<BR>Have a nice day.

B000066NW0|2.0|I have to admit that I was totally into \\"Complicated\\" and \\"Sk8er Boi\\" but wasn't rushing out to buy this album.Then,this past Christmas,I purchased this CD for my 9-year old sister who is big Avril fan(she even bummed some ties from my uncle and wore them to school-it was very embarassing!).My sister loves it and plays it all the time.Just today,I finally decided to give this CD a try.Big mistake.The only songs I could listen to the whole way through were the two singles I mentioned above and even they are annoying now.The lyrics are somewhat childish and annoying(which is prehaps why my sister enjoys it).The worst song on the album is by far \\"Nobody's Fool\\" in which Avril tries to rap.Yes,you read that right.She tries to RAP.Well,let me say that she is no Eve or 'Lil Kim.Avril has the vocal ability but needs better songs and needs to drop her \\"Skater-punk\\" image.I respect that she writes her own songs but frankly,they are too childish for me.If you want a good album I suggest you pick up Christina Aguilera's \\"Stripped\\".

B00005V3Z4|5.0|I give this movie 5 stars because it is original. Each time I watch it, I sink deeper into Donnie's mind. I think that there are alot of people, young people, out there that are somewhat like one of the many characters in the movie. I never knew why I thought so much about life, I often thought I was strange, and then I saw &quot;Donnie Darko&quot; and I noticed that I am not the only one that sometimes thinks &quot;too much&quot; about things(although of course his thoughts consumed him). I think that also alot of people are like Chanita,a round, plump,but adorable young asian girl who is picked on. Also people are like Gretchen,a teenage girl with a good heart but hurts of her own. I think that this film was wonderfully directed,not perfect, but great. I believe that Jake Gyllenhaal is an adorable and talented actor, sometimes I watch this movie to see his work. I recommend Donnie Darko for those who are dreamers.Those who are not just walking on the earth without a thought or observation about our world.If you do not have a capacity to think and do not have huge capacity for imagination then I do not recommend this because the point of the movie and the intellect of the movie will not be absorbed the way I personally think(opinion) it should be and was intended to be.

B00004XONN|5.0|What can you say about Radiohead's latest release 'Kid A'? Despite the fact that there are no singles, no videos, and the band has performed few interviews and/or television appearances in recent months, the album hit number 1 in its first week on the market. In fact, the only promotion consisted of 30 second internet clips. <br />      An explanation of this approach (one that likely gave the record executives at EMI nervous fits) is in order. Radiohead's previous release, 'O.K. Computer', as far as many critics were concerned, marked a revival of creative rock in an otherwise dull period in the genre. Seemingly overnight Radiohead became the most hyped rock band in the world. Media and critics alike thrusted upon them the title 'saviors of rock' and the leading band members were quickly vaulted into celebrity status. However, instead of basking in triumph, this period marked a very uneasy time for Radiohead. Their video tour documentary 'Meeting People Is Easy' says a lot about the band's mentality during this period. In the video they adamantly denied the preconception that they are a guitar band, and seemed uneasy with their role in shaping rock history. The documentary shows their international touring schedule becoming a nightmare of methodically jumping from city to city and interview to interview. Even worse for Radiohead, the now large stadium venues crushed any intimacy that the band had with its audience. <br />      'Kid A' in some ways represents the band's response to all of this. The album defies rock traditions: standard verse/chorus formation is all but forgotten; many of the songs don't even feature guitars at all; others have no drums. Has all typical rock melody and style become an embarrassment to Radiohead? It would seem so. And in a related development, the band also has recently announced that they will be touring North America next year under a large pavilion tent! (check the official web-site for details) Certainly it would seem that Radiohead just wanted to do things as differently as possible in order to avoid the chaotic lifestyle that followed 'O.K. Computer'. Fortunately due to the enormous success of that album, Radiohead were given complete liberty in their next album's creation, including free reign on timing. The band was also finally given a year off after non-stop touring, studio, and interviews since the early 90's when they first hit it big. This freedom and space gave Radiohead time to reflect on themselves and their wishes for the future of the band. <br />      The release of 'Kid A' reflects this period and marks a new beginning for Radiohead. They now had to go about their creative process in a new manner - learning the studio equipment in new ways, experimenting with new instruments, sounds, and song structures. Ed O'Brien (guitarist /singer) in his online dairy has written about their approach to recording in the studio. He discusses how the band had to throw away their preconceptions about recording an album, including all the methods that worked for them before, because they knew they would never yield new results. The challenge for Radiohead being essentially to start over again, and to do it well. <br />       When first listening to the album it is important that you hear it as a complete work, start to finish. Some songs flow immediately into others (reminiscent of 'Dark Side of the Moon') and your impressions of them are directly affected by the preceding song. The album just doesn't seem to have the same emotional effect when the songs are heard in isolation. It is difficult to describe the impression that the album makes on the listener and will, in all probability, effect each person differently. To use a cliché, the album represents an expression of inexpressible feelings. The music seems to stimulate the sub-conscious mind and, in the end, leaves the listener feeling emotionally exhausted. But this is just as true lyrically as it is musically. Thom Yorke (singer/guitar/piano/song writer) has said that some of the lyrics on the album were literally pulled out of a hat. During the period after 'O.K. Computer' Thom wrote down various verses and thoughts which he couldn't organize into a whole, he then cut them up randomly, yanked them out of a hat and sang them during jam sessions. This apparently produced some great results. However it is impossible to find any objective meaning within them, they are just subconscious notions which sound interesting together and as a result create a bizarre effect on the listener. <br />      Musically there are many highlights and memorable moments on the album. In fact one of the great aspects of the work is the diversity that is found between each of the songs. Especially to note is the 9 piece brass band on 'The National Anthem' which is reminiscent of a traffic jam in downtown New York City; the serene and innovative string section in 'How to Disappear' (composed by Jonny Greenwood the 'guitarist' in the band); the bizarre time signature(s) in the jazzy yet haunting 'In Limbo'; and the break beats and layered vocals on 'Idiotec'. There are many other great moments on the album which are worth mentioning but perhaps would destroy the excitement of discovering them for yourself. If nothing else 'Kid A' is a very interesting listening experience, it may be a challenge at first, but should grow more satisfying with repeated listenings. <br />       Note: 'Kid A' will sound great on your hifi system! The opening keyboard sound in the first few seconds will quickly convince you of that, and from there on the excellent production becomes even more apparent. Also, in case you haven't heard, there is a hidden booklet underneath the cd tray, a bonus to compliment the already fascinating sleeve art.
B0000009SG|5.0|This one just keeps growing on me. The depth of the music is phenomenal. Just listen to how tight the horns are on &quot;Camarillo Brillo&quot; or how much Tom Fowler locks in a mean bass line for &quot;Dirty Love&quot; or &quot;Fifty-Fifty.&quot; Frank lets out mean guitar solos on &quot;I'm the Slime&quot; and &quot;Zomby Woof.&quot; Tight from beginning to end. A good starting point for those new to Zappa, and of course a great companion piece for &quot;Apostrophe.&quot;
B00005JKDR|5.0|Monsters enter through the closet doors of children to capture the energy of their frightened screams in order to power Monstropolis. All this backfires when a little girl enters the world of monsters and frightens the whole city.<br />Our family loved this show in the theater, and we recently acquired the DVD, which we may have enjoyed more because of all the additional features. The new animated short, &quot;Mike's New Car,&quot; is fun to watch, but not nearly as entertaining as the Oscar winning &quot;For the Birds,&quot; which was also shown in the theater.<br />We also loved the outtakes and the tour of Pixar studios which provides background on the people and the ideas behind Monsters, Inc. The only problem is: my son figures he'll be able to get a job someday where he can just goof around, ride scooters and have a pet chimpanzee.<br />We briefly watched and listened to the running commentary on the film, but will probably devote more time to this feature in the future.<br />This DVD would be fun for the whole family.
0783230710|5.0|Apollo 13, the movie, starring Tom Hanks, takes us back in time, to the historical moon space mission disaster.  An fuel tank has exploded reducing available energy and compromised possibilities of a moon landing.  NASA makes the tough decision to abort the moon landing and focuses on the larger problem of getting the men home.  This is NASA finest hour and the director leaves the viewer cheering as the men survive their ordeals.<br />Emergency response is by the book.  In other words the response has a guarenteed result.  NASA's think tank is a group of smart and young brains capable of solving difficult problems.  The problems are almost insurmountable: depleting battery power,  skip possiblilities caused by wrong reentry angles into earth atmosphere, heaters offline saving energy for reentry resulting is freezing temperatures, and air recirculation failure with no automatic backup.  NASA must solve all of these problems before Apollo 13 reaches earth after traveling over a million miles.<br />The air recirculation crisis has been raise as a top priority problem.  Working around the clock the team considers all the available resources, amount of power, and time remaining.  The group leader brings the supplies of the available resources and dumps them on a table.  The team must figure out step by step how to manual create an air recirculation system before the astronauts sufficate.  A solution is discovered and the steps detailed.  Command center verbally walks the Apollo 13 crew through the process of assembling an air recirculation system.  The system works and saves the lives of the crew.  Splash down was great and I cheered NASA acheivement and consider this a great film of the power of the human spirit.
B00006CXSS|5.0|I love this miniseries.  Despite all the high ratings, I wasn't sure what to expect when I bought the DVDs.  Fifteen minutes into the first disc and I was hooked.  Rarely has a war movie made me care more for what happen to the characters than the battle scenes.  The miniseries was superbly directed, acted and edited.  Even more impressive is the fact that it based on true characters and events.  I would rank this as the greatest of all WWII movies (or any war movies) that had ever been made.  I finished viewing the miniseries during the holidays and already feel like watching the whole set again.
B00000099Y|5.0|Do you like your music a little loud? Tired of [bad] pop and recycled rock? <BR>This is maybe the one CD I've listened to the most in my life and its opened my eyes to so much more than just the killer riffs and Maynard's unmatched voice. Two tips for getting into Tool:<BR>1) Don't listen to individual tracks- take the whole thing in at once <BR>2) Listen to the lyrics... or even better read them off the internet. Maynard is more poet that lyricist and you'll appreciate the music more when you get an idea of the mind-expanding concepts Maynard sings about.<br />I liked Lateralis, and Undertow is good for an early, unpolished work- but Aenima is Tool's masterpiece. Its the original work that eastablished Tool as the heir to the Pink Floyd throne as the thinking man's rock group.
B00000I01A|5.0|Rocky IV is one of the finest soundtrack albums of the 80's though it sold barely above one million copies. It refeatures &quot;Eye Of The Tiger&quot;, the Rocky III theme and Survivior's biggest hit in summer of 1982. And the dead of winter '86 hit &quot;Burning Heart&quot; also by Survivor. Furthermore it has full of surprises such as the return of rock'n soul legend James Brown with &quot;Living In America&quot; written by Dan Hartman known by the Streets Of Fire theme &quot;I Can Dream About You&quot;. King of soundtrack Kenny Loggins of Footloose and Top Gun fame offers great ballad &quot;Double or Nothing&quot; dueted with soul legend Gladys Night(one of the superstars who sing with Dionne Warwick's &quot;That's What Friends Are For&quot;. It highlights newer stars such as John Caffety known by &quot;Eddie and the Cruisers&quot; soundtrack, Robert Tepper with &quot;No Easy Way Out&quot; and UK pop star Go West with &quot;One Way Street&quot;. For melodic rock fans, Touch's &quot;Sweetest Victory&quot; is just unbelievable! Essential for 80's music fans and soundtrack collectors.
0151008116|4.0|In the first hundred pages of *Life of Pi*, Piscine Patel's religous fascination is explained to us in detail.  Piscine, or Pi, finds himself simultaneously interested in Hinduism, Islam, and Christianity, and he sees no conflict of interest between these.  Although he is a young boy when he discovers these religions, it is implied that the adult Pi retains, at least to some degree, his multi-religous fanatacism.  Pi's religous mentors cannot understand how Pi could believe in any religion but their own; to Pi, they all offer beauty, and are simply different paths to the same truth.  <br />Details of Pi's religous background may seem superfluous at first, but the ideas of believing and faith are central to the purpose of this book.  Pi's survival on a lifeboat with a tiger is dependant on his faith; moreover, the reader's faith in Pi is tested, culminating with a grand trial at the end of the book.  <br />One of the comments on the book's cover, which comes from something that a character said early in the book, is that Pi's story will make you believe in god.  The statement takes on a different meaning in the book than it does on the book's cover; I don't want to spoil any plot secrets, but basically it comes down to a question of why people believe.  In the book, the statement means simply that Pi's story is so incredible that you will not be able to believe it unless you believe in a higher power; it is a miracle.  The meaning of the statement on the book cover is something different.  It has more to do with individual choice -- with everything else being equal, would you rather believe in a world with a god or without one?
0316666343|2.0|You know, I usually pass on the hyped-up books, but I heard such great things about this one for so long I figured there had to be something to the reviews. I was very wrong. As I read I kept thinking that something would happen soon that would make all the fuss pan out. <br />I didn't enjoy reading this book, I didn't even hate it, I was bewildered and somewhat annoyed on every page. My most common editorial comment, out loud of course, was \\"Oh, please!!\\" while rolling my eyes and holding my stomach to prevent my nausea from overtaking me. <br />There was no poetry of language, no spiritual connectivity; it was just depressing and irritating. Two hours I can never get back.
B00006JDS4|4.0|i won't review the actual film I SPIT ON YOUR GRAVE here because so many others have done a great job. what i'll do instead is rate the \\"millenium edition\\" disc itself because, after all, the only people buying it will be those who truly understand what an incredible piece of work this film is. feminist horror! who'd have ever thought it?<br />*Commentary by writer/director Meir Zachi...finally we get to hear from the man who started all the controversy. he has a thick accent and it's hard to understand him at times, but you really feel bad for the guy. this movie got slammed so hard by critics that theater chains pulled it from their screens! he only directed one other movie. poor guy, so talented. critics are the worst.<br /><br />*Commentary by Featuring Cult Film Guru Joe Bob Briggs...the #1 reason to buy this disc! joe bob rules, this is up there with the best commentary tracks ever done. not only does he keep the discussion lively and informative, he balances it between joking about what's onscreen and giving numerous facts about the film. he proves that his knowledge of cult film (and film in general) is expansive, and his appreciation for this movie runs deep. every movie needs a joe bob commentary track if you ask me. well worth the $$$ just for this feature alone.<br />*Theatrical trailer(s), TV Spots...lots of these, and there's radio commercials too. cool.<br />*Animated Menu Screens...all incredible, just like the EVIL DEAD collectors edition. the scene index also has clips from each scene so you really know what's what.<br /><br />*Still Photo Gallery...this is actually an easter egg, it's not labeled on the menu screens. to access it, go to the main menu and press up till the word GRAVE is highlighted in yellow. hit OK and you'll see some neato stills.<br />*Reviews...great stuff, allows you to read the scathingly awful reviews the film got from some really famous critics. joe bob references these reviews several times in his commentary.<br />*Interviews...there are none. i'd have given this disc 5 stars if it had interviews like the LAST HOUSE ON THE LEFT disc has (cast reunion, director) none here.<br />*Foreign and Domestic Art...you can scroll through and look at video and dvd box art from around the world. in the menu screen it says you can look at posters for the film, but none are included.<br /><br />*Full-screen and widescreen letterbox formats...widescreen only (that's fine. full screen has no place being on any dvd release of anything ever).<br />picture and sound are exceptional too, i should add. this disc is definitely worth getting.film got from some really famous critics. joe bob references these reviews several times in his commentary.<br />*Interviews...there are none. i'd have given this disc 5 stars if it had interviews like the LAST HOUSE ON THE LEFT disc has (cast reunion, director) none here.<br />*Foreign and Domestic Art...you can scroll through and look at video and dvd box art from around the world. in the menu screen it says you can look at posters for the film, but none are included.<BR>                                                                 <BR>*Full-screen and widescreen letterbox formats...widescreen only (that's fine. full screen has no place being on any dvd release of anything ever).<br />picture and sound are exceptional too, i should add. this disc is definitely worth getting.
B000001FDK|5.0|The musical Grease, like West Side Story, is based loosely on the theme of Shakespeare's Romeo and Juliet, so we have the theme of opposing gangs, and the storyline of boy gets girl, boy loses girl, boy gets girl back. The movie of the musical is a wonderful seventies take on a fifties theme and I would imagine that most people who enjoyed the movie-- and there must be millions of them-- would also enjoy this CD.<br />You have quite a variety of performers here. Olivia Newton John, with her crystal-pure voice sings the movie's greatest hit Hopelessly Devoted To You, and then you have her in duets with John Travolta, who also has some solo numbers nicely done with an adolescent break in his voice that belies his maturity at the time of the recording.<br />Also from the movie are a couple of songs by Stockard Channing, one of which, There Are Worse Things I Could Do (Than Have A Boy Or Two) is one of my great favorites, even though it is rather short.<br />Then you have a bunch of period fifties rock and doo-wop songs by top artists like Frankie Avalon and Sha Na Na. Almost all the songs are enjoyable and very well recorded. It really is one of the best, probably THE best,  soundtrack albums you can get, better even than Dirty Dancing, which is also a favorite of mine.<br />Wonderful music for driving in the car, listening to while you do the housework, or just about anything else.

B00005JL96|5.0|---<br />As the recent crash-dive of *Treasure Planet* demonstrates, with *Lilo & Stitch* the Disney people set the moviegoing audience's expectations at a much higher level than they can sustainedly achieve.<br />In terms of plot, character development, visual artistry, ingenuity, insight into human nature, and the proverbial scientifictional \\"sense of wonder,\\" the corporate clowns at the House of the Mouse have allowed some genuine innovation to escape onto the screen, and as a result they're going to have a horrible time of it for the next couple of years. Apart from the stuff they're second-handing from Pixar, there doesn't seem to be anything in the Disney pipeline that comes close to the high level of quality joyfully splashed across the eyeball by DeBlois and Sanders in *Lilo & Stitch*.<br />One example of the sheer enjoyment this film can deliver to even a Certified Grump like me is the fact that although I've loathed Elvis Presley from the moment he was first inflicted upon the nation back in the '50s, the writers/directors of this picture actually made me *enjoy* every minute of Lilo's efforts to make a \\"model citizen\\" out of her green-card-less alien using the Pelvis as her template. Borjemoi!<br />...
